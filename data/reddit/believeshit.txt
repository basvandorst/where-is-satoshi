It's a sham, there are supposedly nine businesses in my region accepting bitcoin, I called them all and one actually does. Most don't know what I'm talking about when I ask them. The one that does is a very dodgy service delivering beer which takes about two hours to finally answer a phonecall.

This is why it's never good to compare multifaceted compex situations using only one or a few facets making up the equation. Amazon has been very much overvalued in the past their margins are razor thin to almost non existant but the share price has been in the stratosphere so a correction has been due for a while now.
Overstock has not been subject to the kind of hype Amazon enjoyed and I don't think they have historically been overvalued in the same way.
 
Ofc they are hardly competitors in the sense that just about anybody orders from Amazon and Overstock is much less of a one stop shop. Ebay shareprice I have not payed attention to in years and I don't know what happened YOY. They all share part of the same market that's what makes them seem compatible.
I think it has not made a real difference at all volume is tiny compared to their usd volume but it spooked investors hearing all the (for most normals crackpot sounding) libertarian talk and seeing the declining btc environment at the same time. Investors just don't see the kind of ROI they crave from all of this and these two factors play a role.
edit formatting and some better wording

the meaning of the very word reserve in this context or the one it normally refers to is empty fiction in reality
there is no backing but the full faith (eg fiat)

I don't.

let's be unrealistic to the max here. Say they drive it up to 10 000 000 a coin and all 21 000 000 coins have been mined into existance. Let's say there are none lost in any way. It would only amount to 21 billion funbux. Ok that is pretty sizable but given those pieces of paper and mostly digital entries are basically free for the people that run the printing press totally within the realm of possibilities. Yes that would cause a bit of a  weakening of the currency du jour but you bet your ass it's worth it for them to come out as top dog in case they have a competitor that stands a chance to ruin their run of things (not saying this is realistic remember) since it doesn't actually cost them anyting anyway. And in reality only half of those coins are mined and they will never be 10 million a piece whatever happens. A couple of billions will be all that it takes tops in any scenario and they don't have to spend it all at once either. They can buy on their orchestrated dips just like the big players do now. They spend trillions now.

You got me there. At first I thought it'd be 21 trillion looking at my calculator but I edited because I found some yahoo answer page or something that I trusted a little to blindly. We don't use the term billions over here (europe). I looked up (1000000x1000000). Turns out I'm wrong a factor of huge and out a couple of zeroes. Guess they won't buy them all then just stifle with laws over time.
you got my upvote for waking me the fuck up

You tell me. This simple metric in itself says a lot. It's like a vote of no confidence. You can probably find some anecdotal evidence elsewhere to support the theory I think you might be building up to but the fact remains that BTC is a part of the Overstock business model now and it isn't paying off in any meaningful way.

Sounds like quite the sensationalist if you look at his choice of topics. I would not hold my breath.

This is nonsense. The majority has nothing to do with it. Fascism is basically a marriage between business interests and state. Ofc the meaning of the term has been hollowed out and transformed to something meaning nothing much really (apart from bad germans bad mussolini axes of evil type binary bullshit) because well that's what the western world actually has for a governmental system. We are all fascists now. Cannot let the truth get out even though it is taking place out in the open. God people are easily distracted.

It would not be hard at all. They make the laws and they enforce them with literally infinate resources. As long as the dollar has any (perceived) buying power at all the cops, swat and the army will show up when told to and you can't hide on the water or in the air either because marines and airforce. You can't beat the government at its own game and they will shut you or anybody/anything else that they want down. They take down whole countries left and right for crying out load. You think a few 100000 keyboard warriors have any meaning in the grand scheme of things and you are wrong. Groups are composed of individuals. They don't go for the group but take down the individual. You have no clue how hard they can make things for you. They will label you a terrorist and come get you  No lawyer because terrorist. Bye bye, Gitmo for you. I really would like things to be different but they aren't. Don't forget they actually hate you for your freedom.
I never knew it payed so well to be homeless and that they are that frivilous when it comes to spending money. So I went on Google and I found all this proof. Thanks for pointing that out it's like a whole new world has opened for me.

asshole move
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:42:55
Agreed on both counts, the aholemove in this context is not making money but willingly throwing people under the bus to make up for losses they could have probably prevented and even if that would not have been the case socializing their losses by using easily swayed sentiment and insider knowledge. I think it's clear who "they" are and I think it's clear the other behemoths had a vested interested not to let this exchange go under.
I have nothing, I repeat nothing against making money. It's the way they did it that irks me.
