I'm wondering if the pay would be scaled with the price of current btc... for example.. if his monthly salary right 5,000 he'd get what the current amount of bitcoin could be purchased for 5,000... the benefit...  would be ... say last month 5,000 bought .5 btc... this month .5 is now 6,000.. he would only get paid .42 BTC... but last months salary is now worth more than it was when he got paid..

feels almost like the "living to work" vs "Working to live"
He didnt specify if he sold everything (that I read) so I mean he could have just sold a little... if that car brings enjoyment to his life then thats what counts...

That's sort of obvious, but that's the same situation investing in anything..  with the current trend it doesn't look like a decline would happen or be prolonged...  but I'm with basically anyone else who says it's a stupid thing to do... Considering you can just buy it yourself...

the intrinsic value is in the fact they're globally accepted and tradable.  Currently BTC is not, not saying it wont change, but currently there are few places to spend BTC and very few (in terms of total population) even understand it and anything around it.  Mining has become extremely demanding of electricity though...

Idk there are so many big players in it now that they're probably not concerned with small dips... I mean it took a 2k drop just yesterday (or was it wednesday?).. but idk.. I'm still not vested into it.. don't really have the free $$ to do so... as I'm still in my 20's.. I'd invest some of my 401k into it if I was able to do so..

Right.. the fact it's accepted everywhere doesn't add actual value.. makes sense..

I wish it was here xD... the upper end range there would barely cover my car note ($460)...

As someone who worked at Target for 4 years, this is not the case.  I was electronics manager for a year of that...  The *scam* is that they lower the model number for a lot of TVs and such that you think you're getting the one that is normally 599 for 299.. but in reality its a lower quality tv... and other things... But no the prices aren't exactly "raised then lowered"... and there are at times loss leaders in the store... ie the xbox deals... the store actually takes a loss on those items to get you to buy other things..

and the people on this sub appear to never lose confidence.. they'll keep on with the "buy the dip" or "get your discounted coins" even if it goes to 500 lol..  
but in all honesty I'd put some money in under 5k again... (currently in stock markets mostly)
