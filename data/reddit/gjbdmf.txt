It wasnt meant as an absolute assumption. More like if it isnt profitable to mine what the possible outcome would be. Asked out of curiousity 
Just one more question: are you saying the less people are mining the more profit for the average miner?

I’m not aware of any bitcoin atm in Amsterdam at all
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:10:27
Ah I had the idea you just asked for the best exchange. Straight from bank USD isn’t possible. Traiding pairs are BTC, ETH, BNB and USDT

Well he is aware of the gamble. That’s why his question is about the timing of the investment; not about the nature of the investment itself

In a bear market they’re all rather clueless

Well the price dropped 50% + you had to pay fee twice; there you go

Have you seen the “market cap” of fiat
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:18:54
Have you seen the companies backing it

Thanks for your opinion

Problem is if the price drops after receiving your paycheck like december - january
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:37:09
I mean if starting from this month you have to have at least some fiat to back up your liabilities (to pay rent and such) the first couple months in case the price keeps dropping
I like the idea though 
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:51:38
I don’t think it’s possible due to the easy chargebacks
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:49:41

Question now is what stronger in you; the belief Roger Ver is wrong or the belief BTC is the real Bitcoin

Don’t fool yourself 
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:01:49
Please try to do that. It’s actually very hard to be in top 5 cmc. And no I’m not into Bcash
@_date: 2018-02-13 09:55:02
So it can not be done 
@_date: 2018-02-13 07:58:23
It’s always wise to buy BTC

When prices are in a down trend for a certain period of time
@_date: 2018-02-10 09:34:24
How’s it possible it’s  on cmc though
