Others have elaborated. The most important thing to know is that you can only spend ALL of the coins in a paper wallet. 
In other words, there isn't any such thing as "change." So usually people spend their paper wallets on non-paper wallets (that's what I do). After that point, you can break it up into smaller amounts. But a paper wallet spends 100% or nothing at all.
Test it with a few satoshi first (as someone else said) and check the blockchain to make sure it worked (scan the left side and google it... it will hit the blockchain surely). Once you see your small amounts there, it boosts confidence.
This is what I did also.

I don't get it.

Oh, I don't want to sell them. But they are coolermaster with MSI motherboards and AMD processors. I put a higher-end AMD in the 3rd one (hexacore). The GPU's are Gigabyte 7970's.
I do have a 7970 for sale. It has minor damage on the heat baffles, but it has been tested and okayed by Gigabyte as working (I tried to get an RMA). PM me if this interests you.

I think you might be new to reddit. You're going to get slammed. Good luck with that. I consider myself to be a reasonable, rational person, and I decided that the best way to reddit is to lurk. 
That said, I'm going back to lurking in a second.
"Judge it by its fruits" -- means that money, be it dollars, rupees, bitcoins -- it's what you do with it that's going to be pro-Christ or anti-Christ. See ya.

What is the terminology for bitcoin that will never go anywhere. IE, a few months back I had the misfortune of installing the Android blockchain wallet, and lost 0.41 (wallet accepted the money, but would't spend it).
"Bitcoin at the bottom of the river" is likely not economic terminology.
What is the term?
How many BTC are estimated down there?

... It's true. I succumbed to greed. I admit it.
