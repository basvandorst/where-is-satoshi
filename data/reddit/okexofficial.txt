According to the BCC rules, from the block height of 478558, BTC and BCC will be split into two chains. However, due to the limitation of BCC hash power, we cannot estimate the exact time for the first block to come out. In response to a large number of users’ requests, OKEx has decided to enable BCC / BTC trading on August 1, 23:00 (Beijing time), 2017.
BCC might still possibly be a failure, so its price is unpredictable. We advise users to please trade cautiously.
After the first block comes out, and after extensive technical testing, we will enable BTC and BCC deposits and withdraws.
OKEx will continue to improve our products and strive to provide the best services that our users deserve.

Hello. To answer your question We are trying to build a one stop shop ecosystem, so although we don't earn directly from the escrow fees, the fact that the account is linked to spot and futures will encourage trading and the fees is where we earn :)

We have recently received numerous inbound requests from our users asking for further clarification on the related rules and operating mechanism regarding the maximum allowable order price deviation imposed on OKEx-listed futures.
**Why has OKEX imposed such restrictions on order price?**
The core rationale behind of imposition of a maximum order price deviation for OKEx futures is to protect legitimate investors interests from market manipulation and other intentional abuses.
In the absence of such a limitation, a handful of malicious traders could deploy a relatively small amount of capital with high leverage in order to trigger large price fluctuations within a relatively short time interval. The maximum order price allowed in placing an order will be dynamically adjusted from time to time taking, in order to take into consideration real-time market volume, volatility, gross/net open positions, and other risk parameters determined by OKEx.
**What is the OKEx contract pricing limit rule?**
Under normal circumstances, the maximum price at which a new contract may be opened is set at plus/minus 20% of the market price of the underlying index. The limit will be dynamically adjusted downward (ie. less than 20%) when OKEX’s market surveillance system takes into account the current market condition. Please note that unwinding holding positions will NOT be bound by this limitation (maximum order price deviation). Other trading rules however will still prevail.
The following case study illustrates this situation. So if the latest BTC/USD index is 2448.65:
The highest price for open long ≤ 2448.65 * 120%
The lowest price for open short ≥ 2448.65 * 80%
**What is the BTC Dollar Index?**
The BTC dollar index is a price-equal-weighted index managed by OKEX which takes into account the last price as quoted by the six largest BTC exchanges globally. The index price is calculated in accordance with all of the exchanges’ current exchange rate, converted to US dollars. The BTC dollar index is quoted in points, where 1 point equals $1.
The LTC US dollar index released by OKEX is based on the weighted-average of the world’s largest five LTC exchanges, which reflect the LTC’s global market price changes. The index price is calculated in accordance with all the exchanges’ current exchange rate converted to US dollars. The LTC dollar index is quoted in points, where 1 point equals $1.
To learn more about the index, its calculation rules and methods, exchange rate adjustment rules for index calculation, etc., please log in to our official website at  and to see more information, please follow our official blog 
**Thank you for your continued support. OKEx will continue to innovate, in order to provide an ever-improving product and service to all of our customers.**

Dear OKEx users,
BCC (BitcoinABC) is launching soon. To protect our users, OKEx has decided to take action related to the BCC launch starting on July 31 20:00. Our policy is as follows and are in three stages.
Stage 1: July 31 at 20:00
1. OKEx will suspend BTC withdraws, and suspend transfers between spot and contracts accounts on OKEx. In addition, we will also halt the chain split token product between Old BTC, BCC and BCS.
2. As transactions for chain split trading BCC / BTC and BCS / BTC will end on 20:00 on July 31, you are advised to complete all orders before then. Beyond this time, our system will automatically revoke all remaining available balances and transfer your balances to your OKEx spot account.
3. OKEx will determine user’s BCC and new BTC balances in a clear manner. The calculation for BCC will be the user’s number of old BTC in your spot account for which you will receive BCC 1 to 1, plus any BCC you may have purchased in advance on our chain split trading product. The calculation for the new BTC will be the user’s number of old BTC in your spot account, for which you will receive new BTC 1 to 1, plus any BCS you may have purchased in advance on our chain split trading product. New BTC will temporarily during this transition stage be named BTC (BCS).
We give an example calculation below:
At the time of July 31, 20:00, suppose a user’s balances on OKEx are 10 Old BTC (Spot), 5 BCC (Chain Split Token), and 3 BCS (Chain Split Token). The total distribution of BCC into the spot account will be 15 BCC (10 BCC distributed from the BTC balance + 5 BCC from Chain Split Token). The total BTC (BCS) balance will be 13 BTC (BCS) (10 Old BTC + 3 BCS from Chain Split Token.) User’s total balance is 15 BCC and 13 BTC (BCS)
Stage 2: August 1 at 12:00
1. OKEx will suspend bitcoin deposits as well as suspend any transfer of bitcoin between OKCoin.cn, OKCoin.com and OKEx. In order to not affect your trading experience, we advise you to deposit bitcoins in advance.
2. For any BTC deposited into OKEx after August 1 at 12:00, there will be a delay to credit your account. The specific delay of any deposits will be addressed in a later announcement.
Stage 3: The First BCC Block
1. BTC (BCS) name will change to BTC based on market conditions
2. All users of OKCoin.cn OKCoin.com and OKEx will receive their distribution of BCC on their OKEx spot account directly. Users will be notified again on this matter.
3. We will officially launch BCC / BTC spot trading on OKEx for buying and selling BCC.
We kindly remind you again:
1. From August 1, 2017 at 12:00 to August 3, 2017 00:00, in order to prevent replay attacks we will halt Bitcoin deposits and withdraws. In order to not interrupt your trading experience, we recommend you deposit bitcoins in advance.
2. In order to prevent replay attacks leading to a loss of either BTC or BCC, the OKEx technical team will be conducting extensive testing, and the resumption of deposits and withdraws may be earlier or delayed.
We hope you continue to count on OKEx for innovation, stability, as we strive to build better products and services for everyone.

Dear users,
In recent days, the proposed Bitcoin forks have become a widely followed topic. We at OKEx in our previous announcement have shared our view that our platform will focus solely on providing the best service and will grant the choice of bitcoins to the user. OKEx will provide all types of Bitcoin to users after the fork and when the network stabilizes.
The following is the market assessment of what is likely to occur during the potential Bitcoin fork period.
1. BIP91 (SegWit2x/NYA) Currently, the majority of miners are in support of BIP91, and it is likely to become the mainstream version of Bitcoin and the successor to the current version.
2. Bitcoin Cash (UAHF) https: // otherwise known as ‘bitcoinabc’, has received the clear support of certain miners and exchanges. Further, with its dynamically adjusted mining difficulty, it is very likely to exist. However, as it appears only a minority of miners will be backing this fork, it is likely to be a new digital asset that coexists with Bitcoin.
3. BIP148 (UASF) is proposed by SegWit supporters and is designed to cause activation in all existing SegWit capable nodes. As the activation of SegWit2x follows these standards, and as the ‘2MB’ hard fork aspect may not be until October/November, the chances of a BIP 148 hard fork is slim at this time.
BIP91 implements SegWit, optimizes the data structure of the Bitcoin blockchain, increases the network’s transaction throughput, and fixes transaction malleability. This will be an important milestone in Bitcoin’s development.
Bitcoin Cash reflects the interest of those supporting big blocks and is another technical solution to scaling Bitcoin. It has the potential to find many applications and areas for growth.
As a result, BIP91 and Bitcoin Cash are likely to co-exist. We have named the two potential blockchains BCS (BIP91) and BCC (Bitcoin Cash), and use the name BTC to represent pre-fork (old) Bitcoin.
Starting from 2017-7-23 18:00, OKEx will support both BCS and BCC trading against old BTC. In order to show our support for Bitcoin development, both BCS / BTC and BCC / BTC trading will be 0 fees. The trading product details are as follows:
1.Before the end of the fork period, BCS and BCC cannot be deposited or withdrawn directly, only traded. Users can choose to convert BCS and BCC back to old BTC. For example, 1 BTC is equal to 1 BCS and 1 BCC.
2.Before the end of the fork period, BCS and BCC can be traded against old BTC.
3.At the end of the fork period, and when the network stabilizes, OKEx will stop BCS / old BTC and BCC / old BTC trading.
4.If there is no fork, BCS and BCC will be converted to the old BTC (1 BCS + 1 BCC = 1 old BTC) after trading is stopped. If there is still BCS or BCC remains after the converting, the remaining coins can be traded to BTC at their last price.(abnormal transactions excluded)
        e.g.
        on AUG 1st, no fork occurs.
        Account balance is 15 BCS and 10 BCC;
        BCS/BTC last price is： 0.99 BCS/BTC;
        If all converted to BTC: 10 BTC（10 BCS + 10 BCC）and 4.95 BTC（5BCS x 0.99 BCS/BTC）;
        Thus, the balance should be 14.95 BTC in total.
5.If the fork occurs, afterwards, BCS will take the name BTC, while the BCC name will be unchanged, and can be traded normally in the market.
6.If you had old BTC converted to BCS and BCC, then after the fork period, BCS will directly become the post-fork (new) BTC, and you can independently deposit and withdraw new BTC and BCC.
7.If you had old BTC on OKEx and did not convert it into BCS and BCC, then after the fork has occurred, OKEx will grant you your respective new BTC and BCC.
8.After the fork period, and when the network stabilizes, OKEx will then launch BCC to new BTC spot trading.
9.This product only affects OKEx spot trading. It has no impact on OKEx futures trading.
10.BCS and BCC are two possible outcomes from the potential Bitcoin fork, and trading in each carries great risk. Users are advised to assess their own personal tolerance to such risks and should not blindly decide to trade.
11.Starting from 2017-07-31 to the end of the fork period, OKEx will halt bitcoin deposits and withdraws. In order to have a smooth trading experience, we recommend that you deposit bitcoin in advance to prevent interruptions. OKEx will resolve all technical issues as a result of the fork, and provide all types of Bitcoin to our users.

Since its release in 2009, Bitcoin has gained unprecedented global influence over the past eight years. Bitcoin’s progress was a natural evolution of the internet. It has also ushered in new possibilities for the evolution of our society and today counts itself as the most reliable public blockchain in the world. Bitcoin has the potential to be the basic infrastructure on which emergent blockchain applications are built upon and play a major role in our new economy.
Over Bitcoin’s recent years of rapid growth, several different development paths and proposals have emerged within the Bitcoin community. Some have advocated for expanding the block size in order to handle more transactions and increase network throughput. Some have proposed introducing a new transaction format and upgrading the data structure (SegWit) and developing second layer technologies such as Lightning Network in order to increase transaction throughput. OKEx is proud of and thankful for all experts and developers for their commitment to the advancement of Bitcoin. We believe that the fight for the future of Bitcoin have been based on technical ideas, not on conspiracy theories, or politics amongst various companies and organizations.
In our everyday lives, the technologies we enjoy have similarly emerged from their own controversies and growing pains. For example, Windows Mobile, Nokia Symbian, iOS, Android competed in the market for years until iOS and Android become widely accepted. Similarly, today’s China’s high speed rail network is a result of years of market competition between different technologies such as magnetic levitation versus wheel-based high speed trains. As for Bitcoin, we believe that market competition should be the decider of what technology prevails, not summits or political pacts in support of one option or another.
OKEx as a company is dedicated to building the application layer for Bitcoin, and our purpose is to serve the best interests of each and every one of our customers. OKEx does not and has no power to help users choose which kind of Bitcoin technology to adopt. Our stance is that OKEx will support all competing forms of Bitcoin, and grant each option to our customers and the market.
Officially, OKEx is preparing for the upcoming potential Bitcoin forks with the following policies:
  1. During the potential fork, from 2017-07-31 to 2017-08-02, we will suspend Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals due to potential technical risks such as replay attacks and other issues that may cause network instability. We will further advise on specific timing but we advise that you deposit Bitcoin in advance in order to not affect your trading.
  
  2. If there is no fork, and the network is stable, we will resume Bitcoin deposits and withdrawals.
  
  3. If Bitcoin is split into several blockchains, OKEx will for every blockchain give users their rightful ownership of their Bitcoin. In addition, OKEx will take steps to support trading for every type of Bitcoin. On OKEx contracts trading, for existing undelivered maturities, the calculation of the Index price will be the sum price of all Bitcoin types of the respective exchanges should they support them. After delivery, new OKEx contracts will be tied to a particular version of Bitcoin, and OKEx will take steps to support contract trading for all types of Bitcoin. For undelivered maturities, post the splitting of Bitcoin, when adding margin funds, all types of Bitcoin will be required.
  
  4. In all these circumstances, the easiest way for uninterrupted trading is for users to deposit Bitcoin in advance and OKEx will handle all resulting technical issues related to the potential Bitcoin forks.
  
  5. If unexpected events occur during the potential Bitcoin fork period, OKEx may temporarily also suspend Bitcoin trading. If we deem someone has maliciously manipulated the market during this period, OKEx may take measures including the suspension and roll back of trades.
We believe in the years ahead, after a long period of market competition, one or several versions of Bitcoin will be widely adopted. Let us all work towards that future together.
