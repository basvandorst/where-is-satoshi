Chart is really misleading. The 'jump' is actually due to a 5.715:1 consolidation. Price before the consolidation was roughly 0.05, price after 0.3. So actual 'market value' of the company hasn't changed all that much since it was delisted and relisted today. 
If you're interested have a look here  to see the transition from MEJ -&gt; DCC through a reverse takeover.

If I remember correctly, our largest producer NCM has cash costs of around $800, you would need to delve into their statements/reports to calculate all-in costs.
I believe FML was one of the mines that shut down, massive dog of a company, but just an example that owning gold in the ground is not by itself important. I'll chase up the other couple if you like.
Basically, all I was getting at is that, an exploration company does not derive value simply because they own gold in the ground. It has to be feasible to extract that gold, and a lot of the time, it's not.

Thanks! Both points cleared up nicely.

You can't just throw 6 bucks at the ground and get gold. The lowest cost gold producers in Australia have around $1000 all-in costs per oz of gold. Just recently, a number of producers have halted production because the gold price is too low and they would lose money extracting the gold from the ground.
