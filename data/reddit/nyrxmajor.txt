50% chance of a ban? It’s already being traded in futures. The next step is ETFs. Absolute zero chance of a ban. You know what else funds terrorism? The almighty US dollar. Might as well ban that too.

A lot of people.... not everyone lives in poverty or their mom’s basement dude. There are plenty of doctors and lawyers who make mid six figure salaries. Or people who live in low cost of living areas and have inexpensive houses with a decent combined salary. Who said anything about 1 stock? I said funds returning 10% on average maybe 75/25 stocks to bonds. You never heard of an ETF? SPY or vanguard funds. Also I said multiple dividend paying stocks. Who the hell said one? And this would be a small percentage of that 2 mil but still a regular guaranteed quarterly dividend. Learn some reading comprehension. Also why do the kids need their college paid off for you to necessarily retire. Maybe they have scholarships or take out their own loans that have nothing to do with you.

Her starting salary was 60k and she worked her way up to mid six figures which probably was the last year or two. 450k salary is in a 40% tax bracket do you even math? I’m sure she maxed a 401k and traditional IRA use your brain dude. Also says she made 40% of her net worth off investments. Don’t be fucking dumb and use exact numbers to justify your logic. 7 years of compounded gains is a large chunk of that 2.25 mil. It’s unusual but possible and age 40 will get you there with a much lower salary as I said many times already.

Lol you’re a fucking moron it’s pointless to argue with you. I then mentioned people in low cost of living areas who have 100k homes and a reasonable salary say 150k combined. They can save 2 mil by 40 if they so choose through smart investing and tax advantaged accounts. Yeah you say you know them but do you know their net worth? Maybe their lifestyle and spending habits exceeds their ability to save for retirement so they are forced to keep working to keep up. Or maybe they just like their jobs enough to stay. You said in your first post that it would take you 30 years to spend 2 million after 65 and then I prove you wrong by saying you will have more than that in your account when you die from investment returns in stocks and bonds. Not everyone invests their life savings in crypto and hodls to the moon.

Lol dude is this a joke? That 2 million dollars is invested into certain funds which will probably return close to 10% on average. Your cost of living amounts to almost nothing if you have a paid off house. Literally you are paying for food insurance random bills and household shit and gas for your car. You can essentially withdraw 3% or 60k and still be easily in the black every year on average. Read a little bit at least if you want at least a clue about retirement math. People with 2 million are retiring by 40 easily. If you have dividend paying stocks that’s even easier.
