You are doing it wrong. You have one bitcoin on one exchange and one bitcoin on another exchange.  No transferring time needed. Take advantage of the difference in prices that way. Think about it.

People say you can sell in cash in person to avoid capital gains tax from something like a hardware wallet because there is absolutely no way to prove that you even sold it to the person let alone the amount you sold it for. In this situation you would have no records for the IRS unfortunately ;( Or sell on any exchange over 20k to fiat and pay like 30 percent of gains to the government. Let me also add to this however that you are putting your life in danger doing this because when you show up to sell this person knows you have bitcoin on you probably large amount. However usually in person bitcoin sells for a little less than current market so they have reason to make legit transaction. Just be careful bring a weapon.

No because a paper wallet has your private key just sitting there for anyone to steal where a hardware wallet the private key is on the device and harder to get to. If you have more than a thousand dollars worth of bitcoin I would recommend a hardware wallet. Why risk all of that going away with a paper wallet. Also what others have said.

You need at least 80-100k worth of hardware to make mining even altcoins profitable in addition to the knowledge of how to set it up correctly without messing it all up with bitcoin your talking about probably 20 million or more in hardware to make it profitable and you need solar panels to power all of it

A small amount of bitcoin will always be lost due to lost or failed technology.

Safety deposit box at the bank, keep your hardware wallet and seeds in there. Its the safest place for them and kind of funny that you are keeping crypto in a bank vault.
