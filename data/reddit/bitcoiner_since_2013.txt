Technological limitations. We can wish for whatever we want, but it's useless if it's not possible to do. This is why we have proof of work, not because we like to spend electricity on creating a ledger that does not have a central authority but because no one knows any other way to do it without spending that energy. I wish we could, but that would be just like you wishing we could have one currency for all.

So much garbage in that article. This makes me glad we are in a bear market, these scams need to die off and stop dragging Bitcoin down with them.
Ripple? Seriously?

We **are** getting ready for the final battle but not by being dishonest.


You make some great points but Bitcoin is not fast and cheap, it is secure and censorship resistant. If you want something fast and cheap I have plenty alternatives for you - which all have sacrificed the most important properties that made Bitcoin unique or never had them in the first place.


Ackchyually, it would be great if this was true, but it is unlikely because the only way to prevent a financial crisis is for governments and financial institutions to provide a better solution and make Bitcoin useless, guess what, they won't.


We still have a lot of improvement to do here, we are using a public transparent ledger after all. Going off-chain (lightning) certainly helps but building this infrastructure takes time.

So you want a market for gift cards and laws to force Target to do the things you want instead of what Target wants and you seem to have a problem with rich people? Well good luck with that, nobody is forcing you to use Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:24:42
Okay sorry if I misunderstood. I don't see how you can force Target (without laws) to do what you want while you let them control the ledger, it's not in their interest to do the things you want them to do.
@_date: 2018-10-22 16:53:42
Well if you make a gift card universal what you have now is money. 
If your gift card or whatever form of money is not universal you will need an exchange rate between gift cards and a market

Proof of Work is the lesser of two evils, the other being a central authority. Pick one or provide a better solution.

Exactly, people will dump all the garbage and in the end they will only hold the gift card that keeps its value and can be spent in the most locations and can be held over the longest time, without losing value. What kind of special gift card would this be? Bitcoin

That's the difference between Bitcoin and altcoins. Protocols don't have partnerships, they are a foundation on which anyone can build.
Does SMTP (e-mail protocol) have partnerships? No
Does TCP/IP (internet protocol) have partnerships? No
The moment your protocol has a partnership it's no longer a protocol, it's yahoo mail instead of SMTP, its Internet Explorer instead of HTTP.
Can you ask the leader of gold for me about his partnerships? thanks.

When you do this you are not spending it, you are storing $8,000 worth of value in Bitcoin. It's called saving, not spending:

Transactions have inputs and outputs and when you subtract total outputs from the inputs of a transaction what is remaining does not stay in the input but goes to the miners as fees.
A normal wallet will automatically create an extra output to send the remaining back to yourself (a change address).
When spending from a paper wallet it is best to sweep all the funds to a wallet you control and then spend from there.

Probably someone trying to spend from a paper wallet and trying to test with a small amount first, not knowing how Bitcoin transactions work and what change adresses are, thus losing everything.
It can still happen today, many people have paper wallets and have no clue.

The protocol rewards miners to order valid transactions.
What is "valid" and "verified" is defined in the protocol which is enforced by anyone running a full node.
If a miner puts an invalid transaction in a block he will get his block ignored and receive no reward.

Thanks That is indeed what it is - a popular belief - spread by news outlets who no longer have journalists or put any effort on fact checking and just repost each others garbage.
The next time someone says Bitcoin is anonymous, show them this: 
Some of the best engineers in the world today are working on making Bitcoin more private, they are not stupid, they know Bitcoin is not anonymous and it needs to be fixed.
There is a small positive angle to this, which is that we can catch more criminals because they thought they were using an anonymous currency instead of a permanent public ledger with their transactions.
@_date: 2018-12-02 13:23:05
Yes I run one and it's important that bitcoin users actually use a full node instead of relying on a bitcoin service providers. Bitcoin was meant to remove intermediaries, not replace them with other intermediaries.
The reason people don't use full nodes is because it can take hours, days or weeks to set one up compared to alternatives that take less than a minute.
What would help is if we had an in between solution that would be useable as soon as you start it, like a light wallet today, but would become a fully validating node in the background.

That's fine, no need to force anyone one to use anything, just be glad you have choice now, maybe one day you need it.

You want to learn about Bitcoin but the first question you are asking is about buying bitcoin. There many ways to learn about buying/holding/trading Bitcoin, but realise that you will have learned nothing about Bitcoin.
If you want to learn about Bitcoin you need to learn about what money is as opposed to how to get or use money.
 is a great start, and you will probably lose a couple months (or years) of your life to this if you get it.
If you are not prepared for that and just want to get rich quick (or broke) might be for you.
@_date: 2018-12-30 17:29:41
Reusing the same address for multiple transactions was always a bad idea but more for privacy than security and it has nothing to do with the older address scheme or the HD scheme, in both cases new change addresses were used, the only difference is that with a HD wallet you can restore all your addresses/keys from a single seed where as with the old scheme you had to make back-ups of your wallet.dat to get your keys back.
