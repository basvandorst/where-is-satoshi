Yeah, I got one of these sub-creatures too randomly messing me on Discord.  Don't worry. He's not alive anymore, wink wink. Nah just kidding, I just... hmm... what did I do? I don't remember. Might've been drunk and enraged at his insolence.

I'm aiming for 8600, then begin the bail on my short. Things aren't looking up right this minute though. Made another meme, opposite of this one. Just shot past 10500. I don't like!

The banks must at all costs be destroyed. Those wielding power through the banks must not be permitted to keep this control over the entire world. What's worse is that powerful bankers like that love to network and wield power over people not just by the power of monetary value alone. Do you honestly think that they don't invest heavily in means of mind control? Lobbying their version of indoctrination to schools, to TV-channels, to newspapers, news media, and broadcasts, to forge movie narratives, distract people, appoint people with suitable distraction enemies to direct their anger at as people are divided and conquered further, becoming weaker, less healthy, less happy, more malleable and obedient consumers, all while becoming poorer. In spite of becoming much poorer, the industries have shifted to abundance of useless products that have no inherent value of their own. Compare how easy it is to fill your life with state-approved propaganda music and movies and snacks compared to owning land, buying houses, be debt free, organize your fellow friends into saying no to oppression - try and leave the EU and see what happens. They would attempt to crush your little country. And they could do so entirely without raising a single soldier to that goal. All they need to do is block your commerce, boycott you, etc. Our only hope for the future against these evil people are their hubris.

Oh no! Not 58! That's awful!

I'm just happy that the over 9000 meme can be recycled over and over again!!

Psst. Yo. Expect Bitcoin to go down to 7200 at the lowest. It's not going to fall lower than the weekly EMA ribbon before bouncing back up and continuing the bull run. So don't worry that now in the immediate future it's going to go down down down, as fast as it went up up up.

Consider gaps in the bitcoin futures chart. Gaps "likes to be filled". And look at how after blow off top there's been three waves, up and down, up and down. When those waves are finished, and maybe even gaps down at 7.2k level are filled, that's most likely when Bitcoin is gonna shoot through the freaking roof and finish this year at 20k or above. Could be 40k, who knows.

I was pretty angry because I went in for one of those bitcoin miners at a bad time. Lost me 1.2. Now I'm thinking oh alright, I'll listen to the best analyst I know and go for the big opportunities when opportunities look as fine as this. Like honestly, if it goes to 8k from here, I'll have made my moneys back!

I think it will probably go all the way down to the weekly EMA ribbon and then bounce up and start some more delicious climbing!! It's how it usually goes. Stay frosty. Trade intelligently. And if you wish you had a cheat-sheet to make you do most of all the right decisions, check out The Moon Carl on YouTube! Thanks to him I earning a ton today. x3

I think EMA ribbon bounce. Fast down. Fast up.

Learn to trade it. Then volatility is exciting. If price falls a bunch, that's exciting, because you stand to make more bitcoin off of it through leverage trading. I recently got into doing it on Bybit. And if you're a little bit iffy about trading, guess what. They offer a test playform where they let you paper trade to learn the ropes! Jesus, I start sounding like a freaking commercial. But this is all true. Hell, I made 105 bucks today in Bitcoin current value on their platform! Just be responsible with it bruh.
