Jesus Christ you’re a twat. I was just asking people to conjecture based upon that assumption cos it’s pretty common around here. And by mass adoption I just mean it gets more popular and goes up in price.
I really hope you get some enjoyment out of being a dick, cos otherwise you must be fucking miserable

Question. I've been wondering for a little while now.
Assuming we do get mass adoption and all us early adopters get our tickets to the moon and all the lambos our hearts desires, do you see a mechanism in bitcoin that can prevent severe income inequality?
How I see it playing out is that a lot of bitcoiners will get incredibly rich (some already are), but also those already mega rich from the current fincancial system will probably make even more as they have so much more to play with.
So I guess my question is, do you see it actually making the world a more equal place? If so, how?
Please bear in mind, I'm huge on bitcoin and want it to succeed along with a number of other decentralized technologies, but I worry that it could become another amazing technology that just gets used by rich people to get richer.
I hope I'm really wrong, but I'd like to hear someone articulate a brighter future for me to cling to as we ride to the moon.
