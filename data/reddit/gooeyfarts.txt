@_date: 2015-05-01 15:31:44
oh I see. I thought you were talking about brute forcing the public key ;)
@_date: 2015-05-01 03:03:43
I laughed out loud, partly because I recently sent a wire transfer and it was shit horrible.
1$ @_date: 2015-05-08 19:33:13
last I checked satoshi didn't piss away millions of dollars due to his incompetence. Mark Karpeles opinion means dick.
@_date: 2015-05-01 05:06:59
please explain?

Its a quote from *Dune*

I think what people are missing is that 20mb is just a stop-gap solution until a more elegant solution is available.  
@_date: 2015-05-08 19:47:08
Nice try Mark.
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:23:33
I will not fear. Fear is the mind-killer. I will face my fear. I will let it pass through me. Where the fear has gone, there shall be nothing. Only I will remain.

He did. He made the first bitcoin "alt-coin" called "test net"
@_date: 2015-08-15 19:04:30
well where is their code?
I'm running XT until I see something better.
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:30:59
Cool, I just uninstalled Bitcoin Core and installed Bitcoin XT.
XT full nooooooooode
@_date: 2015-08-15 20:19:02
Wow... so true...
@_date: 2015-08-16 09:16:57
The point is though that they beat the game!
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:39:01
Right? 
Whats going to happen to this sub when consensus moves Bitcoin to 8mb Blocks. 
Will the mods just have a sticky post filled with all their butt-hurt?
@_date: 2015-08-16 02:54:39
You should look up "twitch plays pokemon" 
It involves twitch users voting on actions the main character makes in the game. Its a great example of what herds can do in spite of malicious opposition within the herd
@_date: 2015-08-25 19:30:40
here, you dropped this: \\
@_date: 2015-08-11 19:08:31
well I'll run whatever will support big blocks, and XT is the only one I know of.
@_date: 2015-08-11 17:35:17
oh wow, I might have to start using Voat more often...
@_date: 2015-07-27 21:32:02
I don't think I can do anything to keep Ethereum from being immediately obsolete. 
@_date: 2015-07-01 16:44:52
oh, this should be a PSA.
I've got my full node running on my HTPC so I don't look at it too often...
@_date: 2015-07-07 06:36:21
and 20x more expensive :p

This picture hasn't really changed much since 2012
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:29:04
3$ is still waaaaaaaaaaaaaay cheaper than western union.
3$ is what I'm charged just to pull 20$ out of a ATM.... hmm....
@_date: 2015-07-27 17:58:03
ha ha "Threat to Bitcoin"
I've only heard that from LTC, DOGE, RIPPLE, Quark, fuck, what else... I'm sure there are more.
Go pump your altcoin somewhere else. Like your own sub.
@_date: 2015-07-08 18:41:13
A long time ;)
You can google about re submitting the transaction with a higher fee. What wallet are you using? 
I've done this with bitcoin core a few times when I didn't put in a decent fee...
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:38:19
well said. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 04:05:34
Its true. Used be BTC GUILD, Deep Bit and Slush at ~50% between them or more. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 23:41:09
Oh, now you've given away too much... /s
@_date: 2015-04-30 00:25:29
It starts with a lower case l
@_date: 2015-04-30 06:22:09
Lets put your comment in the wayback(tm) machine to 2011, when the price was $1.92 after it crashed from an all time high of $32:


@_date: 2015-04-30 01:58:13
draw a picture? I cant see it
@_date: 2015-04-30 03:27:26
you need to remember that bitcoin is same as cash unless you use a third party. You would be giving bits to a complete stranger.
I think it would be better if a whole bunch of people donated small amounts to the wallet, and we could donate the money to something worthwhile in 10 years.
I think this would be great of course, but in reality I would have to urge people not to do this. Its incredibly unwise, and though I may be trustworthy, there is a veritable sea of scammers out there that do not possess my moral conscience.
However, it doesn't matter. There could be a million dollars in that wallet, and no one would be able to brute force that key in this life time,  no matter the power of their computer.
But now I'm rambing, the answer is no, at least not through me :p
@_date: 2015-04-30 12:53:25
thats 156 Octillion years. 
Protons may have decayed by then :I
@_date: 2015-04-30 12:22:15
no I will not tell you the length.
It takes that long by design. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 13:58:26
FPGA, is this 2013?
@_date: 2015-04-29 23:39:09
The address will remain loaded for the next 10 years. On April 29th 2025 I will withdraw the funds.
edit: also, I might send more BTC to that address so... yeah.
edit2: this was implied, but please give this to your friends. I need redundant backups.
edit3: You guys... do not send money to this wallet. Come on. Save your bits for yourselves people.
edit4: [verify loaded here](

These are neat videos! Thanks for posting, I'll use these in the future

eating asbestos will still give you cancer. There is not part of asbestos+human body that is null or good.
@_date: 2015-04-30 04:55:35
I'd be kind enough to give people updates every year.
@_date: 2015-04-30 06:08:38
Nah... anyone else is free to do it. I just like having this on standby the next time someone tells me how insecure bitcoin is. :p
@_date: 2015-04-30 06:51:53
You wouldn't think. There are people out there man that are so uninformed and biased. The whole premise of managing your own money is so scary and alien to them that they think it can't possibly be secure and is the equivalent of hiding cash in a mattress. I had this discussion today.
@_date: 2015-04-30 01:08:37
you'd have better luck with a knife maybe. Also, if you found me. 
@_date: 2015-04-30 00:59:26
I have placed the passphrase in a capsule and since ingested it. The capsule is wrapped in multiple layers of gum and asbestos.
@_date: 2015-04-30 16:49:49
nah, I make joke. 40&gt;180 in two years? Thats outstanding returns.
@_date: 2015-04-30 16:43:08
666 bits @_date: 2015-04-30 15:26:31
Few people would be willing to make a paypal deal, so I'll just make a donation.
$5 If  you are in the states, try using coinbase or circle. If you think you could be in it for the long haul and want better rates, open an exchange account at bitstamp or some other exchange.

@_date: 2015-04-30 00:43:44
its all 1s.
Also, I might be lying.

*we need to go deeper*
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:15:58
oh damn. whats 180k in 2015 dollars?
@_date: 2015-04-30 01:15:02
one of the many risks we take in life I guess.. :I
@_date: 2015-04-30 00:46:44
I thought the QR would be enough :I
@_date: 2015-04-30 01:05:53
oh... its got plenty of entropy don't you worry.
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:29:49
wolfram agrees. damn.
@_date: 2015-04-30 01:56:13
Yeah, I got it.
@_date: 2015-04-30 14:55:17
you have been downvoted for stating fact. I feel you. 
Take this to ease your pain: $1 @_date: 2015-04-30 13:55:03
The main reason I'm not worried:
* Persons, with known names and locations who have STOLEN many times as much coins worth in the millions had no problems avoiding all the internet assassins.

but this is not certain.
This does not give me confidence in my asbestos parfait 
@_date: 2015-04-30 06:07:13
I don't think you understand what's going on
@_date: 2015-04-29 23:46:10
It's probably a small island. Imagine what 164k people from reddit there would look like.
@_date: 2015-04-30 03:11:58
@_date: 2015-04-30 05:01:29
Yeah, don't waste your time.
@_date: 2015-04-30 02:42:56
won't need to! &lt;:D
@_date: 2015-04-30 03:09:40
There is no puzzle really, just an assertion that I'm confident enough to leave the encrypted private key out in the wild on the net for 10 years and collect my funds in 2025 ;)
But if its fun for you, go wild!
@_date: 2015-04-30 16:42:03
And recently its been as low as 180. Bitcoin has clearly failed, is scam, has ponzi sandwich, and must report.
@_date: 2015-04-30 02:20:33
On April 28th 2025 I'm going to win a fight with a stranger.
@_date: 2015-04-30 15:08:40
Now I don't know if I'm telling the truth or not in context to the comment you answered.
