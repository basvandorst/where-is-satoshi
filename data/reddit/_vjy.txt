Creating an altcoin is like creating a new rare metal like gold; creating a potential bitcoin competitor. Somehow similar to, or as difficult as, building an iPhone-killer, or Google search killer.

Private ownership or control
According to the Congressional Research Service:
Because the regional Federal Reserve Banks are privately owned, and most of their directors are chosen by their stockholders, it is common to hear assertions that control of the Fed is in the hands of an elite. In particular, it has been rumored that control is in the hands of a very few people holding "class A stock" in the Fed.
As explained, there is no stock in the system, only in each regional Bank. More important, individuals do not own stock in Federal Reserve Banks. The stock is held only by banks who are members of the system. Each bank holds stock proportionate to its capital. Ownership and membership are synonymous. Moreover, there is no such thing as "class A" stock. All stock is the same.
This stock, furthermore, does not carry with it the normal rights and privileges of ownership. Most significantly, member banks, in voting for the directors of the Federal Reserve Banks of which they are a member, do not get voting rights in proportion to the stock they hold. Instead, each member bank regardless of size gets one vote. Concentration of ownership of Federal Reserve Bank stock, therefore, is irrelevant to the issue of control of the system.
According to the web site for the Federal Reserve System, the individual Federal Reserve Banks "are the operating arms of the central banking system, and they combine both public and private elements in their makeup and organization." Each bank has a nine member board of directors: three elected by the commercial banks in the Bank's region, and six chosen – three each by the member banks and the Board of Governors – "to represent the public with due consideration to the interests of agriculture, commerce, industry, services, labor and consumers." These regional banks are in turn controlled by the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, whose members are appointed by the President of the United States.
Member banks ("[a]bout 38 percent of the nation's more than 8,000 banks") are required to own capital stock in their regional banks, and the regional banks pay a set 6% dividend on the member banks' paid-in capital stock (not the regional banks' profits) each year, returning the rest to the US Treasury Department. The Fed has noted that this has created "some confusion about 'ownership'":
[Although] the Reserve Banks issue shares of stock to member banks...owning Reserve Bank stock is quite different from owning stock in a private company. The Reserve Banks are not operated for profit, and ownership of a certain amount of stock is, by law, a condition of membership in the System. The stock may not be sold, traded, or pledged as security for a loan….
In his textbook, Monetary Policy and the Financial System, Paul M. Horvitz, the former Director of Research for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, stated,
...the member banks can exert some rights of ownership by electing some members of the Board of Directors of the Federal Reserve Bank [applicable to those member banks]. For all practical purposes, however, member bank ownership of the Federal Reserve System is merely a fiction. The Federal Reserve Banks are not operated for the purpose of earning profits for their stockholders. The Federal Reserve System does earn a profit in the normal course of its operations, but these profits, above the 6% statutory dividend, do not belong to the member banks. All net earnings after expenses and dividends are paid to the Treasury. In the American Political Science Review, Michael D. Reagan wrote,
...the "ownership" of the Reserve Banks by the commercial banks is symbolic; they do not exercise the proprietary control associated with the concept of ownership nor share, beyond the statutory dividend, in Reserve Bank "profits." ...Bank ownership and election at the base are therefore devoid of substantive significance, despite the superficial appearance of private bank control that the formal arrangement creates.

BitLicense sounds good (?!). Here are my (half-baked) understandings. Correct me, if I'm wrong.
1. BitLicense is for merchants (few), so bitcoin customers (many) don't have to worry about this.
2. Strict license will improve government / general public confidence, and with this bitcoin will get a good image.
3. I doubt (10%) bitcoin fungibility is at stake.
4. BitLicense is not mandatory, so non-bitLicensed merchants are going to co-exist with them. I'd say, BitLicense is halal market, but this will not stop others.
5. It would make regulatory hurdles easy for merchants. Any questions from government, they can point finger at BitLicense and say we're BitLicense compliant.
6. It would bring in more business for the licensed, but not going to affect other merchants.
7. If you operate on more restricted, more transparent license then that could be your selling point. You can proudly say, we're more transparent than bank and national exchanges.
Edit: 7.

Talk to phone manufacturers and ship it with offline brainwallet / bitaddress, or some other plugins (greenaddress / blockchain / bitpay)..

We have seen deflation / fixed suply was just fine. Without inflation, existing ethers would be valued more down the line.
Miners would also get fees from the beginning.. IMHO, ether inflation was just not well thought of.

lol. Is that a joke from that dictator movie?! :)

Just buy some bitcoins worth of a coffee, or lunch. You will know what it feels like to own bitcoins. Don't worry it's over $500 now, you can buy as much as you want, say for $10.
Now try to understand. Read, watch videos, etc. 
Buy more, as you gain confidence in bitcoin..

Third option is also possible. Like, gold. It will be there, along with other fiat and crypto currencies.

Upto $1000, just use any trusted mobile app; for example, android bitcoin wallet app.

They are also tracking hashrates. I often (few times a week) visit this site to check harate graph.

May be Satoshi was 'thinking' about it, for a long time..

I guess, ether inflation is a  miner incentive. Not all miners would be able to participate in the Genesis sale. Without this Ethereum network is not expected to bootstrap itself from zero.

Let's say top 100 banks maintain, and sign a global ledger, then that would be as good as bitcoin blockchain. They could effectively take mining out of the equation, and falicitate sub-second global transactions, zero fee remittances, etc.
Although, they could freeze any fund. Except this, a global ledger and blockchain, are all the same.
And, that top 100 banks thing, is less likely to happen.

RMB/USD goes above 6.2, which is considered dangerous.. I'm not sure this is anyway related to the recent ban.

How's that? Do you allow us to use 'bitcoinwallet' wallet name with, any public address we specify? Without importing private key?
I checked FAQ, but didn't create my wallet yet.

I was part of a KNC Saturn group buy. It was 8 weeks delay, because of that my investment didn't ROI. So far, I got only 30% of my bitcoins.
I don't mind bitcoin exchange rate, but I'm not happy if I don't get my BTC back..
I've decided to stay out of Neptune, for few months.

There's also one more bitcoin investment firm where minimum is €10,000.

It's not wealth distribution, as this is nothing to do with mining power. People who was mining most coins would still be mining most of the coins.

Why Fiatbit?
We need a bitcoin subunit that's better than mbtc, ubtc, bits, or satoshi, and also close to various fiat currencies.
We can't use one subunit all over the world, so we need a method to standardize which subunit (10th, 100th, 1000th, etc. of btc) we are currently using in a particular part of the world.
Introducing fiatbit.. in US, it's dolorbit.. in UK, it's poundbit.. in China, it's yuanbit.. and, so on.. you can also use usdbit, gbpbit, yuanbit, etc. if that sounds standard.. :)
Fiatbit changes with the fiat, and exchange rate. You can always buy 1 to 10 fiatbit in your unit fiat.. not more, not less.
I'd like to compare this with stock splits / merge.. total no of fiatbit exists increases / decreases with exchange rate..
Fiatbit is neither fiat, nor BTC.. but, it represents both. 
1 btc = $7256.5432.. dolorbit is now 0.0001 btc, written as $₿4.72565432
$₿4.72565432.. 4 represents we're dealing with 10000th of BTC, 0.72565432 is the price of that dolorbit (one 10000th of BTC)
