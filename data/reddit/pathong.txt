Wait. Coinbase went down when the market crashed? Isn’t this deliberate market manipulation by large cooperation’s?

You do realise that the majority of Ethereum is brought and sold for bitcoins.

"This transaction could take a long time to confirm or could be dropped due to the low fees set by the sender"
It says it right on your screen bro.

Good luck finding a trader willing to trade with a new account thats unverified with zero feedback.

Buy bitcoin

Back down to $10. You heard it here first

You forget Bitcoin catered to a small minority for years long before any of the hype train came along. Everyone seemed pretty happy back then.

Buy all the dogecoin you can in my opinion

Bitcoin reacts to market influences which are completely random.

How are companies like coin base or one of the half-dozen significant trading platforms not becoming the new 'Banks'. Sure you might hold you personal coins in a personal wallet. But at the end of the day if you hit roadblocks trying to buy/sell they become worth less. Looks at the recent coin base outages. Thousands of people couldn't utilise the service to trade their coins. I saw countless threads here with people bitch. How many of you utilise only one trading platform. Many require extensive verification processes often taking day/weeks. Convenient if you need fast service. Look at the countless threads made bitching about the poor customer service or people having problems with trading platforms. These platforms are becoming large enough to manipulate the market in their favour.

You think coinbase went down by accident when the market fluctuated? I assure you they are trying to manipulate the market.

Only 1 in stook. Not for long.

Dump these on the market for cheap slowly over like 2 months and watch everyone panic as the price drops signifcantly. Worth the Lolz

Id recomend localbitcoins NEVER had a problem.
@_date: 2017-06-12 22:24:55
I buy with local bitcoins. We have like a dozen traders in my country. The price fluctuated so fast they havent even had time to adjust their prices.

Because you've built your trendline around existing or past data. You can't predict the future.
In its simplest form, the economics of supply and demand dictates price. You may be able to make predictions on short-term influences and events affecting supply and demand with reasonable accuracy. Long term it's considerably harder and less accurate or impossible.
If you had a magic formula you'd be able to go back a few years say 2014 and use all data before that point and none after to run your simulation again and match it against confirmed future data after 2014 for accuracy. Try it and see if still accurate.

Localbitcoins. Cut out the middle man and transfer straight to the seller. Its worth it.
@_date: 2017-06-11 12:47:49
So you're telling me i should have started a wallet company instead?
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:13:09
Its even worse in New Zealand. Currently at 4344.00 NZD. The lack of local traders has pushed the price up in the local market places. Its almost impossible to find any at a decenr value.

This. Most people epically new comers to the community are not interested in the core principles behind bitcoin. All they want is to make a quick dollar.
