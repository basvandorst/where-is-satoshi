Some people fell in love with A.A about banking the world with extremely low fees and low barriers. But now that dream is crushed by high fees and the ''other 6 billion'' will have to find another coin. The game has changed

Bitcoin cash solves that problem, 8mb blocks can do 8x the number of transactions. You are paying pennies and its quicker

Sell BTC for BCC/BCH, fees are way lower and you can transfer quick to your exchange if it is supporting Bitcoin Cash. You can also transfer it in ETH or another low fee coin.
