I asked the same question, but Net Neutrality was only introduced in 2013 (or 2015, don’t quote me), and was fine before that

Pretty much, I feel insane lmao

Don’t. It’s your wedding.

Yeah buy you just save the seed so you can restore if something like that were to happen. And for stolen, they’d have to get past the PIN, and other security layers.
If you don’t have your keys (which you do not in an exchange) you don’t have your bitcoins

Now’s always the right time! I’m pretty new too, welcome and HODL!
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:34:01
Of course. I told them all to not invest recklessly and to be careful :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:16:22
I'm sorry OP. :/
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:16:22
Well, lovely as it is, GDAX doesn’t allow me to use their service in my region :))))

This makes me scared that Coinbase will be next. I just want my Ledger Nano S to arrive now.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:52:33
Don’t do it again. Don’t use money you can’t lose, glad you got out :)
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:30:48
Not your keys, not your BTC.
You need to invest in a Hardware wallet. Best choices are the Ledger Nano S or the Trezor. If you’re unsure if it’s worth it - ask yourself, would you be sad if you lost your cryptos?
If you keep your BTC in an exchange like Coinbase and they end their company - you lose your assets. A hardware wallet is bulletproof, and if you lose your device you can restore it. Happy HODLING!

14.4k, in 2 minutes WHAT

I have bought all my BTC with PayPal. It’s not through an exchange, but people can do it - the only catch is that you lose a lot to fees etc
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:39:52
LMAO HOLY
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:37:43
Hodl so hard!!
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:45:40
I see, thanks! Yeah, the fee was big but it’s fine. Just wanted to get it out of there ^^
@_date: 2017-12-05 12:39:06
With these two hardware wallets you’ll be 110% fine :)
It’s easy, a few fee’s though obviously, but this is as safe as it gets. If you’d prefer you could do paper wallets (YouTube it), but you know my recommendation!
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:48:37
Don’t keep stuff on an exchange. If the exchange dies so does your BTC. Get a Ledger Nano S or a Trezor :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:25:36
Good advice! 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:57:41
No, not the one I used
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:27:42
4 whole bitcoins? I’d cash out, atleast some. You can sell through Coinbase without a prob to EUR wallet on there. They have a fee but yeah

In any healthy marriage - Communication is key. You have to tell your wife, ask for help from her to stop trading so this does not occur again. I wish you the best of luck!
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:30:35
I bought at 9K, hoping I can say the same soon :)

I bought my first share today! Some BTC, ETH and LTC. Now to train my patience!

To be honest, the reason I did it was because I exchanged certain Steam items on a website that buys the items and gives me BTC. ETH and LTC was bought out of my curiousity, and not by the site that bought my items for BTC. If you want the site - PM me.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:25:06
Coinbase! Really simple and easy - I’m new too. Looks like it just crashed in price a bit, so I’d hurry :)
