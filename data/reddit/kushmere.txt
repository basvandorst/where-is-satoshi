For what it is worth, I have been using CoinURL for about a year for my [blog]( and for a [buddy's gambling site]( I've talked to the owner many times, but Alex once or twice. I've had no problem collecting, just got my most recent payment today. A good group to work with. I hope your issue gets resolved, and next time I talk to the owner Ill mention this thread.

I have bought 3 times from Premium Gift Cards. Always fast service. Twice my orders didnt go through during the 1 hour window, but each time when it did finally confirm (many unspent inputs), a simple email got it fixed within 15 minutes. Both times.

Never underestimate the ability of the government to inflict its will upon its citizens. That being said, I more agree with you than disagree with you. I think we will see growth in value and adoption directly relative to each Central Banks actions that may come in the near term future.

You can wait until the price goes down. It will eventually. Until we have a 50% crash, I think I will feel like it is in a bubble. I'm not hating on it, I LOVE bitcoin. I know it is the future. A non-government fuckable currency. So many firsts in history are claimed by Bitcoin.

Sweet Salvation works great as a pepper relish sauce. Old Time Religion is about as hot as Cholula. I should know, I crafted the recipe and the "color" of cholula was a strong influence.

The first seizure of hard assets by the Eurozone is coming, possibly later today in Cyprus. The traffic on my blog today has been unreal, should easily be my best ever.

yeah, something like.000000003 BTC from EarnFreeBit per user. 2K viewers sent over to Bitvisitor earns me like .002 BTC. Coin ad is pretty decent, 10K clicks has almost made me .05 BTC. So, clearly I'm rolling in Bitcoin right now. Thus far, Ive earned about .2 BTC for like 30 hours of work. :-)
**Seriously**, I just wanted to make one site with ALL the links, developed over time to be a real resource in a clear format with explanations and ratings.
Some of the links have ads in the way, but **every** post I remove some of the ads, and transition ads over to the newest sites only.
@_date: 2013-04-09 20:06:42
Lots of good links to resources on my [blog](
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:40:28
:-) sorry you lucked out with the ads. I am not as poor as I was in college, so I greatly sympathize with you. There was more times than I'd like to remember that a 50lb bag of rice was the solution to hunger. Truly, I feel for ya man. 
I can tell you that the *most* profitable links on the blog should be ad-free. I usually look on my stats for Wordpress and find which of the coinurl links are most often clicked, then remove them.
Bitbucks, earnfreebit, bitvisitor, and coinvisitor are all pretty good. Coinad and Dailybitcoins are also good for hourly payouts. 
If you are good at blackjack, Bitvegas is worth checking out. It requires Minecraft, but they *GIVE* you .001 every 15 minutes just for being there. Once you get to .005 you can xfer out of your account.

I don't think so, the reason the prices are down the last few days is also related to the piss-poor month of March. There were a few whales, including one that posted on reddit. With any gambling based enterprise, you will have bad months and good months. Last month was a bad month, and those looking to turn a quick coin were disappointed, thus the sell off. 
Most people get excited when they buy something valuable for below cost.
I also use havelock for sdice.
@_date: 2013-03-30 03:51:56
To each thier own. If you believe the long term value of Bitcoin is closer to 0 than it is to X (x being your own belief of long term positive value), Then it makes sense to keep them in Mt. Gox. If you think the long term value of a Bitcoin is $ * X (x being relative to your central banks' masturbatory frenzy), then naturally keeping them in your own secure wallet makes sense.
Shit, now I just hope I make sense.

Yes. Also, I forgot to mention that back when this was started, only 10% of the company was put into shares. Erik and the private owners own 90%. So, the dividend is only 10% of earnings and averages around .15btc/unit.  Wait until we have a huge outlier dividend, people will flock.
Also in march, One of the investors sold some shares on the open market, so the dividend is now 13%, monthly.

Cash would be valuable, assuming people haven't lost faith in it and that isn't related to why the internet is down. Still, most people don't have *that* much actual paper cash handy. is correct, Banks &amp; Credit Cards would be useless. Of course, if youtube and cat pictures were not available I expect an instant riot from the citizens. 
Gold is nice, silver nice too. But once again, amount of physical on hand is an issue. Gold is also notoriously difficult to move in large amounts. That whole Executive Order 6102 thing is an issue as well.
Also, the idea of an internet "kill switch" is kind of a fallacy, atleast as far as I understand it. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:00:49
yes, currently invested. 
Price has been dropping since March, when it was reported on Bitcointalk.org about the whale. 
I do think it does, but i'm not ready to make a call one way or the other.
I may have bought at an avg of .4 BTC/Share, but that was when they were $50/BTC. Now they are significantly more. Even if I sold mine now for .2 BTC/Share, I still made money and made dividend from March.
I'm not worried, and at these prices I am a buyer.

In all seriousness though. Make a post at Bitcointalk.org or try sending a tweet to Erik Vorhees, the admin.

If this doesn't scream virus, I dont know what does. I've seen $5 crack deals look less sketchy.

It is absolutely amazing how true this statement is. People are and will continue to figure out that they don't have to play by the old rules of money: Put your money in a bank, leave it there and get raped by inflation and theft [fees], then die and give 1/2 remaining to govt.
I have been getting tons of traffic out of Europe on my [blog]( tons of Spaniards especially. They see what happened to Cyprus, and they know their Government is just as broken.

Been using since April. First for Satoshidice, now for ASICM and Sandstorm since I love weekly dividends. No complaints. Sent them an email for a feature request, heard back a day later.

Do not use bitinstant. For the love of god, DON'T.

Take a look at my blog, might find some resources to help you scrape together some Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-04 12:29:49
Yes! This is the suggestion I make at my blog. It is a very good site, and I have been very impressed.
@_date: 2013-03-24 10:08:55
I got frustrated that *ALL* the good links either: 1)Weren't all together, or 2) Not checked for errors, dead links, scams, etc. Its only been up for a few days, but i'm very proud of it.

No, I meant Share with everyone what the total was. As in tell us how well it turned out for you. What route are you going for investing?
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:37:31
Without a DOUBT, the answer is [COINURL](
A huge number of bitcoin related sites (the ones your potential customers are on) already use them. I use them (advertising &amp; clicks) and I am very satisfied.

Hey, we really hope you enjoy our Hot Sauce. Let me know what you think, and i'll throw in a second bottle for free with your next order.

HEY! Thanks so much for recommending my blog! I'm genuinely glad it has been helpful to you. I have a new post going up tonight, including a special commentary. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:10:33
If you are looking for some BTC to play with and get used to the system, please check out my blog. There are over a dozen sites on there which give away free amounts of BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-03 18:27:24
:-) shame doesn't factor into bitcoin. You may have all the money you need, but I do not. Not asking for a handouts, just saying how it is. It doesn't cost users anything to click through. I don't apologize for trying to make some btc by providing an often updated list. My donators and regular followers seem to approve, and I haven't had but three people complain to me (four including you) from the 23k views I've gotten since March 20th. 
I do appreciate your input though, and I admit I am VERY shameless with the plugs. But, virtually everyone seems to appreciate the site and I guess Ill just keep doing whats been working.
If you check the older post history, you will see that I *remove* some interstitial ads from each post. Last night 3 links posted, only 1 with a clickthrough. I also removed a clickthrough from another link.
Again though, thanks for the input.

Please anybody feel free to add link suggestions.
@_date: 2013-03-31 21:54:53
Oh yeah, how soon?
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:26:24
I'm going to let someone better equipped answer this one. But I am not sure what you mean by send out like physical items. "some BTC to play with" doesnt mean you will actually hold it in your hands and play airplane or something.

I am not a financial analyst, tax adviser, or lawyer. I am not responsible for anything, ever. The disclaimer says so on the About page of my [blog]( BUT:
It is my understanding that if you are mining bitcoins you would take the cost of the equipment + Cost of electricity - gains from selling for your taxable value as a business or income.
As for the concept of Capital Gains... You didn't really make a capital gain. You mined it (worked for it). You didn't buy it and watch it appreciate in value.
Hopefully someone can be more helpful.

What, all 6 of thier employees. What does that take, like 5 minutes to execute?
If that was a joke though, bravo.

I doubt any of the Cypriot gold will hit market. Probably just move cells at the FBNY Manhattan Vault from Cyprus to Germany.

Anyone wanting to avoid Facebook, feel free to ask questions here and I will answer them. I also have a page on my Bitcoin Blog with some details.

As far as bitcoin investing goes, I really like Havelock Investments. Still pretty small, but I've done a couple of buys through them and no complaints at all. the Monthly earnings don't hurt either. Link to them on my [blog](
