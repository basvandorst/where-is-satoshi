They're still going to be quite profitable due to the NPV (wow aren't I smart using finance terms !!!!)
Here's a handy guide:

They can earn 5 million a year, someone did those numbers. 10 million investment depending on their equity is pretty damn lucrative.
No shit losing 5 million dollars is terrible, you want a pat on the back for that analysis genius?

Well I had all of my money in fiat and it wasn't over $10k, but who knows what will happen. I'm just saying that many people lost twice. I can only imagine how much worse others must feel about this
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:38:18
I lost twice. Is that karma?
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:46:55
It's sad that this makes me feel a lot better...

end of bitcoin for me
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:50:13

That's not how ETF's work, you can't redeem the assets they are backed by

There was 40000 btc volume on bitstamp the day of the hack. Can you math?
@_date: 2015-01-07 19:14:49
guessing that's insider info that bitstamp is coming out alive

Not good, but who wants to be behind a company that just lost 5 million dollars. Let's not over think this. They haven't said anything about pulling their funds, they are probably not going to.
They had a 10 million investment , 5 million of bitstamp was lost. We can expect the cashflows to be worth much more than 10 million to them, 5 million is just one year of bad return.
