They can make it bitcoin's not mt.gox's problem. A lot of bitter people who missed the train dream of saying "I told you so."

More like two months can't go by without some shit happening.

It's the irrational belief part, that makes it a cult. Doesn't matter if bitcoin is logical and sound, it is "bitcoin will end wars" that makes it a cult.
Properties of an idea or a product (Apple) have nothing to do with the irrational belief.

To be honest he is just saying he didn't understand a thing about it. He seems to be having a laugh at himself and is not saying that it has no value, just that it has no value to him for aforementioned reason.

What is this? How could he even fucking type this shit? It's unethical immoral fucking low life attention grabbing tweet. 
Now we can believe that the documents were real. That means that gox guys are idiots. They lost all that coins and now we are to believe that, scheming and illegal shit they planned for would save them? And just like that, to throw the blame on a person who revealed it? The poor guy is loosing it as it is.

Yes 1 transaction with 2 outputs, and one is my own wallet address. One hour ago. I have withdrawn from btc-e without problems, waited for 6 confirmations, then sent it to Bitstamp.

I had an idea last night. It came to me while I was waiting for Windows to re-install on my offline computer(I had plugged in a USB flash to copy an offline wallet, and I like to play it safe). 
Would it be possible for bitcoin foundation to issue a standard, agreed upon, denominations in a form of a paper wallet, that would be use for direct exchange between users? 
They could invent ways to protect counterfeiting, for instance print on linen  fibers, or even invent some kind of a security thread that would be embedded in the paper wallet itself.

Simple. She opens up an account on the exchange so she can sell them. Verification lasts from couple of days, to a couple of weeks. She'll need a statement from her bank and a passport scan.
After that she needs to withdraw the money from the exchange, pay the withdrawal fee, wait for a work day or two, go to the bank, pay the processing fee and get the cash.
You send her say $2000 at almost no fee. She gets them in about half an hour. Than just three hours later gangy has $1920 because price dropped only $16. 
But if BTC goes to the moon you'll be her favorite grandchild, and there are things money can't buy, but, for everything else, there is ...you know.

This is exactly the type of article that people used to describe as serious and professional, when they were attacking 2bitidiot for being an attention whore. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 11:23:14
2bitidiot was BSing all the way and then admitted it himself. And his ranting was forgotten, because nobody wanted more bad news in a bear market. 
"waiting for 2 months because of downtrend and then posting two days after the first growth trend appeared"
I  guess we see different agenda behind this. I look at this move as preventing it from doing much damage. Not many people pay attention to bad news in a bull market. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 05:34:39
Well I could not believe the authenticity of the documents or bear the implications, but it seems like the story is gaining more and more credibility. 
Even if it was bs you stuck it to the whole world so congratulations. 
Seriously, You seem jumpy and defensive, I can't imagine the stress you're under. Take a deep breath and keep fighting. I appreciate it. Thanks

Well if author wanted to bring the price down he could have done it during the panic in April.

Your belief that by battling trolls you are doing a greater good and saving something, and his that he played a role in saving Apple in the 90's, is what makes you two cultists. And members like you are the cult. Not bitcoin nor Apple.
