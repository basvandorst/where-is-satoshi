You can still put your trust in a third party if you choose to. Just leave it in coinbase if owning your own Bitcoin is too complicated. As long as people understand the risk. It would be nice if FDIC extended to Bitcoin, but I've got a $100 Trezor, and seed words in a safe deposit box ($35/year), with contact information to help my wife manage the Bitcoin if something happens to me. Not really that complicated or expensive.

Yeah, you have to reduce your risk profile as you get more crypto. When I only had a couple hundred bucks in BTC I just left it on coinbase (I feel I can easily trust Coinbase with a few hundred bucks).  When I got more serious, I needed to change my security methods to accommodate the increase in value. I'd guess my family has a few hundred bucks in jewelry laying around the house. If I had a few thousand laying around, I'd need to think about putting that in the safety box as well.
I trust Coinbase more than the security on my laptop, so I went from storing on Coinbase directly to a hardware wallet. If you have more than a few grand in any asset you should research how to secure it. With crypto, the learning curve is a little steep, but secure and friction free once you're there.

Did it move the price at all? Has anyone tried finding a correlation between the moment the fake news started breaking out, and the price? Because I tried, and it's as if it didn't even happen.
