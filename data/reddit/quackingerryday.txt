It has, for quite some time.

And their dev teams

There's always LocalBitcoins, which probably has lots of sellers in Bogota. There is also this exchange:  I suggest you look it up in Latin American bitcoin forums to see if it's trustworthy. Cheers.

Brazil too

This one?

I'll assume in this post that you know already about the technical details of wallets and safely keeping a private key/password/recovery seed, and all the inherent risks of investing in cryptocurrencies. You can buy bitcoins in sites like localbitcoins.com, in which people put different Sell and Buy ads, and in which there's an escrow. Another popular way to buy bitcoins is to use an exchange. There's a Canada exchange, quadrigacx.com, which is probably the most convenient one to use, as they use CAD. Look around into those sites to see how they work.

Yeah, I'm moving soon, and selling afterwards

After some point, people sell so that their losses are cut, and thus the price falls more, which makes more people sell, etc...

Diversifying into ethereum is probably a less risk, less gain kind of thing, as it's kind of like a hedge against bitcoin.

That was likely a clipboard virus, that makes you paste the attacker's address instead of the intended one. Not much you can do now if that transaction has any confirmations. If not, you could try a CPFP or a RBF

Activation period ends in ~2 days. They meant that taking into account current BIP91 signaling they probably won't get to 80% at the end of this period.

Checking process explorers when the system slows down / fans are on all the time is a very good suggestion. Also, remember that if you use a hardware wallet, the private keys are never in contact with an internet-connected device, and you might as well be using a completely malware-filled PC and still transact "safely" (be careful with what copy-paste does, though).

transactions on a 4 MB block are also "unfairly cheap" compared to transactions on a 1 MB block. This is a non-argument used a lot by guys at r/btc, Ver and Jihan.

Remember: paper gains are just that until you sell.

Yeah, I've heard very good things from developers too :) I'm just trying to relay what the guys at the other sub say about SegWit.
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:05:19
As far as I've seen, they say it's an overly complicated solution to a simple problem, and that it shouldn't be implemented a soft fork because it creates technical debt (i.e. lots of lines of codes, so coding afterwards becomes harder) and the way SegWit transactions are seen by non-SegWit nodes.
