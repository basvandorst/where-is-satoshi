Ah i thought it was in an offensive sense. Then no problem man!

I don't get why i would be an idiot for posting ''alt-right'' memes if i find em funny. You are implying some sort of judgement of my person based on my political views which i find actually racist/intolerant.
And as i stated on another comment i don't follow politics so i don't care of memes implications (nor i knew that this green frog is somehow racist, mb coz im not from the us idk) as long as i find them funny, especially on the Bitcoin reddit. If this was posted on ''alt-right'' or ''left-right'' forums then i would understand positive/negative judgement.
Please be more tolerant to different political views and don't attack persons on baseless assumptions thanks

Disclaimer: 
1) This is a meme, im not implying that i would like to revive Hitler or Stalin with it. I didnt even know that this frog is somehow racist in the us but imho if something is funny i laugh regardless of the political side :/
2) This is a meme, im not implying i quit my job or i sold my house to buy btc :/

Ahaha few months when this goes more mainstream and they will already start to be very nice imho :-)

Yea just a joke man, actually in the current state i believe more in other currencies but btc will forever be our symbol

I’m ok with new internet people being offended by literally everything nowadays but i’m really not sure what part is THAT much offensive to be compared to Hitler.
Is there any logical explanation? I see a frog holding a btc :s
Even if its vaguely related to Trump anyone that studied history and has iq&gt;bonobo-monkey wouldn’t put Hitler name even close to Trump, let alone to this dumb image.

Had a friend with an enormous fb page doing that as a job actually LOL demotivational something, some years ago

All hoping for dips lol, that's called support line and that' why it wont go to 6k lol
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:15:19
As much as bcash ones. Trash coins in the current state, both of them. But at least one is decentralized

Pajeets: buying btc at 20k
Banks: investing in blockstream in 2016
Yea keep telling me how the people are smarter than banks.
And i don't see the future, i just guess that banks want control over the tech they use instead of being manipulated by few mining companies. I prefer to trust banks (the world's economy) than few chinese miners.
Are banks using Microsoft or Linux? Go figure

Not sure how what do you trust or not trust matters to the world financial evolution. What matters is what will see world wide adoption.
Hint: it's private and permissioned.
(even tho some public ones will be needed but for different reasons)
@_date: 2018-03-17 06:56:38
That means nothing, it's not even an answer. I'm implying that there's no scarcity of Bitcoins since it can be divided exactly 100 million times (Satoshi), so there will be no need to fight for ''1 Bitcoin''. Also you are assuming that Bitcoin is the next world's standard, which is wishful thinking at the moment.
But i guess moon lambo kids from this reddit can't get basic inferences lol
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:41:32
Why it matters when i can buy 0.000000001 BTC lol
@_date: 2018-03-17 07:00:45
Soon i will be able to. And even less, a millisatoshi. If you know what Lightning Network is.
So the whole ''not enough btc for everyone'' argument is laughable at best.

That's exactly my point. Neo rose cause it was actually used a lot (+speculation due to FOMO), once its main feature was limited it obviously fallen (+ negative speculation due to stampede expecting it to go to 1$). Would be toxic thinking that a currency has to duplicate every other day forever. They will have real use cases other than speculation, and as we have just seen governments can plummet easily the speculation, even with laws that protect the users (ie. limiting the scam icos to protect people). That's the actual proof of what i said: they are trying to make Neo a standard for people that wanna use it and not for brainless holders. If you put out the NEO coin value, the Chinese law made it better and more safe for real world usage. That's positive, not for few reddit sharks, but who cares.
I actually used Bitcoins back then and the demand was always wider. Today the demand is wider but it exists only to hold and hope that it will do 10x every year, and if you are studying economy/finance you will know why this is wrong and why governments will have to make a choice on what to do with it (even for the simple reason that they simply HAVE that power, and have many ways to do wathever they want). Big names decide the future, not a bunch of greedy nerds with deep tech understanding and 0 economy basics (few wiki researches are not solid basics). 
Then we can throw couple of conspiracy theories like "chinese did it on purpose to stack Neo in their pockets" but that's not the point, if they make it better it will rise due to actual usage and wider adoption so they will gain a lot with it anyway. If two icos out of three are a failure then long term Neo would be bad. Again we have to think in years, not in how to make huge gains in few months. If we want to get rich in few months we reason in a different way and with this volatility it's just a mix with knowledge, brain and luck (like the stock market, but here we can invest as little as 1000€ to possibly make 100k in an year or two).
Feel free to attack my reasoning, i hope too that i'm wrong, crypto is god and my bitcoin will be worth 50k dollars in 3 years.
ps: Neo should rise so who's holding anyway is doing a good thing

Who's behind banks can make laws, and that not only means that btc is in their hands, but also the whole internet (what if they change neutrality? Who of the new gen would really care?). The problem is that all the states should decide togheter on a very complex subject that their leaders don't understand, just hope they won't understand it for few years and make huge gains. If btc becomes world wide bingo my friend, but don't assume that, don't assume that they can't stop it. Do it for yourself.

Free, unregulated market. Bitmain is free to hold even 99% of BTC consensus. 
That’s why true decentralization as a concept is pretty naive.
@_date: 2017-09-08 03:11:08
Maybe it won't be Bitcoin and maybe this is all a big pyramid scheme/bubble/wathever, but there's no doubt at all that few cryptos (that we still have to see developed imho, backet by governments probably) will be the future.
