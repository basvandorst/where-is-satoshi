trip, the Committee has concluded that digital currencies and their technologies present a
variety of opportunities. In the Committee’s view, it is likely that the innovation underlying these
currencies and technologies has applications that have not yet been imagined. There is evidence
that they reduce transaction costs, increase the choices available to customers and merchants,
protect users’ identities and record all transactions. A key focus, then, is the actions that the federal
government and other entities could take to maximize those opportunities.    
...    


digital currencies, technologies and businesses outweigh the challenges. The Committee is
confident that the implementation of our recommendations will have positive outcomes for
consumers, merchants, digital currency-related businesses, Canada’s financial services sector and
others. The Committee looks forward to timely government action designed to maximize the
opportunities and manage the challenges facing the digital currency sector.

It's cheaper because there's some inefficiency somewhere in the gift card transaction system. If laws/credit card companies fix that and people stop getting unwanted gift cards, the margin will go down

What about that awesome new freezable homemade waffle recipe you found but you can't seem to toast it right?

How long have you been following?
If price just shot up from $200 to $600 would you say the chances of the price to double after that were the same?
Study stock markets. Things don't just go up one way. It's called a correction.

you can

@_date: 2015-09-29 00:46:59
**TLDR**    
the conclusion is that without any restrictions on the growth of the blockchain, there will come a point where the network can no longer accept new nodes because it would take the new node too long to download the whole chain.
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:01:25
now turn this into an article and post in r/technology
@_date: 2015-04-25 20:03:17

@_date: 2015-10-31 19:45:39
but it would be simple; disable user's access without renewal, have them load up the balance to OVER what 1 month costs so they can auto-renew    
OR just use wallet like coinbase which can auto deduct
@_date: 2016-05-24 14:54:51
in the title I meant Converging

credit card system is outdate because anyoen can try to charge it just by getting your number
pre-authorization is the way to go and only takes one simple layer on top of bitcoin and thats only IF they choose not to add that into bitcoin wallets in an upcoming release

seems short term wrong from what he said (how fast it was going to rise right after his video); but we did not break that 688 yet
@_date: 2016-07-29 23:14:33
someone should buy that from him on a day it is 668
@_date: 2016-07-31 20:28:56
fuck I shoulda saw it
@_date: 2016-07-15 06:49:45

@_date: 2016-07-28 06:02:38
he's about to retire? - we're trying to best set the course for our country at this critical juncture
@_date: 2016-07-23 23:32:20
