There will only ever be a total of 21 million bitcoins, being able to split them up smaller does not affect this.

this shit is bananas, b-a-n-a-n-a-s
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:32:53
It is, just because the coins can be split into smaller increments doesnt mean its not finite

We have gone up 25% today, this is fast no matter how you spin it

Surely they wouldn't keep all their bitcoin on one account either?

Your logic is sound actually. However changing it in this way is fine as everyone proportionally keeps their share unlike printing money. Btw i wasnt downvoting u, must have been someone else

The exchange acts as a middleman. You are buying it from the exchange which has bought the bitcoin from someone selling it

To be fair bitcoin is grower faster even after takinv into account exponential growth

The number of decimal places can increase
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:17:40
there has been corrections though, from 7800 to 5500, from 11000 to 8500

Why is the US Dollar not just a useless piece a paper? Its because people believe that they will be able to exchange it for goods. Its the same with bitcoin, the reason it has value is cause people believe it has value.

Well if banks can upgrade I don't see why bitcoin can't either.

Look at how many times bitcoin has crashed and recovered, dips of 25% are regular

We will have much more pressing matters if quantum computers can crack the crypto, considering its the system that all the banks use.
