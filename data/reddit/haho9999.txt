 My apologies, I don't think I should have used the word anonymous.  A better word to use would have been "hidden".  I was, possibly mistakenly, under the impression that you somehow remain hidden from the network until you spend transactions from an address, which is why I am looking for an explanation for the apparent contradiction for the blockchain showing the record of a received transaction for a first time use of an offline bitcoin address.

@_date: 2014-02-19 00:50:39
Okay, so I think I've got it.....  Does this explanation work?
Just before you read this, note when I use public KEY and public ADDRESS and they are not to be confused with private key.
So I've just learned that the public key is different from the public address.  The public address, which starts with the number 1 and is what our QR codes represent, is actually the hash or encrypted representation of the public key which is a massively long number we don't need to worry ourselves about. This is is obviously a simplification and I am not talking about the private key here.
When it comes to generating offline key pairs or cold storage wallets, or whatever we want to call them, it's good to understand how they work for our security.  
When I create an offline wallet I can send bitcoins to that wallet as many times as I want and the public key will never be 'broadcast' to the network.  There is however a public record of those transactions placed on the blockchain which allows anyone to monitor the public address (starting with the number 1) and all transactions that have occurred, including current balance.
Now when I spend from that address for the first time the public key is now broadcast to the network for the first time.  This means that if the creation of that address was done insecurely, then people might be able to crack the private key and take the money.
So what this tells me is that even if we have used poor technique to create our offline addresses such as low entropy or whatever then as long as you spend all the bitcoins at once the first time you make a spend then you should be safe.   
In summary, hackers can't crack a public address but can crack an insecure public key to reveal the private key and ideally, cold wallets should be a once only withdrawal to empty the wallet entirely.

A question from and ActM shareholder to CT....
Q:  "Neotrix can you tell us if you are in a similar situation to Gox now.  It seems a little alike."  
A:  "Our problem isn't related to this.
Well since our last addition of servers a glitch appeared in our trading engine. One/multi users noticed it, created multiple accounts and withdrawed USD only (as the bug was related to USD only...). He/They used OKpay account verified to withdraw so our lawers will get in touch OKPAY to try to get more info on identity of users as hack or theft using a glitch are not allowed by most countries and we have proof of what happened. SO the both good news are we can afford for this losse while we can track hackers...
As quoted we will reopen in around 24 hours and let people withdraw all their coins and currencies in manual mode (so we can check each withdrawal and delete some abuse users we didnt noticed yet). Then will come the time for a new stucture/software for CT, to come back soon and reach the best.
PS : We will issue a dividend for the downtime in order to also avoid any losts to our precious shareholders.
Regards, Neotrix"

I've heard from a few sources that you remain anonymous to the network until you actually SPEND bitcoins if you are using a newly created offline address.

This is all very confusing.

If I mined those btc are they considered taxable income?  If I made 90% of those btc by owning shares in a mining company is that considered taxable income?  Any attempt to answer these questions would be very appreciated as my long term strategy is indeed to move to Germany in a few years time if I need to.

With all the speculation at the moment and bubble opinions, it surprises me that no-one has mentioned the role that mtGox played in the bursting of the last bubble.

@_date: 2013-12-19 03:40:45
The difficulty increasing or decreasing allows for the creation of bitcoins to occur at preset time intervals.  This is why we know the date the last bitcoin will be mined.  If the difficulty remains constant while the global hash rate changes, there is no control over the frequency of bitcoins being generated.

I'd say for a layperson watching an interview such as this, there is an awful lot of information to take in at once.  I see no problem with spokespeople leaving out some of the finer details.  If people want to learn more, they will research it themselves and soon discover mBTC and satoshis, etc.  There is always a danger when we try to explain Bitcoin that people will switch off due to information overload and thankfully while this interview mentions a ledger, it doesn't attempt to explain the blockchain!  Good interview.

Take a punt on Altcoins.  Chose one that you'll be able to mine lots and lost every day.  One day, if your lucky you will have backed the right horse and may make a killing.  You can even alternate so mine one alt coin one week then another the next.
