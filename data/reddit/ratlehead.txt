What if the math is flawed

Best of luck. Only thing you can call precious is something you can hug.

You are all winners here. So far I have forcefully ignored BTC. 100$ was too expensive to buy in. Then 300, 600. 2000 was laughable. Now I am about to enter at 12k. Wish me luck.

But but but ... the dept is in dollars - a toy money in few years.

For fucking what are you going to use bc blockchain?

I know, it is hard not to feel jellow. I am slowly getting used to never owning a lambo though - it's tough.
But why the whole thing is still BS is the fact that the great engineer, Satoshi, didn't anticipate this kind of sick mining industry to exists behind Bitcoin. The formula was to simulate money printing in foreseeable manner, but it was never intended to be a vehicle of becoming rich. Now so much energy is waisted on this - it is so much more stupid then printing the Fiat money. It's very funny though. I'm sure we can think of something even more stupid, but it's very hard. At least to have it even worse for our planet.
I am sure there are many more aspects that do not work now as intended when Bitcoin was designed back then. It works - but it works wrongly. It's design error. Broken product. We should replace it with a fixed solution.

The whole Bitcoin is laughable. People getting millionaires by mining - now that's a real work.
