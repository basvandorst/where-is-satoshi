There is a new one in town for Desktop: 
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:17:11
**10% OFF with coupon code REDDITOR**
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:20:30
I built Moonitor with Blockfolio issue in mind!
- Server issue? the app uses exchange API, less chance of getting not updated data.
- Refresh button? Everything refresh itself thanks.
I hope you can try the app once you are home. I would love to hear some feedback from someone who knew Blockfolio issues.
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:09:10
Thank you, much appreciated! Have you tried the app?
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:01:06
Website was working great when posting. I didn't know that was going to trash honestly.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:26:05
Glad you like the name, thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:00:32
So now it work, I was using a 2fa wallet and there are not compatible with it. Restoring a new standard wallet with the xprv solved it ��
I'm reactivating the plugin, looks like the best option for WooCommerce when you configure it right! And support is awesome!
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:27:46
ahah yes, got hit hard!
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:18:59
You could go on the people profile who talk about the app, a little check that they are legit account. I'm not that familiar with reddit, pretty new to it though.
You could also try it in a VM and check if it does something weird?
I just found out about this: 
I'll do the necessary step, and see if that could help.
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:15:01
thank you man!
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:14:08
I guess it's really fun to code. Never had that much fun before on a project. Data and API are out there to play with!
Did I tell you that it was fun?
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:33:19
Ahahah, what if I rename it Bcash for real? :D
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:33:40
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:32:38
Yes, got a temporary cache for now.
I'll look into a better solution for the future. Have you tried redis?
You only recommend varnish?
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:30:43
thank you man!
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:14:10
Yes a bit! But it wasn't intended. I just draw the moon and a rocket xD
He got the message! He kept his seriousness, but his tail betrayed him.
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:10:51
I can relate to that except the watercooled computer, lucky you!
*...makes 56k noise while leaving...*
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:55:47
Coding with tons of emotions, got the rise and the fall ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:40:43
You should do it, it's really fun to work on those datas!
For the graph I've used G2, but I might switch to D3 maybe. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:59:55
Ah, cats... ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:39:44
Thank you for letting me know! I'll investigate this.
You can reload the windows, or quit/relaunch... and it should be ok
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:50:27
Food is more important than relationship for any living being ��
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:46:34
ahah, sounds good or bad though? 
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:59:52
Thank you for your feedback!
Those are a lot of good ideas! Especially the import from blockchain address. But I can imagine that it need to implement for each currency at a time... and only the best one.
Anyways I'll note those ideas, be sure it didn't go to the trash :P
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:14:44
Hey! looks good but I'm not fan of their UI/UX, too much mobile target in my opinion
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:14:12
Yes please, and do a screenshot if you see something next time.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:07:42
The app is for sale, I'm much sure it should have a donate button.
Could explain why? or elaborate?
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:37:02
Sir, all dogs are trustworthy :P
edit: Yes, server is getting slow, doing my best :(
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:23:50
I'm from the Moon, let's be friend.
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:26:44
Thank you. Right now no, tell me more about your use case though, I'm curious. You want something like separating portfolio from 2 different exchange?
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:18:10
Yes, manually it will be possible.
In the Application support folder, you'll have a file moonitor.db, just rename it to moonitor-backup.db for example, relaunch the app and a new moonitor.db will be created. When having multiple .db files,  you can rename the one you want to manage to moonitor.db, and launch the app.
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:23:16
The website or the app?
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:25:41
I will check it out. I've been content with DO too, but I never got reddit traffic!
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:07:24
I'm finding hard to believe because I made it.
I would really love some screenshot of this :)
For those who are afraid: You can install a VM and try it out. Check out also the Outgoing Network connection.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:46:58
YES! 
But I don't talk about my 4 months dog mentoring...
PS: Not 16 was more like "more than 16"
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:04:42
Thank you very much for the kind words! (I'm sure at the end I must sound like a robot thanking others ahah)
Nice tip for the QuadrigaCX, I didn't Canadian was that much into crypto. Good to know :) Exchange duly noted! I'll check their API
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:21:30
*can't compute question*
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:52:02
Thank you for trying! Let me know if something's not working, or if you think that something is missing :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:33:36
Neat! Let me know if you found any bug or if you feel that something is missing :)
I'm made the app with Electron and VueJS. Website is host at digitalocean on WP/WooCommerce.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:54:24
I've update the license activation's limit to 3 devices in version 0.3.1!
User will be able to manage their activation from the website soon ��
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:28:00
Hey! If you have some time, care to do a little video about it?
That will help me to debug it.
Thank you very much for the support! Have a wonderful Sunday!
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:06:36
For now yes, sorry about that! I'm not using USD either, I'll be adding more FIAT soon enough.
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:37:03
*init auto-destruction*
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:22:40
Good question. I was feeling like so on the moment, right now I don't know why honestly ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:11:40
I knew about cows/cattle after registering the domain name... ��
But there is a meaning to it in crypto: When a coin is raising value, people says it's going "to the Moon". Thus **Moon**itor
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:13:03
Thank you very much for the support!
Have you seen other bug than the one with add coin?
I'll spent the day tomorrow fixing what people reported to me.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:01:22
I'll do my best for the next update 
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:58:09
Great, thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:04:16
Yes, got killed by reddit. Sorry about that :(
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:05:17
The app works fine. The website though is slow as heck when having some traffic.
I'm using Digitalocean right now, wordpress + nginx on  2cpu + 2gb ram :/
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:52:43
I had 16 in 2000, that counts?
edit: wow that makes me travel far. I was doing shit php and html "coding" back then ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:36:37
I thought than my FastCGI cache on nginx was enabled, but nope and enable it crashed the server too.
I've hardly install W3 Total Cache, and that saved the WordPress from crashing. I had a $10 droplet at DO too, I've upgrade it to the $20 for now. Temporarily it's fixed, but I'll look into a better solution.
I didn't went right now with Cloudfront because of the DNS change, but if my crash was related to WordPress, can Cloudfront help WP in traffic spike?
About the choice of WP, it's because I was familiar with it (I'm a web dev), and I needed something free working out the box for the shop. I had to spend more time developing the app, than spending it on the website.
Sorry for the quick answer, but I'm a bit in a hurry right now. I have tons of things to do IRL too ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:45:42
Yes, that could be nice!
I'll check on the API if I can get that info.
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:25:07
I've used Bittrex and Binance for now
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:22:21
Should work fine now?
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:32:33
Oh yeah... especially this one!
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:01:57
Thank you for the kind words! :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:35:28
YES PLEASE!
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:34:22
But Sir? I don't want my mail readable by spam bot?
Contact page mean you can contact from there, thus the form ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:51:01
Gotcha! Thank you very much for your comment. 
When I said deactivation, it was more "reactivation of an unused device.
I'm not really business centric, but for sure I'll do my best to put user first. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:27:59
If you mean exchange api key, no.
You need to enter manually your coins, the UI was made to be fast and easy (there is a know bug with add bags or add coins button, I'm going to fix this today)
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:54:03
At digitalocean, but my mistake was that there was no cache on the WP. So reddit killed it each time I reboot it. Now it's temporarily fixed, fingers crossed!
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:15:39
I'm using candlestick data from exchange.
For example at Bittrex: 
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:51:23
Yes, sorry about that. Server is going down, working on it :(
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:45:16
That's because it's a new app. I'll be putting it on Windows Store and AppStore soon. That will solve that issue!
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:20:09
You are right! I should update them once in a while.
Thank you for the tip!
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:54:06
I've update the license activation's limit to 3 devices in version 0.3.1!
User will be able to manage their activation from the website soon ��
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:25:09
Yes, that could be a solution. I'm not that familiar with Software and Crowdfunding though, are you? Do you which platform people goes to when it comes to software?
Thank you for the advice
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:40:39
Moo-nitor Moon-itor, almost the same thing :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:30:58
What? Is it shitty because you tried it? (I don't think so)
You know, I'm tired of seeing ICO spam everywhere, but I ignore them. Just do the same for my app please. There is a lot of work behind this project. Point me to an App that save the users' data on his device instead of a cloud server?
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:44:36
the node_modules hell ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:02:05
I'm not your friend, buddy.
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:21:49
what's tick by tick?
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:30:05
Unfortunately yes
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:53:09
Is that a thing? 
edit: Yes, found it. WHAT? xD
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:33:00
Moon-itor I guess :P
See  to know why
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:07:31
Noted! :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:55:52
Thank you! 
I'll check their API and see what they can offer me :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:10:52
Awesome! I would love to know what you thing is missing or doesn't feel right.
Yes, it's made with Electron (and VueJS)
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:37:39
alright :(
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:39:38
I've used Electron and VueJS, first time for me to build an app with Javascript!
@_date: 2018-02-16 11:31:01
I would be worry too tbh, but trust me... should be a crash but nothing else.
Windows version? Moonitor version 0.3.1? And it failed while installing?
Are you able to get a error log from windows or something?
Sorry about the crash and that it scares you!
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:11:49
Yes, you can still use the demo, it no limited in time but in features.
Max currency to follow is 5. And you can track 2 transactions per currency. A "demo" message will appear after 10min of use too.
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:40:41
Not really, at the beginning it was just an app for me on desktop (didn't find a decent one for my needs) and learning more VueJS tricks (I'm a web dev), but I kept adding features and I thought that I had a usable product.
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:18:32
Will do! Thank you :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:26:11
Thank you! Hard or not, I'll try :P
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:09:53
*mission aborted*
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:17:32
Thank you for your constructive comment. It Helps a lot!
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:45:38
Thank you
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:02:41
Ok, thank you for the advice.
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:22:09
REALLY? :D
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:07:30
thx for letting me know, I'll fix this asap
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:21:29
Thank you very much nazim!
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:36:58
Wasn't aware of it, I must be welcome there then.
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:19:04
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:48:24
I just did a better thing I think. I've put my LinkedIn profile on the website. Anyone can put any mail, but I'm putting my career reputation out there :)
@_date: 2018-02-20 18:54:39
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:37:22
Thank you! Have a good one
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:45:16
That's really weird and I'm pretty sure it's not related to my app. From this thread you are the only one having this.
Do you  have another machine that you could try?
Do you how to try it in VM?
The apple discussion thread point out to different software to clean it up, did you tried that?
I'm really curious about your case man :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:21:36
thx :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:28:40
Yes, I'll be changing that soon.
Activation/Deactivation sounds like something to consider too.
Thank you for your feedback!
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:51:27
Thank you! 
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:51:51
None Sir, it's pretty cheap for a desktop App. it's just 12.90€!!
Joke aside: None.
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:50:50
No need to be pissed man, relax and use whatever makes you happy.
Enjoy your day too.
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:45:21
Thank you very much for your detailed feedback! And you are totally right, I rethinking about the licensing model to make it more open for most users. When listening and talking to other user, I was thinking putting a limit of 3 activation for the license key, and also adding a way for the user to manage his activations from the website.
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:08:16
thank you sir!
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:52:35
Thank you! I bought a WordPress theme at themeforest for the layout. I've just put my assets, I needed to spend more time on the app than the website.
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:03:53
More like... I'm older
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:27:10
Hey man thank you! Sure thing, I've already added a "Bitcoin and altcoin" option on the checkout page. Did you miss it? Oo it doesn't appear for you?
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:48:12
It's a server at DigitalOcean, but I've never experienced that kind of traffic before on it.
Now it should be ok, I'll be looking more into next time I want to post something on reddit ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:10:05
I wasn't familiar with it and I already had a server with DO (basic, needed to upgrade it)
It's only for the website though, the app works without my server.
But I'm curious about EC2, I'll check it out. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:39:54
Yes, I have this noted on my todo/wanted feature list!
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:28:27
Next yet, but it will be my next top priority for sure ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:34:26
Thank you for letting me know! How do you say WP to cache the homepage? I'll look into the CORS if I can avoid that too.
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:24:24
Some that I could think right now:
- Data are saved on your device and not at a third party server.
- A direct real-time data directly from the exchange API with websocket.
- You don't give your data to a free app company that makes money from selling your info.
- A Cross platform tracker (Mac, Win, Linux)
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:08:37
Thanks! If you find things you don't like, you can report them here, I'll check what I can improve!
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:41:00
I've been wanting to add more info on each currency, I'll see what I can do about this
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:32:31
lol thank you sir :)
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:14:39
That could be something I can try to add to the graph, but I need to give a try before promising this.
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:29:09
Meet Kuma.
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:39:35
WTF with the guy's clap behind him?
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:56:47
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:00:04
I’m on my phone right now, I can’t look for the installation path. But if you search for “Moonitor” folder, you can find it. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:09:22
Really sorry about the issue! First time im seeing this :/
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:25:50
It's not Hardware locked right now, no worry I don't like either.
Right now, user can contact me and I'll reset the activation key.
That said you're right, I'll up the number of device for one license. Not the first time I get comment about this. This is my first app, so I don't have much experience in business model. I'll work on that!
If that was 3 devices / license, would you be ok with that app?
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:35:46
Oh sorry about that, I didn't have the chance to test it on a bigger resolution! I understand the issue with fixed window size now.
I can't promise to fix this asap, as I need hardware, but it's on my todo/fix list
Thank you for your comment!
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:58:13
Thank you!
I could try to add that, could be useful for more people :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:46:55
Yes, getting CPU 100%, trying to fix this right now :/
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:08:38
I'll be fixing that tomorrow I hope. Might be a bug :/
After second launch do you have the bug?
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:37:56
Glad I could help! :)
THank you for trying out
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:37:35
Ok, I think I found it into W3 Total Cache, will try it.
edit: Configuring it on W3 doesn't change a thing. I'll try directly with nginx tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:46:41
Sure thing. It's not for everyone.
But for myself, I hate doing repetitive thing when it come to check price and calculate estimates value of the portfolio. Especially if you have a lots of different currency.
It help me having a global overview of my portfolio on desktop.
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:30:56
Thank you! I'm not sure I understood you well. Like 20 LTC without its buy value?
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:09:24
thank you for reporting! What make it difficult for you? Do you have in mind a better way?
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:03:34
Hey! Yes Electron and VueJS was the best mix I got in a project! Really worth it. For now there is no source code available, sorry about that.
But if you need some guidance, I'd be happy to help :)
@_date: 2018-02-15 01:21:09
Got it! (not really, I'll google that)
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:23:40
Thank you for trying it!
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:42:45
what? who said that?
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:06:56
One step at a time, mobile will come after. I had an interest in learning to build a Desktop app, that's one of the reason
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:53:24
I've update the license activation's limit to 3 devices in version 0.3.1!
User will be able to delete one activation from the website soon ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:59:19
But a pretty good bot right? ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:37:03
Yes, that would be better for everyone. Anyway, you can follow  on twitter... as soon as it will be available from Window/App Store, I'll spread the words there first :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:58:14
 Some unrelated reason:
- Wanted a desktop app for my self
- Wanted to learn Electron  and more VueJS
But I would love to do a mobile version soon.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:17:53
What OS are you using?
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:46:30
Too bad the UX is not what you are looking for. What platform are you using? What stuff you don't like about it?
What window can't you close? The main one or the modal? (Think of it like a mini webapp)
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:08:49
Oh ok, thank you for the heads up. I'll add it on my idea list and see if I can implement it
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:52:31
Thank you, I'll looking into it.
Just to let you guys know, the App work without my server.
What was slow and crashed was the WordPress, caching it solve temporarily. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:56:20
TBH I would prefer less traffic, and more people trying the app :(
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:59:21
For sure. That's something I'll be changing too, I'l might raise the number of devices to 3 for 1 license. You can follow us on twitter to stay updated :)
API read-only feature is on my todo list, but not something easy to do... one day!
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:36:38
Yes, soon enough it will be there :)
When I started working with Electron, I didn't know some developer didn't like it :/
@_date: 2018-02-16 10:20:49
I see. Nop sorry, it doesn't have it and I wasn't aware of that kind of graph.
Why do prefer to see this over candlestick? (sorry if dumb question, always learning ��)
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:28:55
Here you go: 
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:49:31
I didn't have the default settings, but the server block wasn't really properly configured tbh. If I'm have some doubt, I'll reach you out then, thank you! :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:10:31
Damn! Thank you for reporting. I'll disable it right now.
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:10:00
I saw what you did there :P
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:05:08
Yes that's definitely an odd bug, I was thinking maybe it doesn't like Windows 7.
I'll try that on a VM this week-end, I'll keep you updated.
If you make a shortcut of the .exe yourself, does it work?
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:04:01
Noted for the exchange!
I would love doing it for iOS! I should do a kickstarter for mobile version maybe? :P
@_date: 2018-02-16 13:53:24
Ah yes I understand, I'll improve the filter.
About Bitcoin Cash, I don't why it's BCC on bittrex and binance while seeing BCH around.
I don't process anything on the market name, I got it like this from the exchange directly. I wanted to add more info about the currency soon, I'll investigate what's going on with BCC/BCH and see what I can do.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:03:40
I've use Javascript and VueJS. Packed in Electron.
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:44:20
No, unfortunately I don't have access to those data with the exchange API
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:02:12
Give us a screenshot please. I find this hard to believe. Adobe? o_O
Are you using Adobe on your computer though?
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:22:36
Thank you for the tips and kind word! For sure it's helping, we'll say how it goes
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:27:11
No it's not. For the trust I'll be putting the app in the AppStore and Windows Store soon... but it's not free and I don't have budget for this for the moment
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:46:44
Is that the same story than the 16 year old girl who had "mentors" commited code for her?  I didn't know there was a prize at the end xD
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:31:49
Not too much but my server is keeping crashing when i get like 50 visitors... I've upgraded it but still... working on it right now :(
You need to be lucky right now to get a page, sorry about that :(
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:10:05
Thank you! Right now it has currencies from Bittrex and Binance.
Once I'm happy with the app, I'll add more exchanges :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:22:28
Do you mind making a little video about it?
I'll try to replicate this, but I'm not sure I understood each step:
What do you mean by `exit add amount`?
Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:43:09
Meme or not, that doesn't exclude the hard work behind right?
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:25:27
Ahahah, let me know if they are coming my way :P
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:11:57
Thank you! 
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:55:21
I've update the license activation's limit to 3 devices in version 0.3.1!
User will be able to manage their activation from the website soon ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:43:28
Will be adding more FIAT currency for the estimate value.
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:12:51
Nice! I solve the issue with w3. I'll totally look into ElasticBeanstalk now. Thank you Sir!

@_date: 2018-02-14 13:43:59
Great idea, thank you very much!
The cached version has the version 0.2.2 version linked though. Latest version is 0.3.0.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:26:12
Thank you! I've built it with Electron and VueJS.
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:28:11
What do you mean? It's compatible Mac, Windows and Linux.
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:12:12

@_date: 2018-02-14 13:46:43
I don't want one license to be use everywhere. Or someone buying the license and giving the key to his friends for example.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:54:40
I've update the license activation's limit to 3 devices in version 0.3.1!
User will be able to manage their activation from the website soon ��
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:58:49
It always got me
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:24:20
One license is limited to one device. Only way I find to protect myself against hackers
@_date: 2018-02-17 11:33:23
I've added your plugin to my site, configure it with my Electrum wallet and the xpub. I've made a sell and never got the money in my Wallet... but I can the transaction on your website.
That's a shame, the plugin looks promising without issue like this. Or at least... Write it clearly on your website to explain the merchant what he'd expect.
Care to explain what is going on? Thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:43:36
Oh, yes you can already do that!
I've tried this with some coin I've mined with 0 in the "Trade Price". You'll get its current value, and the profit percentage will show +Infinity%.
You can it in the demo, let me know!
@_date: 2018-02-14 18:41:44
It was stressful as hell to fix it xD
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:08:52
Ok, that is a big problem lol.
Honestly, I have no idea why. The installation for windows may be broken. Let me get back home and rebuild it (in an hour or so)
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:11:39
Really good. I've tried React before, and VueJS just make sense where react often doesn't (I come from Vanilla JS &amp; jQuery)
@_date: 2018-02-14 12:50:28
Yes! with VueJS :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:27:57
thank you lol
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:28:56
He got bad influence from human :(
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:46:04
Thank you! got back home now, I'll check the chat :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:59:16
thank you man! I was wondering the same thing, it was too good to be true
@_date: 2018-02-15 09:59:56
Thank you Obie! much appreciated
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:24:46
That's because of Electron and node_modules :/
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:43:44
lol, you should use it too if you buy it:P
@_date: 2018-02-14 21:20:42
The App talk directly with exchanges API (bittrex and binance for now), without my server in the middle. What made you said that?
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:26:24
Because I can.
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:54:58
I've update the license activation's limit to 3 devices in version 0.3.1!

@_date: 2018-02-15 15:27:19
Thank you for your comment! For the website I've bought a theme for the layout, I just put my design over. Went tweaking around with WooCommerce to manage licenses sale and that's it.
By payment page you mean the checkout page? I'll check it thank you!
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:09:17
Thank you! Glad you love it, spent way too much polishing each pixel :P
@_date: 2018-02-15 10:26:16
Looks like you had Acrobat before then?
It point to */Library/Application Support/Adobe/* folder, and my app use */Library/Application Support/Moonitor/* folder.
Can you assure that you never get the Adobe update window when not having Moonitor? The weird part is that the Mac version is not a pkg installer, it's an directly an .app
@_date: 2018-02-14 19:13:37
Thank you for the recommendation. First eCommerce website, still learning. I'll check those foreign currencies.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:02:50
No release date yet, I don't have budget right now. But this is something I truly want!
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:47:58
Yes, weird coincidence there!


I feel you, I would have react the same!
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:48:59
Right now you can put the tradePrice to 0, and the quantity of mined coin. It will give you its actual value, and the percentage profit will be shown as +Infinity%, you'll know that those are mined coins. Let me know if that could help?
I could add an option "mined" later along with buy/sell when adding a transaction. I'll think about it, thank you for your comment :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:11:30
Thank you very much for the purchase! I'm really glad you like.
Didn't get any bug with the add coin or add transaction button? I've been getting comment about this. 
I'll be adding more exchange soon, and they Bitfinex was on my top list, and they seems to have the coin! :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:36:01
Thank you for your comment! I know there is always some users more paranoid out there. I'm one myself.
Would you trust it more if it was on Windows Store or App store?
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:53:47
I've update the license activation's limit to 3 devices in version 0.3.1!

No one is making fun of 16 years old designers. I'm just not... 16 ��
Check out this tweet from Feb 6th encouraging the 16 years old designer: 
@_date: 2018-02-15 16:12:30
Great, let me know what you think after trying it
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:43:24
he slurps your face intensely for that! (I would wash that face later...)
@_date: 2018-03-25 18:54:33
You have a free trial. API key is only in the paid app.
And bitfinex (and other exchanges will be added soon)
@_date: 2018-02-14 22:49:53
I never said I was an innovator buddy. And what are you? An innovator? Good for you then. Do you also work for free?
Copy cat? Looks like you know shit about development and UI/UX... :)
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:41:14
Good thing that I didn't code the WordPress theme then if it's inefficient code.
The app is not related to my server. The app will still works if my server goes down because it uses the markets exchange API.
What didn't work was that there was no caching activated (my bad), and it wasn't ready to ready reddit traffic.

There is a French documentary from 2007 called “suck my geek”, and magicaltux aka Mark is featured in it talking about what he was doing back then (if I recall, he was mentioning IRC)
@_date: 2018-04-04 11:54:26
As an engineer at heart, what would you wish to work on or build right now, instead of going through all the mess around mtgox?
