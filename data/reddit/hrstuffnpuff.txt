Check out the Trezor Reddit forum, I had the same issue.  Try the local bitcoins server.
You are right to be cautious, I am reading about some fishing and scam sites targeting Trezor.  Make sur it's the right website.  Mytrezor.com 
Also, Trezor works well with electrum as an alternative to the website.  pretty seamless.

Well we were looking for mainstream coverage.  I am not sure that was the type we wanted though.  Should we call the NYT guy an idiot for not paying triple the old fee?

what you are feeling is known as the "wall of worry" in the stock market.

Well as i said above, the marketplace is providing users with an option.  If users think that option is worse than their other alternatives it will go unused, those miners will eventually abandon that path.  If users think it is a better alternative then their other choices they will use it.  how is that not how bitcoin was supposed to work?
@_date: 2016-06-30 13:46:30
Sounds like Bitcoin is working as designed.  The marketplace is providing users with options.  This should be interesting.

I am not sure but the proposal posted on 8BTC has not been shot down or denied by any of the Chinese mining pools.
It will be interesting to see what happens.

Well first, you say there is no record.
What about the block chain.  Just use the transaction records of the coins moving.  That is your proof of sale.
@_date: 2016-06-28 19:49:43
What about Volabit.com?
I dont know much about them but they claim to provide that service.

Capital gains are due if you sell them in the same month or hour or minute, the difference in purchase price and sales price triggers the capital gains not the timing.  If they are sold in the same year the capital gains are "short term" and taxed as regular income.
@_date: 2016-11-15 20:18:56
The correct answer is that if you bartered it you would use the market price on sale date for the value of the BTC.  
Yes, if the price has not moved much and the value difference is not significant there isnt going to be any problems.  
You would still want to report it on your taxes on the same schedule as you report stock trades and commodity trades.  BTC are treated as a commodity.  The net gains would be zero or close to zero and therefore not much if any tax.
The issue is that as the OP pointed out if you dont report these sale transactions on your taxes at the time when the price is insignificant can the IRS later come back when the price difference is huge and ask for proof etc.  
I dont really know the answer to this question.  
If you really did sell it in the same month for no capital gain and the IRS cant point to any unreported income or gain later on that came from those coins what is the problem?
I am not sure.
@_date: 2016-11-15 20:22:16
I am not sure you have to prove it wasnt to yourself.  Prove it was?  
I think a lot of this is new ground for the IRS and is still being decided.

'selling anytime soon' is relative to the price.  People aren't stupid and they react.  If the price moves up more people will sell.  If it moves up tenfold a lot more people will sell.

So everyone agrees, pretense and misdirection were used to achieve the objective of the people in control.  Every post just makes my point.  It wasn't a security breach, it was an ideological purge.  
Can we cut the doublespeak?  Can we stop the obfuscation?  Why is everyone afraid to call it what is is? 
Whether or not Gavin's access should have been revoked for one of the reasons posted I don't like being played.  I don't know shit about cryptography but I know how power plays work.  None of this is original.
Looking in through window I am having a hard time telling the difference between the humans and the pigs.
@_date: 2016-05-06 19:45:22
That is a very weak argument.  Gavin gave no indication that he was going to unilaterally give away anything.  Seems like a made up excuse to me.  
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:41:15
Yes and I saw him whispering with snowball in a suspicious manner.  I am just thankful you and Napoleon saved us from their evil plan to bring back the masters.
@_date: 2016-05-06 21:29:25
You actually just restated my point.  The "straw" by your own analogy was not sufficient to justify the action except for all that came before it.  But the straw you are trying to use is his judgement on the CW issue.  You are conflating two separate issues. I point out the obvious the original stated reason was that Gavin may have been hacked.  The straw for the people with the power may very well have been their view of his judgement.  The reason given to the sheeple was "security!" 
That was a pretense to achieve a goal of some people with the power to make the move.  Actually one of the oldest.  
Should we all thank them for saving us from Snowball?  Everyone knows he is working with the masters!  Four legs good, two legs bad!

So now we abandon the second made up excuse and move into wild speculation.
I didnt see him try to sell anybody a satoshi, i saw him state what he thought.  The rest are flimsy accusations none of which justify questioning his integrity.  Mike hearn did nothing wrong, he said what he thought and voted with his coins and sold them.  I dont agree with him but i dont question his integrity.  
I will start questioning his integrity when he gives a reason to question it, you havent provided one yet.  I dont have any special love for Gavin, i dont even know the guy.  I do know a power play when i see one.
I am not sure how to answer your second question, it seems rhetorical, if someone commits a crime would i try to justify it? perhaps you could clarify?
@_date: 2016-05-06 20:32:28
So you agree that the original reason for removing his access was a pretense?  
The specific reason for removal is not important just the end result?  We got what we wanted now lets figure out our reasoning.
Now that he is removed under false accusations he needs to justify reinstatement?
Looks like a naked power play.  
None of this is very original.  Maybe we should all start chanting "four legs good, two legs bad."

Yes, updated bridge installed.

Isn't this a problem with Bitcoin?  I.e it's not fungible.  
Until that problem is solved this will never go away.
@_date: 2016-07-13 17:47:55
that is a slippery slope argument that does not hold up.  We have been scaling up the block size since the beginning of bitcoin.   We only now have come close to a limit that was imposed when the blocks were a fraction of the size, therefor it was not a practical limit.
@_date: 2016-07-13 17:51:47
Does 'nobody' include the people in this thread saying the 1mb should never be raised?  see the post above.
If we are not proposing to keep the same limit forever lets try raising it incrementally now.
@_date: 2016-07-13 17:45:15
not to be flippant but 'lightning as the actual payment network.' is not reality today.  we do not even know if it will work at all.

You are completely off the mark.

I just went through this.
Try uninstalling the Trezor bridge and reinstalling the new updated bridge.
There is also a firmware update for the Trezor once you get the bridge updated.
Post in R/Trezor for more help.
I assume you have your seed backed up?  You should have that before doing any updates.

Thank you for the thoughtful response.  I disagree that an increase in the blocksize limit now is comparable to an increase in the 21mm limit.  Raising the blocksize is not inflationary.  
your prognostications on centralization and miners incentives are just that prognostications, i dont find them convincing.  I can similarly prognosticate that when the block reward becomes minuscule that miners will simply demand more fees to mine.  What is wrong with that?
i understand why you may be happy to price out other peoples transactions that you dont see as valuable but thats not really the issue.  At some point we will reach a limit where even transactions you favor will not have room on the blockchain.
To say i should accept the risks of waiting for an unproven software that has not been released and is several times more complex then the current system is a false choice.  I have another option, lobby the community to make incremental changes through consensus that improve the current system.  I have seen a lot of vapor ware and hyped projects that never delivered.  I dont know what lightning will deliver. 
Maybe you are correct that a majority is behind the core plan, i am not sure but that is irrelevant.  I am  proposing that we reach a consensus to change the blocksize limit.
To say i want to risk killing the currency is a true straw man argument.  if we made it a longer time for nodes to convert would make it safe enough for you?
I am not trying to antagonize anyone.  I simply am not convinced by the small block arguments.  A lot of the arguments are contrived or red herrings.  I see a lot of misdirection, conflating of issues and bad economic prognosticating.
It is an important time for bitcoin so i feel i need to speak up.

I never liked the Starbucks analogy.  i think it was a weak and confusing metaphor.
My question is why is 1 mb the right limit?
when it was instituted it was several times larger than the demand.  It has taken us years to reach full blocks.  Now we have reached an arbitrary limit and this is the maximum forever?
At this rate with no new 'layers' we will reach a point in the near future where there will not be enough room for all transaction no matter what fee they are paying.  I have seen people say that low value or unimportant transactions just wont get on the blockchain.  So in 2 years how many transaction will not be able to fit on the blockchain?  are all of those unimportant?
Of course we can implement another 'layer' like lightning or thunder.  Lightning and other projects with payment channels are very complex and unproven.  I hear you when you say there are three great teams working on it right now.  Right now it isnt working and we dont know it will work.  As an investor in Bitcoin i am supposed to agree to stake the whole future of the project on a completely new system that has never been proven in the real world?  Software that hasnt been released and hasnt been tested?      
How about sticking with our current system and incrementally raising the blocksize limit and monitoring the effects on the system and the latency issue?  If 1mb is ok, 2mb will likely be ok, if we see negative effects then we dont raise the limit again.  
With all due respect to the core developers and their programming capabilities i have not been impressed with their economic theories and prognostications.  As a commodity trader for 25 years i have heard a lot of prognostications.
