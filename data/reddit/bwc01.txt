Either that or it might stay the same.

Open Transactions solves all of this.

Maybe we need two donation addresses, one for each side?

Surely mining on p2pool.org still helps p2pool's hashrate in general, thus reducing the variance? 
Sure it's not decentralised, but they are not in any danger of having too much power and it allows miners to contribute to p2pool's power without running a full node? 
edit: that's assuming p2pool.org is running p2pool.in's software?

I am a consumer and I neither want or need protection, so when you are designing your regulatory safeguards don't forget to give me the option to opt out.


People with bank deposits had to watch as interest rates fell to zero in order to bailout those that borrowed too much, resulting in price increases and devalued bank deposits.

Looks good. My username is steve so I guess that makes my url  although I can't see where it explicitly says that?

Depends on your location / deposit options!
MtGox is still reflective of the retail prices in the UK. Check LocalBitcoins or BitBargain etc.

I don't think it's that bad a bet, it is already 16 points in profit after covering the spread. Of course anything can happen before expiry, but it's nice to be able to buy some type of insurance.

I was thinking I could use any 128 bit random seed to generate the addresses used in an online store and then have another script on an unrelated server (possibly localhost) retrieve the private keys on an as needed basis subject to permissions.
From what I see, if I give a staff member access to Electrum then they have access to every address used. I can't edit Electrum but I can a php script.
In any case, thanks for the script, I think it's going to be very useful.

If you're in London and looking to deposit between £1 - 5k then send me a message. I have funds in MtGox that I'd like to withdraw without fees. Can exchange cash for MtGox redeemable code 1-1.

Is there a function to easily get the private key from the master key and the index?
@_date: 2013-01-09 22:08:47
No problem, worth asking.
@_date: 2013-06-22 22:53:45
So if I know the Master Private Key, how can I get the private key to individual addresses generated?

What we need is for MtGox to extend trust to ripple users based on their MtGox account balance.
