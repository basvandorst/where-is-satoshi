But volatility is how you make money irrespective of if its the S &amp; P or Bitcoin, so yah volatility in bitcoin over an extended period of time is more rewarding, so there's no need to spin it. Its a take it or leave it type deal.

Bitcoin has a 50-50 chance of hitting a million and thats a cryptocurrency that has been around for 10 years. The altcoin that'll have a better return than bitcoin will be hard to pick so BTC is the better gamble considering there's only one BTC whereas with Alts, they're myriads of them which does the same thing.
@_date: 2018-09-30 19:14:55
"FAANG Stocks wouldve been a much better investment in the last few years than btc" I'm not the biggest supporter of BTC but that statement is the most retarded statement ive ever read. You try to sound intelligent but come out looking uninformed. Just say you don't like the speculative aspects on BTC and move on. Everything thing is speculative including your precious FAANG. How the hell do you have that much karma?

@_date: 2018-09-30 22:03:47
I don't own any btc, stop being presumptuous. And congratulations on your mined BTC. My point is that, even if you wont see exponential growth on BTC like you said, some of the alts pegged to it might. So yes, FAANG isn't a better option in terms of exponential growth in the shortest span of time. There's no math you use to arrive at a different result as the average person cant afford FAANG, and even if they could, how many can they afford to buy that could be life changing as thats the whole point of investing in the first place.

@_date: 2019-03-29 17:59:48
In my opinion, i think shorting something like bitcoin that has other applications to it besides being a store of value makes shorting a bit difficult. In the short run, they could call a short perfectly well but maybe they see a problem with that in the future if bitcoin gains wide adoption. Just my thought, it may not be valid but just a thought.

Legendary comment.
@_date: 2019-11-17 13:59:20
I think the idiot here is you believing that the futures are literally changing the supply of bitcoin. The true supply is there for all to see. Futures exist for virtually every commodity out there, deal with it or dont buy bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-08-16 18:37:48
And now that the price of BTC is up from the 3200 low of last year, are you attributing that to the CME futures too? Or you only want to look at the downside?

Well you can either fret and sell your bitcoins or hold on to them hoping things would turn out fine. I don't know the future so i wont even stress myself about what banks might do as i have no clue what they're planning plus trying to figure that out would only drive one crazy.
@_date: 2019-08-07 17:42:38

No one has a clue on what you're rambling about. The fact is, Libra and Gemini getting in bed together has no impact on the future of Bitcoin or its price.
@_date: 2019-10-13 16:11:00
"your purchasing power does diminish because inflation is set so people spend and not hoard"
Yes they'll spend regardless of if their purchasing power diminishes or not, the question is the cost of goods and services, those tend to rise duh. You talk about hoarding like everyone right now doesnt do that, hoarding isn't a bad thing as people wont decide not to spend on necessities because they're scared the price on their currency will skyrocket after they spend it. 
The current price of bitcoin is indicative of its CURRENT supply and demand, that needs no further explanation since you're already well versed in how economics works.
@_date: 2019-10-13 19:04:57
Yes i definitely agree. If i were to guess, i would say 20k in a year or two. Anything else would be hard to predict because it could also be 0 but my price point is 20k.

Investments just to escape currency debasement shouldn't be a thing as sound money should always maintain its value. So no, trust-fund keynes isnt right.
@_date: 2019-10-12 17:09:27
If being tech savvy is that much of an issue, couldn't you say that, that same issue should've been an issue with people now using the internet, smart phones or any other tech devices? I think you're either not giving people enough credit or you genuinely believe that the masses are just too stupid to understand the value prop of BTC(given that a lot of people in this space now were once oblivious but here they are)
Your choices of store of value assets once succombed to some of your threats in their nascent stages. 
Anyone who thinks BTC is a given is definitely delusional but the possibilities of them being 1% right is why most are here so its kinda hard to judge them on that.
10 years of being resistant to attack in nothing to trivialize considering we have better tools now to hack the network with how quick tech has advanced in just a short span of time.
People believing something is a store of value is what we all do so its not an exception when it comes to BTC as there are evidences to corroborate that(we cant pick and choose what works for our narrative just to highlight a point as people lose money in real estate, gold &amp; art as well, so does that mean it isnt a SoV?)

Not betting the house here, ive made a decent return so i'm definitely fine. But i definitely understand your point that some folks hold BTC as the gospel. Hopefully it pays off as that's what we all want in the long run, if we're right we rejoice and if wrong, we move along. Thats how life works.

I thought you were going to come up with something more substantive. Just because you buy otc and then short doesn't mean the price of BTC will go back to 3200 level. There's only so much you can short till you yourself get rekt. You talk as if longs don't exist.
@_date: 2019-10-13 17:54:27
But thats the issue though, how can you recreate a better bitcoin without having trade-offs? Again the main point here is the decentralization and security aspect. Remember there are tons of projects out there with better tps and speed than bitcoin but they lack the security and decentralization. Again anyone can try but it'll most likely fail. Remember there have been many projects trying to create this even before the existence of bitcoin they all failed because they had a centralized component to theirs.

Okay if you say so. I was btw referencing DCA in relation to BTC, it’s a better strategy than lump sum. If you did a lump sum at the start of a bear market and do the same with DCA relating to BTC, it’s quite easy to figure out which would do better.
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:00:40
BTC as a currency will happen but people need to come to terms with the fact that it wont happen NOW. No responsible merchant who isn't an ardent believer of BTC will be crazy enough to accept and KEEP their balances in BTC right now. Plus if 1 in 150 people walk into my store demanding to buy goods in BTC, i wont fret losing them as a customer as that ratio is fine with me. Now if ration is 1:2 then that implies that enough people now hold balances in BTC so it makes more sense. We're not at that stage yet even though some folks are trying to force the issue..kinda reminds me of the government.

The Brazilian Real you talked about, did a government create this Real or was it brought about by the free market system like Bitcoin was? And if it was government created, do we know the total supply of the Real? I'm guessing not. You cant compare the two as one is government enforced so yah all stores would automatically accept it. You just created a false equivalence to make a point that's not there. Again its SoV, MoE &amp; UoA. You cant skip true monetary process.

I don’t think the average person actually thought they needed the internet in its inception. It was one of those inventions that you realized you needed by accident as the world was operating relatively fine without it. Plus no one had any idea that the internet would be as ubiquitous as it is today. The same could be said for Bitcoin.
The bug found wasn’t an attack per se, it was found in a block so it didn’t make it to the circulating supply plus it only makes sense that bugs would be found early on as it was/still is in its test phase.
I beg to differ on the point of telling people who bought at 15k if it’s a SoV. If you DCA which is a general investing principle, you would still be up right now over time rather than betting the house using a lump sum. Nothing goes from 0 to SoV without volatility, you should know that as you definitely seem like a sensible/rational person.
Gold doesn’t have massive swings as it’s probably the most liquid asset there is. Again liquidity diminishes volatility over time. Houses were meant to be lived in and not speculated on, the result of which is making the cost of living skyrocket in certain areas all thanks to inflation.
I respect your decision to call it dumb. It’s a free world.

If i have no choice in how the monetary policy works then that means you have no control over your money, it has nothing to do with geography.
If we can both agree that BTC is still a test, i'm just surprised as to how you expect it to be full fledged without hiccups. Criticisms are warranted but wanting it to be where YOU want it to be after 10 years is ridiculous considering it takes centralized companies multiple decades to reach finality in a market. 
It seems to me, you aren't using nuance as you just expect everything to hit the ground running which makes me question if you understand how slow things work when decentralization is involved and this isnt just a phenomenon with bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-22 15:07:36
We’re talking about truly revolutionary concepts not things we thought would be certain by a landslide but werent. Things like electricity, phones, steam engines, cars, internet, they all solved something that we can’t do without. Bitcoin is no different as there has never been an alternate form of money outside of central control.
@_date: 2019-10-11 19:58:48
I agree that one shouldn't be taxed twice. On your scaling point, some would argue that if it is meant to be used as a day to day currency then scaling is imperative BUT as a store of value, it doesn't. Again it comes down to subjectivity on how you view bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-13 13:14:35
No one knew they needed the internet was my point NOT they knew before hand they needed it like food, water &amp; shelter as you cant clamor for what you don't know you needed.  
The government cant physically prevent me from watching a specific channel, listening to a specific music, getting as much credit cards as i want etc because i have full control over those things..money shouldn't be any different is the main reason why BTC is needed. We get all types of insurances, fire, home, car, life insurances in the case that when something unexpected occurs, we are well prepared to handle them. 
I never said bugs cant exist, again re-read my comment.
Everything is risky, your level of risk is what everyone should account for, and make your bets accordingly.
When one makes an investment in whatever market, you're doing so in hopes that it increases in value as no one knows if it would work or not..Bitcoin is no different, i'm really surprised you're missing this.
Again you saying there isnt new money coming into the market is disingenuous at best considering the number of subscribers to reddit is increasing, wallet creation is increasing, hash rate is increasing, institutional awareness etc. 
Again i respect your right to healthy skepticism but some of your points are very embellished. I thought we were having a rational/factual conversation.

If Gold is solely meant to be money &amp; currency as you stated, Gold shouldn't be used outside of those contexts. And if it used outside of those context, thats actually a damper on its monetary properties. The price of BTC cant stabilize where it is now as it's still going through the money evolutionary process. Why do people always think that BTC was originally intended to be used as day to day cash? How does that even make any sense?
@_date: 2019-10-13 15:33:47
Agreed, Its a tiny market but i disagree on the part where you say its not spreading as that's subjective not factual. I just read that article. Just to invalidate their summaries, in essence they're comparing BTC with other payment systems like Visa, Mastercard(which btw it took them over 90 years to reach mass adoption) 
Bitcoin can't compete with Visa or Mastercard as its not payment rail just like Visa or Mastercard arent stores of value but they help facilitate the transfer of value and they're also not a final settlement layer as well. 
Plus the article does a good job summarizing the fact that it's NEW and most likely here to stay, so we'll have to wait and see what the outcome is neither you and I know that answer.

"If I live in a cold dry country and i sell umbrellas at £10 each I may sell a few “not many”, so my price would stay the same may even drop"
No the prices of the umbrellas wont stay the same considering the currency will still succomb to its scheduled yearly inflation if not higher. Again these are factors you keep missing as it's quite evident you dont understand the precepts of this current monetary system.
Yes the 1000 you have in paypal who stay the same in your account, but your purchasing power wont.
"I know people who bought in late who are still waiting for price rises so their in profit again"
Again if you're a savvy investor, you DCA and not buy in a huge lump sum, this principle isnt only applicable in bitcoin but all around investing. The people you know are obviously not that intelligent hence why they're paying the price.

Again to say decentralization doesnt work is to imply governance doesn't work. For money, its most likely works, so i disagree.

You speak so much in absolute, people who do that are often wrong most times than right especially when we speak about uncertainties.
Go out and ask how many people in the crypto space know about elixxir and get back to me with your response.

Just because clueless people buy bitcoin on robinhood doesnt meant there arent just as much buying and withdrawing their bitcoin from cashapp or coinbase. Gold derivatives makes perfect sense considering the logistical nightmares of physically settling gold. Ledger x, bakkt and other futures exchanges will be settling in physical bitcoins. Why? Because its software and easily settled. We'll most likely see more physically settled bitcoins futures than we'll see with gold because they're both completely and literally different assets.

I doubt a country would missile a mining farm as there are probably way better ways to shut them down. Plus you have to worry about the incentives of each nation. That means every nation would have to unilaterally agree to do it which i highly doubt as nations compete against each other.

Everyone(atleast most) has a price point where they'll be willing to sell their bitcoin, so hodling is still a means to an end(selling at a price point you see fit) There are actually only a handful of people who buy bitcoin and hodl regardless of price but majority will sell at some point, so transitory group-think is beneficial for bitcoin.

What are you talking about? I knew about the Bitcoin run in 13-14. Hell i watched documentaries on CNN on it. I knew about it then but like many others who heard about it then did NOTHING. Why? There’s a difference btw hearing about something and KNOWING what the hell it is. So you saying grandmas etc know what it is, is false if not downright disingenuous as they’ve heard about it but they sure as hell don’t know what it is. Hell lets do an experiment, go out and ask atleast 10 random people, have you heard of bitcoin? most will say yes. But then proceed to ask them. What is it or why does it exist? You’ll hear nothing but crickets. If YOU personally dont believe Bitcoin will see six figures, that’s fine but there’s no need to falsify things to fit your narrative. Happy new year guys.

Well if you’ve to listen to someone like buffet to make an investment on technology then you won’t take a gamble that could possibly make you well off. There’s something called the lindy effect that’s applicable to BTC. That’s why smart investors like andressens, Draper don’t pay any mind to people like Buffet when it comes to tech. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 17:09:26
Good point. That makes sense if every money deposited is physical cash. Most people in the US have direct deposit, so for the most part it's digital so i can see how random money generation can occur.  A perfect example is Credit cards and how compound interest takes effect.

I resonate with this. I watched an interview with catherine wood who's predicting a crazy price for tesla in the future and people are calling her crazy. I think tesla are doing something incredible in the vehicle space and yet most people dont realize they're a software company and not a car company. Updates on vehicle over the air is unheard of. I'm definitely keeping an eye on them and i'll be buying some of their stocks soon.

Best comment ever. Although with Roubini, you never know, i think $10 is giving him too much credit. $0 seems more like him to be honest.

That was the whole point of my article, that a 20k isn't that point where stability occurs in BTC. So basically it means it's on that trajectory to be a store of value and far from being a means of exchange. Investing and gambling involves risks and that's applicable to every asset known to man.
@_date: 2018-11-24 17:11:09
Have you ever used an email to send an important zip file to someone? If the answer is yes. Then imagine being able to send money/value that same way except that it can’t be confiscated and it’s cheap. That’s value. No need to be ignorant if BTC is beyond your scope of knowledge 
@_date: 2018-11-22 14:39:34
I don't think there's a video or article where draper said that, he has been saying 250k by 2022. So i don't know where you're getting your info from, please provide us links.

"Most large investors dont want to be invested in Crypto" For now. Again it's either you don't understand how BTC works or you just love trolling. You keep talking about users like BTC is some tech company, its a protocol, so company metrics arent applicable. It's meant to be money and for it to be money, it needs to be stable. And it doesnt get stable just because people use it for measly transactions like buying stupid coffee. It's first and foremost meant to be a store of value( and for it to get there you DONT spend it) Stability comes as a result of its high price and means of exchange comes subsequently. Using facebook as your rebuttal says a lot. Let me ask you a simple, lets say "stocks" were used a means of payment at starbucks, would you have used your google or facebook stocks when they were at 5 dollars a pop to buy useless coffee?

If fractional reserves does happen with bitcoin, the issuing party will only be able to loan out what they have or what their address publicly displays they have and not be able to generate random bitcoins to loan out to more parties.

I find it hard to believe you got in at that time or it's either you got in without knowing what the hell BTC was. To suggest it'll NEVER recover makes it hard to find you credible boss haha. Yes it's on a downward spiral but using the word 'NEVER' seems to imply that you know something most folks don't, and that makes me call you a bullshitter as no one in the space knows where BTC's price will be in the next few years. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 14:47:00
I just feel that bashing him does more harm than good. And its incredibly weird how some maximalist managed to turn an ally into an enemy.

My point in that regard was that, the manufacturers of cars knew that it was imperative to create the infrastructure necessary for adoption which was roads( it doesn't matter if it was governments that helped build them) The irony also is that governments might end up playing a crucial role in the global adoption of BTC if they declare that their currency will be pegged to BTC OR say that they're now stocking up on some BTC as a global settlement means.

Your sentiment could be found on this forum a couple years ago when folks kept saying it's dead and no one can make money from it anymore. If you believe that, then don't worry about putting your money in it, in four years, one of us will be right.
@_date: 2018-11-17 13:12:58
I don't know if i necessary agree with the "payment system" for merchant. How do you get something that's unusually unstable accepted? It needs to hold its value in terms of price, BTC doesn't do that. I highly doubt lightning network will resolve the volatility issue. This volatility occurs as BTC is trying to figure out its right price, and not because we don't have a lot of merchants accepting it.
@_date: 2019-01-03 12:07:00
Investing 101 has to be the most paradoxical statement ive ever heard. Yes past performances are sometimes indicative of future results. If it wasn't, hedge funds, traders, insurance companies wouldnt waste their time now with spreadsheets and charts looking for trends. People say what you're saying to feel smart but in actuality, they're not as to predict the future, you need to look at the past. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 23:30:48
That's really cool. Atleast you're on here giving your perspective in a nice manner and not roubini-esque. Yah i do agree on the part that mainstream adoption will indeed be a catalyst for a high priced bitcoin in the future. Lets see what the future holds, hopefully good things.
@_date: 2018-11-20 22:21:34
Exactly my point. BTC is barely 10years old and some folks who barely understand economics are already expecting it to change the monetary paradigm by the snap of a finger. BTC should be a store of value first, then medium of exchange comes secondary. That’s how hard money works. 
@_date: 2018-11-02 16:24:48

I think that was his point. Yearly low may occur in 2019 but it will only rise as long as there are enough people who truly understand what bitcoin is and for that reason alone wont sell. If everyone got in this space selling their bitcoins regardless of understanding then the price of BTC wont go anywhere in tens of thousands. If you think BTC is fucked, then thats your subjective truth. Only one of us will be right. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 14:39:05
I'll agree to disagree. if you think something that went from cents to 5k doesn't hold value, then there's not that much we can talk about. Thanks for your comment regardless.

Underrated meme
@_date: 2018-11-29 16:00:07
Trying to sound really intelligent isn't working for you. To blatantly say that BTC will NEVER have another explosive growth implies you know something none of us know. And for that sir or ma'am, i call you a bullshitter. No one knows where BTC will be in 10 years but one thing is for certain, as long as lindy effect is still in effect, BTC will have just one trajectory and thats upwards(barring a black swan event) until it plateaus. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 21:24:38
Well you sound like you no economics background as well hence my rebuttal. I’m using it as a store of value and many more are doing exactly the same hence why it hasn’t gone to 0, so your claims on people not using it for either is false. Adoption again comes with time so based on fundamentals, it will find its price and it’s definitely more than 20k if you truly understand how and what the implications of BTC are. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 13:26:11
Something that was worth a cent is now 5k, thats pretty much the evidence i need to make that assumption. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 17:14:17
Then you're not watching nor are you listening. The fact that there are institutional interests(most don't want them in crypto) is part of what adoption looks. They'll take it to a point where average joes wont be able to afford one. And plus you cant expect to see full adoption in just 9 years. Hell it took gold hundreds of years to achieve worldwide adoption. If you don't see BTC at 0 then that rests our case.
@_date: 2018-11-23 19:50:14
That's like saying the energy and time required to mine gold has no future. Energy plus time is one of the major factors as to why gold is valuable and that same is applicable to BTC. I hope you're not new to BTC because over time you'll understand why it has kept its lead.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:52:47
You can tell who's new to space by the nonsensical posts about Bakkt. Like Bakkt launching today was supposed to take BTC to the moon overnight. No patience whatsoever.  If it dips, buy the dip and move on.

If you truly believe people should be hand held and babysat and have their decisions made for them every single time, I'm pretty sure North Korea would be a great place for you. Plus if you believe in the idea of being your own bank, you shouldn't resort to calling people names for making financial decisions that could either turn out great or bad for them, it makes you sound unintelligent.
@_date: 2019-09-22 21:47:41
But things like Bakkt are inevitable, so i'm really astonished when people say Bakkt isnt good for BTC like these institutions would just sit back and watch it rise exponentially without getting involved. The fact that gold and silver aren't held by the average person but central banks makes price manipulation relatively easy. If BTC ends up becoming mainstream among young people, shorts would only go so far.
@_date: 2018-11-19 00:58:19
So you want bitcoin to be this global money but don't want institutions to get involved? Its not really global then is it?

How is that gas costs $3.29 now when couple decades ago it cost just a few cents? Does that sound like BS or a reality? 8k BTC sounded outlandish in 2011 but here we are.

@_date: 2019-09-23 10:40:47
When you said normal person, do you mean people in the age range 40 and above? Because ages below that don't find it hard understanding bitcoin, safe storage and private keys as majority of bitcoin holders are under the age of 40. Gold and silver are both easy to acquire but most young folks aren't buying them. My brother asked me once, where the hell did i buy gold from, and he's five years older than i am and i am 29.

Both you and the shanghai stock market are cherry picking what suits your narrative.
