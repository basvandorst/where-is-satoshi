Is  a legit source for bitcoin core? I don't want to assume anything. Anyways, I downloaded the zip file and there are 5 exe. files in the bin. Which ones do I need to run for installation? The wallet opened up and is syncing after running the bitcoind.exe file but I'm curious about the other 4 files. Can anyone drop some knowledge on this post please?

Just had to specify the sub-directory where I d/l'd initially again. think I'm good now.

Do I just use Core to open it?

so how do you restore the backed up wallet ?

ok thanks for all your help, I just had to specify which directory to open Core with , again. Happened to be the first instance where I opened BTC qt file and needed to actually re identify where the files were saved.

I saved it in a custom directory on my HDD because I don't have the space on my SSD which is the default folder. There is a folder with a few files in app data on SSD, I will check if that wallet file is there. Thanks

WELL, it's showing a different receiving address in Core now. I was thinking I had to take the backed up .dat file and put it in a different folder or replace the .dat file in another directory or something. At this point I'm just trying to understand what happened so it doesn't happen again. I'm not at risk of losing any funds because that wallet was completely empty. My Armory wallet is set up and holding all funds now so I won't be make any transactions directly through Bitcoin Core anymore anyways.

Ok so there are two directories, because the default directory is on my C: drive, the wallet.dat in the C is bigger than the wallet in my D: drive (custom directory that I saved in)

it's 'verifying' and 'rescanning' now. we'll see what happens.

ok, thanks for the advice. I'd prefer to consolidate.

Thanks for that, not sure what I am looking for though. Please advise.
Sincerely, a noob
