If you farm a bunch of food, the government will seize it for distribution.  Ergo, nobody is incentivized to harvest food and there becomes a shortage.  Socialism in a nutshell.

I thought they got back the cash value at the time, not the current BTC value, right?  The same might be the case here. 
Edit...  I was correct regarding the Mt. Gox case, and it's related to the bankruptcy law in Japan.  The OP is a civil suit and not bankruptcy, and in the UK, so it could be a different case.

Somebody who didn’t write down the keys?

But unless they pay over a 100% tax rate it could not bring them in the red for that tax period.  That's the point.

Here is a simplified scenario.  You make $100-million in net income and pay $30-million in taxes.  If you have a $30-million loss that would mean $70-million in net income, so you would still owe $21-million in taxes. 
But, that is assuming that you don't have insurance to repay the loss.  Also, if the amount of taxes were announced as owed, that would mean the loss a few days later would be applied to next years net income, so it wouldn't effect the taxes already owed and especially would NOT be a one-to-one write-off of current taxes owed.
The only conspiracy I could see surrounding the coincidental amounts is if they had insurance proceeds and used them to pay the taxes and then embezzled the "hacked" funds.

I said net income, not gross income.  Net income is net of expenses and is what taxes are calculated on.  Taxes are not calculated on revenue.

You're pissing in the wind, the general public is innumerate.

They did it backwards.  He's saying there is 1-BTC per every 411 people on Earth.

Are you comparing bot trading to murder?

Trading volume typically hovers around 40% YEN, 40% USD, 5% EURO, 5% WON and 10% other.    
Last 6-months has the YEN as high as 60% of the volume, but last 30-days has them closer to 42%.   But, still higher than USD in both instances.

Except unlike a dictatorship there is no limit put on the supply of bitcoin community sites.  You and all your friends can go start 1,500 sites tomorrow if you want.  And  only has 1,700 subs... has 50x as many subscribers, so it's virtually irrelevant.  If he paid anything to take it over he overpaid.

Depositors didn't own individual coins, they deposited the coins into a pool, so it has to be determined how the remaining coins will be divided, since there are more ownership claims than coins.  It's why so many people stress how important it is to keep your BTC's in your own wallet.  If you don't own the keys, you don't own the individual coins.

In this case it is from a bitflyer wallet to bitflyer merchant.  So $0 fees because the transaction doesn't happen on chain. Bitflyer does it all on their own ledger and it is validated with 0-confirmations.
