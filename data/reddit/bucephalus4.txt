First, if you're transferring the amount you specify above, I'd suggest using GDAX and not Coinbase. 
Second, in GDAX, once you login, click on Deposit and then Bank Wire. Enter the information in that prompt on your online bank's UI to initiate the wire transfer.
Edit: Coinbase charges $10/wire transfer .. in this case 40; my bank charges $0. So $10 in total.
e.g. Here are the field's to look for on GDAX and then enter on your bank's website:
Recipient Name, 
Recipient Address, 
Bank Name, 
Bank Address, 
Routing/ABA Number, 
Account Number, 
Recipient Instructions/Message

I suspect that Roger Ver, Jihan, etc will be orchestrating a major dump of BTC after the fork. They have enough on hand and by cashing out temporarily, they drive the BTC price down, which will temporarily lead to new/uninformed investors selling on the dip, driving down the price of BTC further. This downward movement will support their claim that Bcash is the superior of the two. I think this will lead to a good buying opportunity for HODL'ers. Bcash whales are not going down without a fight.

Yes your transaction cost expectation is correct. I just initiated a transfer to coinbase for under $40k and it went through in 2 hrs. Done it before too without issue. Not sure about limit though.

Trezor for BTC. Also integrates with Dropbox to provide labelling for each BTC transaction. Doubles as password manager  
Not too happy with Trezor for ETH though.
