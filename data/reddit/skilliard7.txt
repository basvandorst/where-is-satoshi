Do you use your system for anything other than Bitcoin? If so, you're at risk. All it takes is clicking one web exploit to wipe out your Bitcoins.
For example, it would not be unlikely for hackers to spam links to clickbait articles about Bitcoin, that actually just are links to websites with malware designed to steal your private key.

There is malware out there that specifically targets people with Bitcoin wallets, and logs their passphrase when entered to unlock the wallet.

Totally forgot about this game

That fixed nothing, fees are still way too high.

OP is saying that Bitcoin is money. Money is a store of wealth, unit of account, and medium of exchange.
Bitcoin is a store of wealth, because it's supply is limited. Yes it's volatile, but so is gold.
Bitcoin is a unit of account, because bitcoins are effectively worth the same regardless of what block they came from.
Bitcoin is not a medium of exchange anymore. If I have to pay $10 to send money and wait 30 minutes for a confirmation, it's not a medium of exchange.
There's plenty of good uses for Bitcoin. For example, oppressed Venezuelans that are stuck with a hyper-inflationary currency, that can't access US dollars and can't get their wealth out of the country.
But it is not money in the sense that I can use it to purchase all goods and services.
Years ago shopping with Bitcoin was nice. Now it's dying off and people are pretty much only using Bitcoin as speculation.

I love paying a $10 fee every time I want to spend money.
Bitcoin is a unit of account and a store of wealth, but it's becoming a fairly poor medium of exchange.

Probably had to wait an eternity for a confirmation.

I remember when BTC was at $1,200, and then the crashed happened. Every month, it went down. When it was $800, people said cheap coins. When $700, people were saying get in at the bottom. Then at $600 people said it will go nowhere but up. This continued up until it bottomed out at roughly $200.
Then you had the smartasses. "it's okay that it dropped to $200. I bought at $10 and it's a 2000% gain! it's still a great investment!", completely disregarding that people had just bought in at $1,100 and lost 80% of their value overnight, and that they themselves were making posts like "BTC will be at $2,000 by the end of the year!" right before the crash.
Eventually it did recover, years later. But I have serious doubts of BTC reaching any higher than $10,000. The block size limit is far too destructive to Bitcoin, and if it isn't fixed, Altcoins will continue to eat up market share. You can't shop online or gamble with BTC anymore without paying a lot more in fees. Every single application for BTC is being crippled by fees.

I don't know why anyone would trust their exchange after this. I imagine when they reopen everyone is gonna try to get their coins out ASAP

how was the confirmation time? Scared to use bitpay to buy stuff

Bitcoin's fees make it infeasible for poor Venezuelans. When you have to pay $3 just to send your coins, it doesn't really work for buying food.
