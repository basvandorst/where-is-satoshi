I do not drink this one. Price skyrocketed for minutes, at a point that even bitcoinity and mtgoxlive were showing a blank screen. What if somebody with full access of the system, have tried with success to sell an amount of BTC for millions of dollars,and then cashed out, possibly breaking the 1000 usd limit ? or more likely, pushed up the price, then sold a few bitcoins, to buy a huge amounts shortly after, (i noticed some ~400 BTC transactions during that short timeframe) when the price got to about 15USD

I probably wrongly titled the submission. This is in fact a first version of the incident report, but i never seen it on the official forum or here on when did it disappear ?how long it lasted online? why wasn't it brought up before ? Kind of weird how they replaced this with the shorty we all know by now.

It might be something more elaborate. Involving all the accounts in the system for the purpose of withdrawing and then run, as you say. Why is screwing the order book weird for an hack attempt ? look at the screenshot i posted. i never sold those bitcoins, so someone must have taken control of my account. Maybe mtgox stopped it in time, but they won't reveal this on a press release, for sure.
EDIT : i don't believe that the introduction of new code in the platform should trigger stuff like this in a production environment,either at mtgox they must be very incompetent about software deployment, or this is an excuse.

this is ultimately linked to bitcoins. i have noticed discussions about mining devices lately. So why not this ?
@_date: 2011-08-31 13:51:50
What you mean ? need my help?
@_date: 2011-08-25 22:22:42

Hey, i am very sorry but it's what happened, somebody rebooted the server during your operations. I do believe you were almost finished,i can send you some coin cents to compensate the time-loss.
@_date: 2011-07-29 16:41:58
yeah, but that's not automated. well, i am just fascinated about the machinery behind an hypothetical-mechanical-bitcoin-miner.What's your point?
@_date: 2011-08-05 13:50:56
Actually they overwritten  which is the same file linked on the frontpage. Might be that they changed their mind and replaced this with a simpler story ? Did anybody read this before?

Great explanation. Thanks a ton. I have had figured out that,eventually, a machine like this would be giant sized, just looking at the basic logic gate physical dimension and doing the math.
