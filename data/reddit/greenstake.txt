$8-9k is still up 1,000% in a year.

The market cap now that "the bubble has burst" is still twice what it was just two months ago.

2FA can be used to secure it.

You'll still owe taxes like you do.

The headlines talk about losses like the gains were some distant memory from years prior and this is the end of the line. Bitcoin is still trading above $10,000. We left the moon behind a long, long time ago.

If Bitcoin hits $1 and everyone stops using it, it'll be fast and cheap too...

The same party whose never work together policy led them to steal a supreme court seat from a sitting president and hold that up as an accomplishment of what not working together can accomplish?
Yeah, it's the Dems that won't budge on anything. /s

Correct, assuming you meant to say the exact opposite of what you said.
Now that he has a channel open he can use it to connect with other users/merchants/service providers.

That's why I originally started with Bitcoin. Fees were much lower than PayPal.

If you mail someone $100 but you only put a 1 Cent stamp on it and hope to sneak it by the ~~miners~~ mail people. They just leave it in the mail and never deliver it because it's not worth it for them.
After a few days, you relent and send them a $5 stamp. That's replace by fee.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:01:16
That's a wrong answer.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:51:06
You mean seven satoshi?
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:38:19


Fees are at over $10 a transaction. How could anyone possibly use it as a currency?

The method he described is horrifyingly insecure. If you keep more than a couple hundred in Bitcoin, please invest in a hardware wallet and take some time to learn about the technology.

Fees have skyrockted as getting your transaction into the blockchain is more and more competitive every day.
Average transaction has a $12.17 fee right now.
$1 tx is about 33 satoshi/byte which could take 12 hours before even being included in a block. I guess you could pre-order your daily cup of coffee 15 hours in advance if you want to use Bitcoin as a currency.

The only thing I could use it for then is buying large items. Bitcoin used to advertise lower fees than PayPal. Now the fees are approaching that of a wire transfer. I could use it to buy a car or a house, or transfer a large sum of money to someone or a financial institution, but short of that I can't imagine using it as a currency. It's like owning gold, can't use it to buy a cup of coffee.

Where did I write or even imply that I believe OP's story?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:33:22
Why would I keep a copy of a $10 note in my lockbox?
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:07:55
This has always irritated me in the Bitcoin community. People just point and condescend whenever someone loses Bitcoins when in reality it's the Bitcoin community's fault for providing people with really shitty education on Bitcoin. It's always worried me that people will lose trust in the currency when it's so easily stolen, and the solution, hardware wallets, are still too expensive for a casual user.

Good choice. I'm glad you did not listen to him.

Why should I trust the randomness of seed generation on the Trezor or Ledger? They could easily use poor or non-random generation and I'd have no way of ever knowing.

I miss being at 8,000.
