That's called gambling addiction

With something volatile like this you want to buy in a buyers market. Until things settle down you are just exposing yourself to more risk trying to time peaks and valleys 
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:34:56
That's a silly mistake if it is tanking down
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:01:03
You are right I believe 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:01:54
You better hope not for the sake of the economy

Just got some dividends this week and it makes me feel a lot better about my investments. I know some people literally only own bitcoin and are freaking out but there are other great opportunities out there. Emotional investing is dangerous and will cloud your judgement. That's why fundamentals are so important and cryptocurrencies are volatile. Half the investors probably don't even understand what a blockchain is but they are the ones pumping on these rides up.

From the person who bought it from you at that price genius

the world isnt ready for the power of bitcoin just yet, the bubble was fun, its gotta pop and revive as a true asset once blockchain really takes off.

Pro Tip, your superstitions have 0 impact on the market other than you selling.

I'd say usually it is. Monetary policy isn't always bad though

There's a few reasons that are all related. A moderate inflation rate means people are spending their money more frequently as having cash or and account with no interest is less desirable than goods. But this also means there is more demand for goods which means more business is getting done. With inflation a debt is more attractive since the real value of the debt you borrow to make investments now decreases by itself as times goes on. So basically it incentivizes spending and investment. When inflation is at a healthy level you can still match or beat it in a respectable savings account so the value of your savings stays safe but you don't want to hoard cash.

Bitcoin isn't used widely enough as a currency to prove and economic assumptions wrong. How many transactions does Bitcoin do a second? like 5-7? Visa and mastercard do like 2,000 a second. With a stable currency most inflation and deflation assumptions hold up.

What's the truth then? Keynes gets the most upvotes lol

This issue is stagnant wages. Inflation is generally a good thing in a growing economy

This sub is like incels for investing

Deflation is fundamentally an issue because it causes people to hoard money which decreases demand. If Bitcoin is coming to be a real currency it's not going to be something people just hold on to and hope for deflation. Currency arbitrage is one of the issues with fiat currency. If there is a "perfect" currency it would be one that doesn't change in value and used purely for the transfer of goods and services.

That's hyperinflation
@_date: 2019-09-28 17:33:15
I don't know what country you live in but the USD inflation rate the last 10 years has been about 2% a year which is a rate you could easily get in a savings plan.
@_date: 2019-09-28 21:02:18
It also decreases spending which shrinks the economy and causes less jobs
@_date: 2019-09-28 18:12:25
Well hyperinflation is not good. A rate around 3% a year is generally good for a growing economy
