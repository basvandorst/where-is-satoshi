Recently I sent to the creator of a music video 1 eur worth of btc, as a tip. The fee was only 3 cents worth of btc. How awesome is that!

What can we do against big "whales" manipulating the price of Bitcoin in USD? Are we hopeless? Is the only thing we can do is to watch their dump&amp;pump?

I would guess there are many (at least hundreds) of mining operations like this size. Not that much centralized.

Well, banks go to great lengths at securing your money. You should decide the followings:
* the amount of wealth you want to safeguard
* an approximation of the abilities of your possible adversaries (are they just lone hackers or do they have more resources backing them)
* according to that approximation, a strategy for protecting your private keys (cold storage, or cold storage with more than one physical location, etc.)

The devs have a principled stance. And they have a good wallet. They deserve respect.

Do you have the source code of the bot open for inspection somewhere?

He **was** running a mining operation. Not anymore as far as I know.

Be in Bitcoin not for the fiat price, but for the technology and the idea. 
You can literally send great wealth using Bitcoin to any person, anywhere on earth, without asking for permission to anyone.
