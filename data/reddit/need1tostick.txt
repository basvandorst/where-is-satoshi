Yes, there’s almost always a currency exchange going on in the middle of these transaction(s) to facilitate the transaction(s). All these places that “accept” bitcoin actually don’t, their payment processor does and pays them in fiat. Either way it doesn’t take away from the buyer(s) paid for said items with said currency’s.

They’re still cheaper than $12k for a beer and  $120,000,000 for two pizzas.

It means world will have a fair shot at mining it as well. It will flourish due to this, not fail!

The most expensive beer ever consumed with the most expensive pizzas.

It’s the btc backlog, it can take up to a day to confirm.
@_date: 2018-01-09 17:21:36
I love your client.
I think you’re looking at $8-9k if he got a good price $35-$40k if he paid top retail.
What your looking at is virtual money printers and the catch is it’s legal!!

Here’s my story.
Before Bitcoin was around I was a lurker on blackhatworld. These threads kept popping up on when bitcoin comes out its going to revolutionize the world. I laughed, a lot. Well they kept coming and coming so I read into very minimally. Liked the idea. Decided I was going to buy a gangster computer and give it a try. But I was broke AF. So I over-withdrew my account on purpose and went to play poker. Holy fuck I won. Hit for over a grand +. I’m cashing out and leaving and right when I’m about to hit the door one of the brothers that ran the game called me back in to talk about his daughters car since I was currently a mechanic. About 2 mins laters there’s a huge commotion at the door and I could hear a stun gun going off. I started laughing thinking someone was playing a prank but boy was I wrong. I realized this when the one brother looked through the office door and looked back cold stoned faced and said calmly and sternly oh my god, we’re being hit. I immediately look for exit options and realize holy fuck I’m trapped and I froze like a deer in the headlights. There was five of them total. The first guy immediately came to the window and didn’t even have to say anything, the money was handed over instantly. That gun was pointed so far sideways it was almost upside down. A second guy came through the office door. Dude was huge AF. Like you could stab him in the heart and he would still keep going huge. He yells for us to get on the ground and to give him the money.  I realize no one has a mask on and we’re all dead. At this point I’m still frozen, standing and realize my hands are in my pockets and I’m clutched to my knife. At this point I have dead set myself on stabbing this dude in the neck if I hear a shot go off. Gun is currently not pointed at me so I can at least get this one. The second brother calmly said I just gave it to your partner. The robber says your going to hand it to me now or your dead. Both the brothers start yelling they gave it to the other guy through the window. The robbers partner yells I got it let’s go. They leave quickly as fuck and a brave soul waits a few seconds and runs after them and sees the car they get into. We then figure out within 10 minutes that it’s an inside job and that mother fucker and standing right there....
Fortunately two things happened in my favor 1. I was called back into the office, or else I would’ve been the guy going out that got tased and pockets raped. 2. I was in the office and my pockets didn’t get raped.  Fast forward I get home and have over 1k cash and I need to hide this shit because Monday is over a day away. My brilliant plan was hide it between the cooling fins on my cpu. Like who would look in there? The house mate catching a glimpse of me taking my computer part while he was going to the bathroom. Needless to say my heart dropped out in disbelief Monday morning when I see the void in the cpu fins is empty. I literally take it as a sign and let it go. It’s 100% speculative what I would have done as far as how much I would’ve mined and if I would’ve held on to them or got screwed out of them. I however am not regretful at all. I’m very happy where I’m at in life and believe anything could’ve changed it and I could be miserable right now. I do currently mine. I like to mine rather than buy even though I do buy on top of it. I like mining because it forces me to invest in my family’s future everyday.

Absolutely awesome information to have! Thanks!

Long live Bitcoin! 
.... and the site is down. Nothing can handle bitcoin but itself.

It’s like creating a retirement account we can’t be screwed out of. Been there done that. Trust no one. Even if people can only afford a few dollars they should do it.

Please do! Would love to hear the story of success!
I would spend time trying to get into the Coinbase account as well. Clues could be had from here. You can see the balance of the wallets that were transferred to and from publicly. That could let you know if what you’re after is 0 or A lot.
If he had a considerable amount we was probably cashing out through Coinbase.
Then there’s possibilities he was trading and that info might be there too as the wallet to address could be an exchange.

Correct, just speculation at the moment!
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:49:25
The miners will continue to mine for the fees alone. The last stage of mining payout is 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin, also know as a Satoshi. Imagine what bitcoin will be worth then...  All we can do is imagine because none of us will be around to see it!
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:06:50
And have it delivered right to your door!
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:07:06
Yes, this is a pure speculation!

Best thing to do right now is freeze and do nothing with your bags. Come back in 6 months and see how it’s going and so on.
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:52:01
So they want to tax it and issue guidelines but also want to make it illegal. Whole lot of retard in their thought process.
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:52:11
We are under attack from all angles.
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:28:22
That’s a cool idea.
@_date: 2018-02-12 13:32:23
The side with the most hashing power wins 
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:01:16
So the chains would come back together and all transactions on the chain with the most hashing power would take precedence over the smaller one.
@_date: 2018-02-06 00:43:26
But does it scan?
@_date: 2018-02-04 22:33:35
Either way millions of people just herd about it. Google is going to be busy with bitcoin searches.
They did us a solid.
@_date: 2018-12-11 00:19:37
What’s your first question about it?
