Nobody in their right mind would. You could bet they'd only sell it back to you for more than $150k.
Plus all you get left with is paper monopoly money - if the banks were offering people $150k for bitcoin, this would surely soon be worthless.

First they ignore you
Then they laugh at you
Then they fight you
Then you win

Best thing is it can be both, and many more things.

Continually move it when required, as suggested.

Funnily enough many 'third world' countries I have visited would probably keep going and do just fine - or at least, much better than most 'developed' countries.
Pretty much any country that has cities/towns surrounded by fields with fresh local produce and no dependence on supermarkets and factory-produced, centralised food supplies that come from thousands of miles away (ie most of the 'developed' world).
This would basically be a preparatory measure for any place that wished to do better, ensure most of the local produce is kept/consumed locally and that it's sufficient to feed the populace - and export the remainder. This is basically the opposite of what happens now though and the engineered western markets are embarrassing with some of the loops that are jumped through, that have made local farming impossible.
There's also countries that survive presidential coups and other uprisings, which you'd expect to trigger some kind of collapse, but in reality, people just go about their daily lives, the food is still available and most people are perfectly content.
In the west though, you'd know for sure on day 1 because the media would propel everyone into a furious frenzied drama - there would literally be some guy sitting in an office, photoshopping little headline images with  and that would be a dangerous-as-fuck time to be around.
The fact that we can imagine/speculate how batshit everything would be is a reflection of that panic-frenzy we've been subjected to many times thanks to the media, films, etc... In fact, take a think now, how many times in your life have you ever EXPERIENCED some effect of something, directly, that you read on the (even local) news. Likely 0.1% of the time.

Very good - Keep it up! The world needs creative people who try hard, and you've got a skill there. Imagine how great you'll be if you practice this for the next 10 years. Better than even people with degrees from universities. Practice is more important than everything :)

The sloppy and generally poor way the entire politics of Brexit was handled is more than enough reason for anyone to buy &amp; hold Crypto.
These politicians literally have one job in their entire lives in many cases, but when it comes to negotiations, planning &amp; procedures, they flounder about as if it's the first time they've ever put together anything (apart from the endless streams of bullshit they're willing to say in order to get elected in the first place).
