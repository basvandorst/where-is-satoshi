They can't.  But some folks exchange their Bitcoins for IOUs from an exchange.  This is poor practice.  Some advocate exchanging bitcoins for IOUs from second layer networks.  This is also bad practice.  There is no substitute for keeping your wealth on the actual Bitcoin blockchain, with keys you control.

Fractional reserve is not currently possible when only counting transactions originating from actual on-chain addresses.  As the ecosystem is pushed toward off-chain solutions for scaling, we will no longer have the luxury of looking only at these transactions.  As end-users will no longer have the option of working directly on the blockchain for all of their transactions, the definition of the network must then include off-chain transactions as well.  We must have off-chain networks that maintain the integrity and value of our unit of currency, or it will quickly fail as a store of value.

They are running the mining prices up on themselves, and pushing their company toward insolvency.  Bitcoin trapped as dust due to high transaction fees cannot be withdrawn.  If it cannot be withdrawn, it cannot be counted toward reserves.  If they lose some of their reserves, then they operate at partial reserves.  That means risk of insolvency.

* One of the current top 5 crypto exchanges will suffer a severe hack, losing millions of dollars in assets.
Everyone who put in the limit orders from above just lost their funds.  Lol.
* At least one of the projects that raised over $100m last year will fail spectacularly.
* A coin that is not on coinmarketcap now (and is not a bitcoin fork) will break the top 5 in market cap.
* A sovereign nation (likely with a population smaller than New York) will announce plans to move to a digital currency.
* A decentralized peer to peer exchange will reach top 5 in daily volume for crypto only exchanges.
* Bitcoin options will begin trading and will help create a decrease in volatility compared to 2017.
* A crypto-funded political group will arise and start backing candidates in the US midterm elections (there will also be crypto-lobbyists).
Great, friends of Ver start a political party.  Just what we need.

There is no reason the funding of a channel must come from the Bitcoin network.  It can equally come from the lightning network side.

In fact, there will be less information available on transactions in LN than there is on transactions through the Bitcoin network.  So it will be even less possible.  If you require KYC on Bitcoin network transactions or LN transactions then you cannot take part in the network at all.  KYC is impossible in both of these networks.

It's not possible for a LN node to require KYC.  All payments are encrypted and onion routed (think TOR).  All nodes have zero knowledge of the origin of all payments.  A node can accept all traffic or none, but cannot block specific sources as they have zero visibility into the source.

You do not understand.  A hub will only have information on nodes directly connected to them.  That means those exactly one hop from them.  Much as you do not care who is along the path from you to google.com when routing your TCP/IP packets, it will not matter who is between you and your payee when you send funds.  You have a relationship with your ISP for TCP/IP transmission.  You will have a relationship with one random node somewhere on the internet for bitcoin transmission.  If you do not like the requirements of that entry point node, pick another.  It need not be in your country.  Any individual can run one.  Any node not directly connected to you has no idea they are routing your payments.

There is no need to settle unless someone on the lightning network tries to misbehave.  The threat of the ability to settle keeps everyone honest.
Additionally, there is no reason the funding of a channel must come from the Bitcoin network. It can equally come from the lightning network side. A channel with no funds can be created without any on-chain transactions. It can then be funded with a lightning network transaction. This will evolve as the lightning network maintains more funds, as a natural progression.  This way, we may not even need larger blocks.  We could scale "to the moon" as is.

Bitcoin kept in an exchange wallet can be borrowed by other clients of that exchange for a short-sale.  A short sale occurs when someone borrows bitcoins and sells them.

Arbitrageurs generally keep the futures price equal to the underlying price plus the cost to take out a loan to buy the underlying at the risk-free interest rate from the current date to the contract settlement date.

Coinbase lets you send to email addresses if you don't know their public address.  If you do know that, then you can send it directly or sign a transaction and email it to them.  The latter has the benefit that you don't lose the bitcoins until they get the email and broadcast the transaction.

I buy every week, and will continue to do so until no further coins are being offered.  Realistically, that means I will continue to get fewer coins for my dollars as I continue to buy for the rest of my life.  I don't actually expect sellers to completely dry up.  I have never sold any amount of Bitcoin, but I have used some as transaction fees as I manage my accounts.
I consider Bitcoin a store of value, a means of wealth preservation that cannot be denied by any public or private entity.  With continual regular purchases, the cost averaging means I never pay a huge penalty for the volatility.  Low prices during bear market periods make up for high prices during bull market periods.  By the time my peers understand how to use Bitcoin for wealth preservation, I expect to have the majority of my wealth already in it.

You need to read more on payment channels.  They do settle on the blockchain, they make use of multisig transactions and nlocktime to avoid the need for third party trust, and there is no risk of losing your funds if you drop offline.  The original delayed transaction would return all funds absent another signed transaction authorising the returning of less than full funds.

If 1 BTC isn't enough of a fee to get there, then what is?  That's the point.  There is no fee that will allow a higher transaction rate.

There is no way around that while still using the Bitcoin blockchain.

The test didn't last long enough for unconfirmed transactions to be dropped from mempools.  Once that happens, we enter the phase where Bitcoin begins to look flaky.  Transactions that were, at time of submission, completely reasonable are then subject to being randomly dropped after a lengthy period in purgatory instead of confirmed.  So the Bitcoin experience then becomes one of locking your coins up in purgatory for some chance a transaction might go through.
There is nothing any of the miners can do to help at that point.  Their hands are tied by the block limit.  They see transactions they know have a reasonable fee, but they cannot include them in the next block.  The best thing to do here would be to allow miners to collect those fees, making any potential transaction spammer less wealthy, and clearing up the backlog of unconfirmed transactions.
It's simply not possible to spam the blockchain forever when there is no hard block size limit.  It would cost an infinite amount of money.  But add in the block size limit and suddenly you actually create a means to spam and disrupt the network for very little money.

One more time, no funds can be stolen.  The full refund transaction is broadcast when the payment channel is first created.  It includes an nlocktime for the time the payment channel is to be destroyed.  Third party services are completely unnecessary.

The one firm requirement I have is that the channel should be implemented to settle on the Bitcoin blockchain.  Entirely off-chain transactions, such as those implemented by Coinbase for transfers between their customers, are not acceptable.
We should also think about how we want to handle reporting of number of transactions for statistical analysis.

This would just result in the rest of us being cutoff from the main blockchain and mining a destined-to-be-orphaned chain.  The largest share of hashrate defines the main blockchain.  This is currently in China.  Using your ideas, Chinese miners could cut the rest of us off from mining, and keep all the block rewards for themselves.  They have financial incentive to do so, and you would be giving them the technical means.
We need a hard limit to resist DoS attacks.  But it can be a dynamic limit that scales with the average block size over the last N blocks.

You all seem to be missing the point.  Securing your private keys is just one requirement.  You are all pushing products that aim to solve that one requirement.  Without the second requirement being met, you have accomplished nothing.  If your internal database has been breached, and it authorises a large withdrawal, or even a series of smaller ones, based on fictitious balances, nothing you have done to secure your private keys will help.  Your system will happily send the funds because it has access and thinks it is supposed to do so.  You need triple entry bookkeeping, implemented with a blockchain.  This is the only way to guarantee the validity of your books and protect your funds.

I agree.  But it's not a fixed block size.  It's a fixed maximum block size.  As we haven't been operating at the maximum limit yet, any change to the maximum block size is not overly risky.  Letting our average block size actually smack into the maximum would be a huge change from the way things have been operating and growing.

I am well versed in the technical limitations of Bitcoin.  You kill it more quickly once transaction submission is perceived as unreliable by end-users.  To say I hate miners is quite unsubstantiated.  I have a long history of mining.  Perhaps you don't realize we had a 32MB block size limit at the beginning.  It was reduced to 1MB to combat DoS spam, not as an economic benefit to miners.  We made it clear this limit would be raised as required to accommodate more real transactions.
Miners have the choice not to add transactions with subpar fees.  This is a soft limit imposed by rational self-interest, rather than a hard limit imposed by the code.  This allows real negotiation between end-users and miners to establish a fair fee.

No.  If the fee means using Bitcoin is more expensive than using the credit card networks, then that serious business man will use the credit card networks.  Bitcoin fees are capped at the transaction fee of credit card networks.  Anything higher than this ultimately results in non-use of the Bitcoin network.  Once you hit that fee cap, the only way you will increase total fees is by increasing the number of transactions in a block.

No.  Regardless of what you pay as a transaction fee, if blocks are full, then by definition there will always be a set of transactions that simply cannot be included in the next block.  The best you can do is guess at what transaction fee should be more than enough to guarantee inclusion in the next block.  But then if everyone does that, they are simply raising the bar and are likely to be wrong again.  If everyone is using a wallet that sets a 1 BTC transaction fee, then you will have transactions with a 1 BTC transaction fee that do not get included in the next block!
@_date: 2015-05-30 03:20:23
How do end-users determine a reasonable fee?  Is it reasonable to ask them to inspect the current state of the unconfirmed transaction pool prior to sending a transaction?  If all end-users or wallet software did this, suddenly the reasonable fees they used in their transactions would be unreasonable.  Transactions that should have been accepted would be left unconfirmed for an indeterminate amount of time.  As their UTXOs are tied up, they lose access to their funds and grow angered at Bitcoin.  A fee market cannot solve this problem, which would be fatal.  Gavin has spent more time than he should have trying to convince you.

No, what I want, and what Bitcoin was intended to be, is a network that has the capability to accept all unconfirmed transactions in the next block for any average transaction rate.  If rate spikes happen, congestion should be expected.  But the norm should allow for all transactions in the next block if miners want to include them.
There is no reason to artificially limit block size other than to line the pockets of the miners.  We made no contract with miners guaranteeing block space to be a limited resource.  They, and the Bitcoin network, will survive on fees due to the increase in transactions per block, not due solely to an increase in fees per transaction.

* Make the total fees collected in a block visible at a glance using the color of the VR block.  Make the size of the block visible as the size of the VR block.  Add a queue of valid transactions waiting to be included in a block, ordered by fee/byte.  When a new block is found, remove those transactions from the queue.
* Add a new area where every miner has his own factory.  All blocks found by that miner should be visible as an ordered set of blocks.  Then you can visualize the properties of the blocks each miner prefers to build, such as the size of the blocks and amount of fees collected for each.
* Explore what you can visualize for the contents of individual blocks.

Child pays for parent will also not solve this problem.  If wallets and end-users don't know the fee to pay when creating the transaction, they don't know it later, either.  This is a race condition against those submitting other transactions, either new or with replacement fees.  When there are consistently more transactions than will fit into the next block, fees will simply continue increasing until end-users refuse to use the Bitcoin network.  If there's no room in the block, then there's no room.
A fee market doesn't increase the number of transactions that can be accommodated per block.  It decreases the number of transactions on the Bitcoin network.  Don't make the mistake of thinking this solves the problem.  It's throwing the baby out with the bathwater.  Bitcoin isn't yet so needed that people will use it regardless of fees.  It would be replaced.
@_date: 2015-05-30 04:08:42
You really don't understand.  People will be pushed away by the unreliability of submitting transactions to the Bitcoin network.  There is no way to know beforehand what fee will be required to jump to the head of the line, even when submitting a fee replacement.  It's nondeterministic.

"The way it is" would imply the network behaving as it does now.  Right now all transactions with at least 0.0001 BTC fee is added to the blockchain within the next couple blocks.  If you want to maintain that behaviour, you must allow for more transactions per unit time.  That means larger blocks, shorter block times with the appropriate adjustment to the coinbase reward to maintain the 21 million limit and inflation curve, or moving transactions off the blockchain.  As nothing else parallels the security of Bitcoin's blockchain, the latter means giving up some amount of security.  I prefer some combination of the first two options.
@_date: 2015-05-04 07:48:53
Of course that makes all the difference.  Bitcoin is the most secure blockchain precisely because of the mining hash power.  Altcoins have failed to compete with Bitcoin's first mover status here.  It's disingenuous to call the post-fork Bitcoin an altcoin, as it implies it will fail.  But that will not be the case because post-fork Bitcoin will have the full backing of Bitcoin's mining hash power.

I wish that was true.  By operating at fractional reserve, more Bitcoins can be sold short than really exists.  Noone would be the wiser until too many people tried withdrawing the Bitcoins.  This is a bigger problem with large exchanges that operate off-chain transactions.  It reduces the odds of Bitcoins actually being withdrawn.  For example, if Coinbase decided to operate at fractional reserve, they'd have a much easier time now that they enable payments between two Coinbase accounts without having to turn the payments into real Bitcoin.

I think you are under the mistaken impression that miners take an amount for fees proportional to the amount of bitcoin being sent.  That is not the case.  Fees are separate from amount transfered.  You can have have any size fee you like, regardless of the size of the transaction, as long as you have enough to cover it.

No person has an more authority than any other, whether that be a "Bitcoin Core" developer with commit access ("core developer"), a miner from China, or a CEO of a large Bitcoin-centric startup.
What is important:
1) We must embrace and support an ecosystem of multiple implementations of the Bitcoin protocol
2) Well-behaved implementations of the Bitcoin protocol must work and be accepted by the network.
3) Misbehaving implementations must not be allowed to harm the network.
In this spirit, we will need a standardised approach to controversial features and changes in the Bitcoin protocol.  For example, a common threshold for level of support should be exceeded before any hard-forking behaviour is actually enabled.  Once it is enabled, it should be enabled across all implementations simultaneously.  Such features are protocol-level and thus must be globally adhered to by all implementations when the required level of support is reached on the network.

Yes, it does.  For appropriate amounts, it does.  But it's even worse if you are competing with checks or ACH payments for larger transactions.  Those are effectively free!  So now your fee cap is going to be close to 0 before fees begin to result in Bitcoin non-use.  The only way you will ever increase total fees in this area of larger transactions is to increase the number of transactions in a block.

Imagine a Trezor built into a sim card that you just stick in your phone.  It remains to be seen how secure their hardware is, if they open source any part of their product, and if it requires a central server to operate.  But the basic premise of Trezor-in-a-sim-chip is good.  It solves the basic security problem for mass adoption, and does so on the most common piece of hardware in existence.  I could see this being the big mass enabler for Bitcoin.  Most people have a cell phone these days, even in Africa where they already use their phones for money transactions.

Take a US dollar bill.

Only the entity that invented that particular color of colored coin can issue them, though anyone can trade them to others.  These trades would be a transaction of the underlying coin, with its color ignored, and a fee processed just as with all other transactions.

Beyond the list of words that is stored inside your Trezor and on a physical paper card for backup, there is also the pin and an optional password.  The pin protects access to the Trezor.  The optional password acts as another secret word that is combined with the other words.  This optional password is not stored in the Trezor.  It further secures your wallet such that it is impossible to get all of your secret words even with an electron microscope and access to your Trezor.  The password is simply not stored in the Trezor at all.  This is the ultimate in security.  But be warned that if you lose this password, you will lose access to your Bitcoins forever.  You need the password when accessing your wallet whether through the Trezor or through your backup list of words.

I think you're missing the point that the unbanked have no alternative.  They currently have no means of saving money for the future at all.  Anything they save is up for grabs the next time someone robs them.  Bitcoin offers the unbanked a means of saving money for their future and/or operating a business.
For the unbanked, an online wallet service such as BitGo would keep their funds safe.  For those with older non-smart phones, technology will soon hit the market that acts as a layer between phone and SIM card.  A prototype has already been demonstrated.  This is used in conjunction with an online wallet to offer security against theft or interception even by the Telco.

Create a Bitcoin wallet that might be called "Bitcoin Consumer Wallet".  This wallet sends colored coins representing revocable Bitcoin payments at the direction of the wallet owner.  Alternatively the payment can be tracked another way if desired.  Consumer protections are offered through this by the company running the consumer wallet.  If a complaint is made by the consumer within 30 days, dispute resolution services are engaged as is done by credit card companies today.  Otherwise, after 30 days the actual Bitcoin payment is made by the Consumer wallet company.  This of course reintroduces the risk of fraud and charge-backs for merchants accepting the consumer bitcoin payments.
Another alternative that addresses only the ability to cancel transactions: How about wallets simply send all transactions with a lock time that allows you to cancel your transaction any time prior to that lock expiration by sending the coins to yourself first.  Point of sale software could see the pending transaction and let you know it looks good.  If the transaction looks wrong, or the merchant doesn't even see it because you sent to the wrong address, then you cancel it immediately.

You are making some questionable assumptions.  You present your question as if an increase in the number of transactions means a correlated increase in number of unspent transaction outputs (UTXOs).  You can grow block size by 20x without any increase in UTXOs at all.  Additionally, you also present the assumption that an increase in the maximum block size means a rapid increase in the average actual block size.  That is definitely false.

I read through this.  It's full of mostly poorly thought out arguments.  For example, it argues that cloud mining can be used to rent mining power that can attack the network.  In reality, an attacker would also need the power to choose which blocks are being mined so they can choose their own private chain.  Cloud miners are not given that power, and thus cloud mining cannot be used to attack the network by someone renting space in that cloud.  The paper is full of things like this, without anything standing out as being a real security risk.

Use nLockTime to craft a transaction which will be valid at a specific time in the future, and give the transaction to the beneficiary.  The transaction should spend the bitcoin outputs to an address controlled by the beneficiary.  Some time before the transaction becomes valid, you need to spend those bitcoin outputs with a new transaction (without nLockTime) to keep that first transaction from being broadcast to the Bitcoin network and sending your bitcoins to the beneficiary.  Then just repeat with a new nLockTime transaction.

One can short Bitcoin futures without borrowing a bitcoin.  But once the spread between futures and the underlying bitcoin is wide enough, someone will come in to collect that spread.  This act of arbitrage will result in a Bitcoin futures buy and a short sale of actual bitcoin.  That short sale will require borrowed bitcoin on any full reserve exchange.  If you want to support the price, you can keep your bitcoin off exchanges, especially those suspected of operating a partial reserve operation, and thus allowing naked shorts.  It will be impossible to operate partial reserve once enough customers ask to withdraw their bitcoin.

My recommendation is to offer a market where others can list their buy/sell orders in your ATM.  You take a commission on all sales. Different views of the market can be created, including the view of this one ATM's market, a merged view of the markets of all of your ATMs within a certain radius, and a merged view of all of your ATMs globally.  Every ATM has its own market, but people will want to see how they can setup profitable trade routes, and these other views will help with that.
Much like any other exchange, someone will have to a) deposit their bitcoins to offer them for sale with a standing order, and b) deposit their USD to bid on bitcoins with a standing order.  This would thus need to be an account-based system.
This type of system design would eliminate the risk associated with the unbanked ATM concept.

Perhaps when such technology is ready to be deployed we can look at it as a way to relieve the pressure of larger block sizes.  In fact, it may allow us to make blocks smaller.

This is a misrepresentation.  They are less concerned with mining centralization than they are with exclusivity of the network as a whole.  What good is a fully decentralized network that nearly nobody can use?  As Mike said, in the face of such a Bitcoin network, the alternative for most of the rest of the population will be fully centralized solutions, such as banks.
In addition, who is going to run the nodes for a network that only the 1% get to use?  Do you honestly expect the 99% to run these nodes for them, for free?  If the 1% are paying for nodes to be run, the nodes belong to them.  Is that the *decentralization* you want?

Even if you did get an immediate answer, by the time the miners finish the block they are working on now and assemble the next block, that answer could change.  Your fees compete with those of other users, including those who are spamming the network.
It's an arms race now.  But if any form of RBF gets widely adopted, it will turn into an even worse dynamic real-time arms race as each user bumps up his fees in an endless feedback loop.

The data you must keep secure is the private key.  When using a Trezor, your private key is never communicated to the host machine.  Instead, the transaction to be signed is sent to the device, and a signed transaction is sent back to the host machine.  This signed transaction is not sensitive data.  So the host machine is never in possession of any sensitive data.
You could plug your Trezor into the personal laptop of the most skilled hacker in the world, and send transactions for hours, and the hacker would get no useful information out of it.  Even the input of your PIN is scrambled each time as the Trezor randomly shuffles the keys you use to input it.  So the hacker gains no useful information watching you click on the virtual keypad on his screen.

No.  There is literally no more room for transactions in blocks.  We could have 1000 times as many miners, and there would be no effect.

Rather than thinking of a mempool size limit, think of what happens to the mempool when a node restarts.  Then think about the average time a node is run before being halted, perhaps to backup a wallet, and then restarted.  At that time, anything in the mempool of that node will be discarded.

A decentralized blockchain is made secure by the proof required to create blocks.  The miners of Bitcoin will not perform this function for free.

This coin uses something they have called "Proof of Importance".  On the face, it appears to suffer from the same fatal flaws as Proof of Stake.  They just added some sugar on top to promote velocity of money.  This coin will still require centrally-signed checkpoints to avoid the issue where you can rewind to any point in the blockchain where you had a large amount of "Importance", and then build a new blockchain from that point.
Any algorithm that uses something within its own blockchain for proof is fatally flawed in this regard.  Proof of work requires something that comes from outside the blockchain: computing power.  This is dictated by the laws of physics, not the blockchain.  Using data in a blockchain to prove the validity of that blockchain is like using verses from the bible to prove the existence of God: it is circular reasoning.

Proof of Stake is flawed.  Using something within the blockchain (stake) to prove the correctness of the blockchain is like using the bible to prove the existence of God.

It's not possible to pay off the national debt.  According to  the U.S. M2 money supply is almost $15 trillion.  According to  the U.S. national debt is larger than this.  So even if every dollar was used to pay down the national debt, more would still be owed.  This is because every dollar that is created is lent out with interest, and payable only with dollars.  So there is never the possibility to pay it back.  One cannot pay off a loan of $10 plus interest when you can only use the $10 you were given to pay it back.

That may be the idea, but have you seen the growth of the money supply over the past few years?  The only thing keeping the Fed's excess money from inflating the dollar into irrelevance is the banks have not started lending it.  Why?  Because interest rates are so low, it's better to keep the money locked down with the Fed.  Once rates begin to rise, and it's profitable to lend money again, all of that excess money will come rushing into the economy.  The dollar will inflate ridiculously quickly.

Yes, 21 million is the hard limit.  A fork that changes this would not be Bitcoin.  The original Bitcoin would still be here.  Historically, all competing cryptocurrencies that have removed limits on the number of coins have instantly nosedived in value and become irrelevant.  So we'd be sitting tight with our real Bitcoin watching and laughing at the new fork scam.
Note that I recommend you obtain Bitcoin before any forks for the sake of your own security.  That way you will have your coins on both the new fork and the old one.  Then you don't need to guess which will keep value.  Forks will be irrelevant to you.

A centralized blockchain would have to be "mined" by those financial institutions alone.  Nobody else would have access, nor incentive to mine.  To the rest of the world it would be no different than current systems, other than potential increases in speed of delivery.  Such blockchains could be used to transfer fiat currencies somewhat more efficiently than SWIFT.  But they could not be used as a store of value beyond the value of the fiat currencies represented.
No government or organization will trust a digital coin backed not by a decentralized network of mathematical proofs, but by other governments and organizations.  This would be too easy to manipulate.
So, again, use in transferring value of existing currencies?  Perhaps.  Use as a new currency or store of value?  Never.

Centralized blockchains might work when the blockchain is to be restricted to a single legal entity, such as a single company or government.  But they will never work across multiple legal jurisdictions.  The Middle East, for example, will never adopt a cryptocurrency created and controlled by the U.S. government.  AMD will never adopt a cryptocurrency created and controlled by Intel.  A global cryptocurrency must also be decentralized if you want global adoption.

relationship to the Dollar.
This third key takeaway is incorrect for the USD this time.  The Federal Reserve has created a great deal of money that is currently sitting in banks' Fed accounts earning little interest.  An increase in rates means it will be profitable for banks to actually place that money in the economy by loaning it out.

Bitcoin is more secure than the existing fiat-based infrastructure.  Those systems typically rely only on SSL and centrally signed digital signatures.  Bitcoin's hashing will secure any outputs sent to an address that has never spent an output.  In essence, if quantum computers were to be invented tomorrow, your public key/address would need to be kept private just like your private key until the core devs modified the work function to something quantum-difficult and began that fork just prior to the first problematic block.  Then you could spend again.  It might take a few hours to fix.

The purpose of discounted future cash flow analysis is to estimate the money an investor would receive from an investment, adjusted for the time value of money. The time value of money assumes that a dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow.  That is actually the easy part.  The difficult part is the projection on how much money will be received from an investment.  Thus, discounted future cash flow analysis takes an input of future profits and gives an output of future profits in today's dollars.  That in no way provides any solution to the problem of finding the input value (future profits) to feed to this function.  You are simply clouding the discussion with complex topics that do not further your argument at all.

When these companies approach Bitcoin payment processors with a request to take bitcoins as payments from consumers, that is real adoption in the retail sector.

Key words being "some things."  A well-defined budget can be moved into private transactions to maintain secrets.  Everything else should be public by default.

Stolfi has a long history of opposing Bitcoin.  His comment to the SEC  is not unexpected.  Your reactions to his comment are not unexpected.  He plays his game very logically.  He realizes the commotion his comment will cause, and has been careful to first associate himself with those things he believes could help Bitcoin succeed.  In that way, he hopes to take those things down as well through the [fallacy of guilt by association](
His hope is the Bitcoin community will attack anything with which he previously associated.  Our best defense is to avoid falling into the trap of fallacies, and to evaluate all ideas and arguments on their own merits, regardless from where they originated.  Do not let anyone control your actions simply by watching what ideas someone supports and  picking a "side" based on your like or dislike of that individual.
Stolfi's plan is long-term.  He has been around for quite a while.  Some fun reading from his University home:

Do LN nodes support TOR yet?

We hear much about the man who purchased the pizza with bitcoins.  We should hear more from the man who decided to sell pizza for bitcoins.  He took the risk.

I don't see any study on the impact of a changing network topology or decreased network node count on relay latency.  I would like to hear more on how robust this design would be in the face of a sudden drop in node count, or a damaged topology, such as one under attack at the State level.  Are there any models on how this adds to or subtracts from antifragility?

Quotes from the article:

What someone does with the bitcoins after I pay them does not change that I paid in bitcoins.  If you use a USD-denominated credit card to buy an item from Europe that is priced in Euros, you still paid with USD.
You are confusing method of payment with denomination of price.  Bitcoin is not yet at a high enough market cap to provide a price stable enough to use as the denomination for salable goods and services.

1) Checkpoints are deprecated.  The last one was in 2014.  A new checkpoint is unlikely to ever be created.
2) The longest chain wins, regardless of how far back a reorg goes.  They can go back to the last checkpoint, in 2014.  Miners can choose to add to shorter chains, but that will not generally be profitable as everyone else will be synced to the longest chain.  Your mining reward on the shorter chain will not exist on the longer chain.  So the incentives are aligned against such mining.
3) I assume you mean miners here.  Miners have a vested interest to watch the network and keep mining the chain they believe will have long term value.  So they will watch the network any way they can to try to avoid being on the wrong side of a split.  If something odd happens, perhaps a very deep reorg, they will try to assess if it's likely to be reversed by devs with a POW change, reversed by nodes with a rule change, or reversed with another reorg by colluding miners, and they will mine the appropriate chain to ensure profitability.
