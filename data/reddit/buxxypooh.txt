Why would they knock at your door tho, unless you suddenly start acting like a drug dealer, buying a shit load of things and bragging at everyone, they won't really care about you

The "holding" mentality is always better than panic selling, but there should be a middle
If you keep waiting you'll never really enjoy that money, so what's the point?
My advise is to spend a bit of it whenever you want to
You can have an easy life from now on, become a cyber nomad, experience life
Also keep in mind that you might find another opportunity like BTC, or get a job you like with a decent salary on the side
You've hold it for long enough, don't let it become unhealthy

Yeah but like what do you plan to do with that money?
I'd personally never get any issues like that, I want to know why you think you would

There are some exchanges but they're not official ones so you never know if you're gonna get scammed or not

People kept asking the same question since it got passed 1k
Keep asking, the price won't wait for you

Do you know how taxes work?
Don't answer that

No one forbids you to exchange btc against another altcoin with low fees
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:38:31
Yeah that's right, sneak that referral link, SNEAK IT IN ALL OVER YOUR ARTICLE
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:40:22
Yeah, but only once
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:11:26
Why would you need 100k to spend right now
You found a nice car to buy or what
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:49:07
Irrelevant question that is over asked, do you even read this subreddit?
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:46:22
I think you forget all the things that btc made possible
I don't say I like that high fee, it's just normal with such a demand
And compared to all the good things that btc brings, it's not that dramatic
I'd say check your privilege?

You can open a Wirex account, get them deliver you a credit card, and withdraw the money
Their taxes policy is basically them closing their eyes unless the law ask them about you (if I got it right)

Not anonymous, you have to give some personal details
But the transparency is good and the daily limit is pretty high

We'll never know his motivations, but I'm pretty sure he was saying the same thing at each first drops after each big pikes
See you at the next drop, kakakid
