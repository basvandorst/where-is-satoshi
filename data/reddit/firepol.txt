Because with this fork, his team was not decent enough to change address format. To make things even more confusing, he acquired the domain name bitcoin.com where he doesn't advertize bcash as "bitcoin cash", but as "bitcoin", same crap for the wallet apps on android and ios... this leading many newbies to send bitcoin balances to bitcoin cash addresses, because their friend / relative / whatever didn't know that their address was "bitcoin cash" (instead of bitcoin).
If they would have changed address format, like the other forks, people trying to send bitcoin to bitcoin cash addresses would get an error message before sending, and the transaction would not even be broadcasted...
This is why for me bcash is a scam (not to mention the pump and dump schemes).
He would have been fair and make a normal fork without claiming it to be the real bitcoin, and without confusing people, it would be just fine.
He started the battle saying bullshit like bitcoin cash is the real bitcoin... so he deserves all the shitstorm he created.

True, it's not a "currency" in several countries... but the question was asking which one is a "digital currency". Paypal dosn't have the "currency" keyword anywhere because in fact it's a service, a website, whatever, and no currency at all. I mean you can't buy "paypal tokens" for now, but with all these altcoins coming, I'd not be surprised if in the future we'll see a paypal crypto token (to try to survive) ;)

So if we democratically answer yes, you will convince all exchanges to add an option to display mBTC, like the Electrum wallet allows to do that in the settings?
It would be awesome to get rid of all those 0.0xxx exchange rates... Example Litecoin/Bitcoin:
1 LTC = 0.019958 BTC ... (ugly)
1 LTC = 19.959 mBTC!
It would definitively reduce headaches when trading altcoins against bitcoin, not to mention against fiat currency...

No, the question was clear. PayPal is not a "digital currency". The only "currency" in the list is bitcoin. If the question was "what can you use to buy stuff online?" then it could have been misinterpreted because "what" can be a service, a currency, whatever...

What happens say if you purchased some stocks some years ago, spend e.g. 10k, stocks price went down to 5k, you sold them, and with these 5k bought 1 bitcoin when it was at 5k, and sell the bitcoin now that it is at 10k? To me this makes 0 profit (5k loss + 5k profit = 0), thus no taxes to pay on this. Or do I miss something?

Hi there, good post. About **segwit** I wanted o create a segwit wallet, then after reading the following post (see link below) I gave up and created a standard wallet instead, because for now that seems the best choice (to avoid again spending more fees): 
**bech32/BIP173/"native segwit"**
"[...]Most importantly, bech32 segwit addresses enable native segwit transactions for Bitcoin. Those addresses always start with **bc1**."
Addresses look like regular P2SH addresses, they start with **3**. Without going into too much detail, this uses an old address type and uses segwit to spend from it. The advantage is that virtually all wallets already know how to send coins to this kind of address. One disadvantage is that to spend from those addresses, additional complexity is added to the transaction which makes those transactions slightly bigger (and thus more expensive) than native segwit transactions.
Bitstamp and GDAX have already segwit wallets, but their address begins with "3".
So I guess we are all waiting for the native segwit addresses, beginning with **bc1**, right? I wonder how long it will take for this. Also LN... exciting times ahead! In the meantime great suggestion, HODL seems always the best strategy.
Btw if you move coins from one exchange to another, they pay the fees. It seems we lose (because of expensive fees) only when we transfer to our cold wallets and want to "play" with our coins from there...

Ah well if he doesn't know what a currency is, he could have also chosen "potatoes" if it was in the answers :-) (you can also trade potatoes against other "currencies", like tomatoes :-))

Thanks for the replies guys. Interesting to see how different tax systems work. Where I live, in Switzerland, it's not relevant at all all the single trades, what matters is the coins you own.

In Switzerland, Bitcoin and other crypto currencies are treated as foreign currency and as such they have to be declared together with the other standard assets (bank accounts). So the tax department doesn't care if I did 1 trade with a bit loss and a trade with a big win to compensate the loss... What they want to know is how many assets and coins I have and their value at the end of the year. So in my example in Switzerland one can declare the stocks value to 0 (because they were all sold) and declare the purchased coins (value based on the currency exchange rate at the end of the year).
In USA: have fun guys declaring each one of your transactions, especially if you are a day trader or if you have a trading bot that does many micro transactions every day! I sympathize for you...

Another guy coming from the future... he predicted the roller-coaster that happened at 18:50 (CET)

Man how did you know this? I mean a few minutes after you posted this, the correction actually happened!
Only a $2500 USD (or 3000 €) on bitstamp, but still, quite impressive. Or this was just a little "warm up" for the 6-7k correction you mentioned?
According to your experience, what do you think the weekend will look like? The weekend can be always tricky.

Putting bitcoin on the node should be as easy as sending bitcoin to an address (e.g. from an Electrum wallet)? I didn't research this, but from what I've seen around that's what I understood, please correct me if I'm wrong.

Thank you! This script looks promising, I will give it a try, thx! I was just wondering, is there any real advantage in compiling everything vs downloading binaries from bitcoincore.org ? Since I use ubuntu I see that there is even a PPA. I may use your makefile for all the other steps thou.
@_date: 2019-02-14 10:56:37
Thank you (also for the tip ;) ) Yeah I considered the "waiting" time separately. I don't really want to "invoice" the waiting time where I do nothing but sitting in front of a screen and watch a percentage (because I will not do it anyway). I mean the estimations are for the active work time.
Opening channels, learn them etc. seems from your estimations what will require most of the work. Is it that tough to open channels etc.? Thanks for the input, I will for sure read more about this.

ssshhhh don't say that, now if I check the fee schedule I know how much you trade per month...

Still: trading 1 BTC 2000 times/month is not exactly the scenario for a small fish (or for the occasional trader or hodler), but I see what you mean, good point.

I second you... that's what we need, another stupid patent for patent trolls...

Every exchange charges you for fiat withdrawals, bitstamp charges like only 0.90 € compared to other exchanges that charge 10 €, 20 € or even more...
Bitstamp has 0.25% trading fees though, not caring if you are a maker or taker. They could have made a discount for market makers, e.g. the half (like some other exchanges do) e.g. 0.125%, that would have been nice.
@_date: 2018-03-02 11:58:34
haha with volume it decreases, so I "just" have to trade 20 millions (LOL) to get the same 0.1% fees that bitfinex offer starting from 0 volume to a new customer, for a market maker trade... on GDAX if you are a market maker: 0% fees which is not bad at all if you are patient to get your orders filled not instantly.
Man, I'm a small fish, not a whale having millions...
don't take me wrong I really like bitstamp (especially the fact that there is 0 fee to withdraw crypto, they pay the fees for you), but it would be PERFECT if they had more attractive trading fees and distinguish between maker and taker... also for small fishes ;)

[self.Bitcoin](can you share some information on how to file a police report related to cex.io? I live in Switzerland and I guess the best contact channel for me would be a web form or e-mail with the London police department? Before digging online maybe you can provide a good starting point, thank you.

Somehow you remind me this story: [
@_date: 2019-05-03 19:08:47


It's a different style of trading, could work on other exchanges with a smaller spread. But what if it doesn't converge? E.g. these days the price difference between any exchange and bitfinex is 6% and it stays 6%, it won't converge for a long time...

Once logged in in Bitfinex, when you click "WIthdraw", then select US Dollar (or Euro), you will see "min 10000") (wanted to save a screenshot here but reddit removes it).


They removed the 10k "activation", now new users can register at bitfinex and deposit as much as they want, even just a few bucks just for testing it (which is very good in my opinion). Also they removed that annoying minimum 250 USD worth of crypto for crypo withdrawals, now the minimum is 20 USD. You still pay a small withdrawal fee, but at least you are not prevented to withdraw a very small amount.
Btw did you know that for fiat withdrawals: **if a user withdraws more than 2 times** in a 30 day period, or aggregate more than $1,000,000 in a 30 day period, **they will be charged a 3% fee** for the high frequency/size. See this [announcement](
If you scroll the withdrawal page, you actually see it written:  
Fee structure: 0.1% of the amount withdrawn, with a minimum of $60.00  
3.0% of the amount withdrawn for requests exceeding the following frequency and/or size limits:  
1. more than 2 fiat withdrawals in any thirty day period; and/or,  
2. more than $1M in aggregate in fiat withdrawals in any thirty day period.

How does it work? How do I set my reddit account to receive tips?

Even stable coins have a premium of 6%, so as soon as you buy anything else on bitfinex, it costs you 6% more than anywhere else, including stablecoins.
The only way to profit from arbitrage is to withdraw fiat.
Minimum withdrawal: 10000 (10k!)
Fee: 0.1%, not bad... except that the minimum is 60 USD.
So if you withdraw 6k you'd expect a fee of 0.1% = 10 USD? Wrong: you pay 60 USD.
So you see it's not very ideal right now. If you trade on bitfinex you stay on bitfinex...
See fee structure: [
The best way to put money on bitfinex is not via deposit (for a bank wire you also need to pay minimum 60 USD and deposit at least 10k) but via arbitrage: you buy any coin on bitstamp (e.g. BTC, ETH, XRP), transfer to bitfinex, sell on bitfinex and you get 6% more fiat that you begun with. But then prices ae anyway 6% higher, so it doesn't matter....
