I have the UTXO set here if you want I can easily grep it for you. What's the prefix?

there are very few exchanges that have US ACH access.. basically coinbase/gdax, circle and gemini.. there might be a couple of others, but there isn't a huge choice. If you want to use wire transfers you're going to be paying like $35 per deposit.

well do you really need instant buys? why? if you had deposited money last week you could instant buy right now on gdax or gemini.. so really all you need is a little future planning and patience.. or a time machine. :p
I have used circle.. it's a good service.. in theory there are no fees, but in practice circle is usually around 1% above other markets.. they only allow me to buy around $250/week.

probably nowhere.. if you were organized you could take out a personal loan and deposit it at gdax and then once that goes through, you can make 'instant' purchases out of the loan balance.. replacing it via more deposits that clear 3-5 days later.. the gdax buy fees are pretty low especially if you use a slightly out of the money limit order and the interest on borrowing a few thousand for a year is probably around 7% so that's like 0.5% per month.. so as long as you make a couple of buys each month you could probably finance that 7% per year by amortizing it out to slightly less than 1% per purchase.

try  - coinbase.com doesn't really work well for canadians at the moment (no banking access). circle.com might work with a credit card although it might take a while to do $4000 due to their daily/weekly limits. You could also try with  to just buy a small amount instantly now to play around with.

well the government doesn't need too, they can just mitm the cloudflare to lbc origin server part instead and get everyone's credentials even those not using tor.
