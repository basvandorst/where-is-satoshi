Yeah, the bitfinex bug did cross my mind, I've experienced those sorts of session bugs while programming in the past.
One weird thing I forgot to mention though.  There was a cancelled withdrawal request in the history.  Those usually generate an email from Bitfinex, but there was nothing in my inbox.  Maybe the guy tried to withdraw and it didn't work - saw the email and realised that I'd see it too, and then deleted the email.

No I have a feeling he didn't know what he was doing.

Ive actually been lending out BTC for swaps a lot, only started doing margin trading recently.  I'm up 22 BTC overall so not too bad.  I did get quite worried during the Bearwhale times a couple of weeks back though.  Not sure the stress was worth it.

Yeah unfortunately the Bitcoins have to be present on the exchange to reduce my chance of a margin call (where I lose everything.)  It's definitely an added risk to have somebody else control your private keys, but it's worth it to reduce the chance of a margin call.

Yeah that's what I mean.  I needed to log in mid-way through trying to fix the phone and then forgot about doing another reset.
@_date: 2014-10-19 11:08:14
Yeah not a bad idea, I think we have an old phone lying about.  Plus I can make some Walter White jokes while I'm at it.

I was using the BTC as collateral to margin trade, so it has to just sit there.  It's very risky but I've used Bitfinex for about 9 months now and don't necessarily distrust them.
People are so cautious after Mt. Gox that any if any red flags were raised about their operation, it would be plastered all over the boards.  Other than the usual "you don't own the Bitcoins if you don't own the private keys", that is.

Yeah going to wait on the Bitfinex logs so I have some proof first.  Any IP addresses vaguely near where they're located will suffice.  I was away for the weekend without Internet so it should be fairly easy to isolate the bad guy in the logs.

I never logged in through the phone.  I assume he did a password reset via my email account and then deleted the email to hide his tracks.

You sound like my wife... apart from the charity bit.

No I said I "wasn't too drunk" at that point.  I was 3 glasses later though, and I remember having a pint of something extremely strong with a sheep on the front of the bottle.

No, I'm not planning to, since he didn't take anything.  I'm more annoyed at myself than at the hacker.
@_date: 2014-10-19 11:32:54
It just doesn't feel like a 'hacker' accessed the account - not somebody who was initially out to cause damage or steal.  The account was left relatively untouched and I managed to recover all the Bitcoins.
I have a feeling somebody who didn't really understand Bitcoin stumbled onto it and didn't know what they were dealing with.  Quite possibly somebody who didn't have a Bitcoin address to withdraw to (or was in the process of googling terms, and downloading Bitcoin-qt and the blockchain.)
Who knows, I'll probably never know.  One hell of a bullet dodged though.

Yeah I think 1700 was traded in that 15 minute candle.  The position was 1280 BTC long I think or something like that.  I had been knife-catching for a couple of weeks and was getting too stressed about it.
@_date: 2014-10-19 09:56:24
Thanks, this has really made me think a lot more about securing my coins.  The only issue is that if you want to margin trade you've got limited options.  Maybe the answer is "don't margin trade" :)
@_date: 2014-10-19 20:07:46
I'm not a very vengeful person and I have a lot going on right now.  It doesn't seem like a positive use of my time.  Also, an experience like this is probably going to help prevent me losing all my Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-10-19 09:40:25
I had factory reset it to try and fix it.  Then because I was trading I re-added Google Authenticator after the reset, just so I didn't have to borrow my wife's phone.  Then I sent it to the repair shop.
He probably disabled 2FA on Bitfinex so he could log in from home without the device.

You could create something like this using Ethereum.  * ducks *
@_date: 2014-10-19 09:31:27
Yeah I don't want to pursue anything, I'd just like to have confirmation that the breach happened because of the phone repair, and there's not some keylogger on my laptop.
Occam's Razor tells me that it's probably due to the fact I sent a working phone with my email and 2FA details to a company full of Internet-savvy mobile phone engineers.
