I don't use the same password everywhere, fortunately. there was one similar BTC account which is intact, since changed. slowly working my way through all other accounts.

did I say it is BTC-e's fault? I think that much is unclear. It does not seem like someone logged into the account - i would have gotten an email confirming the login. wondering if someone compromised them directly.

did not have 2FA. email does not appear to be compromised. what is unusual is that i can't find any record of email login alerts prior to the hack, but they started afterwards. makes me wonder if btc-e noticed unusual activity, then activated email alerts.

what's the orchestration? I've been trading there without incident for two months. running 24 hours. I'm trying to see if others have had their accounts hacked as well. all BTC gone from my account.

thanks for the great tip. i checked my gmail account - looks like there was a "passed a sign in challenge" event from Germany, yesterday. i'm in the US.
wondering how the heck this would have happened - did they guess the gmail account, find btc-e info in there? or reverse-engineer from a btc-e account known to lack 2FA?
for all the web services i've signed up for over the years, i've literally never been hacked. 
I guess the key will be how BTC-e support team responds at this point.

had an account on kickstarter but under a different email - not linked.

no API keys created - i think my gmail account was compromised. has a successful password challenge from germany. WTF. 
for all the amazing things one can find on google, i can't find what the definition of "passed a successful challenge" is for gmail, using google.
