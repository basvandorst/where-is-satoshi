I genuinely don't understand why people would go on subreddits just to pick fights and spread hate, but whatever!

Good! They can pay the whole bill in Bitcoin and I'll turn in my own fiat to the restaurant at the end of the night. No biggy.

I will acquire enough miles to get to the moon. Once there, I will put up the Bitcoin flag and be sure to post that it finally happened.

A lot of people seem to be thinking way too deep into these stickers.  Most likely, no one will come to me trying to spend their bitcoins. If anything, these stickers will simply cause a conversation about cryptocurrency. My managers are level-headed people, so don't worry about me losing my job or something.

Responsibility would lay on the server at that point. Not the guest. The server would be written up for "cash mishandling" if cash is lost.

Na man. Blockchain.

I'm the only one doing this at the restaurant, so I don't think a mix up is much of a concern. It would be pretty cool if all the servers had these though! I like the idea. Sure, a lot of people may not use Bitcoin, but the QR codes are a cool conversation starter, and a possible tool for educating people.

Thanks man! I was surprised at all the pessimistic people that posted

Please try to communicate a little nicer.
Edit: Downvotes?! Fuck it then, be mean!

Sounds like a great opportunity to get the other servers involved in Bitcoin! ... or just give them fiat. No biggy.

Solar panels would be a nice touch.

This needs to be in the sidebar.

It's a shame people have this kind of mentality. What's even scarier is the amount of powerful people in our world with these warped mentalities. On the plus side, you mentioned troll and I thought of [this]( video that makes me crack up whenever I watch it.

Hah, thanks for looking out buddy.

Good luck with what exactly? I'm simply offering my tables another option of payment. If they want to pay in bitcoin, cool! If not, who cares? No need for your negativity.

Thanks for not pooping on my idea. Seriously, I started to lose faith in this community with everyone telling me all this negative stuff about using stickers. Where I work *is* unfortunately a corporate place, and it's possible management won't like this idea. The stickers are more of a conversation starter, however. I see no harm in accepting Bitcoins for mere tips. I could understand an entire payment for a bill may cause concern of the company. It's no different than someone leaving me a Canadian dollar on the table or a "Do you know Jesus," pamphlet as a tip. Let's be honest, it isn't going to happen enough to raise any concerns.
I only served one table where I got into conversation about Bitcoin, and it's actually what gave me this idea. I don't think there is a current market in my area, which is why I would like people to see the QR code and start asking questions.

Lots of haters on this sub for some reason. Do something with Bitcoin and you'll get attacked for doing it the wrong way. I think it's a pretty cool present idea for someone interested in tech stuff and freedom. Would love some bitcoins for my birthday, but I'm the only one I know that's into it really.
