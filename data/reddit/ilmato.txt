I bought ads and a burger last month... technically I shouldn't have lol but I still was able to do it and im pretty confident im not alone. I also work  with a website selling giftcards and digital codes, they been selling in BTC for years now and business still booming for them

Premined token that is centralized and offers no real value and on top of that they do an ICO!! lolol shiiiiiit coin!!

Most alts for sure, there are still a handful that are promising in my opinion. There has to be good stuff among all the crap when you open a pandora box of innovation the size of blockchain.
I mean, the internet revolution did not only produce google, FB and Amazon after all!

If bitcoin can do (or will be able to do) what you claim your token can to do then.... you is a shitcoin my friend!
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:38:05
Think it will still be a useful testing group for future upgrades... or so I hope \^\^
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:34:31


like the main reason I would not consider it a shitcoin is because is both supportive of BTC and good testing grounds for BTC's development :)

What if this time is different? Like you can't fool all the people all the time, those projects that have been working on their products and partnerships during the bear market and got their marketing down will be the ones to shine.... sadly there is a lot of new people in the game so probably even scam projects with good marketing will do well.  
Regardless, keep your BTC and do your own research! There are gems among all the shit the last ICO fever created. Time to find them before they take off!

I might actually agree that litcoin could be considered a non-shit coin hehehe Im still holding on to mine!
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:42:25
The people behind it are definitely not like others! LTC was helpful during lighting network implementation! I still like the idea LTC can be the experimental lil brother of BTC, trying to implement something big accross the entire BTC infrastructure can be more complex than trying it out on LTC first. Hope they remain like this
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:40:32
Hope I will not lose my friend! Like luckily I got most of my LTC under the 50 USD mark.... still pretty safu for now and im in no rush to sell. 2020 tiss the year we will all rejoice!
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:42:50
Wow dude! Like thanks man! Now im certainly more than curious as to how you did this witchraft! I will learn and give back just like I received today, I'm truly appreciative of this :)  
Guess all this time spent making memes over the years has finally paid hahahah you give me a new sence of hope and meaning XD  
You made my day man, thanks a lot!

I think there are plenty of shitcoins within the top 100. If BTC can do what you claim your token can do then it's a shitcoin and BTC will be able to do a lot once smart contracts and other capabilities get developed properly on top of the BTC infrastructure.
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:58:28
Im pretty ripped already XD
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:49:44
This certainly puts it at the top of the scale of shitcoins lol pre-mined shitcoins that do ICOs lolol bunch of scammers
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:38:49
Yes I agree with this, by definition... technically a shit coin, but at a good one at that!
@_date: 2019-07-11 09:25:30
Are you saying Im REKTD now? XD
@_date: 2019-07-12 05:48:44
I like some of the lending financial solution tokens (those that are well funded and partners with SEC regulated companies) since they do offer an amazing product to all those unbaked folk of the world! 
AGI in particular is one of my favorites, AI is the next big thing and decentralizing artificial intelligence for all humans is something im absolutely fascinated by. Definitely support their vision 100% and its truly unique and their team is the top of the industry. Like visionary sci-fi stuff lol I live for this ^^
Maybe that one token that made an awesome browser (I use it daily and its freaken good) so definitely behind this one
and like that's pretty much it! lolol maybe some of the exchange tokens since they do have a platform working product and offer functionality and usability for traders which I also use daily....
Can't really think of others.... ICOs are a bunch of shit scam money grab projects.
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:37:33
well if its not BTC tiss a shitcoin hehehhe not to say there aren't crypto projects that are actually useful (AGI comes at the top of my list, benevolent decentralized AI is something humanity needs) but by definition, I would say LTC is an altcoin... even though it's a good alt! Supportive of BTC and also useful as testing grounds for BTC.   
So yea, that's where my doubtful language comes from, I reckon its understandable no?
@_date: 2019-07-11 08:59:05
Facts lolol
@_date: 2019-07-11 10:08:36
Gotta learn the hard way indeed! That said, I do still trade and have some shitcoins myself... but I take the blows fully understanding the consequences of my actions lol REKTD!
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:44:51
Don't get me wrong, I got my favorite alts..... but 99% of them need to die and let the good one flourish still a lot of crap left to clean out in the industry before the diamonds finally get to shine
@_date: 2019-03-18 10:26:49
Ahhh damn! Didnt noticed until yesterday lol guess im a bit late to the party but happy non the less! Thank you for the clarification guys :)
@_date: 2019-10-07 07:15:50
Sick of corruption lolol man taxis are the corruption and thailand is not sick of it.... don't get me wrong, love seeing BTC adoption anywhere! But they are not doing this to fight corruption let me tell you that!

How about Exodus wallet? Is very user-friendly and the UI is very good, it also allows to store more than just Bitcoin. I use it since it allows me to also store DASH and Ether. 
I like your answer, the top one seems a bit intense, asking for help is not you being a victim. Treating people as inferiors for lack of knowledge is counterproductive to mass adoption, which is what we are all going for, isn't it? 
I mean, I do respect the revolutionary force behind those statements,  and they are true at the end of the day, but let's try to remain useful and pleasant. I think is better in the long term :)
You should definitely think about a hardware wallet at some point! I  live in the South East Aisa and the official supplier for the nano ledger said it will back in stock in about a month... so I am waiting for the real deal :)
