I see. So my EPS will be running from different system using a different network. In that case, do I need to set up my other system that has EPS as a server? It is currently just running as a mining rig. 
So there are few things I have tried before replying. I looked up window's ip config to find the IPv4 address and input that but it did not work. I also input the IP address that is listed on EPS command prompt "xxx.x.x.x", 50002. but when I open my electrum wallet, it does not give me that green light to say that I am connected. 
So I will use both of the setconfig commands right? 
**./Electrum setconfig server "myip(after i figure it out):50002:s"**
**./Electrum setconfig oneserver true**

When I did the 0.0.0.0 setting I was using the same local network. The windows is connected to the router via ethernet cable, and I connected the mac on the same router that the ethernet cable is connected to via wifi, unless I need the mac to be on ethernet cable too? 
I see. That quite a bit of step, which I am not going to attempt right now but I will look further into what you wrote and figure it out gradually. But thank you for giving me a guideline what I should expect to do.

OMG!!!! IT WORKED FINALLY!!! After this long process. Thank you so much!!!! I realized there are some language/internet jargons that I need to familiarize myself more when doing this kind of stuff. But I got it working now!!! Thank you so much!!! 
Next, I will attempt on installing the lighting network. Hopefully, it is not as difficult. 
So then a few questions just popped in my mind. Do people who have this Electrum to EPS setup only open the programs when they need to transfer BTC? Or EPS is always on while Electrum is only opened when it is needed? 
For the "port forwarding" method, will that work when you are in a different location too? Or its just specifically between two different networks that been set up using port forwarding? And do I find the REAL public IP on the gateway website? 
I will definitely look into SSL certificate before doing port forwarding. 
Thank you again helping me complete this EPS setup!!!

Woahh!! Programming since the 80's! That is a long time. So then you have witness the raise and fall of compaq computers and other tech innovations! I feel so lucky that I got help from such an experienced person!!! Thank you!!! You are my teacher! Lol Out of curiosity, during that 80s time. Would you have imagined that someone would invent bitcoin? Or decentralized applications.
Gotcha. I actually end up setting password when I finished completed downing it for the first time. But is it ok just to keep it that password on the bitcoin core? Should I take it off? Yup I have my ledger connected with Electrum.
Understood. When you say I won't see any information in the wallet meaning the incoming  bitcoin right? Also I won't lose my privacy when I am receiving without opening Electrum? I only lose privacy when I just directly tx from ledger to another wallet without connecting to Electrum (sending out) but for receiving is ok?
Thank you again and I hope you had a great forth of July and a fabulous weekend!
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:47:11
But I thought that is why lighting network was created? To lower the fees? Or is that still not enough?
@_date: 2019-07-02 06:20:52
I know! I had to take some time off after staring at the screen for so long. lol 
Got it. I think I will attempt port forwarding few weeks later, when my schedule clears up a bit. Thank you for the detail information. I feel like you make everything so easy to understand! Thank you!
Out of curiosity how are you so knowledgeable on these topic? Do you do IT or something? I would like to familiarize myself more. Are there like books or classes that you know I can read to take to learn from. 
Also I had few question that came up to my mind after setting everything up. Do you change any setting for the bitcoin core? Like encrypt password, or anything in the setting. I read about the tor part that was on the bonus guide. I did that. On top of running my paid vpn service. 
 Also, will I still be able to use the btc address that is linked to electrum when it is offline? For example, I am not connected to internet but someone wants to transfer to the address. (This part I am pretty certain it will work) But what if I want to do tx but can't get to a my computer and connect to Electrum, can I still just tx without opening Electrum, and sync after I get home? Or will that mess things up? If I am able to tx without Electrum, then I assume it will be the same process just tx from ledger but can not set the fees or use Electrum features. 
Thank you so much again!!!

So I wanted to see if I can get the connection established by just doing the same network method by using same internet by still different computers. I changed the host=0.0.0.0 part and did this  
**./Electrum setconfig server "0.0.0.0:50002:s"**
I opened the Electrum app connecting to ledger, but it is not connecting. It has red dot on the lower right corner. And EPS is just showing listening to wallet on ('0.0.0.0', 50002)

Current for my setup the EPS, Bitcoin core, and mining rig are both running in the same system which is windows. I called it mining rig but I should have specified more that it was selling hash power, so I had to download bitcoin core. Bitcoin core just finished downloading today, so I have set that up with EPS using this [github guide]( so my EPS is listening for electrum wallet. 
The windows that have all of this setup is connected to a different network to my main laptop (mac), which I want to run my electrum wallet from. They are both in the same location meaning physical accessible but the network provider that window uses has bigger bandwidth, while my mac is connected to my personal network provider that is limited in bandwidth. But in the near future, the windows will not be physically accessible soon, since it will be set up different place. 
I see, so since the even if I change the host to [0.0.0.0]( it will not let my mac connect to the EPS that is on windows because they are connected to a different network? If I were to make that connection between EPS to Electurm via the internet, then I will probably need to set the windows to a server? 
Thank you so much for helping!! I would not be able to get this far without your help seriously!!!

No worries! I hope its all good now!
How interesting. I actually came across a podcast about compaq computer awhile ago, not sure if you would be interested in listening to it but here is the [link.]( The channel is called how I built this.
The password on bitcoin is fine I think. ~~However, just today, the electrum stop making a connection with the EPS. I updated the electrum to the lastest version today, and double checked the EPS is "Listening for Electrum Wallet on ('~~[~~0.0.0.0~~]( 50002)" (And using the same internet connection)~~
~~I checked my electrum network and its set to localhost port 50002. I wonder if I need to reinstall the older version? I also did the setconfig for localhost that you previously showed me before but no luck.~~
Edit - I solved it by re-reading your comments and re-thinking. I knew the answer was right here, but for some reason, I was in some brain fog that I could not get through. 
However, I do have another question in regarding sending and receiving bitcoin now. From now on do I use the address that is on the ledger live? or I use the electrum address?
Thank you!

Thank you for the article link! I actually used that initially, that is why I was typing open Electrum.app after cd application/electrum.app/ and did the drag and drop method too. But the drop and drop method and the current method we are on takes us to a different place.
So I did
**cd desktop/Electrum.app/Contents/MacOS/**
**ls -lsa**
and got this:
**total 65304**
**0 drwxr-xr-x@ 3 myusername 102 May 16 10:17 .**
**0 drwxr-xr-x@ 7 myusername  238 May 16 10:17 ..**
**65304 -rwxr-xr-x@ 1 myusername 33433264 May 16 10:17 Electrum**
and did this:
**./Electrum --server "localhost:50002:s" --oneserver**
The Electrum wallet OPENED finally!!!! And it did what it was suppose.
Thank you so much!!!!! I really appreciate it!!!
So from now on when I open electrum do I have to run the line
**./Electrum --server "localhost:50002:s" --oneserver**
all the time? Or its permanent already?
Thank you again!!!

Ah! I see. I was trying to go in order of that guide, but I do see that extra option after connecting electrum to my hardwallet. Where will I add the --oneserver? In the network dialog option? Or the terminal? Will I add --oneserver after or before --server "localhost:50002:s" if it is on the network dialog option.
I tried the terminal commands but I could not figure it out. After inputting: open option Electrum --server "localhost:50002:s"
It showed me list of options: -a, -b, -e with explanations. I tried different combo that listed on there but could not get it to work. It also said that '--server' is unrecognized option, so I am guessing maybe --server is not the right terminal line? But I tried googling what is the equivalent terminal line for it but nothing came up.  So I am not sure. I also put the Electrum software on desktop as suggested and change the terminal path to destop but same results.
But you said that I do not need that terminal step right? So I can just use the dialog option and add the --oneserver then I will be good for setting up the hardwallet and electrum part?
Thank you for taking your time to answer my post!
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:38:48
Thank you for the input! I will look into them. But can't I create them when I open the Electrum app installation? There is a portion where I can choose if it is bech32 or m/49/0/0/0/. etc. or are those something different? 
And how do I check on the mempool fee? My understanding of fee is that its expensive right now because there are a lot of transactions are going on. Is there a website that I can check and learn more?
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:27:22


So I tried the: ls -lsa command and found out that it was  **Electrum.app.** and I did the following:
***cd desktop/***
***Electrum.app --server "localhost:50002:s" --oneserver***
However, I still got the ***-bash: Electrum: command not found*** message... So I am not sure what I am doing wrong...
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:21:51
I checked the website. If I understand the graph correctly, if area under the histogram graph is small then fees will be low and transaction time will be fast? 
I am slightly confused about what the colors data set that indicates when I hover over the chart. I read the description on the bottom saying that it is colored in different fee levels. This is a [screenshot]( that I just took. So 300+ is saying there are 300+ satoshi or btc waiting to be confirmed or that is how much it will cost? 38 tx = 38 transactions waiting to be confirmed?
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:00:38
This is a noob question but if I am running a VPN software then will I use my vpn IP address or my computer IP address for the electrum wallet? 
Thank you in advance.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:10:20
OMG u/jcoinner you are a trooper!!! thank you for helping with my other post and replying to this one too!!!! I really appreciate your time and answers!!!
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:34:54
Cool! Thank you for the input! I was thinking I wanted to have it all in one address but I think I will make two separate addresses now. Bech32 is an experimental feature for ledger at the moment but I just tried it and use that to make another address within ledger to test it out. 
For wallet features do you set edit fees manually? And are there any settings that I should set? How about the coin control on the bitcore? I don't do many txs. It is mostly receiving, but I just want to have it optimal settings when I do send coins out. 
thank you!
@_date: 2019-06-28 04:48:09
So I copied what you suggested and did this:
**cd desktop/**
**./Electrum.app --server "localhost:50002:s" --oneserver**
Then I got this right after:
**-bash: ./Electrum.app: is a directory**
Did it work?
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:13:32
I just tried those, and it says no such file or directory. So I added those command lines after /Applications/Electrum.app but it is /Applications/Electrum.app is a directory, which is what I been getting before too.
@_date: 2019-06-30 20:06:07
Ok. I will attempt to set this up once my bitcoin core finish synching, and have my electrum personal server up. And use the setconfig command method, since that seems easier.
For the server ip address do I use the IPv4 address? The server IP address will be from windows so I can just do **ipconfig /all** to display the address right? 
Wait where do I input?
**"oneserver": true,**
 **"server": "192.168.0.1:50002:s",**
Is it after?
**./Electrum setconfig server "localhost:50002:s"** 
**./Electrum setconfig oneserver true**
@_date: 2019-06-28 19:03:19
Thank you so much for helping! I really appreciate it! 
So I went further as you suggested. Did the following:
**cd desktop/**
**cd** **Electrum.app/**
**ls -lsa**
And I got this:
**total 0**
**0 drwxr-xr-x@ 3 (my username) staff  102 May 16 10:17 .**
**0 drwx------+ 46 (my username) staff 1564 Jun 28 10:48 ..**
**0 drwxr-xr-x@ 7 (my username) staff  238 May 16 10:17 Contents**
not sure what this means. I replaced the part that said (my username part) since it was showing my username.
@_date: 2019-06-27 03:09:47
Sorry for the confusion. So first in the terminal, I typed:
***cd desktop/***
follow by:
***Electrum --server "localhost:50002:s" --oneserver***
Then I get this message immediately after:
***-bash: Electrum: command not found***
And I have Electrum app on the desktop.
Thank you for helping!!! I really appreciate it!
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:22:39
I see. So I just did the cd command: 
**cd desktop/Electrum.app/Contents**
**ls -lsa**
after that I got this
 
**0 drwxr-xr-x@ 7 myusername 238 May 16 10:17 .**
**0 drwxr-xr-x@ 3 myusername   102 May 16 10:17 ..**
**0 drwxr-xr-x@ 2 myusername 68 May 16 10:17 Frameworks**
**8 -rw-r--r--@ 1 myusername 1005 May 16 10:17 Info.plist**
**0 drwxr-xr-x@ 3 myusername  102 May 16 10:17 MacOS**
**0 drwxr-xr-x@ 3 myusername  102 May 16 10:17 Resources**
**0 drwxr-xr-x@ 3 myusername  102 May 16 10:17 \_CodeSignature**
so I am guessing I need to further cd?
