This is the best logic so far. It's cpherent visual language. If obly it did not look so much like a dollar I would be super satisfied.

Screwing everybody you know, a lot of people who trust you and sabotaging the image of a market. If it's true, this guy should get life instead of death.

Interesting facts, really, but the combined symbols still look very weak typographically though. Especially so when applied small. And the hostile takeover of a symbol by the USA does not mean it still is the way to go. Different times.
The USA does a lot of things which are not the way to go.

Think of small use. It won't work in fonts. It also has the tail ánd the dollar stripes. 2 different style elements is too much.

Well you say it like it is a fact while it is not. The at and dollar option looks tacky. Furthermore it looks unbalanced and the tail on the other side feels off. Then there is the fact that there is too much going on. A simple S with bars? OK. an S with a tail? Maybe ok if executed better. Both? Cheap, tio complex fir what it should be. 
The trick with powerful symbols for practical use is simplicity, while being unique.
Edit: for print it would be horrible too. The bars on the s get way too close to the tail. On smaller use the symbol would look even less robust.
Edit 2: it also looks too much like dollar. That's not universal for money, but American money. Should it not have it's own symbol that's less like a dollar? Are we not trying to "get rid" of dollars here anyway?

Well that's not necessary
