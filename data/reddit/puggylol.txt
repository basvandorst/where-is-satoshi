I considered that, but didnt say it because the guys trying to convince his girlfriend.. I thought that might hurt his case.. Haha

Think his point is he has over a hundred thousand dollars worth of bitcoins
@_date: 2019-07-01 03:42:32

Its decentralized.. So no "man" has the authority.. It isnt an american thing. It isn't a Russian thing.. Its ran from every country yet no country.

I could go get a bank account.. Im just trying to do this like now...

Yea I tried jubiter.. Everything seemed fine then i got a text that my card was declined
@_date: 2019-08-25 04:02:29
I dunno the info. I got it from my job and ny boss just gave me the card. I have no info along with it
@_date: 2019-08-25 04:18:28
I'm using the crypto app.. Says its gonna takr 2-3 days to be verified.. Pretty annoying everything bitcoin related takes multiple days.. I hoped to just enter my info n buy the shit like anything else
@_date: 2019-06-25 21:17:32
Ok. Thanks

Am i missing the point of this? Bitcoin hasnt been around since the 1980.. Check back in when bitcoins abouy 40 years old
@_date: 2019-09-09 23:52:31
Also.. How would I go about buying bitcoin direcrly from someone... Obviously they arnt going to give me the coins b4 I pay.. But I'm not gonna pay because they can take my money and not give me the coins..
