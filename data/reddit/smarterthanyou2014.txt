Remember, bitcoins are meant to be dumped on greater fools, the pump (websites "accepting" it, ATMs, conferences) is just fluff! You got conned, time to move on.

Too bad that's a lie. You can't use the bitcoin network to send dollars, you can only use it to send bitcoins. Which need to be converted into real money on both ends, for a fee (and incurring exchange risk AND third party risk). Therefore, those transaction costs (which, btw, are currently being subsidized with bitcoin inflation) are completely bogus. Andreas is a fucking sleazebag. He is full of shit, and you guys eat it all up.
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:47:42
Nice. Find a tenuous correlation in a very small set of data, and then imply causation. You represent the typical bitcoiner: dumb as a doorknob, and yet full of certainties. Perfect poster boys for the Dunning–Kruger effect :D

"I have been evangelizing my friends" - I'm sure they are always happy to see you.    
"How could he do so in a cost-effective and simple manner" - I don't know, you're the evangelist. You should know the scam, I mean product, you're trying to sell better. If you did, you'd know your friend will WASTE MONEY if he does what you're telling him to do. But you only care about pumping, you little weasel.

- compares bitcoin to oil;    
- mentions the banking crysis, when uninsured deposits over €100k were confiscated... but forgets to mention deposits on NeoBee have ZERO insurance (with no minimum threshold);    
- spreads FUD that insured deposits will be confiscated next, with no basis in reality, but forgets to mention buying bitcoins implies trading real money for a bunch of bits held in a beta system being maintained by a couple of programmers, whose power is centralized in the hands of shady exchanges and mining pools;    
- calls himself "the CEO of the largest business in the world that is building infrastructure around the Bitcoin technology", exhibiting clear signs of delusion of grandeur;    
- "the release from the Chinese Central Bank, was heavily misinterpreted and this resulted in a temporary drop in the exchange rate of Bitcoin, which today is again approaching $1,000." LOL    
- "we will be adding significant liquidity to the global Bitcoin market through developing our subsidiaries to utilize the benefits of this technology, thus naturally increasing demand of which we project to have a positive influence on the exchange rate." ELI5: we will use our customers money to pump the price, that's our whole business model, everything else is fluff;    
- "the Bitcoin technology brings with it inherent characteristics that make it a less than desirable medium for money laundering. The publicly distributed ledger of every transaction that has ever occurred on the network ensures this ledger cannot be altered nor deleted once a transaction has been verified by the network." Exhibits signs of Alzheimer, by "forgetting" to mention tumblers;    
- seems to be scared he might get thirsty in hot summers;    
- "bitcoin developers convinced everyone to discard the fork containing the supposedly invalid block ... Previous occurrence of a hard fork demonstrated the openness and the ability of the Bitcoin community as a whole to address issues in a timely manner" I.e., bitcoin is a distributed system, but someone is still in charge; if the developers and the main mining pools decide to change the rules, they will, and the "investors" get the middle finger;    
- "when a customer purchases bitcoins with Euros, the Euros are immediately converted into Bitcoins and held in full reserve off the Neo balance sheet." Guess what happens when bitcoin crashes again... Bye bye euros! This business is 100% GUARANTEED to go bankrupt sooner or later, as it will be chasing the price up until it crashes.    
- finishes describing a bunch of "services" that will never see the light of day.

But bitcoin sucks for micropayments. They would DDOS the network in seconds. What's that, you want to handle micropayments outside the blockchain? Creating centralized failure points in your decentralized system? Isn't that against everything bitcoiners stand for? Let me repeat: THE BITCOIN NETWORK CANNOT HANDLE MICROPAYMENTS.

You were warned many times, you bozos... Danny is long gone. Time for  LOL
@_date: 2014-04-02 17:28:22
Danny has left the building. "Investors" get the shaft. Goodness, who could see this coming?!?!?!    
    
...    
    
When this idiot first came out with his joke of a "business plan" on bitcointalk, asking for "investment" money, I and some other poster made FUCKING CLEAR this would never go anywhere, cause his main source of revenue was 100% illegal. Of course, we got called trolls by all the geniuses in the forum. Time went by, and of course the initial "business plan" had to change, different vaporware sources of income were created, and they even opened a store that doesn't sell anything (it's merely for propaganda). Danny is now rich, and gone. You were all his meal ticket.    
Obligatory: I TOLD YOU SO! Next time maybe "investors" should keep an open mind, and listen to what the "trolls" that have decades of financial experience tell them. I posted this 6 months ago, when he first started requesting funds:    
    
"There're 2 options here: either Mr. Banker is a scammer, and plans on running with the 'shareholders' funds as soon as he gets the chance... Or he is retarded enough to think that he'd be able to pull off these numerous financial crimes in a EU country without being shutdown in minutes. Sadly, I believe option number 2 is the most likely. Regardless, don't be sad for him, he'll still have a few million in real money when it all comes crashing down. It pays to be retarded in the buttcoin world (until it doesn't)." (full comment in  by "LOL WHAT?")    
    
Of course, many "investors" will remain affected by Stockholm syndrome, and won't ever be able to process the butt fucking they received from Danny. Congratulations all, you just made a humongous idiot rich.    
    
PS1. If you missed this opportunity for a paid butt raping don't despair, still plenty of opportunities to lose your money in the Bitcoin world. Greater fools everywhere!    
PS2. I think it's appropriate to remind you your cult leader Andreas Antonopoulos was also getting a check from Danny hehehe So you actually made 2 humongous idiots rich ;)

bitcoin solves the problem of allowing the easy distinction between brainless people and regular people.

"I would watch it go to zero before I sold a single Satoshi" - and this is why pigs get slaughtered. Whenever you hear a bitcoiner saying he made 1000% profit, keep in mind those are paper profits; they need to sell for real cash to other fools (which could crash the price in this illiquid market), or buy a ton of rugs on overstock. But most won't, they'll just wait for zero again, and maybe jump off a building after. Which is fine, it's just natural selection removing the stupid from the gene pool.

And you think there are many people like you out there, willing to spend more money to pay for their bills (cause you have to pay fees to trade your dollars for bitcoin), just so big companies can make more money! So noble! I'm sure everyone will join you on this fight to make companies more profitable at your own expense! This isn't a pump &amp; dump, no way! It's a selfless act! Goodness, won't anyone think of the big companies? :'( Moron.

Oh noes, someone is trying to steal the thunder of your pump-and-dump by pumping a different, yet, similar, pump-and-dump. It's like there's no real value underlying your bitcoins, except the misguided trust of a bunch of dumb "investors", and that trust needs to be cherished and protected against competing pyramids of foolishness. Keep fighting the good fight, my man.
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:24:17
Genius, savvy, expert. You are a brilliant brilliant man. So smart. I'm really impressed. A master of investment, economics and history. Thank you for gracing us with you contribution! (just kidding, this is actually Dunning–Kruger in full effect - if you ever want an easy laugh, just ask a bitcoiner about investment!)
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:45:25
Another pumper talking his book. It's so great to watch his bitcoin virtual fortune turn into nothingness... No, no one wants to give him real money for his useless tokens that are backed by greed and ignorance. Except for the oblivious idiots from of course! LOL
@_date: 2014-03-22 15:03:43
Yes, like all revolutionary technologies, bitcoin will need lots of propaganda. It is so useful and amazing that you have to beg people to buy it. Close your eyes, bitcoiners, it will all be over soon. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 04:04:13
"even though I have supported him in the past if he continued his attack on BTC I would be forced to do everything I could to support anyone who runs against him in future elections" - I'm sure he won't even sleep tonight because of this threat! LOL You're a fucking idiot. No one wants to be a part of your get-poor-quick scheme, you sleazebag, give it a rest. I'm sure you already got all your family buying this shit, and now they are breathing down your neck as the price goes down the toilet. Don't worry, it will get much worse. 
@_date: 2014-03-14 23:50:55

Oh you silly willy, don't hurt your brain thinking so far ahead. Bitcoin will cross that bridge when it gets there (i.e., never). I only read the first few lines of your post, it was enough to know the amount of dumb would only increase from there. May I recommend reading a book or ten?

awwwwwww thought you were gonna get rich out of this scam?  
@_date: 2014-03-20 02:38:06
No, bitcoin is getting a lot of push back because it's useless to the common Joe, and its only purpose is to be sold to great fools. No one wants them, except a bunch of Dunning–Kruger affected morons that want to get rich off of other people. But they are shit out of luck, cause all the fools are already in!    
@_date: 2014-03-15 16:00:22
LOL, TL/DR, but I sense the cult mantra is strong with this one. Such tasty Kool-Aid. I heard bitcoin cures AIDS now... If only it cured stupid, you guys could make good use of it!
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:39:56
The small problem with your perfect plan is that no one wants to be paid in bitcoins, except for a few idiot zealots. So keep dreaming. But don't look at the price action, or you'll be having nightmares :D 
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:03:52
Their entire business model is basically "bitcoin can never crash", so here's a spoiler: they will be bankrupt sooner or later. "Investing" in bitcoin is dumb... But "investing" in Neo Bee is even worse. Of course, that won't stop the astute "investors" in Bitcoinland from burning their money with this idiot Danny Brewster. In his defense, he isn't a scammer, he's just dumb as a doorknob. And so are his "investors". Makes for great comedy though!
@_date: 2014-04-01 16:52:55
You were warned many times, you bozos... Danny is long gone. Time for  LOL
@_date: 2014-03-22 21:09:11
Because bitcoin is useless. It's nothing but a pump &amp; dump, and you're in the dump phase now. It will get worse. You're welcome!
@_date: 2014-03-20 10:27:38
"We need more propaganda to trick more fools, cause the price is circling the drain!" LOL    
@_date: 2014-03-22 15:29:56
It doesn't matter who supports bitcoin, it will still be useless to the common Joe. So keep dreaming, while the "value" of your bitcoins goes "TO THE EARTH CORE"! Sweet schadenfreude! :D

I have no idea what mpe is, but one thing I do know: I don't have your money, it's in Danny's pocket! hahaha And yet you keep defending him from all the meanies on the internet, you clueless idiot!    
Try this, it might help:  LOL
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:37:25
Maybe if you cry and beg more? hehehe don't worry, when bitcoin goes to shit there won't be anything to tax :D It should all be over soon.
@_date: 2014-03-18 14:51:22
It's ok, only bitcoins were stolen. No actual money was lost, only virtual tokens.
@_date: 2014-03-21 03:52:01
Those Colombian drug lords sure could use something like bitcoin to smuggle their money. Too bad bitcoin is too shitty even for that, due to all the price volatility, stemming from the fact that it's value is based on the trust of a bunch of neckbeard gamblers.

Bitcoin will fail because it's useless. And you are a know-nothing idiot. Cry more, bitch.  LOL
@_date: 2014-03-16 15:53:34
Cause no one cares about it? Current bag holders are waiting for greater fools, but there are none to be found? Bitcoin has absolutely zero usefulness for the common Joe, so unless you can find a new group of depraved gamblers like the Chinese, this scheme has run its course. Sorry for your loss.

Tell that lowlife to convert his shitcoins into real money, and then pay your parents every month. Why would that idiot expect your parents to go through that trouble? Would they allow him to pay the rent in bananas? (bad comparison, I know, bananas are a real asset, not a useless virtual token that won't be around much longer)
@_date: 2014-03-13 14:10:53
People haven't agreed it has value... A few idiots did. And they are happy to trade real money for digital tokens, thinking it's their way to riches. Eventually reality will set in, and they'll end poorer than they started. And they'll blame something/someone else, it's never the fault of their own stupidity/greed.
@_date: 2014-03-15 15:15:01
LOL bitcoiners keep harassing businesses with propaganda, get the standard "fuck off" answer, and then pat themselves on the back like they accomplished something. What a bunch of bozos.
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:46:12
Big mistake: you tried to spend bitcoin. Wrong wrong wrong. Cash and credit cards are much cheaper and easier. What you need to do is buy bitcoin, then hold it till you can sell it to another sucker for millions. The problem is... It seems like you guys have run out of suckers! Which makes you the sucker... :( You're the dude that gave away real money for worthless hashes. So you get to hold the bag now. Thanks for playing. On a happier note, I heard the Brooklyn bridge is for sale, maybe you can invest in that to recover your bitcoin losses. You're welcome.
@_date: 2014-03-20 10:16:39
“bitcoin is extremely unlikely to go to zero" - beanie baby prices didn't go to zero either... but they are darn close though! Can't wait for NeoBee to go down the toilet, shouldn't take long! Unfortunately, Danny already made his fortune, thanks to the idiot "investors". Fingers crossed he keeps it in bitcoin, so he can lose it all too.
@_date: 2014-03-19 19:37:20
It will stabilize near zero soon. And that's how much Matt Miller's reputation is worth, now that he has become a cheerleader for this pump &amp; dump. Not sure if he is dumb or just another greedy pig, but either way his critical thinking capability is below par. He will get canned eventually. Good riddance!
@_date: 2014-03-20 17:03:52
This Keiser idiot has got to be one of the sleaziest and most disgusting bitcoiners of the bunch. Everything about him screams MLM/ponzy scammer. He'd sell his mother for a buck. But he doesn't have to, he can sell virtual tokens to you guys for many bucks. Master pumper dumping on you, open wide!

Now they're making propaganda movies? Featuring criminals? For such an amazing, revolutionary technology, bitcoin sure is requiring a lot of peddling. This is what is called "The Pump", which is eventually followed by "The Dump". And then this "revolutionary" technology that no one needs can finally be flushed down the loo.

Dude, why are you betting something with real value (1 BRK.A share) against 300 unicorn turds? The bitcoin price is based on a flimsy illiquid market, doesn't take much to make it go up (and have all these geeks think they are rich, unknowing that if they tried to sell out for real money the price would crater). Just let them play with their monopoly money, don't gamble your real assets on this pump-and-dump scheme.

You are a master researcher, excellent analysis. Too bad you were wrong LOL Don't be sad, that's normal in Bitcoinland, you fit right in.

@_date: 2014-03-29 06:10:37
There's no question you're a loser. You're also a sleazy dirtbag trying to pump the price of your retarded "investment" so that you're not the greater fool left holding the bag. By the time bitcoin finally goes down the drain you will have no profit to show for, you stupid idiot. 
@_date: 2014-03-16 18:38:13
These assholes' greed knows no bounds. They will trick everyone they can just to try to pump this idiotic idea. If bitcoin is so great why would they need to keep begging people to buy it? They should go back to selling amway products, at least those have some practical use.
