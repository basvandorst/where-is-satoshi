Well, Coinbase users are funding this in their large currency conversion fees. Unfortunately anyone paying Coinbase fees is not too aware on whats going on with bitcoin, as they are paying those high conversion fees, which could be simply avoided by using GDAX or other exchanges.

As a GDAX user you are not really giving much to Coinbase. Users who use Coinbase main site are funding Coinbase and transaction fees. If everyone would stop using Coinbase main site and use GDAX instead, their business model would collapse.

It should be possible with lnd, but you need to locate a full node to serve your light client.
Here are instructions for testnet, so it needs some tweaking:

1) "The following order books have been created and will remain in post-only mode until there is sufficient liquidity for trading"
2) That's normal. Someone always gets to know the news before its publicly available
3) Market is not even launched yet. BCH is not tradeable yet. However I can see my credited BCH balance on GDAX
4) I got email months ago about the January launch. I'm very surprised if this info was not available via Google as it has been clearly sent to all GDAX customers

World consist of four elements, which are earth, water, air, and fire. This is the original idea. Newton and Einstein are liars, they do not follow the original idea.

This was known for a long time. I think it was supposed that they open BCH trading in January. 
This is not a bad thing for Bitcoin either. Everyone who held BTC in Coinbase on August 1st, have their equal amount of BCH now available. This means, that total amount of available BCH for trading increases and the price will likely drop.

Toucscreen is good for entering pin, but heres something that should be fixed:
- Keychain attachment. It broke down in week or something
- USB cord socket should have some kind of protection to prevent dust
- Also the case should be metal in 100+$ device

Finally! :) Nice work everyone involved!
Very intresting reading. 
Some points from the announcement what the developers are focusing on next:
* Watchtowers: No need for LND node to be always online!
* lnd-0.4 compatible mobile wallets coming soon
* Atomic Multipath Payments (AMP) - allows large Lightning transactions to be divided into a series of smaller transactions automatically

"While Bitcoin utilizes 256-bit private keys, the security of the elliptic curve is around half of the used bits, so 128 bits for the secp256k1 curve that is being used."

Cool! Now one can use Coinbase to pay directly to merchants accepting LN payments. UI looks so that is works even on mobile :) (?)
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:47:52
And btw by holding your spending funds, like worth 100€ on Coinbase there is no need to be always connected. Just open Coinbase app and send the LN payment whenever needed.

Here's an idea: Lets create a new Bitcoin fork: BitcoinFiat, which central banks can create more to control the economy. It would be extremely stable, like USD, and it would be just like our cash on our bank accounts!
But there is just one problem... why would anyone buy it? X--D
But here's another idea. Let's create pieces of paper which equal some amount of Bitcoin, and then one can carry those in his leather wallet and buy stuff with it.
My point being. If there are two currencies you can use, why would you chose the inflatory one? Only bankers want you to pick the inflatory one.

I get it that ASIC resistant algorithm might be impossible to make.
So, just a random thought: Maybe instead of trying to make ASIC resistant algorithms, try to make GPU optimized algorithm?
Eg. could PoW be achieved with what GPU does best, drawing 3D graphics and then somehow prove you have done the necessary calculations needed to draw it?

Did you check recycle bin?

Coinbase or any exchange sticking to chain that does not hold most of the market cap is just plain stupid, and any big exchange will not do that. The chain with most market cap will probably be called "Bitcoin".

Hodling tight my Bitcoins while living on student loan :D

No coz I have no fiat to buy anymore.

Well there are some good points to think about.
However, digital money is here, and it will stay. Whether we pay using Visa or Bitcoin, its all digital. And then it's up to the consumer to decide which digital currency he wants to use. Visa is still dominant, because Bitcoin is not yet good enough, but it will very likely to be as fast and simple to use as Visa, because Bitcoin is getting faster, cheaper and more popular every day. 
Only thing that can stop it is governments making it illegal to buy things with Bitcoin, but I don't see that happening.
Maybe we need automation and AI breakthrough with Bitcoin, which will increase  population wealth so much we don't need to take loans to buy houses...

Number of lightning nodes should explode soon as we start getting these mobile wallets. Waiting for something on iOS.
