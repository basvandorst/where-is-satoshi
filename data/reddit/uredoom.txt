Not 100% yet but sad to say im pretty sure there isn't, most likely it was too worrying for a kid that couldn't see the future within it and no money.

That is the thing I haven't got my hopes up as most likely i simply turned it on, sped up my fans and turned it off because i was around 13 at the time and probably got scared, once i figure things out ill update this thread.

yeah that is most likely the case!

I've got the blocks in the folder, and in the dump it says "Blocks processed" accepted etc, honestly it is hard to say, any idea if theirs some way i can check if a block was actually completed or not? as this is my main issue, I probably turned it on, Fans sped up and quit it, Im hoping I was a more ballsy kid but i doubt it.

My brothers friend who got me into it sold it in the early days, Hindsight is a beautiful yet cruel thing.

Its most likely a red herring, as ive copied over the Wallet.dat into Core and it doesn't show anything except currently syncing the blockchain, perhaps because its such an old file, will update this once
I know if its good or heart breaking!

Most likely none as i cant remember if i just turned it on to see what it was about, but will keep this thread updated, fingers crossed.

I am not a wealthy man and would be very happy with anything, will let it complete the sync and update the thread :3 thanks for the positivity!
