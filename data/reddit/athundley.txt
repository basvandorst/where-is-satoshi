OP’s question HAS been asked.  Countlessly.  “When should I invest $5?” ”$20?” ”$50?” ”$100?” etc.  this is a reoccurring theme within the last week. The answers to OP’s question have been provided and can be found with some effort on their end. They’re asking to be handheld.  Also, r/bitcoinbeginners is a thing. Questions like “When should I invest in coinbase?” are far better suited for that sub, and much more likely to be met with legitimate advice.  I can’t be the only one around here tired of memes and “I just saw this bitcoin thing on some show, how should I spend my money?”

Just bought my first bitcoin shares for $100 on Coinbase. I’m all in. Can’t wait for my Lambo. When does that happen? I can’t really afford to eat or pay rent but I’m thinking about putting in my last $5. Do you think it will be $100k per share by Christmas? I’m just here to cash out.  Who else loves Bitcoin, right? My favorite celebrity tweeted about it and my really, really smart computer-guy friend told me I should invest to get rich.  Should I sell if it drops? Is now a good time to buy? What’s a wallet? What are these “futures” things I keep reading about? Who’s this Satoshi person? Can someone just hold my hand and walk me to riches so I don’t have to research anything myself?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:43:50
Seriously?  It’s $100. Just buy now and forget about it.  Do you think you’re going to get rich or something? Fucking hell these posts are retarded.

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:58:44
It’s not an argument? These posts are just pathetic.  OP is talking about $100 here.  This hardly warrants asking whether yesterday, today, or tomorrow is the time to invest.  I get that $100 is worth more to some people than others, but as far as how $100 relates to bitcoin at any given time, is infact, the same for everyone.  If you believe in bitcoin, you believe in bitcoin. For real though....  say bitcoin hits $1,000,000 ten years from now and this scrub put in $100 at $13,000 instead of waiting for it to drop to $12,000, the difference is like ~$6-700.  ARE YOU FUCKING KIDDING ME.  If $100 is such a big deal now, than is OP really concerned whether he profits $7700, and doesn’t maximize that $100 initial investment for $8300? Seriously? Over the duration of whatever amount of time that takes?  To the OP, break out a calculator and find out how filthy fucking rich you think you want to be off $100 and do the math yourself.  Nobody here has a crystal ball, and less than that give a shit about your $100.

This is fraudulent and stupid.   Go to to school, use the loans for SCHOOL expenses. Get a job on the side and put income into crypto at appropriate intervals. For god sakes don’t take out any additional loan amounts that you do not need.  Only take out what the grants don’t cover.  Your scheme is retarded.

This is a problem you’ve put yourself in. Again, it’s like using windows XP and complaining that Microsoft won’t support it anymore. I’d bet that of Xapo’s user base, the number of customers using pre-iPhone 5 models is incredibly small. If I were calling the shots at Xapo, I too, would elect not to support those devices if they required any additional development for backwards compatibility, or posed security risks. It’s not worth it for them, you can’t blame them because they won’t support your 6 year old phone. Where would they draw the line? iPhone 3g? Original iPhone? Samsung Blackjack? BlackBerry 7100t? Moto Razer? Nokia 3310? 
It’s not them, it’s you.  Upgrade your phone

I’m guessing a lot of people fomo’d their way in around $10k hype. For them -17% on the day is a problem.  For me, I’d like to see it drop back down to a healthy ~7.5k-8k and pick up where it was pre-thanksgiving crazy train. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:09:24
Ok, fair enough. Apart from corporate motives of planned obsolescence, this situation just reminded me of some people’s incessant need to resist upgrading their ancient hardware because “it still works just fine.” So the sentiment is what made me think of the XP end of life. 
You had a good run with your iPhone 4, I still wouldn’t be upset with Xapo.

Stop looking for easy money. If you want your daughters to have a better life than you, go work for it. What happens when you sink all your savings into bitcoin and it crashes? You could put yourself, and daughters, in dire straights. This shit is so cringeworthy. People looking for “profits.”

Your target demographic is very narrow. Supreme-wearing sheeple (16-25 y/o self-conscious males), that also want to spend Bitcoin on clothing.  Good luck with that. As a business model you’re setting up for failure. Not because of the bitcoin, that’s fine, but because of the narrow focus on what’s cool right now.  IE. Von Dutch hats, ed hardy jeans, Fubu, rocawear, ecko, juicy, etc.  
Supreme will die, their brand is centered around a style.  That style will faze out. Always does.

You can specify where you want it to be allocated.  If you don’t, it goes where it’s needed most. The ARC isn’t just “those guys that show up after hurricanes.” Say you donate $1,000 to the ARC and just assume that it’s going to go to whatever disaster is in the news, and then you find out it didn’t because they have excess funds already allocated to that specific disaster.  So instead of the donated funds being utilized by Disaster Response, they go to Biomedical Services, or International Relief  or SAF, or the National Fire detection program, etc, etc. 
The Red Cross does many, many things.  God forbid the money you thought was going to the current hot news topic ends up instead, saving a pediatric cancer patient’s life, a family’s when their house burns down, or Transition Care Packs for wounded soldiers trough wounded warrior partnership, or the assistance of victims of humanitarian conflicts(and the volunteers who risk their lives in literal war zones to do so), or the measles/rubella vaccinations of literally 2 BILLION children since 2000(preventing 17.1 million childhood deaths), or the aid of 183MM people in 99 countries in fiscal year ‘16 alone, or any one of the other many things they do that you don’t see in the news. The money is going where it’s needed most and that still only happens if you don’t specify where you want it utilized 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:41:19
I did the same thing.  Tried to wait until Monday when my trezor was to be delivered.  Should’ve just coinbased it in the high 5’s. I did buy another 0.152 at 6690 though that’s appreciating quite nicely already

So bitcoin is 10,000 dollars? backed by gold? Dollars aren’t even backed by gold, haven’t been since 1971. This is confusing artwork.  Maybe just auction it on eBay for $10k like that other guy.

Regardless of the software support, you should consider upgrading anyway.  This is like the people that used(still use) winXP beyond end of life. You can get an iPhone 6 brand new for ~$150. You’re torturing yourself with whatever pre-5 iPhone you’re using and you don’t even know it. 
Objectively, if xapo only supports iPhone 5 or newer, it’s probably for the purpose of being able to provide a better product to you, the customer. If they handicap their software to be utilized by the 2% of people still using ancient devices, it detracts from the experience of the majority of their customer base.  
Sounds like they ARE putting their customers first by ensuring up to date software and security, at least the vast, vast, majority of them that use devices made after 2012.
