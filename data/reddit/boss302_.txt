Depending about the kind of bech your wallet use. For example Electrum use bech32 so the seed generate for electrum can be restore by all wallet that use bech32.
You have to know what kind of bech your wallet use.
There are many kind of bech. Bech32 it's the most used

Why Venezuelans doesn't accept directly bitcoin, without converter to Bolivars? (the government money)
Bitcoin can't never be really adopted if people think to convert to Fiat money for spent it.
Bitcoin need that shops, supermarket and other primary services beginning to accept it.

Honestly never I wrote my seed on any keyboardas.
Write it on a paper (cript it) , do more copies and store in different and safe place.
No keyboards IMHO
