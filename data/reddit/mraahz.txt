Me too, but that's not this.
They're actually charging an extra 5%-7% in order to buy these AirBnB gift cards with BTC.

If you're lying to your partner about their money you have bigger problems then them thinking you're crazy.

To either try to actually answer any of the questions asked or to ignore the post.


There's a big difference between asking for information and whining.

I agree when funds are still separate.  
But OP said "our money" meaning the "significant other's" money is being invested without their knowledge.
@_date: 2019-02-27 04:08:01
OP stated "our money", so finances are not being kept completely separate.

Yes, I understand the mempool is on the high side.  But that doesn't explain why the second transaction isn't even showing as unconfirmed, does it?  That's my ***much*** bigger concern ATM.

And, ***BOOM!*** Just that like that it's all cleared up.  45 minutes of freak out for nothing.  Just need to remember to have faith in the system.

Thanks so much for your input.  It was no help whatsoever.

What is their purpose in trying to convince you that they're satoshi?  I get people "publicly" bragging about it for either ego or trolling purposes.  I think it's a bit silly, but I can understand it.  
But are these people hoping you'll pay them or something simply because they "are" Satoshi?  Or are they trying to gain access to the site?  Or...?
