Nope. Suppose SHA256 is super broken and you can instantly find preimages. You still need to find a RIPEMD160 preimage if you want to find the public key. And even then it's just a public key. If you want to find the matching private key you still need to do 2^160 work.

Birthday Paradox doesn't apply here.
What you're referring to is a batch attack. I.e. if k/N addresses contain funds, then each guess you have a k/N chance of finding one instead of 1/N. This is different from a birthday attack where your chances increase quadratically.
But like others have said, the numbers are just too big for such an attack to be feasible. Even the private keys found by the LBC are from challenges that are intentionally weak.

It takes about 2^72 hashes to mine a block.
The most efficient miner gets about 0.098 watts per billion hashes.
So it takes 2^72 / 1 billion * 0.098 = 4.628 x 10^11 watts. That's 4.628 x 10^11 joules.
1 pound of mass contains 0.454 (2.9979 x 10^8)^2 = 4.08 x 10^16 joules of energy.
So with 1 pound of mass you have the energy to mine 88159 blocks. At the current block reward of 12.5 BitCoin that is 1101987.5 BitCoin. At current market value of $19414.10 that is **$21,394,095,523.75**.

You can either attack the public key if you have it (128-bit strength) or attack the address (160-bit strength).

Not quite. There is still 256 bits of entropy, given you've used a random 256 bit private key.
The 2^128 figure comes in because you only need to perform around 2^128 steps to break a 256 bit key (Pollard's Rho).
This doesn't make the keys themselves any less random. They are still uniformly generated from a set of ~2^256 keys.
And because of this, on average there are 2^96 keypairs for each address.

Grover's algorithm is a quantum search algorithm where the number of queries is the roughly the square root of the search space. So if the search space is 2^160 (i.e. a 160-bit address) then the algorithm requires around 2^80 queries.

Is the price of Bitcoin what determines the health of the ecosystem?
The price goes down when people sell a lot. That's how the market works. Those coins that got dumped go into the wallets of people who want Bitcoin. So in the long term this is a positive thing. Definitely much better than blacklisting coins.


The media enjoys doing whatever gets them clicks and views. It's always bad news because that's what sells.
Bitcoin's price instability is also completely separate from blockchain technology.

iUS bills are about 1 gram each. 1 gram is about 0.0022 pounds.
3 billion pounds / 0.0022 = 1,363,636,363,637 bills (rounded up)
So $136,363,636,363,700

And the public key is a function of the private key. All the attacker needs to do is test private keys until he finds one that produces a public key and address with your funds in it.

1500 watts x 24 hours x 10 cents per kWh = $3.60 per day.

Standardization of post-quantum crypto is in the works.

The idea is that mining will continue because miners collect the fees from the mined block.


I thought the mantra around here was "If you don't control the private key you don't own the coins follow these 500 steps to secure your coins". Of course that's until your coins get stolen then you'll get told what you did wrong.

I've wondered that too. It will be interesting when we have a large enough quantum computer to attack 256-bit ECC.
I'm sure there will be a Bitcoin upgrade path to post-quantum algorithms. But it will also require users to actively send the balance to their new PQ addresses.
Any address left behind could be vulnerable. There are lots of high value but dormant addresses where the public keys are known.

No you don't. You believe in waiting until the price is right for cashing out to fiat dollars.
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:57:30
No. Market cap is simply the total value of all of Bitcoins  if you wanted to buy all of them at one moment, that is what it would cost you.
*Bitcoin itself* is supposed to be a store of value.  It has some properties similar to gold like rarity and finite supply.

@_date: 2018-12-16 00:45:40
The only chance is to buy when *you* think it's a good investment. If you think Bitcoin has a future price far above what it currently is, then buy now. If not, then wait or don't buy at all.

There's absolutely nothing to suggest this though. In fact the original SHA algorithm had a vulnerability which the NSA discovered and fixed, giving us SHA-1.
The NSA doesn't seem to intentionally put weaknesses into the math itself. It's always something like a shorter keylength (e.g. DES) or a backdoor in a higher level construction (e.g. Dual EC DRBG).
@_date: 2016-07-15 15:28:25


Buyers aren't stupid. They will refuse to buy for that much. Sellers are then holding something that nobody will buy, so it's worth nothing, forcing them to lower the price to one people will pay.

The market cap is the number of Bitcoins in circulation multiplied by the price of one Bitcoin. The price per Bitcoin is how much it is being bought and sold for in the market. It sits between the bid (price people want to buy at) and the ask (price people want to sell at). The price, and thus the market cap, are always moving.
