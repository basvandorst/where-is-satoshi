Well there are other exchanges like SurBTC (now buda.com) with far more trading volume. There’s a lot of trading going on in Chile now, as well as small projects and groups of people talking about crypto.

They have been going to data management conferences and giving talks about their “Blockchain” technology. I’ve attended two (By Mohan C. Mohan and Richard Hull, two relatively important figures) and they have no idea what they are talking about. They’re trying to show they are “up to date” by using hot buzzwords, but I wouldn’t trust any of their products mentioning “Blockchain”. Also I tried to use IBM’s hyperledger, it’s complete crap and does not even do half of the things they claim.

Just to say that articles like these stigmatize South-American countries. Unlike Argentina and specially Venezuela, Chile does not have a “weak and struggling fiat currency”. The Chilean peso is very stable and Chile has a stronger economy than most people think (and arguably than some *first world* countries). Countries leading crypto adoption are naturally those with weak currencies and Chile is not amongst them (and I would argue that Colombia/Perú neither). What happened in Chile and Colombia is that banks closed the accounts of exchanges, so naturally localbitcoins’ volume increased drastically.

I am well aware you are the author, it’s just not relevant for the discussion.
Please read your replies. All at a personal level and so general that you could apply them to any discussion. It would be better if you provided some arguments on the actual topic, but you refuse to do so based on your interpretation of my underlying intentions... Anyways, most of the comments show the article is wrong in more than one way, not really worth the time discussing more about it.

Obviously the author does not understand hardware. Years and years of R&amp;D have been dedicated to generate efficient hardware to solve particular problems. So even if “your currency becomes popular enough”, people will not be able  to magically generate cheaper/more efficient hardware to solve those problems.

I’m not concerned about what you think but about facts.
“Some algorithms are designed to require more RAM to generate more hashes. All this does is prevent graphic cards from being used to mine.”
The development of high-bandwidth memory has been one of the main focus of GPU development, and when you design a hash function that is memory intensive you do it precisely to ensure that you **require** high-bandwidth memory in every compute unit to have a high hash rate. Therefore ASICS or FPGAS are compeeting against GPUs in one of GPUs main domains, where there’s been years of research. So saying that this “prevents graphic cards from being used to mine” is plain nonsense. This is in fact to ensure that it’ll very difficult to beat graphic cards. But don’t trust me, have a look at the hardware people use to mine coins that use memory-intensive hash functions.

No, no, no. You first pay with bitcoin and then sell your kidney to buy more bitcoin. This way you and the merchant have the money in btc, and you encourage the merchant to continue accepting btc. Spread the word.

Non offense taken, "interesting" is subjective.

"The fact that bitcoin itself is intact does not help much. The services overlaying bitcoin need to be secure aswell in order for bitcoin to be useful."
I don't agree here. You are implying that money is useless. Bitcoin is useful (and secure) independent of the security of the services around it.
If I understand correctly, you are basically proposing to centralize the "security of services" to so-called foundations. These foundations would not be too different from our beloved banks, basically someone you trust will not take your money away without your permission (but can do it easily). Then these foundations would be regulated by their reputation, but historically this has never worked. We already know what happens if the owners of a big service are "close" to the owners of a big foundation: in the 2-out-of-3 scheme the service and the foundation can easily colude and take away all of your money.
From my point of view in the bitcoin world this does not make sense, you should have your money or one of the required keys to take money out. Otherwise you can (and statistically you will) get fokt.
@_date: 2016-09-01 14:14:41
You can do this without the need of the lighting network or an internet connection, you only need the bitcoin protocol. Suppose that A wants to send BTC to B. The only requirement is the existence of a secured A,B-multisig transaction, a transaction that has to be signed by both A and B to be spent (notice that this original transaction can be created by anyone, not necessarily A and/or B).
Let's say that transaction T0 has 1 BTC originally payed by A, and can only be spent if both A and B sign it. If A wants to pay B 0.1BTC then she can sign an operation for dividing t0 into 2 as follows: 0.1BTC for B, and 0.9 back to herself. Then B can wait until there is an internet connection to sign this and submit it to the network. In this situation nobody needs to "monitor the blockchain" as the only way to spend the money in T0 is with both signatures.
The only case in which the network would need to be checked is if now B wants to pay A with T0, but this does not make much sense since at this point A should not trust any payment from B regarding T0. This is because B can sign the previous transaction, already signed by A, and send it to the network at any moment.
Something else that can be done without internet though (and actually is the basis of micro-payments in BTC) is for A to "increase" the payment to B using T0. For example, if A now wants to pay 0.1BTC more to B, now A can sign a new operation dividing T0 into two: 0.2BTC for B, and 0.8 back to herself. This assumes, of course, that B didn't submit the previous movement as this would mean that T0 cannot be spent anymore. In this case B has no incentive to submit the first movement, as she would only receive 0.1BTC. Then the first signature of A is disregarded.
To wrap up: if T0 is an A,B-multisig transaction, then it can be used to pay offline many times (without exceeding the money in T0), but only only in one direction, from A to B or from B to A. There is no refund :)

Hehe it's not on purpose, I really didn't get your point because to me Bitcoin is intended to be exactly as cash: I pay a pizza with bitcoins and I get my pizza. I think that's why Satoshi's paper is titled (A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System), and I didn't see how your scheme would fit there.
However, now I understand that you are referring to the use of bitcoin not as cash but as an asset that you invest into a (maybe mid- or long-term) service. Although (again) from my point of view this has never been the idea of bitcoin, if you really manage to create a protocol for having decentralized and automatic "foundations" as you describe them, I would be amazed (and it would be amazing). I work mostly on the theoretical side and I don't see how you could achieve that, since you are always relying on "trust" at some point. Nevertheless, we never thought that transactions between parties thousands of km away would be possible without a trusted party, and yet here we are. I'd be glad to see your idea working :)
@_date: 2019-01-27 20:12:07
There’s a good paper called something like “on the instability of bitcoin without the block reward”, I think by Arvind Narayanan et. al. It’s a bit negative but the idea is good. Although they show that there might be more orphan blocks (thus potentially making the transaction validation time longer), the security of the network should not be affected.
@_date: 2019-01-28 11:32:12
Yes, that’d be the case if you have two transactions to the same public key and spend one of them, because indeed you have to publish the public key. However, this is not a problem since most wallets will provide you with a different public key every time you receive a new transacion. 
Why do you say hash funcions are harder to break than ECC?
@_date: 2016-09-12 09:38:47
My advice: take a look at bitsquare. It is a decentralized p2p exchange with a very secure scheme for trading. The best security/fee rate for sure.

I see the point, but to me it’s not clear that quantum computers will exist before sha256 is broken (I’m not sure if there are good estimates for this). Historically hash functions have been broken regularly, more than ECC of course, that’s why I asked.

This is probably revealing my identity (isn't that against the rules of reddit?) Well, you can find the thesis [here]( The student struggled with English writing so take the grammar with a pinch of salt. The implementation is good but unfortunately there was not enough time to create a very polished version.
@_date: 2017-10-02 09:33:54
It was a case study on the requirements of a smart contract for decentralized identity management. The main idea is that although governments issue identities, they should not be able to impersonate people nor change/delete identities without people's consent, as it has recently occurred for example in Ukraine. Moreover, all your information is private (unless you want to disclose it), and you can identify yourself to arbitrary third parties without going through the central authority. Of course all of this requires the management of private keys by individuals.
I have to say it was quite a journey. Although there was nothing technically deep (the solutions was implemented on solidity), it took a while for the student to understand the Bitcoin protocol. At the end the main contribution was to understand the precise problems that the protocol provides a solution for in this context.

@_date: 2018-04-09 07:34:47
There is no “official brand” or “official logo” not even an “official website”. This is a decentralized technology with a decentralized community. The genius of the protocol is that value comes from the people that trust the system, it’s not controlled by an entity.
Having said that, I agree that the bitcoin.com website and the  account are confusing for newcommers and we as a community should do domething about it.

Bitcoin is NOT an application of “the blockchain”, a blockchain is a data structure that is used in the bitcoin protocol, The protocol also uses other data structures (and they are even intermingled, for example transactions are stored in Merkle trees whose roots are stored in blocks). Calling the protocol “the blockchain” is rather missleading, but apparently the word just got adopted by a group of snobs: “it’s not about bitcoin, its about THE BLOCKCHAIN” - yeah fuck you. It’s like calling TCP “the lookup tables protocol”.
Don’t get fooled, the genious of Bitcoin is the incentive mechanism behind the protocol, not some data structure. Also, if you study the protocol deeply you can realize that the same properties can be achieved without using a blockchain  (it would just be less efficient). In contrast, if you remove the underlying cryptocurrency then the protocol does not work because you don’t have the right incentives. Moreover we do not know how to make it work under the same conditions of openness and (dis)trust without an underlying cryptocurrency, so a cryptocurrency is intrinsic to the protocol but a blockchain is not. That’s why I prefer to talk about the Bitcoin protocol or the Cryptocurrency protocol; I encourage you to do the same.
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:32:34
Exactly, very well said. The ACT of using the blockchain in Bitcoin is an application of the blockchain, which does NOT make Bitcoin as a whole “an application of the blockchain”. In the same way that the ACT of using a drill for a building is an application of a drill, and that does not make the entire building “an application of the drill”.
