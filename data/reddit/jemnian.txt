One paper I did find that I may use is:

Without actual control of the satellite, I am not sure this is a viable idea.

Interesting, I would imagine using something such as a raspberry pi, but they tend to cost over 20$, and I know there are a few tutorials out there to do this already. You mean just a prepackaged deal? Under 50, probably, less then 20? It would have to be at industrial levels of production in order to factor in economies of scale to get it that low.

Definitely interesting, the only problem I see is that for most countries there is a limited amount of bandwidth you are allowed to use in the public domain so to speak. The issue I see is trying to develop a transmitter and receiver that could download the block chain at any reasonable amount of speed with these limitations.

I'm sorry, I haven't haha. I've been meaning to.

Another thing to add: We are mainly hardware people, not so much software. That is the kind of direction we want to take with this project.

Thanks! :)

So a hardware wallet? I thought hardware wallets were recently developed? Am I wrong on this?

Hahaha, I really do want to make some kind of drone
