Bitcoin doesn't really change how difficult it is for the average person to evade taxes. If you get paid in Bitcoin then your employer needs to also be willing to not report to the government they are employing you and paying you in order for you to evade taxes. Same thing happens if you are paid with fiat, if there is an agreement you can evade taxes but there is a serious risk of getting caught. If you are purely looking at it from evading capital gains taxes then its not different from any other capital gains tax evasion, if you have an agreement to not report it with whoever you do business then you can evade taxes, otherwise everything is reported.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:23:34
You never know, but worst case scenario they can block it. Though that wouldn't make sense, it would make sense for them to charge you for using crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:10:20
We'll technically you can pay for it, its just really expensive. The hope is that in the future better technology will allow for bitcoin to be used as a currency.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:02:13
Tax evasion with Crypto is exactly the same as tax evasion with any other income, there are ways to find out you evaded taxes and there are ways to punish that which is what makes most people pay their taxes.

Ask yourself if you will be ok with losing the money, if you can honestly say yes then invest in bitcoin knowing it may go up massively or it may crash. Otherwise look at other uses for the money.
@_date: 2017-12-13 20:21:46
Yes, they can throttle/limit or require you to purchase a package to allow for mining

Sorry to tell you this but it was withdrawn and you will not be able to get it back.

All of these are valid points, some people believe in Bitcoin, some people believe in different cryptos or some don't believe in cryptos at all. There is no correct answer here, for every negative about your points there is a positive its just about how comfortable you are with that explanation. If you just want to look at this as an investment then this is a completely different discussion but unfortunately it has the same answer where not much is known about the future.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:16:26
If you are just looking at the price then this won't matter in the short run. If you are looking at the feasibility of bitcoin as a currency then this is worrying news.
Investors probably won't care atm but eventually someone will ask what are the uses of bitcoin and why it exists.
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:15:28
In theory profits will come from transaction fees instead and transaction fees will be higher in order to compensate for loss on income from block rewards.
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:22:28
When you verify a transaction you are verifying a block which already has the transaction fee in it.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:49:56
Unfortunately that is how it is atm. You could lower your fees (not sure if bread wallet supports this) but it might take a very long to go through if it even does.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:21:49
The thing is that this already happens, people evade taxes and there are always ways to find out, simple as looking at a store that buys 100 of a good and sells 80 every month. It's a very simple way but it works, most people that evade taxes will never be investigated and tax evasion has always existed in one form or another. Most people/businesses don't evade taxes for the same reason many people don't commit a crime, there is a risk of being caught and the punishment is severe. And lots of tax evasion is recorded in bank transactions, but you still need someone to investigate it to find out so people just aren't caught.

If you do this through a company its different but for an individual you would pay capital tax gain on the profits from bitcoin as if you sold your bitcoin when you are buying the car.
@_date: 2017-12-12 14:43:35
You will have to pay capital tax gain or take on serious risks associated with not paying the tax. You will be killed with fees when you convert to fiat unless you find a dealership which accepts bitcoin.

Serious and simple answer. Link to comment:

Its possible, and you might make money. However, if you are entering now then its not a great time, buying parts is very expensive right now and profits aren't great. I run a few miners and I'm making money but I would never buy this equipment for this purpose, I just have it so might as well use it. You can still make money but you will have to calculate everything precisely as the margin of error for the profit is tiny atm and you will probably need to get cheap electricity.

Two people asked at the same time so i'll copy the response :)
I'll do this in a positives and negatives, feel free to ask anything specific.
* A global payment system which is relatively quick and has relatively low fees
* No direct government/central bank intervention is possible
* Monetary policy has very limited effects and most of it can be scrapped for most countries
* Fairly simple to use and setup and there is loads of potential for business to start with a goal of making bitcoin easier to use
* No inflation
* Has potential to replace gold
* Limited money supply that doesn't increase
* There are better payment systems that still work globally, are faster and have much lower transaction fees, some are even currently implemented such as Ripple and more being developed
* Having no direct government/central bank intervention and monetary policy means that as a currency it cannot be used, no government will ever accept it as a way to pay taxes and if you can't pay taxes in bitcoin then it will never become a major currency of a country/region. There are very important economic reasons that a currency need some sort of control by a government or central bank but this is a long topic, in addition to this governments have no incentives to ever move to bitcoin or any other cryptocurrency.
* A single currency for many countries is a massive problem, this is one of the reasons bitcoin will most likely never become mainstream, the EU is facing this problem every day.
* Bitcoin is not simple to use for most people who are not technical and this will not be solved anytime soon
* Gold has been used for thousands of years, there is a reason gold is gold and bitcoin is not going to replace it anytime soon. There are also many many other ways to store your fiat in a much less volatile investment that still grows faster than inflation or at least as fast with close to no risk. Gold is considered a risky investment in asset management so becoming the new gold isn't enough even for bitcoin.
* This is the big one, no inflation and a limited money supply. For those that own bitcoins right now this is great if bitcoin suddenly became a major currency. For everyone else this is a disaster, not having inflation is a disaster, Japan experienced this recently and there are many other case studies and economic papers you can read about. Inflation and having a flexible money supply is extremely important to an economy but again this is a long topic.
There are more benefits and disadvantages to bitcoin but I can't remember them all right now. Cryptocurrencies are fascinating, the technology has amazing potential and will change the world. However, its very easy to blame fiat for all the problems of economies and they do cause some problems, believing bitcoin will fix them all is foolish. Bitcoin is interesting, its a coin with few real uses today or in the foreseeable future, but its value keeps climbing. It might vanish overnight or it might be here to stay, no one knows. Feel free to ask anything :)
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:41:14
Allot of people don't. The problem is that if a tech company loses 10% of its potential sales then nothing happens. If tomorrow they lost 10% of their current sales then the company is in serious trouble, this is amplified greatly when you are talking about the whole economy. This is a very realistic option that can and has happened, not all people will stop buying stuff because its going to be cheaper by 10% in a year but it only takes a small percent to impact the economy.
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:30:39
Why would the value of fiat burn if they ban cryptocurrencies? 
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:34:14
Pretty much, and some stuff like the dark web won't adopt bitcoin when it can use Monero which is more anonymous, but this is just another problem bitcoin has. I believe Bitcoin will either reform massively and find a goal or it will eventually become a fringe currency used to buy new ICOs as the altcoins of today start to be exchanged for fiat. The technology being developed is still amazing, it has so many implications and is already being used.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:01:54
Sorry but that doesn't make sense, what's the point of a currency if you can't do anything legal with it? If they ban bitcoin then can just ban all cryptocurrencies.
And anyways, no one is having trouble selling illegal goods and services right now and that isn't because of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:14:28
1) that doesn't matter, what counts are the profits, can your or can you not make money? also many machines are run in areas where electricity is cheap.
2) GPUs are not used for bitcoin mining directly anymore as they are not efficient for doing it. ASICs are used instead. What you are talking about is most likely ETH mining or another coin which can still be mined with GPUs. They are sold out if you don't know where to look, plenty are still available for a higher price.
3) That doesn't matter as these are investments, either they are worth it or not. You don't calculate returns by including potential value of second hand machines. You should be running them until they die.
4) That is a legitimate concern, except that right now the increase in the value of coins is outstripping complexity increases.
Right now BTC miners using ASICs exist and are profitable, other miners also exist and are more profitable. The two do not overlap as if you mine bitcoins with ASICs you cannot mine many other coins which are "ASIC proof" and GPU miners cannot mine bitcoin with profits.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:57:34
You have to be paid and be able to pay your taxes in a currency for it to work. Its a problem all currencies have, traditionally governments enforce a currency which solves it but with btc's goal this won't ever happen.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:27:18
They are, this doesn't make my point invalid. Attempting to compare the future price of bitcoin to what you are doing tonight is illogical. It is a real possibility that bitcoin can crash just as it has after many ATH. Does it mean its guaranteed? No, does it mean its a serious possibility? Yes.

Government bans bitcoin, no big firm accepts bitcoin, value plummets. You make money from bitcoin can't explain it to the tax authority of your country, you have bitcoin but can't use it because you can't sell it. Its not impossible, they can destroy bitcoin in a day, it will exist but it will also be worth a fraction of its current value.
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:54:58
Venezuela is a terrible example. You are looking at an unstable economy with an unstable government and a brand new currency. Venezuela was not known for its stability before all this happened.
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:31:08
1) It won't unless it changes drastically, however its not because printing fiat will cause it trouble, the goal is that you buy everything with bitcoins so fiat will eventually have no effect on it, in the future you buy a cup of coffee for x satoshis not like atm where its x USD which is converted to bitcoin.
2) Big companies will adopt bitcoin as some people might buy with bicoin and accepting it is a relatively simple process. However, this is a problem as like you said no average person will buy with bitcoin instead of fiat as just converting fiat to bitcoin can cause you to lose up to 30% of your initial fiat.
3) The value will not stabilise until it becomes a global currency at which point the value will go up indefinitely.  Currently big companies accept bitcoin because the sales they get from it are minor and the publicity is great.
There are loads more to discuss about the future of bitcoin, it has major problems and benefits, I can get into it if you like.
@_date: 2017-08-16 21:33:32
That's plain out not true, its not like bitcoin volatility because gold and silver dwarfs bitcoin but they move every-time investors are anxious.
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:21:50
Bitcoin has a big problem, economically it is not viable as a major currency for allot of reasons (I won't get into that unless you are interested). The two big uses for bitcoin atm and for the foreseeable future is buying altcoins and as a store of  value(this is really controversial). Future for bitcoin is weird, might keep going up or it might disappear, no one knows but its a big gamble.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:22:53
I told you that if you "fight" you create a worthless currency that no one wants to use as most people are law abiding and do not see a reason to inconvenience their lives and risk legal action in order to use cryptocurrencies. I also showed you how your OP is flawed. You could have told me how unlikely it is for them to ban it, how paypal is a company and they shouldn't have this kind of power. Instead you insult me.

I don't understand why Bitcoinization is unstoppable, something gets adopted by the majority for a reason and no one has yet to give me a simple reason as to what bitcoin can offer. There is just no reason for anyone to adopt it beyond it being a nice gimick and being the easiest way to buy altcoins. And the later will eventually stop.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:59:54
That is what I pointed out, currently bitcoin is going through deflation because the value of bitcoin is skyrocketing and when you buy things with bitcoin the price in bitcoin is usually found from the price of the product in USD and then converted. If the value of bitcoin were to level off now then there would be a form of inflation but this is a short term solution that isn't going to happen as in the short term bitcoin's price will most likely only increase.
@_date: 2017-08-06 19:37:11
So a deflationary crisis happens because people are incentivised to store value, however you are saying its a bad thing(this part we both agree on) and you said bitcoin allows people to store value. So do you see the problem?
@_date: 2017-08-16 23:55:29
Bitcoin won't but that doesn't mean the government won't take it from you if you perform illegal activities using it or much worse they can simply just ban it.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:40:02
Torrents =/= currency, a currency needs to be stable for people to use it, if you are making $1000 a month you need to know that is still gonna be around $1000 next month (this is one of thousands of examples). Torrents don't need to be this stable and therefore cannot be compared. You're also really enforcing your superior intellect by insulting me /s
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:35:58
A crash to the 1k (around a 75% crash) territory will seriously set bitcoin back, I would not call that a small crash. Anyways you also don't know that, there is no reason for bitcoin to not go to sub-$1000 just like there is no reason for bitcoin to not be under $10k in a few months. Bitcoin right now is like betting on a stock, anything can happen.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:04:34
The problem is that if bitcoin doesn't aim to replace fiat then what is the point of it? why would a seller even accept it? They won't give a better price, just as today when you buy with bitcoins you get a worse price in real terms than if you bought it with fiat.
From the consumer's perspective you can't wait when buying food but if you are buying a luxury then people will wait if they know the price will fall. The bigger problem is that if this causes just 5% of purchases to be delayed then the economy is going into recession.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:20:41
No one knows with value as its so far into the future. Right now the plan is that miners will charge transaction fees when the block rewards disappear but this can change although unlikely.

That is one of the reasons deflation can be a very scary prospect in economics. You can also look at effects on deflation in the same article.
That's another website that gives a simple overview about deflation, its important to note that not all types deflation is bad but the type bitcoin is experiencing is the problematic type.

The government bans cryptos, no businesses pay or accepts cryptos, no law abiding citizen (which most are) uses crypto. This can happen, illegal activities using bitcoin only make this a possibility.
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:42:51
But if its banned then the value of bitcoin will plummet and it will never grow to be big. If business and law abiding citizens (which most are) don't accept it then it will never be used and it will continue to be like today where using bitcoin for most people in an inconvenience.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:06:15
That still doesn't make sense, you make a new crypto, its illegal as its a crypto, they don't need to shut it down. Simply no one who is law abiding will accept it which is most of the people and businesses in most countries. Therefore you make something which is worthless, so again why is this any different?
@_date: 2017-08-05 22:54:12
What do you mean by people need liquid store of value? this is a tiny part of the population that has enough wealth to need a liquid store of value which isn't simply fiat or a mutual fund. I still don't understand why bitcoin will ever be adopted and if magically it did get adopted then I do not understand how its sustainable as a major currency or even as a liquid store of value as its an extremely volatile asset which makes it one of the worst liquid store of value.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:09:39
This is my biggest fear for bitcoin, if this is a real problem then why would bitcoin exist in the long term? There are quicker and cheaper ways of transferring fiat and as long term storage it will eventually stop working as it has no real use in the long term. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:08:29
Also the biggest reason a government can decide to ban cryptocurrencies and kill them overnight. So no I will not be supporting them.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:13:02

@_date: 2017-08-17 09:14:32
Bitcoin doesn't need to be wiped out, it just needs to have a less promising future. Bitcoin's current price is mainly caused by speculative investing, if investors think its not gonna go up then its gonna lose most of its value. 
Gold on the other hand is a safe haven, investors use gold when they are anxious about the financial market. Gold also has a value as a commodity as its a very useful element. Stocks which are highly valued usually represent a solid company with low chances of disappearing. However this can and has happened in the past, so similarly to bitcoin it might go up, down or just disappear.
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:12:22
They exist, they are profitable. Thoughts are broken to two main parts, they are great because they give the bitcoin network the power to process transactions. However, this is concentrating allot of bitcoin wealth in the hands of very few people/organisations.
@_date: 2017-08-17 01:49:37
Just like a stock, it can bounce back every time. Until it doesn't, that's why people sell, or at least one of the reasons. There are countless assets/currencies/securities much older and more reliable than bitcoin that sank and never got back, they might in the future but right now they aren't.
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:27:34
The idea of the OP was that bitcoin is untouchable, can't be banned. I think you agreed that it can be banned.
Not sure why you think countries that have been stable for hundreds of years suddenly will become unstable for no reason? crypto's have a great tech and can offer great services but these will be used because the technology is great, not because of instability.
@_date: 2017-08-16 22:16:19
This is a tricky question. There isn't much to buy with bitcoin but there is a bit. Mainly you can buy stuff online or from independent places in big cities. Go into most stores, especially in smaller towns, and ask to pay with bitcoin and they will just get confused. The next problem is that even if you find someone that accepts bitcoin its a terrible idea to buy with bitcoin instead of fiat. The price is found by converting it from BTC to USD, you are already paying more with bitcoin than with fiat as the price selected is usually a high one. Another problem is that in most cases getting bitcoin means you need to buy bitcoin and fees will increase the price again. All in you can be paying 30% more because you want to use bitcoin instead of fiat. The result is that no one wants to buy with bitcoin.
This is also a problem for sellers, if you sell goods and services for bitcoins there is a good chance your suppliers don't accept bitcoins so converting means more fees. The result is that sellers don't want to accept bitcoin unless they see the cost as using the bitcoin wave to gain fairly cheap advertising.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:51:01
The problem is that is only a short term solution, controlled inflation in bitcoin will be under 1% by 2025 and will continue to drop until it is insignificant.

You don't know that, no one does. BTC can fall to 500 tomorrow or rise to 5000. One is less likely than the other but both are still a valid possibility.

Best sources I found was to search bitcoin on The Economist website, though I think you are limited to 2 articles per day or something like that without a subscription. Most of their articles on the subject or are pretty good but a bit basic, beyond that I mainly googled stuff like bitcoin problems and similar searches and just read everything from google scholar, news and the main search results. It took me a while to research this and I do not consider myself very knowledgeable in the subject so be patient and prepare allot of time. Coindesk is another good source but it is mainly pro cryptos so some of the articles need to be taken with a grain of salt. I think there isn't really a trustworthy source that covers bitcoin, sometimes they have a good article and sometimes they don't its mainly up to you whether you agree with it or not. BTW this isn't accurate science, the people saying to the moon might be right you never know. The big thing is to remember that if its too good to be true then it probably is. 
From my memory the alliance the big companies are planning is more about block-chain technology and how they are going to standardise it, I doubt they would ever use third party technology unless it is brilliant and patented as it would just be too much money handed out to a small company who offers little to no benefits.
Technically banks could move to bitcoin tomorrow morning, however, they cannot operate as they do right now as you cannot loan bitcoins you do not have physical access too. Its possible but it would take the banking system back hundreds if not thousands of years. I doubt this would ever happen on a large scale as they just cannot make a decent amount of money through this if at all.
TBH the reason people invest in Bitcoin imo is because it is a good gamble, it might disappear tomorrow or it might keep growing but throwing in $100 for most people is not a problem and they learn allot, some might even make money. I don't want to say bitcoin will be gone/tiny in a few years but it is a very real possibility. I believe its biggest problem is that as a currency no one is actually spending bitcoin, this goes much deeper but I find that sums it up nicely.
Also using bitcoin to learn stocks is a great resource! it is fairly similar to the stock market although a bit crazier.

Anything can happen, from the government banning bitcoin to investors just losing interest as they aren't seeing the massive returns they thought would happen. If one of these happen the value of bitcoin crashes and hard, it will also most likely never go back up.

I don't think you appreciate how small and young bitcoin is, if it gets banned then most people will not care, its minuscule compared to other currencies or assets. This is the point where its most vulnerable. 
Unlike the gold rush which affected many people as they saw a way to make money, whether it was mining for gold or catering to the needs of the gold miners. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:55:28
It can't be a store of value if its illegal, not to mention that there are better ways than bitcoin to store value. And it doesn't take all the countries in the world, just need a few of the bigger economies and it will just get crushed.

Ripple is designed to deal with this problem. Also the cost of a few cents and sending in 10 min is very unrealistic, if your a big corporation/bank with many transactions then you use ripple as they are atm. If you are an individual then you can realistically lose 
 around 30% of your fiat after converting to btc then transfering to someone else and then converting back to fiat, it will also take more than 10 minutes and allot of work.
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:06:10
Depends how you look at it. The easier answer is that it has a higher chance that it will go up and not down, however, if something goes wrong then it can go to 0. The chances of something wrong happening, well your guess is as good as any.

That does happen in some places, at which point money becomes worthless as well. But why are you linking the argument about how deflation is fine linked to the possibility of society collapsing? that isn't a great way to argue for deflation.
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:05:38
Reality is very complicated, the great recession is also very complicated and there are still arguments about why it happened and why it was so severe. The problem is that the deflation that is depicted in the meme has happened to countries such as Japan and the results were terrible for the economy. Deflation itself is not good for the average person but these memes make it seem like its great which is why I have a problem with them.

The deflationary spiral is an economic theory that has been proven correct on multiple occasions. 


Can you explain that sentence? it doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:17:18
Just saw you weren't OP, sorry about that. The other points are still valid.
If you only look at block rewards then it's rate of inflation is falling and will be insignificant as time goes on. However Bitcoin is massively deflationary if you look at the price of Bitcoin.

Deflation and inflation are not that simple, this picture fails to mention that real incomes(these are adjusted to inflation) have increased so people can buy more, not less, while you are showing the opposite. For deflation the two big problems is that this picture doesn't show any of the problems of deflation such as the possibility of a deflationary crisis, increased costs of loans to name a few. Also one of the most important ones is that you cannot widely buy groceries with BTC as the picture suggests unlike with USD.

A government with debt that becomes unsustainable is bad for everyone, however, this is only part of the reason that deflation is a problem. Another very serious problem with deflation is the deflationary spiral, this is a result of people spending less and saving more. The economy experiences less demand which leads to lower demand, this results in lower production and people losing jobs. Then those people can't afford to consume and demand continues to fall, this cycle continues as the economy enters into a serious recession. This isn't theory, this happened multiple times in the past.
I don't understand your suggestion that reducing division of labour would be rational, in an extreme case as you suggest this would result in the world going back hundreds of years to a point where everyone was farmers in-order to be self-sufficient. I don't understand why this is rational or a good thing. 
I'm not sure how your idea of high interest rates would work, people will always invest their money where it will give them the best returns, whether this is saving or lending money. The problem is that entrepreneurs will not loan money as there would be no demand for whatever they produce, it will also be extremely expensive which will mean they will not be making any profits. 
What is the link between how wasteful people are and productivity? spending less does not equate to higher productivity, these two are not linked.
I understand your point about how Inflation is politically convenient as it does make loans cheaper, however, that is just part of a very complicated story about deflation and inflation.

That is an impossible task, you are asking for an example of a country that saw the problem of deflation and let it happen as it destroyed the economy. I am also not aware of any countries that ever had a truly limited money supply in the last 200 years.
I can show you countless pieces of literature about the problems of deflation with examples but none will fulfil your point as it contradicts itself.
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:36:15
The problem is that deflation is a terrifying prospect for an economy, many have experienced it, none have manged to exist successfully with it and there is a reason for governments and central banks to fear it.

This is the same as bitpay, you are not using bitcoin to pay for your groceries, you are converting bitcoin to fiat and then loading a prepaid card with it. This is the same as you selling your bitcoins for fiat, depositing it in your bank account and using your debit card. At the end of the day you are not actually using bitcoin, you will also lose a significant amount of your money to conversion fees.
Increased costs of loans is not a good thing, people still need a place to live, prices will just go up, this benefits no one. This happened when interest rates were much higher, people just paid more for their mortgages. Also businesses need loans to expand and some of them to exist, they cannot afford to spend more on servicing debt. More expensive debt due to deflation can only hurt everyone except for the creditors.

This is more about income inequality but this also shows the general trend. Real incomes are on the rise, might not be as distributed as most would prefer but they are going up.
@_date: 2017-09-07 15:55:43
The arguments against deflation aren't theoretical, deflation has occurred multiple times and I have yet to find a time where the results were anything but troubling to say the least. Also the idea that inflation is "evil" is very debatable. You can argue allot about the correct level of inflation.
Real incomes haven't been stagnant for decades, they have kept rising, not as much as after WW2 but they have kept rising. If you only look at very certain times (during recessions) then they have stagnated but that isn't exactly a fair review of income growth. What you are probably experiencing/describing is the problem of income inequality, but this has nothing to do with the subject.

I think you should read the article again, even if you agree with the headline that wages have barely budged then the article suggests there is a reason for this and it has nothing to do with inflation. The article also states that there was 4% wage growth before the great recession and fails to specify whether this accounts for inflation and over what time-period. It also uses a questionable time-period by comparing data from 2014 which is still in what many would consider the recovery period after the great-recession. The article also suggests that even though wages haven't increased in recent years as much as they have in the past there has been a significant increase in other forms of compensation. 
Also the article states that wages have increased but most of this increase has benefited the upper income brackets.
It's important to not that this is an opinion piece by a journalist and not a study. This is why it is short and severely lacks in the depth needed to discuss this topic.

Could you clarify your question? 
In nominal terms it takes less time to earn a bitcoin today but I am not sure what the point of that is?
@_date: 2017-09-08 12:57:00


You are arguing that deflation isn't bad. These terms are all defined, these are all standard economic terms with only one definition. Why does this have anything to do with whether the government should rule us or not?
@_date: 2017-09-08 13:36:55
Deflation itself never shows up alone, there are always other reasons in an economy for deflation to occur. If you look for an economy that experienced a recession and it was purely due to deflation you will never find it. However enforcing deflation on an economy is where the problem is, no one will allow it to happen. Bitcoin is far from having a large enough market cap and is far from being used as a currency to be an example for a country's economy.
@_date: 2017-09-07 17:12:32
Why is it natural in a growing economy? 
Economies that experienced deflation have seen a shrinking economy and therefore a reduction in real income. I'm unsure why you think its natural.
Inflation results in lower debt so I am unsure how deflation would help with that.

You can still go to a supermarket and buy food with fiat, that isn't true of bitcoin atm for most places. Also you don't hold cash, you invest it. If you want to compare something you hold then compare stocks, gold etc. to bitcoin, not cash.
Also not sure what you mean by deflation isn't bad for hard currency? its bad for an economy so not sure what you are referring too.

This makes no sense, they mainly don't replace the current system because it works, it would be expensive to change and there would be a disruption while doing so. Also if they wanted to replace the system then why would they use bitcoin? there are better alternatives, not to mention that they can build a brand new custom system. 
Another point is that this doesn't happen everywhere, your bank may be using an older systems but others are using modern systems.

You aren't actually paying with bitcoins, you are loading fiat onto a visa card after converting bitcoins into fiat. The merchant doesn't care because you are just like every other customer which uses fiat, you are not paying the merchant with bitcoin. You can also convert bitcoin into fiat have it deposited into your account and pay with a debit card, its the same thing. You will also lose a significant amount of money to conversion costs which makes this completely redundant for most people as they will not pay a significant amount more when they can just use fiat.

I bought some from localbitoins from one of the big companies that sell there. First verification was a bit difficult because I had to take a selfie with my ID and a picture of my debit card with most the numbers hidden. Although now I don't need to verify again and can buy as many as I want from them. The rate was also the best I could find compared to everywhere else I could buy a bitcoin i.e ATM.

Will look into it, thanks.

Thanks man that really help a noob like me :)

Thank you very much for your help, reading them both now.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:15:05
Thanks for your help, I think ill get some off localbitcoins because I just want a small amount to see what the experience is when using bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-21 14:53:17
Thanks for clearing up bittrex, really just wanted to try bitcoins and buying them seems simple/complicated depending on the website I ended up in.
