I believe in what Bitcoin stands for, and is a gift for all of us. I do think that innovation, progress and learning is also important. As the old Chinese proverb goes: "Those that do not want to walk should not stop those that do".

Vigilance would need to be exercised not only against a potential  scam but if the question is on building the economy then the process would have to account for things like shipping, delivery condition and return of goods among adversarial actors (i.e. broken merchandise to swindle the other party under arbitration rules, a la eBay, etc ). Would  web of trust less insurance contract work ....

it seems to me that playing the larger cycles once a year or two is very doable, just don't be greedy.

North Korea consistently targets crypto wallets and infrastructure [edit: hacking attempts]. I don't think they sell BTC to USD and lose stealth.

Just looking at the historical ebb and flow hugging the 21week SMA, 3.5 to 4 year full cycle of bull/bear, with about 80-85 drawdowns, with reference to Mayers 200day multiple and stock to flow ratio charts, I think it is plausible to assume we are on the uptrend now, correcting back into a bear in a couple of years. Having a low time preference one can disregard much of the accumulation and distribution phases and just come in at the middle 60% of the rise and fall of the price, selling at the top they feel comfortable with, waiting a year-ish and buying it back when the inevitable  lows are in. the inevitable lows are there because this asset moves in cycles, historically, and I don't expect it to stabilize enough to flatten out for another 2 cycles.

Yeah, it is hard to call tops and bottoms. Mid 60-70% gives you are good indication of a trend reversal so you can make decisions to hold through a correction upward or a dump. you can always dca up and down in percentage bought or sold. my point was that the larger trend sell/buy might help in accumulating more BTC along the way without too much headache. Taxes on gains when you sell (edit) may subtract from that somewhat  though.

The time preference determines whether you consider something a store of value or not. On a yearly chart, bitcoin is positive. you have to know your time horizon (days to week to months ) vs. years and decades.

Andreas is not a BTC maximalist. He accepts ETH as well.

Hello, 
Great job with the app! If possible please improve the tax reporting section. A few concerns: the transaction report is available sooner in the year, and if possible, would like to have a more digestible format of trades and cost basis. 
Thank you.

instigate, facilitate or assist in internal dev wars, bleed and drain attention and trust for the coin so people move their SoV elsewhere. sprinkle some porn embedded into the chain, compounded by outlawing operating full nodes, it might just dissipate... plus, backdoor miner chips, and/or social anti-btc campaign when the backdoors are revealed. embrace, extend, extinguish ...

Also, may be a single source of putting a chunk of change into crypto. Many have accumulated money in a 401k that they are willing to roll over without a withdrawal penalty. Yes, you have counterparty risk but not more than you have an opportunity risk at this point.

 What makes you think they are abandoned? And node wallets without a passphrase? Welcome to the honeypot. The best you can do is press Ctrl+D on your terminal and pray that your IP is not the one correlated to the transfer, or that the coins are not so tainted you do not want to touch them anyway.

Suffering in some form is always a part of making a sacrifice. Bitcoin going up to "500 grand" is a side effect of its growing, not the main expectation. It is an experiment. You may have unrealistic expectations. If you entered with the expectation of making a lot of money on your presumed investment in  a short term, via holding, you will need to expect the swings. How well you cope with them starts with the realization that your investment can be fully and irreversibly gone tomorrow. Can you accept this premise? Hope is not a substitute for reality. As long as your expectations are in line, and you continue to be in the market, you can begin to appreciate the sacrifice your have consciously made, and the lowered time preference on an emerging speculative asset class. Sell now if you want no doubt or want to avoid suffering whatsoever. Hold if you believe. Unlike hope, belief fully assumes the presence of suffering. Your health state in this context is directly correlated  with being clear about your own intentions, your belief and the decisions you make. Take responsibility for these, and you will make the right choice.

invest. long term. also not wanting to pay taxes for purchases or trades either, waiting for regulation to be sensible about no charging tax up until a certain sum of transaction.

he left way after 'things got rough'. I think there was simply nothing interesting for him to discuss in the space at the time. speaking of: people on youtube can do what they please, and noone entitled to anything, come and go as you please. as long as there was no scam, no money owed, I am cool. looking forward to a fresh perspective.

devils advocate: is the very possibility of miners to vote and agree or disagree on the reorg  not the essence of a free market forces?

I would also add taxes. You would have to track all the purchases for reporting purposes. In the situation when you spend the same BTC that arrived in your wallet and held it under a year, you would incur short term capital gains tax. that's if your circumstances allow you to hold BTC and not spend it within a short period of time when the price fluctuation is not significant.  So you figure a premium on fiat/BTC, BTC/fiat, plus tax on BTC, and tracking... I honestly am waiting to use BTC more but those thoughts are holding me back. my .02
