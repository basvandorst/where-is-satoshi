I would **actually** use this.  I tried to use my Chase credit card online the other day for a ~$250 purchase and it didnt go through for whatever reason (didnt even specify a reason just said cannot be processed).  Gave me no options to try and get the transaction through.  Other times I have to call some 1800 number, wait 10 minutes, speak to a robot, then a representative, then jump through loopholes to provide my identity - all just to make a purchase online.  Im tired of it.  Ill gladly just pay in Bitcoin for larger expense items.  And PayPal is worse.  I hate no company quite like I hate PayPal.
Online companies especially international have no idea how much business they are losing because their payment processors drive away customers from them.

*now* they do. But in the early days it was difficult and none of that was available.  There were no forms generated and people didnt know how to report and keep track of trades especially when the exchanges themselves would log your trades incorrectly and a single sweep of the book would generate thousands of micro trades.  Also some exchanges shut down or froze users out of their accounts, etc.  And the IRS gave terrible guidelines at first on what the assets were classified as or how to account.  
The IRS should cut slack on new tech where they have and still have abysmal and confusing rules and regulations.  Maybe go after people who literally paid absolutely nothing and leave the rest who tried their best to pay (as I did in each and every year).
They could crack down on literally one large corporation or billionaire and get 10x more than they will get out of this fishing expedition.

It sounds like the new exchange will own the remaining BTC and the exchange will be owned by the 24k Mt Gox victims proportionately if I understand this correctly.  I don't see the downside here.  If the alternative happened and the BTC was distributed at prior fair value at time of loss that would mean he and Mark (and other owners) would get all the victims BTC at present value.  Hes doing this so that does not happen and they get their fair value proceeds, not the shitty hand the court will hand them.  His plan sounds responsible and a better deal for the victims if I'm understanding this correctly.  Brock is already a billionaire, I really don't think he cares this much about making more money to sacrifice his reputation and world standing at this point.
And by the way, your claim is completely false considering he only owns ~12% of the exchange (and if he doesnt then he has no claim at all) which makes me think you don't know him and made this whole thing up.  There is literally no circumstance where he would pocket all the victims BTC.  Don't know what your motive is here.

Peter is generally correct about monetary policy, I agree with him on a macro sense. But hes just wrong on investing, timing, technology, and other areas.

Basically I'm putting up this chart to show that Peter Schiff is full of shit (although I think hes correct on monetary policy). Gold declined ~45% from Dec 2011 until the trough in 2015 (he likes to ignore this). Bitcoin is basically a more volatile store of value than gold with a shorter time frame and higher booms and busts than Gold. Which makes sense because the MC is lower and its more in price discovery mode. However, they both go up over time.

This next recession looks much worse for fiat than in 2001 (as echoed by some of the greats like Ray Dalio). We are now at global negative interest rates and already there is talk of QE4. Fiat exit ramps are likely to be used and Bitcoin might be considered one at this point. Ill mention that the 2008 recession saw a quick dip in the price of gold (followed by a huge bull run) but that recession is considered an outlier and much harsher than a normal one (in terms of equities and housing price declines). We shall see. Obviously other factors at play here but just thought this was interesting and worth sharing.

SHA256 is quantum proof so your cold wallet will always be safe even without an upgrade.  Also this shit is not even close to having the capability to break hot wallets (elyptic curve).  10 years minimum is what every leading expert says including the head of the Google quantum project, but easily 20 or 30 years.  Its a fud campaign and has actually been used in the past if you have monitored this space since ~2016.  Many of the articles they spread were from 2018 like that shitty Medium one that went around by the anon author which contained a lot of half truths.
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:16:18
**1)** Quantum computers cant crack SHA256 (so **cold wallets will always be safe**)
**2)** Every leading expert says that quantum computers are a minimum of 10 years away but probably 20 or 30.  And we dont even know if a quantum computer could be tasked with cracking anything.  If you have even a single task such as an "if then statement" to highlight a match you are bottlenecked at regular computer speeds.  And there are about 4 breakthroughs that need to happen for it to ever be useful.
**3)** Bitcoin obviously can update the elyptic curve encryption if needed in the future which protects hot wallets.  They should do this sooner rather than later just from a psychological stance.
There is no short or medium term threat from quantum computers.  This debate comes up every time Bitcoin goes sideways and shorters need to start up a fud campaign.  You're getting played.
@_date: 2019-09-25 18:56:52

SHA256 doesnt need to change (it takes over 10^77 required guesses for brute forcing 256 bits), its ECDSA in the distant future that will need it.  Yes it can be upgraded.
fyi it takes over 10^77 required guesses for brute force 256 bits, which is a number larger than the total number of atoms in the universe.

Completely depends on future volume and lending competition as well as the btc price.  So at the very least 3 variables.  Still beats negative rates/paying banks 1% per year to hold your cash like in many nordic countries such as Switzerland and Germany.

@_date: 2019-05-22 01:29:46
It is when you are a seller and you need to make a margin on production.  This is a completely different scenario.  Its a secondary trading market.  
This isnt a bitcoin production business.  Producing bitcoins is just mining incentive which is adjustable based on the hashing difficulty/competition.
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:08:49
Not seeing the contradiction.  An MIT license takes 10 seconds to copy into a codebase.  All it does is prevent people like Craig from trying to claim ownership of the tech and preventing others from using it.

@_date: 2019-05-22 02:17:19
I used to work at JP Morgan, and now I work somewhere else.  Im not impressed by the halo effect and their methodology is incorrect.  The BTC price is supply and demand.  This isnt a bitcoin production factory where we consider a margin of production via cost to produce vs BTC price especially when the hashing difficulty is dynamic.  
If more people want to buy than there are sellers willing to sell, the price goes up.  And vice versa.  Its a simple as that.  Don’t let anyone try to convince you otherwise and obfuscate the situation.
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:14:36
No idea.  It will depend on future volume and lending participants.  Rate of return will be constantly changing.  Hopefully the rate is low which means the market is efficient and liquid and has lots of competition.
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:41:46
Preparing to be disappointed.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:27:22
The hashing difficulty changes based on the btc price.  It makes absolutely no sense.  And what does supply and demand care about this anyway.
What do buyers care about how much it costs to produce a bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-21 19:37:53
Oh right. Yeah, that.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:25:23
Right.  As I said, it doesnt matter the ratio of price to produce vs the market price.  All that happens when the btc price rises is more competition enters and the hashing difficulty goes up.  Then the price to produce increases.  The btc price leads the price to produce.  It always has.  
Regardless, the price is a product of supply and demand.  The analysts assigned to this assessment at JP Morgan are fools.  Or they know they are wrong but are trying to make a bear case for their clients to keep them away.  The BTC price is not dependent on miners/cost and rewards to produce.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:01:49

@_date: 2019-05-22 01:37:13
They are higher right now.  But actually that doesnt matter even if they are lower.  The way the bitcoin protocol works is the cost to product goes down when miners drop out.  So there is always an equilibrium.  The price to produce is higher than the market price when miners refuse to drop out because they think the btc price will go back up.
@_date: 2019-05-22 01:38:48
Yeah low fees per transaction.  But if volume ramps up it could make a return.  I dont expect it to justify the market cap as a store of value but its better than a negative interest rate where you pay banks to hold your money.
