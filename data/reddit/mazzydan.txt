I'm not familiar with gopax.com but if they have both USDT and BTC deposit addresses they should be able to do a recovery.  Not all exchanges do cross chain recoveries given how protected private keys are and the liability associated.  Bittrex wouldn't even consider mine unless it was more than $5k and I had to pay .1 btc for it.

Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin at the moment, it was one of the few sites that could hold all of them.

Only one Buttcoin leave it to me to even mess up buying the right brand of coin

I think that sub is funny is some weird way.  God knows we need a little humor around here...

I'm having he exact same problem. Am locked out of my 2fa after the authenticator app deleted my code.  Need their help to reset and can't contact anyone to save my life.

Thanks so much someone finally got in touch with my via support and took care of the issue.  Regardless of the delay I appreciate the help.

I have Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin in there.  Its a good service and until now I've never had an issue.  The problem here was actually google auth and 2fa.  Getting it reset in a secure way is a problem but wish they had it integrated with my phone number like a lot of other sites do so I'm not dependent on an app.

is there a litecoin core?
@_date: 2014-12-24 19:14:33
just downloaded it.
@_date: 2014-12-24 19:16:50
good tip, thank you!
@_date: 2014-12-24 19:15:22
do any of these support multiple wallets from different cryptos?
@_date: 2014-12-24 19:14:22
appreciate the link, I will check it out.

I saw this but after reading a lot of crap about Coinbase, I'm less likely to want to keep my wallet there.  
Still unsure about Celery as I haven't seen any negative posts yet, but I'd like to have full control of my coins and also be secure, in the most unobtrusive way possible.
@_date: 2014-12-24 23:35:50
Definitely

Thanks for your suggestion. Before this I would have said it was unnecessary but I’ve learned my lesson.  I needed to take this far more serious and be more cautious.

Money was recovered as of today so a real champion effort by Bittrex to recover my funds in ~15 days.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:19:59
Yep I read their recovery policy it says .1 btc but given the amount I sent it would be worth it.  
They have been helpful before but it was a tiny amount of a waves token not a huge amount of USDT sent to a BTC address...

Wanted to post an update. Bittrex contacted me today and took payment of .1 BTC to recover my coins cross chain.  They said it can take upwards of a month which isn’t ideal but it’s way better than losing them altogether. 
Major props to the support team for getting back to me so quickly. I was pretty much unsure what might happen and this has given me a lot of respect for their responsiveness.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:20:48
Yep my Polo support contact said it was doable because of that reason but unfortunately despite my enhanced verification I don't have a similar direct contact at Bittrex (or an invite to their slack).  If someone does have one or can get me an invite I'd appreciate it.

you can't unring the bell anymore than you can stop people from wanting t make money

if anyone else compared bitcoin to something from the 1600's they'd get laughed out of the room.  This is pre-USA let alone pre-globally connected markets why is this even relevant?
