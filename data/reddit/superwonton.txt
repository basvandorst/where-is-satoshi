"always correct"��

I own Bitcoin and there isn't a rebound coming. 
I hope I am wrong

How sad is your life that you're looking for attention from anyone willing to reply to you?
@_date: 2018-03-09 06:28:37
Dumb and dumber up in here.
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:58:11
Oh shut up. There's a million people like you on here. Do the world a favor and stop posting. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:18:45
You are a sad individual

Funny how all the haters come out of the woodwork on any down day. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 04:51:44
Nate, you're a pitiful human being with no life. Shut up and find something to do with your time 
@_date: 2018-02-24 16:13:36
Nate you are one pessimistic guy. Hope you get the help you need.

No, just tired of reading you idiots post.

Do you think more or less institutions/people will buy crypto after the hearing?
If you think yes, there is no reason to not believe it will rise to higher valuation. 
I remember there is someone who bought $1 million futures that Bitcoin will be trading above $50k in December. Take that for what it's worth than your opinion you formulated while you took public transportation getting to work from your parents basement.

Another "expert"!

I realized there is a huge group of people who will always remain on the sidelines and will naysay just about anything because they don't agree or understand it. 
These are the same guys who said housing is bubble in 2011 so they never bought in. They said Amazon stock was overpriced at $200 or Apple is not a good buy after the split. Today these guys are saying Bitcoin is a scam. 
Good luck guys and keep fighting your fight to be right.

There are a lot of losers with no money who want everyone to be in their same boat.

CNBC also says stock market will rally or crash everyday.

I'm from metro Detroit, lived there until I was in my 20s and I can tell you it's not. Go explore the world and grow yourself.

Detroit has been shit for a long time.
