Can't something be done about this?  It sounds corrupt.  Why did it go down after I bought?  I'm really nervous now :(
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:13:48
my heart is pounding a million miles an hour :/
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:25:49
I wonder if I should sell now, fuck.
@_date: 2018-01-01 17:47:41
2) How can this be true if it's 100% open source?
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:54:19
yeah i'd lose sleep and shit watching my investment go south.  idk how this can ever be avoided honestly.   i could try dollar cost averaging... except, FOMO.
good point about FML stress.

half past your mothers ass
@_date: 2018-01-02 18:51:54
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:48:19
just worried it'll be higher than it is now if i do that.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:56:45
Whoa. :D
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:57:25
in fact it looks to be selling off now?
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:57:42
word my man, just trying to "time the market" as they say.  you know, do exactly what i'm not supposed to do :D
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:27:26
Panicking its at 14750
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:33:23
Yum_Kaax you have some answering to do, pal:
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:56:06
mmmm beer, tanks :D
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:19:19
I bought and I'm panicking, fuuu
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:34:23
What am I, a clown for your amusement? 
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:49:29
it will go lower? i'm worried that it'll drop as soon as i buy, knowing my luck. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:53:28
That felt like today, though, right?  when it busted 14000 it was a rocket ship,  now 15000... next?
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:27:44
14737.25  this sucks, my heart is racing
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:57:01
word, just not at ATH or anywhere near it :) trying to "buy the dip"
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:55:51
well i didnt buy yet and its down a bit now :D
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:08:31
Technical Analysis isn't about predicting from what i understand, im trying to figure out if i should invest now
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:14:08
thanks Yum_Kaax, that helps.  Just bought now.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:36:24
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:19:32
good idea but shit too late
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:29:30
Funny how?  How the FUCK am I funny to you?
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:02:06
oooo im nervous, want to buy now at 14900
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:44:38
Dude I was just kidding.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:59:34
You, with your sound logic and responsible advice :D
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:59:50
Right but where does it go from here?
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:12:43
ok buying!
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:00:00
When do I buy?
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:03:51
I'm just trying to understand societal mechanisms.  Wouldn't it be better if we helped each other instead of, oh nevermind, I want to BUY NOW.  I can't take it anymore.
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:45:05
Fuck my life, I want out now.  Just lost like 2% of my savings.
@_date: 2018-01-02 20:50:47
if i buy now, its like right around 15000 and if it keeps going up i'll be happy. if it goes down i'll be sad.  it'll be stressful either way.  FOMO if it goes up without me.  FML if it goes down with me.
If I don't buy and it goes down, that's probably the happiest scenario.  Buy now and goes up = also happy.

Couldn't a channel stay open indefinitely, effectively subverting the transparency of the public ledger?
Aren't the transactions within the channel now private?  Are they on a public shared ledger of some kind, or any type of public ledger?
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:56:38
Newbie here.  Trying to understand how LN works.
* So, I want to send 0.00003 BTC using lighting network to 50 random people.  Who opens the 50 LN channels?  Or do I open one channel with someone else?  Whose bitcoin besides mine is held in the multi-sig wallet?
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:35:24
First off, opening a channel involves a real on-chain transaction, so that takes time already, right?
Secondly, those 50 people would need a channel already (with enough BTC already allocated? is that right?) to even be able to facilitate a multi-hop payment?  Doesn't that mean you first need BTC, then secondly you need to allocate X amount of BTC to your LN channel in order to even be able to receive &lt;= X BTC? Am I understanding it right?
Thirdly, so it seems you need to open a channel to be able to use lighting network, and that channel has to be opened with a specific amount of BTC that is tied up.
Fourthly, I'm really curious about the security implications of off-chain transactions.  I've read the whitepaper and design discussions but curious whether there's been independent auditing?  BTC is well-vetted by now, but not LN.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:37:15
General thought:  Bitcoin by design relies on trustless consensus for all transactions, to ensure atomic transactions, etc., not entirely unlikely a relational DB.  Lightning Network feels like bolting on a caching layer like memcached, which introduces a lot of complexity to the design of an application.  Developers avoid this if possible, because it is error-prone and expands complexity of an application greatly.  
IDK yet about LN.  Same concerns per previous comments, but I need to learn more to have a qualified voice here.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:49:31
So, all 50 people need to open a channel, which requires an on-chain transaction?  So, minimum 50 on-chain transactions in this case?
I'm concerned about the security design itself of LN, not that there is a specific concern that I have, but generally just concerned because such a mechanism really needs time to prove itself as secure and robust, regardless of what protocols are implemented.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:01:17
How long do these channels last?  Aren't they meant to be opened and closed within days?  Wouldn't that limit the number of transactions someone could do and/or "force" them to make transactions?  Why would anyone want to pay X exorbitant on-chain transaction fees just for the privilege of actually using their digital currency for day-to-day spending?
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:18:21
In this case we're dealing with money, and the longer a channel is open, the more money is going to deviate from the single source of truth.  Good nodes can go bad.  IDK yet, just thinking out loud.  Nobody should take my statement to mean or imply anything, since I'm still learning about it, so my statements could be misguided.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:14:41
Basic newbie question alert (still trying to wrap my mind around the basics while testing the deep-end simultaneously, so please bear with me):  So if I am a business and I open a channel and want to be able to receive X BTC, do I need to fund my channel with minimum X BTC as "collateral"?
Also, it seems like one would not want to keep their channel open too long since there's a way for a counterparty to "reneg" which opens up some punishment scenario, and I'd expect hackers to already be looking at this scenario.  Thoughts?
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:32:18
From your description, one concern is that the design will lead to centralization of LN nodes, since businesses would thus prefer to save money by opening a channel with someone with lots of BTC to reconcile their payments.
Also, I'm not really convinced about the security of the entire design.  I am really concerned that hackers will find a way to subvert the entire system.  And, if people are keeping their funds off-chain for long periods of time, the risk seems to go up and up, as the channels deviate more and more from the "single source of truth" -- the blockchain.  I could be totally wrong, just not convinced yet.  I'm still reading about it.  For context, I have background in engineering and comp sci, and I first read SN's whitepaper six years ago.
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:07:52
I'm afraid to challenge this any further without knowing more about the details.  Just trying to objectively understand LN and the implications.  Centralization sounds bad, but IDK yet.  Sounds like there is some type of trust involved on behalf of whoever controls the channels, as well.  Could be wrong, still learning.
