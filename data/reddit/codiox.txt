You claimed that the loss was on individual's accounts, yet you are going to give everyone a haircut. What's the reasoning behind this?

The easiest way is to just send them money via Bitcoin. The hard part if getting those people to learn how to exchange them to local currency.

Bitinka is not currently operating in Venezuela, so those 1000 Bitcoins you said are the daily global volume (for latin america). Check your sources.
@_date: 2016-08-10 21:40:02
yes they did, they suffered a security vulnerability.

Hey guys, Venezuelan here. So the thing is that my country is under a price-control regime. The government forces merchants to sell certain products at ridiculously low prices (much lower than production costs), things like chicken, corn flour (the main caloric source in Vzla), milk, sugar, etc.
Because of this, all those products are impossible to find. Extremely long queues are the norm here,  and people pretty much have to wake up at 3AM to go the supermarket or risk starvation.
On the other hand, the unregulated products (imports and the dishes you see at restaurants) are pretty much impossible to buy for the normal citizen, a MacDonald's Big Mac cost around $5, KFC $4, etc. The MONTHLY minimum wage for a Venezuelan is $30, so you can see that the normal salary can only buy me 6 days of fast food.
The situation is critical, many people with certain skills are working online to survive (coding, designing, music production, etc). That's why I try to teach as many people as I can about Bitcoin, crypto and blockchain technology. On Tuesday I [tried]( explaining to a bunch of college students (Informatics) and teachers about Bitcoin/Blockchain/Ethereum. Spoiler alert, they [liked it](
When you live in a country with triple digit inflation, crazy things can happen. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:32:01
There have been rumours about the possible socialization of the losses, is that even a possibility?
@_date: 2016-08-08 05:53:38
You are asking about organizations or NGO delivering food to people in need? Let me see what i can dig up. 
@_date: 2016-08-10 16:19:00
It seems like the reopened last week. Good to have competition, but not looking forward to operating with an exchange who leaked all its customer's data to the internet. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 01:45:56
I had BTC on Bitfinex, however, they didn't get stolen, they are still under your control. So obviously I'm biased here.

The first choice is to use LocalBitcoin to buy or sell BTC. Same-bank electronic transfers are immediate in Venezuela, so a lot of money gets traded via Localbitcoin. Besides LocalBTC, people simply do P2P trades with trusted counterparties. 
The biggest hurdles for adoption is the lack of centralized or decentralized exchanges that compete between each other to drive fees down. Normal Venezuelans simply earn too little to be able to save money in the first place.

Hi, I'm writer of the article.
As I said in my piece, the biggest hurdle for Bitcoin right now it's the fact that it only has a couple of practical uses. 
Bitcoin needs a stronger local community, we don't have shops or merchants accepting BTC except for P2P trades. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:29:23
It's difficult to work as a freelancer because of the fierce competition. There always someone willing to charge less money than you.
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:27:26
They have API integration with one of the most popular banks in Venezuela, so withdrawals can be near-instant. 
I think I kinda underplayed the relevance of P2P trades on my article, it's also an important part of using Bitcoin in Venezuela.
@_date: 2016-06-05 21:01:13
As a Venezuelan I'm glad to see innovation, however your service has insane levels of KYC/AML policies, I'm not going to hand over my personal information to a company operating in my own country, sadly, it can be easily seized over by the SEBIN (the NSA equivalent in Vzla)
@_date: 2016-11-17 21:55:40
People are buying bitcoin to protect against inflation and currency devaluation.
@_date: 2016-12-18 18:22:55
Hi, the one i have used before is Liberty Express, they are one of the most popular courier services in Venezuela. I don't know if there are better alternatives, but it's the one i have used in the past.
@_date: 2016-11-18 01:02:27
You don't seem to grasp the fact that our currency isn't worth anything. Even if BTC price goes down it will be better to hold it instead of Bolivars.
@_date: 2016-11-29 07:38:59
I'm Venezuelan and I don't see a practical use for this. We should encourage more the use of Bitcoin. Seems over engineered to create a Bolivar token.
@_date: 2016-12-18 07:56:42
He's talking about the electronic banking system, not about Bitcoin, the title is totally bogus.
@_date: 2016-12-18 07:41:13
Yes, I'm located in Venezuela. You can send me a PM to discuss this further. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 21:40:08
Thanks for joining up. It is my belief that Ira's Miller initiative is pretty much useless. You know that USB miners aren't able to produce any significant amount of funds to help a family or even a single individual.
I think we should focus our attention and resources towards more productive initiatives.

Hi there, Venezuelan here. I'm a freelance writer for several cryptocurrency news websites and have covered the Venezuelan situation before. You can check my twitter [here](
Venezuela is a very hard to reach spot for charities, sending medical supplies is pretty much forbidden because the government is trying to deny any humanitarian crisis. 
I have tried to do [my part]( by explaining Bitcoin to my college classmates and professors, as you can see, they [enjoyed]( the presentation. 
The best way to help will be to send small sized packages with supplies (they often get overlooked by customs officials), or directly giving out money. Exchanging Bitcoin to fiat is pretty easy thanks to platforms like Surbitcoin (instant fiat withdrawals with the most popular bank in the country). 
I would gladly volunteer myself to coordinate such actions if the movement gets support here. Personally, I prefer to aid students in public schools and colleges. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 18:51:31
I know a few leaders from Student movements in local colleges/universities, they can help to further coordinate talks or presentations there.

Hola David, ¿hay alguna forma de leer el artículo de forma gratuita?
@_date: 2016-11-17 21:56:26
Yes, but on a local level. Bitcoin Price has double in one month due to currency devaluation and inflation.
@_date: 2016-12-18 18:23:39
Nothing as of now.
@_date: 2016-12-18 08:09:21
There's also the issue that right now the price of bitcoin (and the US dollar) is artificially low in Venezuela because of the whole bill restriction issue. The BTC rate plummeted by 50% in two days, just the month before it was at an all-time-high.
President Maduro just said that the bills will be valid up until January 2. 
Until the price of the dollar goes up, donations will be much more ineffective as merchants already pumped their prices when the black market rates went up 100% in a few days. 
@_date: 2016-12-18 18:53:27
Yes I live in Venezuela, not all packages are confiscated, people are regularly using courier services to send food and small supplies to their families in Venezuela. Packages get confiscated if they are too big.

So you are mad because they didn't email you first. Read the code. Is out there, free to review. 
@_date: 2015-07-13 02:48:59
Bitcoin is becoming an alternative to draconian laws in Latin america countries like Argentina and Venezuela.
@_date: 2017-04-04 04:55:19
The code is ready from day 1. 
@_date: 2015-07-03 08:49:20
Funny thing is, this happened to me before, luckly i found 0.12 BTC when it was 1000US/1BTC. End up with a nice profit of 120 US$ using a HD 6850 for 3 days. If i had kept going.... 
@_date: 2016-09-11 00:03:15
Because at the end of the day you will be paying things with Bolivars.
@_date: 2016-09-16 04:17:34
You should totally come to Venezuela, I can give you a room, then you can experience your socialist utopia. 
Fuck everything about it. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 05:04:33
Hi there, I'm the writer of the article (and also Venezuelan), the price increase is mostly due to our own fiat currency devaluation against the dollar. The local bitcoin market has also experienced an increase in volume.
@_date: 2015-11-06 18:02:10
Don't worry, another funny and sad thing is that the official name of the currency is 'Bolivar Fuerte' which means, Strong Bolivar, jokingly we call it The Weak Bolivar. 
@_date: 2016-05-28 21:22:54
Here in Venezuela we have our on BTC Exchange, it's called Surbitcoin.com
It's super simple and easy to use.
@_date: 2016-05-05 21:39:16
People shouldn't apologize for expressing their opinions.
@_date: 2016-05-07 21:30:12
The country is home of Bitcoin-based company Bitt, they help citizens instantly send money anywhere. 
@_date: 2015-11-06 05:09:08
Just to put things into perspective, the cost of the french fries alone represent the 10% of the MONTHLY wager. 
The fries only costs 700 Bs. The monthly minimum wage is 7900Bs.

"Only La Fiscalía de Venezuela can froze a Bank Account" is a false statements, each day all banks (goverment or private run) freeze suspicious accounts.
Banesco froze SurBitcoin's bank account because some asshole complained to perform a chargeback scam.
@_date: 2016-07-09 03:25:34
The risk is the exchange not liquidating margin calls fast enough. If that happens, people are going to default on their margin borrowing, leaving the lenders in a bad position.
@_date: 2016-07-08 20:26:28
Why are you launching personal attacks? As I already told you I never called Yabit a scam, in fact, I'm in contact with the owner and I know they run a legitimate service. 
You are just trying to get attention on to your altcoin. Go out and see the world, and for gods sake, learn how to write good articles for venbitcoin.com.
@_date: 2016-07-08 20:30:13
Your shitty intimidation tactics don't work, calling me by my real name reflect how desperate you are. I don't hide myself, instead, you remain anonymous while you troll people.
@_date: 2016-07-08 19:18:21
What CoinTelegraph journalist tried to interview you? I work there and as far as I know nobody has ever contacted you.
