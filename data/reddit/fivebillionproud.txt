Yeah, you’re on point. IMO, it sounded like Trump told a staffer what to type, the staffer changed spent 2 minutes changing a few things, and then Trump hit send

Hoarding to sell? You mean right now they’re selling what they were hoarding? If so, I agree. They’re selling now to have enough cash on-hand to cover future expenses in 2020 because miner mob mentality says to hoard through the halving since they’ll be receiving 1/2 of what they normally receive. And if most miners are doing the same, then prices will surge due to mass hoarding. At least I think this is the idea.

Yea, there might not be many people on this sub that think highly of Black Friday. The whole idea just feeds the corporate status quo and consumerism, which is somewhat the opposite of Bitcoin's purpose.

Hey I have a a  few questions Ive always want to know, if you could help:
Can your Bitcoin, Nano, Stellar, etc. wallet on your Ledger generate as many addresses for these individual wallets as you'd like? If so, these will always be associated with the private key, right?
How does Ledger and other hardware wallets tie a bunch of different coins to one sole private key? (This is probably just a technological question that I need to learn more about)
Say you have have a bunch of crypto on a Ledger and you lose that device, but you dont bother backing up your key on a new device. 5 years pass and you decide to back it up, will the key work on any device or just Ledger?
If you delete a random wallet/app(?) on the Ledger, can you just reinstall it to get those funds back?

IMO, people place too much trust in the idea that btc is priced-in before an upcoming halving. Miners will eventually hodl more prior to the halving in anticipation of the reward being cut. But as of this moment, they're selling their rewards as well as those who got in early, because if you have hundreds or thousands of btc, this is an attractive selling price at the moment. It's only a matter of time until it really starts rising, and the miners and whales collectively see that the market is ready to hodl more, combine that with all the people who now have the Square Cash app and aren't even aware of what a halving is and get FOMO, and you got a recipe for a bull run.

Hey thanks for the response. I was just on the Ledger site this morning looking around at supported apps and learning more. The X just went on sale, so I think I'm ready to pick one up.

Yea, in other words, he gave his son enough money as a Christmas or birthday gift and said, "Son, maybe you should buy some Bitcoin for us. Don't tell anyone I said this. That way, I can just say only you have Bitcoin and not me when talking shit about it."

Terrific! Thanks for the insight.

At what point do you believe Square will start allowing Btc payments on their registers? I saw an article from last year that they won a patent to accept it on their network, so I'm curious if or when this gets implemented.

Let me add to this that by 2032, 99% of all bitcoin that will ever exist will have entered circulation. Mining the last 1% won’t be complete until the 22nd century

here’s an article on this.
And yeah, I may have misheard about rejection but I could have sworn I heard that. I’ll have to find the story and get back to you. Hopefully, they’ll release a written article
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:43:16
Just listened to a story on NPR about the state of fiat in Zimbabwe after the hyperinflation in 2008, and they mentioned that some shops there are rejecting the US Dollar. The USD is losing its dominant position around the globe. This is good for bitcoin.

I projected that the 19th millionth coin will be mined around April 2022.

As of May, less than 732K. Some have multiple addresses. 
Edit: Also, a lot of these are companies
@_date: 2019-06-21 18:51:51
Yep, another thing to consider is that many of these wallets are inaccessible from people forgetting their passwords or losing hard drives, so I would guess the number of individuals who have access to 1 btc would be a few hundred thousand less than this.

Based on the first two halvings, 10 months out is when it really starts going up

If it were me, I'd probably decide how much of that you want to put into crypto and break it up into 4 quarters to dollar-cost-average in over the next 4 months before the halving. 25% if you were to get set up in January, then 25% on the first of each month from February-April.
@_date: 2019-12-03 03:29:56
I calculated sometime around 2095.

I'm considering a tattoo on the inside part of my buttcheeks and telling my family to look there in case I die. It decreases the chance that the coroner will steal your crypto since they probably won't know to look there.

I'd be curious to know what % of people who are invested in BTC are at least aware of the halving design and what that could mean for its future value. I'd guess 20-30%
