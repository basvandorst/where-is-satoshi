So, for us that don’t understand TA, what does this mean?

For anyone interested to read about it, here is the “white paper”

That sounds very scientific /s 
Wanna make a bet? Otherwise, your prediction is as worthless as all the other predictions. When you guys are wrong, you delete the post and/or your account and pretend you never said anything. I have seen to many of you people before.

It’s not a bet if you are not willing to risk anything. 
I bet your mother will take your virginity. It is as valid as your bet/prediction. 
Edit: *your father will take it

Duh... what a bunch of nonsense. The guy that bought the apartment with bitcoin would otherwise have to sell his bitcoin for USD, then buy the apartment and the seller would need to rebuy bitcoin for his USD. 
In theory, the price of bitcoin would be suppressed more that way, because if the fees the exchanges would extract.

For the lulz: salty BCashers have reported this to the mods ��

It is a scam and as soon as they go open market (they probably never will, they have been saying that for years and always postpone the dates) it will loose around 99.9% of its value.
What amazes me the most is that "Dr" Ruja, and a lot of other top people in onecoin have  background in other ponsiz scams. And people still trust them in this one!

How many confirmed users of bitcoin do we have now?
@_date: 2017-08-05 18:20:29
Nope. 100% real, look at the tweet at their own twitter :)
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:19:09
Actually. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 08:45:08
This will be the best advice anyone can give you: no one knows.
I personally think the price of bitcoin will be way higher in a couple of years. But I, and everyone else, have no clue. 
Good luck!

If coinbase have 6 million accounts and Blockchain.info have 16 million, we probably have at least a couple of million users already.

This weekend, I introduced my neighbour to bitcoin. I sent him 1 euro worth of bitcoins and showed him how awesome it is and how ultrafast you can do payments to whomever you want (and all the other things that makes bitcoin awesome, like being your own bank, owning your money and so on). He then wanted to try to send the 1 euro back to me. Our fees were on average 0.1 euros, so for sending one euro to him and back did cost 0.2 euros or 20% as he saw it.  The first thing he said was: that is really expensive! And now he is done with bitcoin and very happy with his fiat.
I know, we can argue all day that he is a moron, Im a bad teacher - and many other reasons. But, at the end of the day - the fees MUST be lower if we want bitcoin to go mainstream. If it is with bigger blocks or segwit (or any other solution) I care less about. But, when it cost around 10% to send 1 euro in a single transaction (and that I think will be an average transaction in the developing world), then I sadly believe bitcoin will never be adopted by the masses.

GoodPhoto, how much have you lost now on your shorting positions? :D hahahahahaha in your face!!! 1000 dollars baby! 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:24:43
No, read what I wrote again or go back to school.

Have Roger lost most of his coins?  When? A year ago it were estimated he had between 300.000-400.000 bitcoins. That’s 2.4 - 3.2 billion dollars in today’s value. 
Also: awesome posts. I hereby give the same promise: I will NEVER attack the network. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:11:55
Probably the other way around. Bitcoin can’t be censored, so every thing else that get censored actually makes bitcoin even more unique and valuable.

It’s an opposite of an endorsement, yet still an endorsement he (and you obviously) doesn't realize.

What a coincidence! I got a 5 euro bill as exchange with the same message but with this address instead: 18h1GdgdGBJCcHmC3nW95GQiKyaQBiCica (link:  )
Maybe someone will send BTC to that address instead?
