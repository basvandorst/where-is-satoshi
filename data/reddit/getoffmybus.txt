Exactly, take precautions and generate new seed phrases :/

And if I had bought it at $3-$10, I definitely would have sold around the $100-$1000 range
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:15:11
Buy high sell low

*sigh* everyone should take precautions when setting these up

Wait wait, I can short USDT, how?

What kind of information are you talking about? I'm not asking what the information *was*, just what type of information he put up that's risky to have in the open. Date of birth, home address, social security number? Hopefully not that last one..

I know I'm in the wrong sub for this but hopefully you weren't transferring using BTC. ETH transfer fees are incredibly cheap compared to BTCs. However, transferring out is free (I think, regardless of which coin) if you use Coinbase's web program gdax.com. Where the coin matters is when you're moving from the 2nd exchange back to gdax, you'll most likely pay a fee
Buy on Coinbase&gt;transfer to gdax(also free)&gt;transfer to 2nd exchange&gt;buy altcoins
When you're ready to cash out
Sell altcoins for ETH(or BTC/BCH/LTC) on 2nd exchange&gt; withdrawal to gdax&gt;gdax to Coinbase(free)&gt;trade for FIAT and you're good to go
The only fee you should encounter is when you withdrawal *from* the secondary exchange to gdax. ETH seems to be the all around cheapest/fastest depending on the exchange, but BTC wouldn't be so bad as you're paying the fee one time. All up to you.

So when she asks you to share remind her how she explicitly stated it was your money ;)
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:57:47
They're not the best in terms of reliability, but they're the best in terms of simplicity. If you can, I'd used gdax.com, owned by Coinbase, has cheaper fees than the Coinbase app. You can use the Coinbase app to monitor and buy/sell on the go, but for bigger buys/sells I'd use gdax.com

@_date: 2017-12-11 16:19:46
So we can't trade if it's halted?
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:20:05
I have a hard time seeing how this can take off as an actual currency until entire countries essentially decide on one coin to adopt into average trade. Fact of the matter is, as it stands, there are tons of things that won't be able to be purchased without FIAT. At the very minimum, I don't see anyone being able to pay their taxes with any coins unless the government gets involved in making a coin. Which I kind of do imagine that governments are going to make their own blockchain coin and thats what the majority of people will cling to. I don't see this overthrowing any governmental powers or financial institutions. 
Sure, it could be incredibly ground breaking, but I mean, come on, people talk about how these coins will make banks obsolete but Ripple has already joined the party.

We should push this to the republicans. Since they're against gay marriage because the old testimony specifically detests it, surely they'll lobby to make interest loans illegal! /s
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:06:47
Haha, I had never even thought of my username like that before. It's actually completely unrelated but an interesting observation. 
What I meant by "(taxes are necessary) to a certain extent" is that, as much as society pays in taxes, a lot of it goes to waste. I'm somewhat torn on universal healthcare, it seems most of what the government gets involved in ends up lowering in quality. However, I'm not necessarily opposed, but I don't think anyone's come close to figuring out a good implementation or good way to fund it. 
No easy answers for any of it really

If payday is Friday and OP is spent, doesn't have much control over it. Unless they want to sell personal assets to buy bitcoin, and I don't think that's a very good habit to start...

That's exactly what I think is terrifying. It's also exciting, though! I don't have an insane amount in. If it does well, I'll make a decent profit and be happy, if not, oh well.

People should stop feeling pressured to go to college, honestly. If you want to, great, but I feel like a lot of people think there's no other option
Edit: also, community colleges for 2 years and transferring to a cheaper 4 year can save you a ton of money

What exchange medium do you use for buy limit orders?

Coinbase seems to be the most convenient one though
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:48:10
The fees confuse me so far, is there a minimum fee on each transaction? On my first transaction I bought $20 of bitcoin and it charged me a $1.49, which isn't exactly 1.9% of $20. I did this one with my bank account. When I added my credit card, I did another transaction of the same price of $20, charged $1.49 (yes I'm sure it was the credit card).  
It listed the fee at $0.99 for $10 of BTC (almost 10%). A $7.34 fee for $500 of BTC (1.4-1.5%). A $14.68 fee for $1,000 of BTC (% consistent with $500 of BTC). 
Where's this 3.5%/1.9% number taken from and how would I notice a difference in fees on bank account v credit card? Is my math just horrible off? I have to be missing something.

I plan on using gdax when it's convenient. I don't mind paying a little higher in fees when I'm on the go and can't access a computer

What if Satoshi caused the crash. He kept his 1million coins up safe until it hit $20,000, and very slowly puts them back in the market as he watches the price drop dramatically. It's the ultimate exit scheme bruh, mainly because no one knows who he is, or whether or not he's actually responsible
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:51:45
Flair checks out ;)
Joking, though, kind of agree with you. Imagine if at 8am, your $1 bill was actually worth $2.50, by 12pm it was worth $5, and by 6pm... $0.25. It's just not feasible for daily use imo. I'd love for someone to explain how I'm wrong and how currency would still be usable even with incredible volatility, genuinely.

Be carefully trusting friends, you may have known them all your life but even something as little as $1,000 will do crazy things to people if they believe no one will ever know...
Edit: not to say you *shouldn’t* trust your friend, some people are good people, but definitely think more than once about it

Wishful thinking, but like I said, if bitcoin drops below a dollar, it's worth even less because something catastrophic would have happened to bitcoin

Won't go below $250-$500 at the worst imo, but I've been wrong before. To see a $0 BTC would have to lose all confidence from everyone.
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:53:50
$1,500-$3,500 for sure

Yeah for sure, I'd invest in several stocks as well but Bitcoin might be the easiest with the highest return back then
