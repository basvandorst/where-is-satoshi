I’d suggest you send me 1 BTC. Just for the heck of it. Then I’d assist you in moving here in the Philippines. No taxation on Bitcoin + everything is cheap + you get to get away from your extremely toxic family. 
Seriously, get away from your family if they keep on acting like that

This looks awesome! Checking it out with a pc wishing for a mobile one

Yeah was about to. But I moved the crypto to my mobile wallet as I was about to cash out to pay for something on the weekend. Fell asleep and wasn’t able to do it last night. Woke up getting scammed.

This might be the case. If you can see the images ive attached it seems like it was some sort of ip. There were no verifications or anything that asked me of and everything happened when I clicked the link. Could indeed be a remote hack.

Thanks mate for the suggestion. Had it edited out. It still stings tho but only I’m the one to blame.
@_date: 2019-06-05 04:09:31
Makes perfect sense now. Seems like I fell victim to phishing.

It was some sort of prompt for the yearly bonus that my coins.ph gives off. Clicked on it and im dead

Seems i got downvoted but here’s the email i was pertaining to. [scam email image](
@_date: 2019-06-05 00:12:05
That’s though. Quite a huge amount. Shit.

The wallet is coins.ph something we use in the Philippines. I didn’t initiate the transaction and im not sure what happened. I realized I was scammed after 2 minutes when my balance updated.
@_date: 2019-06-05 00:45:09
Nah mate. I’m really not sure what happened. You’re more than welcome to try but here’s the link from the email. [scam image link this is an img btw]( could be a targeted attack.

Thank you for clearing this one out. Makes perfect sense now I thought it was all of a magic from a link. Seems like they got my credentials.
@_date: 2019-06-05 00:06:50
Yes it was a mobile wallet. I plan on transferring them last night on converting them to fiat to put into my bank acct to pay for my mom’s hospital bill. But yeah. Fuck. Mom’s probably gonna die now shit. 
Not sure how but the link seemed to point to an ip and poof next thing you know everything’s gone and it did not ask me for any sort of confirmation.
