With the Defi ecosystem that is being built around Eth I believe we’ll see it gain more traction.

Let’s see in 2 years, which one has gone up the most
@_date: 2019-07-27 07:15:47
Nice!!!  But what a poorly written article.
@_date: 2019-07-31 02:17:52
Thank you!!  Yes, the sheople simply can’t understand Bitcoin. They are too brainwashed.
@_date: 2019-07-27 07:20:41
Buy Ethereum, not BTC, greater upside potential

When the market goes down they alway have news to explain it, same when the market goes up...

Man, people in this space seem to forget what crypto is all about and keep bending over the the irs even for 5 dollars
@_date: 2019-08-12 12:50:44
Nice!! I used to live on that street. If I knew...I would have certainly stopped by to pay in btc!!
@_date: 2019-08-12 17:31:16
I think a good idea for you is to also accept other cryptos, example ethereum, etc...
@_date: 2019-08-15 15:16:49
Paycheck arriving tomorrow, all into crypto!

Porto or Lisbon for me

Holy shit, is that in Champaign IL?

I think once there is true descentralization, there is no  need to regulate. Markets are self regulating by nature. It may hurt in the short term, but in the long term there is homeostasis in the market.

Yes I would, it’s crypto and it’s fostering adoption.
@_date: 2019-10-30 02:00:42
Because of people like you that bend over to the irs that crypto exists, fuck the irs, once I’m dealing solely in crypto I could care less
@_date: 2019-10-25 12:30:40
I’m not praising their brand, I’m praising the fact they are fostering adoption, if you don’t like their service, you don’t need to use them. I feel a bunch of other exchanges charges outrageous fees, that will decrease over time.

Glad you took the time to go through my history, you certainly have nothing else to do.
@_date: 2019-12-06 02:09:27
BTC obviously you will by 10 in a few years
@_date: 2019-12-09 22:20:24
No shit Sherlock
@_date: 2019-12-05 15:33:09
I guess all the feminists will soon complain about how they were not recommended to buy crypto and demand equality in crypto! Lol

How is this incel?
@_date: 2019-12-05 21:33:45
I can assure you I have no problem with my sex life, or finding girlfriends.
