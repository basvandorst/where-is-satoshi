maybe bitcoin will one day become as pervasive as IP but it's a long way from that yet and already has competition that works just as well or better (even if only marginally) and is also evolving in parallel.

This is actually pretty funny.. can you just pay the GBP to someone else on OKPay who didn't tick the box (since they didn't do a bank wire - but received money from you for umm.. whatever good/services rendered) and then they forward it directly to btc-e?

maybe.. I'm not really sure though.. most bitcoin accepting companies don't accept it directly, but through bitpay.. what if bitpay addopted litecoin or some other altcoin? suddenly they're not far behind anymore. Also it's alot easier for altcoins to recruit existing crypto users from bitcoin than it is for bitcoin to recruit new users from the general population.. similarly if people start using ripple then all altcoins get full penetration at once due to the automatic conversion system.

Yea.. they say that now.. but even if they maintain that position their competitors won't - and I doubt they will either in the end.
edit: mtgox has already said they will adopt ltc - they offer a competing merchant service similar to bitpay. others are bound to follow.. eventually bitpay will lose customers due to not supporting altcoins and will change their position or become irrelevant. I agree that it's already pretty easy to trade altcoins for bitcoins yourself in order to frequent bitcoin accepting merchants.. this will become easier as more gateway services appear. 
There might be something in what you say with friction, but I'm not really sure.. since most merchants probably convert their BTC to USD anyway you could say the same thing about bitcoin itself.. my initial feeling is that other factors will overshadow this effect in the short term and probably well into the future too.

maybe once the dollar collapses and fed goes away income tax won't be necessary to pay the debt anymore..

Eh.. everyone is totally misreading this stuff imo.. all governments are following the same policy which is to keep bitcoin in the realm of individual people. In europe it's been done using VAT and in the US using money transmitter laws.. in China the central bank just issued a decree telling their banks to stay out. 
Right now bitcoin is tiny, if it is opened up to large financial firms there will be no revolution.. sure a few 10s of thousands of us would get filthy rich but that wasn't why bitcoin was created. If it is to succeed it needs to grow a much larger userbase of *people* before any large money gets involved.

well that's just like you're opinion man :p I disagree - but time will tell.. I have a much larger position in btc than I do in ltc but I just don't see bitcoin's first mover advantage as being as big as a lot of people say. In absolute terms hardly anyone uses bitcoin (or any cryptos) so it's not that big of a head start.. if someone does come up with a zerocoin altcoin that provides real anonymity that will definitely see huge adoption for example. Bitcoin does grease the rails by providing a way to do irreversible payments online - it's very easy to make crypto-&gt;crypto exchanges and I really don't think it's a foregone conclusion that everyone will save in BTC just because it was first.

Would this preclude say alipay from accepting bitcoin?
