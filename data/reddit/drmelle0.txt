dumb question, how does sending without being online work?
@_date: 2019-10-29 01:07:46
oh, ok, i get it, airgapped, but other machine online.
i now use electrum behind an electrum personal server on linux box, running a full node, with a ledger nano s. i think the ledger is the 'offline pc' doing the signing? or is this less safe than using seperate , one offline boxes?

Recently got a Linux node running, full archival, with electrum and EPS. Had to upgrade my Internet plan with my isp for the bandwidth usage, but well worth it. :)
With the current number of nodes, I suggest everyone with a spare box to do the same.

Coincidence that this is around block height 600k? Or is that by design? Will these numbers coincide?
@_date: 2019-10-19 21:42:48
Doing lighting when electrum supports it, next update. Ufw, is it needed? I don't use the box for anything else but btc
@_date: 2019-10-18 23:04:53
Logic would suggest by design, since the the payout per block is constant?

Dca will profit you, so you go you.
But I've found buying the dip and hodl has yielded me more. And that's without knowledge of markets and trading, just by gut feeling of highs and lows. Don't take this as trustworthy advice.

isn't it "not your keys, not your bitcoin" ?  
i didn't code anything, but my bitcoin are mine in a ledger nano s

Honest question, what makes bch a shitcoin? I know how Roger is a douche in his ways of operation, but I've seen a lot of zealotry on the r/btc and I still don't really get the beef. It's an altcoin like there are a lot, what makes it fundamentally worse than the original besides adoption. Is it centralised in any way? Or "rigged" by the ver guy?
Not trolling, trying to get it
@_date: 2019-09-13 16:01:52
well, then again, ledger being public does not give govt insight in your transactions, if they cant link your wallet to you...
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:02:41
ah, i see, could be worth the risk if you sell to ppl you trust

Going by your username, did you buy dogecoin?
@_date: 2019-09-24 23:53:42
My only regret is that I have only so much fiat to buy the dip.
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:47:18
i don't understand your plan. who would you be selling to that wants to pay 15-20% above market price ?
