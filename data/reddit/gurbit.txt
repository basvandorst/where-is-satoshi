i felt the same too but i feel like the longer i say that the more i regret not buying into it. i bought my first amount of BTC just last night, great feeling having that security. I only bought about 0.1 though, but planning to buy more next week.

Lol still lost, im using a paper wallet and have been using the same public key. And the same broker ( coin base) what exactly is 'changing'?  Only thing different is when i bought it and the amount im transferring.

honestly, every year since 2012, i always said i would buy BTC. And every year i get more regretful for not going in on sooner. There is so much more potential for growth, I would definitely buy into it asap if I were you.
just last night i did my first BTC transaction and bought 0.1 BTC, im a broke student, but im planning to invest more with my next upcoming paycheques.

I dont really understand what youre saying in the second paragraph. So if i wanted to send 10 btc to my wallet. The supplier (coinbase) will send 12 btc and i send back 2 btc? Im not entirely sure if that is what you are getting at.

I have a 'paper' wallet. With the private key, is that all i need to be able to make transactions? Im hoping to hold onto it long term so i wont be making any buys or sells with it.
