Doesn't matter if the payment volume increases.  That's not what it's for.  Its purpose is to grant alodial rights to wealth.

I think China did not get  btc ... even from the start of the frenzy in November.   I think China had such a massive effect on the price because it was massively easier for Chinese to buy than anywhere else in the world because of preexisting infrastructure.  Chinese bought to gamble, not because they understand the significance of the blockchain.

"Bitcoin needs to provide new currency abillities"
Wow.  How about nearly free instant payment to anyone, anywhere?
How about allodial title to wealth?
How about 100% fungibility?   
If these don't seem like problems to you, you probably have never had a significant amount of wealth, and by significant I mean more than a few hundred thousand dollars.
Bitcoin is not about micropayments.  It's about megapayments.

But is that easy compared to signing up for a wallet on blockchain.info?  I think signing up for a blockchain wallet is much easier than opening a bank account and waiting to get your debit card and 4 digit pin in the mail.  Some nerd down the street will pay you in btc to mow their lawn, and then you get to spend that on a new xbox game from TigerDirect.

Just try it.  It's a different (and, I believe, better) experience than paying by CC.  You don't have to type in your CC and worry about whether they keep it or not, or how securely they keep it if they do.
I will soon be getting paid via Bitcoin, so it will actually be easier for me to buy things via TigerDirect with BTC than with a CC.    I will be eating the 1% Coinbase fee when accepting my income via BTC, but that is something I'm willing to put up with given the longer term rise in value I predict for BTC.

His writing style is *intentionally* trigger laden.  Also quite difficult to understand if you don't hunt down his references or know the dictionary definition of most words.
He does not intend to appeal to the reddit crowd in general, but targets a more specific crowd - one that can make it past the triggers, and who can do (or already has done) the reading necessary to understand the references.  He's aiming to get Taleb types into

A note on Bitmarkets - yes there is no reputation system, but that is because it uses 2-party escrow to balance incentives instead.  It just doesn't make sense to try to scam on Bitmarkets, so no reputation system is needed.
Also, yes, it is Mac only, but if you're going to be keeping Bitcoin on a running computer for god's sake don't keep it on a Windows machine.
If you're running linux - kudos, your coins are probably somewhat safe depending on your opsec, but you are in a tiny tiny minority of computer users, and an even tinier minority of computer users who want to buy/sell stuff for Bitcoin.
Also please let me know about *any* other p2p market places that you can install on *any* computer and view and post *any* listings on in the next 10 minutes.

That page could use some serious design tweeks.  The wall of centered text is ghastly.  I would align the logos vertically on the left and then left align the text with maybe a paragraph or two taking up 2/3 of the right side.

Well, take buying stuff on the web for an example.  Instead of filling out a form with all of my personal info -- my address, CC etc. (which is not only tedious but also unsafe), I can just copy paste a bitcoin address into Coinbase, enter the amount, and hit send.  This is similar to the convenience you get from using Paypal, but it's cheaper.
In person transactions are similarly fluid, and I also feel more in control.  I just scan a qr code, enter an amount and voila! Paid.  I don't have to swipe my card, select debit/credit, enter my pin, choose not to donate to some cause, enter my phone number, decline cash back, etc.  And **I get to set the amount**.

The obvious problem with giftcards is that it's hard to spend all of the money on them.  Usually there's some small amount left over that expires and goes to back to the vendor -- it's a hidden tax and I suspect it really adds up.

I'm not sure this is a market place chan.  This is the HOWTO:
THIS SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY UNDER DEPLOYMENT AND IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME UNTIL IT FULLY WORKS
The public folder structure can be accessed by everyone on the mail system. Users can put their messages in it and provide offerings for various services or create a public textboard.
All users can see the content of Messages in the  folder structure. Be very careful, what you put in it.
How to publish content
1. Open The squirrel webmail system on 
2. Write a message and save it as draft.
3. move the message into the correct public structure (and optionally inform a mod of your message). Usually the !Unmoderated folder is the only folder you have write access to.
Folder layout
Moderated sections contain:
!Unmoderated: This is the queue, where you can put your messages in.
!Info: Folder with informations about the group and rules on how to use it.
Other folders are approved messages.
Create a section
Users can request any sort of folder from the admin (admin Each folder contains at least an "!Unmoderated" folder. Users can put their content in it and a moderator will check it and (if appropriate) move it to its correct destination folder. See rules in the !Info folder.
Moderator status is granted to the creator of a section. The Mod can then contact the admin to enable other users for moderation.
Answering a message
If you want to answer a message or contact the author for other reasons, you simply open the message and reply to it.
Editing and deleting
You cannot directly edit messages. You can however copy and paste the content in a new Message.
To delete a message ask a mod to do so. You obviously need to do this from your own address.

Once you start actually paying for stuff with bitcoin you realize how nice it is, and you want to do it for everything.  It's hard to understand unless you've actually made some real transactions with Bitcoin.  Every time I buy something with btc I'm less and less willing to pay by cc/debit.

Napster was not decentralized.  Unlike bittorrent (and bitcoin), it relied on a central server that could be shut down.
@_date: 2013-04-20 19:42:24
It appeared to me that the web serevers were being ddosed  this time.  Since that can be done anonymously, that seems to be a more likely way to attempt to manipulate the market than via api abuse.  Also I believe gox recently implemented rate limiting which should prevent a ddos via the api.
