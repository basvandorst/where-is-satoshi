Make sure you have gcc &gt; 4.8.x (minimum requirement version from core 0.16.0 onwards)

Let me know if you get it working.

Not looked into it too much but from first glance it seems like you need to call the getAccount function while supplying the address of the account you want to use. Said function should return the account name associated with the bitcoin address you supplied. Pass that string as another parameter to getNewAddress. If you are using a default account then the account name will just be an empty string according to the docs. If you already know the account name then ignore the first part of what I just said and pass it as a string parameter to getNewAddress. Hope I was clear.

I would just download the binaries and compare signatures rather than trying to compile yourself.

You should start selling these enclosures. I was looking for a good one that can hold a drive aswell as the pi. Although I wont be using an LCD for mine so I would make that cutout optional if I were you.

export BDB_PREFIX=$(pwd)/db4
./configure BDB_LIBS="-L${BDB_PREFIX}/lib -ldb_cxx-4.8" BDB_CFLAGS="-I${BDB_PREFIX}/include" CXXFLAGS="--param ggc-min-expand=1 --param ggc-min-heapsize=32768" --enable-cxx --without-gui --disable-shared --with-pic --enable-upnp-default
I just looked on a pi guide for compiling and his commands look very different to yours. The ggc-min-heapsize cxxflag seems very important for a raspberry pi because it doesn't have much ram. The lack of this flag might be causing the segmentation error (I'm quite sure this error is something to to with memory)
Source: 
You might need to scroll down a bit as the compilation is later on in the guide. It gives options for compiling with the intention of using a wallet and also without.
EDIT: Actually all the CXXFLAGS seem very important for a raspberry pi. Read  for more information. It helps you compile on Linux without blindly pasting commands.
$(pwd) is equivalent to "user/local" (you can double check this by echoing $(pwd) and reacting accordingly) therefore you will have to replace "/db4" with your actual BerkleyDB directory.

Any new error logs after doing that? Also install gawk, although I am unsure it is actually required.

 go to the fourth section of this guide and try to follow along. He is using a pi3 aswell so same architecture, same binaries. It assumes you are using a drive rather than an sdcard for the blockchain. You actually might be better off starting from scratch and following the whole thing. He uses raspi stretch lite for the OS.

Look for a binary compiled for ARM processor

The bitcoin part of the guide I sent you assumes that you have two users, one called admin (I am assuming this is a user with root perms) and a user called bitcoin which is used to create the symlink of the blockchain. This is the confusing part, hard to grasp unless you follow the whole thing from scratch. You probably know more about your environment than I do and which steps to mitigate.. The main idea is that it shows you how to download the binaries and sigs and verify the checksum of the file then validate the signatures. It is bitcoin 0.16.3 (I think this is the version that patched the inflation bug) but you can change the wget links aslong as you use the right binaries for your ARM processor.

Try putting spaces after -I and -L
