Yeah that smells pretty bad.  I assume you are writing your own bitcoin full node package (since your shuffling private keys).  That is a pretty big bite to take.  I'd suggest you seriously look at some API centric full nodes like [bitcore](  It offers tons of services, which increases risk, but it may be a security model (angular) that is more familiar to a broader group of developers.  Definitely better than writing your own bitcoin node.
@_date: 2018-01-21 06:50:50
Guess I can't think of a single reason in the world to actually take the key out of bitcore at all.  Bitcore locks the private keys in memory and uses them to do its magic.... why mess with that.
Now if your asking about the mnemonic (totally different thing that), then I wouldn't manage that at all.
Generate it cold, and back it up non-digitally.  Pen and paper, then lock it in a safe.  Making digital backups or replicas of key material is where you'll get bit.
Some people will assign three key officers to hold the 24 word mnemonic.  Each would get 8 words, and store them in different offsite safes.

I thought replay protection protected BTC from replaying coinX TXNs.  I never saw (or realized) how it protects valid BTC TXNs from remaining on the BTC network.
There would have to be a "valid-till" field in the TXN, and I can't find any such field.  Open to schooling if I missed it.

Don't listen to them... you can get a lot of bite for logging some hours of work for yourself, assuming you live in the US.
1. Figure out who regulates Coinbase (about 5 agencies, FenCERN is only one of them).
2. Write all the parties in [1] a letter with lots of charts, screenshots and diagrams making the case for how you got ripped off.
3. Figure out if your Congressman is 'R' or 'D'.
4. Go to the party headquarters for your Congressman 'R' or 'D' and register yourself for that party (aka whore yourself).
5. Send your Congressman and Senator some $5 donation, but make damn sure you fill in your email, address and cell phone numbers with all your real live info.
6. Call your Congressman at their district office and tell them your story of woah... Say you wanted to use the 5k to take you and your family up to DC to inspire your children to pursue a job as a legislator since you see public service as the highest calling.  Ask if you can schedule a face-to-face appointment with the congressman or his staff.
7. Give the operator all the correct contact info so that you show up as a registered 'R' or 'D' and that you show up as a campaign contributor.
8. When you meet with their staff (you wont meet the congressman), give them your binder of letters and proof you wrote up and wax on and on how all the federal agencies in [1] ignored you.  Act perplexed at how this was possible since these were the great people's protectors, and how it surely must have been some error that precludes these federal agents from leaping into action.
If you can manage to get to [8] without puking then the congressman's staff will write all the agencies in [1] a letter basically saying "WTF... get off your ass".  Then you will start getting calls / letters within a week of 8.
ETA from 1 to 8 is about 2 months if you haul ass.
This is basically exactly how I avoided a Tax attorney when the IRS billed me for someone else's return.  White knuckle ride the whole way.

Supply and demand.
1. Supply = The number of TXN that will fit in each block
2. Demand = The number of people wanting [1]
As the price fell, some of the less hardy FOMO investors stop buying and there was less demand = less TXN = lower [2].

INACPA, but I think it works like this...
1. Buy $1000 of BTC at dip.
2. Sell for $1200 USD at tip.
3. Declare $200 short term gains.
-- or --
1. Buy 0.1 BTC at dip for $1000 (with BTC/USD @ $10,000)
2. Buy BTC/LTC @ 0.015 (with BTC/USD @ $10,100 , LTC/USD @ $150)
3. Sell LTC/USD @ $210 for $1,400
You've got $500 in short term gains.
$100 gains from [1-2]
$400 gains from [2-3]
Note that if you look at dollar in dollar out, you **really** only achieved $400 in gains, but are taxed for $500 in gains.  This is why not-like-kind sucks.
But... I don't know what the hell I'm talking about... so ask your accountant.

Anyone know details of the purchase.
* What was purchased (can't read it)
* What layer 2 channel was used?
* Was the channel p2p or routed through hubs?
* If through hubs, which hubs?
I've read the LN papers, but think I'm really missing something here.  My understanding of LN workflow was:
1. Two parties secure funds in layer 1.
2. Two parties do many transactions on layer 2.
3. Two parties close channel on layer 1.
4. Fees are the aggregate of [1-3].
Now I further realize that like other mesh network coins, LN allows friend-of-a-friend type connections.  With this type of network people can channel their payments through someone else channel, so it doesn't have to be P2P.

Findings thus far...
A bundled TXN would have much of the same data as a non-bundled TXN but would save on the following fields:
* version - always 16 wu
* segwit-marker - always 1 wu
* segwit-flag - always 1 wu
* input-count - typically 4 wu
* output-count - typically 4 wu
* locktime - always 16 wu.
So that saves 42 wu, or about 8% on small 530 wu TXN, or less on larger TXN.  So likely between 4%-8%
Add segwit to this we've achieved about a 60% reduction.

So if I pay the 2000 sat TXN fee to open a ~~100~~ 100000 sat channel with silkroute I get ~~10~~ 10000 sat.  To claim my ~~10~~ 10000 sat, all I have to do is pay the 2000 sat TXN fee to close the channel.
Is my math right? (I realize TXN fees are a bit more than 2000 sat right now, but they are falling, so who knows).

Hard to gauge your knowledge level from the post.  Obviously google provided you:
1. [Windows]( - Rackspace security for dummies
2. [Linux]( - Rackspace security for dummies
3. [Mac / Android]( - LOL
For [1] I'd add, run server-core not the GUI.  Avoiding the gui will lower (slightly) the attack surface of your server providing a bit more security (through obscurity).
For `bitcoind` itself ensure that JSONRPC is running over SSL.  Make the userid and PW are some random strings generated by a password generator.  Don't use anything that can be memorized, since it can be easily guessed.
My gut tells me that Linux may offer better security, but Windows Server installs have really gotten pretty solid over the last 10 years.
Get an AMD server to mitigate your exposure to Spectre and Meltdown.  I'm not convinced that AMD is as immune as they claim, but its a start.
Also, give some real thought to your topology.  What ISP your using and how reliable their DNS services and such are.  If your system is impenetrable, it might not be hard to launch a DNS spoof attack.
By and large, the only secure system is one whose network jack is unplugged.  Best you can hope for is to have as few leaks as possible.

Last time I asked questions on r/economics or r/badeconomics I lost about 50% of my karma in one week.  Knock yourself out, but I'd recommend a trash account before you do.


It's from a book... "When currency dies".  Basically back in 1920 or so, Germany's inflation went exponential.  The book pointed out some interesting things about the wealthy... they stayed wealthy. The reason was that clever people put all their money in the stock market.  That's why the German gov't set around like Nero while their country burned.  They literally could care less.  All their money was in stock.
Now our federal Gov't is a hella lot more sympathetic to the plight of the middle class than the 1930 proto-nazi party, but its an interesting parallel.  When a heavily regulated currency falls on its face while the equity market gets lifetime high score, couldn't help thinking of that book.

# Goal
My goal (perverse though it may be), is to get bitcoin or other forks running in very small VSPs.  This isn't really for VSPs (though it may be), but is really for SOC or other mico compute environments.  Ultimately this can be encapsulated into a minimalist docker container.  The system I was targeting has 0.5 CPU, 0.6 GB of memory and 25 GB of disk.
# Observations
I found some interesting things out along the way that may be of interest to people tweeking bitcoin.
 dbcache limits
Since I don't have the requisite memory required to run the node, I've limited memory using the `dbcache` parameter.  Settings range from 100 to 150 depending on what other settings I have in place.
 0.15.1 mallocs
I don't know what changed in 0.15.1 but it seems much more memory hungry than previous releases.  Throughout the tuning process, I continually had either bitcoind quit due to memory allocation failures (logged in debug.log), or simply terminated by the OS because it attempted a malloc when no pages where left (logged in /var/log/syslog).  This looks very similar to an issue tha twas logged against 0.14 that was patched in 0.14.1.  My ultimate solution was to downgrade to 0.14.2 which seems to work great.
 prune compromise
My initial thoughts were to use `prune=550` to use the least amount of disk space possible.  I found out that even on 0.14.2 this causes memory to fill up quick.  I found making the pruning less agressive with a setting of `prune=10240` seems to be a good compromise for what I need done.
 blocksonly avoidance
I had thought to save some memory by using blocksonly.  For some reason, on 0.14.2, this causes more problems than it solves.  I had a hard time finding any config where `blocksonly` would work.  Surprisingly, `maxmempool=5` does effectively the same thing for the miserly cost of 5MiB of memory.
 serial consoles
Seems rediculous, but on my VSP, if bitcoind was running full speed, I would have a hard time connecting through SSH.  There were other SSH clients and connection methods that seemed to work better.  By far the quickest connections when under heavy utilization was to connect directly to serial ports.  I wrote a small snippet to enable extended serial consolse on my systemd install. 
# Scripts
I made a few scripts durring the process as the needs arose.  They are very utilitarian, and could do with some major overhauls, but they did what I needed done at the time I needed it.
* ttyX.sh - Add systemd ttySx access for S1-S3
* hack.sh - fix VS Xlib issue with bitcoin-qt
* xstart.btc - run a very slim Xwindows session for bitcoin-qt
* canary.sh - runtime monitor of bitcoin process and memory
* btc-rpc.sh - run the bitcoind deamon with canary
* btc-gui.sh - run the bitcoin-qt gui in Xwindows
* peek.sh - peek at the debug.log to see how things are progressing
* downgrade.sh - downgrade bitcoin to 14.2 cuz of bugs
# Final config
Here is my final config, that is still syncing, but seems to be stable on 0.14.2
    /usr/bin/nice -n 15 /usr/bin/bitcoind \
                        -dbcache=145 \
                        -prune=10240 \
                        -maxmempool=5 \
                        -daemon

Looks to be about 10 bytes per TXN in redundancies.  The TXN structure I was looking at was a non-segwit TXN, so there may be more or less savings with segwit.

Bit of critique. 
If you zap TXNs make sure you spend those UTXOs, and do it as soon as possible.  Any UTXOs in signed low-fee TXNs can always be replayed when fees go down.  You want to make sure those UTXOs are spent before that happen or you will see your coins move when you don't expected (a very disconcerted feeling).  It may be unlikely that anyone would save a TXN paying them with the intent of replaying it in the far future, but never underestimate what will be done for coin.

boilerplate TXN too long msg follows
1. Try to find out what the **transaction id** is from your wallet app.
2. Pick your favorate [block explorer]( and plug [1] into it.
3. Check [ to see how long it will take.
4. Ask google if your wallet app has RBF or CPFP support.
5. If you strike out of [4] use a [transaction accelerator](
6. If [5] is too expensive, just wait and hope it eventually ages out.
If you get to [6] you should remember that that TXN could be replayed at any point, so you might want to remember to spend those coins.
For what its worth, there is a BIP to allow TXNs to be formed with expiration dates, but its still very early in the drafting phase and is to early to gauge support.

I was able to get v0.14.2 running on a GCE micro VM ($7/mo) with the following:
    /usr/bin/nice -n 15 /usr/bin/bitcoind \
                        -dbcache=150 \
                        -prune=10240 \
                        -maxmempool=5 \
                        -daemon
                    
Not a complete waste of time.  I was trying to figure out how to run bitcoin with limited memory and limited storage.
Interestingly, v0.15.1 seems to fall over about 20 minutes into the blockchain sync due to memory depletion.  v0.14.2 seems more resilient since it had some [fixes specifically]( for this type of config.  I'll open an issue against v0.15.1 though I **seriously** doubt anyone will ever try to run a config this paired down.
Correction: About 2 hours in, projected blockchain sync completion time 216 hours.  GCE gives their micro VMs a boost for the first hour, then they dialback thier CPU.  Hence the bargin.

# Reverse nLock_Time
If `lock_time` &lt;= `current_block` and `tx_in.seq` &lt; 0xffffffff for all `tx_in` then the TXN is a reverse lock.
The TXN should be confirmed as soon as economical, but ejected from the mempool after block `lock_time + n`.  Where `n` is defined as:
    n = min(n, tx_in[i].seq); // for all i
    
So a typical implementation would look as follows.  Assume the current block height is 524188, and want it ejected from the mempool after block 524288 (100 blocks)
    tx.lock_time = 1;
    ...
    tx_in[0].seq = 0x7ffff // 524288 - 1 /*tx.lock_time*/;
    ...
    tx_in[i].seq = 0x7ffff // 524288 - 1 /*tx.lock_time*/;
This should be 100% backwards compatible, since older systems seeing this as an nLockTime TXN would lock it until block 1, which happened back in 2009.  So it would effectively be just a normal TXN.
 Other implementations
If this BIP is rejected, alternate ways to foil Professor Chaos would be:
 Do it through script
A convention could be agreed upon where a constant NOP was stored in the script.  Miners would see this as a signal to eject TXNs from mempool after a specific block.
    OP_PUSHDATA1
    3
    524288 // 08 00 00 --or-- 00 00 08 -- ??? endianess ???
    OP_DROP
    OP_2DROP
Alternatively a new script OP code could be dedicated to this to make it less ambiguous.
 Do it through peer messaging
When peers send mempools to neighbors they could include the age of their TXNs as well.  This would open a new attack vector where Professor Chaos would simply say he's seem all the current TXNs a long time ago to convince miners to flush them.
 
Update... change calculation of `n` so it doesn't flush RBF TXNs

Best plan I heard of was by [Antonopoulos](  Went something like this.
1. Set aside the coins you want to bequeath in a set of UTXOs in cold storage you don't touch.
2. Collect the bitcoin addresses of those you wish bequeath your UTXOs to.
3. [Time Lock]( each beneficiary's address 90 days in the future.
4. Create a 1of2 multisig address with one of your addresses and the TimeLocked address.
5. Spend the UTXOs you wish to bequeath to the multi-sig address.
6. Every 60 days repeat the process.
As long as you regularly perform step 6, the UTXOs continually stay in your control.  If you die then you will stop performing step 6 and the timelock will eventually release the funds to the beneficiaries.  All the beneficiaries need to do is to keep up with their private keys.

Trezor or Ledger, anything else is just silly.
Reasons to pick each.
* Trezor - Because it is open source HW and open source SW.  It is far less likely that there are any hidden backdoors or NSA / 5-eyes, 9-eyes or 14-eyes portals.
* Trezor - Made in The Czech Republic which is not a member of the 5-eyes, 9-eyes, 14-eyes programs.  Ledger is made in France which is one of the 9-eyes nations that partners with the NSA on intelligence gathering.
* Ledger - Uses closed source HW which makes it harder for attackers to glen internal workings of the device and HW.
* Ledger - No party has ever claimed to have accessed secure storage before, where as Ledger [claimed]( they have penetrated the Trezor HW security with custom designed electrical equipment and delamination techniques.

Well... if they are running **unmodified** core code then the node/miner will eject a transaction from its mempool that has lingered there for more than a few weeks.  What you are running into is the following.
* NodeA receives TXNy on Nov 3.
* NodeB joins the network on Nov 15 and asks neighbors for the mempool.
* NodeA ACKs NodeB's request and sends TXNy along with its mempool.
* NodeA ejects TXNy from its mempool on Nov 17 after it lingered for two weeks.
* NodeB keeps TXNy and rebroadcasts since the TXN is only 2 days old from its point of view.
Update: Actually realized a simple low risk fix to this would be to allow an upgraded mempool sync command.  When a Node asks neighbors for TXNs, it's neighbors could send the TXNs along with some extra optional data.  The optional data would be something like this:
    [
        {
            TxID: "..." , // Hash of the TXNy.
            FirstSeen: "..." // The height of the blockchain when the TXNy was first seen.
        },
        {
            TxID: "..." , // Hash of the TXNz.
            FirstSeen: "..." // The height of the blockchain when the TXNz was first seen.
        },
        ...
    ]
Of course, now the spammer could just broadcast phoney age lists to try to get everyone to flush their mempool early.

Hopefully you already realize that the wallet only does fee calculation, it doesn't collect the fees.  If you tweek the fee setting and make it too low, it may take a few hours for your transaction to confirm.  What you want is a wallet that does a good job of calculating fees, not a wallet that just sets the fees to zero (which can be done).

Because it's not just those 3 TXNs, each of those TXN are spending unconfirmed outputs that are spending unconfirmed outputs that are spending unconfirmed outputs.

Kinda asking a fractional reserve question here.  You assume that all exchanges hold 100% of the BTC that they have outstanding in customer accounts.  I don't think this is the case for 100% of the exchanges, furthermore I don't think that 100% of the exchanges are legally prohibited from do it... hence the whole **unregulated market** stuff.

Had a similar question from a minor.  Here's my reply:
Some of these might be available to minors, or at least not care.  Read ***all*** the TOS.  Definately stay away from KYC!

* [Purse.io/earn]( (shop Amazon for BTC, must be 13yo).
* [Mmycelium Local Trader](
* [Meetup.com - Bitcoin]( or any meetup you can find.  Ask to buy BTC for cash after the meeting.
* Craigslist sell for Bitcoin
* Mining &lt;= Super crazy risky unless your a savaont, makeing a profit is hard.
* Work for crypto (mow lawns and offer 50% off if the pay with Bitcoin).
Please remember that the whole reason bitcoin is only for adults is that it is easy to steal.  If you proceed there is a 100% chance that someone ***will*** try to scam you.  Make sure you catch every scammer you encounter, or you will go broke fast.

When I did it in 2017 the instructions suggested wallet-tool, but didn't want to spend the rest of the weekend installing the JDK on my kids laptop, so I grabbed a python TK tool.  I don't remember the name of it (which is shit for you, I know), but it was on github.  I thought it a bit sketchy so I did it all offline and then imported the keys to coinomi.  Moved all the UTXOs before going back online.
BTW... in your procedure listed above you placed the decrypted wallet in $PWD not /tmp.  May be your problem there.  Try:
openssl enc -d -aes-256-cbc -md md5 -a -in bitcoin-wallet-backup-testnet-2014-11-01 &gt; bitcoin-wallet-decrypted-backup
cd bitcoinj/tools
./wallet-tool reset --wallet=${mypwd}/bitcoin-wallet-decrypted-backup
./wallet-tool sync --wallet=${mypwd}/bitcoin-wallet-decrypted-backup --debuglog
Also, the readme tells you how to determine if the decrypt was successful.  If it was, relax.  You've done the hard part.  Key here is to treat the decrypted wallet like kryptonite.  It is literally a file with all your private keys for anyone to take.  Leaving it in the tmp directory with global read is ***not*** recommended.

Hacking coinbase is hard.
Hacking **you** is super easy.


Bullsh*t.  Hacking 2FA is [easy as pi](  You may have covered the weakness that this poor slob left open, but so long as Coinbase allows password / 2FA reset, your 2FA is effectively worthless.
Plus recall that most users, for some insane reason, install the mobile app, and enable password memory on their laptop.  Any device that has an active session token cached is a prime target for any attacker.
There are literally dozens of ways to get into the most locked down coinbase account.  I'd be amazed if 1 in a 1000 have their accounts properly safeguarded.
List of things that can screw you:
1. Having a phone attached to your account
2. Having an email on Coinbase used by any other account
3. Having a userid on Coinbase used by any other account
4. Having a password / email / userid that isn't produced by RNG
4. Having an email that allows password reset
5. Installing the mobile app
6. Browsing to Coinbase outside of incognito mode
7. Browsing to Coinbase on Tor or tails
8. Having extension installed on your browser used at Coinbase
9. Picking "Keep me logged in" when logging in
10. Not logging out every time you log in
11. Not disabling API access to your account

2. Amend the Constitution so that any Congress that fails to maintain a balanced budget triggers thier resignation and a new special election.

I'd like to see basic finance taught as a required course for high school graduation.  But my rants at the PTA meetings have little effect on policy.
Its a total win-win in my book.  Even if they wipe out their entire $5000 summer savings, they've learned what mistakes to avoid.  They will never be the person to lost a $500,000 house because they put their mortgage "all-in" on bitcoin

Yes CashApp is fantastic, just pay attention to fees before you begin.  Seriously... never assume "can't be that much"
CashApp waives some of these fees, but these are the ones you need to track.
1. Deposit Fee - Wire Fee, ACH Fee, Exchange deposit fee
2. Conversion Fee - how much they charge to convert USD to BTC
3. Close Book Cost - CashApp has a closed book and their "quotes" on their free service are about 1-2% above or below market (always in their favor)
4. Dust Cost - Some exchanges won't let you deposit small amounts.  This will mean some BTC gets "trapped" on the exchange.
5. Withdrawal Fee - Cost to withdrawl
6. Miners Fee - Moving BTC from an exchange to a wallet will have a [miners fee](
For CashApp these fees are:
1. Free (I think)
2. Free
3. 1-2%
4. None
5. 1.5% if you use the "Instant" feature
6. Super low since they batch with segwit.

Here's my response on a similar thread as to which to pick, but I'm more paranoid than you are.
Reasons to pick each.
* Trezor - Because it is open source HW and open source SW.  It is far less likely that there are any hidden backdoors or NSA / 5-eyes, 9-eyes or 14-eyes portals.
* Trezor - Made in The Czech Republic which is not a member of the 5-eyes, 9-eyes, 14-eyes programs.  Ledger is made in France which is one of the 9-eyes nations that partners with the NSA on inelegance gathering.
* Ledger - Uses closed source HW which makes it harder for attackers to glen internal workings of the device and HW.
* Ledger - No party has ever claimed to have accessed secure storage before, where as Ledger [claims they have penetrated]( the Trezor HW security with custom designed electrical equipment and delamination techniques.

yeah... I'm on the 12 month free promotion from GCE right now, but beyond that GCE has an "Always Free" deal where their "f1-micro" instance has 750 hr / mo free.  That's enough to run an instance 24x7x365.  Only thing you pay for is disk and network.  It comes out to like $20 / yr to run a full node.
Compare this to a Raspberry Pi, with an initial cost (with power cord and SD card) of $50.  It's annual operation cost (in electricity) is about $7 / yr
Compare to Raspberry Pi pruned node (running on SD).
|Year|lifetime GCE cost|lifetime RPi cost|
So for the first 5 years, it's actually cheaper to run a node in GCE than on RPi.  That was pretty compelling to me.

TLDR; heat engines are inefficient between -18C and 100C; ORC could be used, but wouldn't produce much; Most savings would be by not cooling intake by running on south pole; Could make a viable heat engine in a vacuum, but maintaining vacuum wastes energy. 
Fun with Physics...

But as others have said.  There isn't a mining farm in the world big enough yet to make this worth while.  The ***combined*** mining power of bitcoin is enough to make this worth while, but it is all distributed.
A non-trivial portion of electricity used in mining is spent in cooling the inlet air to a temperature that will keep the circuits in the miner from melting.  The electricity costs of miners can be reduced significantly by running them in places like Plateau Station Antartica.  You likely wouldn't need to get that drastic, but there are few places on earth that are cold enough ***year round*** to allow a miner to run with out any adjustment to inlet ambient temperatures at all.  To run an Antartic mining farm, you would have to "jump start" the station by heating the air to "room temperature" then slowly mixing in exhaust heat and external ambient air until you reach the coldest operational threshold for the miners.  This is likely going to be much warmer than the -18c highs at Plateau Station, but with the proper insulation and venting there should be enough of an ambient cold sink to never need to cool the air, only heat it.
Once started, on the coldest days, most of the mining heat will be spent just keeping the rigs from freezing.  During the summer you will generate waste heat, and it may be possible to have a feasible ORC engine.
Another option would be running in a vacuum.  If you ran a miner in low earth orbit, you could have the waste heat trigger a phase change heat engine in water.  But getting an extension cord in LEO would be hard.
A final option might be to use some exotic element that boils near room temperature.  Bromine and Chlorine come to mind, but having a chlorine gas steam engine sounds non trivial.  So yes... In the year 2525, harvesting the mining power of the bitcoin miners maintaining the galactic economy will be a thing.  For now, its fine if you can just lower your AC costs.

If you find someone to take zero-conf, good for you!  I generally tell people the following on craigslist before they pay.
1. The payment your about to send ***must*** confirm.
2. If you send it with a low fee, your welcome to go get some coffee and come back.
3. If I get another buyer before your TXN confirms I'll send the zero-conf back to you with the highest electrum fee setting.
4. If the TXN confirms before another buyer shows up, feel free to come by and pick up your purchase.
5. I button things up around 7 pm, and the neighbor is a sheriff with teenage daughters.  Itchy trigger finger.
As long as they agree to that, they are free to set whatever TXN fee they want.  I'm patient.
As far as the ATMs go, I've only dealt with KYC ATMs.  If an ATM has my ID and video of me at the kiosk, they are pretty covered from a legal standpoint.  Zero-conf is not as big of a risk to them.  That being said, I've never actually seen a zero-conf, no-KYC, reverse-ATM, so I'm not certain how the whole process works.

First off.... Please don't.... The more complicated your method, the more likely you are to loose it.  If you encrypt your 256 bit seed with some phrase like `John 3:16` then you've reduced your security by many many orders of magnitude.  This means you will have to encrypt your 256 bit code with another 256 bit code.  OK where do you store the code for the code that encrypts to code.
See where this leads.  Do what everyone else does.  Etch it steal, encase it in lacquer and bury it in the pirate chest under the old oak tree.
If your still not convinced.  Then I recommend you use GnuPG.  It will offer the best encryption that will guarantee to work in 50 years.

Ease of use and anonymity are both inversely proportional to price.  The ***cheapest*** by far will be a US based KYC enabled Exchange using 2-3 week delayed ACH deposits funding Limit Orders left on the book until they are met by a Maker.  Then sent to cold storage with the lowest imaginable fee.  ***Cheapest*** but you give up your KYC and you'll have to wait.
***Fastest*** will be an non-KYC ATM or P2P platform.  It will cost you about 7-10% premium but could probably have in in BTC by the end of the day.
I'd start by KYC'ing Coinbase, Gemini, Kraken and CashApp.  Of the 4, one of them will likely get your KYC through in a few days.  Of the four one of them will likely screw it up taking months to sort out.  I'd just recommend you work with whichever one doesn't screw up the KYC or ACH and move on from there.
BTW, you will want to calculate the costs of various exchange quotes.  Many have blind orderbooks which can cost 3-4% above market.  [Here's an app and writeup](

@_date: 2019-07-29 18:34:34
Seems like obvious advice but so many people loose site of it.
***Pay the lowest fee possible***  
Seriously that's my advice.  If you ever work with compound interest you will know what I mean.  Imagine two people buying crypto every week for 20 years (Alice and Bob).  Bob is focused on getting "todays price" and is willing to pay the 1.50% fee for "instant buy" from his exchange.  Alice uses the cheapest way to deposit money into the exchange and uses the cheapest exchange.  This means she has to wait 2-3 weeks from when she deposits to when she buys.  Most people caught in FOMO-fever will think that Bob would win, but it isn't the case.  Alice will have many many times as much money as Bob, all based on that small 1.50% savings compounded as the opportunity cost between them.
Just open excel and run the numbers before you just assume that Bob or Alice will win.  There are different times to use either strategy.  Bob does actually win in periods of 10x growth, but the [lifetime]( APR of bitcoin from 0.000994 USD/BTC to 9500 USD/BTC is actually about 5x not 10x.  Its even 4x if you track from the opening of MtGox, and 2.3x if you track from the track from the opening of Coinbase.
Lowest fees on market right now is Coinbase Pro at 0.15% and Kraken at 0.16%

Generated from the test-vector seed `12x {'all'}`.  The library you want is `bitcoinjs-lib`.  Here's a clip of code I wrote in January 2018.  You might need to use some older versions of these libraries for it to work.  I haven't updated it.  I know there were [some malware]( inserted into the NodeJS CDN at some point, but I don't know which release.  If I recall I think Jan 2018 was clean but I noted not to update `bitcoinjs` for some reason.

var bitcoin=require('bitcoinjs-lib');
var root=bitcoin.HDNode.fromBase58(pubNode);
var child=root.derivePath('0/0');
var pubKey = child.keyPair.getPublicKeyBuffer()
// legacy address
var lgcyAddr=child.getAddress();
// p2sh segwit
var redeemScript = bitcoin.script.witnessPubKeyHash.output.encode(bitcoin.crypto.hash160(pubKey))
var scriptPubKey = bitcoin.script.scriptHash.output.encode(bitcoin.crypto.hash160(redeemScript))

TLDR; OP is right if BTC realizes 4x growth (300%) year over year.  Otherwise, putting a bit away each week builds faster.
LOL... OP I hear ya', I don't think anyone else does.  Calling everyone an idiot is a good way to ensure you will lose pretty much any argument.
For those still reading, what OP is **trying** to say is the following.  Assume you have two people Bob and Alice.  Lets call OP 'Bob' the BTC maximalist, and the "store of value" user 'Alice'.  Lets say Bob and Alice both work the same hourly factory job getting paid (net) $1000 (fiat) per week, and that both Bob and Alice spend $770 per week putting the rest in savings.
Now we will have to imagine some BTC growth here, and perhaps this is where the deserters will chime in.  For simplicity lets assume that BTC will realize a 60% growth annually.  This would translate to a 0.129% growth per day. 
 Bob
Bob has put some money aside so that he is not living paycheck to paycheck.  Since he has, he can do the following.  He has his Coinbase Pro account automatically pull a paychecks worth of USD into his CB.Pro USD wallet every week.  Once the CB.Pro USD money settles, he issues a market buy on BTC then sends it to his CashApp for easy spending with a CashCard.  Maybe's he's written a python script to hit the APIs to make it happen.  Call it magic if it makes you feel better, but his process looks something like this.
Time | Checking Account | CB.Pro USD | CB.Pro BTC | CashApp
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- | :--
Week 1 | Wk Pay | 0 | 0 | 0
Week 2 | Wk Pay | Wk Pay | 0 | 0
Week 3 | Wk Pay | Wk Pay | Wk Pay in BTC | 0
Week 4 | Wk Pay | Wk Pay | Wk Pay in BTC | Wk Pay in BTC
Week 5 | Wk Pay | Wk Pay | Wk Pay in BTC | Wk Pay in BTC
Week 6 | Wk Pay | Wk Pay | Wk Pay in BTC | Wk Pay in BTC
So there are 3 paychecks "in the chute" at any point in time, but basically he's converting his settling earnings into BTC at a cost of 0.25% ($2.50) per week.  Since he's saved up enough, he's able to leave 3 paychecks in the "chute" because CB.Pro is slow as snot when it comes to settling fiat deposits.  Faster options exist, but were being frugal right?
Now every time Bob spends money he converts that small amount into fiat in the CashApp and uses his CashCard.  This conversion costs him 1.25%.
 Alice
Now Alice thinks Bob is nuts.  He's paying a 1.25% "tax" every time he spends money because he has to convert it from BTC.  Bob argues that since his entire principle is realizing a 0.129% growth, that the growth of his principle outstrips that spending "tax" he has to realize.  Alice argues that instead of paying to convert her funds to BTC then back to fiat when she spends, that it would be better for her just to put her "extra" money into BTC once per check.  So Alice's flow looks like this:
Time | Checking Account | CB.Pro USD | CB.Pro BTC
:-- | :-- | :-- | :-- 
Week 1 | Wk Pay | 0 | 0 
Week 2 | Wk Pay | Wk "extra" Pay | 0 
Week 3 | Wk Pay | Wk "extra" Pay | Wk "extra" Pay in BTC
Week 4 | Wk Pay | Wk "extra" Pay | Wk "extra" Pay in BTC
Week 5 | Wk Pay | Wk "extra" Pay | Wk "extra" Pay in BTC
Week 6 | Wk Pay | Wk "extra" Pay | Wk "extra" Pay in BTC
So Alice actaully plugs this into Excel to try to find out.  Her results are ***"Alice Wins"***
 Conclusion
Alice shows Bob her spreadsheet, and he's convinced she's wrong.  First he argues that 60% a year is stupid and that Bitcoin is gonna "moon" this Christmas.  "OK", says Alice.  "Pick a number.  If not 60% what?  2x, 3x".  Bob declares, "Now your talking.  Yes, lets try 3x.  200% growth per year".  Alice plugs in the new numbers, but still **Alice wins**.  Intrigued, she keeps plugging in higher and higher numbers until at last, **Bob wins** at 291% growth per year.
Some may also thing that bi-weekly or monthly paychecks may make a difference.  They do.  Here's the chart for the growth rate bitcoin needs to maintain for Bob to catch Alice
Pay Frequency | Daily Growth % | Annual Growth % | Annual Growth multiple 
:-- | :--: | :--: | :--:
Weekly | 0.3745% | 291% | 3.91 x
Bi-Weekly | 0.1996% | 107% | 2.07 x
Monthly | 0.1032% | 45.7% | 1.457 x
So basically, in order to overcome that "small" 1.25% fee he has to pay on each conversion from BTC to fiat so that he can "spend BTC", Bob has to grantee a 4x growth in BTC year over year.  Certainly possible, but definitely not a "sure thing"
Source: I checked various ways to "spend bitcoin".  1.25% is the best deal in town currently.  ***Change my mind***

4) ***Don't over complicate things*** - Storing your 0.0001 BTC behind a 24 word seed, with a 37 char RNG generated passphrase on an encrypted tails partition, on a hidden drive key partition, stuffed inside your mattress, with a self destruct mechanism is overly paranoid.  Just get a HW wallet, and put your seed in a sealed envelope.  Much else and you will eventually forget all the steps you invented to hide your fortune. 
5) ***Store your secrets*** - Although you may be the memory champion of Europe, traumatic brain injury is a thing.  Spend a few bucks on a steal punch and store your secrets on a dog-tag or something.  Just store them somewhere.  This includes your PIN, seed, passphrase and laptop password.
6) ***Have an estate plan*** - You may not like your siblings or parents, but the default estate plan for when you die holding bitcoin is that they are added to the list-of-the-lost-coins.  Great for us since it adds scarcity to our holdings, but really probably not what you intend.  Easiest (and worst) option is just to put your secrets in a sealed envelope in a safety deposit box and add a note to your family saying "sorry I was a jerk... really did love you guys, here's the secrets to unlock 100 BTC... enjoy".  If you want to be all James Bond about it, set up a "Gmail delayed send" to your family every Jan 1st saying "BTW, I have safety deposit box  in the Boston downtown Chase branch".  If your alive at Christmas, reschedule it for another 13 months out.

From what I understand of LND if I loose my computer in a house fire the channel will just persist as it did when I last touched it.  Eventually (weeks down the road) the locktime and a closing transaction will happen on-chain.  At that point, so long as I have my seed words, my "lost bitcoin" are returned.
Was all of this some new LND protocol upgrade?  I had thought it kind of always worked like that?

Trick will be to avoid "KYC".  Here's a list of sites that might help.  Non-KYC sites can charge a premium to know what the real price is to compare ([here's a calculator]( use pair "btc-gbp")
* [P2P exchanges (e.g., LocalBitcoins, Bisq, HodlHodl, Paxful, etc.,)](
Also look at local meetups.  Most people there will sell you BTC at a local group after the meeting.

1. Go to `fidelity.com`
1. Find the nearest branch office.
1. Make an appointment with a financial planner.
1. Fly out to meet them
1. Sit down and tell them you possess 25 million in Bitcoin that you'd like to transfer to Fidelity for Bitcoin custodianship.
[They do that]( and would likely bend over backwards to earn your business.
Other alternatives involve taking personal ownership of the funds with a HW wallet.

Can you explain how moon works on the backend.  I'm sure that Amazon isn't dealing with LN, so how does it work.  The way I image it to be would be something like:
* On an Item and customer clicks "pay with moon"
* Moon extension uses JS kungfu to figure out customers Amazon default shipping address.
* Moon backend buys the item from amazon using their corporate Moon Amazon account.
* Moon backend edits the order and changes the shipto address to match the customers address.
* Moon frontend throws up a LN payment invoice for the customer with a countdown timer.
* If timer expires without payment Moon backend edits the order and cancels it before it is shipped.
I doubt this is correct but it raises questions in my mind.
1. Amazon must see moon clearing thousands of orders.  Do they just not care or have they blessed your venture?
2. I have about a 10% loss rate with Amazon (porch pirates, broken packages), so far Amazon has been understanding and hasn't challenged my high loss rate.  How does Moon deal with porch pirates and broken packages.
3. I have a fairly high return rate.  I usually order stuff to "see if it works".  How does Moon handle returns?  Do you refund the original amount of BTCLN, or do you repeg the return to USD?
4. I'm a prime customer so I don't pay for shipping.  Can I use my shipping discounts on Moon?
5. I get lots of amazon credits.  Can I use my amazon credits on Moon?
6. My Dad doesn't have prime.  Can he get better shipping rates using Moon?
7. My state doesn't have tax reciprocity with some states giving me some tax-free purchases.  Do I have to pay NY sales tax with Moon?
8. If Moon is installed but (for some reason) I pay with CC, did Moon just swipe my CC number?
Could someone fill in how the backend really works for me?

A thousand times this.  I gave everyone I knew 0.10 BTC paper wallets years ago when it was practically free.  I wanted to convey to them the power of the private key and how that was in essence the beginning and end of possession.  I had told them all to just keep a copy of the key somewhere safe.
When it crossed 10k the first time I started getting emails and calls from people I hadn't talked to in years.  All wanting to know how to cash in on that $1000 "giftcard" I gave them.  Of the dozen or so I gave out, only 3 of them actually kept it, and about a half dozen people wont talk to me anymore.
So yes... keep the keys.  Even if you give them a Trezor, keep the seed.  100% guarantee they will loose it then hate you for it.

Family knows... Can never pull a lie to my family, they take one look at me and know.  If they knew I had the keys, it wouldn't be a gift, more like a "wow... look at this thing of mine... want to borrow it".  By destroying the keys, I really did give it to them.  My hope was that the sincerity of the offer would provide enough of an impression for them to keep up with it.
Oh well.  Really was fine with it going away... really never expected I'd feel guilty about it.

It's easy.  Current blocksize is 1MiB, but each bock is also allowed to have some "extra" data.  The extra data cannot exceed 3MiB.  The "extra" data is the "segregated witness".  It's basically what used to be the TXN signature (sorta).
Theoretical block limit is somewhere below 4MiB, but I'd have to do math to know how far below 4MiB.  But the largest block will definately be the one with the most segwit TXNs since those blocks will have the largest "extra" part.

Trezor or Ledger.  Anything else is just silly.  Reasons to pick each.
* Trezor - Because it is open source HW and open source SW.  It is far less likely that there are any hidden backdoors or NSA / 5-eyes, 9-eyes or 14-eyes portals.
* Trezor - Made in The Czech Republic which is not a member of the 5-eyes, 9-eyes, 14-eyes programs.  Ledger is made in France which is one of the 9-eyes nations that partners with the NSA on intelligence gathering.
* Ledger - Uses closed source HW which makes it harder for attackers to glen internal workings of the device and HW.
* Ledger - No party has ever claimed to have accessed secure storage before, where as Ledger [claimed]( they have penetrated the Trezor HW security with custom designed electrical equipment and delamination techniques.

Well, since you can't get granularity beyond the penny on a USD exchange, the spread on a mBTC-USD pair would be 0.10% (minimum).  That is a pretty big spread compared to the current average spread on the BTC-USD book (about 0.03 %).  If you instead made a USD-mBTC order book, that would make a lot more sense.  You could get the spread on that order book down to 0.01 % which ain't that bad.

At 10€ / month, I'd suggest you stockpile a low fee altcoin.  Then once a year trade in your alt for bitcoin.  It will help you reduce the attrition you fear with network fees.  You'll only have 1-2 bitcoin network fees a year.
The alts won't grow as fast, but there is a lift that bitcoin gives to all altcoins.  Litecoin would likely be the best bet since it is on most exchanges and is very inexpensive.

Since you asked... I think the whole "I have more BTC than you" stuff is repulsive.  It is not how anyone should try to bring people into the fold.
If you honestly want to increase the value of BTC, try to get every person on the planet to hold some, very small piece, of a bitcoin.
With 7 Billion people and 21 Million BTC, that is enough for every person to get 3 mBTC.  Now given the fact that this can be a month's wages in some parts of the world, I think asking people to hold 3 mBTC is plenty.
I know it feels good to accumulate so much wealth, and it there is a great lesson on risk and reward in it... I just don't think the comparative games advance any cause.

my 2 satoshis...
1. Con... there may be some alt-coin rewards associated with those original addresses.  You can boost your portfolio by 5-10% by harvesting them.  It's risky because the harvesting involves handling your private keys, where keyloggers or clipboard trojans may be at play.
2. "Send To" then enter your HW wallet address.  The fee will be whatever the normal BTC is that day.  **Warning**, I wouldn't advice sending 100 BTC in one blind transaction and hoping for the best.  I'd advice sending 10 mBTC first to test how congested the network is... ensure it lands where you sent it, sleep on it... study it, then do the larger send.
3. All the HW wallet does is convert your passphrase to BTC addresses.  They are **good** because they do it in a way that is very difficult to snoop.  But the point is the "phrase-to-key" algorithm is known.  It's called BIP44.  There are hundreds of implementations.

* Trezor - Because it is open source HW and open source SW.  It is far less likely that there are any hidden backdoors or NSA / 5-eyes, 9-eyes or 14-eyes portals.
* Trezor - Made in The Czech Republic which is not a member of the 5-eyes, 9-eyes, 14-eyes programs.  Ledger is made in France which is one of the 9-eyes nations that partners with the NSA on intelligence gathering.
* Ledger - Uses closed source HW which makes it harder for attackers to glen internal workings of the device and HW.
* Ledger - No party has ever claimed to have accessed secure storage before, where as Ledger [claimed]( they have penetrated the Trezor HW security with custom designed electrical equipment and delamination techniques.

If an alien were to come to earth and we tried to explain how gold is more valuable than carbon, they would laugh.  There is no **intrinsic** value in gold.  It's not like lithium or plutonium, those have real industrial use.  Now gold does have industrial use, but that is not why it costs what it costs.  It costs what it costs because:
1. People don't trust fiat.
2. People have invested in it, and have a vested interest in it not being zero
3. Its scare
4. People think it's pretty
If it's not convincing... replace the word `gold` with `diamonds`.  Diamonds are equally as made up


Totally true.  BTC is not zombie proof.  Gold and Diamonds are much better in this regard.  
Not to joke though, your point is really well worth discussing.  BTC is a first-world coin.  Only people with access smart phones and internet can use it.  20% of the global population have no power.  30% of the globe has no smartphones.  50% of the global population has no reliable internet.  Even if everyone with power, phones and internet were to go all in on BTC, that would still leave a large unserved group of people.

Hell dude.  Bitcoin be damned, I'd move to another 1st world country if they would just give me a f**king green-card.  I find it hilarious how people imagine that its that easy to just walk into Canada and say "Hi, I'd like to live here now".  I've looked into Canada, UK, and Australia and New Zealand.  At the time the easiest country was Australia if you were a primary school teacher since they needed some "out west".
Many years later I did get an opportunity to move to Taiwan.  Had the family convinced and everything, but we had to care sick relatives stateside and by the time that was settled the offer had dried up.
If your into genealogy you used to get credit for relatives from that country.  I could get my Mother a green-card in UK, but she couldn't pass it on to her kids.  If she moved the UK and became a citizen she could sponsor me but she'd have to expatriate to do it.
But yes, if I could buy a greencard for bitcoin, I definitely would.  Problem is, only places with citizenship for sale are not the ones that are high on my list.
Current BTC top pick would be [Slovenia](  Easiest way to get a green-card is as a [Venture Capitalist](  If you invest 50,000 EUR in a startup, you get residency so long as the company stays afloat.  If you hit the 10 year mark you can apply for citizenship.
There is fast track Slovenian citizenship through marriage or if you have a parent / grandparent with Slovenian citizenship.  There is no birthright citizenship.  Children can only inherit citizenship from a parent.

Generally I found the IRS is more forgiving when you ask to pay taxes you forgot as opposed to them having to track you down.  Once they send you a letter, they are not in a negotiating mood.
There is some signalling that they are looking to get a bite of bitcoin taxes.
1. They subpoenaed a US exchange to get the KYC of customers who had more than 2 BTC in their account.
2. There is a bill before the US congress criminalizing the non-disclosure of digital currency balances.
3. The 2018 tax bill currently before congress threatens to make crypto/crypto transactions taxable at the transaction level.  This would mean convert from BTC/LTC its taxed, when you move BTC/BTC from your wallet to the exchange, its taxed.  When you move BTC/BTC from the exchange back to your wallet, its taxed.  And the burden of record keeping is on the tax payer... not the exchange.
Blockchain is awesome... but it does make it easier for state entities to realize every cup of coffee you've bought with bitcoin since 2009.

Around the same time you open payment channels ($100 each) with Coinbase, Bitpay, and a few other BTC companies.
When you go to McDonalds if you had a channel open with anyone they had a channel open with you get the TXN for a super low $0.001 fee.
At the end of the month your payment channels you opened are closed out at a cost of $10 each.
At the end of the month McDonalds channels are closed out at a cost of $10 each.
All your BTC TXNs for the entire month were done for around $30, instead of $30 per TXN.

u/NoDaleks mentioned that CashApp uses people to review KYC, so it sounds like your good to go.
Places like coinbase have automated KYC processes that rarely involve people.  Most of thier KYC requests will be from bots trying to create fraudulent accounts.  There are 200+ passport patterns and 50 US DL patterns.  With 99% of customers summiting DL, that code is run thousands of times a day, it's probably very solid.
Very few people submit passports so the code is rarely run and not as reliable.  Same could be said if your state changes the format of is DL.  It would likely break most automated KYC checks.

Two transactions that have the same mining complexity (aka size, weight) and the exact same fee would not be sorted against each other.  They will effectively be randomly selected.  I ***seriously*** doubt a miner would let their OCD put mining power to work sorting TXNs by date.
The job of a miner is to do the smallest amount of work for the largest amount of gain.  Shaving microseconds off of computation is considered a very worth-while endeavor.  No wasted effort should be used.
That being said... statistics dictate that oldest TXNs would get mined first even if they aren't sorted.  If every block is just randomly selected (like a lottery) the old transactions will participate in more lotteries so they are more likely to get mined.  Not to fall for the gamblers fallacy, but taking a broad view, generally older transactions will eventually win the lottery and get in the block.

Ohh it is known... just not known by you.  All BTC transactions are public in a chain of transactions going to the last address all the way back to the coinbase (origin).  If the owner of **any** address is known, then it becomes a graph theory (math) problem to determine all that entities relations.  
Companies like Google / Amazon / NSA Inc all spend a lot of time and money gathering all types of telemetry about users.  If amazon can predict with a 90% probability that I'll buy a Asimof book this month, then other companies can guess, with very good probability, what address on the blockchain belong to you.
Things get more interesting with the IRS forcing exchanges to hand over records.  If those records included blockchain TXINs then the IRS can figure out all your past and future transactions.
So yes... its known... just not by you (or me).

2. Some buys have hold times before you can send them.
3. Some exchanges require an alarming amount of data to verify your identity.
4. Some types of deposits have fees associated with them.
5. When buying/selling BTC on an open order book, the size of the spread is a type of fee.
6. Different types of buys/sells can have different fees.
7. When buying/selling on a closed order book, there is usually a hidden fee based on how far off spot your quote comes in.
8. Withdrawing funds can sometimes come with fees.
9. Moving funds on-chain also has a fee.

We'll just have to wait and see.  I thought up the same thing, so I see where your at.  One way you could do it (scarey) is to leave all your BTC on the exchange and put a stop-limit out for your entire balance.  What that would do is turn all your BTC into USD if the price ever dipped below a certain amount.
Sounds great... here's the downside.  Leaving BTC on an exchange exposes you to [government siezures](  Also... there may be a "flash crash" where the price dips 80% for 3 seconds then swings back up 70%.

If I wouldn't have been able to spend it, I never would have bought it.  Didn't horde it till much later.
I look at BTC as stock certificates.  You can submit the certificates to a broker and move them in and out of the market.  Each time you pay a $5/$10 commission.
I think BTC's time as a currency is done for a while.  They will likely have lightning and side chains up and running in 2019 and then it will take off again.  
I think the mania that everyone is feeling will get retailers to adopt altcoins.  Once that dam breaks cryptocurrency will hit the bigtime.  I would imagine that retailers will trade in their altcoins for bitcoin at the end of the day and that will be their "bank".  They will convert to fiat as the time arises to, but in increments of 10k.
Once lightning and side chains are in all the wallets and exchanges, alts will die and it will just be bitcoin and bitcoin derivatives (side-coins).  I'd give it another 5 years to all play out.
Or I'm stark raving mad... could always be that.

[Buying coffee]( of course.
Basically miner fees on Bitcoin are [too high](  So instead of paying $1 in fees, you can either:
1. Intentionally broadcast a low-fee TXN and wait (good option, may take an hour).
2. Batch all your future TXNs into one and pay the fee only once (or twice actually).
The "batching" is what Lightning does.  It does other stuff like give some degree of anonymity and provide instant TXNs and a few other cool features.  But most of what you see outside of here will talk about TXN (transaction) cost

There will be.  There will be as many crypto-coins as there are linux distros.  But just like OSes, only a scant few will have enough market share to make any difference.  Anyone can make a PenguinFuck linux distro, but that doesn't make it good.
Same with Crypto.  What makes it good... the ONLY thing that makes it good, is the hashing power the miners put behind it.  Now **WHY** they mine it is a questions for an Econ professor, but they do.  What will make any crypto completely worthless is if the hashing power were to drop by 99.999% for a long enough period of time to drop the difficulty by 99.999%.  Then many transactions would become forgable and and there would be no security associated with the coin.
Most small cap alt-coins have this problem... that is one of the reasons they are worthless.

Are they proposing that 10 million channels be opened for 0.5 million payments... that's what threw me.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:09:00


Perhaps my point is unclear.  If **Alice** spams the 0-10 band, then **Bob** opens his wallet to make a payment to **Carol**, his wallet will *usually* decide not to use the 0-10 band since it sees that it is filled up, so, in order to pay Carol, Bob's wallet will increase it's fee to the 20-30 band (more like 200-300 these days).  So, de-facto, **Alice** has caused **Bob**'s wallet to raise its fees to pay **Carol**


Maybe your missing the point.  Your correct that spamming the 300 band would be suicide, but spamming the 60 and 70 band would be pretty safe (for now).  By filling the 60-70 band the spammer (Alice) ensures that most wallets will try to rise above the 60-70 band, increasing the fees of the user (Bob).  The **magic** here is for the spammer (Alice) to be good with math and pick a band that is statistically unlikely to get mined.  As long as the spam isn't mined, it costs the spammer (Alice) nothing.  Unconfirmed TXNs are free.


Only if they get mined.  Unconfirmed TXNs are free.  Huge gamble, but a gamble that would be profitable, if math was done right.

Here's one worse.  I don't think they are *JUST* after the capital gains of the 14k coinbase users... I think they want to data-mine the block chain.  Once you can tie *ONE* address through KYC to a real person, you can walk the chain up and down from that address and data mine probable transactions that person has done.
Think of it as a bitcoin consumption tax.  Every time you use bitcoin that has been growing in your wallet, the IRS is going to expect you to pay 40% short term gains on whatever growth that coin has achieved.

Disclaimer: Bitcoin is speculative, as such some people have an almost religious attachment to the infallibility of the technology. This may be, in part, due to holdings that they want to safeguard. Not all opinions are unbiased (myself most of all).
May have missed the boat... kinda like Amazon.  Shipping prices are steep.  Network fees last week were as low as a few dollars, now they are $10-$20.  Any physical coin you buy to load will cost you $10-$20 to load.
You might try a different crypto who isn't so popular now, and so has lower network fees, but even then... the physical tokens your looking for are usually $20 un-loaded.
Paper wallets may be your only option at that price point.

Evil tin-foil-hat action items to exile BTC from USA
* Make it a federal crime to exchange USD for BTC.
* Declare it is illegal for a US citizen to hold a private key for a bitcoin address.
* Commission NSA to monitor US ISPs for ports related to full node operations.
* Commission NSA to monitor mempool for TXIDs originating from US IP addresses, and flag them for future US prosecution if ever tied to a US citizen.
* Run analytics on the blockchain using the information subpoenaed from the exchanges to build a list of known US addresses.  Once one address is known, all relations to that address is known... Data mining software is smarter than you may realize and doing probabilistic determinations as to who controls what address.
* Put out endless press about how evil bitcoin is and if you *known something say something*.  Terrorism is bad... bitcoin is terrorism.

[source]( since the lyrics bot seems asleep tonight.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:18:55
The latter.  So putting on my "how to kill bitcoin hat" logic goes something like this.
1. Bitcoin is property, taxed on capital gains... fine.
2. Ownership of bitcoin is possession of the private key.
3. Crypto keys are unique so like-to-like kind rules don't apply.
Here's how you can take these three rules and weave a bad web.  If you buy a bitcoin and keep it for 20 years, normal asset hold rules apply.
Now... if you ever transact with that bitcoin heres what happens:
* Your wallet generates a key for a new change address.
* You use the private keys for the unspent address to sign a transaction for the address your sending to, and your change address.
* You send the TXN to the mempool and it is mined into a block.
Since ownership is holding of a private key, the transaction cashed the entire unspent output into a new address.  So... if you had 20 BTC that you bought for $20 in 2009 in an old address, and you used your HW wallet to buy a plane ticket for 0.1 BTC, you would spend your 20 BTC, and deposit 19.9 into your change address.  So, when that TXN was mined you just realized a $200,000 capital gains in the cashing of the old address and sending to the new address.  Your 0.1 BTC plane ticket just came with a $50,000 tax burden.
I like to think that there is no way on God's green earth that the US treasury could ever be that stupid.... but some days I'm not so sure.

Not to shil... I have my serious concerns, but as best I can describe it is this...
1. Right now BTC is like holding bullion.  I've dabbled in gold bullion, and if you have $100 worth of gold, it's gonna cost you a pretty penny to turn it into USD, and what's more, you have to drive to the bullion shop and haggle to do it.  If lots of people are moving bullion to USD, the bite the shop operator takes is bigger.  So right now BTC is bullion.
2. At some **future date** BTC will be less like bullion and more **exchangeable**.  I will refrain from from naming the date, or how exchangeable it will become.  But both will move it in the right direction.
[1] is governed by the manic demand right now.  At some time in the future, the demand will level off.
[2] is governed by the fact that engineering is hard, and engineering done right is **very** hard.  There are good people coming up with good answers, but I won't speak to how or when because that is shilling, and will go off the rails quick.

It's better to think of the fee amortized over the life of the channel, but yes... super low fees for the coffee shop.
Of course not everything would be a good candidate for a channel.  If you had 5 BTC on a paper wallet in cold storage and you wanted to convert it to fiat for Christmas, there really wouldn't be a channel you would use for that.  So that TXN would likely be whatever the Segwit fee was at the time.

I think the miners are likely the most educated group...  Don't follow your point.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:16:49
Longer answer.


Exactly correct.  Free market is working perfectly.  The remittance market is a good example of this.  The price of remittance TXNs (Western Union) take into account the risk Western Union takes, and the cost of the infrastructure.  But the pricing is far above these factors.  In the end remittance is priced at the very edge of the customers pain threshold.  It cost $10 because they found too few people would bay $20.  And if too few people pay $10, they could drop it to $5 and still be plenty profitable.  This is why TXN pricing in BTC is (and will) trend towards WU pricing under current market conditions.


None of those future expansions change the market dynamics, only the pressure on various aspects of it.  Once LN rolls out, there will be less pressure on TXN, so spamming would naturally increase until LN TXNs cost $10.  As you pointed out before.  Market pressure will always raise TXN cost to the highest pain threshold of the users.

As of Dec 13 @ 6:00 pm UTC, segwit = $10 for 250 byte normal TXN

Now keep in mind those are the cheapest 10 TXN in the last 6 blocks... so your luck will vary.
Did confirm that CPFP is the reason that low fee TXNs are found in these blocks.  They are almost always TXNs being fished out by users through accelorators or CPFP wallets.

If Coinbase commits big in lightning by committing some deep percent of their hot wallet to payment channels, fees will go down... **WAY** down.  Otherwise it's a wait and see thing till all the buzz wheres off and traffic dies down.

You can't use your MC/Visa on Coinbase, but you could use another exchange or something like [Changelly.com](  But one Changelly user [complained]( that fees were in excess of 30%.  I'd say buy $10 of LTC on Changelly and see how badly you get ripped off.  That should only cost you $3 to find out.

People are not supposed to work get a job out of college that will buy then 10 hamburgers and hour, then work for 30 years and have their final year's salary net them 10 hamburgers an hour.  It causes discontent.
Most of the millennials (majority of BTC holders) have parents / grandparents who went from 2 hamburger / hr to 10 hamburgers and hour over the course of their career.  That just hasn't been the case for a few groups of the population.  
Perhaps people should not expect the salary growth that the US has historically seen.  Perhaps they should be contient so long as they keep a little bit above inflation.  But it doesn't seem to be the case.

Obvious and short answer is no.  What you need are raw transactions, and I don't think Trezor or Mycelium support those... but check the manual and menu selections.
Long answer, the word "possible" is rather open ended.  If you decide to completely circumvent 100% of the security that a HW wallet provides, then sure.  There are websites that will dump your BIP44 derivations from your Trezor pass phrase and give you all your keys.  Once you have the key in question you could import the key to another wallet and since that is the only address, that would be the only spend.  You could also import it into bitcoin core and craft raw transactions there, but that is overkill.... well it's all overkill...

Harmful... The institutional investors are too closely tied to DC / K-Street.  Traditional buy/hold investing, the investors try to **increase** the value of the asset / class.  Futures investors can play either side so they can bet on **decreases** in value.  I think the easiest play is for them to bet on a decrease in value (short) then trigger new sweeping legislation to panic the market and drop the price.
DC / K-Street have done similar things to the Gold market when the price was going exponential.

Agreed on most points.  Only place we differ on is probability.  A spammer would, as you pointed out, have to commit to at least 3 days in the mempool.  If mempool ever clears (as it did in late Oct) then the spammers risk loosing it all.  But, as I said, we differ on the probability.  I content that doing a 3 day spam run in the 30-40 range would still be unlikely to have a high confirmation rate, and would significantly raise fees.
Without a full statistical workup, I can't confirm my point, so it's just an opinion, but I think that is the only spot we diverge.

I suspect they are running Neutrino scans and closing accounts based upon the results.  They pulled my thread down.
 Are you guys closing accounts because of Neutrino scans?
* [Original Thread](
* [Thread deleted by Coinbase Mods](
* [Archive.is](
* [Archive on my subreddit](
Dear Coinbase,
   I'm bored so I jumped on here to see at least 5 account closure threads in the last few days.  I realize you recently bought [Neutrino]( to analyse transactions coming into and out of Coinbase.  My question is... do you guys think that maybe you put the hop-count a little too high.  Sure if I buy pot on the first hop in or out of the exchange, I can see how your license might be at risk, but it's sounding like these users are either lying (certainly possible) or just not aware what your policy is for what transactions on an analysis will cause an account closure.
Can you please clarify:
* What transactions will blacklist a user (pot, guns, international VPN purchase)?
* How many hops into or out of your exchange must be "prestine" to keep my account open?
* If I use a mixer, would you welcome the "reasonable deniability" or simply flag that as suspicious?
Here's a recent answer I gave to one of your disgruntled customers.
Definitely weird.  I know CB recently bought a block analysis company.  If I was a betting man, I'd say that they kicked off a block analysis thread and set the parameters a bit too broad.
Problem with block analysis is that it is indiscriminate.  Here's a totally made up example:
1. You withdrawl 0.10 BTC from coinbase.
2. You use 0.05 BTC to load up a tipbot or something.
3. You tip someone on patreon, or twitter, or reddit 0.01 BTC
4. The person you tipped goes to a Colorado pot dispensary and uses your tip to buy a joint (legal in Colorado).
5. Coinbase sees that the bitcoin you withdrew hit a pot shop within 5 hops of withdrawal.  
Since BitLicense and other backwards laws hold Coinbase responsible if fiat is laundered into pot, they close your account for violation of TOS (assuming incorrectly that you were the one who bought pot).
Like I said, call your congressman and bitch about how ridiculous federal money laundering laws are.
To others who's tinfoil hat is thicker than mine, start mixing all coins going into or out of coinbase.
@_date: 2016-03-02 19:31:04
I hate to be the broken record here, but if you are sending transactions to the mempool with miserly fees, your going to have to wait.  I hate the fact, but understand that a quarter will get me to the front of the line.  I generally put a flat fee of 0.0005 BTC on any transaction I do now days.  Until the capacity issue is addressed, BTC will be a pay-to-play protocol.  Most wallets support fee-setting settings, and if they don't you might want to seriously rethink about your choice in SW.

Probably aren't because of rolling blackouts and spotty internet infrastructure I imagine the ability to stay online would be spotty at best.  Plus there is not a major exchange operating in Venezuela (that I know of) so most BTC is bought by ATM at the border, or something like that.


Yeah, that was a [41,248 sat]( TXN fee.  That is way above market rate.  I did a transaction this week for 400 sat, so you paid 100x more than I did to do the same thing.


I (and most others) recommend r/Electrum.  I set the fee to "low" but not "insane" and it suggested 400 sat.  The TXN went through within the hour.  If you do transactions frequently, like sending money every week, look at the Eclair wallet and use LN.  You should be able to do your first TXN (channel-open) for &lt; R1, and all subsequent TXN will cost less than 0.002 Rand.
Keep in mind LN and BTC-LN wallets should be considered and advanced subject and you should definitely RTFM before you dive in.

Any fee you pay for DCA is too high.  I grantee buying BTC once per paycheck at a fee of 0.50% will build more wealth than buying it every day at a fee of 3.8%.  There are very *very* few periods in pricing history where this is not the case.  Even if the fee is only 1% it is very difficult to overtake that fee just because of DCA.

The whole lecture is worth a watch.  It discussed the challenges and research going into the need to bring the next 2 billion people into the digital age with mobile phones and cellular data plans.  The question has obvious parallels with how bitcoin will get better penetration into more rural and under served communities.
The lectures premise (not surprisingly) is that central authorities won't get us there.  The key is grass-roots decentralized solutions.
 Too Long Didn't Watch
In the larger villages in some of the more impoverished areas of Uganda the study detailed how people have spontaneously created a SIM card based economy.   These villages will generally have a phone kiosk.  The kiosk operator has a cell that they will allow users to make calls on with some per-minute based fee.  
Beyond providing calling services, the kiosk will offer remittance.  If someone wants to send money to someone in the village they buy a pre-paid SIM and call the kiosk operator.  They then tell the kiosk operator who will receive the money and once they agree on fees the sender will relay the SIM redeem code to the kiosk.  
Once the SIM code checks out, the kiosk operator will give some portion of the SIM cards value to the recipient in cash.  Now the kiosk has a refill code the operator will use when their phone is running low on minutes.
This can serve as an interesting allegory to how Bitcoin micro-banking could be distributed in a similar manner.  Obviously the central authority of the kiosk operator and their ability to defraud the recipient or gouge the market with unreasonable fees are all problems.  But leaving these aside it illustrates how distributed independent economies can evolve.

I'm in the US which is an insanely regulated space.  I'd be amazed to see more ATM companies try to tackle bitlicense and the other minefield of draconian regulations in place for anyone or thing that converts fiat to BTC.  Once you hobble an ATM with all the sticky KYC requirements, its simpler to just open up a coinbase account.  Besides a KYC-ATM is useless as far as I'm concerned.  It's neither fast or convenient.  If anything I'd expect the number of US non-KYC ATMs to drop significantly over the next 2 years as states see them as easy targets for seizure.
I think the future will be P2P and DEX.  Stuff that regulators can't shutdown.

It is widely speculated that the changes made to the starlink permit applications indicate that it will be used to lease low latency trans-atlantic bandwidth instead of global internet.  If they wanted global internet they would have kept with the original plan of a higher LEO which would have provided almost complete terrestrial coverage.  They lowered the satellites orbit by half, which has interesting ramifications for competing with current trans-atlantic fiber.
Now... the satellites ***not*** currently needed for a particular data lease may indeed be used for global internet, but it will be much much more limited than originally envisioned.

Well when the greek economy collapsed there was a huge influx into crypto as those in Greece and the rest of the EU thought the the euro would suffer.  So I guess the theory goes something like this.
1. When a country collapses, its currency usually collapes.
2. While a fiat currency collapses, most holding it try to convert it to a safe (non inflationary) asset.

* Mining &lt;= Super crazy risky unless your a savaont, makeing a profit is hard.
* Work for crypto (mow lawns and offer 50% off if they pay with Bitcoin).

Security discussion (not bitcoin).
Your thoughts on the difference between [TOTP]( (google authenticator) and [U2F](  I've tried to advocate U2F over TOTP since TOTP is phishable, where U2F is not.  People just seem to react like I'm Don Quixote charging windmills.  Perhaps people don't want to hear that their 2FA is vulnerable, or they just are not compelled by my assertions.
As a thought experiment that hopefully may be more compelling.  Imagine you have two exchange accounts, one with Google Authenticator (TOTP) 2FA, and the other with a U2F-fob (Yubikey).  Further imagine that you have a spouse / parent or child you can trust ultimately.  Now, you are traveling on business and are in some location without internet when you decide you need to move some BTC.  Perhaps you had a vision or prophecy, reason doesn't matter.  
So to execute the trades you phone your family member and give them over the phone your userid, password, and answer the TOTP challenge by relaying the code to them when the time comes.  Now you try to do the same on the U2F site but realize that there is no way to relay the U2F challenge to your family member like you did the TOTP code.
So, do you think that U2F is more secure since it cannot be relayed remotely as TOTP can?
I'm still perplexed why many people stick with TOTP where U2F is available.

Main problem most people have is not picking the right HW wallet but learning how not to get scammed.  Many Ledger and Trezor users have been scammed and phished because they could not tell the difference between a bad place for seeds and a good place for seeds.
Both techs are sound, but both techs allow the user to do really bad things with seeds that simply can not be controlled.
1. A pre-printed piece of paper in the box instructing you what seed to use is ***a bad place*** for a seed.
2. A textbox on some website / app asking for your seed to initialize your device is ***a bad place*** for a seed.
3. A file on your computer called `seed.txt` with your clear text seed in it is ***a bad place*** for a seed.
There are others, but most fall for a variation of these three.

By the last accounts I saw, the Electrum team announced that &gt;90% of the unique IPs that downloaded Electrum didn't download the signatures to verify that the download was valid.  So yeah, 90% of the people would think just downloading it is fine.  But your asking the wrong person.  My paranoia level is dialed way up and I'm probably considered well into the tin-foil hat zone my most accounts.  My ***minimum*** for installing Electrum is generally:
1. Go to `electrum.org`
2. Inspect the SSL cert of `electrum.org`
3. Ensure the SSL cert matches an entry at a CRL like `crt.sh`
4. Download electrum binary
5. Download binary signature
6. Download signature signing key
7. Compare signing key to those published on the github repo
8. Inspect WoT of the signing-key to verify that it is signed by a BTC-core developer
9. Ensure that the electrum binary is properly signed by the signing-key
10. Ensure that the publish cert (if available) on the electrum binary is valid
11. Proceed with upgrade

The the story was simply a mental exercise meant to make the reader look at the security from another point of view.  If your security model ***can*** ever and in any way be relayed, or worse yet replayed, then it is vulnerable.
To give another story... imagine that the person you were talking to on the phone sounded like your spouse was really a T-9000 from the future all liquid metal molded into the voice of your loved one.  The Skynet would get your bitcoins.
Any token that can be relayed or replayed can be stolen on the wire by a hacker.  These are typically refered to as phishing or MiTM (man in the middle).  Good and proper 2FA should be something that can't be phished or MiTM'd.


The same way HW wallets prevent the handshaking from being relayed.  The client has a public key and the host (HW-wallet) has a private key.  The client gives data to the host and the host signs it with their private key and gives it back to the client.  The client can verify this signature with the public key.
U2F uses this approach of PKPK.  The U2F-fob is single function and can only tell its public key and sign blobs with its private key.  Only thing that can make the right signature is that little U2F fob, and the fob will only make that signature when connected to the same browser your logging into.  Basically it ensures that the user and the fob are both present and challenged during the authorization (login).

Yes.  If you restore with the ***exact*** seed words, passphrase and derivation path. If the passphrase, seed words or derivation path are off by any character or out of order in any way you may recover a ***different*** wallet.  They must match ***exactly***.
You should ensure you have performed a successful key backup and do a ***dry-run recovery*** to ensure you know your seed, passphrase and derivation path.  You should also consider using the labeling feature to validate your passphrase and derivation path.  Dry-run only verifies your seed.

The value is not in the space, but in the distribution.  The fact that the space in the block-chain is distributed to thousands of nodes and validated by pettahashes of computing power is what gives it value.
space * distribution
If the (distribution) number of nodes and miners start to go to zero (like FTC) its value will approach zero.  If you have no space in the block chain, you have no bitcoin.   The two complement each other.
And yes... in the beginning there were only a few dozen nodes/miners, and it was worth nothing.  If the node/miner count ever goes down to a few dozen it will be worthless again.

But it will approach 21 million once QC can break `secp256k1` and PQ addresses are introduced.  Once that happens many of the lost or forgotten UTXOs will be QC mined.  The oldest ones are stored in P2PK not in P2PKH so they will be the first to go. There will also be P2PKH UTXOs that will have known public keys due to message signing and address reuse.  They will be the next to go.
I fully expect all this to transpire before the last coinbase is granted in 2140.  The only thing left will be lost or forgotten P2PKH UTXOs with unknown public keys.  That is a much smaller set than most people bandy around.  Perhaps Grover's Alg can pick away at those, but even then I wouldn't expect a QC design to break SHA256 in the next 200 years.

My spouse and kids know where a sealed note is.  Inside the note is instructions on how to query my crypto balance via `xpub` and where to find my seed.  The instructions are simple, but in such a way that only my benefactors could realistically execute them.
My will names a specific member of my family as the cryptography executor to my estate.  This executor will be in charge of decryption of my personal files for my family as well as disposing of the cryptocurrency according to their wishes.
The executor does not know my seed and will only be given the seed once my benefactors have verified the balance in the wallet.  If BTC moons and the amount becomes more than the executor can be trusted with, my benefactors will need to think of a way to add legal teeth to the probation of my estate.

Well, as u/Moideha, its quite possible that no one really cares what you do, so the need may never arise.  But what if your Ed Snowden and the NSA has somehow determined your `xpubs` so can blacklist all your addresses.  They could roll out a targeted on Electrum servers and bitcoin nodes with mad NSA hacker skills to inject something to try to veto TXNs from the Snowden addresses.
If Snowden is running his own node, he can use his superior OPSEC to ensure his nodes are pristine.  Furthermore, with a bit of work he could determine what nodes where rejecting his TXNs and which weren't.  Then he could ensure that his node only connected to pristine nodes.
Your not Snowden, so perhaps you'll never be targeted with that type of voodoo hack.  But with the increasing encroachment of Google, Apple, Microsoft and other companies, I can see a future where data-mines pair `xpubs` to people in the same way they pair phone numbers to them today.

* seed mnemonic: a list of words (multiple of 3) used to encode a random number of either 128, 160, 192, 224, or 256 bits in width used for PBKDF2 enthropy.
* BIP39 passphrase: A string combined in SW / FW with the string `mnemonic` to salt a PBKDF2 key generation function.
* Wallet password: A string used by Electrum to AES encrypt your wallet file on disk.
You ***could*** choose to use the same string for all of them, but each of the three strings serve a different function.
There is no such thing as a 25th word.  It's just a lazy definition of BIP39 passphrase.

Unpopular Opinion:
Spending 3.6% on an automated DCA solution will almost never be more profitable than simply buying as much as you can on every payday through a cheap exchange with dog slow (free) ACH processing.
Stop paying 1.75% on CashApp, or 3.6% on Coinbase auto-buys, or even 1.5% on Gemini auto-buys.  Instead spend 30 minutes on Saturday after payday to do your ACH to the exchange.  Next payday do the same, and if the previous ACH has funded, buy some BTC with it at the lowest possible maker fee you can find.
The money you save on wire fees, blind-books spreads, and exchange fees will almost always be more than you could have yielded through some DCA scheme.

Locking up a loaded HW-wallet may not be the best choice.  I advise:
1. Secure your seed and passphrase
2. Load your `xpubs` in Electrum or sentinel to monitor your coins
3. Load a dummy seed on your HW wallet (12xAll).
4. Keep your computer and HW-wallet up to date with updates as they release.
5. If you ever need to sell, load your real seed on your up to date HW wallet
This way you are assured your funds are safe by watching the xpub, and you know your HW wallet is up to date and functional
One warning... If anyone gets your xpub, they will know your real balance, alerting a future thief that your dummy wallet is a dummy.
BTW, to secure your seed look at something like a 3of4 SSS.  Then you can keep the parts in 4 different safety deposit box (or whatever)

Slightly more secure yes.

@_date: 2019-11-14 22:30:49
Simple answer... Yes.
Nuanced answer... Kinda.  The "reuse" happens on the spend, not on the receive.  If you sent 104 payments to the same address, then that address would hold 104 UTXOs.  Whenever you spent any coins from those 104 payments you would spend one (or many) of those 104 UTXOs.  The spending TXN lists the public keys of the address your spending.
Since all 104 UTXOs are the same address, they have the same public keys.  So if you spent 4 of your 104 UTXOs, the other 100 UTXOs would have their public keys known, eroding their security ever so slightly.

Bit of advice....
Main problem most people have is not picking the right HW wallet but learning how not to get scammed.  Many Ledger and Trezor users have been scammed and phished because they could not tell the difference between a bad place for seeds and a good place for seeds.
Both techs are sound, but both techs allow the user to do really bad things with seeds that simply can not be controlled.
1. A pre-printed piece of paper in the box instructing you what seed to use is ***a bad place*** for a seed.
2. A textbox on some website / app asking for your seed to initialize your device is ***a bad place*** for a seed.
3. A file on your computer called `seed.txt` with your clear text seed in it is ***a bad place*** for a seed.
There are others, but most fall for a variation of these three.

Well most people that want cold wallets either trust a HW maker or use an open source HW wallet that they can review the electronic schematics to ensuring that there is no funny business at play.


Yeah, if you don't trust a HW wallet, you likely won't trust a SW to generate a BTC address for you.  At this point you have to make a private key using dice or cards then convert it to an address doing a ECDSA, SHA256 and RIPE160 cryptographic functions without SW, kinda impossible.
I really think the only way you are going to get a cold wallet is to either learn some serious programming and cryptography to make your own, or trust an existing open-source, widely reviewed HW / SW codebase.  Which basically means r/Trezor.

Your absolutely correct that there are ways to circumvent Neutrino, and ways to return tainted coins to curculation, but it is cavalier to simply assume bouncing them through an off the shelf wallet will help in any way to wash them.

As u/parakite and u/Rudivb point out, Electrum isn't BIP39, its BIP32.  But to the broader question of why do some BIP39 wallets use 9, 12, or 18 words (Jaxx, Coinomi, Trezor-T) while other BIP39 wallets (Trezor-One) use 24?
Best answer I've seen has to do with key loggers.  When you ask to restore a seed to some HW wallets, they used to ask for the words out of order, but still request you enter them on your keyboard.
If your given a 24 word seed that is out of order, it will take you `24!` (24 factorial ~ 2^79 ) attempts to test all the possible orderings.  2^79 is one of those "more than the grains of sand in California" type numbers.  Way to big for current computers to crack.
By comparison, if you were given a 12 word seed out of order, it would only take `12!` (479,001,600) attempts, which could be done in a few seconds on a cell phone.

I'd advise against it.  The HW wallet doesn't go in the safe... the seed, passphrase and derivation path are what you put in the safe.  The HW wallet is just a safe way to handle the seed, passphrase and derivation path safely.  You should find a reliable way to store the seed, passphrase and derivation path, such as stamped metal and Shamir's Shared Secret.  Once those are secure, simply load a dummy seed ( `all all all all all all all all all all all all` ) on your Trezor and carry it with you.  Update its FW every few months as well as keeping your laptop or other devices it interfaces with up to date.
Locking a Trezor in a safe for 50 years would be as logical as locking puch-cards in a safe for 50 years.  Your going to find it very difficult to use as the world moves 50 years into the future.  Best to keep it up to date, year by year.

Your a grown adult so your smart enough to figure this stuff out.  All you need are the time and resources.  Let me help you out.  If it makes it easier think of Bitcoin as a stock share until you get to a spot where you can understand it better.  Now assuming that you didn't have a finance or economics course in high school stocks might not make sense either.  So let me help your out.
1. r/DaveRamsey - Basic finance, balance your checkbook, debt is bad, always pay with cash... basic stuff.
2. [Fidelity Youtube]( - Flashy videos about what stocks, bonds, futures, options, ETFs and stuff are.  Look at the "beginner" stuff.
3. [Investopedia]( - More detailed articles about what stocks, bonds, futures, options, ETFs and stuff are.
4. [Mastering Bitcoin Book]( - This will tell you "What is Bitcoin" in a way that will make you smarter than 90% on the people on reddit.
5. [Python Tutorial]( - Anyone who has had HS Algebra knows enough to program python.  Knowing the smallest bit will help you greatly in the bitcoin space.
Once you get through those just read or watch anything by "Andreas M. Antonopoulos".  He's got the best ability to explain it in a way most people understand.

Bit of advice.... Your three things needed to access your funds are your seed, passphrase and derivation path.  The first two are secret.  
So... lockup your secrets, but keep your Ledger or Trezor handy to make sure it still operates from week to week.  If you were serious about locking it up for many years, you may get a rude surprise when you go to use in in 2040 only to find that bit-rot has set in and a key sector on your nand is corrupted and the device unusable.
If your insanely paranoid you can even load a disposable seed on your Ledger or Trezor when it's out of the "bomb shelter".  Just in case anyone steals your HW-Wallet and invents some new way to exfiltrate the keys from it.
As far as why an encrypted USB stick is silly.  Well USB fails, and most people think of weak passwords.  Plus if your key is raw under a single layer of encryption, it could easily be stolen once you unlock the USB and expose the data to your operating system.

3. U2F/FIDO2 based 2FA instead of weaker TOTP (google auth) or SMS
4. Different emails for stuff like banking and stuff like reddit.

TLDR; Bad governments can shutdown internet access preventing bitcoin access.
There used to be a bitcoin SMS proxy years ago.  You could send via SMS the TXN hex of any bitcoin TXN and it would broadcast it to the network.  This meant that anyone with SMS access could still get TXNs to the network.
I haven't found anyone for the last few years building up the SMS proxy capabilities due to the obvious limitation of centralization, but I still kinda like the idea if it could be worked on a bit.

Your problem isn't storing the seed... its recovering the seed.  Any time a private key is given to an operating system you are at risk until the funds that key is releasing are confirmed in a block.  You may have mad ninja skill OPSEC, but I always assume that no computer or OS (even you tails) is secure.  Maybe it's secure enough for a $100 UTXO, or a $1000 UTXO.  But what happens in 50 years when those UTXOs are worth millions.
When you use tails, you basically say "I trust the guys that developed this not to steal my keys" or at least "I trust random strangers to read all their code and validate it".  Problem is that tails is literally millions of lines of code.  Something like coldcard and trezor are 100x or 1000x smaller codebase.  Less code to attack, less code to review.  Higher confidence.
In my opinion... The two things a HW wallet does better than anything else are:
1. Generating a seed in a way that is disguised from the operating system.
2. Using a key to sign a TXN in a way that is disguised from the operating system.
For the years that your HOLDring , I think it matters not whether that thing in your safety depoist box is a laminated paper wallet or a laminated seed, passphrase, derivation-path.

Doesn't help since it is relayable (it can be relayed to a third party).
As a thought experiment that hopefully may be more compelling.  Imagine you have two exchange accounts, one with Google Authenticator ([TOTP]( 2FA, and the other with the Jamie-method.  Further imagine that you have a spouse / parent or child you can trust ultimately.  Now, you are traveling on business and are in some location without internet when you decide you need to move some BTC.  Perhaps you had a vision or prophecy, reason doesn't matter.  
So to execute the trades you phone your family member and give them over the phone your userid, password, and answer the TOTP challenge by relaying the code to them when the time comes.  Now you try to do the same on the jamie-method site, and again you can simply relay your userid, password, and second password.  So this offers similar properties to TOTP.
There are 2FA methods that cannot be phished or relayed to a third party, but this isn't it.

Even if UTXOs are known to be exposed to QC mining, they should be left alone.  Eventually Satoshi's coins will get mined and this will flood the market and cause temporary price volatility, but the protocol is about integrity, not price.

Blocks are mostly cryptographic data which is fairly uncompressible.  Best you would likely get would be something like 20% compression on a block.
Compressing TXNs would mean that miners would have to compress/uncompress to do the hashing (mining) on each and every nonce.  ASICs are custom designed to do hashing, not compression.  Miners would never agree to this.
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:16:26
Your confusing what the protocol ***is*** and who ***defines*** the protocol.
The protocol is today, and was yesterday, by definition ***decentralized***.  That definition means that there is no single or finite group of sites that MIB could go and raid to turn bitcoin off.  This is not the case for paypal.  MIB could raid the paypal datacenter, and shutdown their power station and all paypal payments would cease.
Now your correct that there are maybe 100 people on the globe that are responsible for 90% of the code that runs the consensus for the upcoming (yet to be released) version of bitcoin-qt.  So what would happen if MIB went out in a midnight raid and arrested those 100 people?  Nothing.  All the existing v0.18.1 nodes would still operate and blocks would continue to be mined.
There would not be a v0.19.1 for a while since all the key devs where in jail, but eventually new leaders in the industry would arise and take over development.

My spouse and kids know where a sealed note is.  Inside the note is instructions on how to query my crypto balance via `xpub` and where to find my seed.  The instructions are simple, but in such a way that only my benefactors could realistically execute them.
My will names a specific member of my family as the cryptography executor to my estate.  This executor will be in charge of decryption of my personal files for my family as well as disposing of the cryptocurrency according to their wishes.
The executor does not know my seed and will only be given the seed once my benefactors have verified the balance in the wallet.  If BTC moons and the amount becomes more than the executor can be trusted with, my benefactors will need to think of a way to add legal teeth to the probation of my estate.

Simply pay $25 for the $20 in bitcoin.  It's asked fairly regularly (usually by minors) so here's a caned response on how to get BTC without KYC
Some of these might be available to minors, or at least not care.  Read ***all*** the TOS.  Definitely stay away from KYC!
* [P2P exchanges (e.g., LocalBitcoins, Bisq, HodlHodl, Paxful, etc.,)](
* [Purse.io/earn]( (shop Amazon for BTC, must be 13yo).
* [Mycelium Local Trader](
* [Meetup.com - Bitcoin]( or any meetup you can find.  Ask (discretely) to buy BTC for cash after the meeting.
* Buy altcoin then [convert to Bitcoin](  Different coins have different P2P buy options.
* Craigslist sell for Bitcoin (double the price and offer 50% off if paid with Bitcoin)
* Mining &lt;= Super crazy risky unless your a savaont, makeing a profit is hard.
* Work for crypto (mow lawns and offer 50% off if they pay with Bitcoin).
Please remember that the whole reason bitcoin is only for adults is that it is easy to steal.  If you proceed there is a 100% chance that someone ***will*** try to scam you.  Make sure you catch every scammer you encounter, or you will go broke fast.

Yes.... 
1. If 51% (more would be better) of the mining hashing power lands in authoritarian countries
2. If the authoritarian country's controlling the hashing collude to ban on address.
3. If the authoritarian countries commit to raiding by force, the hashing farms, or commit massive bribes to the miners
4. If the person to be blacklisted held all the funds in knows addresses.
For example... 
* Imagine if the US, EU, AUS, and CAN decided that Jillian Assange was a terrorist hacker.
* They decide that WikiLeaks must be stopped
* Through enhanced interrogations they aquire the multisig addresses containing the bulk of thier funds
* They time a raid of the top 30 hashing farms in thier jurisdiction
* They manage to secure all facilities before the admins can destroy the ASICs.
If all that happened and the colluding govt ended up with 51% (more would be better) they could prevent those addresses from ever spending.  So long as they could maintain the longest chain and not violate block timestamp concencous rules.
A possible response would be for the other miners to start to refuse blocks found by those stolen pools resulting in a hard fork.  Now you have Bitcoin and Govtcoin.
Only way it would succeed is if no one knew it was happening, or the target of the censoring was so despised by the universe that all involved agreed to set aside thier principles.
All told, an extremely unlikely scenario.  May be a good reason for paranoid mining farms to install a kill switch on thier ASICs.

I recommend it to most Trezor users.  You will generally get more answers to questions you have that are formed "How do I ___ with Electrum" than "How do I ____ on `trezor.io`".  Plus Electrum is generally faster with feature roll out than `trezor.io`.  Bech32 and Lightning are the most obvious examples.


As long as they don't use native-segwit.  But part of the motivation is related to the previous answer.


I think python is infinitely simpler than most people think it is.  Most peoples fear of programming is really a fear of the unknown.  The python tutorial is gear to people who have literally no programming knowledge.  It's really no harder than middle school algebra.  The more advanced subjects are... well... advanced, but I think most people would be able to read a "Hello World" program and speak with a fair degree of confidence as to what it was doing.
Besides... being on this forum long enough, you invariably get the question of "Electrum failed with the message `python.exe not found`.  Can someone tell me what that means?".  Spending just a little bit of time at the console can help most people help themselves.
Also... most of the mastering bitcoin examples are in python, as is all the Trezor and Electrum source code.

No you can not.  At least not in a way that is safe or should be relied upon.
Problem is that any payment you received in your offline shop can't be put onto the network.  That means that the person who paid for that stuff could "double-spend" the bitcoin in another shop.  First shop to put the transaction on the network will get the bitcoin.
So... no... don't accept bitcoin offline please.

I know you already know this, but there are multiple "magic strings" to keep track of:
* seed mnemonic: a list of words (multiple of 3) used to encode a random number of either 128, 160, 192, 224, or 256 bits in width used for PBKDF2 enthropy.  Electrum seeds don't default to BIP39 but I think they are still 12 words.
* BIP39 passphrase: A string combined in SW / FW with the string `mnemonic` to salt a PBKDF2 key generation function.  Electrum doesn't default to BIP39, but I still think that you can augment the mnemonic with a 100 character string (passphrase)
* Wallet password: A string used by Electrum to AES encrypt your wallet file on disk.
All three "magic strings" can (and likely should) be a string of multiple words.

Generally true, for cash in hand bitcoin buy meetups, but there are some users that use web browsers to use sites like localbitcoins or exchanges to buy bitcoin.  Not ideal, but it does happen.
There are also a few misguided users that may browse reddit or what have you, on the same machine that they are running `bitcoin-qt`.  This chrome vulnerability gives the attacker access to memory, offering an attack vector to read the bitcoin-qt config or inject data during transaction formation and signing.
All good motives to ensure you run your full-node on an isolated machine without things like desktops environments or web browsers installed.  But it does still happen occasionally.

To allow me to run base system test after each update.  If I kept it free of firmware I would never know if a sector of NAND went bad or any other possible time bombs.
What I actually do (and OP may want to do) is to keep two Trezors (I actually have three).  One I keep buried in the bomb shelter, the other two I keep regularly update and loaded with dummy seeds that represent low value balances.
I don't keep the high-value balances on a loaded device as a precaution.  If there is ever some exploit that would put it at risk, I prefer for it not to be loaded and out "in the wild".  
I don't really mind having a loaded one locked away, but thats only because I have a backup device.  I always assume the one locked away will require an update, and I always assume that update could result in a reset of the device.
Obviously I have watch wallets that track the high-value balances, but there is no HW wallet required for that.

You know that isn't technically a ***hardware-wallet***.  What you describe is typically called a hot-wallet.

Why people still think its OK to run backdated wallet SW is beyond me.


Could easily be added to r/Tails... yes.


Well the $900 is the ***minimum join*** it's not the fee.  The fee is going to be much higher (10x to 20x) the fee of Electrum.  Most tumbles will require many very large transactions over a few days.  These multiple large transactions is what causes the fees to feel so high.

Most would propose a soft-fork so that a new ***optional*** PC signing algorithm would be deployed.  In a soft-fork, all the pre-fork semantics would still work.  So for example... the segwit soft-fork means you add segwit but it is not required.
If you soft-forked, the old UTXOs would still be valid and if the private keys were ever solved via Shor's then a "legacy" transaction spending them would still be valid.
A "burn" would be mean that the protocol would blacklist all the old coins and reject any legacy TXN that employed them.
By contrast a hard-fork would mean that everyone would have to move their coins to a new PQ addresses, then at the time of the hardfork, a new genisis block would be declared.  In that case a burn would not be required, but would likely come with many complaints as people scrambled to move their coins before the deadline.
I'm in favor of a soft-fork without a burn.  I can't tell if you want a hard-fork or a soft-fork with a burn.  I assumed the latter.

There's plenty of time for QC.  You will see that coming miles away.  I think the chances of being "surprised" by QC are zero.  I'm more concerned about the underlying validity of ECDSA / secp256k1.  Not overly concerned, but certainly more concerned than QC.  The odds of someone brute-forcing ECDSA today is about 1 in 1.4 yotta-yotta.  I'd say the odds of someone finding a way to significantly ***weaken*** secp256k1-ECDSA in the next century are probably better than one in a billion.  Where ***weaken*** is an algorithm that would be susceptible to a 100 year brute force attack.
This happened (famously) to Dual_EC_DRBG, which effectively made it ***instantly*** vulnerable and significantly weakened it.  There just seems to be the tendency in the user community here to just jump to the 2^X math and start going on about "heat death of the universe".  Cryptography fails ***all the time***.  It almost always fails by being weakened first by side-channels, corrupt-curves, or weakened-start-vectors vunerabilities.  Having something like [secp256r1]( already rolled out would save us the long period of turmoil that doing an "emergency soft-fork" would entail.

Because it [costs a minimum of 1.5%]( per TXN to spend BTC currently.  If we ***ever*** get to the point where we get "BTC back" for spending, or even fees down to 0.10% then I would convert each paycheck to BTC and eat the 0.10% fee to spend.

Why do people [pay $660,000 for a parking spot](  Because of where it is.  The same ( although tortured^\* ) analogy could be made for Bitcoin.  All bitcoin are born in a block reward.  Those "spots" are buried deep under many levels of unbreakable cryptography and universally accessible to anyone in the globe.  The combination of cryptographically secure and universally accessible is what give Bitcoin its value.
\* I call it tortured since the analogy falls down when comparing various UTXOs.  Since Bitcoin is priced on... well bitcoin and not depth of the UTXO, the analogy is heavily flawed, but still somewhat valid... if you squint.

r/Coinbase, r/Binance, r/Kraken - They will likely ask for your ID and crazy amounts of information.  This is law in Canada.  You can buy anonymously but it will be staggeringly expensive and difficult. 


r/Trezor - Just plug in the "magic device" and go to the `trezor.io` website.  I really would recommend you start consuming all of the Andreas M. Antonopoulos videos and books you can find.  That will give you a bit of a secure footing.
Word of warning.  Forgetting something, or not following instructions with bitcoin is usually fatal.  If you send $80,000 to the wrong address it really is gone.  If you forget the password to your $30,000 wallet, no one will remember it for you.  Decide on a system to record secrets that doesn't use a computer and is impervious to flood, fire or traumatic brain injury.

* You can have 0.0 to 1.0 MiB of non-witness data (NWd).
* You can have 0.0 to 4.0 MiB of witness data (Wd)
The formula is as follows:
4.0_MiB &lt;= 4 * NWd + Wd
Wd      &lt;= 4.0_MiB - 4 * NWd
NWd     &lt;= 1.0_MiB - 0.25 * Wd
So you could end up with 0.5 MiB of non-witness and 2.0 MiB of witness-data.  So to get to a 3.7 MiB block, you would basically have few (or one) TXN that was almost all witness data. So you could have for example, 3.6 MiB_Wd and 0.1 MiB_NWd.

Not sure what minimum wage is in your region.  So if average about $250 per TXN and do about one per day... Yes, you can make $250 a month.

Any tax advice you get on reddit will be crap.  Drop $800 to get a real answer from someone licensed in your country/state/city in regards to accounting and tax.
My crap answer follows:
Usually when assets are passed to decedents, "cash" is taxed, but "assets" are taxed when gains are realized.  So if Satoshi (for example) passed all his UTXOs to children, grandchildren, or great-grandchildren, those UTXOs would only be taxed (generally) when the beneficiaries "realized" the gains (cashed it in for currency).  The arguments historically given would be that "These bitcoin may very well go back to 0.0001 USD/BTC" so its unfair to force a gain or loss by making the person convert an asset to pay a tax on something that might go to zero.

Well there are 1.2 Quadrillion USD worth of money in the world today.  I believe that includes bullion as well.
Right now the market cap of BTC represents one-ten-thousands of the "global money" or 0.014 %.  For one BTC to be worth 1 Million, it would become 1.4 % of the global money supply.  At $28 Million / BTC, Bitcoin would be ***HALF*** all all the "global money"
So yeah if you are all-in and you think that in 200 years there will be no more fiat, then Bitcoin maxes out at about $ 57 million, but by then (following the plot line), currency would be worth nothing.  BTC would just be denominated in BTC.  Wouldn't be worth while to talk about how much pieces-of-eight is was worth.  In this world, a ($5) gallon of milk would cost about 8.75 satoshis.

Yes true.  One expanse would be that you can have a cold SW wallet.
* Hot - the keys are on storage that is accessible by an operating system that is on the internet.
* Cold - The keys are not accessible by an operating system that is on the internet.
* SW - The keys are secured by a password, 2FA or (God forbid) unencrypted.
* HW - The keys are locked in HW and not accessible to anyone, even with a password.
So by that defintion, a HW wallet can never be hot since the OS (or user) can never access the keys.  This is possible since the HW wallet knows how to sign TXNs and will never show the keys, but only show the results of the keys use.
SW can be Hot or Cold as you figured out.

Main danger is that your seed is stored in the Electrum wallet file.  If anyone ever stole your laptop they could get your Electrum wallet file.  A password will not protect it.  Human passwords are a joke to a farm of GPU crackers.  You would need something like a 24 ***random*** word passphrase to be 256 bit secure.  Very few people generate passwords of that complexity.
You could use TPM drive encryption, but if you have an infineon TPM or are using an SSD, then drive encryption is likely worthless.

1. Google "KYC" and first decide if your OK with it, or want "total privacy".  Total privacy will be much harder and ***way*** more expensive, but know yourself and what you want first.
2. Read all the terms of service.  Seriously.  When you hear about people getting charged a 35% fee, I grantee they didn't read the terms of service.
3. If your OK with KYC, start the process on multiple exchanges.  There is a 20% chance that it flat out ***wont*** work.  If it fails, just cross that exchange off the list and move on to the next.
4. Learn the smallest bit of python.  Cryptocurrency is all software and knowing the smallest bit will make this all appear a bit more logical

Overstock CEO goes out and does CEO stuff to wine and dine folks since he's a BTC billionare and doesn't want the IRS to decide to tax him to death next year.  At one of his CEO parties, some young Russian lady comes up and shows an overtly suspicious amount of interest.  She starts asking about overtly political things asking if he ever goes to the White House, does he know Obama, could she come too.  He Nopes out of there.
Next day he calls the FBI and said "Hey this Russian girl was ***way*** too interested in me asking about meeting Obama and stuff.  You guys might want to check her out"
FBI says "Yeah, we know all about her, she's trying to peddle influence.  She's crazy, but if your interested in dating her, we could care less.  Just don't do nothing illegal and your good"
CEO dates young Russian, cuz why not.  She goes on an on about crazy stuff and wanting to meet the President... CEOs all like, whatever.
Year or so passes and Trump announces bid for WH.  FBI calls up CEO and says "Hey, you still have that Russian's number.  We'd like you to date her some more and bring around your political connections".  OK.. CEO says, cuz he's single and why not.. James Bond stuff.  They date and he takes her to all his CEO parties.
Few weeks later FBI starts talking about how CEO's girlfriend is master-spy head of KGB, super crazy covert hacker gonna nuke the world.  CEO says "WTF"... we talking about the same crazy lady you told me was harmless and then asked me to wine and dine.  Now CEO is covered in political stink and gets TF out of DC and NY.
Few years later FBI is talking about how Russian lady is Trumps handler for Putin and that POTUS is a Russian plant.  FBI drops names (including CEO).  CEO cries BS and says the FBI called him and asked him to date her.  Produces docs and call logs and stuff.

10^12 might not be as unrealistic as I had originally suggested.  But generally, moving to a wallet that supports 18-word or 24-word seeds would fix most all of your problems.
Also when thinking of complexity in key storage, think of how you would want your funds handled in your will-and-testament.  There are ways using multi-sig and timelock that would work, but it requires some pretty cleaver people to get it to work.
An easy compromise would be to give your lawyer a sealed envelope with an an ordering list on it, and keep a scrambled 24-word seed in your safety deposit box.
That way if your brother-in-law gets into your safety deposit box, he can't produce the key, and your lawyer can't produce the key without your safety deposit box.
As you know, this only works for a 24 word seed.  12 word seeds are likely too short.
Other option would be to put 4 x 12 word seeds mixed in your safety deposit box, and leave your lawyer and ordered list.  In the safety deposit box you can say, "only the first 12 matter".  Then your permutations jump to 48!/12! which is well beyond the power of any brute force.

I've been using it for a while and been pleasantly surprised at how well it works.  My wallets:
* Eclair Mobile (non-custodial LN wallet)
* Wallet of Satoshi (custodial LN wallet)
I liked Wallet of Satoshi since you pay a flat % fee for on-ramping.  Good for small $20 channels.  For something like $200 channels (or above) Eclair is cheaper until the on-chain miner-fee-market spikes.  Only problems I've had are:
1. No ability to have a low-priority close channel in Eclair, fees always set to "next block" (issue logged).
2. About 10% of the sites I try to pay to are non-routable in either Eclair or WoS.  Switch to one or the other helps.
3. Have to launch Eclair every few days so that it updates the dead-man-timer.  Offline too long will force close the channel.

Trezor or Ledger.  Anything else is just silly.  Reasons to pick each.
* Trezor - Because it is open source HW and open source SW.  It is far less likely that there are any hidden backdoors or NSA / 5-eyes, 9-eyes or 14-eyes portals.
* Trezor - Made in The Czech Republic which is not a member of the 5-eyes, 9-eyes, 14-eyes programs.  Ledger is made in France which is one of the 9-eyes nations that partners with the NSA on intelligence gathering.
* Ledger - Uses closed source HW which makes it harder for attackers to glen internal workings of the device and HW.
* Ledger - No party has ever claimed to have accessed secure storage before, where as Ledger [claimed]( they have penetrated the Trezor HW security with custom designed electrical equipment and delamination techniques.

The purpose of a bank is to offload the job of securing your money to a centralized party.  So you pay a company that specializes in security to secure your stuff.
If you want to avoid banks, you will also avoid security.  So yes to can do this through face to face meetings, and yes you might get scammed.  But if you're going to bypass the security of a bank, the job of security falls on you.

OP asked for an explanation on what the relation between a 100 millionth of a bitcoin was and a US dollar.  The proper relation is, of course, approximately a 10 thousandth of a dollar.
The US derives some of its fractional dollar language from the British powers of two.  Hence the half-dollar and quarter.  While it derives others  old roman and latin divisions of 10.  The "[dime]( from the French "disme" and the "[cent]( from the latin "per centum".
Since there isn't a common term in English or French for a ten-thousandth some derivation is needed.  A "per centum" of a cent, or a ***cenicent***.  Other altenatives would be a ***pennicent*** from "[penny]( though a penny is technically a twelth of a [shilling]( or a 1/240th of a pound.  Penny is also less commonly used in the US.  It is still used to describe the one-cent coin, although not used in describing denominations.

The money you've already transacted is locked, can't get it back till the timer expires... sorry for your loss.
If you want to try again, there are two options.
1. Use a bank wire (at opening bell) to deposit the money, then buys with that money should be instantly available.
2. Use a debit (not credit) card.  Those buys should be instantly available as well.
Both options are staggeringly expensive at coinbase, so be prepared to loose your lunch.  For cheaper options look at using the Pro platform or r/Binance, r/Kraken and r/Gemini.

Depends more on your University and degree track than anything.  Hate to say it, but the journey is a heck of a lot more important than the destination.
Many (US) schools do the Computer Science out of the "Science" college and Computer Engineering out of the "Engineering" college.  I did CompEng my first two years of college and CompSci my last two years.  Had a gap since there was a lucrative job contract I got offered while in school and I needed the money.
I choose CompEng initially because the school I was at funded the Engineering college to the exclusion of most everything else.  It drew great professors and fantastic course work.  Since it was Engineering, it required a full math load of Calculus, DifEQ, Number Theory.  Also required Physics I, II, and II.  At the time, I didn't think studying quantum mechanics would really have any bearing in my field (lol).
When I went back I choose CompSci since the second school wasn't as heavily funded in Engineering.  I initially talked to the Engineering departments and found the department heads and advisers to be real jerks.  The Science college was the exact opposite.  Nice helpful and flexible.  Plus my Engineering work gave me a free minor in Mathmatics from the Science college.  Decision made.
Ended up doing HW work for a HW company primarily due to the jobs I worked through college.  They could care less what I did in College.  I had to do the basic technical screening which was fine, but they honestly had more interest in my focus on math than any of my CompSci work.
All anecdotal, but I'll tell you from experience, talk to both the departments and if you find one run by jerks, choose the other.  College is unfair, and your dean and advisers are the kings.  Doing great in class won't always allow you to take the QC course that fills up early and no one can get.  Having an adviser that will "pencil you in" is worth more than you know.

You wouldn't need to test for bitcoin holdings, just test for checksum validity.  This could be done with one SHA256 operation per iteration which will be much faster than actually trying to extract a BTC address from a seed (which would fail on invalids anyway).

Governors are not supposed to influence federal policy, just as Presidents are not supposed to influence state policy.

Starting capital noted


Possible, but you'd have to float the first year of financing till crops came in.  Also, you will have to cover your water bill and property taxes unless you plan steal public water for the watershed (risky).  Once established you will just have to cover your annual tax bill and permits.  You will need to sell some of your goods at coop to cover this.
If the zombie apocalypse hits, the $1000 / yr to cover taxes and licenses may be what sinks you.


Good choice, but travel is expensive.  Even as the mobile homeless, you'll burn money faster than you think.


$120k won't buy you entry to anywhere but the US (which you are presumably a resident of already).  Slovenia may get you in for $50k, but Panama is $160k for a finance visa.  If you have a parent or grand-parent born outside the US, you could use their heritage to make the case.  Many countries (including Panama) allow this.  If you go for merit based visa instead of finance visa, you might get lucky.  If you are a doctor, civil engineer, or teacher there is enough demand in undeserved areas to make this happen.  Unfortunately many countries (except the US) will look unfavorably at any chronic medical conditions.  The world is a cold cruel place.


This would veto pretty much any thought (for me) of leaving the country.  Id suggest all your decisions put her medical care as the paramount priority and only then consider options that don't erode that.


Secondary income noted.


Based on your previous points, I don't think Panama would grant you and your wife a visa.  Even if they did, you can't work for the first year of residency.


You'll need to look at undocumented entry then.  Credit score and finance history is going to be 99% of your residency application.  Just apply for a visitors visa and overstay.  Outside of the US, the best place to do this is the EU.  They used to note travel in your passport so moving around a lot would raise flags.  Not sure if they still do document checks in the EU anymore.


Yeah, get off reddit and move funds to a HW wallet.  Avoid banks and safety deposit boxes.  Bury the gold under the old oak tree.  Gold won't oxidize like silver so it's better for burial.


If you're planning on the collapse of the west, $120k now could set you up to be a king once things go all Gilead.  When countries experience financial collapse those with hard assets (real-estate, gold, companies) make out great.  Only wage-workers get screwed.  The Venezuelan stock market has gone to exponential.  9k to 50k in the last year.  Same exact thing happened in the Weimar.  Point is, if things go to shit, and your properly invested, you will see your relative wealth stay stable.  A gallon of milk may cost $5000, but your 0.001 BTC will be worth $10,000.


If you already have residency outside the US, then go for it.  Might be fun.  If you don't have residency outside the US, either hunker down and invest in things that move counter to the collapse you fear, or just risk living undocumented in the EU (not UK).
Honestly though think you might want to lay off of network news and Handmaid's Tale.  Things are not going to be that bad.

I had to write my own.  What I ***highly*** recommend is that you know both the published fees (read terms of service) and the "spread-cost".  This is the amount they fake the quote (up or down) to make money at the transaction.  Either only trade on an open (published) order book, or pull out a calculator and see how much above/below spot your quote is before you agree.  You will find some quotes 5%, 10%, 20% off spot at times.  You can use Tradeblock or CoinMarketCap to find "spot".  They both are hated for different reasons.

1. You save up $10k-20k in USD or BTC
2. You request and receive and invite to Bakkt
3. You decide if you want to buy future or sell future
4. If buying future you exchange your $10k USD for an agreed upon amount of BTC on a future date.
5. If selling future you exchange your $10k BTC for an agreed upon amount of USD on a future date.
6. Your contract remains regardless of whether the market (spot) goes up or down.
IAMAFA, but that is what a traditional [definition of futures]( are.  Outside of speculation, one use case would be a merchant who wants to hedge against volatility.  If their expenses are in USD (almost certainly they are), holding BTC may come with some risk.  Locking that BTC (each day) into a future contract would take that risk off the table and let the merchant sleep at night.
For example if I had 2 BTC and wanted to ensure that I could use those 2 BTC to pay my Dec 2019 property taxes of $21,000, I could offer a Dec 2019 future contract to exchange 2 BTC for $21,000.  This would be a good deal for me since the current spot price for 2 BTC is $20,800, and current Dec 2019 2 BTC futures are trading for $21,400 (bullish).  I get above (current) market price, and take all my risk off the table.

Well sorta.... if they see you open a bitcoin wallet then they know you have bitcoin.  Then if they wanted they could steal your laptop.  Once they have your laptop they are a few bits of encryption from getting your bitcoin (more on that)


Your wallet may be password protected, and your drive may be encrypted.  Those are two layers of encryption.  If you think your passwords are strong.  If each password is 8 characters, that may just take a few minutes to crack.  If you have your name or username in either, it could take even less.

u/TheGreatMuffin has you covered for the most part, but I'd add a prerequisite.
Before securing Bitcoin you need to ensure you have basic internet/network security.  Most any HW wallet / SW wallet will require downloading or connecting to some site.
1. Learn SSL/TLS.  It's a great security protocol, but many people don't understand it enough to spot red flags when they arise.
2. Learn phishing vulnerabilities like IDN and DNS attacks and how to prevent them.
3. Learn PGP and how to use it to verify files.
4. Learn WoT (PGP) and how to use it to spot counterfeit signatures.

Since you asked for the cheapest, not the "most convenient" or "fastest" or "most loved".  All of these are mutually exclusive it seems.  The cheapest option is `pro.coinbase.com` which is about 25x cheaper than `
* Coinbase Pro ( requires settled USD ) - 0.15%
* Kraken ( requires settled USD ) - 0.16%
* Gemini ActiveTrader ( allows unsettled USD ) - 0.25%
* CashApp ( allows unsettled USD ) - 1.25%
* Gemini website ( allows unsettled USD ) - 1.50%
* Coinbase Mobile/Website ( allows unsettled USD ) - 3.50%
What you are paying for is the ability to use "unsettled funds".  Basically, coinbase gives you a ***very*** high interest loan and allows you to secure the price of bitcoin at the time you hit the button.  If you instead send the money to Coinbase Pro, or Kraken then wait until the funds are irreversibly settled (2-3 weeks), then you can buy very cheaply.

To be fair... PIT is offering 100x faster order execution.  It is ***NOT*** offering 1000000x greater order bandwidth.
What crushed coinbase (and most exchanges) is when the orders/sec jump from 100 to 1000000 due to some radical price swing.
I'd be fine with 2ms order execution if an exchange could prove to handle trillions of orders per second without having to "spin up bandwidth".  But we'll all be waiting a ***long*** time for just such and exchange.
Though to be fair, I would think that exchanges should allow queued limit orders or some variation of that sort when they are too underwater to serve market orders.  But that is just me.

Most of this conversation tracks back to a series of old articles from 2013.
* [New York Times: N.S.A. Able to Foil Basic Safeguards of Privacy on Web](
* [Wired: How a Crypto 'Backdoor' Pitted the Tech World Against the NSA](
* [Wikipedia "Concerns" Section]( (ref
The articles discuss a weakness in an ecliptic curve cryptography algorithm called Dual_EC_DRBG.  Bitcoin uses ecliptic curve cryptography algorithm called [secp256k1]( ECDSA.  Many people argue that Dual_EC_DRBG was just plain crappy and not intentionally hobbled.  Others suggest that the "crappyness" of Dual_EC_DRBG was intentional and that other algorithms (namely secp256k1-ECDSA) could also have an undisclosed / undiscovered weakness.
So this leads to two possible eventualities.
1. No weakness is ever disclosed for secp256k1-ECDSA and it survives until the heat-death of the known universe.
2. At some point, dozens, hundreds, thousands of years from now, secp256k1-ECDSA weaknesses are found and it looses favor.
If [2] ever happens, then there would be a fork to add a new signing algorithm for UTXOs, and everyone that had possession of their private keys would move their UTXOs to new addresses protected by the new signing algorithm.  All of the "lost-coins" would then be left under secp256k1-ECDSA.  If this theoretical secp256k1-ECDSA weakness was profound enough, someone may try to brute-force old lost secp256k1-ECDSA UTXOs, assuming that the weakness would allow something like 100 year brute-force attacks (unlikely).
[Here are Hal Finney's thoughts on secp256k1](
Footnote: It should be noted that secp256k1 is not an NIST curve, but rather one derived by a group called [Certicom Research](  So discussing corruption of this curve is discussing corruption of Certicom more than the NIST.

In order to day trade and beat the HODLr you need to do a lot more than beat the rate of return for the HODLr, you need to beat the HODLr by Y% where Y is the sum of:
* Fees paid on each trade (~0.25%)
* Spread crossed on each trade (~0.03%)
* Wire fees for moving in and out of fiat
* Miner fees of moving on and off of exchange
* Tax which will reduce winnings (15%).
Add to that the risk of keeping all your money on an exchange hot-wallet and moving too and frow many times a day.  If after all that, your ***convinced*** that you can make a killing, go for it.  A rare few will beat the market.  Those that don't give more fees to the exchange I use so help to drive down the fees for the rest of us.

It will be veiled in "safety".  They are really sourcing your deposit history and making damn sure that money has been in the account for a few years before you walk out with it.  They will also record the SN of all the bills issued and write up a report.  Your not getting 100k in circulated money, it will be fresh minted order SN.

1. You save up $10k-20k in USD or BTC
2. You request and receive and invite to Bakkt
3. You decide if you want to buy future or sell future
4. If buying future you exchange your $10k USD for an agreed upon amount of BTC on a future date.
5. If selling future you exchange your $10k BTC for an agreed upon amount of USD on a future date.
6. Your contract remains regardless of whether the market (spot) goes up or down.
IAMAFA, but that is what a traditional [definition of futures]( are.  Outside of speculation, one use case would be a merchant who wants to hedge against volatility.  If their expenses are in USD (almost certainly they are), holding BTC may come with some risk.  Locking that BTC (each day) into a future contract would take that risk off the table and let the merchant sleep at night.
For example if I had 2 BTC and wanted to ensure that I could use those 2 BTC to pay my Dec 2019 property taxes of $21,000, I could offer a Dec 2019 future contract to exchange 2 BTC for $21,000.  This would be a good deal for me since the current spot price for 2 BTC is $20,800, and current Dec 2019 2 BTC futures are trading for $21,400 (bullish).  I get above (current) market price, and take all my risk off the table.

r/Trezor.  With a HW wallet it is hard to get scammed.  Best HW wallet practices
1. Make sure you generate a new seed when you get the Trezor
2. Make sure you write the seed down and don't forget it
3. Never type your seed into a computer.
4. Whenever you send Bitcoin verify the whole address on the Trezor
Four steps and your safe forever.  You can add a passphrase for more security as well, most advise that you should.

You are a humorless fellow.


Well... kinda.  Your correct of course, but I think most might not read this correctly.  Technically the minimum bit-width in fiber-optics is one wave-length.  The fiber transmitters and receivers though require much less bit density in a fiber signal.  They are getting better, but the limitation is more in how ICs are designed today and less in "how many bits can we stick in a laser".  We can push more in a laser, we just haven't invented anything to pack or unpack at that rate.
Once we fit the maximum we can in a fiber cable, and the feasibility of laying more trans-oceanic fiber cables becomes unfavorable, the time for [LEO bandwidth]( will begin.  With LEO satalites we immediately get at 20-30% boost in speeds since the speed of light is ["faster" in space](
So yes, connection speed is related to the speed of light, but we have in no way "maxed out" what is capable because of the speed of light.

Two ways I know of.
 Andreas A. Method
1. Collect a BTC public key for your benefactors wallet called `btc_addr_a`
2. Create a new timelock address for 90 days in the future using `btc_addr_a` called `btc_addr_t`
3. Select one of your own BTC public keys from address called `btc_addr_b`
4. Create a new 1 of 2 multisig address using { `btc_addr_b`, `btc_addr_t` } calling the result `btc_addr_w`
5. Move all your BTC holdings to `btc_addr_w`
6. Every 60 days, repeat 2-5 which will generate a new `btc_addr_w` for you to move your funds to.
If the process goes without update for 90 days, your beneficiary can now spend the funds.  100% pure bitcoin contract.
 brianddk suggestion
1. Make a 24 word wallet, add a 4 word passphrase (from BIP39 words).
2. Take all 28 words and put them in a random order on a piece of paper (note their order).
3. Write below them "Once ordered, first 24 words are a seed, next 4 are a passphrase"
4. Put the paper in a sealed envelope named "Words"
5. Put the "Words" list in your safety deposit box, or wherever.
6. On a new paper, write the proper order to arrange the "Words" list { 28, 12, 18, 13, 9, 8 ... 4 }
7. Seal this in an envelope labeled "Order"
Give the "Order" envelope to your lawyer with instructions to open upon your death.
Someone in possession of the "Words" list would need to run 10^29 permutations to crack (9 billion years).  As long as you can keep the "Words" and "Order" lists separate your safe.  You'll need to think on ways to ensure they never meet before your death.

BTC advantages over BCH
1. Market cap.  May be unfair, but biggest market cap does matter.
2. More hashing power. Makes it more secure.
3. Anonymity.  Layer 2 has this feature.
4. Trust less instant payments. Layer 2 has this.  Zero conf requires some notion of trust against double spend.
5. Existing layer 2 protocols.  Although others could add it, BTC has already rolled it out 
I'll leave out why BCH is better since you never asked that question.

Technically they are not an EFT but a trust.  Perhaps this is why the regulators gave them a pass.  Plus they were in the market ***way*** before any of this CME crap began.  Honestly, I think they just filled out the paperwork and no one thought to flag it or object back in 2014.   The fact that they are the only one implies that regulators won't let people do this "trick" anymore.   Because of this (and other reasons), their price floats above their NAV.

Futures can be used to help stabilize volatility.  In the example below, someone can cash in on the bullish market sentiment without having to HODL for months risking a downturn, or cashing out early and reducing profits.
1. You save up $10k-20k in USD or BTC
2. You request and receive and invite to Bakkt
3. You decide if you want to buy future or sell future
4. If buying future you exchange your $10k USD for an agreed upon amount of BTC on a future date.
5. If selling future you exchange your $10k BTC for an agreed upon amount of USD on a future date.
6. Your contract remains regardless of whether the market (spot) goes up or down.
IAMAFA, but that is what a traditional [definition of futures]( are.  Outside of speculation, one use case would be a merchant who wants to hedge against volatility.  If their expenses are in USD (almost certainly they are), holding BTC may come with some risk.  Locking that BTC (each day) into a future contract would take that risk off the table and let the merchant sleep at night.
For example if I had 2 BTC and wanted to ensure that I could use those 2 BTC to pay my Dec 2019 property taxes of $21,000, I could offer a Dec 2019 future contract to exchange 2 BTC for $21,000.  This would be a good deal for me since the current spot price for 2 BTC is $20,800, and current Dec 2019 2 BTC futures are trading for $21,400 (bullish).

2. You request and receive and invite to Bakkt

The spread is the difference between the buy and sell.  For example, if you have $100 in CashApp and issue ask to buy Bitcoin then immediately sell it all back, you'll be left with $96.80 (assuming 1.6% on both buy and sell).  If you do the same thing on coinbase mobile, you'll be left with $92.80 since coinbase mobile charges a higher spread.  If you do it on GDAX, you'll be left with $99.69.

If you use something like bank-wire ($10 at CB, free elsewhere) you can get same day availability.  Best if you do it at the opening bell.

Historically when economies collapse, or revolution, yes real estate has been a very good holding.  Typically resource land, not improved property.  Farmland, forest land.  Being a land Barron will typically get you in hot water since your wealth is public knowledge and new governments generally will target certain groups like in the French and Russian revolutions.  But having a quiet and modest farm ( ~100 acres ) will generally keep most in the good graces of whatever group ends up on top.


As I mentioned, less revolutionary upheavals with hyper-inflation will generally squeeze out landholders through taxation.  In Venezuela for example, you may have property tax of one thousand Bolivars one year, and ten million Bolivars the next.  Generally governments will look at confiscating land under to guise of tax evasion.  It allows governments to stay in power longer through these types of seizures.

Wasabi look good, but dropping committing $900 to CoinJoin was more than I wanted to sterilize.  I'd end up needing it and moving it back to a tainted wallet and in turn tainting the whole mess.
JoinMarket looked good, but it doesn't support BIP84 so the TXN fees for the join are pretty hefty if your only talking about $100.
I can get a low cost custodial mix and only have to dedicated a small amount of BTC to the task.  Sure it might go up in smoke, but it's not much money and doesn't really make me nervous.
If I was trying to wash $1,000,000 then I'd definitely dedicate a few hundred dollars to Wasabi tumble with a ridiculously high anonimity set.

Signing messages using PTPKH is equivalent to [address reuse]( and can open the HODLr to k-value and other attacks.  If planning on HODLring for more than 40 years, you could intersect with QC attacks as well.

Bought 0.1 BTC for half a dozen people when it was cheap and gave them a paper wallet.  Told them "this is valuable, keep up with it".  I told them the money was "theirs" and that they had the only copy of it.  5 of the 6 threw the "magic internet money" in the trash, one kept up with it.  The one that kept up with it is a bitcoin fiend and talks to me often about it.  3 of the other 5  are still pissed at me for "loosing their bitcoin"

Well... depends on how thick your tinfoil hat is.  What you propose has a lot of holes in it.  They may seem like small holes, but they are there.  Main problem is the "put 1 seed per USB" part of the process.  You've exposed the private keys when you put them on the USB stick.  A cleaver virus or key logger could cache that knowledge and use it against you.  Odds are less than 0.00001% that you would have a virus able to persist in Tails resident in FW or on your router, but it is greater (just barely) than 0.00000%.  Depends on your paranoia.
Also, your keys are similarly exposed when you bring them all together.  Even though this happens seconds before you broadcast, a cleaver virus could RBF or CPFP the TXN out of the mempool.

Ahh... good point... I'll change the phrasology:


Yes, the wallet itself may not have a network stack, but if it is on an internet-connected host, I would consider it Hot.  To borrow a networking term, the host-OS will "bridge" the keys to the internet if the host-OS has both properties.


I do disagree here.  I don't consider an OS accessing a "wallet" as important as an OS accessing the private keys inside the wallet.  I'd actually argue that the private keys ***are*** the wallet, but perhaps that semantics.  Point is, Ledger and Trezor have their keys provably inaccessible to the OS or any part of the host.  They are (by design) a black box that unsigned TXNs go into and signed TXNs come out of.  The keys never leave.
Now we can argue implementations if you like, but a ***good*** HW wallet will force the user to confirm a signing action making it impossible to hijack without the user's consent.

The real problem isn't where you update from.  The real problem is when you skip the verification process.
My Electrum Upgrade steps are always:
1. Go to `electrum.org`
2. Use Alexa Page Rank to ensure the site I'm on is ranked &lt; 100k (avoid phishing).
3. Download latest Electrum Installer.
6. Set attributes to RO on binary.
4. Verify signature against `ThomasV` Key.
5. Ensure `ThomasV` [key is signed]( by Core devs like P. Todd and A. Schildbach.
7. Install from verified installer.
If that is how someone installs / upgrades electrum, they will be fine, regardless of how they are notified to upgrade.

Because ECDSA is used for signatures not encryption.  That's what the "SA" at the end stand for.  Signature algorithms are ill suited for encryption.  Just as encryption algorithms are ill suited for signatures.

Yes, but its a shit idea.  What you describe is called carrying keys from a "key-bag".  Problem is that core puts hundreds of keys in the bag, and you only grabbed one.  Anytime you spend from that key in core it will put your change on another key that you forgot to copy.  It will look like your funds just disappeared.
This is why HD wallets were invented.  You bring over the whole bag, instead of just a key.

I'd always thought that ATM money would be marked.  Scanning bill SN is super easy.  It is actually made with slightly magnetized ink to make reading it even easier.  Then those SN are also recorded by banks each night they receive currency.
So even if they did have $50,000 cash, they would have to launder it in multiple geographic locations without cameras or anything.
The fact that these guys rented a UHAUL and did it in front of a camera leads me to believe they won't be free for long.

Most countries have controls on fiat.  This means that any business selling BTC for fiat are going to have to perform KYC.  This is going to require and ID and a few day wait.  There are non-KYC ways to buy BTC, but they are going to be astonishingly expensive.  Here's a list I wrote for minors (without ID) trying to get BTC, but the same rules apply:
Some of these might be available to minors, or at least not care.  Read ***all*** the TOS.  Definitely stay away from KYC!
* [P2P exchanges (e.g., LocalBitcoins, Bisq, HodlHodl, Paxful, etc.,)](
* [Purse.io/earn]( (shop Amazon for BTC, must be 13yo).
* [Mmycelium Local Trader](
* [Meetup.com - Bitcoin]( or any meetup you can find.  Ask (discretely) to buy BTC for cash after the meeting.
* Buy altcoin then [convert to Bitcoin](  Different coins have different P2P buy options.
* Craigslist sell for Bitcoin (double the price and offer 50% off if paid with Bitcoin)
* Mining &lt;= Super crazy risky unless your a savaont, makeing a profit is hard.
* Work for crypto (mow lawns and offer 50% off if they pay with Bitcoin).
Please remember that the whole reason bitcoin is only for adults is that it is easy to steal.  If you proceed there is a 100% chance that someone ***will*** try to scam you.  Make sure you catch every scammer you encounter, or you will go broke fast.

Judging from your previous comments and the fact that CC fees don't really bother you, there is not advantage other than the "cool factor".  Only about 1% of the global population hold bitcoin, but if your targeting millennials in the tech sector that number might grow to 10%.  If your targeting Baby-Boomer senior executives that number would drop to 0.0000001%.
So talk to your marketing team and ask them what value they see in the "cool factor" given your business demographics.
Only other advantage would be if your a bitcoin investor.  In that case you could take your salary or profit share in bitcoin.  If your a BTC maximalist this would be reason enough to drop $100 to spin up a [BTCPi server](

TLDR: The `OP_SECURETHEBAG` op code creates a ***special UTXO*** that are only spendable by specific "child" TXNs. This allows the splitting of a few-to-many transaction so that they only pay priority fees on the "few" side. This secures their funding UTXOs against double spend, and allows recipients in the "many" pool to up the fees with CPFP if need be.  The "few" and the "many" TXN are linked with the new ***special UTXO***

From the bitcoin core side, [issue  has some good brainstorming and some interesting mockups.
From Trezor's side, they have [published some articles]( on how to run a full node with Trezor.  Basically its:
1. Run full `bitcoind`
2. Run `blockbook` localhost webserver
3. Run `trezor-webwallet` localhost webserver
4. Connect your Trezor to `trezor-webwallet`
web-wallet connects to blockbook which connects to bitcoind.  Same thing can be done with the Electrum stack, but as you said.  Not easy.


True it keeps getting good press, but Trezor and Ledger have a lot more market.


Yeah, if you got the block book stuff, the Trezor python API allows you to do everything offline and air-gapped.  That was one of the first things I tried.  Similar story for the Electrum solution.

What you describe can be done in the context of Bitcoin's BIP39.  BIP39 is simply a list 24 words that can be used as a "multi-tool" to do all sorts of things.  There are offline password managers that can use BIP39 to store passwords, or safe combinations, or GPS coordinates to buried treasure.
You can "break" BIP39 into two pieces that are useless while kept apart.  Goes something like this:
1. Generate a 24 word BIP39 seed (group of words).
2. Write it down on `page_1`
3. Scramble the order of the words and write that on `page_2` and label it "Words"
4. Determine the order the words on `page_2` would need to be put in to generate `page_1`
5. Write the ordering on `page_3` and label it "Order"
6. Give copies of the "Words" list to your family
7. Give the "Order" list to your lawyer, tell them to open it when you die
People with the either list are powerless to produce the proper seed.  To brute force the order would take 10^22 iterations (19,000 yrs).  As long as you keep the "Words" and "Order" separate your lock is safe.
Method is pen-and-paper simple, though doing something with the ordered-seed is usually "computer-ish", but at least air-gapped.

For QC, yes... you will see that coming miles away.  I think the chances of being "surprised" by QC are zero.  I'm more concerned about the underlying validity of ECDSA / secp256k1.  Not overly concerned, but certainly more concerned than QC.  The odds of someone brute-forcing ECDSA today is about 1 in 1.4 yotta-yotta.  I'd say the odds of someone finding a way to significantly ***weaken*** secp256k1-ECDSA in the next century are probably better than one in a billion.  Where ***weaken*** is an algorithm that would be susceptible to a 100 year brute force attack.
This happened (famously) to Dual_EC_DRBG, which effectively made it ***instantly*** vulnerable and significantly weakened it.  There just seems to be the tendency in the user community here to just jump to the 2^X math and start going on about "heat death of the universe".  Cryptography fails ***all the time***.  It almost always fails by being weakened first by side-channels, corrupt-curves, or weakened-start-vectors vunerabilities.  Having something like [secp256r1]( already rolled out would save us the long period of turmoil that doing an "emergency soft-fork" would entail.

Well if your buying $5 worth, you just give them $5 cash and your receiving address and hope they send it.
If your buying $5 million worth, I would do something like this.
1. Reserve a conference room at your bank or at the local police station.  They do offer this to residents.
2. Ask the seller to meet you at the bank or police station and you bring your briefcase of cash.
3. Before you meet ask both you and your seller to BTC-sign a message with a BTC address and ***public*** key.
4. Use the two public keys (yours and theirs) to make a 2of2 multisig address.
5. When you meet ask the seller to send the BTC to the multisig address.
6. Once the BTC is secured in the multisig address with 6 confirmations allow the seller to inspect and count your cash.
7. Once the seller is satisfied with the cash craft a spending TXN from the multisig address to your Ledger address.
8. Ask the seller to sign the multisig spend transaction.
9. Add your signature to the multisig spend transaction.
10. Broadcast the multisig spend transaction.
11. Wait for 6 confirmations of the multisig transaction and allow the seller to leave.
Now not sure if you want the $5 method or the $5-mil method.  There are escrow services that could be used that will do all this for you, though they may hold authority over the funds for some time (risk).

Google made a custom problem to solve by a QC.  They then kept adding qbits (quantum "processors") until the QC solved the custom problem and the conventional computer timed out.  They theorize that the conventional computer would take 1000 years to do what the QC did in a few hundred seconds.  Assuming the "conventional computer" was a massively parallel max GPU solver capable of a trillion computations per second then the QC was capable of doing 2^67  operations per second.
Now assuming for a second that their QC was optimized to factor secp256k1 given a public key, then it would still take the QC 2^128 cycles to solve.  This would translate to the QC taking about 68 trillion years to derive a secp256k1 private key given a secp256k1 public key.


Every time funds are ***spent*** from a secp256k1 address, its pubkey is encoded into the transaction.  If a QC is ever invented that can factor secp256k1 privkey from a pubkey in under 10 minutes, it is possible for an attacker to double spend any TXN in the mempool.  More likely though if someone had that type of QC they would use it to spend Satoshi's coins who's pubkeys are already known since they were P2PK not P2PKH.
Assuming that this will happen in `x` number of years from now, the bitcoin blockchain would need to fork to ad a new PQ (post quantum) address.  Any coins stored in a PQ address would be safe, though the TXN fees to spend PQ coins may be high.  Most people put the value of `x` at anywhere between 40 and 200 years.  A realistic estimate of the time it would take a fork to roll from alpha to mainstream availability is likely about 2 years.

There are brain wallet miners that walk the blockchain.  Most every movie and book quote has already been hashed.  The miners then have a list of known addresses, pubkeys and privkeys that they continuously scan the mempool for.
When the multisig spend TXN is broadcast, the redeem script contains pubkeys on the miners known address list.  They would immediately try a RBF spend on that TXN and any other funds locked by that address.

Coinbase does a shit job of detailing in their TOS how long it will take funds to "settle".  CB is actually worse than most any other bank in regards to documenting this (if you think of CB in terms of banks).
That being said... all exchanges or fiat-to-btc brokers will hold BTC until the FIAT txn becomes "virtually irreversible".  In BTC, the threshold for "virtually irreversible" is usually 6 confirmations (one hour), though there are some rare occurrences where TXNs roll back after 30 confirmations, but they are rare.
For FIAT, it all depends on how the money is sent to determine the threshold for "virtually irreversible"
* Fed-Wire: 1 day or less (minutes if you do it at the opening bell).
* Debit-Card: 2-3 days.
* ACH: 2-3 weeks.
* Credit-Card: 2-3 months.
Judging by your screen grab, I'm betting this was an ACH buy.  If you pay the $10 for a wire, it would be someday (if done early).
For what its worth.  The TOS says that it will take "5 days or more" which is "technically" correct, but still pretty misleading.  But you certainly should have expected ***at least*** a weeks delay after reading the terms of service.

HW wallet would be the safest.  I wrote a [complicated script]( to get Trezor's web-wallet to work in tails, but it isn't for the faint at heart.
Plus, once you have it on a HW wallet, you will have to realize that keeping it offline for years will almost grantee that the firmware will become out of date.  Jumping from a 2019 FW to a 2021 FW will mean you have to be real sure you didn't forget your seed or passphrase.  A frighteningly large portion of people do.

30 million customers with a 99.9% customer satisfaction rate = 30,000 very pissed off customers.  Enough to fill any subreddit.


Hope your talking about Pro, otherwise there is about a 4% fee you left off.  The maker/taker fee on Pro is 0.50% or 0.005 not 0.0005.  But yes... it is $5 per $1000.  Keep in mind an ACH into CB will trigger a 21 day hold.  You can pay $10 and use a wire upfront for sameday-ish availability.  If your FOMO you should wire in and out of all exchanges.
@_date: 2019-06-11 00:22:49


No, it is not safe.  The copy included in tails is a few revs back and there was a major defect since then.  You have to update Electrum (AppImage) to the latest copy.  [I have a script]( to do it, but there is a paint-by-numbers howto that might be easier to follow.
Once update Electrum is fine, but you have to updated it every few weeks to stay on the cutting edge.
If you don't want to do that, you can also use the Trezor web-wallet in Tails (with my script above).  The security is high since its a HW wallet, anonymity is OK since it is on TOR.
What you probably want is Samorai or Wasabi.
@_date: 2019-10-21 03:19:13


Well CB is safe, sure, but are ***you*** safe?  The problem with exchanges is that people use guessable passwords or weak emails.
If I was evil I'd check password databases for all users named Toshi and see if I got any hits.  Reddit was hacked not to long ago, so maybe I get Toshi's real email or phone number.
Now maybe Toshi uses the same ( or similar ) user name on coinbase as is used on any of the other accounts associated with Toshi.
If a clever person gets your coinbase email, user id and phone, they can pretty easily reset your password and take ownership of your account.
Technically not CB fault, but Toshi's.  If you don't have a completely unique userid, email and password used only on CB, then think hard about leaving a balance on an exchange.
Main risk is user error, not exchange fault.

There is still some work to do here.  Here is where this usually breaks down:
1. Bitcoin needs internet or SMS + central hub.  So as long as the "unbanked" aren't getting extorted by the centeral-hub, or internet providers this works out.
2. Bitcoin needs a crypto-processor.  Many of the unbanked have smartphones that can perform this function.  So long as the unbanked aren't extorted by the smartphone dealer, this works out.
3. Fiat "on-ramps" availability.  Many of the unbanked are at risk of being extorted by the fiat-on-ramp.  P2P face-to-face exchanges can mitigate this, but there are still some governments that will severely punish anyone caught exchanging currency.
Soon there will be a global internet market (LEO satellites) that will take care of 1 (and 2 by proxy).  The bitcoin satellite was a nice start, but most of the unbanked don't have a 300 GB SSD for block data.  Perhaps there are some auto-pruned Android full nodes to fill this niche, but I don't know of any yet, and TXN broadcast is still needed.
@_date: 2019-02-24 20:57:11
LOL... term "secret" is grossly overused.  I'm not talking about the "secret" that GAuth spits out that you punch into 2FA, I'm talking about the "secret" the website gives you on the day you set up 2FA.  If you recall you used your phone to scan a QR code.  That QR code was a "secret".  If you were to print that page and bury it under an oak tree, then that same QR is all you need to set up the same GAuth 2FA.
If you don't believe me, take your friends phone and set up a GMail burner account.  Once set up, install GAuth on your phone and your friends phone.  Then go to set up 2FA and print the page that they have the QR code on.  Set your phone up then wait a week and ask your friend to install GAuth and scan the printed QR code.  Now put your phones side by side and open GAuth.  You will notice they are synchronized spitting out the same 2FA "secrets" every 30 seconds.
If your smart, you don't print the QR code and instead copy the 8-75 digit GUID that is on the same page as the QR code.  Then you can store the GUID / secret / backup-code / magic in your password database and sleep easy knowing your funds are not depending on your phone not breaking.

* [Purse.io/earn]( (shop Amazon for BTC, must be 13yo).
* [Mmycelium Local Trader](
* [Meetup.com - Bitcoin]( or any meetup you can find.  Ask (discretely) to buy BTC for cash after the meeting.
* Buy altcoin then [convert to Bitcoin](  Different coins have different P2P buy options.
* Craigslist sell for Bitcoin (double the price and offer 50% off if paid with Bitcoin)
* Mining &lt;= Super crazy risky unless your a savaont, makeing a profit is hard.
* Work for crypto (mow lawns and offer 50% off if they pay with Bitcoin).
Please remember that the whole reason bitcoin is only for adults is that it is easy to steal.  If you proceed there is a 100% chance that someone ***will*** try to scam you.  Make sure you catch every scammer you encounter, or you will go broke fast.

Nodes can charge any fee they want.  I've connected to nodes (Wallet of Satoshi) that charged 0.30% on all TXNs.  It is simple enough to charge 20.0% on all TXNs.  Since you have to do a first hop through the node they can garantee they collect the fee on all funds moved from layer-1 to layer-2


Your right, that may eventually come to pass with the new EU AML5 (or whatever they call it), but it just isn't the case right now.  I think it will only be a problem for KYC based exchanges.  The [non-KYC exchanges]( have always seemed to maintain a "don't ask, don't tell" policy on tainted coins.


Doesn't quite work like that.  Today when you open a channel you give layer-1 coins to the node to get layer-2 coins back.  The one who gives you layer-1 coins is the loop operator.  Which, as you point out, could choose to give you tainted coins.  But one of the beauties of running coins through an exchange is that event taint seems to be diluted away.  Most coins comming out of an exchange aren't tainted simply because they have been in a big enough collection of other coins that tracking them is beyond "due diligence"


Maybe in the UK, but the US simply uses that rule of "due diligence".  What that is is obviously up to interpretation, but for layer-1 it is trivial to track coins until they go through an tumbler, exchange or coinjoin.  No one is claiming that Binance was required to track taint through the coinjoin, but instead binance decided that the process of coinjoin was in and of itself "taint".  They could (at any time) decide that Lightning channels were also de-facto taint, and perhaps they will.  But for now they don't seem to be.

Perfect Entropy is another problem.  Unless it's using atomic decay, its imperfect.  What's more, entropy has a bad tendency of getting worse the smaller the computation power is that generates it.... generally ([source](
This is not a new problem and created heartache for Android users in the past ([source](
I had seen threads asking if entropy could inputted into Trezor.  This would consist of them selling [dice]( with the device and allowing you to use them to generate your key.  I really think they should offer this solution as its better than any computer or mobile device can generate. 
So why is entropy important?  Because of grouping.  Imperfect entropy produces grouping.  If the grouping is tight enough war dialers can be used to "mine bitcoin keys".  This is futile if the assumption is that the key is anywhere in the set.  But if a subset can be bound to a smaller field this could eventually make war dialing profitable.
As I mentioned earlier... this has happened before, not on Trezor, but because of poor entropy.

Bitcoin for dummies... I agree.  I think there are few veterans that really understand ECDSA transaction signing.  I barely get it, and haven't even delved into SegWit or atomic swaps yet.
I think the elevator pitch needs to morph.  For years everyone seemed to have the Anarco_Capitalist "Down with the Fed" tatoos.  I try to explain it as "Renting a locker in Fort Knox".  A bitcoin address is unbreakable (assuming entropy).  The value is in the fact that the locker is in Friggin Fort Knox!  Does kinda fall apart when they ask what's in the locker.

No... the whole universe knows this, not just Coinbase and govt.  Every TXN is stored in the blockchain which is public to everyone... everywhere.  Coinbase hot wallets are well known and it will not be hard for anyone to scan the blockchain and determine which TXNs are Coinbase TXNs.


You need to read some books on big-data and data-mining.  The way most of these things work is by collecting as many unique pieces of data and seeing what unique identifiers are related to each other.  For example u/WeakHands_Trader has a post history, is there anything in that post history that will shed light on their country, timezone, native language, gender-identity?  Any other social media have a  userid?  Same process on all the other social media sites.  Next you can check leaked password databases.  These can be used to associate userid with emails.  If an email is found for u/WeakHands_Trader, then perhaps it is of the form Joe.Smith
Now I know that WeakHands_Trader is Joe Smith and he attends or teaches at Predue.  This is iterative and each new connection triggers a new scan to get more information.  Eventually bitcoin addresses could get pulled in as the mining determines what likely IP addresses WeakHands_Trader has used.
You can avoid this... but it is very, very, very difficult to live the type of lifestyle that doesn't leak a lot of this data.

I've seen a large volume of articles talking about Bitfinex and Tether being a time bomb in the bitcoin market.  There are many posts so I won't rehash them.
My question is.. what is the Affirmative argument.  Points I have on the other side (bullish on bitcoin) are as follows:
1. Bitfinex + Tether are only &lt; 30% of the volume... much less than MtGox
2. Tethers daily volume is $590 Mil -vs- Bitcoin volume of $3803 Mil... So only 15% of bitcoin trades.
3. Tether.io might be telling the truth and actually have $590 Mil in their reserves account in HK.
4. Tether.io might be taking huge infusions of cash from other exchanges like Kraken.
5. The spike in Tether releases in market dips could be institutional customers ($10 Mil +) grabbing Tether to buy the dip.
Again... I'm just trying to get the other side of the "Tether will end the world" matra.

It's hard to get because of KYC and AML.  Governments put up a firewall between fiat money and BTC in the form of KYC and AML.  This means anytime you want to convert fiat to BTC (what we call a "buy") there are mountains of government paperwork to fill out.  There are sites that fly under the radar of this, but they charge and arm and a leg because of the huge risk they take working on the edge of what is "legally" allowed.
If you live in a free society seriously consider your political voice and question whether this level of government intrusion into private commerce is really what you feel a free society should look like.  In the US political spectrum the desire to dis-entangle government corruption from private enterprise generally falls under r/Libertarian, though the movement has the same flaws as most political movements.

If I were doing it....


Exchanges, Banks, and other companies sell their customer data to marketing companies.  If its sold to marketing companies, it is likely on the darknet somewhere.  Sites like bitcointalk and other focused groups have had their user database hacked before as well.  If you cross reference all the data leaks with all the marketing data batches, you could likely get a large list of potential targets.
Part of the discipline of data-mining is to automate the continual reduction of a data set as well as finding points of correlation between datasets.  So assuming these users used the had one "primary" email used on a few dozen sites and the one "primary" phone used on a few dozen sites, there is bound to be one data breach that ties that user's email to their phone number.  Then its just a simple scan of the bitcointalk breach to find any email listed in their user database.
I'd guess that 10%-20% of the bitcointalk users have a coinbase account.  So... now you have a list of maybe a few thousand users and from there you can reasonably assume you have a few hundred coinbase customers.  
Once you have the email and phone number, and possibly the name, it's simple enough to check a reverse phone database to determine which provider owns those numbers.

OP... it's great that your thinking about backing up your 2FA, but give serious thought to using the "Auth token" model.  This is called "TOTP" and is riddled with security holes.  The best 2FA is U2F (aka Yubikey).  If TOTP is the best you can do, than definately take it, but ***never*** use TOTP (Auth app) on any site when the far superior U2F is available,
From worst to best.
1. No 2FA - Anyone with $1,000 and access to a Tor browser can buy some password databases that will inevitably have one of the 30 million Coinbase users in there.  I grantee, one of them used the same password on Coinbase as they did on Yahoo or BitcoinTalk.
2. SMS 2FA - As OP found out, anyone with $100 can pay off a T-Mobile rep to port the number.
3. Google Authenticator - Susceptible to [MiTM attacks]( and [Hashcat](  LocalBitcoins had confirmed MiTM attacks on accounts with Google Authenticator active.  It did not slow or deter the attack.
4. [U2F]( (Yubikey) - No one has ever broken a U2F secured account.  No one has even theorized any way that it can be done.

The US civil forfeiture and AML laws do not side on customer rights unfortunately.  If coinbase is claiming the seizure as part of an AML investigation you basically have to sue to prove you aren't laundering money.  Most people just give up.  I'm sure CB will likely return the funds after a 5 year window the the unclaimed money fund for the particular state that the account was opened in.  I just have suggestions to get the money before it goes to the unclaimed fund desk.
No one here is asserting that the AML and civil asset forfeiture laws would pass a constitutional test.  Hopefully some of the folks affected by this will bring class action and eventually supreme court cases to challenge those laws.  I just don't belive that will ever happen.

Because by dismissing the idea of running your own full node, you broke the very ethos of bitcoin in your opening sentence.  Everything after that is irrelevant.
Trezor, Armory, Electrum, they all are compromises to the original ideal and offer various trade-offs along the way.  If the trade-offs were a "bad deal" no one would use them and their use would dry up.
So, if you want to experience the "main objective" of Bitcoin, run your own node.  If you choose to run Trezor, Armory, or Electrum you have made the choice to make the trade off.  You don't ***have*** to make that trade.  So the "main objective" is still in effect.

All auth sessions are signed by a private key in a secure element in the device.  The back-end service gets the public key at initial device registration.  Once the device is registered, no future session can be hijacked because no one (including the browser) has the devices private key.  And the only one who has the public key is the backend server.  The public keys are not derivable from any future session data outside of registration.
So an attacker would need to compromise the registration and all future auth sessions.  And this can only work if the device has a faulting FW rev that allows origin spoofing.  Here's a walkthrough of the protocol and the faulting FW CVE (below)

The guy who said "Hey, bitcoin is awesome... I just got two pizza's for 10,000 BTC" thought he was being clever in 2010, not so much now that the potential value of that is over 70 million now.
What happens in 50 years when someone finds out... OMG... Did you see that some guy named u/Moideha claimed to have 100 million satoshis back in 2019.  I wonder if he still has any of that now.

Sorry for your loss.
You ended up on the "expensive" side which is the default.  The cheap side is called "Pro".  Coinbase and Gemini both have a default "expensive" side and a cheaper side (Pro / ActiveTrader).
Here are the maker fees for US exchanges, though might not help you in the UK.  Maker fees:
* r/Binance - 0.10% + 0.001 BTC withdraw fee
* r/Kraken - 0.16% + 0.0005 BTC withdraw fee
* r/Gemini - 0.25% (quoted fee requires "ActiveTrader)
* r/Coinbase - 0.50% (quoted fee requires "Pro")
* r/CashApp - 1.8%

100% Agree.  For me, it was no difference setting my DCA up in this manner or setting it up in a blind buy.  In both cases my daily workflow is:
1. Deposit some USD
2. Buy some BTC
3. Run a python script
Since I like running the scripts to calculate my cost basis and other account telemetry, its a simple matter for me to add some downward trending limit orders.  For me (and possibly only me) it reduces FOMO and FUD influences since my main FOMO drive is to "buy the dip" which this does automatically.
So yeah, if I didn't already have a daily script I was running, it might be more complexity then I wanted to take on, but since I am, it was a simple addition.

**I am not a CPA** 
But as far as random tax advice from a stranger goes.... BTC is taxed when it is ***sold***.  The amount that it is taxed assuming you sold BTC for USD, is `amount_of_usd_you_got_from_sale - amount_of_usd_you_spent_to_aquire`.  So if Alice gave Bob 1 BTC, Bob would pay $0.000 USD for that 1 BTC.  If bob sells the BTC in 10 years for $100,000 then he would pay long-term capital gains tax on `100,000 - 0` or $100,000 USD.

I see the biggest threat being DC.  Here are my BTC nightmares (since you asked)
1. CME start selling options, and DC insiders buy millions in short contracts (insider trading is legal for federal legislators).  Once they have a short position they go about breaking up all the exchanges (bitfinex, tether, kraken, etc).  BTC gets Mt.Goxed when all the exchanges have their reserves frozen and price goes into a freefall, shorts activate, profit.
2. An Environmental Zelot wins office and sees Cyrpto mining as the worst, most pointless, CO2 producer on the planet and goes about shutting down crypto, to reduce demand, to drop hashrate, to reduce CO2, to save the children.
3. CME / Wallstreet go big on a short position, loose their shirts then go after crypto for spite.  The James Dimon effect.
4. Crypto profits hit the point where the IRS goes nuclear on it starts walking the blockchain for people to audit.  Since all transactions are traceable, any chain that goes through an exchange could be tracked to a taxpayer.  If the IRS / NSA / FinCERN were to take all the known send / receive addresses of all US depositors, they could write a blockchain spider to calculate capital gains of all those transactions.  90% of US bitcoin (non-holders) would be subject to an IRS audit.  Madness.
5. Quantum computing is born making ECDSA cryptography trivially crackable.  All addresses have to move to new Quantum crack-proof addresses and those in paper wallets or HW wallets are wiped out.

I don't know who has sold the most units Ledger or Trezor.  They are both ranked about equally on Alexa ([trezor]( [ledger]( for what its worth.  I would think either one is fine if that is what you are after.
Rule of thumb.  If your storing less than &lt; 0.1 BTC, it probably doesn't matter.  If your storing &gt; 0.1 BTC then you should likely get a reputable HW wallet.  DYOR as to which set of features.
I gravitated to Trezor because of its open-sourceyness, and as a python programmer, I can understand all their source with less effort than the Ledger source code.  Unless your a python programmer, your decision process will likely be different than mine.

close enough... yes


essentially... yes.
Few gotchas.  
1. Not all 12 word seeds are compatible.  BIP39, Electrum, LND all use different formats.
2. The passphrase is mixed with your 12 word seed to produce your keys, don't forget it (if enabled)
3. Your derivation path is important.  Moving your seed to a different wallet may not guess your derivation.

Their premise is basically, "We are vets, who service vets" and so they generally give a far more trust to customers (vets) than other banks do.  So when you deposit to USAA, they will just give you a 0% loan for the deposited amount until it clears.

Just use a BIP39 seed.  Here's what I suggest.
1. You pick any BIP39 wallet and write down the seed, passphrase (if any) and derivation path.
2. Also grab the Address in the derivation path you will be depositing to.
3. Plug the address into any block explorer of your liking to get the full "query URL".
4. Shorten the URL using any URL shortner of your liking.
5. Send 0.05 BTC to the address and ensure it arrives.
5. Put the seed, passphrase (if any), derivation path and URL in a Gift card.
6. Keep a copy of these for your own records (forever).
7. Gift the card to the person or family.
There are other things that will do most of this for you like OpenDime, but what I outlined is simply what I would do.  Don't forget to keep the information in your own records for at least the next 50 years.  There is an extremely high probability that despite the persons best intentions they may loose or forget the seed.  It would be nice to simply re-gift it to them in 10 years.

To all advising Google Authenticator, or Authy, or TOTP... don't.
There is a hierarchy of 2FA, but if you suggest anything, you should suggest the best option.
From worst to best.
1. No 2FA - Anyone with $1,000 and access to a Tor browser can buy some password databases that will inevitably have one of the 30 million Coinbase users in there.  I grantee, one of them used the same password on Coinbase as they did on Yahoo or BitcoinTalk.
2. SMS 2FA - As the article points out, anyone with $100 can pay off a T-Mobile rep to port the number.
3. Google Authenticator - Susceptible to [MiTM attacks]( and [Hashcat](  LocalBitcoins had confirmed MiTM attacks on accounts with Google Authenticator active.  It did not slow or deter the attack.
4. [U2F]( (Yubikey) - No one has ever broken a U2F secured account.  No one has even theorized any way that it can be done.
Finally, most HW wallets already have a U2F ability built into them.  Ideally a single use U2F device is better, but Coinbase (and others) screwed up their U2F implementation since you can't add multiple U2F devices (last I checked).  This pretty much requires that people use some recoverable U2F device like a HW wallet.

There is a long history of HD wallets of the BIP32, BIP39, and BIP44 variety.  Of these hundreds of wallets released over the last 5 years, some used non-standard, or yet-to-be standardized "places".  Most recovery services have simply spent the time to review all of these wallet derivation paths to come up with a "heat map" for where coins were likely to land.
Technically derivation paths can be 8 x 32 bits.  The 256 bit keyspace is one of those "more than all the protons in the universe" size numbers.  I garantee no wallet recovery service is starting at `0x0000....0000` and going all the way to `0xffff....ffff`.  They are making some logical best guesses.

In the event that an exchange steals funds, in most English speaking courts, only adults have standing in the court.  Which is why it's difficult for OP to get BTC as a minor.

Yes.  $55 for a Trezor and you can use it as:
1. Crypto vault
2. Password vault
3. U2F (2FA like Yubikey) vault
4. GPG vault
5. SSH vault
Worth the money even if you never use it for [1].


It all comes down to OPSEC and that is a subject far to broad for a reddit post.  There are many good books on the subject and courses on it.  Here are some tips.
1. Always assume every computer / phone you are on has malware and viruses on it.
2. Learn what GPG/PGP is and use it to verify all downloads and messaing.
3. Encrypt your harddrive and your cell phone.
4. Use a 9 digit RNG pin for your cell phone encryption ***NOT*** biometrics.
4. Make all UserIDs RNG generated and unique between accounts.
5. Make all Passwords RNG generated and unique between accounts.
6. Some 2FA is still better than no 2FA.
7. Always use U2F / FIDO based 2FA.  Avoid SMS and TOTP (Google Authenticator).
8. Only use open source software and firmware wherever possible.
9. Always run an AdBlocker or an AdBlocking browser.
9. Pen and paper is better for passwords than dropbox.
9. Make your email security as serious as your exchange account security.
9. Get a protonmail account.
1. If you don't care about privacy, install *Alexa Traffic Rank* and check the rank of all pages.
1. If you do care about privacy, learn what CRLs are and use them to manually verify SSL certs.
1. The unlock icon in the URL bar means ***UNSAFE*** and avoid using these sites.
1. The lock icon ***DOES NOT*** always imply safety, lots of scammers can get a green lock.
1. Get a HW wallet from the manufacturer not ebay or Amazon.
1. Never use a preloaded seed on a HW wallet.
1. Never enter your seed into a HW wallet's SW or Web interface.
1. Most people are dishonest, assume any interaction with a counter party will result in fraud.
There are more... hence the reference to finding a good book.

Great job brother.
Now take it to the next level.  
1. Move your 0.125 BTC to a new ledger generated wallet secured with a passphrase (much better security)
2. Create a "dummy" passphrase or empty passphrase to hold your "decoy funds" in case robbed / mugged
3. Explore the U2F feature of Ledger and use U2F as your 2FA on all your accounts instead of SMS or Google Auth
HW wallets are really awesome and should give you great peace of mind.

If your going to do it, Here's what I suggest.  Some other methods would require sketchy middlemen.
1. You pick any BIP39 wallet and write down the seed, passphrase (if any) and derivation path.
2. Also grab the Address in the derivation path you will be depositing to.
3. Plug the address into any block explorer of your liking to get the full "query URL".
4. Shorten the URL using any URL shortner of your liking.
5. Send 0.01 BTC to the address and ensure it arrives.
5. Put the seed, passphrase (if any), derivation path and URL in a Christmas card.
6. Keep a copy of these for your own records (forever).
7. Gift the card to the person or family.
There are other things that will do most of this for you like OpenDime, but what I outlined is simply what I would do.  Don't forget to keep the information in your own records for at least the next 50 years.  There is an extremely high probability that despite the persons best intentions they may loose or forget the seed.  It would be nice to simply re-gift it to them in 10 years.

[Casa makes a product]( to do this.
Here's what I've done, though I might move to Casa eventually
My spouse and kids know where a sealed note is.  Inside the note is instructions on how to query my crypto balance via `xpub` and where to find my seed.  The instructions are simple, but in such a way that only my benefactors could realistically execute them.
My will names a specific member of my family as the cryptography executor to my estate.  This executor will be in charge of the decryption of my personal files for my family as well as disposing of the cryptocurrency according to their wishes.
The executor does not know my seed and will only be given the seed once my benefactors have verified the balance in the wallet.  If BTC moons and the amount becomes more than the executor can be trusted with, my benefactors will need to think of a way to add legal teeth to the probation of my estate.
Basically my `legal-will.txt` and a `where-is-the-seed.txt` files are both clear-signed with my PGP key and are replicated in separate geographic locations.

I used to have 3 HW wallets, and many (many) mugger's wallets.  I used to keep the following things "safe"
1. The "real" seed
2. The "real" passphrase
3. The derivation path to the "real" funds.
Everything else was just a vessel.  As to "how" I kept those three things safe.  Etch them in steel, encase in lacquer and put in your bomb shelter.  Or something like that.

Yeah... bitcoin works off of something called "keys".  They are secrets that only you know.  If anyone else finds them, they "win" your bitcoin.  Most bitcoin software today ("wallets") use something called a "seed" or "mnemonic" with the aid of a "passphrase" of your choosing to encode the secrets ("keys").
1. Don't tell anyone your seed or passphrase.
2. If someone asks for it, say no.
3. Don't forget your seed or passphrase.
4. If your forget your seed or passphrase, your coins are lost forever.
5. Forever means you will never get them back.
6. If you download "Bitcoin Pro" and enter your seed and passphrase into it, you will be robbed.
7. Never give sketchy SW your seed or passphrase.
8. If you don't know if SW is sketchy, than its sketchy.
9. Don't forget your seed or passphrase.
10. If someone said your bitcoins are corrupted and they need your seed and passphrase to repair them, they are lying.
BTW... don't forget or disclose your seed and passphrase to anyone... ever... for any reason... at all.
Think that about covers it.

We, as a country, will have to, balance our budget, stop all deficit spending, and go through some serious austerity measures before anyone will be able to stop the printing press.  This is not going to happen in an administration that is running on ***expanding*** entitlements.

3. Resign yourself to Apple madness.
More on point [3] since it may garner attention.  Many years ago when Bitcoin was young Apple made a sweeping statement that Bitcoin was bad and unilaterally removed all the Bitcoin apps from the App Store.  That pissed off some of the top talents in Bitcoin which is why you usually see wallet apps launch on Android first.  As the years go on and new developers enter the space you have less people holding that old grudge against Apple.  You are ***slowly*** getting more and more Bitcoin apps in the Apple space.

You can't, unless the vendor puts in safeguards.


Yes, GPG will allow you to verify a free form blob of text.  But in order for it to work, you (or the plug-in) would need to:
1. Get a signed invoice from the vendor
2. Get the vendor's public PGP/GPG key
3. Trust the vendors public PGP key
To achieve [3] you can see if the vendor's key is signed by anyone "reputable".  This gets into WoT, but there are plenty of texts on it.
By the way... "signed free form text" would look something like this.  I'm only using my reddit PGP key so it is not signed by anyone reputable, but its a simple example.  If you change any of the monospace text below it is very easy to detect.

Timeframe?  Ever is a fuck load of a long time away.  If the question is "Before our sun goes nova", then absolutely all lost bitcoin will be mined from the ledger.  In 20,0000 years I suspect cryptography will be ***way*** beyond where it is today.  QC farms driven by AI oracles will be able to get most of the old P2PK addresses, and any address that came from a known XPUB, shared signed (text) message, or the result of address reuse.
Though I suspect you really mean in the next 50 years.  Yeah in the next 50 years, them coins are gone, and ain't coming back any time soon.


Well in 20,000 years all ***active*** bitcoin will have moved to PQ addresses so it will be a big nothing burger.  The influx of new coins will definitely swing price, but only for a few years.  A blip in the grand scale.


Yes.  99% of the people on this planet still think bitcoin is a joke.  When I gave my folks 0.1 BTC yars ago, they eventually threw the paper wallet in the trash when they were cleaning up.  They wouldn't have done that with a gold coin because 100% of the world understands gold is valuable.

1. You pick any BIP39 wallet and write down the seed, passphrase (if any) and derivation path.
2. Also grab the Address in the derivation path you will be depositing to.
3. Plug the address into any block explorer of your liking to get the full "query URL".
4. Shorten the URL using any URL shortner of your liking.
5. Send 0.01 BTC to the address and ensure it arrives.
5. Put the seed, passphrase (if any), derivation path and URL in a Christmas card.
6. Keep a copy of these for your own records (forever).
7. Gift the card to the person or family.
There are other things that will do most of this for you like OpenDime, but what I outlined is simply what I would do.  Don't forget to keep the information in your own records for at least the next 50 years.

Find a BIP39 wallet.  This is the format that is most compatible.  You will need 3 things
1. Seed - 9, 12, 18, or 24 words.  AKA mnumonic
2. Passphrase - Extra security to seed.  Can be any string of 50 to 100 characters (not all wallet support &gt; 50).
3. Derivation Path - This is where your coins are stored.  It can be "derived" if you loose it, but best to keep it.
With those three you can recover any BIP39 wallet to any other  BIP39 wallet.
Put those three things on paper, or stamp them in metal and store them some place safe.

My preferred method is to use BIP39 seed and a BIP39 passphrase and split both using SSSS.  Inefficient, but secure, standardized, portable and understandable.
1. Create a 12 word BIP39 seed to be used as a passphrase.
2. Take the first 4 chars of each word to convert the seed to a 48 char passphrase.
3. Use [SLIP-0039]( SSSS implementation to split seed/passphrase into shards.
4. Create another 12 or 24 word BIP39 seed to use as your main seed.
5. Use [SLIP-0039]( SSSS implementation to split seed into shards.
Now your passphrase can be recovered using the shards from [3] and your main seed can be recovered from the shards in [5].  You don't have to handle hex or base58 strings, everything is in word-lists like common BIP39 seeds.

You contradict yourself here, and this is also where your security failed.  Unless your wicked good an long math by hand, you had to use some software (wallet) to convert your "seed" to an "address" for deposit.  Once this is done, you are no longer the "only person" who knows the seed.  You explicitly had to give the seed to a wallet to get the deposit addresses.
Same goes on the other end (withdraw).  Eventually you will have to take that seed and put it into a wallet to sign the spending TXN to withdraw the funds.
So you have to "share" the seed twice.  Once to get the deposit address, and once to generated the withdraw transaction.
For me... the only safe way to handle a seed is in a HW wallet.  These are proven to leak 99.9999% less than any other wallet.

Had a similar idea.  Feel free to steal it.  Goes something like this.
* Get a batch of a dozen generic 512 GB SD cards from china for about &lt; $120
* Copy the entire Bitcoin mainnet, and Testnet blockchain
* Throw on some [par2]( recovery files to tolerate 20% (or more) failure on sectors
* Sell them for ~ $20 each
Obviously $9 SD cards at that capacity will be crap, but with parchive an astonishingly high number of sector failures are survivable.  Block data is automatically checksum'd so there's no risk of getting any malware on it.  I figure $20 might be worth it for some folks to not have to do the download, or buy a new SSD for bitcoin-qt.

Basically you can choose a short passphrase like `correct horse battery staple`, then augment it with the Yubikey to add a complex tail like `G6O+\b5NDqJyBT5JM)P/u`.  Gives you an insanely secure passphrase with a bit of memory and a little HW fob.

not a good idea.


[Shamir's Shared Secret]( is pretty cool.  But remember, you have your seed, passphrase, and derivation path you need to record.  Most of what you've outlined only covers the seed.  Don't leave off the other two.
Besides Shamir's Secret you could also use a scramble technique on a 24 word seed.  12 word seeds are too few to scramble.  To use a scramble, make two lists, one with your 24 words out of order, and another list with the order corrected { 5, 3, 1, 9, 4, 18 ... }.  When the two lists are combined, you have your seed.  Possessing one without the other is useless.  It would take `24!` (factorial) attempts to unscramble (which is a lot).


GPG is your friend.  Plus you can move your key to a CCID HW device like Yubikey to avoid having it electronically stored anywhere.  Just don't loose your Yubikey or hope it never breaks.

For / Against
Reasons why it's not Tulip Mania
1. Market cap is too big - Tulip mania -VS- the Dutch stock market was inconsequential.
2. The spike were futures - Tulip mania went manic when they started trading futures.  Those investors never held bulbs or cultivated tulips... they just swapped future contracts.  The spike in BTC are people actually buying and hoarding BTC.
3. Tulip bubble burst by supply/demand curve imbalance - Two factors that triggered the end was the loss of population (plague) shrinking demand while at the same time supply exploded due to the tulips 7 year maturity cycle.  Bitcoin cannot oversupply... its fixed.
4. Too long-lived - The tulip bubble inflated and popped in one season (6 months).  Bitcoins bull run has been far too long to be an adequate comparison.
Reasons why it IS Tulip Mania
1. Bitcoin is an intangible good - There is no hard asset backing BTC, unlike stocks, so there is no way to give it a proper valuation.  Tulips were equally worthless other than their value compared to yesterday, coupled with the status of having them.  They served no utility other than vanity
2. Bitcoin is unregulated - The Tulip Mania was the result of unregulated markets run amok.  Same thing almost happened in Turkey till regulators squashed it.  This is what happens in unregulated markets.
3. Bitcoin investment is primarily "average" people - One of the reason Tulips took off was because very few serious economists / financiers were in the market.  It was generally traded in pubs after many drinks by the middle class with little education in finance.
4. Cause the graph looks identical - I mean just look at it!

The author probably wrote Authenticator but meant Authy.  Authy does have a sync feature that has SMS in the workflow.
If someone ported the users phone they may have been able to reset the users Google password, then restore app data backups and possibly get Authy to sync.

We'll there isn't ***really*** cash exchanged.  It's all accounting.  The liquidity requirement is so that the banks can open in the morning, but once they open they can move as much cash as they want.  So, if I understand, what happens is this.
1. Banks closes and starts counting cash.
2. Bank determines it can't meet federal / state requirements to open in the morning.
3. Bank signs over the deed to some / all of their real estate to the federal reserve.
4. Federal reserve allows the bank to count the borrowed money in the liquidity to open.
5. Bank opens doors then pays back the fed the loan plus interest to regain their deeds.
Loans are only taken for a few hours.  It's all just a shell game.  I'd imagine the money "invented" for the repo just goes back on the fed balance sheet just like all the QE money the invent every year.

1. Wire the $500 into Coinbase.  Your bank takes a $25 wire fee and Coinbase takes a $10 wire fee
2. You use the $465 to buy at 7170.63, and Coinbase takes a 3.8% sale fee
3. You now have ‭0.06247385 BTC
4. You send it to your wallet and pay a 0‭.00006498 BTC fee receiving ‭0.06240887‬
5. Price goes up to 50K so you send your BTC to Coinbase and pay a ‭0.00006498 BTC fee 
6. You receive ‭0.06234389‬ and sell it at the 50k spot paying a 3.8% fee receiving $3,003.07
7. You wire the money to your bank, paying coinbase $10 and your bank $25
8. Your $500 investment grew to $2,968.07 netting a $2,468.07 gross
9. You pay the IRS $913.19 in taxes leaving your total profit at $‭1,554.88‬

I posted this in the daily since I don't think most want to see day-trader posts.  I can move it to the main board if anyone thinks there would be interest.
 Subject: A Martingale based trading strategy
Investopedia: [Forex Trading the Martingale Way](
I know these strategies have been around for centuries, but here's a brief rundown on what I'm fleshing out for 2020.  This isn't a perfect martingale strategy, but it was the easiest to code in python. It's a variation of DCA with a few modifications.
The basic concept is buy the dip and sell the spike, but with weighted bands positioned as a pyramids of limit orders.  Once we decide how broad the buy/sell range will be (given 10% in this example), we will position our buys and sells to commit more and more the further into that band we dip.  Basically creating a pyramid.
Something like this
* 1st-Band at 2% below spot.  Buy 0.001 BTC
* 2nd-Band at 4% below spot.  Buy 0.002 BTC
* 3rd-Band at 6% below spot.  Buy 0.003 BTC
* 4th-Band at 8% below spot.  Buy 0.004 BTC
* 5th-Band at 10% below spot.  Buy 0.005 BTC
Here's a more concrete example
 Example data:
* Assume BTC/USD price is $7500
* Assume a holdings of 0.050 BTC at a cost basis of $7600 (bear market)
* Assume I am doing a weekly DCA of $100 to my portfolio
* We will structure buys from 0% to 10% below current spot
* We will structure sells from 0% to 10% above our current cost basis.
So given the the spot of $7500 and a $100 investment to distribute, our bands will be as follows:
 Buys
* 1st-Band at $7350.  Buy 0.001 BTC
* 2nd-Band at $7200.  Buy 0.002 BTC
* 3rd-Band at $7050.  Buy 0.003 BTC
* 4th-Band at $6900.  Buy 0.004 BTC
* 5th-Band at $6750.  Buy 0.004 BTC
 Sells
* 1st-Band at $7676.  Sell 0.001 BTC
* 2nd-Band at $7752.  Sell 0.002 BTC
* 3rd-Band at $7828.  Sell 0.003 BTC
* 4th-Band at $7904.  Sell 0.004 BTC
* 5th-Band at $7980.  Sell 0.005 BTC
* 6th-Band at $8056.  Sell 0.005 BTC
* 7th-Band at $8132.  Sell 0.006 BTC
* 8th-Band at $8208.  Sell 0.007 BTC
* 9th-Band at $8284.  Sell 0.008 BTC
* 10th-Band at $8360.  Sell 0.009 BTC
So between $7350 and $7676, nothing happens for the week.  If the price swings outside that HODL band, then I'll start buying if it drops or selling if it spikes.
I have a bit of python to build the bands, but excel could do it as well.  Once you determine how many bands you need, then you just redo them ever week.  Here are the basic rules to do every week to set this up.
1. Every week re-evaluate your cost-basis for how much you have invested in BTC
2. Every week re-evaluate your Sell and Buy bands (I used 10% in the above example)
3. If you had any "Sells" trigger from the previous week, add that to your DCA investment
2. Build your "Sell" pyramid based on your current cost basis and current holdings
3. Build your "Buy" pyramid based on your DCA investment and the current spot price
4. If our current cost basis is below spot, set our "Sell" pyramid off the current spot price.
4. Clear all of last weeks limit orders
5. Add all of this weeks limit orders
6. Check back next week

@_date: 2019-12-20 12:14:55
I think your missing the point.  Bitcoin has a distributed public ledger.  Everyone can see every transaction all the time.
BTC-LN can (as you say) have a point to point private ledger.  Both sides of the channel can log all BTC-LN TXNs and report them to whomever they want.  This is a similar comparison to SSL -vs- HTTP.  In an SSL connection, both the client and the server can choose to log whatever they want, but no third party can see what they are doing unless one of the two primary parties tells them.  Sure the third party may know through link layer analysis that the two parties had a conversation, but they have no idea the content of that conversation.
So to wash coins in BTC-LN you would do the following.
1. Find a node that doesn't care about your coin taint (Bob).
2. Open a channel to Bob.
3. Loop out the balance of your coins to a third party (Carol).
Now Carol and Bob both know about the channel-open since that all happened on the public ledger.  But Carol has no way to source the funds she got in [3] unless you (Alice) or Bob tells her about what happened ***inside*** the channel.

It's certainly not the cheapest option, but it is still an option.  Reason you have so many people raging on it is that they have over 30 million accounts, have crazy strict terms of service, ban users for life, and have worse tech support than the cable companies.  With that many customers, even a 99.9% customer satisfaction rate would leave you with 30 thousand pissed off customers.
Here's the most common exchanges in the US.  I assume the US since you didn't say otherwise.
* r/Binance - 0.10%
* r/Kraken - 0.16%
* r/Gemini - 0.25% (requires ActiveTrader)
* r/Coinbase - 0.50% (requires Pro)
* r/CashApp - 1.6%
Be aware, both Coinbase and Gemini default their customers to something like 3%-4% fees.  You have to use either Pro or ActiveTrader to get the "free stuff" and competitive fees.  This is another reason most hate coinbase.
BTW.  All these exchanges have FOMO fees.  If you try to wire in money to "buy today" its going to cost you.  If you send it over ACH (slow as hell), you won't have to pay the $25 wire fee.  Just the 3 week wait for your money game.
P2P and ATMs are also an option, but very few of them will have fees below 0.50%

Safest way is not to deal with paper wallets.


BIP39 is more widely implemented than "Scan private Key".  Just gift the BIP39 info.
Here's what I suggest.
1. You pick any BIP39 wallet and write down the seed, passphrase (if any) and derivation path.
2. Also grab the Address in the derivation path you will be depositing to.
3. Plug the address into any block explorer of your liking to get the full "query URL".
4. Shorten the URL using any URL shortner of your liking.
5. Send 0.01 BTC to the address and ensure it arrives.
5. Put the seed, passphrase (if any), derivation path and URL in a Christmas card.
6. Keep a copy of these for your own records (forever).
7. Gift the card to the person or family.
There are other things that will do most of this for you like OpenDime, but what I outlined is simply what I would do.  Don't forget to keep the information in your own records for at least the next 50 years.  There is an extremely high probability that despite the persons best intentions they may loose or forget the seed.  It would be nice to simply re-gift it to them in 10 years.

Sounds like your asking about custodial or exchange wallets.  That's a mixed bag and it is entirely up to the custodian or exchange how they will factor fees.
For non custodial wallets the fee can be payed by the sender, receiver or both.  The most common is "sender pays".  To have the receiver pay, the sender broadcasts a no-fee TXN and the receiver pays the fee in a linked "CPFP" transaction.

Bitcoin losses will go down as the price goes up.  When the price was $0.00000001 USD/BTC the loss rate was fairly high since who cares about some worthless magic internet money.

Friendly reminder after the SIM swap story today:
To all advising Google Authenticator, or Authy, or TOTP... don't.
There is a hierarchy of 2FA, but if you suggest anything, you should suggest the best option.
From worst to best.
1. No 2FA - Anyone with $1,000 and access to a Tor browser can buy some password databases that will inevitably have one of the 30 million Coinbase users in there.  I grantee, one of them used the same password on Coinbase as they did on Yahoo or BitcoinTalk.
2. SMS 2FA - As the article points out, anyone with $100 can pay off a T-Mobile rep to port the number.
3. Google Authenticator - Susceptible to [MiTM attacks]( and [Hashcat](  LocalBitcoins had confirmed MiTM attacks on accounts with Google Authenticator active.  It did not slow or deter the attack.
4. [U2F]( (Yubikey) - No one has ever broken a U2F secured account.  No one has even theorized any way that it can be done.
Finally, most HW wallets already have a U2F ability built into them.  Ideally a single use U2F device is better, but Coinbase (and others) screwed up their U2F implementation since you can't add multiple U2F devices (last I checked).  This pretty much requires that people use some recoverable U2F device like a HW wallet.

If you are serious about mixing in either BTC or BCH then by far, the best solution is to swap to and from XMR and you are 100% private.
If your just toying with privacy, then I you have two choices, BTC-LN or Coinjoin.  Your adversary will generally be able to guess (based on good analytics) when you go through a BTC-LN or Coinjoin TXN.  Eventually with Schnorr TXNs on BTC will make it harder for an adversary to tell if you were in a Coinjoin or BTC-LN channel.
So right now adversaries don't know ***what*** you did after a coinjoin or in a BTC-LN channel, just that you participated in one of those activities, at least until Schnorr.  So the two ways to fix that are either to implement Schnorr, or get adoption of Coinjoin, and BTC-LN into the 50% percentile.  If half of all TXNs are BTC-LN channel creations, there will be very little chance that an exchange will forbid UTXOs with that type of TXN history.
So... Should I move all my BTC to BCH because they have Schnorr.  No.  I've I'm going to move to a different chain for privacy, I'll just jump to XMR and back.

I literally have no idea what you just asked.
@_date: 2019-12-03 20:43:54
My [previous answer]( to a similar question
Most risk isn't in storing the seed... its recovering the seed.  Any time a private key is given to an operating system you are at risk until the funds that key is releasing are confirmed in a block.  You may have mad ninja skill OPSEC, but I always assume that no computer or OS (even tails or Raspbian) is secure.  Maybe it's secure enough for a $100 UTXO, or a $1000 UTXO.  But what happens in 50 years when those UTXOs are worth millions.
When you use Raspbian, you basically say "I trust the guys that developed this not to steal my keys" or at least "I trust random strangers to read all their code and validate it".  Problem is that Raspbian is literally millions of lines of code.  Something like coldcard and trezor are 100x or 1000x smaller codebase.  Less code to attack, less code to review.  Higher confidence.
In my opinion... The two things a HW wallet does better than anything else are:
1. Generating a seed in a way that is disguised from the operating system.
2. Using a key to sign a TXN in a way that is disguised from the operating system.
For the years that your HOLDring , I think it matters not whether that thing in your safety depoist box is a laminated paper wallet or a laminated seed, passphrase, derivation-path.

Well I assume you've already engraved the steel... nothing to be done now.
But as a general question to future readers:


Here's a write up I did before SSS was widely available.  Basically, you use a 24 word seed, and don't divulge the proper order.  Now days, I might suggest a SSS based solution though.
Your best bet is to encode the seed while in transit, then decode when you arrive.  You will want to give all your beneficiaries the decoder.  You can do it in a way that your beneficiaries and the TSA can not independently derive your seed.
1. Have all your beneficiaries create a GPG key (proton-mail would be easiest).
2. You will send them a GPG encrypted message that any of them can decode.
3. Take a deck of cards and write the numbers 1-24 on 24 cards.
4. On the back of each card write the seed word corresponding to that number.
4. Put your hat in the middle of the room, close your eyes and throw the cards in the air.
5. Sort the cards based on how far they landed from the hat.
6. You should now have a random sorting of the numbers 1 through 24.
7. Write the ***numbers*** of each card { 2, 12, 18, 5, 9... etc } in `order.txt` on your computer.
8. Encrypt `order.txt` to `order.asc` with GPG.  Send it to your beneficiaries (and yourself).
10. Write the seed words in `words.txt` file in the order the numbers were in.
9. `/usr/bin/shred -u` the text files.
11. Go to the airport and through TSA
Even if a cleaver TSA agnent snaps a picture of your jumbled seed phrase it is out of order.  If they are cleaver they can write a python brute-force to rearrange the words and test the checksum word for validity.  The would have to run `620,448,401,733,239,439,360,000` permutations to find the right combination.
If you only have a 12-word seed, then you will need to add 12 "dummy" words.  Go to and online bip39 tool and generate a 12 word seed in your language.  Now take that 12-word seed and append it to your ***actual*** 12 word seed.  Leave instructions in your encrypted message to your beneficiary that the seed is complete after the 12th word and the rest are just padding.
Now the TSA agent would need to run far too many permutations than a lifetime would afford, and your beneficiaries know the order, but not the words.  Neither can create your seed from the knowledge that they have.  Your beneficiary would need to team up with a TSA agent that saw your scrambled seed to piece it all together.
Real danger comes if the TSA agent disassembles your crypto-steel.  In that eventuality you really are screwed, unless you happened to memorize your seed words.

It's possible (maybe), but the compromise would have to exist at the time that the U2F is initially set up and stay compromised throughout the use.  Even then, I'd probably need some convincing.
But if you set up U2F using the [TorBrowser on Tails]( or some other good OPSEC, any subsequent compromise would be clear.
So there may be some window, but it is a lot smaller than SMS or TOTP.  And as you said, that is only a theory at this point.  No one has published a working U2F exploit yet.  But many TOTP exploits have already compromised accounts.

1. You pick any BIP39 wallet and write down the seed, passphrase (if any) and derivation path.
2. Also grab the Address in the derivation path you will be depositing to.
3. Plug the address into any block explorer of your liking to get the full "query URL".
4. Shorten the URL using any URL shortner of your liking.
5. Send 0.01 BTC to the address and ensure it arrives.
5. Put the seed, passphrase (if any), derivation path and URL in a baptism card.
6. Keep a copy of these for your own records (forever).
7. Gift the card to the family.
There are other things that will do most of this for you like OpenDime, but what I outlined is simply what I would do.  Don't forget to keep the information in your own records for at least the next 50 years.  There is an extreamly high probability that despite the families best intentions they may loose or forget the seed.  It would be nice to simply re-gift it to the child when they graduate college, or med-school, or at their wedding.

***Technically*** any valid Bitcoin TXN or any fork-coin TXN (without reply protection) could be rebroadcast to the Bitcoin mempool forever, so long as the original UTXOs were still unspent.  These are basically signed-checks with no expiration date.  Only thing preventing some vandal from resubmitting every TXN that has ever timed out is... well resources.
That being said... resources is a big deterrent.  Someone would have to really hate Bitcoin to hold the petabytes of never-confirmed-still-valid TXNs.
So best way to ensure an old TXN is not used as cannon fodder by some future vandal, is to simply spend that UTXO so that any rebroadcast would be invalid (double-spend).

* [ELI5: Two Factor Authentication (2FA)](
Now that you know what 2FA is, the next part is "what is the best 2FA".  Well... as stated in the linked post, the ***point*** of 2FA is to prove you are in possession of something (phone, app, hw-fob).  So you want one that really can not be counterfeit or impersonated so it ***really*** is you that has the "something you have" bit.
So, it is ***very*** easy to impersonate your phone.  This makes SMS 2FA worthless.  All a bad guy has to do is give somebody at AT&amp;T $20 and they can take your phone number, which would give them all your SMS.
The app (Google Authenticator) is also ***very*** easy to impersonate.  The codes are weakly encoded so an app like hashcat can crack them trivially.  They are also easily defeated by phishing.  So if someone uses a virus to mess with your computer and redirect your browser to `cⲟinbase.com` instead of `coinbase.com` (the `o`s are different) they could impersonate your Google Authenticator app.
The only form of 2FA that really proves "something you have" are the little Yubikey hw-fobs when used in a form called U2F.  At coinbase they call these ***security keys***.  So given the option between SMS, Google-Authenticator, or U2F, you should always choose U2F.

Since your posting on r/bitcoin, and asking for direct recommendations, here are mine.
1. Buy a Trezor-T from `shop.trezor.io` (see r/Trezor)
2. Get Electrum and pair your Trezor to it (see r/Electrum)
3. Store your seed words securely
4. Any software / site asking for your "seed words" is a scam
5. Never enter your seed words into a computer or site
6. Never store your seed words on a computer or in the cloud
11. BONUS: Enable a passphrase on your Trezor for better security
12. BONUS: Determine the derivation path of your funds
8. BONUS: Load the Trezor bitcoin-only firmware for better security
7. BONUS: Get GPG and perform the download verification steps for Electrum
8. BONUS: Get a USB key and run r/Tails off of it
9. BONUS: Perform download verification steps on Tails
10. BONUS: Use your Trezor paired to Electrum running off Tails
11. BONUS: Enable persistent storage on Tails to maintain a persistent wallet
13. BONUS: Securely store your seed, passphrase, derivation path, and wallet for next of kin.
Ideally you would get through all 15, but getting the first two probably gets you where you need to go.  I choose to recommend Electrum since it is one of the most popular wallets and any question you have about electrum can be answered by lots of people.  I like the default Trezor wallet a lot, but Electrum on Tails offers some nice security levels that are really next level.  If you can only make it through step [1], then you are likely "good enough".

Argument: Tether and BitFinex are linked and tether is minted from nothing and used to buy bitcoin pumping up the value of bitcoin.
Affirmative (for above argument): 
* Bitfinex is behind on their release of public audit data.  
* Thether.io (the tether mint) has a blurb in their terms of service that says "Tether is not redeemable for any fiat currency"
* Tin-foil hat says that CME will short BTC then send their buddies in DC over to break up Bitfinex profiting from the short.
* Bitfinex no longer accepts US deposits or withdrawals.  May have lost TW, HK and EU banking abilities as well.
* FBI is still investigating Bitfinex BTC hack.
Negative (against the above argument):
* There is no irrefutable proof that Bitfinex is holding fractional reserves (holds less money than it claims).
* There is no irrefutable proof that Tether.io is holding fractional reserves.
* BitFinex+Tether make up less than &lt; 30% of the BTC/USD(t) trading volume.  So much less than Gox
* Tether (USDT) market cap only amounts to 15% of BTC market cap.  So not that much.
* Bitfinex and Tether are adamant that the accusations are unfounded.
* Lots of people hate bitcoin.
Don't hate, just trying to answer OPs question.
Disclaimer: I hold BTC, and trade on a BitFinex competitor.

Punching a seed on sheet metal, covering it with lacquer and stowing it in the "bomb shelter" is likely the best your we get a "normal" user to do.
Ideally, as you said, Every whole bitcoin worth of savings would be secured in its own multisig wallet, and each signatories seed would be split using SSSS.  The shards for the seeds for the multisig for each bitcoin would be uniformly distributed in hardened bunkers across the globe.
That is best, but no one is going to do that.  Things like Trezor and Casa-node can do a lot of the heavy lifting for users, but most will gravitate to the "free-trial" of electrum-pro edition before they realize that there is no such thing.
I realize no one will do what they should, so I'd prefer just to get them to the steel-punch phase personally.

As u/igadjeed mentions, most BTC recipients lose it.  Not recommended.  If your not dissuaded... here's what I suggest.  
Some other methods would require sketchy middlemen, so this is the "purest" solution:
1. You pick any BIP39 wallet and write down the seed, passphrase (if any) and derivation path.
2. Also grab the Address in the derivation path you will be depositing to.
3. Plug the address into any block explorer of your liking to get the full "query URL".

Don't forget to keep the information in your own records for at least the next 50 years.  There is an extremely high probability that despite the persons best intentions they may loose or forget the seed.  It would be nice to simply re-gift it to them in 10 years.

It's quite easy to spoof "top sites" on the darknet.  Unless you have some fairly good OPSEC, there is a low to fair chance that you were scammed.
1. Are you doing this exclusively from Tails
2. Have you verified your tails download with GPG/PGP
3. Have you verified the GPG/PGP keys that signed the download with WoT
4. Have you verified the onion address letter for letter
5. How confident are you that the DNM site has not been hacked on their backend.

Sure...  the private key of 0x000.....0001 has tons of transactions on it.  Other ***poor*** private keys have transactions as well.  If you do ever collide you should consider the PC, mobile, or HW wallet that generated the collision 100% crap.  The point of a RNG is to land you out in the "middle of nowhere" in the field of addresses.  If it doesn't that means the RNG is flawed and other likewise flawed RNG will hit the same collision.
So in a world of imaginariy perfect RNGs,  will a collision ever happen?  No... Never... Ever... not until enthropy reverses gravity inverts and the dark matter collects the universe into another big-bang.
But in a world full of crappy RNG.... you bet.  Luckily crappy RNGs are getting rarer and rarer by the day, but that doesn't make them impossible.

That being said... basic intelligent use is required.
1. Always verify the address you are sending on the Ledger HW (not the SW).
2. Never enter your seed into the SW, only use the HW.
3. If the app says to reset your device and restore to the following seed `all your coin belong to us`.... don't.
3. If an app called "Ledger Pro+" says, "Congratulations, you won, enter your seed to claim".... don't.
4. Really... don't enter your seed in the SW.
5. If the SW asks you to move all your BTC to the following address `bc1thisisgoingtohurt`.... don't.
I know it all sounds obvious.  But don't do silly things and you'll be fine.

Here's and old reply I made about that:
My spouse and kids know where a sealed note is.  Inside the note is instructions on how to query my crypto balance via `xpub` and where to find my seed.  The instructions are simple, but in such a way that only my benefactors could realistically execute them.
My will names a specific member of my family as the cryptography executor to my estate.  This executor will be in charge of the decryption of my personal files for my family as well as disposing of the cryptocurrency according to their wishes.
The executor does not know my seed and will only be given the seed once my benefactors have verified the balance in the wallet.  If BTC moons and the amount becomes more than the executor can be trusted with, my benefactors will need to think of a way to add legal teeth to the probation of my estate.
Basically my `legal-will.txt` and a `where-is-the-seed.txt` files are both clear-signed with my PGP key and are replicated in separate geographic locations.

Because of KYC and AML (please google them before asking what they are).  Governments put up a firewall between fiat money (google it) and BTC in the form of KYC and AML.  This means anytime you want to convert fiat to BTC (what we call a "buy") there are mountains of government paperwork to fill out.  There are sites that fly under the radar of this, but they charge and arm and a leg because of the huge risk they take working on the edge of what is "legally" allowed.
If you live in a free society seriously consider your political voice and question whether this level of government intrusion into private commerce is really what you feel a free society should look like.  In the US political spectrum the desire to dis-entangle government corruption from private enterprise generally falls under r/Libertarian, though the movement has the same flaws as most political movements.

If that is the case, here's how you call the [cops on coinbase](  As I mention in the old post, you need to be a registered voter and bribe your congressman with some minor $20 "campaign contribution".  If you can make up a story about a sick grandmother when you visit the politician it will speed things along.
Expect about a 3 month wait before the regulators engage.  Once they do expect another 3 months before coinbase replies.

Not really "next" generation, but here's something I kick around every few weeks.  I just copied from my last mention of it.
Preloaded Blockchain SD / uSD cards.
* Get a batch of a dozen generic 512 GB SD cards from china for about &lt; $120
* Copy the entire Bitcoin mainnet, and Testnet blockchain
* Throw on some [par2]( recovery files to tolerate 20% (or more) failure on sectors
* Sell them for ~ $20 each
Obviously $9 SD cards at that capacity will be crap, but with parchive an astonishingly high number of sector failures are survivable.  Block data is automatically checksum'd so there's no risk of getting any malware on it.  I figure $20 might be worth it for some folks to not have to do the download, or buy a new SSD for bitcoin-qt.
Not convinced there is enough of a market to go through the trouble of investing $100 and some hours into the idea, but others might want to take it up.

Well ***technically*** yes, but in all practicality, no.  There are some utilities and scripts that will generate a timelock address that you can stuff BTC into, but there are no wallets that can spend those addresses yet.  There is a PR to add this to Bitcoin-Core, Electrum, Trezor and many others... but it's not there as of the time of this post.
So your timelock is of two levels
1. The redeem script has cool timelock code in it making it unspendable until a certain date.
2. Even if the date passes, there may not be any wallet that can spend that address.

Well, most "phrase" driven bitcoin wallets use a standard called BIP39.  It has a very specific dictionary of 2048 words.  If your just trying to generate your own "enthropy" (random number) and turn that into a passphrase, then yes, [Ian's tool]( will do that.
Keep in mind, there are plenty of people who have already generated many seeds from common numbers.  So if you try to encode your favorite music quote to a bitcoin wallet thinking your clever, someone has already done that.  As soon as you put funds into a "guessed" wallet it will be emptied.

TLDR; It appears it was a MITM attack.  Only way to prevent it would have been for LBC to publish and update thier SSL certificate hash/thumbprint (and other key fields) on places like Reddit and Twitter regularly.
ProtonMail does this, and I (for one) examine the SSL cert particulars when logging into BTC sites.  There are also DNS/DNSSEC records that can be useful.  This is what Trezor does.
Until then, I'd suggest looking at [Certificate Transparency]( and specifically at sites like [crt.sh]( (and others, this is not an endorsement) to verify your copy of the cert is the same as other "last checked" copies of the cert.  Get insanely suspicious if your cert cycled recently, or significantly before it's published expiration date.

Fuck that.  I'd prefer to see it go the other way.  If government tender is legal tender, then employers should be [required to provide it]( to employees upon request.  This has support in case law.  Companies used to pay workers in "[company notes]( that were a quasi-currency.  Laws were passed in the 20s to making this illegal, but now companies skirt the law by offering promissory notes for legal tender.  Not "company notes" but just as worthless to Mr. Asshole.


They've been doing that since the 60s.


Mr Asshole was just a strawman.  Everyone can say "screw Mr Asshole" and feel superiority about it.  But the process is no different than a bank refusing service to a unmarried mother because they disagree with her "sinful" life.  Or an athiest because of their "ungodlyness". All are examples of a bank exercising their speech in a way that is legal in the US.  But kicking a mother and child to the curb feels less "morally superior".

Thanks for the feedback guys.  I suppose I didn't really phrase my question right, so I guess that's why it missed its mark.  I'm coming at it from an OPSEC view point, so from that standpoint here is my view:
 Assumptions
1. Anything with an open port accepting bind connections (aka web-server) has a risk of getting completely compromised by an attacker.
2. Something with no open ports but still online (aka LN wallet without inbound conns) has a lower risk of getting completely compromised by an attacker.
3. If an attacker can compromise the security of the OS, it is assumed the risk of the wallets keys being compromised is &gt; 0.000000%
4. If an attacker compromises the wallet private keys, they will have access to whatever funds are in the wallet both past and future.
 Conclusion
Given that the a BTCPay server with LN enabled keeps an open internet port to service payment requests and keeps private keys on the server, the risk of [4] above is basically the odds of [1] times the odds of [3], both of which are &gt; 0.00000%.  So if you are at a non-zero risk of loosing previous and future payments, the rational thing to do (in my opinion) is to move funds out of the at-risk wallet.  This would mean that from the point in time `T` of point 4, the only funds at risk would be future payments, and not past ones.  Furthermore any movement of funds would signal the compromise allowing the operator to shutdown the server.  So realistically the risk window would be drastically reduced.
 Proposal
Given that moving funds off of the at risk wallet reduces exposure, my proposal is to move funds (via LN) from the high-risk wallet to a lower-risk wallet.  Since they are LN TXNs the cost is serviceable.  Although the low-risk wallet still has a risk &gt; 0.000000%, it is still significantly lower risk than the BTCPay server since the low-risk wallet does not accept inbound connections.  There are likely dozens of protocol specific ways to get this done.  My suggestions was to house a collection of 1000 invoices on the BTCPay server with a 800 hour expiration.  This would allow the operator to refresh the invoice collection once a month and allow the BTCPay server a collection of invoices to use to move funds from the high-risk to low-risk wallet.
 Postscript
Hopefully that defines my concerns a bit more clearly.

True.  If a human generated the password/passphrase, then it's shit.  Only secure ones are done with RNG and long as fuck..
For 128 bit secure, you need 20 RNG characters or 12 RNG words.  
The minimum strength for a hundred year secure password would be 72 bits.  That would be 13 RNG characters or 7 RNG words.
Strength degrades exponentially over time.  So you need to upgrade strength regularly, or pick a ridiculously strong starting point.

Brute-forcing a 256 bit cypher is impossible, but finding a flaw in the design is much more common.  Dual_EC_DRBG failed due to a design fault, though some claimed it was intentionally hobbled.
The company that found the flaw in Dual_EC_DRBG (Certicom) invented secp256k1 which is the main piece that secures Bitcoin.  As long as no one finds a flaw in secp256k1, all is good.  But no EC algorithm is ***proveably*** sound.  They are all simply "sound as far as we know"
The protocol could take preventative measures and add a second signature algorithm.  It has been proposed before, but has never received traction.  Hopefully a new one will be deployed in the next 120 years.
If a flaw it's ever found, it is unlikely a fork could reach deployment concencous before UTXOs were mined.  It would have to be deployed before it was needed, not after.

If this is something you think about, Consider joining a local group of camping enthusiast.  We did this as a family when my kids were young just to make sure they knew how to build a camp fire, tie a knot, pitch a tent.  The usual stuff.  Right after about the 5th year of our annual summer camping trips, our area got hit with a hurricane.  My house was fine, but we were without power for two weeks.  You honestly can't imagine how hard it is to do stuff without power.  Luckily I could get in and out of my neighborhood and my office opened the top few floors even though the sub-floors were flooded.
First thing my family did when power went out was to pull out all the camping gear.  We had tents set up in the backyard (just for grins) and had all our outdoor cookware lined up near the barbecue pit.  You could walk down my street and tell very quickly which families camped regularly and which didn't.
But yea.  If some solar cosmic flair EMPs all the power on planet earth, bitcoin is gonna be the least of your worries.  It will stay just where you left it, but there will be no way to use it to transact.

1. If he moved 10 billion to an exchange they would immediately lock his account.
2. If the admins were asleep and let him gobble 10 billion off the sell book, that market would almost certainly close.
3. The exchange that happened on would crash.
4. Whatever country that exchange was in would have MIB kicking down thier doors 5 minutes after all this begins.
Point is, there is no way to "surprise" an exchange and walk out with 10 billion in Fiat.  No exchange has that type of imbalance in liquidity.

If you reused an address yesterday the public key has been exposed for a day.  If you reused an address 8 years ago, the public key has been exposed for 8 years.  If you never reuse and address, the a public key is exposed for 10 minutes while you spend the funds the first and only time.
Reuse means to send funds to an address that has been spent at least once before.  It does not mean sending funds to the same address that has never been spent before.

On a 24 word seed you can gap enough of the seed in a 2o3 scheme to make brute forcing difficult.  On a 12 word seed, unless you use a formal SSS implementation, most 2o3 gaps could be brute-forced.

Yep... or simply tell people to stop reusing addresses.  The imaginary future QC attack is a factoring attack.  It requires the public key.  The public key is only exposed when a TXN enters the mempool or when an address is reused.  If you don't reuse addresses, the magical future QC would have to perform &lt; 10 minute factoring of secp256k1.  Literally hundreds of years away (if ever).
In that magical future fantasy land where 10-min factoring of secp256k1 has a 1:1,000,000 chance of success, the bitcoin protocol simply soft forks a new crazy long key like secp8096k1 and we are good for another million years.  The sigs for the new key would be 16x larger, so 4x more expensive, so that might be a good time to look at block size as well.

No, you are not.  This leaves you with 2 choices and one requirement.  The requirement is that you have a radically-open source HW and SW stack running on your HW wallet.  The two choices either of:
1. You learn HW and SW enough to review each line of code / schematic to determine if the HW / SW is legit.
2. You trust that with a large enough user base enough smart people would audit the HW / SW and voice any concerns if found.
I'm about 60%  and 40%   I've reviewed enough of the source to be "fairly" satisfied, but unless I do SHA hashes by hand, at some point, I'll have to "trust" an EC or SHA library at some point.

Well you can't protect the mempool.  Once a P2PKH or P2WPKH TXN enters the mempool, the public keys are clearly visible exposing the UTXO until it is in a block.


***HELL NO***.  Satoshi and Hal knew from day one that eventually, dozens (100s, 1000s) of years from now that secp256k1 may be vulnerable.  They discussed implementing other ciphers and concluded that it would be simple enough to do and deferred it to later.  So yeah.  If Hal or Satoshi's family want to retain their coins for the next 1000 years, then now would be a good time for them to move them.  
Otherwise let them stand.  It is a giant brass ring for the first QC miner to get enough qbits together.  Can't think of a better grand prize.

Nice find.  BTW, once one bitcoin is worth 1 million USD, it will represent ~ 2% of all global "money"
1. At 1 million USD / BTC, final BTC supply = 1.75% of global "money"
1. At 5 million USD / BTC, final BTC supply = 8.75% of global "money"
1. At 20 million USD / BTC, final BTC supply = 35.0% of global "money"
1. At 50 million USD / BTC, final BTC supply = 87.5% of global "money"
So once you hit 10^7 BTC will be pretty close to replacing all global "money" and the "exchange rate" becomes irrelevant.  At 10^7 a US dime buys you one satoshi and a gallon of milk will cost you about 50 satoshi.  I think once we get to 10^7 the collapse of fiat would be pretty much guaranteed.

Yes, you can import private keys into core.  Look on the bitcoin wiki for private key formats.  You should be able to simply look at your key and count digits to determine if it is truly a "WIF" format key.  This is the kind core expects.
If it is a BIP39 key (series of seemingly random words) then core won't help.

They will start mining brainwallets and UTXOs once the block reward vanishes.  Plenty of brainwallets and 64bit HD wallets have minable UTXOs today.  Jaxx used 9 word seeds for a very long time.
Similar mining has already happened back when RNG enthropy was less "random" on mobile.
Eventually something like Dual_EC_DRBG will happen to secp256k1 making many previously secured UTXOs minable.   The blind faith in Certicom is a bit misplaced in my opinion.

Yes, but if you have 5 different signing algorithms, it's less likely that they will all fail together.  If one fails, users can just move funds to a new address.  Much harder if they have to wait months for a soft-fork to roll out.
@_date: 2019-09-21 18:31:29


Tor is not about the darknet, the darknet is about Tor.  Have your logical implications backwards.
Bitcoin exposes your IP address when you spend.  The same transaction has the receiving address in it.  If you buy a guitar for bitcoin, anyone in the world will know that that guitar was bought by the person living in your house (or at least your city).  It's called IP geo-location.  Its a real thing.
Tor bounces traffic around so no one knows where it is from.
I agree you don't need it.  But you did mention "anonymity" in your post.
@_date: 2019-09-15 01:13:42


Yeah, the QC stuff is pretty unlikely, but I think something similar to Dual_EC_DRBG is much more likely.  People went to sleep one day and the curve was secure.  They wake up the next day and the curve is total crap.  I kinda think the blind faith in Certicom is a bit misplaced.
In any case, it would be simpler to state that the way consensus process happens for forks is problematic.  If something similar to Dual_EC_DRBG were to happen to secp256k1, I don't think a fork could reach consensus quickly enough to be effective.
Although 51% is required to co-op the network and force a blockchain fork, soft-forks have traditionally required signalling.  The BIP66 failure is a good example of how wrong things can go even when 95% of the hashing power think that they agree.
I definitely think there needs to be more options in the hashing and signing algorithms.  By the time diversity is required in these, it will likely be too late to realistically get a soft-fork deployed.

My favorite tin-foil hat to wear.  A QC reduction of the solve time for secp256k1 is a long way out.  Even if a QC could start chipping away at it, its going to take a long time to get the solve-time down to something like millions of years.  Might be worth mining something with million year solve times since its basically a 1:1,000,000 chance you mine a UTXO.
Honestly though, all that needs to happen is for a soft-fork with a new (ridiculously large) signing algorithm to be deployed.  Then once the wallets are deployed with the new QC-Resistant (QCR) addresses, you just move your legacy-UTXOs over to QCR-UTXOs.
Biggest bottleneck is the amount of time it takes to agree on a fork, merge it, deploy it, and have wallets and miners adopt it.  Something as small as a 2 year lead time would still be plenty of time if the effort was focused.
PS: If any physicist out there might speak to how QC effects [Landauer's Principle]( as it seems to be the limiting factor as to what an infinitely powerful piece of conventional HW could achieve.  Basically to make a IC that could brute force secp256k1 would require all energy of a the stars in the milky way to do it.

A Quantum Compute (QC) capable data center comes online much faster than anyone expects.  A fork is proposed for a new QC resistant signing algorithm, but requires a high consensus to activate.  A QC team colludes with the top five mining outfits to stall consensus and delay the fork.  As the fork stalls, the QC consortium mines lost UTXOs getting some of Satoshi's and Hal's lost keys.  Once the consortium hits a certain threshold, they broadcast spend TXNs of lost coins causing a 20x flash crash.
By the time it is all over, the consortium make off with 20 billion in Bitcoin.  The event forever stains the protocol.  Regardless of what changes are put in place it never returns to it's former glory.  It dies over the next five years following the QC consortium events.

Exactly.  Assuming we make it to the year 2140, coinbase rewards will eventually stop.  Since Bitcoin is discrete, we will eventually arrive at an indivisible amount.  So assuming, for example, a annual 10% loss rate, then we will reach the last satoshi somewhere around the year 2380.  We will be down to the last bitcoin (100 mil satoshis) around the year 2185.  At this point each of the 100 million remaining satoshis will be worth $2000.  Then every 7 years after that the value of a satoshi will double.  By the year 2250, each satoshi will be worth a million dollars.
At some point you have to ask yourself.  How many people are going to be dumb enough to lose a million dollar asset?  Certainly some people will, but that level will rapidly decrese when each satoshi becomes worth a billion dollars.  At this point there are so few left that most are owned by world governments to stabilize their fiat.

In some magical future QC reality, how long do you think the following will take?
1. Roll out a PR to bitcoin github repo to replace secp256k1 with a QC resistant cipher ( ___ many months )
2. Test verify and promote the PR to an official release of `bitcoind` ( ___ many months )
3. Time for consensus triggers to activate the new softfork ( ____ many months )
4. Time for HW / SW wallets like Electrum and Exchanges adopt the new address format ( ____ many months )
5. Time for all the existing P2PKH UTXOs to move their coins to a new QC resistant address ( ____ many months )
I think it would easily take 2 years to get 50% of addresses in [5] moved over to a new format.  I still have wallets / exchanges that don't support bech32.
Agreed that we are ***way*** more than 2 years away from a 10 minute solve of secp256k1 with QC, but I think the new address format deployment would take longer than most assume it would.

Auto-purchases with Coinbase cost 3.6% per TXN + fees.
Don't know how much Skrill cost.
My advice, do the following:
1. Get a Pro account.
2. Every morning set an alarm on your phone.
3. When the alarm goes off, log into pro and start an ACH of `X` many dollars from your bank to Pro
4. After [3] Check to see if you have any USD ready for buys in Pro
5. If you have USD, do a buy on Pro
For the first 21 days the money will be "in-flight" from BANK to CB.  After that every morning you start an ACH and every evening a previous one arrives.
Just saved you 3.45% (plus fees).

The risk of QC is a "factoring-risk" not a brute-force risk.  Single use bitcoin addresses only show their public keys for a few minutes.  Reused bitcoin addresses have their public keys exposed as long as the address is in reuse.
Satoshi's coins exposed their public keys since that was before public key hashing came into use.  So yes, satoshi's coins could be targeted by a QC (if one magically existed), but not yours.  Not unless you are reusing addresses.

2. Go to your bank and tell them your buying a car and need them to verify currency.
3. Ensure seller moves coins to a 2 of 2 multisig or trusted escrow account before trading money.
4. When satisfied take the seller to the teller and ask for $6000 in new $100 bills.

Nobody thinks that ` price tracks `pro.coinbase.com` price.  They charge less on Pro because they don't offer credit.  The retail side offers "instant buy".  You may think coinbase has your money but there is huge risk of charge-backs and bank-transfer reversals.  They charge you for that risk they aquire, which is why the retail side has unfair pricing compared to Pro.
Most people avoid Pro because they want the "instant-buy" capabilities.  But you don't get something for nothing.

To send bitcoin without any third parties.
1. Get a mining operation up and running
2. Download and build a full node
3. Get your counter-party to get a mining operation up and running
4. Get your counter-party to build a full node
5. Connect your node to your counter-parties node.
6. Send a TXN to your counter-party for them to validate.
7. Ensure your node and your counter-parties node agree that the TXN is valid.
8. Race with your counter party to add the TXN into a new block.
9. First one to mine the block gets the reward.
Sounds ridiculous now, but honestly that is how bitcoin worked for the first few years.  The only software was the "full-node" software, and all full-nodes were also miners.
@_date: 2019-09-17 19:03:29


1. Spec a change to include SHA512 (and likely new ECDSA algo)
2. Add PR to serve as reference implementation
3. Wait for miners to to agree on the fork
4. Wait for wallets to implement the fork
5. Users would move their UTXOs to new addresses
6. Lost UTXOs would be exposed to QC once it comes online
Only danger would be if 1-5 drags on too long (years).  As long as the fork happens ***before*** it is absolutely necessary, no problem.  From what I've read, we are about 40 years out.  So as long as they start thinking about a fork by 2050 we should be fine.

1. Closing or denying a mortgage due to ethnicity (race).
2. Closing or denying a mortgage due to religion.
Note that doing so based on gender, or orientation is "legal" but a real shit thing to do.  More over closing a non-mortgage account based on religion is legal as well... but also a real shit thing to do.
Some states and cities in the US have protections based on gender and orientation, but they don't exist yet federally.

SSL (you know the https stuff) originally used 3DES as its cipher.  3DES could be brute-forced in as little as 56 hours back in 1999, so it was eventually abandoned.
Yet... despite that fact that one of the ciphers used by SSL was cracked, SSL is still in wide use today.  Now days SSL supports dozens of ciphers and you can choose among them depending on your preferences on size, speed, and efficiency.
Somewhere in the next 25 years, bitcoin will will have the same type of selection.  There will be many different ciphers to choose from and people will shop wallets to find the one that offers the features they want.
Cyptography evolves.  As recently as 1500 years ago, ROT13 was considered a complex cipher.  Now its laughable.  I have no doubt that in 1500 years people will giggle at the realization that we thought secp256k1 would last till the end of time.

[My reply]( in the other thread.
Cryptography is not a static art.  It changes over time, just in leaps instead of slow progressions.  As recently as 1500 years ago, ROT13 was considered state of the art.  As recently as 30 years ago RSA512 was considered secure.  Both are laughably simple by today's standards.
The belief that sec256k1 could be broken in the next 1500 years is not a "bug".  They have been talking about extending the ciphers for bitcoin since 2010.  All they would have to do is add opcodes and define a new signing algorithm.  The protocol is very extendable.
So yes... sometime in the next 1500 years I fully expect there to be a fork.  Not really "news" though.

Well... Here's my [most recent response](
) as well as the [one before](

).  Basically u/Manticlops nailed it.  Stop reusing addresses if this really worries you.
Works something like this.  In some imaginary future, QC will be able to reduce the factor time for ECC curves from ... well... forever, to something more like a billion or trillion years.  Once solve times get down to a realm before our sun goes nova, then yes, someone could dedicated the next million years to stealing your bitcoin.
Now once someone is targeted, then they have to perform the factoring.  To do this, they need your public key, which they only get if you have funds stored in an addresses that has already been spent once (reused).  Without the public key to start the factoring the QC would have to brute-force SHA256/RIPE160 to find your either of your keys.  QC don't get any "advantage" when brute forcing SHA256/RIPE160, so that step would take them beyond our suns nova, so no problem there.

Yes it is BS, those are two different hacks that have been conflated together.  Jochen's hack has been patched for ages now.  In most configs the seed data never touches the USB for the very reasons that Jochen points out.
Donjon's (Ledger) required over 100k in gear, clean rooms, and delaminating of the IC.  Not to mention a half dozen PhDs in EE.  None of it had anything to do with the USB.  Its required possession and disassembly (desoldering) a Trezor.  Given that the only people confirming Donjon's findings work for Ledger, there is a clear conflict of interest.  Donjon is a real Jedi, and not to be messed with, but its a stretch to think that your average script-kiddie will be able to pull this off.
Neither of the two are "unpatchable".  Jochen's disclosure is already fixed and Donjon's non-disclosure [is already being addressed](
Contrary to a deficit of FOSS, I think Jochen and Donjon's write-ups show the biggest strength of FOSS.  But that is me.  Luckily there are choices in the market and each can make their own choice.

Electrum always chooses a server, either randomly or by choice.  What you need to "in-house" electrum is to run a full node ***AND*** an ElectrumX server.  Then you can connect as follows: my_Electrum-&gt;my_ElectrumX-&gt;my_bitcoind


Both can be run through Electrum or connect to the full-node directly via HWI.  Solve Electrum and you solve Trezor/Ledger "for free"


Well the companies would know that you have a device, but wouldn't be able to know what coins belong to you.  You   would always generate a new seed with the device.  You can even create your own enthropy with cards or dice if you want.


Ledger claims that they can tear apart a Trezor and get the keys out, but have promised not to tell anyone how.

Looking at the sentinal code, it looks like they have shut down sentinal.  No commits or updates for 9 months.

Scope of "Information Technology Security" beyond that which could be banged out in a reddit or blog post.  If your interested there are some good books on the subject.  Regardless of the source, anything less than 20-30 hours of material would likely be superficial at best.
There are some good degree paths and certification paths on it, but that is likely overkill if your goal is "don't get your bitcoin stolen".  As far as the "most minimum" amount of information, I'd suggest:
1. Learn what SSL is and how to use it.
2. Learn what signed publishers are in software and how to check it.
3. Learn what PGP/GPG is and how to use it.
4. Get a HW wallet

Ohh... well, that depends.  I assume your in EU.  Most US banks won't allow BTC with credit, only debit, ACH or wire.
There are services like paxful and purse that will disguise the charge so that most banks let it through, but these can run north of 8% in fees or more.  Way above my pain threshold.
In the off chance that your in the US and you used the term "CC" simply to refer to that little plastic card attached to your bank, consider using an ACH or FedWire connected to an exchange instead.  Much more reliable since the banks are less likely to deny the TXN

 Shamir
1. Use [Shamir's method]( to split your seed into 2 of 3
2. Send one via encrypted email (proton mail)
3. Send one to your destination via postal mail.
4. Carry one on your person as you travel.
5. Ensure you don't have the encrypted mail on your phone.
5. Wipe your Trezor before you embark and reload it when you arive.
 Order / Content split
1. Take a 24 word seed and scramble the order.
2. Make a de-scrambler key that has the proper order {12, 18, 5, 1, 8... }.
3. Take the scrambled key on your person as you travel.
2. Send the order de-scrambler via encrypted email (proton mail).
2. Send the order de-scrambler via postal mail to your destination.
5. Ensure you don't have the encrypted mail on your phone.
5. Wipe your Trezor before you embark and reload it when you arive.

Please elaborate... I'd been looking for source material on this.
If your talking about SegWit fork, I'd disagree with any assessment that this was quick and expedient.  If QC-Resistant-address capable wallets take as long to deploy as Bech32 wallets have taken, I think we are all doomed.  Its precisely why I'd like to see some movement on this at least 10 years before it is needed.
Also consider a "fast-fork", if QC was eminent, where blocks just signal "v4" or something.  There would be an absolute frenzy to move UTXOs to the new QCR-addresses.  Talk about flooding the mempool.  This would be of biblical proportions.

4. Quantum Computing.  Some new QC breakthrough that makes secp256k1 crack-able in in less than 1000 years. 
5. Secp256k1 Bug.  Some PhD finds a flaw in secp256k1, or a method to significantly weaken it
# Mitigations
1. Evade the government.  Worked for Vietnam War draftees.
2. Move to Tor or other "alternative" network protocols / layers.
3. Ignore 'em.
4. Hope that bitcoin core developers release a Quantum hardened signature algorithm in the next 100 years.

Spot on. 


There are still poor sobs that have coins sitting in reused addresses.  Obviously they are idiots, but they are also at risk in a magical future time where QC happens.
One factor left out is the block-time exposure of public keys.  QC maximalists will argue that in the next 1000 years a QC will come on line that can crack secp256k1 in under 10 minutes.  This would allow the QC to crack TXNs as they sit in the mempool.  It's hard to say if QC will have a exponential growth (aka Moore's Law) but it is very unlikely that 10 minute cracks of secp256k1 will happen before we are all dead an buried.
Also, really old UTXOs used P2PK not P2PKH.  So those ***really old*** UTXOs will actually serve as a canary.  As soon as Satoshi's or Hal's P2PK-UTXOs move, we will know a QC has come on line that needs to be taken seriously.  Until then STFU.

* [P2P exchanges (e.g., LocalBitcoins, Bisq, HodlHodl, Paxful, etc.,)](
* [Purse.io/earn]( (shop Amazon for BTC, must be 13yo).
* [Mmycelium Local Trader](
* [Meetup.com - Bitcoin]( or any meetup you can find.  Ask (discretely) to buy BTC for cash after the meeting.
* Buy altcoin then [convert to Bitcoin](  Different coins have different P2P buy options.
* Craigslist sell for Bitcoin (double the price and offer 50% off if paid with Bitcoin)
* Mining &lt;= Super crazy risky unless your a savaont, makeing a profit is hard.
* Work for crypto (mow lawns and offer 50% off if they pay with Bitcoin).
Please remember that the whole reason bitcoin is only for adults is that it is easy to steal.  If you proceed there is a 100% chance that someone ***will*** try to scam you.  Make sure you catch every scammer you encounter, or you will go broke fast.

It tracks back to segwit and LN.  One faction "red" wanted to deploy segiwt and LN.  Another faction "blue" opposed segwit and LN and suggested just increasing the blocksize without them.  Red-v-Blue ensues in a normal manner.  Red is what we call "Bitcoin", Blue is what we call "Bitcoin Cash"
During the Red-v-Blue crypto wars, both claimed to be "The True Bitcoin".  In standard "Capture the Flag" rules, here's where it stands:
 Bases that Team Red holds (Bitcoin)
* `bitcointalk.org`
* `bitcoin.org`
* r/Bitcoin
* 95% of the post-fork hashing power.
* Higher Market Cap
 Bases that team Blue holds (Bitcoin Cash)
* `bitcoin.com`
* r/btc
* 5% of the post-fork hashing power.
* Smaller Market Cap
* Cheaper on-chain TXN costs

To answer your question with a question.... Jump in a time machine and warp back to 1940


In 1940 you could buy a gallon of milk (on sale) for a quarter.  Even if the "value" of bitcoin remains constant, 2% inflation will make a 2019 $8000 bitcoin worth $100,000 by 2146.  BTW that gallon of milk will cost $640 by then.
If you believe that a gallon of milk will never cost $500, then it explains why you can't believe BTC will ever be worth $100,000

Keep in mind... Legal or Not, many ISPs (Comcast for example) prohibit offering up network services (which a full node would supply) from your residence.
I checked AT&amp;T's TOS and they have a carve-out on equipment that is scary


AT&amp;T seams to imply they implicitly have Admin rights to all "equipment" that connects to their network.  Clearly an overreach that needs to be clarified, but there it is.
As for Comcast, they simply forbid network "services" that serve anyone off-premise.


content or any other services to anyone outside of your Premises local area network (“Premises
LAN”), also commonly referred to as public services or servers. Examples of prohibited
equipment and servers include, but are not limited to, email, web hosting, file sharing, and proxy
services and servers
Technically, P2P is prohibited in the Comcast TOS, or at least by my reading.  I realize that Comcast with deny this tooth and nail, but if they ever want to exercise the prohibition, it is clearly spelled out in their TOS
My recommendation is to file a complaint with the FCC to bring up your issue as well as any overreach they spell out in the AUP or TOS.
As for me... I simply subscribed to a VPN.  That gives me both privacy (to a degree) and flexibility to open or close whatever ports I want.

It is, but should it be?  Bare with me here.  Under what conditions (in the US) is access to the federal banking system a right of the people.  Imagine the worlds worst person alive, but strip them of any criminality.  Just a real ass with the worst possible ideology.  Now take the "right to refuse service" to the Nth degree.
1. 100% rejected by all US banks.
2. Unable to get a house because the title companies refuse service.
3. Unable to rent because Fair Housing Act only addresses protected classes.
4. Unable to get on payroll since Mr. Asshole can't cash payroll checks.
At what point (if ever) should access to market economies be guaranteed?
I support your view as a free-speech absolutist, but am sympathetic to the thought our interconnected world may be tantamount to "death by speech".  Similar to the historical Pariah class of ancient India who were unable to ever enter the Indian economy and were always subjugated to either begging starving to death.

Address reuse is a privacy issue.  But sending to an address you previously spent from is a security issue.  It opens your keys up to a K-value attack.

Stop investing money and try to fix your marriage.  Put whatever you have left in a savings account and stop looking for the next million dollar investment.  A divorce will cost you far more money than you could ever make investing.

Good time to remember your basic OPSEC.
1. Only go to the site presented on the Trezor HW display (`trezor.io`).
2. Compare SSL certs you get on your browser with CT logs (`crt.sh`).
3. Verify DNS resolution with DNSSEC (`dnsviz.net`).
4. Check sites page rank on some reputable site (`alexa.com`), phishing sites will rank low.
5. Never perform seed related action on the Trezor without being prompted by the Trezor HW first.
