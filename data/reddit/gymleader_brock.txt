I think Jimmy wales hinted that through human computer interaction studies they have data that suggests that more options at checkout leads to higher cart abandonment rates.
You might also consider that some individuals might even make it a point by not spending their money at that place if they accept bitcoins. Either because of ignorance OR bitcoin is a threat to their livelihood.

Wrong, shitlord. That's not how the exchange works. The current price of bitcoin is based on matching a person who is willing to pay a certain price with a person that is willing to sell at a certain price.

I guess I'm not as concerned as everyone else because I don't leave my BTC at the exchange. If I have some at btc-e and they close down during that time the money I would have put there for day trading was expendable anyway. This is not a problem for me.

* Earn any amount of bitcoin.

* Not earn any amount of bitcoin.

I guess it's time I apply given that it's a serious organization that has serious consequences and serious initiatives that are serious instead of being just a group of dudes who like bitcoin and ask for money from people. For the record, when I see "Foundation member" on a business website, it makes me lose faith in the intelligence of that business knowing they gave money to it. On other note, where do I donate directly to the developers instead of the political bureaucratic bullshit that we're trying to go around with bitcoin?
