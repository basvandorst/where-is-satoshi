But wait, you had 400 in cash. So even with Bitcoin you cannot send the cash itself because first you would have to exchange it for Bitcoin somehow. This would assume that the other person (the nice old lady) accepts Bitcoins, which would mean the person is very likely to have some form of bank account. But if the person has a bank account you could also simple make an online transfer. Of course, that would not be newsworthy in the first place ...
Just to be clear: I think Bitcoin serves an important purpose, but this is a bad example of its usefulness ...

"Be your own bank" works for advanced users (which are most of the users here). The average user is simply not tech savvy enough and should not be entrusted to take care of things like private keys, paper wallets and backups IMHO. In the optimal case you would not need a service like Coinkite, I agree, but in reality people forget passwords, do not make backups and do not know nearly enough about security and for those people you will have services like Coinkite. Everyone else can still be their own bank.

I am curious, why do you think support for Litecoin makes Coinkite less appealing?

That's why I love technical analysis. It can mean whatever you want it to mean. 
(Btw I hope your post was meant as a joke in the first place ...)

Could you please elaborate on your last point? Currencies are normally swapped x for y. Are you saying ripple suggests to swap x for ripple for y? I am sorry but I don't see the point in this.

Have an account on Coinkite since about 2 weeks. I like the idea of the debit card and transferred some Bitcoins and Litecoins there and pay for the mid term plan to support the business model. I talked to them via support tickets because I wanted to know more about their security procedures and they always responded quickly and to the point: 
Their pricing model is a bit confusing. You can create a free account and keep it free but pay something like 2.4 percent for every withdrawal. Withdrawal via debit card will be free. First withdrawal is for free so you can transfer coins there and if you don't like it withdraw them again without incurring any costs. They always pay the transaction fee for you. Overall, the service might be a bit pricey now, personally I see it as an investment into an interesting idea (Bitcoin debit cards, in the future maybe insurance against coin theft) and just like to have an online wallet for Bitcoin and Litecoin all in one service.
Just to be clear: so far I only put a small percentage of my coins there to have them available at all times (rest in paper wallets) and used it to pay some things. Once Coinkite becomes more mature and has a track record I will consider putting more coins there.
