OP probably went all in in December, and needs to post such nonsense to build hope that one day he'll breakeven

90% shit....How much did you invest?
@_date: 2018-08-17 23:35:15
$1000 by Christmas 
@_date: 2018-06-27 22:52:54
Uh huh sure
@_date: 2018-11-24 21:52:37
Do you really think btc will ever be worth 18000 times more than a dollar? I think a 10 to 20 time multiplier is fair value.
@_date: 2018-02-03 06:48:37
That's for sure..
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:59:12
You still think it's going to hit $18k
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:02:09
Ouch I wanted in but stood by the side lines. Was ridiculed for doing that. Happy that i did now..when the media is telling you that something is doing well, think the opposite.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:19:50
They did already.
@_date: 2018-02-02 22:04:22
I have only learnt one thing in investing. That is when the media is talking about how great or how hot a position is doing, then it's time to bail. So many suckers fell for the December bitcoin media blitz 
@_date: 2018-02-02 23:56:22
Much better chance it going down to $5000, than it going back to $18k 
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:21:21
Buddy I don't wanna make you any poorer. Concentrate on the fact the btc is at $7660. :)
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:20:36
Simple...the hype is gone.
@_date: 2018-02-03 00:12:46
I don't  think it's very unlikely that bitcoin holders will ever again see the kind of outsized gains enjoyed by people who bought bitcoins prior to 2017. Bitcoin is now a good-sized financial asset. There isn't much room for it to get dramatically bigger.

An emotional investor, who's probably way in the red, and who purchased in mid December 
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:39:51
How many of you are still holding on to $18k bitcoins?
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:33:30
Hmm what I see is a 450% gain in price  is needed in order for many of you just to break even. Not going to happen the crypto craze is gone.
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:33:11
Ouch $3,393 
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:01:48
Too many of you are emotionally attached, and this has clouded your judgement imo.
BTC has been sinking like a rock for the past 11 months. I don't understand the hold logic. 
What am I missing here?
