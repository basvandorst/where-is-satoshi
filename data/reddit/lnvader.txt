This will be just like gox, except squared, on steroids, drenched in oil, and wrapped in nuclear waste. BTC could authentically get sent back into triple digits in one day.

It was done automatically by airbitz. As soon as the transaction was sent the mempool exploded with TXs. Over 27k and counting for the first time in a week. How unlucky can I get lmao

They should know who I am considering they tweeted my username and picked my tweet as the winner. I think they're trying to get out of giving me my winnings.

I've already contacted them through their support. I haven't received a response in 36 hours.

There simply aren't enough people who are familiar with technology in Greece for this to happen. The majority of the population are either old and have never used a computer or are immigrants from the 3rd world. They wouldn't trust a digital currency because they can't understand the tech behind it. A study I read showed that almost 80% of people in Greece had never used a computer, so how would you go about distributing a digital currency?

LBJ's mistakes are still felt today. All the dysfunction in the black community started with his "war on poverty". This policy ended up destroying the black family, ending with the incarceration of a huge portion of the black population.

Ignoring them will do nothing. They won't stop. They'll turn bitcoin into occupy wall street v2. THIS is the future we chose if we don't address this problem ASAP.
