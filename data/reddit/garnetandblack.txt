You mean by the time I can type this. This is insane.

I don't feel like that's "tinfoil" since it could super easily happen. The only real unknown (for me) is how many players it'd take to make this  happen.

Yes, unable to for a week.

Question, is the default fee to move from Coinbase -&gt; Wallet something that should be adjusted? I wasn't even aware of the option. 
I have two pending transactions, neither of which I adjusted anything from the defaults, one has taken 18 hours, the other 12 hours.

Fairly unreal of you to do something like this. I work in medical research, specifically stroke prevention, utilizing high resolution MRI imaging to identify potential plaque features that may be predictors of an incoming stroke. We are trying to expand our efforts across the world, currently training and sharing our sequences and findings with multiple sites. 
Stroke prevention research is criminally underfunded, most dollars go to stroke recovery, which is just due to natural human tendencies in my opinion. Seeing a stroke happen, you want to fix it. Preventing one, most people think "oh eat better, exercise, you'll be fine" but fail to realize we could be SO much better at predicting  your chances of one, and stopping it in its tracks. 
Anyway, I have no idea how you could donate to this via bitcoin, but certainly will check your application page out and see if I can work with some administrators to start venturing into the acceptance of bitcoin as donations for what we do.
No matter what, awesome stuff man. Pineapples rock.

Is there a way to adjust the payment after it's been sent? In theory, could something be "in limbo" forever?

Maybe
