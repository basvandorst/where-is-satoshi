Bitcoin is better than fiat and gold.  Its down now and has problems, but its potential remains undiminished. With bitcoin no middle man is required, there is a mathematical inflation rate free of government meddling, there is a predetermined supply, its easy to move around across and within borders, its programmable money, etc . . .  In an ideal world I would prefer to transact and save in bitcoin and crypto compared to gold, the dollar, and other government issued fiat and increasingly more share this vision.   Crypto and bitcoin would be worth trillions if I were representative, and we are a growing demographic.

What is inherent value?  It seems to be more of  a subjective rather and objective notion.  Why should paintings worth hundreds of millions have value? To many, they could be just a canvas with some colors on them.  The "value" is that there is someone willing to pay a lot for them in the market.  Bitcoin is no different.

Bitcoin is a nation killer.  Leaders like Putin are now clamoring for nations to get together and issue a cryptocurrency, when Bitcoin is staring them straight in the face.

Banks have been proclaiming "Blockchain not Bitcoin" since 2015 and little has been done since then.   I think is that separating blockchain from bitcoin is impractical.

 Trace Meyer discusses 7 network effects that make Bitcoin the strongest cryptocurrency:
Bitcoin leads in each network effect; each effect by itself is powerful enough, but in conjunction make Bitcoin a serious force.
Compared to other altcoins, bitcoin has the strongest social media presence, strongest team of  developers and maintenance, strongest name recognition, strongest connections to the financial world, and a strong infrastructure with most off-ramp and on-ramps to fiat.
I am not fully confident that bitcoin will remain top dog in the future, however, so I would recommend diversifying. Other alt-coins are fighting hard to grow and position themselves and their scaling technology could arguably be more up-to-date than bitcoin, so bitcoin must not sleep in its laurels.

I do not see how the underlying price of an asset can be affected by other people making bets on it; only the owners and sellers of the assets have a say on the value. Perhaps someone can explain. 
However, futures can make institutions own more bitcoin because they provide a hedging tool (in case bitcoin price tanks). Also, it provides tools for manipulating the market (i.e. bet bitcoin will fall and then sell your bitcoin ).  So net effect is unclear to me, but hedging will make bitcoin more respectable so possible a big upside there.

I'll be honest with you. As much as I want it to succeed,  Bitcoin 'Core' is having problems scaling, it is slow and expensive and the lightning network is still a work in progress.  I am wondering whether the decision to limit the blocksize to 1 MB made by the developers will in the end have been the correct decision.

I don't understand these government cryptocurrencies; in all likelihood the network will be a centralized one.
They are all about command and control. Bitcoin has a mathematical inflation rate.  The gov. crypto won't have an upper ceiling, and the govt will reserve the right to alter the monetary supply.
Someone in the govt will soon realize that it would be a good idea to be able to freeze or flag addresses and accounts.  If you run afoul of them, they won't hesitate to do so.
Depending on their paranoia, they won't tolerate having nodes they cannot control, therefore the nodes will be controlled by the government directly or indirectly. And they won't take kindly to allowing expensive independent miners.  Much cheaper and convenient if they themselves get to update the ledger.  You don't want to hand your power and influence over to independent actors after all.

Cryptocurrencies were designed to give freedom and control to an individual without any meddling from third parties.  It is ironic that authoritarian governments, seeing the benefits of crypto, now want to join in in order to escape the control of other powers and govts.  However they are stuck between a rock and a hard place, as they want to escape the control of higher ups, but at the same time retain control of their slave citizens.  Thus mistakenly they think they can address this by issuing their own doomed to failure cryptos.  Give it up, adopt bitcoin as the reserve currency and acknowledge your well deserved loss of sovereignty.

Playing the "devil's advocate", I would say Bitcoin is fundamentally stable, its the dollar which is particularly unstable and generally depreciating against Bitcoin.

One can spend a lot of energy on an output which is not valued by others.  However, with bitcoin there is a base price which suppliers (miners) will not be willing to sell less than and that is the cost of production of a bitcoin.
Median cost of production for a bitcoin is likely in the $6.5K range as of December 2017.  During the bitcoin bear, the market exchange rate has been on par with the cost of production ( a little bit higher for profitability). One way to value a bitcoin could be the ratio of exchange rate to median cost of production. Right now this ratio is at an historical high; this suggests there is a lot of speculation/optimism.  If these expectations are not met, and they can change on a dime, it suggests  the cost of production will have to catch up with market price as hash rate increases for the price to be sustainable, or the market price will have to trend down to meet the cost of production. However, the long term trend of cost of production is constant increase which is a bullish sign.

Although it is possible bitcoin may be overvalued, I speculate that there are solid reasons besides a mania:
- bitcoin is a veblen/giffen good.  The more expensive a bitcoin is the more in demand it will become as you can transfer large amounts of money without any liquidity problems. Some use cases like small cash transactions have been left behind, but there is a potential to update bitcoin to recapture these use cases.
- the value of bitcoin may follow Metcalf's law, which is being used by some investors.  According to this law, bitcoin's value is proportional to the square number of users (or some other metric related to user demand).  Thus a sudden spikes in demand (number of users) will increase the value in a non-linear manner.
- many people are realizing that bitcoin is a superior or has the potential to be superior store-of-value and currency together or in combination than alternatives and thus have started to desire it. There is a growing community of strong believers that take this as a given, like me. 
- There is a limited supply of bitcoin; only 5 million are likely being offered in the market to meet the sudden interest. And current growth in circulating bitcoins seems to be limited due to the small inflation rate and the strong HODLER culture.   
- The future looks particularly bright to some of us. The crypto economy is developing and growing rapidly; the young generation are increasingly likely to hold and spend their wealth in bitcoin than older generation counterparts; financial markets are integrating bitcoin trading, making it a respectable asset/currency; and increasing institutional inflows are expected.  Furthermore threats seem to be receding.  In particular, I thought Chinese prohibitions would negatively affect bitcoin's value, but nothing happened.  Altcoins (and forks) are doing there best to dethrone bitcoin, but their threat has receded these days; ethereum seemed particularly close this june, but it came to nothing.  For me,  altcoins actually serve to multiply Bitcoin's value as it then becomes a reserve currency in this crypto trading space, and it is likely some use cases in this space motivated the current growth spurt (i.e. ICO emissions). 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:18:08
Unpopular, but there is a risk some other cryptotoken could take over eventually if Bitcoin fails to scale or takes too long to scale.  Some of these (i.e. Ethereum with the Raiden network) are scaling up pretty fast to handle large volume of transactions with lower fees and increased speed.

If you give money to others for safe-keeping, they will eventually try to appropriate it.

People could use bitcoin for their consumer activities instead of regular cash if bitcoin were more convenient to use, which it might in the future.   If they were paid in bitcoin they would not need to convert to fiat.
I do not think bitcoin's deflationary qualities detract it from becoming a replacement, in fact without government intervention and assuming it can scale properly, this quality would rather accelerate adoption.
What may be a problem for economists of the Keynesian type is that having a deflationary mainstream currency would potentially choke the economy and lead the world to an era or protracted growth. Since they are the dominant school of thought, it is likely the governments of the world will do anything to prevent this from happening and prevent bitcoin from taking over if they can. That and bitcoin's inability to eventually scale.

The way I see it, since bitcoin is deflationary, a saver may want to put some of his money into bitcoin as a hedge against inflation. The worse the inflation, the more bitcoin is attractive and valuable (see Venezuela, Zimbabwe, and Argentina for a preview).
On the other hand, some economist mentioned that bitcoin's value would fall if interest rates go up, which tends to happen if there is fiat inflation, as savers may find the interest more attractive I presume and invest in bonds instead of bitcoin.
These are counterbalancing effects, but net effect in my opinion is that bitcoin value should probably increase in inflationary settings.  Many conservative savers will be turned off by bitcoin's volatility though if inflation is tame , so inflation effect on bitcoin price may be muted if bitcoin is volatile.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:05:06
I was thinking if interest rate rose then this would be a symptom of inflation of the underlying fiat.  As bitcoin is deflationary, this would then increase its demand as investors move to store-of-value.  What do I know.

if you are in the US and US resident, the simplest route is to open an account in Coinbase; you can then buy bitcoin from your bank account.   Once you buy bitcoin,  you don't do nothing and wait, say 5 years.  After 5 years,  you then sell your bitcoin.  Chances are the price will be much higher than today, but could be much lower too.  There is no guarantee.  Remember to calculate you capital gains and pay taxes if you want to be compliant with the US government.
P.S. For ease of use, leave your bitcoin in Coinbase and forget about it.  To ward against hacking or other things, move your bitcoin to a hardware wallet instead.

Double check with others but I would say  Capital and income tax  apply if you are us citizen or resident alien on all wordwide income, which will be the case if you meet the substantial presence test; likely you will be if you live in the US, but you may be an exempt individual like a student with F-1 visa. So as a resident alien, you pay tax regardless of were you bought or sold the bitcoin.
If you are a non-resident alien who lives outside the US but has business/bank account in the US, then I am not sure on that.  It seems based on my reading that if you sell your bitcoin in an US exchange to your US based bank account then you have to pay capital gains regardless of were you bought your bitcoin. Don't quote me on this.

Multi-signature accounts could be an option.  You can access the account with your private key OR trusted custodian key + family members key.

Depends on your risk appetite and your faith in this technology. If you invest now, perhaps you could be doing so at the top, but if you are willing HODL then you may well see gains from your investment eventually.  Somebody who bought at the 2014 highs of 1200$ and hodled through the 60% crash,   would have earned a 10x return this year.   If you are risk averse, I would prefer to invest during plateau phases, even if they should be at prices higher than today's.

They cannot stop bitcoin itself, but they could make life of bitcoin holders miserable if they chose to; it is a distinct possibility in my opinion.  At some point, they will require them to report all their holdings complete with addresses etc . . . putting the burden of proof on them that they are not money launderers and tax evaders.  If you disclose, you will be viewed with suspicion by the government agencies, requiring paperwork, constant auditing, precautionary detainment, and other  major inconveniences.   You could choose not to comply and maintain secrecy, but in this case you will be going against the hypothetical future laws and subject to severe penalties if discovered.

Yes,  the guideline is that if bitcoin leaves your control (you exchange it for another crypto or USD), then when this happens this is a taxable event and you must report the event as well pay capital gains tax (or loss) to the IRS. 
I was wondering about  situations when you transfer bitcoin between addresses but the bitcoin is still in your control.  You do not owe taxes in this situation, but the question is whether you should report this event to the IRS.  According to what I have been able to gather, you do not need to report transfers to the IRS, but need to keep records in case of an audit.

For me there is a good chance that bitcoin will turn out to be very sustainable and very valuable.
I am specially optimistic about the altcoin scene. There are now many talented young developers and entrepeneurs who are fully engaged in building all types of services and technologies (i.e. decentralized storage, financial services, super computing, infrastructure, the list goes on).  I thinks it is unlikely this growing decentralized economy will fail to take off in the future; it would not surprise me if it eventually takes over many of the functions  provided by current corporations.  Bitcoin is currently the gateway and reserve currency of this new economy and as a reserve currency I believe its value should increase if this economy continues to grow and innovate. I am speaking of trillions of USD dollars in marketcap and we haven't seen anything yet.

I think layering design is the best, where each layer can have different characteristics of centralization, speed, and fees according to the users needs.  However, I am wondering if that inability to compromise with the 1mb limit will ultimately doom Bitcoin as it presents an opportunity for competitors to overtake it.  I would have been more adaptable and allow for blocksize increase as a temporary stopgap measure to alleviate congestion while the lightning network and other solutions are being devised and built, in addition to SegWit of course.  The core developers early on also seemed to be thinking along these lines but something happened and they became intransigent at 1mb.

High transaction fees, slow confirmation times, pricing out from the promising use cases bitcoin had, all this has been a downer for me and one reason for the pullback in my opinion.

Ok, so there are limitations, but as imperfect as it is now, bitcoin still can function well enough as store of value and currency (despite high transaction fees).
What he is forgetting is that these networks are: UPGRADEABLE.  New technologies are being developed and put in place which will increasing make bitcoin more efficient and cheaper to transact; volatility is also decreasing as bitcoin's value increases and the markets develop hedging tools for it.

To be honest, these security and intelligence organizations should be warm to Bitcoin because due to its pseudonymous nature, you can audit and follow transactions much better than physical cash.

My take as a lay bitcoiner:
-As both a form of currency and money, Bitcoin has significant advantages over fiat and gold (many comparisons charts on this).
-It cannot be censored. If only you know the password to your bitcoin, then nobody can confiscate or control it except you. No middle man is needed to transfer or control your Bitcoin.
-Unlike other forms of money, there is a limit to number of Bitcoins (21 million).  Yes, it is still possible altcoins are a form of dilution; but I think it still counts for something that the ceiling is fixed.
-The monetary inflation rate is known with certainty.
- Bitcoin is the oldest and biggest blockchain network, it has significant network effects protecting it against competition, and has survived so far through everything. 
- New tech is continuously being developed which looks like it may  solve Bitcoin's scaling problems, usability, and anonymity.
- Bitcoin is gearing up to be a reserve currency for the nascent crypto-economy, the internet, an perhaps the world as a natural extension.
- The Blockchain technology may be revolutionary at the level of invention of the printing press and Bitcoin seems inextricably linked to the blockchain and its success.
- Young generation seems to be leading developments and adoption of bitcoin and crypto.

When I first found about bitcoin, one of my first thoughts on wide acceptance was that the country that prohibits will lose a lot of wealth at the expense of the country that accepts it, so its either all or none. The US, China, and the other countries would thus have to prohibit simultaneously, it would require a coordinated effort by the United Nations. To prohibit it, bitcoin and crypto in general will have to demonized, worldwide media will have to paint it as the technology of terrorists, hackers, tax evaders, and the general scum of the earth.
After outlawing crypto, governments will be given carte blanche to pursue,discourage, jail, even torture anyone who is using bitcoin or possesses bitcoins (or crypto).  Bitcoin developers may be hunted down in a bid for decapitation strikes. if the governments are more enlightened, they will instead seek to coopt bitcoin, infiltrate it from within (i.e. controlling core), and then slyly sabotage it. Tax codes and policies will be written to be specially onerous and difficult on crypto. Bitcoin may end up something like a world currency pegged to a basket of national currencies; other crypto will be tolerated provided they have sufficient inflation and few anonymity features; victory over bitcoin will be achieved when they raise the 21M ceiling. I am praying for this to not happen. We will achieve victory once the majority of the senate and congress possess significant quantities of bitcoin.

The combined wealth of everybody in the world is:
241 trillion. ( If crypto and blockchain are a revolutionary and important trend as many of us imagine, then it is not out of the question 1% of that wealth will move into crypto: this would be 2.41 trillion.  Crypto is presently at 160 B so the potential for growth is still tremendous. Let us be even more optimistic, and imagine crypto at some point of time capturing up to 20% of the wealth of future generations. This would be 48.2 trillion.  It looks like bitcoin would capture a large chunk of this. We still could be very early in this story.

I agree with you about Bitcoin's problems with micro-transactions and that there are currently better coins for doing this.   The developers of bitcoin core are planning to address this deficiency with second layer solutions like the Lightning Network.  Taking a long time, but we'll see. 
Although current limitations in this front may detract from store-of-value reasons, other reason remains including the convenience for conducting larger peer to peer payments.  And the small payments issue may be addressed by including a middle-man bank again where you have a bitcoin account; it detracts from peer-to-peer vision and has its problems but seems like an alternative to me.

Maybe you won't get rich, but in the long run at worst you would hope to preserve the buying power of the $250 in case of a fiat hyperinflation catastrophe and future runaway inflation, so holding bitcoin would be a hedge.

What concerns in such scenario is the claim that governments many try to regulate bitcoin out of existence (i.e. Kenneth Rogoff's claim).  This would take the form of onerous taxes, stiff penalties,  increased surveillance and loss of privacy, red tape and restrictions; in more authoritarian governments this may take the form of outright prohibition, persecution, and demonization.  Bottom line is that they won't cede control of the monetary supply so easily.

I would like to believe that the more bitcoin's value increases the more its utility will be due to economies of scale. Wealthy Institutions and indiviuals can now move very large quantities of money (in the billions) with relative ease, serving to create a virtuous circle of increasing value as the network goes into more demand.
Under my most bullish interpretation, there is a positive feedback in terms of network effects that is being driven by an increasing consensus that bitcoin/crypto will be a mainstream store and transmission of value.   Such consensus is not based on hype, but a gradual realization that the network bitcoin's characteristics has many favorable advantages over gold and fiat as a form of money; in other words that this is technology that is inherently better to its competing counterpart, just as the electricity is to the candle, the automobile to horse buggys, and book printing is to scroll writing.
I also think this run-up was started by the ICO boom back in April, awakening interest in crypto and allowing for large inflows into the space.

With permission from Seeking Alpha and Caiman Valores the author: 
Considerable room for the bubble to expand
It is easy to see that there is still plenty of room for the Bitcoin bubble to grow and that the momentum behind cryptocurrencies is still in its early phase. Given that Bitcoin is now treated by some as a commodity and holds similar status to that of gold or silver in the eyes of many investors as both a currency and store of value, there is still considerable upside available.
You see, Bitcoin and other existing cryptocurrencies only have a combined market cap of $245 billion, which represents a mere fraction of the trillions of dollars invested in other alternate asset classes. A sense of the potential available can be seen when comparing that market cap to the value of other assets.
The estimated total value of all gold that exists globally comes to around $7.7 trillion or 31 times greater than the combined market cap of all cryptocurrencies that currently exist. Even if we exclude central bank gold reserves, the value of privately-held gold bullion in some quarters has been estimated to be $3.5 trillion, which is still a massive 14 times greater than cryptocurrencies' market cap.
Then you have all major fiat currencies globally, which are thought to have a value of roughly $7.6 trillion, which is an incredible 31 times the market-cap for cryptocurrencies. This is particularly important to note because of cryptocurrencies' growing role as currency because they would only need to receive a fraction of the acceptance of those fiat currencies to drive the value of Bitcoin and other digital currencies higher.
What this is telling investors is that there is still considerable room for cryptocurrencies to grow in value and it would only take a fraction of the money invested in gold, silver or fiat currencies to trigger the next leg up in the cryptocurrency rally."

Regarding 1, there was a time in the south pacific where big stones with holes in them (yap stones) were viewed as valuable assets by inhabitants and goods for exchange.  What was the intrinsic value of these stones? Arguably zero.  The stones were provided value by common consensus because they may have been perceived as having some advantages as store of value and currency.  Same goes with Bitcoin. And this doesn't mean the bitcoin network has no intrinsic value, which it may well have. 
There are many advantages of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies over gold and fiat that have been discussed and tabulated before. What stands out for me is the deflationary quality of bitcoin (21 million units), mathematical  foundations including precise inflation schedule, the censorship resistance of the network, and its potential use in the future revolutionary new crypto economy.
For 2, I believe in cryptocurrency in general, and you are right I am not fully confident that Bitcoin will be the future main currency, though it remains by far the strongest candidate among competing cryptos to be so, and even if not, bitcoin might still do quite well compared to fiat.  The best way to protect against this is to diversify, not to put all your eggs in one basket.

World wide debt incurred by govts as a result of past mistakes and squandering is unmanageable.  How will they get out of this? By inflating their fiat currencies, eventually.  Bitcoin and crypto are deflationary.  Hold your bitcoin, like the new generations are doing, and you will be ok.

You know, right you are with this.  There should be more compassion for the old people and those down on their luck who would get screwed, perhaps my comment was misguided.  On the other hand, governments probably need to inflate away their fiat to maintain a safety net for folks.  I heard from a socialist once that inflation is to be welcome, since it affects the wealthy but doesn't hurt the poor much because they don't have much to begin with. Thus inflation (Devaluation) is a good idea because it helps maintain the safety net for the poor; the ones screwed will be the bond-holders, who you rightly identify as mostly old people. Oh well, buy bitcoin instead.

The thing with bitcoin, unlike gold, is that it can be updated with the lightning network and other innovations, and there is the promise that it can be updated to encompass potential use cases it has lost.  
The more volume and value bitcoin has, the better it works as a settlement system capable to moving millions of dollars in value anonymously(not quite but along those lines) without any censorship, middle men, and relatively low transaction fees.
Bitcoin is also a gateway to the altcoin eco-system being built right now: ICOS, supercomputers, decentralized storage, decentralized social media, fintech, smart contracts, DAOS, and many many other youthful services that have the potential to be huge in the future. As this blockchain economy takes off, bitcoin will take off alongside.
Bitcoin also has a growing community of faithful hodlers who believe in it as a currency better than gold and fiat; it has survived through quite a lot of FUD and setbacks so far. This reliability, together with the community consensus and confidence it brings should not be underestimated.   
@_date: 2017-11-24 15:48:06
Objection  is of little concern to me and in fact would be a boon.  It would only serve to increase the value of bitcoin dramatically, and if the government then intends to burn their bitcoins this would be such egregious waste of tax payer money. And whatever bitcoin is left over it would be very very valuable anyways, I wouldn't sell them my bitcoin.  If you think the government can buy up or stop all of bitcoin, consider the post here about the kid trying to mop the ocean out of the beach.
Objection  I consider it very unlikely to the point of silliness.  The bitcoin code is open source with many developers of all inclinations taking a look at it,  somebody would have detected the back door by now.

Blockchain without bitcoin is just an alternative distributed database that has been found not compare significantly better to centralized database designs.

I wonder about the magnitude of these deflationary forces on an investors psyche.  Every moment some bitcoins are gone forever, increasing the value of remaining bitcoins.

There may be a bubble, but there are some things I don't get.  I was arguing with some bitcoin haters and they told me that nobody in their corporations knew or cared about bitcoin.  This for me is great news, because not everyone is on board yet, bitcoin and crypto have room to grow.
Bitcoin for me is a better alternative than gold for many reasons and is to be treated as a store of value better than gold. And gold has a 7 trillion market cap compared to bitcoin 250 billion or so.  I believe many of my fellow hodlers think like I do.
The 2000 dot.com bubble resulted in a loss 1.755 trillion dollars. And it was restricted fundamentally to the US.  Bitcoin is a global phenomenon.
But you are right that the increase in value has been pretty large in the short term, so a correspondingly large drop would not be surprising.
And in the long term, I shudder to think what the increase could be as the supply of bitcoin decreases by half each 4 years while people inevitably loss confidence in inflationary fiat.
And meanwhile the young generations seem to be taking up crypto and bitcoin as there own. And the the alt-coin ecosystem is expanding into a full blown economy offering a variety of digital services that may eventually replace current giants of the service economy.  If crypto is a technological revolution akin to the Gutenberg press many of us think, then bitcoin's ultimate value is vastly greater than what it is going for now.

Once they finish with BTC, they would use their mining equipment instead to monopolize the mining of their centralized coin; and if his dreams of domination come true the masses would move from BTC to  their centralized coin under the control and leadership of the bitFuhrer  .

The large ecological footprint and electricity costs from bitcoin mining would be a concern for me, which I believe might even be a hindrance to widespread adoption.

Thank you sir. I believe the most unmentioned value of bitcoin lies in the growing group of hodlers who are committed to it no matter what.   If bitcoin grows to mass adoption, then a faithful hodler will be rewarded with abundant riches.  Even if bitcoin becomes a niche market, then I am confident it still will be worthwhile as a refuge and insurance to future guaranteed upheavals in the fiat economy.  But an essential ingredient for bitcoin to continue to grow in adoption and value is the commitment and faith of the hodlers.

Three ways I can think off:  1. Setting up energy infrastructure through public works; keeping the citizens busy 2. Once electricity is cheap, then mining is a commodity like a country having gold mines or oil. Responsible administration means dividends for the citizens. 3. Sets the scene for adoption of bitcoin, ending the possibility of hyperinflation.

Time.  If bitcoin just survives during the next 10 years, with its decreasing inflation rate, growing adoption, conservative technological development, committed and young user base,  and relative advantages over competing currencies/store of value,   I do not find it hard to believe it will rise to the previous highs and exceed them some time during this time frame.

I am a person who is unlikely to let go of crypto once having tasted it, like I am unlikely to leave electricity after living with it, so based on my own experience, I think there is a high chance crypto sticks around.  I don't think the main demand bitcoin has even been seen yet, which will occur when an inevitable systemic banking crisis hits the western world.  People and insitutions will seriously flock to bitcoin then.  I find this form of money very attractive above centralized fiat and gold: its deflationary quality, independence from teetering economic systems, and the ability for me to make sovereign decisions without interference/confiscation/or incompetence by a third party.

Interesting question, I would have to value it at the market price.  If I valued it above the market, say at 100K, then that means I would not accept a 50K offer. But if I accepted a 50K offer then I could get bitcoin for free by buying back the bitcoin at market price and pockeing the difference, so I would be in my interest to value it at 50K.  By induction to 25K, 12.5K, etc . . . this leads to me value it slightly above the market price.

As currency, likely its not good, as store of value it is good/bad, as investment in tech/adoption I see is as good.  If appreciation is slow and methodical then it probably is the best for all three cases;  sharp appreciation like in december probably not that good generally as it leads to big volatility, unless you are short term speculator.  If it appreciates too much and hoarding increases,  then I speculate there will be a negative force downwards as it loses its use as currency until a balance of sorts is reach. This will probably be complex, rather than listen to economists and the perils of deflationary currency, I would rather listen to the market to see how these forces counter each other.

You can put your bitcoin to work in several ways.  
 If you are willing to move the bitcoin to your own wallet and research safety precautions, you can get airdrops from different projects, for example last year for your bitcoin you could get: gbytes, stellar, bitcoin cash, bitcoin gold, bitcore, and the list goes on;  these airdrops can bring in a tidy sum as a fraction of your total bitcoin.    With some more risk, you can earn interest in your bitcoin; consider bsave for example; or loan it (i.e. bitbond). I think with poloniex you can margin loan it and earn interest. You can end up losing money so its not very conservative; bsave took a cut when bitfinex was hacked, but to my knowledge it has remained reliable after that.

You might be right about sustainability, but all I see has been a tremendous growth trend in price since 2011 with the full story not being revealed yet.   When and if crypto follows the price trajectory of a bitconnect, I will acknowledge that such currencies are untenable. As some say, it may be that once bitcoin's market cap is sufficiently high, institutions begin to own it, governments more fully regulate it, and its young user base matures, that bitcoin's volatility will diminish and consequently is usability vastly improved, leading to a positive reinforcing feedback loop.
I think bitcoin's use cases, including gateway to the nascent crypto-economy, digital gold, hedge against fiat, and technology growth investment, is as real as its current use as currency, whether legal or illegal.
I am increasing realizing bitcoin is not only an alternative to gold and the dollar, but an alternative replacement for the whole frigging banking system, and strongly believe growth in user base and it use will naturally follow as people increasingly realize that.

Judging by previous bitcoin bear markets (jun2013, jan2014) there was a sharp v-shaped rebound after all the negativity (something like bitcoin going to 14K again) the price then "consolidates" and falls again after several months (or a very long time in bitcoin time) to a final low; once this plateau is reached, there is a period of quiet and low volatility and slowly people start accumulating again. One cannot say what will happen this time, but if one accepts similarity in psychology and history, etc . . . then the pattern is there.

I don't think bitcoin is incompatible with fractional reserve. Correct me if I am wrong, but here is my reasoning:  You can have a Bitcoin bank which has the trust of a group of people and who is entrusted to store their bitcoin safely.  Sometime later, the bank then starts using their stores to issue bitcoin IOUs (or tokens perhaps), promising to redeem an IOU with a bitcoin. Due to marketing and other incentives, people start trading and buying the IOUs on the market, and the bank quickly becomes wealthier by leveraging their bitcoin stores and issuing more IOU tokens than they have bitcoin.

I agree directly owning bitcoin will protect you against the perils of fractional reserve banking; but in the future, if you entrust your bitcoin to a bank for safekeeping or interest (as will likely many people), then the bank could implement a fractional reserve on top of bitcoin, so you could end up losing your bitcoin in case of a bank run.

The question for me is whether cryptocurrencies and the cryptoeconomy are here to stay and should eventually stand side by side in adoption and utility with fiat and gold thus taking its place as a legitimate alternative.  If so, then today's price is a bargain and current market cap is very small compared to what it will eventually be. Value held in gold is 8 trillion market cap, value held in fiat is much higher.  Value held by cryptocurrencies is 300billion.   Such value of cryptocurrencies should be much higher if you answer in the affirmative (a significant part of which will likely be bitcoin).

“Bitcoin is not functional as a means of payment, but it relies on the oxygen provided by the connection to standard means of payments and trading apps that link users to conventional bank accounts,” Carstens said in Frankfurt on Tuesday.
“If the only ‘business case’ is use for illicit or illegal transactions, central banks cannot allow such tokens to rely on much of the same institutional infrastructure that serves the overall financial system and freeload on the trust that it provides.”
So much wrong with this.  So I cannot use the money in the bank as I see fit? All I want is to buy something and you are complaining?

This is possible, but I surmise   Bitcoin and crypto could turn out to be something like the drugs in the drug war, impossible to eradicate despite all the expenditure.  Hackers will still demand bitcoin ransoms. I don't think its value will rise as much as if it where legal. However, places like Japan and Switzerland which have legalized the use of bitcoin will experience greater influx of wealth and fin-tech development as capital flees the repressive nations.

Now that Venezuela has received important sums by issuing tokens, other countries will start to pay attention and will be sorely tempted to issue their own tokens, bypassing the bond markets and other markets.
The catch is that once they issue their own cryptocurrencies, they will soon be confronted by the fact that they need to pay off the miner of their coins for little security. Why not issue tokens on top of the smart contract platforms, why not in fact on top of bitcoin for the best security?   Its in our favor!

I suspect these economists restrict means of payment to specific services like buying coffee, etc . . . According to other sources the total transaction value in bitcoin is about 600 billion per year (extrapolating from last 3 months 2017).  Using their math, this would value bitcoin at $10K.

Politics aside, I regard this as a big victory for bitcoin. For the first time in history, a nation's govt has seemingly fully embraced cryptocurrencies.
They are planning to set up and nurture cryptocurrency mining and trading industries; they certainly have a global comparative advatange given the cost of electricity in  mining bitcoin. It is not foolish to think Venezuela would be the first country to start accumulating bitcoin reserves.
They are also planning to nurture the use of the petro by paying salaries in petros and I believe making cryptocurrency exchange legal. I thought and said as much the petro would be a centrally stored digital currency, but I was wrong; it is going to be a genuine cryptocurrency eventually, with its own blockchain, I presume a variation of the bitcoin code. Being so, whether it succeeds or fails, I am optimistic it will be a gateway to the crypto-economy and easily tradable with bitcoin and the other alt-coins. I sense this is an important step in gradually taking the country down the path of bitcoinization (or cryptolization for sure), as people lose trust in the backing of the petro and start trading of their petros for other better performing coins.
I believe that as other countries see the advantages of bitcoinization and the benefits it will bring to Venezuela they will start to emulate Venezuela's experiment. Thus Venezuela will be like the domino that starts a chain reaction.  This will be aided by the fact that many countries have governments chaffing about the "imperialist dollar" so they will looking to conduct transactions in a neutral currency free of US based banks/trading centers. In time, thus, I see no better suited replacement as reserve currency than bitcoin or a basket of cryptocurrencies.

I think so.  As a novelty museum-piece network at least (being the original public cryptocurrency);  As one of the fundamental backbone networks of future civilization at most.  My view is that paper money could be around, but not the same denominations. The dollar for instance will be inflated to oblivion and will change to the "New dollar" or "Amero". Gold will still be around but will lose its luster with future digital generations, unless there is a civilizational reset.

Isn't coinbase like a bank or have makings of a bitcoin bank?  You are entrusting your bitcoins to it, and right now it stores it for you.  In the future it could start lending out some of stored bitcoin and paying you some interest and go on a fractional reserve.

My point above was why governments would prefer to issue their own crypto: because , among other things, they can have inflation and control the inflation rate.
Although a separate issue, I think countries issuing their own crypto would definitely take away value from BTC, specially if said countries start prohibiting or discouraging the use of BTC.  However such loss may be temporary in the long run, as the government cryptos will suffer from uncontrolled inflation(like fiat), increased centralization, and lower regional influence compared to global influence of public cryptos.

True, you have to work at storing your bitcoins so as to feel safe you will not lose access (i.e. cold storage, multiple hardware wallets, other security measures), though it is not as bad as it sounds. Would you prefer this risk to the possibility of bank runs and holidays?  In some countries your accounts may be insured up to a certain point . . but in other countries your accounts may even be confiscated by the government. And if things get out of control, banks will not hesitate in taking away the wealth you entrusted to them for their own survival as well as "survival of the national economy".

Although you don't believe in bitcoin, this is different from the belief that the cryptocurrency  industry will grow to mass adoption.   If so, then there is the belief that the industry's market cap will be  dominated by one coin. if so, then there is the belief that bitcoin is a better bet right now than other candidates to do so. I am inclined to the last belief based on the fact it retains and will retain significant advantage over competitors through its "7 network effects (Trace Meyer)". Furthermore,  I  think there will be room for some successful cryptos, but bitcoin will be an important part of the picture  for the foreseeable future.

Followed by problems that governments and third parties can confiscate what you own without your consent and maybe unjustly from your perspective.  Even if there is just cause, they additionally have the privilege to abuse the penalties they can impose.   Then there is the problem that they can spy and keep track of your monies.

There is no fixed maximum for Ethereum, but the schedule is 99 million by 2025, 101 million by 2128, and 104 by 5189.
Inflation is thus not a concern for me based on this, but a valid suspicion could be that since there is no fixed cap, the Eth powers might renege sometime in the future.

I've been reading lately a counter-argument that bitcoin's limited supply does not prevent dilution because crypto supply can be arbitrarily augmented by creating altcoins.
My reply to that is that the increased competition from industry and token inflation through dilution are two separate concepts.  The former challenge can be addressed by appealing to Bitcoin's wide moat and benefits vs a vis other altcoins, although it is not entirely out of the question that a competitor may upstage Bitcoin in the future.  The latter challenge is one that Bitcoin is immune to and a massive plus compared to other assets which are subject to uncertain dilution which in many situations (i.e. currency monetary inflation, stock ownership dilution) gives the issuer an unfair hidden advantage.

I think Bitcoins and most altcoins are highly correlated and will be in the medium term, but altcoins have been way more volatile. In the long term I think the correlation will remain for the most successful ones at least, so the fate of one is the fate of the other, with differences in the magnitudes of the gains but uptrends and down trends being similar.

What I have learned is that Bitcoin has had several bubbles and has made new highs each time after. Did this happen with the South Sea Company?

Bitcoin has rallied so much now even now when fiat in most of the world is fairly stable and world economy is "OK".  Imagine once people in the rest of the world (other than Venezuela/Argentina which are hiperinflating) really lose confidence in fiat money; what would happen to Bitcoin? Could that be the 'Titanic' moment when everybody will be begging to get onto the Crypto lifeboat?

The dollar has a lot of staying power. I have been anticipating hyperinflation since 2011 but it has not occurred; It will eventually happen, but it might happen in 2056 for all I know.   Bitcoin can serve as long-term insurance for this event but I am not expecting it to occur soon.

Governments legal counterfeiting of their own money through money printing (aka 'debt monetization')  and the whims of fickle, often corrupt, and short sighted elites at their helm creates uncontrollable and chaotic price inflation in the long run.  Bitcoin cannot be counterfeited and its monetary supply is mathematical and exactly predictable.

There will  likely be recession next year 2019 if not a worldwide economic crisis and based on this late crypto crash it seems bitcoin may be sensitive to that, so upside is limited. My best bet is after the halving 2020+1 year after crypto hangover phase is a memory and central banks respond to the economic disaster  with helicopter money.

May be a bad move.  Bitcoin is not only a store of value but the gateway and reserve currency so far to the growing Crypto Economy powered by the blockchains. The killer app is the crypto economy which is in its nascent stages.

I do not follow with regards to divisibility. Divisibility is a great property because it would allow microtransactions and other applications which could be in demand in the future with the Internet of Things, though Bitcoin is limited at the moment due to high transaction fees. 
With regards to splitting, you may have a point on Bitcoin. There may be multiple bitcoins in the future, and on top of this we have altcoins who could supplant Bitcoin's role and reduce its value as a result. A few months ago I would have said this was not likely, but now with declining dominance trend and also internecine conflict, the probability of split increases.  It is possible this could translate to loss of some of your investment, but under many scenarios, not necessarily. If bitcoin splits, you will have same number of bitcoins on both chains so it may not be a complete loss and furthermore a dominant chain could reassert itself. Perhaps this is more risky vs fiat? Not for me.
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:13:27
I expect volatility, there will be a flight to safety; cryptos are perceived as risky by many so there will be a sell-off, then the powers will step in to fight deflation and inflate monetary supply resulting in decreased confidence in fiat. I expect Cryptos will then make new highs based on this.

I wouldn't begin to imagine the immense political pressure on bitcoin core.  At that stage the governments would likely have coopted core; with a "security council" arrangement in the United Nations where influential nations places their representative and commit access alone worth a couple of wars.  The world will be furthermore divided between the doctrines of  bitcoin centralization vs decentralization and the manner to achieve them. There likely will a anti-bitcoin resistance front involved in terrorism actions throughout the world.

Another option in case the exchanges are too restrictive is to use the bitshares DEX and buy bit-USD which is pegged to the dollar (or another commodity like bitGold), then take my time cashing out. Also get tether USDT?

Write of your investment as a complete loss and a learning experience, but do not sell.  There is a fair chance crypto-currencies will be worth trillions in the future and that bitcoin will correspondingly be much higher than today.

The following thread in  presents some nice figures comparing bitcoin, gold, and fiat.  
Gold, bitcoin, and dollar are compared over the following attributes: Spendability, Anonymity, Transfer delay, Transaction fees, Non-counterfeitability, Theft resistance, Open source, Durability, Inflation proof, Irreversible payments, Decentralization, Divisibility, Scarcity, Non-Monetary Usefulness, &amp; Shininess
Out of 45 points,
Bitcoin scores 42 points (misses 3 because its not shiny)
Fiat scores: 1 point
Gold scores: 15 points
I would be more charitable with fiat and take some points from bitcoin due to present circumstances, but the difference will still be uncontestable.
