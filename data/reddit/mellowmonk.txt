That's basically all drug gang killings, too—dirtbags who'd rather kill each other than pay what they owe. 
Or you could say it's because the gangs don't have resource to the litigation and justice systems. I mean, if an organization can outsource contract enforcement to the government, they would.

Why should Wozniak be any different than anyone on Reddit? People are just cheerleading whatever investment they hold; there's such a dearth of objective analysis out there.

It's kind of understandable, given how we're constantly being presented what is sure to be the "next big thing." So I wonder what it is we're overlooking right now.

See, it's using terms like this that make me think Bitcoin users are a bunch of yahoos.

See, this is while I'll never use Bitcoin to actually *pay* for anything, because who knows how high it could rise after payment.
Won't that, though, prevent it from become a widely used currency?

How is self-regulation different from no regulation?

Same as all the crypto subs on Reddit, in other words.

I think that means that TA *as a whole* is statistically the same as random chance, meaning that a few analysts are going to be dead-on and make a bundle, so the key is probably looking at an analyst's track record on past similar investments and their qualifications in general.
