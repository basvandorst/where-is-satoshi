No it's not, if you read the article, you'll see that they hacked a bank in Bangladesh, stole a private key and faked a SWIFT message signature using that.
Same thing that happens every week with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:11:43
That's not correct. In any situation you can use the last signed transaction which means you're not losing anything.
@_date: 2016-04-19 11:13:40

This is settlement of securities, which is not the same thing.
For bitcoin, a transaction is settled only when it's recorded on the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-04-28 18:03:49
They invested in pretty much [every Bitcoin company](
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:10:08
Yes. Given you need to do it every week (and close the channel, which is a transaction too).

No that's not the case, and there isn't really any way to cheat, except maybe trying to stall the channel, in which case, you're blocking both your coins and the other party's coins until the channel times out.

Yes channels expire, that's how you get your money back if the other party refuses to close the channel.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:36:43
If the node you're connected to has an outbound capacity of 0.5 BTC, then no, you won't be able to send more than 0.5 BTC. In fact, you'll have to share that 0.5 BTC capacity with the other users connected to that node.
People don't realize that for LN to successfully scale, it will have to become massively centralized around the 2 or 3 companies that have enough liquidity to operate at that scale (probably Coinbase and a couple others). See [this]( for more details.

Again, you're completely wrong. You'll always pay the same price whether you pay in cash or in card. Charging a higher price for VISA payment is against the merchant ToS and will get your VISA merchant account shut down.
And even if fees were carried over, that wouldn't show up on you statement like you claimed it was.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:52:45
Of course there is a risk/reward tradeoff, which also is why transactions can't be completely free on LN.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:55:55
Decentralized, cheap/high-throughput. Pick one.
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:30:36
That's the point. If people start aggregating around hubs, there may not be enough capacity in routes going around it.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:26:03
That's a lot of money for a shitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-20 00:26:44

@_date: 2018-01-01 14:49:30
That's not what settled means.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:23:36

Exactly, the consumer pays for credit card processing fees even if they pay in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-27 13:16:22
More channels to where? 30% of the network is only reachable through that hub.
LN is not economically viable if you have to open a channel for each recipient you're trying to pay.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:19:17
Not nearly as wrong as you were.
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:06:51
Same for me, that thread was confusing as hell.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:55:53
Finally someone who understands LN.
There is no doubt companies that agree to lock up capital in a LN channel won't be doing that for free.
@_date: 2018-01-20 15:28:42
First: that old and tired argument about centralization is just wrong. With Moore's law, bandwidth increases every year, if we increase the block size at the same pace as Moore's law, we're not increasing the cost of running a node. This, in fact, is Satoshi's original thoughts on scaling.
Second: lightning networks or not, everyone agrees a block size increase is needed. Doing it this year or three years ago makes no difference long term, and at least we wouldn't have had to deal with Bitcoin's slow agony.
@_date: 2018-01-01 20:39:15
A LN transaction can be reverted if both the recipient and the sender agree, so yes, a transaction is settled only when it's recorded on the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-01-18 11:32:53
So you *are* in the scam business?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:20:06

@_date: 2018-01-01 10:10:47
LN doesn't provide instant settlement. Settlement only happens when the channel closes, potentially months later.

Again you are wrong, and this shows how little you understand about the subject. VISA isn't charging you anything, the account maintenance fee is charged by your bank and is unrelated to your card. A lot of banks don't charge any maintenance fee by the way.
And if we're talking about VISA credit cards, in most cases, you're actually getting paid in form of cashback for using the card.

See, that's where you're wrong. There **IS** an overnight fix. In fact it was on the table 3 years ago, and that's the simplest fix that's ever been proposed. It's called a block size increase.
Bitcoin wouldn't be losing its dominance if we had listened to people like Gavin and Mike Hearn 3 years ago.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:51:33
If you're holding, that means you're not buying as much as you could have been buying.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:25:56
That's for the merchant dumbass, not the consumer.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:30:49
Wrong, that most recent signed transaction is only minable at a future date, when the hashed timelocked contract expires. The only way to close the channel before expiry is if both parties are cooperative.
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:57:03
Trillions of dollars get exchanged golbally every day for a few hundred million dollars in fees. It's 0.01% fees. This doesn't exist with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:31:50
And then startcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-18 12:15:04
Not true, the risk is proportional to the transaction volume, so the percentage fee will be the same.
In fact large hubs can realize economies of scale when securing funds so likely smaller hubs will have to charge higher fees.
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:46:28
The assumptions are completely unrealistic. 14 channels per node? At $20 per transaction, you're saying every user will be willing to pay an average of $280 every few months to use LN.
Also, 10 million nodes with 14 channels each means 7 million transactions to repeat every few months (when the channel expires), which we all know the Bitcoin network can't handle in its current state.
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:08:52

Let's just say r/bitcoin used to be relevant 4 years ago. It no longer is.
@_date: 2017-12-19 10:13:38
Yes that's the only way to get transactions to confirm.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:53:11
And so is the parent comment.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:41:04
Most people understood why I said that, but you're a bit slow do I'll spell it out for you.
Bitcoin Core has segwit support, so yes you can implement segwit in one day if you use Bitcoin Core. Coinbase has its own Bitcoin implementation which means they need to implement it from scratch in their stack. That's significant engineering work, certainly months of work.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:29:44

What is this? 2011?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:32:05
The duration of the channel is also how long your coins would remain frozen in case of uncooperative channel close.
So if you have 3 months channels and someone you're routing your coins through doesn't like you, you can expect your coins to be frozen for 3 months.
Realistically, for a good user experience, channels would need to stay open for a couple of days, not even a month.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:05:42
Wrong, capital gains tax applies when you've realized a gain. If you're only buying bitcoins, you haven't realized a gain yet.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:25:32
That's not how capital gains tax works.
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:08:14
Ah yes, the good old r/bitcoin persecutory delusion
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:45:22
People who can afford a $30 wire transfer can afford running a full node with 8MB blocks, so you've just demonstrated 8MB blocks wouldn't increase centralization.
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:08:48


Exactly. OP hasn't sold anything, therefore CGT does not apply.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:24:40
Well you don't, but you're supposed to.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:15:12
Do you realize Coinbase doesn't run Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:50:48
Interesting question, but you could see things the other way around. If LN cost $100 per month, the majority of people won't be using it.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:35:55
Occam's razor: the simplest solution is usually the best one.
Increase in block size.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:14:33
Let's be clear, segwit is too little too late. And yes, [it's always been obvious for anyone a little familiar with Bitcoin]( that segwit would take years for adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:33:56
No that's not how it works in the US or anywhere else. Increasing your investment amount doesn't make you realize a gain.

Yes something's fishy. This community still hasn't apologized to Gavin Andresen despite the fact it's become blatantly obvious his solution was the correct one.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:35:04
Anyone who supported SegWit over a block size increase, not knowing this would happen, is an idiot.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:09:42

That would have been shocking 4 years ago. Banks have been using Blockchain and even Bitcoin for a while now.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:19:55
Yes, under the assumption that the majority of transactions are happening off chain. Which is unlikely to be correct.

OP probably bought his first coins two weeks ago.
@_date: 2015-12-15 16:13:09
Sorry, I forgot this is I'll spell everything out from now on.
What I mean is that if you need one payment channel for every party you are transacting with, then you can already do that today, you don't need LN. Payment channels have been around for at least 18 months.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:25:16
Not the fees you paid to open the channel. That's a regular on-chain transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:31:35
Irrespective of the date, Coinbase is doing a tiny number of transactions compared to the overall volume.
@_date: 2015-12-02 00:41:40


Let me guess... Chrome?
@_date: 2015-12-04 21:52:33

@_date: 2017-12-31 14:42:49
The GUI is as important as the rest. It's not finished until the GUI is released.
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:18:43
And yet, everyone is talking about Lightning Networks which is all about reintroducing a distinction between settlement and payment for Bitcoin, so that it can scale like systems from the "old world".
@_date: 2015-12-18 10:49:16
Yes, but why would anyone connect through you? Answer: they won't.
This is like saying: "if your laptop has a wifi connection, you might as well charge people for accessing the internet through it". Except people can just access the internet from their own laptop or phones.
@_date: 2015-12-28 10:37:28
A middleman which you have to trust. That makes quite a big difference.
@_date: 2015-12-19 18:07:13
It doesn't matter how it scales, what matters is that it's a variable if you look at the whole network, and complexity analysis requires a system with fixed resources.
In that case, the right system to look at is a single node within the network. The rest is explained in Gavin's blog post.
@_date: 2015-12-19 17:52:50


It's obviously not. If you get a new participant, more bandwidth is available to the network.
What you are saying would only be true if everyone was directly connected to everyone else.
@_date: 2015-12-30 23:22:02
Actually, this couldn't be more wrong. Lightning Network is all about delaying settlement.
@_date: 2015-12-18 13:58:10
A Blockchain **is** a database, get over it.
@_date: 2015-12-17 09:09:34
Fees must be much cheaper than normal Bitcoin transaction fees or there is no benefit in using your hub. Which means you're not going to cover the costs of running a node unless you are processing millions of transactions per months.

You're gonna be obliterated by downvotes, but yes, you're absolutely right.
Nature centralizes things because it's more efficient. Pluricellular beings are the result of the centralization of colonies of micro-organisms. Cities are the result of centralization of habitat, etc.
Decentralization is unnatural and except in some very specific use cases (such as Bitcon), makes no sense.

You guys keep talking about developers, but developers are nothing without users actually using what they create.
If you create a system where early adopters have an advantage, you get a boost early on, but adoption stalls later on. You can see that with mastercoin. Most people who own MSC are the people who initially invested.

Well bacterial infections cause inflammation, which can cause mutations. Not rocket science. H Pylori has been linked to stomach cancer for example. Understanding of biology is not very useful if you can't put 2 and 2 together.

90% of cases can't be explained by anything (as of today), and the only study on the subject shows a massive correlation between Lyme and ALS. You're right there is no follow up study, which means there is no study disproving the results of the initial study. If the study is so obviously wrong, it should be easy to disprove, so why did nobody do it?
Your argument goes both ways. Until proved otherwise, it's a possibility that the unexplained cases are actually Lyme and not ALS.


Well the CDC statistics are know for vastly underreporting Lyme infections: 
Lyme occurs in all the states, and all countries where ticks are present. Again, the tests for Lyme are very unreliable, which is why misdiagnosis for Lyme are a problem in the first place.
There are clusters of ALS, like the [Kelly air force base]( which happens to be near a forest infested with ticks.


Here you're wrong, ALS diagnoses will improve as we lean more about the diseases that are mistaken for ALS, which includes Lyme. ALS is the default diagnosis. What we need to improve diagnosis, is being able to attribute a case to something else than ALS when it is something else.

@_date: 2014-07-07 23:13:14
Yes, exactly. Once the block reward is gone, either fees will go through the roof, or miners will go out of business and security of the network will go down dramatically.

A hard fork doesn't mean Bitcoin fails permanently either. There is a long road between where we are now, and where we need to be with Bitcoin.

It's a metaphor. Let me explain.
Alt-coins and sidechains offer features that the main Bitcoin chain doesn't have (different confirmation time, asset coloring, DNS alternative in case of namecoin etc...).
You have to pay to use altcoins' features, by buying an alt-coin and risking to lose your investment (the risk you are taking is a cost). potentially, you may also be paying the developer who pre-mined the chain. Also, you're prisoner of the alt-coin, you can't cash out of the alt-coin without renouncing to the features it offers.
This is similar to having to pay license fees with closed source software, and vendor lock in, preventing you to move to a competitor.
On the other side, with sidechains, you don't have to take exposure on anything else than BTC, which is quite stable and safe. You know it's not going to go to zero overnight, it's accepted in more and more places, etc... So there's no cost in using the features side chains offer (or let's say minimal cost). Also, there no lock-in. You can cash out of a sidechain specialized in micro payment, and move your money to a side chain that offers a DNS replacement (a namecoin equivalent). That's full interoperability.
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:05:08

You're really thinking inside the box here. Who talked about an extra account. A private key is an authentication mechanism, which can also be used off-chain.

Let say you want to use ethereum's smart contracts. You have two choices:
- A: You buy ethers and use the alt-chain
- B: You use bitcoins and use the siedechain
With A you are getting exposure to ethers, so if the value crashes for one reason or another, you lost a lot of money. With B, no matter what happens, your 1 BTC is always worth 1 BTC. It's much safer for you, and you get the same feature set.
@_date: 2014-02-03 01:51:17
This is all probability. But if the guy is lucky, he might have found that address after searching for 1 second. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 15:07:56
When presented with that choice, the user will pick A if he wants to speculate on the value of ETH, and B if he wants to use the actual technology.
That means A has very weak fundamentals.
This is like tulip bulbs during the bubble: If you want a nice flower to decorate your garden, you'll buy another flower that 100 times less expensive, and looks more or less the same. If you only want to speculate, you'll get the tulip bulb. Now we both know how this ends.

I said implement, not integrate. Doesn't that bother you that you can only use Counterparty by using the "official" software? The consensus rules are too complex for anyone to implement it without using Counterpartyd.
More complex consensus rules also means easier to hard fork by accident.


It's a general engineering principle: simpler is better. The challenge is not in building something complex, it's in building something simple. Eventually, the simpler system is cheaper to use and maintain. VHS won against betamax because it was simpler and cheaper to manufacture (even though it had a lower image quality).


0.5 XCP was really not much, so it was never really an advantage. Also, transactions are still more expensive than colored coins because of the dust you have to send for multi-sig outputs.

Yes, he said in his AMA that he prefers systems that don't use the blockchain for long term storage (which is exactly what counterparty is doing here).
Orisi is a good start, and I think a smart oracle engine with turing complete scripting language is the way to go.
Now that counterparty has ported the EVM to Counterparty, people will slowly start to realize that this is something that is **extremely expensive** to do on a Blockchain.
An off-blockchain tustless system like Orisi can be an order of magnitude cheaper, while still providing the right incentives for people to run the oracle nodes.

Counterparty can be used for betting and gambling.
Colored coins can't (or rather there is no core support for it) but are closer to how bitcoin works, so they can use SPV, you can accept unconfirmed transactions, you can use coin mixers for anonymity, and you can use micropayment channels for fast, trustless and cheap transactions. None of this can work with CP. Colored coins also is not tied to a meta-coin like XCP.
The colored coin protocols are defined once and then placed in public domain, much like the W3C standards. The Counterparty protocol on the other hand is defined by whatever code is put in counterpartyd, so now overstock has basically bought the ability to add/remove features, change fees and break compatibility at will.
Mastercoin is like counterparty, but with less features.

If Bitcoin can't take the traffic created by a single website, and we can only keep it working by stopping people from making transactions *they are paying for*, that means it is doomed.
Personally, I think we should actively work and invest on technologies like side-chains and tree-chains to make sure Bitcoin can scale out. Preventing people from making transactions is really against everything Bitcoin stands for.

This is something that could be solved if colored coins wallet used a different representation of bitcoin addresses for sending colored coins. Then colored coin wallets would refuse to send the colored coins to a "legacy" address.
What's bothering with counterparty is that there is no guarantee that it won't be changed in an unfavourable way in the future. Whatever gets submitted in the counterpartyd code is what becomes official. Now that overstock "bought" one of the dev, they will try to push changes they want to the code. They very well could decide to increase fees, disable features like betting because it's not good for the SEC, etc... nobody really knows. I am not saying they will, but the lack of guarantee of what the protocol will be in the future is a risk. Sure you can fork it if things go south, but do you really want to try to compete against overstock?

Until now, there was pretty much no utility to XCP, so that wasn't really an issue, but now that smart contracts are going to require XCP (and potentially be quite expensive), there is a very good reason to fork.

The network doesn't relay double spends, which is also why SPV wallets work. Colored coins can use that same assumption whereas XCP can't.


Let me give you an example: You own some asset X in address A. The issuer of asset X can recall your assets, which disappear from address A without you even signing anything.
Other example: you place a P2P bet, the oracle making the broadcast announcing the winner of the bet triggers a change of your balance without you signing anything.


The whole business of being a market maker relies on paying as little fees as possible. Also, market makers place hundreds of orders for ever one trade executed - so it's more like 101 fees instead of 1. That's actually an example of why market marker DON'T want to use such system.
@_date: 2014-10-04 15:01:46
See the problem is that active development of counterpartyd equals protocol changes. You can see it's fortunately not the case with Bitcoin, or any other widespread protocols (HTTP, TCP, SMTP, etc...). Implementations get improved on a regular basis by the different vendors, yet the protocols have been set in stone for decades.
There is probably a dozen different implementations of the bitcoin protocol, that can be use instead of Bitcoind: Mike Hearn's BitcoinJ, Amir Taaki's LibBitcoin, BitPay's BitCore, BitcoinJS, NBitcoin, etc...
I'm challenging anyone to build at least one compatible alternative to counterpartyd. Being open source isn't of much use if there is a change to the consensus rules every week - even minor.

Wrong, only 10% of ALS cases are genetic. The 90% remaining have no know cause (if you ask mainstream doctors). Lyme is both not reliably diagnosed, and not treated properly. [Several studies]( have shown a strong correlation between ALS patients and Lyme infections.
I know what I am talking about, my grandfather died from ALS last year. After he got diagnosed with ALS, I suggested to the doctor to run a blood test for Lyme. Like you, he laughed at me. We then tried 3 or 4 different doctors, they all had the same reaction. I finally found a doctor willing to order a test. Guess what? The test came back positive. They prescribed him a course of 3 weeks of antibiotics. After the second week, there was some very small signs of remission: he was able to move his arm which had been paralyzed for months. In the end, the disease was too advanced and the antibiotics course was too short to make a difference, nevertheless, all the neurologists claimed that any sign of remission was impossible in case of ALS, since it's a degenerative disease. They couldn't come up with any explanation.
Also, it's of course not a proof, but I spent hours reading various forums, and the number of people with ALS who also tested positive for a Lyme infection is extremely disturbing, for something that's supposed to be a very rare infectious disease.
Also, the bacteria responsible for Lyme is of the same family as the one responsible for Syphilis, which is know to cause neurological symptoms such as ALS.
Sure the Big Pharma theory is not the whole picture. There is also the pride of doctors who have been taught all their lives that ALS can't be cured, and have let hundreds of patients die already. They're not going to welcome the idea that they could have been saved with a simple course of antibiotics (the doctor who actually accepted to test for Lyme was the youngest we've consulted with). There is also the fact that long term antibiotics are frowned upon (yet the WHO does recommend it for Syphilis). And there is also the fact that current tests for Lyme are know to have an extremely high rate of false negatives.
I suggest you check the documentary "[Under our skin]( about Lyme disease, if you want to have an idea of the extent of the epidemic.

Well Ethereum and Mastercoin are basically a way to fund development by using a ponzi scheme.
@_date: 2014-08-03 17:11:39
Two points:
1. This is FUD spread by Ethereum about colored coins to justify the need for their project. Peter Todd has since proven SPV is possible with colored coin and fairly efficient. Treechains are even based on that idea.
2. The reason Vitalik took the example of colored coins, is that with colored coins, SPV is hard but possible. With mastercoin and counterparty, it's *not even possible*. With MSC and XCP you always need to scan every single Counterparty (or Mastercoin) transaction in the blockchain, even if they have nothing to do with your wallet. At least with colored coin, you only need to scan a small percentage of the whole transaction graph. So my point still stands:

Of course they require consensus. It's not as critical as for bitcoin, but it's important nonetheless. Go tell that to any company who built a website in the last 15 years, and had to double their budgets just because of "consensus" issues between different browsers.


Well read again what you just wrote. It's not how it works in the real world. First, IE is closed source, second, it's windows only, and third, you're assuming the consensus critical code can be easily extracted. In the real world, we write an official specification of the consensus (i.e. the W3C specs), and implementations have to match that. It's a much more sane approach, and more viable on the long term.

This is semantics. It might not be O(1) but what matters is that it sets the incentives exactly right.
The more you deviate from others in your selection of transactions, the bigger the block gets. Miners want small blocks, so they will try to follow what others are doing. If you want to censor transactions, you'll pay for it with an increased propagation time. O(n) is actually a desirable characteristic here.

There is a caveat not mentioned by Adam: the same guarantees that Bitcoin provides in a POS situation don't exist with counterparty. Namely, Bitcoin guarantees that in absence of double spend from participants, a valid transaction will still be valid after a reorganization. This is not the case with counterparty, which makes it more risky to use unconfirmed than Bitcoin or colored coins.

To quote the bitcoin dev mailing list:
How it works:
1. to maintain the 21m coins promise, you start a side-chain with no
in-chain mining subsidy, all bitcoin creation happens on bitcoin chain (as
with 1-way peg).  Reach a reasonable hash rate.  (Other semantics than 1:1
peg should be possible, but this is the base case).
2. you move coins to the side-chain by spending them to a fancy script,
which suspends them, and allows them to be reanimated by the production of
an SPV proof of burn on the side-chain.
3. the side-chain has no mining reward, but it allows you to mint coins at
no mining cost by providing an SPV proof that the coin has been suspended as
in 2 on bitcoin.  The SPV proof must be buried significantly before being
used to reduce risk of reorganization.  The side-chain is an SPV client to
the bitcoin network, and so maintains a view of the bitcoin hash chain (but
not the block data).
4. the bitcoin chain is firewalled from security bugs on the side chain,
because bitcoin imposes the rule that no more coins can be reanimated than
are currently suspend (with respect to a given chain).
5. to simplify what they hypothetical bitcoin change would need to consider
and understand, after a coin is reanimated there is a maturity period
imposed (say same as fresh mined coins).  During the maturity period the
reanimation script allows a fraud proof to spend the coins back.  A fraud
bounty fee (equal to the reanimate fee) can be offered by the mover to
incentivize side-chain full nodes to watch reanimations and search for fraud
6. a fraud proof is an SPV proof with a longer chain showing that the proof
of burn was orphaned.

Not sure why you're dismissing the peer-reviewed [Halperin paper]( showing that in the study, 47% of ALS patients were infected with Lyme as opposed to 0.086% in the normal population.


At this point, this is pure speculation. At least the Lyme hypothesis has plenty of anecdotal evidence. You're clearly biased because of your work.
And, by the way, Lyme could be causing mutations.


You're so naive, that's cute.
In any case, there are some ongoing studies coming from the Lyme angle.


Right. I agree with you, it's not ALS, and actual ALS is probably 10 times less prevalent than doctors think it is. In other words, 9 out of 10 patients diagnosed with ALS are misdiagnosed. I'll stop calling ALS "Lyme" when doctors do the same.

There is major difference. If there were such a fork, with Bitcoin, the minority chain is insecure because it can get attacked by the miners of the majority chain. With XCP, there is no mining, so both forks are equally secure.

Well let's see. If you take away all counterparty features that require XCP, what are you left with?

Didn't I already reply to that strawman argument? The difference with forking bitcoin is that alt-networks are way less secure than bitcoin. 
Forking XCP means the clone is as secure as the original. Plus the network effect is irrelevant in this case: every time you create a token, you create a new network as far as the network effect is concerned. The only think that connects your token to other existing tokens, and where the network effect could have been relevant, is the XCP currency, but again the end user doesn't need any XCP to transfer tokens.


It's an open protocol, they can compete without forking the protocol, by building on the same protocol. It's actually a better strategy not to fork it because they can leverage the existing infrastructure which they get for free.
@_date: 2014-11-21 23:42:18
Like so many people here, your perception of colored coins seems to come from misinformation and counterparty propaganda.


CC is definitely the right way to go for user created assets. It's not trying to do anything else. However, it nails user created assets.


It took 5 months for open assets to go from inception to finalized - faster than Counterparty.


Colored coins are an order of magnitude simpler than counterparty. Just compare the reference implementations for colored coins (300 lines of code) and Counterparty (10,000 lines of code).

No that has nothing to do with malleability. The blockchain regularly forks for a few blocks (sometimes more), when a client has to switch to a different fork because it was on the shortest one, that is called a reorganization. Vanilla Bitcoin can handle it (it's designed to), whereas Counterparty is vulnerable to it and some transaction could become invalid after a reorg.
@_date: 2014-09-13 10:09:32
Well it's rather simple. The value of bitcoin is not in the technology, it's in the network. If you fork bitcoin, you get a new network, powered by a new coin, entirely incompatible with the existing bitcoin. There are billions of dollars invested in bitcoin (miners, entrepreneurs, investors, soon wall street...). If you fork bitcoin, all of the sudden you're alone against everybody else.The network effect that bitcoin had been building for years is what makes bitcoin valuable.On the other hand, someone forking ethereum at its launch will have equal network effect with the real ethereum.
@_date: 2014-06-23 12:24:16
The colored coin system is not an app coin: all you need to use it is a small amount of Bitcoin.

Of course, the same applies to Bitcoin. And Litecoin and Dogecoin are perfect examples of what would happen to your fork if you decided to fork XCP: the network effect would disincentive anyone from moving to the fork.
Sure the project is open source, but forking the code doesn't get you anywhere. The "community" of two people making the decisions about the development of XCP is like the Bitcoin foundation - except at least there is extensive peer review and scrutiny when a change is made to Bitcoin.

That is certainly not the case. MSC/XCP cannot deal with unconfirmed transactions. That pretty much rules out retail transactions all together, as well as any kind of face to face transaction.
That also rules out micropayment channels, and basically any kind of use case that uses unconfirmed transactions.


Well, that is mostly false. Peter Todd has described a way to do SPV in a much more efficient way than that.


There are more creative ways to solve the problem, as long as you can do atomic swaps. You can build a system where order are not necessarily always enforceable, yet is still more efficient than the XCP decentralized exchange.


Having to pay fees to place an order, and wait 10 minutes for the order to confirm is clearly what I call a failed experiment. A blockchain is a low throughput, high latency system. A good exchange is high throughput, low latency. It's clearly a case of wrong tool for the job.

You realize that the purpose of this thread is to bust the myth that open source software (that includes Linux) is more secure than closed source software?

Proof of Work has many problems, and many of those could be addressed by Proof of Stake:

Decentralization for the sake of decentralization is absurd. What truly matters is dentralization of power (like Bitcoin providing "decentralization of the printing press").

@_date: 2014-12-20 16:08:09
Counterparty is a nice platform for some things, like smart contracts, betting etc... but if the only thing you are interested in are user-issued assets, colored coins have a much simpler set of consensus rules, which means easier to implement, easier to validate there is no problem in the protocol, more stable over time, etc...
So it makes it a better choice (as in "simpler is better") assuming you're only interested in user issued assets (which Reddit, presumably is).
@_date: 2014-11-13 15:10:16

You're probably not an engineer. People building alternate implementations for Bitcoin are already struggling to achieve consensus, even though the protocol much better defined than XCP, and hasn't changed since Satoshi.
Mastercoin tried to have multiple implementations but could never get them to be in consensus. The same would happen if someone tried to make a second implementation of XCP.


Exactly my point, they're all based on the same implementation Counterpartyd.
@_date: 2014-03-14 16:22:30
Abdominal comparison as well.
@_date: 2014-05-26 13:24:02
Open Assets/Coinprism *is* a variation of colored coins: 
The definition of colored coins is a system that relies only on Bitcoin, and uses outputs (not addresses) to store value. So Coinprism is colored coins, just an improved version of the initial proposal (which can't really work, by the way, coloring actual satoshis doesn't really scale).
From a technical standpoint, it is much closer to colored coins than to mastercoin and counterparty.

No it's just that the instant 25 BTC reward vastly outweighs the vague need for a higher transactions throughput, especially that if they don't include any transaction in the block, they know that someone else will.
It's the optimal behavior for any given miner. Simple game theory.

Let me inform you first of all that Bitcoin cannot go bankrupt.
Second, no. Imagine an airport during the holidays. Millions of people are trying to catch a plane, but the TSA will only have one single agent do the security checks. If you don't want to miss your plane, just get the priority queue. And by the way, the place in the priority queue is sold on auction to the best bidder.
Oh, and don't worry. The TSA won't add more agents, however they are currently working on a new machine that will scan people shoes so that they won't have to take them off anymore, that will ensure the queue moves slightly faster. It will be ready in about a year.

@_date: 2016-06-14 23:58:22
It is very relevant, because it will prove that assumption wrong.
It's insane to assume segwit will be enough to match the transaction volume growth. It needs to be deployed by every single wallet provider to take full effect. BIP 16 took 2 years after release to get significant adoption. And even if it got deployed much faster, that would only be a gain of about 80% in throughput. Simple math show the volume grows faster than that - and we're already at 110% or 120% capacity.
And regarding LN, they will be far from ready in a year, let alone 6 months.

Not true. *Bitcoin's blockchain* is slow, cumbersome and inefficient. And it's not because of it being a blockchain, it's because of proof of work, which bankchain doesn't use. A block chain is just a data structure, it doesn't have to be slow and inefficient.
@_date: 2015-08-06 18:54:09
It's sad to say, but if you want to build something on top of the Bitcoin blockchain, you pretty much need the permission of the core developers. Bitcoin is **not** a foundation for permissionless innovation.


Banks are contractually, and legally obligated to validate transaction they authorize. By letting anonymous miners decide which transactions are valid and which aren't, they break the law. They only way they can operate legally is by verifying all the transactions, i.e. being the only miner, i.e. using a completely centralized technology.


I got news for you: a Blockchain is much more expensive than running a centralized system. You have to subsidize the miners. If we're talking about millions of transactions a day, you'll be paying miners a significant amount of money, for a service you don't even need.
@_date: 2015-08-14 09:46:51
Yes you are right, but unfortunately, this subreddit has turned into a cult of decentralization. Most here have forgotten than decentralization is not a goal in itself, it's a mean to an end.
For some use cases, like the ones banks care about, decentralization is not a desirable characteristics. Otherwise, they'd just drop the dollar and use Bitcoin instead. Why people think banks have any interest in doing that is beyond me.

Everybody agrees it's a store of value, they just think it's a bad one, or they're not interested in it.
They're however interested in the Blockchain, and in that case the only relevance of Bitcoin the currency is that "bitcoin is the denomination used to pay the toll to put stuff on the blockchain".
@_date: 2015-07-28 14:53:13


Like everybody keeps saying around here, you can't have a Blockchain without Bitcoin. Well, the corollary is that if you don't need Bitcoin (or more generally, a decentralized asset), then you don't need a Blockchain.
If you have a "real-world" asset with a digital representation (precious metals, stocks, bonds, etc...), then a database is a much better choice than a Blockchain.


That's not true, you can have a centralized immutable public ledger. It is still as centralized and as immutable as the blockchain. The thing you cannot have with a database is censorship resistance. But for most other types of assets, there already is another vector of censorship (the custodian). So making the ledger censorship-resistant is useless.

You don't need a network effect with factom. Bank of America doesn't need to store their document's hashes in the same factom chain as wells fargo. They might as well have each their own factom chains, both anchored to the BTC blockchain.

They've already looked at counterparty and pretty much dismissed it: 
@_date: 2015-04-01 23:22:01
If Bank of America really wants to use Factom (like they like to pretend), they will certainly run a private copy of Factom and not pay any factoid.
All they need is publish one merkle root per block, which runs about $100 per month in *Bitcoin* transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-04-02 20:51:38
"App coins" is the new fancy name for a license fee.
Except license fees don't work so well with open source. As long as people won't understand this, the Mastercoin/Factom mafia will make money from them.

Factom is great. The token they sell you "factoid" is worthless.

Yes, strictly speaking real-world computers are not Turing machines.
The main difference is that in a normal computer, you can generally assume your algorithm will not be interrupted. With Ethereum, you can't take that assumption as it depends on an input (how much fees are paid).

Storing data vs storing hashes, the argument the article makes applies equally to both.
But you're right Factom is even more useless as it doesn't even store data (which is the hard part).
@_date: 2015-04-01 23:11:08


Storing it on a decentralized system achieves practically nothing.

You don't need the network effect with factom.

The purpose of smart contracts is to automate settlement, not necessarily remove trust in settlement. In 99% of cases, it's fine to have a trusted third party. See how much money flows through credit cards (which are also smart contracts) versus how much flows through Bitcoin.
Even ethereum doesn't remove trust in settlement. You are still trusting a small number of miners to correctly execute the contract.

@_date: 2015-10-29 23:48:29
Yeah, with the small difference that CompuServe wasn't 10,000 times more scalable than the actual internet.

So... 75% of people don't care about privacy?
Sounds about right.

Segwit will take years post-activation to produce a meaningful effect. Mark my words.

Right, but it's escrow, so it's still a smart contract according to your definition
@_date: 2015-03-20 20:53:25
Colored coins (unlike XCP and MSC) can work with payment channels.
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:45:22
So 21inc causes wallets to use abnormally high fees, which causes 21inc to display even higher fees.
@_date: 2015-10-12 18:20:07
That's even more worrying. In a democratic process, core devs would let node administrators set the command line parameter if they feel spam is an issue, instead of changing the default unilaterally for everyone.

Well yeah, except Satoshi didn't use PGP.

Uh, no. He owns the facilities in China where he rents out the space and cheap electricity, he doesn't actually own the rigs.
@_date: 2015-10-26 12:14:39
Yes you're right. But my point still holds.
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:26:23


No. You (and the author) don't understand the difference between PoW and Blockchain. A blockchain is just a data structure. What enabled value settlement between untrusted parties is PoW.

Yes the union of these 5 exchanges is the central party.
@_date: 2015-10-23 22:59:44
I've never paid a higher price by using a credit card than if I had paid in cash. In fact, this would be against the merchant agreement.
Similarly, I've never received a discount for paying for something in Bitcoin. I always paid the same price I would have paid using a credit card. Factoring in the transaction fee, I actually ended up paying more by paying in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-03 22:12:36
Sorry to destroy your fantasy world but:
1. Android is a very long way from replacing Windows PCs.
2. Android's UX is terrible, people who are not tech savvy struggle with it. Hell, even me who is pretty savvy, last time I had to use one, I spent 10 minutes searching for how to send a frigging text message. Android is lower in customer satisfaction than both Apple AND Windows Phone.
3. Chrome OS is terrible, even Google employees hate it.
4. Circling back to the original topic of this discussion, Android's security is horrendous. It's not gonna take long before there are entire botnets running exclusively on Android.

@_date: 2015-10-23 23:12:26
Sure, but clearly there is a hole in your theory, or Bitcoin would already have taken over credit cards. We're seeing the opposite: a declining number of merchants accepting Bitcoin.

Lightning network is not a silver bullet, it's a semi-centralized solution.
@_date: 2015-10-22 11:26:40
Apparently some people are still using blockchain.info
@_date: 2017-05-31 23:32:54
That's not how LN work. You first open a channel, which may go through one or several hubs. Opening the channel results in an on-chain transaction. Once this is done, you transact as much as you want on the channel "for free".
Up until this point, everything is fine. The problems start when you try to close the channel and get your money back. Any intermediary hub can refuse to close the channel, in which case you have to wait for timeout, which may be several months.

Following that logic, antibiotics don't provide the benefits of the Bitcoin blockchain, so they're just a waste of resources and money.

Well this shows people are willing to pay a little extra money for the added services you don't get with autonomous decentralized systems (support, fraud prevention, agent reviews, etc...).

Let's be realistic for a second. People get malware mostly downloading pirated software. If Linux was a mainstream OS and people were downloading pirated software for Linux, they'd be getting malware all the same.
Obviously most of the useful commercial software does not exist on Linux, that's why the problem doesn't present itself.
@_date: 2015-10-28 12:18:07
It's funny how they use censorship to (supposedly) keep Bitcoin censorship resistant.
@_date: 2015-10-24 18:27:12
Lol, you must be living in 2014.
@_date: 2015-10-23 10:23:44
Blockchain.info runs bitcoind 0.7, so who knows what kind of errors that could be.
Use a proper block explorer, see if the error still exists, then ask your question again.
@_date: 2015-10-02 12:41:57
The problem is the people, not the OS.
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:40:18
Fees haven't gone 100x up, they've gone 10,000x up.

Somehow, you forgot Facebook and Twitter in that list.
@_date: 2015-10-15 11:26:54
That's their whole business model.

Sorry to be that guy, but what does this have to do with him having commit access?
He thinks Wright is Satoshi, is he not entitled to his opinion?
Is this what Bitcoin has become?
@_date: 2015-10-15 11:16:17
Let's put it that way: properly written database software can sustain a crash or even power loss at any point in time without any loss of consistency.
(On any OS, BTW)
This is typically achieved with a write-ahead log.
@_date: 2016-05-08 20:51:12
No that does not implicate that, because he never used it.


@_date: 2015-10-24 10:35:19
You mean like pretty much every other bank in the world?
@_date: 2017-05-16 21:46:30
Let me rephrase: by the time the price went 100x up, fees have gone 50,000x up.
By the time Bitcoin hits $3000, we'll be paying $10 fees per transaction, and by the time it hits $5,000, we'll be paying $500 transaction fees.
@_date: 2015-10-15 11:02:28
I don't know if that's more offensive to Windows users or to women.
@_date: 2017-05-16 23:48:47
Your fee is too low. You need to pay 3 times that.
@_date: 2015-03-29 05:16:30
That's still a pretty solid DoS attack vector. You can easily bankrupt someone.
@_date: 2015-03-20 03:50:42
So what? It's a non-transparent smart contract, but a smart contract nonetheless.
@_date: 2015-10-18 22:03:58
Don't worry. It's only going to be in an undetermined state for an undetermined amount of time.
@_date: 2017-07-04 14:51:29
It depends how underpriced your uncle-to-aunt rate is. I would suggest applying my replace-wife-with-fee algorithm to reduce it by ~0.00000002% given an optimum hashpower superannuation.
@_date: 2017-07-05 12:09:05
The ability to fork is what makes Bitcoin decentralized. If you want to avoid forks, you might as well use PayPal.
@_date: 2017-05-12 09:30:44
And neither do you.
That's the opposite, fees would almost not drop at all. The only way fees would drop dramatically is if blocks aren't full anymore.
@_date: 2015-10-31 00:13:25
Yes there is, you just need to think outside the box a little bit more.
@_date: 2015-03-21 07:11:26


Coming from a guy who thinks ad hominem attacks are smart.

Are you one of those realistic people? Go away, this is @_date: 2015-10-12 20:53:00
No, what I mean is why do core devs want to change the default in the code instead of simply issuing guidance, and let the users decide for themselves?
@_date: 2015-10-28 15:45:54
They've actually been around for close to 40 years.
Similarly, IRC has been around for two decades at least, yet a 2013 company (Slack) can reimplement it, and be valued a $2.5 billion.
Tablets have existed for at least 10 years before the iPad, and yet the iPad was a huge success.
The fact that blockchains are not new is essentially irrelevant.
@_date: 2015-03-20 06:07:05


Oh, I'm sorry, I hadn't realized you were the authority deciding what the Official Definition of a smart contract is.
I'm baffled that you cannot see that 99% of people don't give a sh*t about how the contract is enforced. All they care is that they get what they ordered (or their money back). Decentralized smart contracts are a solution in search of a problem.
@_date: 2015-10-23 01:07:35
Because there is already a standard for client side authentication called SSL, and it's supported by all browsers.
@_date: 2015-10-24 10:16:57
I think you're the one being naive here. You have to admit the consumer experience is quite bad when paying with Bitcoin: you end up paying more (except in some rare cases), you have no consumer protection, it takes longer. I'm not even talking about the pathological cases where transactions don't confirm because of congestion or insufficient fees or malleability attacks. 
Whenever I have the option to pay in Bitcoin, I always prefer paying in credit card. First I get 1% cash back, I know I get better protection, and I don't have to worry about the exchange rate.
And most of the people I know who are into Bitcoin do the same.
It's far from the clear win-win situation you seem to describe.
@_date: 2015-10-22 22:01:17
Just pointing out that there are very few people in the world that feel this is important. Just have a look at online "centralized" collectible card games like Hearthstone, counting millions of players (yes, more than the total number of Bitcoin users).
Players complain about a lot of things, but what you said isn't one of them.
And by the way, Blizzard prevents people from trading cards because that ruins the gameplay (aka pay to win).

Yes they can certainly lock up funds once you have opened a channel that is routed through them and you have started transacting.
And regarding anonymity, yes, that's the theory. In practice, hubs like Coinbase will require you to have a Coinbase account to use them.

Well now it's vulnerable to collusion between your competitors.
@_date: 2017-05-31 17:26:02
Yeah, but it's hypocritical to say larger blocks cause centralization and at the same time advocate for LN, which also cause centralization (though of a different kind).
@_date: 2017-05-10 20:31:35
Yeah, we need a solution yesterday, not in 3 years.

If counterparty is a standard, where is the specification? For example, can you find a document explaining in plain english and non-ambiguous terms the format of a "rock-paper-scissors" message and how it should be interpreted?
Also, a standard assumes something stable. The counterparty protocol changes on a weekly basis. For example, if you look at the [developer update]( from 2 weeks ago, the interpretation of reissuance transactions changed.

@_date: 2017-06-17 14:53:43
That is not true. The whole point of Bitcoin is that you don't have to trust your counterparty.
Having to wait for a week (but more likely months) for unlocking your funds means LN solves nothing in terms of scalability, it's just making a different tradeoff. What we're gaining in throughput, we're losing in latency.

Given how expensive it is to open and close a channel, it's unlikely users will set the timeout to anything less than 2 or 3 months, unless you're making dozens of transactions a week.


Yes, in other words, you have to trust your intermediaries, which makes LN a centralized system to some degree.

Yeah but why are you trying to get "people outside of btc" buy BTC in the first place? Is it because Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme and you desperately need new investors to come in to keep the price going up?
I think this is doing a disservice to Bitcoin. Bitcoin will grow by getting more people to use it as a payment system, by implementing new services on top of it, etc..., but getting more investors does nothing for Bitcoin except make it look like a pyramid scheme.
The price of BTC will naturally grow if the value of the underlying technology grows, not the other way around. We don't want "get rich quick" investors, we want investors who understand the power of the blockchain, and buy Bitcoin because they truly believe in it.

And the day Bitstamp or MtGox get shut down, you can expect the price to tank.
