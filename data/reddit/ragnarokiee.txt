I think you need to first read up on Bitcoin and how to use it/how it works.
Don't try to time the market. Smarter ppl than you and me have tried, and they mostly fail. Buy a set amount each week/month, don't concern yourself with short term price moves, and make sure you have a strong stomach to accommodate my for the volatility.
Good luck

No one on the internet cares how much money you have you loser
@_date: 2019-06-16 13:56:00
I'm gonna go ahead and do neither of those things. Well done for trying to act hard on the internet. You failed tho

Never really got the point of trolling but it has been fun doing it to you. Getting bored now tho so I'm gonna go. Go find the source you lazy fuck.
@_date: 2019-06-16 13:54:25
Go find the source yourself you lazy fuck

Thanks for admitting I won ��

Nice edit of your original post mate

I don't care what you believe

'below-average' is a really cringey name to call someone
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:03:33
Wow congratulations bud! You're super cool
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:14:06
Yes. It's the internet go find it out yourself holy shit. No one owes it to you to cite their sources. If you're a BSV supporter then you probably don't care about the truth anyway
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:22:47
Still edited out the part where you were a snarky prick to begin with
@_date: 2019-06-26 04:07:13
Oh for sure...super fucking rich people are always on Reddit talking about how rich they are! I totally believe you my man, congratulations!
@_date: 2019-06-26 10:44:57
No I don't. His first comment was just bragging about how he's rich and I'm not and how I wasn't there in early 2017. I responded condescendingly and then he edited his comment to make me look like a dick. 
There are clearly rich people on Reddit, but they're not going around bragging about their wealth unprompted - that's my point
@_date: 2019-06-16 14:01:24
Thanks mate glad you can admit it. Takes a lot to admit you're wrong
@_date: 2019-06-14 16:11:07
Oh give over. He's not saying he was 'part of a team'. In fact he was quoted the other week as saying that HE was Satoshi, and the few people that helped him with advice etc have no claim to the Bitcoin network as he was the dedicated developer behind it.

Find it yourself. Hate people that just say 'Source' like I owe it to you to cite my statements on a social media thread.
@_date: 2019-06-26 03:32:56
That euphoria sounds eerily similar to Dec17
@_date: 2019-09-20 15:30:12
Sorry but I think it's unnecessarily complicated. Everyone should just use Sats and keep it simple.
Bitcoin is already complicated enough to explain. Adding 6 more 'names' to describe a particular denomination of a Bitcoin seems really unnecessary and kinda cult like
