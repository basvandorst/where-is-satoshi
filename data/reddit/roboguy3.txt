If the down vote money goes to the poster we will get a lot of trolls.

Privacy has improved with mixers like shared coin and the payment protocol.
Often the regulators come to individuals in the community for advice.  I am hoping to get discussions started so when those talks happen we have good advice.

A forum runs this no up/ down vote model. I prefer Reddit since most people are good an up vote relavent content.  It is just one bad person can currently hide content without much cost.

I made a thunderbird plugin that does something similar called EmailCoinFilter.  It sends a signed transaction with emails and filters on a minimum amount.
