I'm still suck at
"Bitcoin Withdrawals are Temporarily Disabled
Please see our twitter feed for updates"

Why the OP got down voted is beyond me.  It sounded like a legit question.   How would he answer those questions tho ?  "Yeah I'm buying and selling Bitcoin. Oh you're going to freeze my account now to make it impossible for me to continue? Greaaaaat"

I thought the exact same thing earlier today when I saw the two posts.   Mozilla = all over Reddit apparently

sorry for not mailing an IOU
....sorry again.

So far the service has been great.  Is there another reason I shouldn't use it?  I checked to see if it was saved as a draft and that isn't even an option.

How does a Canadian go about diversifying and getting onto a China BTC exchange?

This is from earlier on today.  They had a couple notices on the site about this when they first launced LTC trading.

Is it not optional?
I thought they stated that if you didn't provide full info then you would be restricted from certain dollar/BTC amount movement.

Ahh the fake deposit receipts.  Yeah I always verify that there is actual cash in my account. If I recall, OP just went ahead and released the BTC without making sure he had received the cash. Thanks for the input tho

I did too...this morning

I think you are a little mistaken.  If you walk into a bank and deposit money into a bank account using a number you were given, there is little hope in hell that you will ever get that money back. Why would the bank let you withdraw money from someone else's bank account? That defeats the whole purpose of it being YOUR account. 
Now if it were an electronic deposit, through EFT or Interac E-Transfer, then yes, you are correct it can be reversed, but I do not accept those for exactly that purpose.

Doesn't matter though. They haven't updated anything for the last 7 hours. I DM'd them but I never get a response. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:05:30
This is my primary exchange...
@_date: 2014-02-26 04:57:08
Expected to be up within 2 hours.

Sell at least half of it and convert at least 2/3 of that to something else like a TFSA. Keep the rest in a savings account just in case. 
As for the computer and guitar, save up and wait to buy it. 
I'm not cheap by any means, it's just that you have ALL of your eggs in one delicate basket.

The one comment you are referring to caught my attention, but I do bring to light the other comments in that thread. They seem to be quite the discussion piece.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:14:26
I just tuned in about 5 mins ago. What have I missed? 
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:31:57
oh man....just STAHP ALREADY! nobody believes your shit
@_date: 2013-11-19 12:54:50
Ohh, I have no intention on investing in anything else, I was just hoping to stir a discussion and hear people's thoughts 
@_date: 2013-11-16 04:49:18
We all need to just calm the fuck down here.
@_date: 2013-11-19 21:18:05
Reddit plug, woohoo!
