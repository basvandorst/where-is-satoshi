From what i've read regarding mining, unless you can invest sh1tloads of money to get a proper mining rig it is not efficient in terms of power consumption vs productivity.

Bring back the 19,000 price and you’ll see how many will HODL ...

Pretty sure it’s going to be 200.000 by the end of the year. No, wait it’s going to be 500.000. Never mind, the crystal ball was leaking. It’s 1.000.000 instead. Fuck, that weed was faulty too. It’s going to be 5.000.00. Now go sell your house and buy BTC just cause some random guy across the Internet said so. Retards everywhere ...

There are silly people everywhere. If they don’t read up before acting it’s as much (well not as much as the deceiver but you get my point) their fault.
We had a guy here in Greece claiming that he was holding 600 billion dollars in bonds. Long story short he is in jail now and people might lose their properties because they were trying to pay their tax debts with this non existent money.

I made a withdrawal about a month ago and it was almost instant. Then about a week ago I purchased some more during the dip and sent again to my ledger. That one took close to 2 hours to validate. I would not worry too much (unless you made an error to your wallet address or something). Give it some time.

Any idea why Coinbase website is down ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:35:55
Depends on what you are trying to do. Play the markets by buying low and selling high ? Or just buying as an investment asset ?

If you have nothing to fear stop spreading bullshit and unless you endorse it enjoy the ride along.

I could claim otherwise, but the correct thing to say is: “my opinion is that ...”

"Young people should use their many talents and skills for innovation, not reinventing money. It's a fallacy to think money can be created from nothing,”
I stopped reading there.
