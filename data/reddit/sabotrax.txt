No hot wallet on a reasonably secured pc should carry more than the amount one can get over losing.
The rest should be put in a wallet capable of doing cold storage (like Electrum) or a paper wallet.
Also should a fully patched Windows 7 oder 8.x be OK, pirated or not. Linux is more secured but there are other attack vectors than specially crafted viruses looking for private Bitcoin keys while having a key logger running fishing for your wallet password. If you're like me and keep talking a lot to people about Bitcoin, someone just could have watched you typing your password and copied the wallet to a USB stick later on.
I suspect a lot more like this to come.

There a "fat" and "thin" wallets. The official client works on a local copy of the blockchain and for that is fat. Thin clients use SPV (Simple Payment Verification) and are using other nodes to process transactions over the network (see 
For Android, there is the Schildbach Wallet and Mycelium. Both have support for private key backup. Mycelium also has support for "Watch Only" wallets.

Yes, but do not forget that there are two sides of this medal. Not only gives Bitcoin more Power over your own money, but also wants more responsibilty. Feeling sorry for the OP anyhow.

Yes. I think it has all the basic features. Just create an account on Kyle's site 
I'm also running an installation on a VPS located in Germany. The server is  (self signed SSL certificate).

I guess there won't be much effect as the scammers would, after some laundering, just keep the most coins.

You could download a live CD of Ubuntu Linux from [ubuntu.com]( Then boot your Laptop from the CD and see if you could get a printer cheap to work.
After that, visit [bitaddress.org]( or [bitcoinpaperwallet.com]( for nicer wallets. Both sites work offline (bitcoinpaperwallet.com needs to be downloaded from Github), so you should disconnect from the network after the site has been loaded into the browser.
Create the paper wallet, print it out, put it in a ziploc bag so it's secured against humidity.
You can add extra irony by placing the wallet in a safe deposit box of your bank.

At least they look for your IP to stay the same during an active session. Which is good.
I tried to conntect using TOR today and they kicked me out every 10 minutes or so when the TOR Circuit renewed and I got a new exit IP.
They also have a field where you can add your PGP key for they would send you encrypted email. Though I can't confirm.
