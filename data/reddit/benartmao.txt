Im going to try the "easiest " way first. My friend invested 50 in coins and gave me 5 to use. Question about transferring tho. Because ive only been transferring with coinbase. Is there a link to how i can easily transfer the coins to people or sell it off if im on an offline wallet?

Sorry im new and i was gifted 5 BTC on coinbase. Is there a quick guide on how i can transfer this to a offline wallet?

oh okay so basically the value rose so whoever owns it wins. Question though since you are comparing to stocks. Stocks are buying a stake or % of a company but bitcoins is currency right? What is backing up the currency? I mean there has to be a tangible backing right? or the founders can just keep creating bitcoins and selling them. Does the market have a set amount or is there an entity that can create bitcoins at will.

Okay. So the person who is buying it at 300 finds that the coin is to him a value of 300. I on the other hand have made a 100 profit. If the value of the bitcoins drop he will have lost if he decides to sell where as if it rises he will make a profit. okay.. thanks!

What is Bitcoin Mining?

Sorry question seems pretty general but lets say you buy bitcoins at 1 dollar. and the value raises to 5. YOu sell the bitcoin at 5 dollars. Who is losing the 4 dollars. the new buyer?
@_date: 2013-10-29 18:20:49
your last line is under the assumption that the value of bitcoins is still to rise more right?

But if we can account for the electricity being paid for, the largest portion of the cost of mining ( other then the actual equipment ) is accounted for right? As in there would be a higher profit margin.

is it really stealing electricity? i mean its technically paid for ahahaha
