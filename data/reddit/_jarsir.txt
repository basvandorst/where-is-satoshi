This guy gets it! 
You are investing in a new technology that has a chance to change the world, but it is just that, a CHANCE. If we take a look at history, those who control the money and power do not tend to give it up without a fight. Invest responsibly and do not gamble your life away on a whim.

Are you saying the rent won’t cover the taxes?

Should have went to Funfair’s casinofair where you can prove fair odds and maintain control of your crypto until the exact point the bet resolves.

In your hypothetical scenario. It would flip on its head...Measure the value of fiat in bitcoin not bitcoin in fiat. Because people only want to accept a currency they think will store value...

False

Lots to comment on in that statement but just waking up and don’t have the energy atm ...but, at a minimum they would need to find people willing to sell bitcoin for USDT so that is a limiting factor

When mass adopted...Bitcoin isn’t fluctuating, it is the fiat currency that is.
In simple people in the future would trust Bitcoin more than the currency of their country.

What is this 40 billion per month unwinding you are talking about? The money being paid back to the fed from the QE loans? Also, Is that 40billion being destroyed or is it still part of the money supply, because it was created out of thin air?
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:18:56
So when the fed bought failing MBS from 2008-2012 or so with the QE money (inflating money supply)...they took on an asset they knew was losing tons of money. They did so to save the financial system from collapsing and the banks...yes, they are unwinding that balance sheet... but that doesn’t change the fact that there is still an increase in the money supply, by 700billion dollars created out of thin air.  
So in a very overly simplified hypothetical example if there was 700billion usd before QE, after QE each dollar lost 50% of its purchasing power. And since the 700 billion is not being removed from the money supply this would still be true today...Wondering if you agree with this comment?

Right ‘something’ always happens 
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:54:20
Right they make a new bank account and then decide $700 billion dollars are in it.  See below:
Account start up question:
 “how much money would you like your new bank account to have?”  
Fed analyst types: 
7...0...0...0...0...0...0...0....0...hmmm....Fuck it ....000. 
Confirmation page:
Congrats on opening a new account!!!!: Balance $700,000,000,000. And, No printing was necessary!!

He just drew a random line on a random chart

Price predictions are like assholes. Everyone has them and they all stink. 
You are entitled to an opinion,  but you, just like everyone that predicts prices of crypto, stocks, etc, are saying you know best. You know how everyone in the world thinks and that you are basically clairvoyant.  
You either believe in or don’t believe in the technology and those working to advance it or squash it. That is the only decision you need to make. Stop contributing to the problem by spewing nonsensical price predictions

Read a economics 101 book or you are going to get hurt trading crypto

You will absolutely need to still pay annual property taxes for any real estate you buy. But, If your question is about the capital gains taxes from converting a crypto where you have substantial gains to real estate I would seek a tax accountant that specializes in RE/Crypto. As much as I would love to know the answer to this question i am not sure that clear regulation will exist atm. If you could convert crypto to property with out triggering a capital gains tax that would be an awesome incentive for use and invest in crypto.

This is a stupid comment and a stupid idea. You are using them as a lottery ticket...Invest only what you can afford to lose. 
And even if bitcoin was to jump to an extreme value, where you could retire by owning a couple of them,  you would not want to convert back to fiat. B/c a jump to that valuation would require an end of markets as we know them (size) event
