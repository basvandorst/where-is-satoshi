I pretty much agree with everything you've said.
Lets just forget every other coin for a second. I have a roughly equal list of of pros and contras for both BTC and BCH. Therefore, I am not going to dump one over the other until I know more. You've mentiond a few contras for BCH so I'll add some from the other side to give a little balance. I have a major issue with lightning and would like to see how that is going to be implemented and I think Blockstream still haven't got a coherent solution to scaling a decentralised currency. I also have major concerns about Blockstream itself which I won't go into here.

Everyone is capable of keeping two sets of books, Roger will be no different. He says the things he says for the same reason people come on here and tell others that bitcoin cash is a scam and a joke and it's worthless. Because its in their interests to do so.
I'm glad you've got a good head on your shoulders. you'll come out of this better than most.

Do we want the layer above though? I don't think so. High fees is not a reason to centralise. High fees is a reason to move to another coin, centralisation is a reason to move to another coin. We can all be led down a blind alley by what is a small portion of the community or we can choose another way.

I completely agree with you but personally I can also make a similar list of reasons why Bitcoin isnt the one and only horse to back. I think the most will feel the same. I'll be keeping hold of both my Bitcoin coins (cash and core), for now, I will sell one or both in the future at a time that suits me and for my reasons. I hope you do the same. I certainly won't be selling them just because someone else says its fake or a scam or even because Roger Ver is a dick! I think Adam Back is dick too!
In the world of crypto, these are early days and the one that moves forward to conquer the world probably isn't even with us yet.
I wouldn't say backing your horse so early when all the data is yet to come in is smart investing at all! To suggest that someome who has decided to keep hold of both hasn't done their research or isn't smart investing is a bit silly! Unless you know the future of course??? If so a PM would be nice.

If you want to make a point I'll discuss it with you. If you are just going to babble nonsense and belittle what someone else has said without actually adding something to the debate then your interjection is a waste of time.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:03:26
I disagree with what you are saying entirely. 
Was facebook the one and only? Nothing came before? When what came before was no more did people reject the concept or did they jump to the better product / platform?
Blockchain is what matters the most. Bitcoin is possibly in a bubble 
that could pop. 
I re-read my post, I can't see any wishes in there. Nope, can't see one! Just a bit of realism in what could be. You can have an opinion on that but you can't refute it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:27:14
That's great if you feel that way but most don't. Most are holding because the safest thing they can do is to hedge their bets.
Why, because they don't believe in one over the other.

UDEMY will literally give you a certificate for anything!
Even when they aren't authorised to do so! A UDEMY certificate means nothing in the real world but it makes the people who give them money feel a bit better about the shitty course they have just bought!

The original premise of bitcoin was for everybody in the world to use cheaply and easily. It was intended to take control away from the priviliged. I think you may have bought the wrong coin!
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:51:14
One single thing that is more energy efficient than mining is not actually mining. No one really needs to do it and the people who do are in it for profit. Turning electricity into money is not energy efficient at all! Maybe cost effective but most certainly not energy efficient.

Bitcoin isn't owned by anybody. Bitcoin is a social experiment and Roger is entitled to use the phrase as much as he wants. The code behind it is free for us all to use, if we wish, and we can all call our own versions bitcoin if we want.
Why does that even bother you? 
Imo, getting rid of something that may have more value in the future and that costs you nothing and no hardship to keep is madness, absolute madness. It's the mentality of a fanboy!
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:32:46
There are loads of cryptos that offer more than others. I have my fingers in lots of pies.
If you wanted to invest your money in the best product you would not choose Bitcoin Core or Bitcoin Cash. You would also have probably put your cash in betamax and lost it all. The best product doesn't always come out on top. History has repeatedly taught us that.

Jihan holds the best hand. It's just a question of when will he play it!
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:12:44
The irony is that we have groups of vested interest vying for control. Not the original intention at all.

I never said it has no place, or that it's not worth backing. You may want to re-read.
There are a number of coins worth holding in my view and of course I've done my research (you certainly jump to assumptions). Just because I see negatives doesn't mean I should get rid. That's a silly thing to say. I see postives and negatives with lots of coins and none are perfect. If you think there is one that has no negatives about it at all then I think it's you who most certainly needs to do a little more research.
The data isn't in yet. Only a fool would suggest it is.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:35:45
No? So argue against it.
I don't think "gib gab gib" is any coherent argument at all.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:34:06
You're a very sensible person.

Because he believes that Bitcoin Cash is closer to the original bitcoin than Bitcoin Core is. It's hard to disagree with that and is the general consensus. He feels the project has been compromised, he may be right and he may be wrong.
Bitcoin is a community and movement before it is anything else. The original bitcoin was put out as freeware and was intended to be branched as the community saw fit. The community will decide on which strand it wants to move forward with and that will become the true bitcoin. I don't see why anyone has an issue with that. If someone tells you that is wrong and that Bitcoin Cash is stealing or a scam then the person telling you that has a vested interest. Bitcoin will win either way but in what form is for the community to decide.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:31:31
Being mislead about what? Bitcoin is a social experiment, it should not be owned and controlled by anyone. Anyone can use the name.
Serious question, why does it bother you?
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:24:16
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:44:01
You can keep saying that if you like. Doesn't make it true!
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:34:54
I don't understand why you think they are imposters or masquerading? 
Bitcoin is a community and it will find it's own way. If its bitcoin cash then so be it, its then bitcoin, if it's bitcoin core, then great also.
To stop this silly argument why don't we all agree to sell our bitcoin and buy bitcoin cash? We get more coins, have a way forward for the meantime.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:03:22
What if it does take over? What if you've been spun a story that isn't true? What if you've fell for the bullshit hook line and sinker?
No-one knows for certain so selling something that could one day be very valuable is a most stupid thing to do! The sensible people keep both coins which is what the majority have done. The minority are ones saying Bitcoin Cash is the future. The minority are the ones saying lightning is the way forward. The majority let them argue and sit it out until the best position becomes evident. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:28:53
I agree. Which is why it so annoying that the main parties in this won't work together.
If I have to make a decision on what kind of centralisation I prefer, I'm going to choose the miners over big business.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:56:23
Silly argument, If I did not drive my car I would not get 0 miles to the gallon because the gallon would not be used! Using energy needlessly, even if it saves more energy than another pointless use of energy is not energy efficient. Using an energy efficient lightbulb as opposed to normal lightbulb is not more energy efficient that not using the light when it isn't needed. You don't have to consume you know!
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:55:01
Not many people do. Except for the people who will substantially score out of it. Blockstream and the largest exchanges will become very rich and practically gain control. Very bad for decentralisation. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:19:05
You're welcome. Don't get me wrong, there are some good and interesting courses on UDEMY but the certificate means nothing.
FYI - There is a free Bitcoin course on UDEMY already. 6hrs long, worth it if you want to learn a bit about bitcoin and have no prior knowledge.
