I support a research area where Balaji worked and I have some very interesting wireshark dumps from his time here from the switch stack he used.  Balaji is a very forward thinker and no one should dismiss anything he says.

You can tell a lot about a start-up by who they are hiring.

The money is news worthy for sure.  It's not clear if the mining resources will be available to the lay person so it is too early to call that, but as a bitcoin adopter myself, I have been praying for a profit\investor driven mining operation to pop-up domestically that will help ensure the network.  If they can find a way to integrate miners into everyday appliances that are connected to the internet, that could be huge.  There could be all kinds of side benefits and offers(added value) if you bought a TV that had a built-in miner.  Say you buy a TV that has a miner built-in and by just having it on and connected, your 21 account accumulated points you can spend on offers or maybe even cash out to BTC or whatever.  Just a thought..

I am very excited to see what 21 does!

uTorrent did it without consent and the consumer was not in a position where they would benefit in any way.  
  
You would know you were buying a Sony TV that was partnered with 21 and that your 21 account would receive benefits in some way.  I totally fabricated that example with Sony but it's just an example.
  
We need more than just miners to keep the block chain alive, we need distribution as widely as possible so that no one entity can take over the network and abuse it.

Oh, I think it is much more than just selling ASIC miners.  I believe they are planning to bring to market offerings that will emotionally invest consumers in the health of the bitcoin network(and maybe other networks down the road).  Right now, miners are fragmented and average people aren't invested in it, most people could care less.  If you can hook consumers on mining through rewards(not necessarily btc rewards), you can build a very powerful army of consumers that will advocate for you and support you while ensuring the network and your investments in it.

ASIC Miners.  The VC funding them are also heavily invested in non-mining bitcoin start-ups and the ecosystem in general so it is in their best interest to invest in companies that will also support the network and ensure the underlying needs.  I think they're going to make a play for a big chunk of the hashing power so they have more of a voice and to help protect their existing investments.

If you want to make informed decisions, you're going to have to go work for it, I don't work for you.

I bet they are looking at every angle they can, mine was just an obvious example of how they could bring mining benefits to consumers.

It's all good.  
  
I think it is a lot of different factors.  Some people see it as good news equals adoption while others see the big investment numbers as validation for their beliefs and the decisions they have made.  There are a lot of reasons for it that aren't necessarily driven by data, there is a lot of excitement and emotion when it comes to bitcoin and its potential.

Specifically, what are you asking me to source?
@_date: 2015-03-11 16:27:31
It was just an example.  I'm assuming that 21 will be working very hard to make their chips as energy efficient as possible, so lets see what they can do, it's all just speculation until we have data.

Sounds like more than just mining to me too!  That's why I came up with the appliance idea that is somehow connected to your 21 account.  21 could acquire/partner with many different companies like groupon for instance and come up with incentives and offers.  Maybe your internet connected household appliances could some day buy you a vacation.
