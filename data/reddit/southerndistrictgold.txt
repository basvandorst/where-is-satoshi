Now you have the opportunity to focus on this. You definitely should if it's what you love!

Hi. I know a lot about this case too..
Where did they first talk to you? Was it at your house? Airport? 
Did you admit to them that you did this when they first started talking or did you keep quiet until you had a lawyer?
What was the evidence they had against you besides addresses? You said you destroyed everything because you had already quit. I don't get why you were charged if they only had addresses.

Sorry to hear that.  I wish you had gotten an attorney before speaking with them. It's good that you seem to have bettered yourself since everything happened, though, so good on you. I hope that you are successful in whatever else you choose.
As for me, just to share since I was in a similar position: 2 feds approached me at an airport. They really wanted me to speak with them about gold himself because I had given them an address under my control but not to myself exactly. They were telling me that the vendor kept detailed records. I said I didn't want to speak to them about this unless I had a lawyer. They were mad and tried to intimidate but I stayed calm and talked calmly. I admitted to nothing and they gave me a business card, saying to have my lawers contact them. I hired extremely expensive lawyers. They talked to the main agent on the case who said they traced all the transactions to darknet markets. Luckily for me, the feds obviously didn't have much because the lawyers recently gave me my huge retainer back after dealing with this since mid last year. It was mentally damaging and caused me to feel extremely paranoid, anxious, and depressed until it was over. Most important lesson: If doing anything even remotely illegal, take opsec extremely seriously. I'm lucky to say I still have a large stash of crypto, and they never got any of the cash that gold sent me either. No more illegal activities for me. Life is good now without it, although I did have fun at the time.

Vendor was completely aware. Gold, the vendor, got caught first. The feds let him continue his operation as normal so his customers would not suspect anything so they (the feds) could come after his customers later.

That sucks.  Hope you can get some quality rest tonight!

How were your sleeping arrangements while locked up in all of the places? Could you sleep? Were you always tired? 
This is what I was most concerned about but not sure if it was a valid concern.

That's an awesome story, reminds me of Tony Bosch, an illegal steroid dealer that opened up a medical clinic in Miami and worked with guys like A-rod ( 
[Screwball is a good documentary about this]( 
Your life is more much interesting than a normal person's life and I don't think you should be ashamed of it in any way. I'm sure you could use a lot of the knowledge you gained around these topics (fitness, steroids, pharmaceuticals, crypto) to profit in the legal world.

He did business with a compromised vendor. The feds let gold (the vendor) operate as normal while they gathered customer information such as names and addresses. The feds used that information to build their cases and make arrests. He technically snitched on himself.
@_date: 2019-11-18 14:34:45






We don't know this. He admitted to everything as soon as they approached him. If he had an attorney present, he might never have had to give up as much as he did, but it was his choice to make and he seems to have bettered himself since so good on him I guess.
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:23:41


They were trying to do that to me too. They said they knew about "the transactions and the contraband", started showing me papers and pictures of cash. I didn't even want to look at it, so I didn't. 
How are you feeling now? Also, how old are you? (give or take 5 years if you don't want to say)

Glad you're doing ok!
Wish government had to implement crypto like bitcoin into the tax system so we could analyze where our tax money goes in real time to prevent these lazy government employees from stealing it, amongst other things.
Good luck in there!

Unfortunately he said he talked to the feds and admitted to everything before hiring an attorney. He could have potentially avoided a lot of this if he had not talked.
@_date: 2019-11-17 23:35:10


He said he did get out first but also said in another post that he admitted to the feds that he did what he did when they asked, before hiring a lawyer. If anyone else is reading, NEVER TALK TO THE FEDS WITHOUT AN ATTORNEY PRESENT!
@_date: 2019-11-18 14:40:21


which is why i try to use it as much as possible. hopefully more people will do the same.
@_date: 2019-11-18 14:32:43


He admitted to everything as soon as they approached him. He does not know what would have really happened if he didn't offer everything to them because he never tried. He made a BIG mistake and talked to the feds without an attorney. He should never have done this, but it was his choice.

Anything can hurt your body when taken in excess, even water! 
You shouldn't be so hard on yourself. You weren't doing anything wrong unless you were intentionally adulterating your product line / ripping people off. It's just business at the end of the day. There's many types of businesses out there. I think you should talk to a professional therapist about this to help you let go of this stuff and to show you that it's not wrong to do what you did.

If you were Budweiser, Marlboro, Pfizer, or another large corporation you would not be thinking this way. 
I think that you were doing a good thing.  You were providing a service. If you were successful, you were obviously making people happy in some way. The laws are stupid. People should be able to do whatever they want, even if it's harmful to oneself. (we're legally allowed to skydive for example, which is risky, why can't we legally alter our minds and bodies in the comfort of our own homes (which is less risky)?)
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:00:18


Exactly! It will work out if you believe it will work out!  Wish more people had this attitude!
@_date: 2019-11-17 22:15:37


I agree. These people take huge risks to make society a better place. The vendors who got in and out early and also kept their coins deserve their current riches.
@_date: 2019-11-18 14:27:20


what's this have to do with anything? i'm talking about the risks of taking substances at home vs the risk of dangerous activities like skydiving (or anything else: bungee jumping, horseback riding, etc.).
