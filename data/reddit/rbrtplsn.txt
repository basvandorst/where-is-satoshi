How about an organized Thunderclap to coordinate delivery of tips to a few charities/prominent people?  (Maybe ChangeTip should build out Thunderclap-like functionality into their system .

I sent $5. Ask ice bucket challenge how a bunch if $5-10 donations worked out for them. How much did you send?

You can count me in with whatever you have planned. I'm all for raising awareness thru coordinated action.

I've had the same experience with unclaimed tips. This week I'll donate again, and add a  tag.  Leading horses.

Circle made 4 small deposits into my bank account, rather than 2 deposits and 2 withdrawals. Bitcoin bank error in my favor??

I completely agree and have tried tipping over 15 non-r/bitcoin people/groups over the last few weeks (mainly thru ChangeTip on Twitter).  I've tipped charities, bloggers with posts I've liked and some friends.  Somewhat surprisingly, only a few have actually collected their tips...

Idea: It's understandable that Charities may be reticent to accept micro donations from pseudonymous donors (especially when the donation is coming through the internet and is denominated in bitcoin).  How about an option to create a verified identify for charitable giving, possibly leveraging the KYC work of Coinbase and Circle?  Users who sign up for “ChangeTip Charitable” would consent to sharing their identity with the charitable organization as requested. 
 
To take it a step further, what if ChangeTip set up “ChangeTip Charitable” as a 501(c)(3) Donor Advised Fund.  Charities would see the DAF as the donor, while users would be able to recognize an upfront charitable donation under the tax code, while still retaining the ability to direct the distribution of funds from the account over time.

More people realize how cool it is to directly tip for good content. Here is a tip for your good work. $1 @_date: 2014-05-01 04:44:15
Yes, I wondered that too... I've tipped everything from 50 cents to $10. No claims. By the way, I don't mean to pontificate. I know everything I said above is common sense.

Thanks for posting. Super interesting talk. $1 @_date: 2014-10-20 19:41:28
Money is basically favor vouchers. You do something for someone and they give you some item (gold, seashell, signed piece of paper, etc.) that society agrees gives you the right to call in that favor owed to you, but the cool thing is it doesn't even have to be from the person you did the original favor for.
The way Bitcoin works is instead of actually passing around gold or pieces of paper to record who did what for whom, a globally synchronized accounting ledger records this data in a cryptographically secure way. Since no tokens have to be physically transported, it is global and fast. But since no central authority controls it, it cannot be politically messed with, inflated, confiscated remotely, etc.
It's like gold that weighs nothing, that you can carry in your brain without anyone knowing, and that you can teleport anywhere in the world for a tiny fee or even no fee. You can do this with a few cents or a few million dollars just the same way.

I think ChangeTip is perfect for charitable campaigns thru radio (e.g., public radio fund raisers).  So much easier to send $5 thru Twitter than thru a phone call and credit card.

I think we should do one more round focused on charities on Dec 2,

Donated to a favorite charity on Earth Day, tipped a blogger for an article I liked, bought a beer for an out of town friend. All with a couple of clicks on my phone. I'll let them decide if that is 'creepy'. 
I must be doing something right to bring out the paid shills. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:26:46
I've tipped 4 different charities (environmental charities on Earth Day, my alma mater in response to a specific fund raising event).  None of the charities have demonstrated interest in Bitcoin previously, but I found it super easy to make the donations and I thought they might be curious enough to look into collecting the tips.
I've also tipped 4 bloggers who wrote articles I liked. One guy is really well-known and probably too busy to deal with $1 tip. Another guy is an author who has written favorable posts on BTC. I thought he would collect it, but he hasn't yet... The others I thought would collect because micro-tips for content could really support their businesses. I guess they just don't see the potential. 
Finally, I tipped an out of town friend a beer on his b-day. I sent him a separate email to explain what it was... But, he hasn't collected it yet. Go figure. 
I dont read too much into it all. It's a new technology and probably the first time these people have come across change tip and BTC. I know I dismissed BTC the first few times I heard of it. When I finally took the time to look into it, I haven't looked back.

Send them Bitcoin via ChangTip on Twitter?  If enough people do that, they might make the effort to claim it.

 is Dec 2. We should use TippingTuesday to show how micro donations work, and encourage charities to activate their ChangeTip accounts by Dec 2.

I just sent them a small donation via ChangeTip on Twitter. Money Sans Frontiers. 
@_date: 2014-05-01 04:11:29
Thanks for the tip. From my perspective (as the tipper), I find the interface intuitive. I just joined twitter, only because I wanted to try this tip function, and I figured it out pretty easily (and I'm not tech savvy). I can't comment on the tippees experience.  However, my theory is that because everyone acts out of self interest, the tippees simply do not believe it is worth their time and interest to make the claim.  Change Tip can make it as easy as possible to claim the tip, but you can't make the horse drink. 
Now, if tipping on social networks like twitter became more common (and visible), the calculus could change as the blogger, charity, individual would start to believe it more likely they would receive more tips.

An active derivatives market is the last thing needed in Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-11-12 14:53:36
My concern exactly... Derivatives dilute the scarcity, and the price is then set by paper bitcoin.  Just like gold.
