Well if their experiments with Bitcoin are as successful as their Euro experiment then I'm sure this will end well for everyone, except Greece....

It's more a question of being complementary to BTC rather than advantage, not just LTC but I suspect any coin on Segwit will do well given that it will represent a new BTC centrist network. 
However, LTC does have a few things going for it:  
*   Active Ambassador for the Brand/Community aka Charlie Lee
*  Agile development environment that is also complementary to BTC...Core are ultra-conservative to protect BTC's position meaning LTC can take on code changes first to ensure perfection.
* Longevity - LTC has a proven implementation of the bitcoin protocol with an associated network of shops and services to utilize it. 
* Volume and Longevity means that LTC is a core coin recognized alongside BTC and ETH as a safe store of value...as much as can be said for crypto.
* LN is designed for smaller micro-transactions, if you need large on-chain transactions LTC is cheaper and faster, and is almost universally accepted by all exchanges. Note: That's nothing against BTC, but no coin can be an everything coin either...so LTC has some utility value against BTC in this particular circumstance.

Technology is politically agnostic...it's down to us how we use it. This technology is a Pandora's box of serious evolution of financial practices going back thousands of years, it's anonymity will allow nefarious actors to abuse people, it's integrity will allow a new era of unarguable audibility.
Only one thing is certain...it will challenge the current established order.

It's interesting that a Museum would see Bitcoin as genuinely innovative enough to display it.

The guys in the IT dept are writing the Trading software and maintaining the systems upon which all the trading relies. My friend was working trading systems in Japan and he too reported Bitcoin as being a buzz in the IT Finance circles, traders can't help but notice too as you have a completely fluid market with high volatility meaning bitcoin is the perfect honey trap for those who wish to speculate.

This shouldn't be relevant to bitcoin, but to all life in IT and computing. 
I hope you've got that sorted now, if not and the thought of organizing and remembering passwords does not appeal, you'd do well to just go and buy an existing security solution. There are plenty to choose from.

One Doge will always be One Doge but during the European currency crisis, One Greek Euro wasn't quite equal one German Euro.
The Euro still carries the structural deficiencies it displayed during the European banking crisis all they did was paper over the cracks. You really would be better off with the Doge Meme Cryptocurrency.

Bankruptcy: Liquidate everything, pay fiat to creditors, outstanding assets(ie btc etc) go to shareholders i.e. Mark and Jeb.
CR: Reinstate the company and pay out assets pro rata to the creditors meaning that unlike bankruptcy you aren't limited to the fiat valuation given at the time of bankruptcy. 
Technically, you could have another exchange take over and reboot the exchange though CR...but there seems to be no appetite to do so.
It's also worth noting that this is potentially the first bankruptcy in history where fiat creditors get their full claim and those claiming btc will get back more in fiat value than their claim was worth at the time of bankruptcy. Fiat wise I'm getting over three times more back than my original claim...but no need to point out this is cold comfort when I'm only getting 23% of my btc back.

Er! WTF!
IANAEconomist, but taking tx usd value and calling it GDP smells like bullshit to me, even more so when we already use the tx usd to measure velocity of money and network value. GDP is a measure of production, in BTC terms that would be mining effort, coding effort, entrepreneurial activity and other metrics...which is nothing like this. 
This just stinks.

Anyone here know how EU directives work and apply?
Basically the EU says do this, but you're free to implement it as you see fit in your own country. 
Two things:  
The Directive is from 2015....so it takes years for directives to roll out and be implemented in to local law.
The amounts listed in the OP are a derogation where AML/Customer identity can not be ascertained. I.E. If you really want to remain anonymous and obtain a prepaid card, you just buy it outside the EU in any case.
However, despite the OP not being as bad as seems, sadly the war on cash is real with India, EU, and the IMF now planning to get rid of cash transactions altogether....how they expect trade to occur in non networked conditions is beyond me, and I suspect there will be some major hurdles and hassle for ordinary people as they attempt to push out this ultra regulated(enslaved) vision of humanity's future. Yay, we stop corruption with the little guys while institutional corruption will continue to destroy national economies and cause harm to the global economy while the now regulated little people suffer for the sins of the financial masters of the universe. 
What a joyous vision of the future, trillions pissed down the drain on hubris while you can't even move the arbitrary and small amount of 10K which was plucked out of some wealthy bureaucrats ass on the back of a financial lobbyists whispering.

You assume that they have equal access to the jobs market as you do. And you don't exactly care for the facts of the matter either, these people are ideologically offensive to your world view. You complain about the meager sustenance supplied to them in the form of food stamps, while you ignore the sociological implications of creating an underclass that has no means to move up.

It was on the front page not so long ago, quick thinking from @_date: 2013-09-20 17:28:46
I actually agree with you there. Welfare traps are a reality, as well as inefficiencies in how systems work, adding to that the human side of things and that welfare programs can often be burdened by an overreaching bureaucracy that ends up siphoning tax money away from the targets that tax money is meant to help. This is by no means a straightforward issue, but we can't let the extremists dictate the terms and framing of the conversation.

So basically they are willing to work, and the work available isn't enough for them to not require food stamps. But you just take the broad stroke generalized position that they're sitting around doing nothing without regard to the actual facts. Again, your ideological views are eclipsing the realities of life for people you actively disdain . 


Then it isn't a society at all. At the least, and what was agreed on after the vast genocides of the 20th century was that Society at the least owes Human rights, and the basic opportunity to live with basic human fundamental requirements. That we live in an age where people can stand out and argue against these basic precepts of civilization is all too clear a symptom of our dysfunctional age. Believe it or not, it is the basic social programs that set the developed world in contrast to the developing world. 


You think all people starving in the world can get up and solve their problems as simply as just working, that by the very act it's self, food will magically manifest itself, and all the realities of the situation will just evaporate?
