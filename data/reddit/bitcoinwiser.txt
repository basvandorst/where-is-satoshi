Any case they are making a huge profit only with trade fee. Mtgox still have a trade volume higher that bitstamp, btce and huobi together. I don't understand how they could become insolvent even they have lost 90% of our bitcoin they are able to get the money back and even they don't the fat boy have 250 000 bitcoin and can lunch gox to the moon only with one mouse click.

for transmit an order to bitstamp it take 2 seconds. You will be able to adjust your price once every 5 seconds. If you choice a price that is 5 sec old you will not be able to sell if there is a sell run. It couldn't work like this.

Yes there isn't a market order. You can't cancel you order and adjust the price in the same loop. When you cancel a order the money take some time to become available again so it don't work in the same loop.
I have write a trade bot which stop loss work with the order book. You put the amount of money after what you want them back and it calculate the amount of money is available in the orderbook. When the amount is lower it sell btc at any price offered in the order book. This is a stop loss and not a script that "sell at loss"...
It have some other function and can find the best price for buy in a uptrend and some other stuff.
