Well it's Satoshis at that point, or milliBits. Just like the US has dollars, and sometimes you're putting in fractions into a vending machine to buy a can of soda.

Definitely do.

Haha thanks, and thanks for staying skeptical.
All this does is take a string of your public-key address (no private keys, period) and makes a QR code representation and a clickable plaintext link that copies that address to the clipboard. It's basically one view that encapsulates that with customization of colors, fonts, and text to make it consistent with any app's design.
You can read the code and check it out, the only 3 files that matter are BTCDonationViewController.{h,m,xib} as everything else is stock iOS project fare.

Noooooo, I was at Stix in Birmingham, AL last week! You have to get more publicity out for this - I totally would have paid in btc.

I feel like he's squinting at the rising Sun that is bitcoin. o7
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:51:39
Then they can changetip it or bitcoin tip it. Why make more addresses when most people already have usernames on a handful of services?

Also remember that it's a release candidate, and not a full public release. It's basically a beta version. Just wait - your wallets will probably be prepared to update when the public version goes out.

Dude, you have got to be a little more optimistic. Your comments in this thread are coming off as pure defeatist, and unimaginative. You should try some interesting and creative marketing to get bitcoin customers.
@_date: 2014-03-30 12:51:54
Haha, I see what you're saying, but I think there are enough use cases where someone could hold the QR code up or have it displayed and another person could scan it.

No, I don't believe so, as this is just a donation tool. There are several apps on the marketplace that list their BTC address for donation purposes. Apple uses the "purchasing" guideline to stop apps from using BTC to purchase in-app goods, or app-related features. This also tangentially prevents transfers from happening in the app (aka you spending your own bitcoin through an app).

Over by a long shot. It's not illegal. I've dealt with Coinbase for a while and I'm in Alabama - not the most liberal of states. Alabama Credit Union has never contacted me about "suspicious transactions."

People also won't send bitcoin until the prices are low enough as well. We're talking about market equilibrium here. It'll find it's local minimum.
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:25:04
It's bitcoin. The guard has changed; if the blockchain is public, so should your bitcoin reserves.
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:15:53
Alabama Credit Union has never called to question a Coinbase transfer from me as well. I did 7 small denomination transfers within about 3 hours when Mt. Gox went down about a week and a half ago, and nothing. The transfers all went through no problem.

I think you need a verifiable SSL cert before I step foot on your site.
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:28:12
Yeah but they'll change; enough people will want the lower fees and the wallets will have to keep up.
@_date: 2014-03-13 02:35:34
That's 90%, not 10%. Your example should be:
Can you imagine living in a world where you can go from having enough money to pay for 10 candy bars to only 9 in a matter of minutes?
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:17:04
10,000 combinations? That'll be cracked in seconds with a botnet... Who's willing to give up their wallet there for science (aka to see how good their insurance policy really is)?
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:50:54
An order of magnitude lower transaction fee is **good** news.
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:32:27
Been doing that weekly since 2014. Spent ~1000, worth around 13000. Still holding ��
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:28:15
Exactly, I'm super long on bitcoin. Buy a little bit every week and save most for the long haul and use some here and there.
@_date: 2016-05-04 21:30:29
What's the evidence if you don't mind me asking?
@_date: 2016-05-03 14:02:44
Exactly my sentiment. Lol what? All you have to do is sign using the key, and the rest will speak for itself.

There'd be a ton of amateur mistakes, if that were the case. And I know you're going to say "well he could have taken the time to iron them out." And my response is: not without prior programming knowledge and experience to know that working things are not great working things. There's difference between little hacks that work, but open you up to major scalability, reusability, or edge cases novice programmers don't/can't think about yet. That's what experience is for. An inexperienced programmer will make those mistakes and not even know to fix them. That's why bitcoin wasn't done by an inexperienced programmer. Especially when it comes to c++.
