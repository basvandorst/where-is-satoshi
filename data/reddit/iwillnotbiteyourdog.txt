Sept. 20 (Straits Times) -- THE Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) is cautioning consumers against bitcoin trading
even as a few merchants in Singapore have started accepting the
digital currency as payment for physical goods.
Invented in 2009, bitcoin is the world's most well-known
digital currency. It is not issued or managed by a single company
or monetary authority.
Bitcoins can be bought through online exchanges that convert
real money into the virtual currency. Due to its anonymous
nature, bitcoin trading was declared illegal in Thailand in July
over money laundering concerns.
On Singapore's sole bitcoin exchange FYB-SG, more than
$440,000 worth of bitcoins have been transacted since it started
operating in January this year. One bitcoin was sold for about
$167.83 yesterday.
An MAS spokesman told The Straits Times that consumers
should be wary of such trading.
"If bitcoin ceases to operate, there may not be an
identifiable party responsible for refunding their monies or for
them to seek recourse," the spokesman said.
Like other virtual currencies, such as game credits and
airline miles, MAS does not regulate bitcoin trading.
MAS' warning comes even as a handful of merchants here, such
as cafes, have started to accept bitcoins for goods like beer and
Merchants said they profit from not paying any transaction
fee and from a potential rise in the exchange rate.
Mr Chad Samson, 30, owner of Cad Cafe at Haji Lane, said:
"It does not make sense for a small business like mine to pay the
high credit card transaction fees."
But Mr Prashant Somosundram, 33, owner of cafe Artistry at
Jalan Pinang, acknowledged the element of risk. "As my
transaction volumes are still small, I'm willing to write off my
investments," he said.
Artistry had about 30 bitcoin transactions worth a total of
$300 since mid-July, when it started taking in bitcoins. Its
value has risen by about one-third, which works out to a profit
of $100.
HOW TO PAY WITH BITCOIN
Merchants need to enter the sale amount in Singapore dollars
via a point-of-sale (POS) program such as Bitcoin POS.
The software then generates a QR code based on the
prevailing bitcoin exchange rate.
To make a purchase, customers scan the QR code using bitcoin
e-wallet apps like BitcoinSpinner and Bitcoin Wallet, both of
which are available only on Android phones. The sale amount in
bitcoin will then be transferred to the merchants.

Regulator Examines Bitcoin Practices
New York Issues Subpoenas to Firms Tied to Bitcoin
By ROBIN SIDEL
New York's top banking regulator has issued subpoenas to roughly two dozen companies associated with bitcoin as part of a wide-ranging inquiry into the business practices of the fledgling virtual-currency industry, according to people familiar with the matter.
The subpoenas, from the New York Department of Financial Services, seek information on a range of topics, including antimoney-laundering programs, consumer-protection measures and investment strategies, according to the people..
The department, led by Benjamin Lawsky, also plans on Monday to issue a memo expressing concern that virtual-currency companies aren't complying with the state's money-transmission laws. As a result, the state is considering setting new guidelines that are specifically aimed at virtual currencies.
"We believe that—for a number of reasons—putting in place appropriate regulatory safeguards for virtual currencies will be beneficial to the long-term strength of the virtual-currency industry," wrote Mr. Lawsky in a draft of the memo reviewed by The Wall Street Journal.
Companies that received subpoenas include some of the best-known names in the nascent industry, including Coinbase Inc., BitInstant and Coinsetter.
Executives from Coinbase and BitInstant couldn't be reached for comment on Sunday. Jaron Lukasiewicz, chief executive of Coinsetter, said in an email that the information request is "an opportunity for companies in our space to open up a much needed dialogue with regulators."
He added, "They'll quickly find that most companies are working to legitimize Bitcoin and want to build bridges that help regulators understand and support these financial innovations."
The state agency also sent subpoenas to companies backed by high-profile Bitcoin investors, including venture capitalist Marc Andreessen, and twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are best known for battling Mark Zuckerberg over ownership of Facebook Inc. FB -0.10% Mr. Andreessen and the Winklevoss brothers couldn't be reached for comment on Sunday.
Bitcoin, the best-known of a crop of virtual currencies, are created in a computer process called "mining." They also can be traded on a number of exchanges or swapped privately among users. Most bitcoin are traded on a Tokyo-based exchange called Mt. Gox, where one bitcoin was valued Friday at roughly $102.
A subpoena is a legal demand for information and doesn't signal wrongdoing by the recipient. The New York banking department sent the subpoenas late last week, according to the people familiar with the matter.
The subpoenas come amid heightened scrutiny from state and federal regulators into the world of virtual currencies. Because virtual currencies aren't backed by a central government like traditional ones are, regulators are worried they can be used for illegal activity or can violate laws involving money transmission.
Federal regulators earlier this year issued guidelines placing virtual-currency exchanges under the same comprehensive antimoney-laundering requirements as traditional money-transmission businesses such as Western Union Co.
Although a growing number of bitcoin exchanges have registered their businesses with the U.S. Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, they have moved more slowly at the state level. In part, that is because the process of getting a license in each of the 48 states that require them is complicated and lengthy. In addition, states also typically require companies to put up a bond that could run as much as several million dollars.
New York has been one of a handful of states aggressively examining the industry. Mr. Lawsky has assembled a team to assess the issue and already sent a warning letter to BitInstant, a New York company that allows customers to buy and sell bitcoins.
"If virtual currencies remain a virtual Wild West for narcotraffickers and other criminals, that would not only threaten our country's national security, but also the very existence of the virtual currency industry as a legitimate business enterprise," according to the memo.
The round of subpoenas also are aimed at gleaning information about how the companies are dealing with individual investors who may be attracted to the novelty of virtual currencies, but may not be sophisticated enough to understand the risk associated with them.

The Bitcoin believers
By Stephen Foley and Jane Wild
A growing band of young evangelists believe the virtual currency Bitcoin is the economic future. But how long before regulation catches up with them?
“My goal is to get rich,” says Jonathan Mohan, blunt as you like. Given that the 23-year-old Queens native is studying entrepreneurship at New York’s Baruch College, the statement is hardly surprising. What marks Mohan out is that when he daydreams of wealth, it is not dollar signs that flash up before his eyes, it is Bitcoin.
More and more people are dreaming that Bitcoin, a virtual currency so far most famous for its wild price swings, will one day become a ubiquitous form of payment. They hope that the value of the finite stock of digital coins will soar, and that a host of entrepreneurial opportunities will present themselves in a new “Bitcoin economy”.
Intellectually self-confident and eager to plunge into debate, Mohan is quickly becoming a catalyser of the New York Bitcoin community. He is organiser of a regular “meet-up” group which aims to connect the Bitcoin-curious, and which has helped build interest even after an apparently life-threatening price crash in April. Mohan wants to get rich, and he wants to wreck government as we know it, too. Through Bitcoin, a currency outside the purview of banks and government control, Mohan sees “a chance to build a financial business with no regulation. Government is coercion and force. You don’t fight coercion with coercion, you just ignore it. Bitcoin allows you to ignore it.”
One of the stickers on his laptop is for the Seasteading Institute, a project backed by the billionaire PayPal founder Peter Thiel, which aims to build a floating city in international waters where “the next generation of pioneers can peacefully test new ideas for government”. And Mohan is taken with the notion, voiced by the extraordinarily persistent Republican presidential candidate Ron Paul, that even war can be eradicated, if only governments were denied the ability to finance deficits through printing money. “Would you rather buy a diamond or a blood diamond?” he asks rhetorically. “Obviously a diamond. So, would you rather use a Bitcoin or a dollar? When I gave someone $5 in Bitcoin, I didn’t kill any children in Iraq.”
The strongest evangelisers of Bitcoins have always been libertarians. This is broadly the political hue of the Bitcoin Foundation, set up by some of the earliest users and entrepreneurs of the currency to steward its development. But an increasing majority of the people interested in Bitcoin are only “libertarianish”, despairing of government rather than opposed to it. And they are hardly just in the US.
Around the world, a generation is growing up whose intellectual framework was forged in an economic conflagration which destroyed the reputations of government, finance and central banks alike. The only heroes in this landscape are the hoodie-wearing tech entrepreneurs with their billion-dollar businesses.
At Mohan’s meet-up, it is not politics that is at the fore, but entrepreneurship. There are more than 30 people in the room. Five are women. Probably no more than three are over 35. Many are software developers, sniffing around for an interesting project and preferably a lucrative one.
The formal part of the evening is a lecture on the “basics of Bitcoin”, yet the discussion often turns to stunts that might build Bitcoin’s profile. Someone suggests stamping secret codes on real dollar bills which lucky finders can then exchange for virtual currency, creating a kind of countrywide treasure hunt. Mohan is trying to persuade a friend of a friend to let them on to the floor of the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, to make a symbolic Bitcoin transaction in the home of derivatives trading. A driving aim is that next week’s meet-up should be bigger than this week’s and that the one after be bigger than that.
To be a Bitcoin user is to be a Bitcoin evangelist. This must be the case: no central bank certifies a “promise to pay the bearer on demand” the sum of anything in particular; no Treasury has declared it “legal tender for all debts, public and private”. The Bitcoin in your pocket (or more accurately, your digital wallet) is worth only as much as other people’s desire to use it or at least to possess it.
These have been a giddy few months within the Bitcoin community. For reasons that remain a mystery, the price of the currency began rising sharply in March, and when some people claimed this might have something to do with the bailout raid on Cypriot bank deposits and a crisis of confidence in traditional banking, media interest helped to accelerate the ascent. The price for a single Bitcoin, less than $14 at the start of the year, spiked to $266 before crashing. It now hovers at about $110. The volatility may have set back the currency’s utility as a reliable means of exchange but, as with a previous price spike in 2011, it only appears to have piqued more interest.
Bitcoin was created four years ago by an unknown computer scientist with the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who conceived it as an alternative to government-controlled currencies and a means to transfer money quickly, cheaply and anonymously outside the slow, expensive and highly regulated international banking system. Transactions are recorded in the “blockchain”, a massive block of code stored across a peer-to-peer network of computers. These computers are called miners because their owners are rewarded for their service with occasional payment in new Bitcoins. The total number of coins will never be allowed to exceed 21 million.
So far, Bitcoin is accepted at only a smattering of ecommerce sites – most notoriously, the mail-order drugs site Silk Road – and an even smaller handful of real-world shops, all run by evangelists. An average $30m of Bitcoin transactions are recorded every day.
In recent weeks, high-profile venture capital outfits, such as Thiel’s Founders Fund and Fred Wilson’s Union Square Ventures, have plunked down just-in-case bets on new Bitcoin payments businesses, reinforcing the headlines. Angel investors and business incubators are nurturing new Bitcoin ideas around the world. The financial establishment doesn’t know if the currency is friend or foe: money transfer businesses Western Union and MoneyGram are said to be looking at the feasibility of accepting Bitcoin, but there are suspicions that banks are using concerns about money laundering as an excuse to shut down the accounts of businesses that could become rivals.
Evangelists will almost always preface their remarks by saying that Bitcoin is still an experiment, but they share the same under-the-skin itch: a sense that this thing could make them a lot of money.
. . .
Josh Rossi is built to evangelise. The 31-year-old hops around like a sack of rabbits as he explains his attraction to Bitcoin. “It’s a hot tech start-up, mixed with emerging markets, mixed with gold, mixed with forex [foreign exchange]. It’s a gold rush. It’s a land-grab. It’s the Wild West. There’s going to be a Goldman Sachs in this economy. If you build a better mousetrap, you could be a millionaire.”

sorry I cann't agree that [derivatives] increase the incentive to manipulate the underlying asset.
suppose BTC is $100 now. Suppose some greedy/dishonest person wants to buy some BTC a little cheaper than where they're trading. There are lots of ways to manipulate the market even if physical delivery is required and MtGox doesn't crash, e.g. he can trade with himself, publishing a series of tiny transactions a little below market. Then he buys the notional he wants to buy below the fair market price of 100 from someone misled by his "fake" trades.
if he wants to convert some BTC to USD above marker, he can likewise buy some small amounts from himself a litle above market, and hope to mislead whoever buys the notional he wants to sell.
The availability of non-delivery derivatives doesn't add the incentive to manipulate the market in this and many other ways, and doesn't make it any easier.

INTERVIEW: Malta-Based Fund Taps Into Distrust Of State Money With Bitcoin
Tom Burroughes
Group Editor in London
Editor's note: This is one of a series of articles touching on wealth management firms in the jurisdiction of Malta. To view a recent interview with international law firm and fund services firm Maitland, click here. 
As pretty much anyone in the wealth management industry knows - or should know - the basic requirement of any client is to preserve wealth. With the “financial repression” of negative interest rates, people have turned to gold, real estate, certain equities and esoteric fields such as fine art to do the job.
All these asset classes have drawbacks, however. Even gold, to take Man’s oldest safe haven asset, is not bullet-proof, as shown when President Franklin D Roosevelt confiscated private gold holdings in the 1930s. With that sort of drastic event in mind, today’s digital economy has come up with “Bitcoin”, a form of electronic, or virtual, money that is, its supporters claim, designed to replicate the scarcity of metal currencies without the tricky physical storage and handling issues. It has made headlines with a number of giddy price gyrations; it has also prompted worries from some commentators and regulators as to whether it could be misused by criminals. Bank of Singapore’s chief economist, Richard Jerram, for example, recently doubted whether Bitcoin will challenge global monetary systems. In May, US police froze the accounts of Mt Gox, the world's largest Bitcoin exchange, after claiming it was operating as an "unlicensed money service business." Bitcoin is controversial.
Last autumn, a Malta-headquartered "next generation brokerage company", Exante, launched the Malta-registered Bitcoin Fund enabling high net worth investors, among others, to hold units in Bitcoins. It is the first fund of its kind in the world. Gatis Eglitis, managing partner of Exante (Malta), told this publication about the fund when WealthBriefing visited his firm’s offices in St Julian’s on the Mediterranean island recently. (The firm has recently held its inaugural awards ceremony in Lisbon, Portugal.)
The decision to launch the fund was made because “we wanted to include Bitcoin in our multi-asset trading platform, but because it was not considered to be a real asset like stocks or futures. Being a regulated entity we had to think about the institutionalisation of it. Thus we came up with an idea to wrap Bitcoin within a hedge fund form and offer them to our customers electronically on Exante's multi-asset platform with one click,” he said.  
Eglitis said the fund was considered as investment in technology and the technology has proven to be robust enough, having been around for three years. “We set up Exante to service our brokerage clients that would like to invest in FX, metals, futures, stocks, forwards, options, bonds, hedge funds and other financial products - all from one electronic online trading platform - from one account. Bitcoin fund was set up more like a project to expand our product offering,” he said.
Clearly, with concerns about central bank quantitative easing – in other words, money printing – the timing of the launch of such a fund is interesting. Despite recent pullbacks, the decade-long ascent of gold, for example, is ample proof of how concerned many investors have been about the eroding value of mainstream fiat currencies. (Since the gold link to the dollar was severed by Richard Nixon in 1971, the US currency has lost more than 80 per cent of its purchasing power.)
“For the last decade wealth preservation when working with HNW individuals has been a really hot topic. This is the reality,” Eglitis continued.

For Bitcoin VCs, There’s No Sexier Word Than “Compliance”
There are few things that people agree on about bitcoin, the virtual currency that has increasingly come under the media spotlight this year. But here’s one: If the controversial payment method is going to receive mainstream adoption, it’s going to have to get easier to both buy and sell.
As a result, when you look around at U.S. startups trying to enter the space, a large chunk are bitcoin infrastructure businesses, either trying to build an exchange to rival Mt. Gox, a digital wallet, or tools to trade or transfer the currency. So it’s only fitting that at an investor pitch event last week in New York City for bitcoin startups, all nine of the pitches centered on at least one of these elements.
For the winning startup, a yet-to-launch bitcoin exchange called CoinX, the differentiator was not a superior product (we didn’t even see it in action); it was simply a thought-out plan on how to comply with state policies that regulate money transmitter businesses.
“There are few things scarier than the threat of the government turning off your [portfolio] business and that possibility 100 percent exists with bitcoin,” said Matthew Witheiler, principal at Flybridge Capital Partners, and one of the four investor panelists at the pitch event. “The bitcoin companies that win will be the ones that play by the rules.”
Andrew Chang, a partner at Liberty City Ventures, a VC firm that has created a dedicated bitcoin startup fund, said he is looking for startups that approach their business “not necessarily as tech startups would approach it, but as financial institutions would.”
“That means complying with all the regulations that exist in the different countries you operate, and getting the necessary licensing,” he said. “Rather than approaching it from the standpoint of, ‘Let me just launch, open up a bank account here, without addressing the appropriate regulatory issues.’”
In March, the Treasury Department’s Financial Crimes Enforcement Network issued some guidance on virtual-currency businesses, but there are still many gray areas when it comes to bitcoin and compliance.
Still, the better you articulate your plan for making sure the government is cool with your bitcoin business, the better your chances are for raising capital. CoinX founder Megan Burton did not demo the exchange during last week’s pitch, but she did present a plan for complying with anti-money-laundering policies that money-service businesses have to abide by. Namely, she said her startup had hired a law firm to apply for a money-transmitter license in all the states that mandate it — a task that requires equal parts patience and capital.
Burton also said she had signed deals with three banks who would do business with CoinX — such a rare occurrence for bitcoin-related money-service businesses in the U.S., according to several VCs, that the panel of investors almost didn’t believe the news. They were so surprised, in fact, that Witheiler asked again if Burton actually had finalized agreements.
“We actually went through 46 banks to find three that said yes,” Burton told him.
Burton wouldn’t divulge who those banks were, But that’s almost besides the point, Witheiler said.
“Getting any bank is a huge plus and validation,” he said.

The interesting part:
New products, including access facilities to new markets, are de­signed according to Exante’s own customer demand trends. Mr Eglitis says the business will grow as it continues to seek new markets and innovate. Its representatives recently re­turned from successful business trips in Libya, Colombia and South Africa.
Last October, Exante launched its Bitcoin Fund to take advantage of using the virtual currency and to satisfy investor and manager demand for an investment vehicle for bitcoin placements.
In just six months, bitcoin value has rocketed from $6 (€4.6) to just under $150 (€115) and usage and acceptance online is gaining ground, despite some attacks on online services and exchanges dealing in bitcoin.
Mr Eglitis says Exante is undeterred. Current assets under management in the Bitcoin Fund are $3.2 million (€2.5m) with others of considerable value lined up.
“Bitcoin is growing really fast,” he said. “There are several reasons why it should survive. It is not currency – it is technology. It lives in the internet, so to speak, and you cannot ban what lives in the internet. And there is limited supply. Besides, bitcoins allow for complete transparency: every transaction is traceable.”

Yes, someone other than the exchange could do try feeding their data to Bloomberg et al, even for free as a labor of love. It doesn't sound very difficult. More transparency sounds good... But my original question was (and I'm really asking out of sheer curiosity) - why don't the exchanges do this themselves? Would they even object if someone else did?
(In contrast, Alba Sucre's creators ( - site in Spanish) have been promoting it in particular by feeding its spot rate to market data vendors, so Bloomberg et al consider XSU (which isn't in ISO 4217) a currency (eg  ). Although  shows no data right now )

“We are very vulnerable in the world today,” he said, talking about the still-fragile nature of many banks’ balance sheets, high debts, and the worries about mainstream monetary systems. “The slightest problems happen and our security is gone,” Eglitis said. 
What is Bitcoin?
Bitcoin is seen as an inelastic type of money as its quantity cannot be indefinitely increased. According to one description at Wikipedia, Bitcoin “is a digital currency first described in a 2008 paper by pseudonymous developer Satoshi Nakamoto, who called it a peer-to-peer, electronic cash system.”
The creation and exchange of Bitcoin is based on an open-source cryptographic protocol and is not managed by any central authority - the latter fact being something that might frighten politicians (possibly not a bad thing). Each Bitcoin is subdivided down to eight decimal places, forming 100 million smaller units called satoshis. Bitcoin can be transferred through a computer or smartphone without an intermediate financial institution such as a bank. Again, such features, while now part of our electronic lives, have prompted calls by regulators such as in the US to impose oversight.
Using an analogy with the language of the gold market, Bitcoin processing is secured by servers called “Bitcoin miners”. These servers communicate over an internet-based network and confirm transactions by adding them to a ledger which is updated and archived periodically. Each new ledger update creates some newly-minted Bitcoin; a crucial feature is that the number of new Bitcoin units or “Bitcoins” created in each update is halved every four years until the year 2140 when this number will decline to zero. After that time no more Bitcoins will be created - the total number of Bitcoins will have reached a maximum of 21 million Bitcoins. That, at least, is the theory.
Eglitis and colleagues list out other benefits of Bitcoin: it does not need to be protected in big, costly-to-guard vaults; it can be transferred around the world in seconds (unlike physical gold); it does not need verifications to show authenticity, whereas gold has to be tested physically; Bitcoin has eight digits on the right side of the comma, so it can service small payments, whereas one would need gold dust to do so, which is often impractical. Finally, Exante says, all transactions of Bitcoin can be audited online in real time so that all system members know exactly how many coins exist, whereas gold requires participants to use third-party auditors.
The fund
The fund works in the following way: The hedge fund is like an exchange traded fund where one fund unit is equivalent to one Bitcoin - there is no speculation in the fund – and its purpose is to maintain the equilibrium of one unit per one Bitcoin. The fund is exclusively traded on Exante’s multi-asset platform and cannot be bought anywhere else. The reason for the fund is to give institutions and private individuals access to Bitcoin in a financial instrument form.
Interestingly, the fund levies no annual management or performance haircut – unlike most hedge funds. Instead, there is a 0.5 per cent entry and exit fee, and a "safekeeping" fee of 1.75 per cent per year.
So far, there have been no redemptions of Bitcoin assets from the fund, Eglitis said. The fund is a long-only vehicle – there is no shorting involved.
Exante and Malta
The firm is an example of how Malta, once a UK colony and military base and now an independent, European Union member state, is playing host to alternative investment fund vehicles, wealth managers and other financial services firms. Exante was created in 2012. Its main software development office, meanwhile, is in Moscow, and it has offices in Singapore and St Petersburg, Russia. It aims to soon open an office in London.
There is more to Exante than Bitcoin. The main focus of the business is prime brokerage with a strong emphasis on technology. The partners at the firm have a blend of financial, science and technology experience. Eglitis, for example, has worked as an institutional sales trader and later as an institutional business sales manager in Saxo Bank, among other firms. Anatoliy Knyazev is the managing partner of Exante (Malta), qualifying as a mathematician and systems programmer. Among his roles was that of director in Global Hedge Capital Group, participating in projects for the design of systems and applications for tick market data visualisation and its analysis. Another partner is Alexey Kirienko.
So how does Eglitis predict the Bitcoin market will develop?
He expects it to get larger; Eglitis also expects that some regulators and other government bodies will try and increase oversight and control, albeit with limited success.
At the heart of the issue, he said, is that Bitcoin challenges many of the assumptions - which he likens to “religions” - that many economists and policymakers have about how the economic world works.
“We have a lot of religions in the world and we have a lot of different economic belief systems out there – Keynesianism, Monetarism, and others. We are hard scientists…we see causes and consequences and work on analysing the facts as they are,” he said.
“We see that current global liquidity management is not working as it has been designed to do. What monetary tools do central banks have when inflation is created by themselves while economies are stagnating?” he said.  
He said the “Austrian” school of economics - with its liberal approach to interest rates and tradition of supporting a monetary system backed by some scarce product - is probably the closest to Exante’s thinking and the case for Bitcoin, he said. (For more on the “Austrian" approach to money and banking, click here.)
Eglitis also answers those who might fear that Bitcoin could be misused by criminals, such as money launderers, or just not gain critical mass. “I am not saying that criminals are not using it, but I would argue that it is probably not the best way of making transactions for criminals, because it would disclose many tracks for investigators when or if wallet identification linked with its owner. Bitcoin holders do enjoy anonymity, until their wallet is linked with them,” he said.
Recent market shifts – there have been some dramatic price gyrations – have so far not deterred Exante’s clients from holding Bitcoins, Eglitis added. In fact, some early turbulence is probably a good test of how robust this nascent currency will be.
For as Eglitis and his business partners would suggest, people scoffed in the early days of the internet when some suggested it would revolutionise business, social and cultural life. They are not scoffing any longer. With all predictions, a good deal of caution is in order, but for the moment at least, Bitcoin is not going away.

No, an analyst earns money by generating trade ideas for clients. Clients who trade via his firm (rather than via a cheaper platform) are rewarded with access to his research (which is generally not available to the public). The goal of trade ideas is to get the clients to trade more, not necessarily to make money for the clients.
The tools that currency analysis use (looking at the likes of the issuing country's trade deficit, or central bank's stated policy) don't apply to BTC (or XAU).
I doubt that a client asked Sebastien about BTC, except perhaps to make fun of him.

It would be easier for speculators to speculate on the future value of BTC (or any other underlying asset whose value is easily observable) by trading non-delivery forward contracts.
Here's how they work: suppose skeptic A wants to bet that BTC would be worth more than some strike S (say $100) at some future date (say 1 month). Bitcoin fan B wants to take the opposite site of this bet with notional N. At the end of the contract, A pays B the dollar amount of N * (X - S), where X is the observed market rate.
A and B would need to agree where they observe X with no need for physical delivery. No need for any options.
(Alternatively they could make a similar bet with physical delivery of BTC.)

Paywalled WSJ article: 
Winklevoss Twins Plan a Bitcoin Venture
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss Filed Paperwork for an IPO Tied to the Value of Bitcoin Digital Currency
By DAVID BENOIT And ANDREW R. JOHNSON
Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, twins known for battling Mark Zuckerberg over ownership of Facebook Inc., FB -0.28% have filed for an initial public offering designed to allow investors to track the performance of the digital currency bitcoin.
The Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust said Monday in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission that it will sell about $20 million worth of shares, each of which will represent a fraction of a bitcoin.
The Winklevoss trust believes "that, for many investors, the Shares will represent a cost-effective and convenient means to access exposure to bitcoins," the filing says. It adds that, at the $20 million offering value, each share would represent 0.2 bitcoin.
Bitcoin is the name for both the digital currency and the peer-to-peer payments system that allows people to pay one another using the currency from virtual accounts accessed online and on mobile devices. Launched in 2009 by a developer whose identity remains unknown, the digital money isn't backed by a central governing body, such as the Federal Reserve, and allows users to remain mostly anonymous save for their "bitcoin address" in transactions.
The filing lays out the case for the trust as a way for an average investor to make a wager on bitcoin.
The aim will be to have an investment that reflects a "weighted average" of bitcoin prices, the filing says. The product would operate like exchange-traded funds, listing on a stock exchange, though a particular exchange wasn't identified. The filing says it would be the first such offering of a bitcoin exchange-traded product.
Buzz around bitcoin has grown in recent months amid wild swings in the currency's value, driven by a range of factors: economic turmoil in the euro zone; outages at Mt. Gox, the largest bitcoin trading exchange; and U.S. Treasury Department guidance stating money-transmitter rules that apply to the likes of Western Union Co. WU +0.06% and MoneyGram International Inc. MGI +2.34% also apply to exchanges and sellers dealing in the currency.
Mt. Gox, based in Tokyo, last week registered with the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, the arm of the Treasury Department that enforces the money-transmitter rules. The move followed the Department of Homeland Security seizing an account tied to Mt. Gox, alleging the company operated an unlicensed money-services business. The Tokyo company has said it was making system improvements.
State regulators have also been focusing on companies that sell and exchange bitcoin. The Wall Street Journal reported last month that California, New York and Virginia have been contacting various bitcoin companies asking them to clarify what their businesses do, a move that could ultimately prompt the states to clamp down on their activities or force them to register under their own rules that apply to money transmitters.
The Winklevoss twins became famous for their feud with Mr. Zuckerberg, Facebook founder and chief executive, regarding who came up with the idea for the social network. The litigation ultimately settled. The twins, also Olympic rowers, were key characters in the movie "The Social Network."
The filing lists several risks tied to the bitcoin world, including a warning that the currency's price may remain volatile given its "relative lack of acceptance" in the retail and commercial marketplace. The paperwork didn't list a bank as an underwriter.
A representative for the trust declined to comment beyond the filing.

It's almost the same thing, but trade ideas aren't phrased like "use any instrument to take the view that EUR will be par with USD a year from now". They're phrased like, "sell USD and buy EUR today, sell EUR and buy PLN tomorrow, sell PLN and buy USD the next day". The are intended to generate order flow. They eschew anything more sophisticated, like options.      asking such people about BTC is like asking them about hedging one's vega. Not something he knows...

So I went to my Bloomberg and tred accessing "XBT Currency" and got this error message:
XBT Curncy
"Access to this security is restricted by its supplier"
Edit: I made this meme 
You may recall the same discussion a few months ago, when I (and other paying Bloomberg users) were asking Bloomberg to show BTC spot, and Bloomberg was very happy to do that, but Mt Gox were being assholes in at least 3 ways:
* Bloomberg asked for a feed; Mt Gox told them to access a URL like everyone else
* Mt Gox claimed that Bloomberg wanted to be paid for displaying the data; Bloomberg denied this
* Bloomberg indicated that Mt Gox wanted to be paid for supplying the data.
We'll see soon how all this works out.

Tech Entrepreneurs Invest in Trading Platform for Bitcoin
By KATY BURNE
A group of big-name technology entrepreneurs are throwing their weight behind a new platform dedicated to trading in "bitcoin," an emerging alternative to paper money.
Bitcoin, which began its life in 2009, is now a fast-growing virtual currency. The mostly paperless trades take place on approved Internet websites and mobile-phone applications, allowing users to make purchases and invest in the currency the way they would do dollars and euros.
A new platform called Coinsetter is launching late in the second quarter that will be first to allow participants to trade bitcoin using borrowed money, knowing as trading on "margin," or to make bets against its value.
Coinsetter last week raised $500,000 from a host of enterprenuers, said its founder Jaron Lukasiewicz, who most recently was an associate at Houston private equity firm The CapStreet Group and previously worked at J.P. Morgan Chase &amp; Co.
Among the backers are Barry Silbert, founder of illiquid securities trading platform SecondMarket; New-York based Tribeca Venture Partners; Charles Songhurst, head of corporate strategy at Microsoft MSFT +2.10% ; and Ben Davenport, founder of group messaging service Beluga, which was acquired by Facebook FB -0.56% in 2011.
Several investors didn't immediately return messages, but Brian Hirsch of Tribeca confirmed the investment.
"While we're still in the early days of Bitcoin and real risks remain, we see the potential to disrupt a number of established multi-billion dollar markets including the world currency and payment markets," he said. SecondMarket confirmed Mr. Silbert made this investment through the firm's Bitcoin Opportunity Fund.
The value of one unit of bitcoin surpassed $100 earlier this month, up from around $13 in January, said Mr. Lukasiewicz. It now sits around $200, according to Mt. Gox, the largest exchange for bitcoin.
Unlike dollar bills, bitcoin isn't backed by the full faith and credit of any government. Proponents say its supply is limited, so its value rises and falls on demand like any currency. Transactions are mostly anonymous. A person can wire funds from a bank account to an exchange, where he or she can buy bitcoin. Bitcoin can be held in a virtual 'wallet' online before making purchases.
While the software behind the currency is "open source," meaning it is accessible to anyone online, proponents believe it is too difficult for hackers to penetrate and create copies.

The government converted USD-denominated bank accounts to pesos using the old peg rate 1 ARS = 1 USD, and froze them. The government broke the peg. Local currency fell to ~4 ARS = 1 USD in a few weeks.
Governments can't do this with Bitcoin. Government can do pretty much whatever they want with fiat currencies.

The previous Argentine regime (which was more Bush-like) tried exactly that. They pegged local currency to USD. 
but that did not work out well: everyone was betting that the peg would break soon. Local currency interest rate was well into double digits in 2001. The government was spending all its funds on subsidizing the peg. Eventually they ran out of money, defaulted on their debts (in a very messy way at the end of 2001), and the local currency depreciated ~70% v USD within a month.
Ecuador was more successful when they abolished local currency and made USD their currency. The same thing probably would have been better both for Argentina and Brazil in 2001.

Bitcoin was just the start for virtual currencies. Cloud-computing certificates, anyone?
By BOB GELFOND
The digital currency called Bitcoin may or may not survive long-term, but it has already succeeded on one front: making people think seriously about alternative forms of money. More such alternatives to traditional currency will likely emerge.
The attraction of the Bitcoin is not just the anonymity it provides to users (an anonymity that the U.S. government has alleged some users have employed for money laundering). Bitcoin is also secure against traditional forms of counterfeiting. More important, the Bitcoin is designed to be scarce and thus immune to inflation. There is a limit to the number of Bitcoins—21 million—that is determined by a transparent rule and not by the whim of a central banker.
Gold used to serve this purpose. It was a commodity that was relatively scarce and not easily mined, thus reducing the risk of inflation. That valuable function has been superseded by today's paper moneys. In this sense, Bitcoin is an electronic version of gold.
In the future, it is likely that other digital alternatives to currency will emerge, each one competing in the market to satisfy the needs of users. The possibilities are limited only by the imagination. Here is one:
Cloud-computing companies could issue certificates convertible into an hour of premium computing. Prices for other services could be quoted in terms of these certificates. The analogy is to traditional gold-backed currency, which was redeemable into physical gold at the option of the owner. While the dollar price of an hour of premium computing would vary with market conditions, the certificate would be guaranteed to always convert into one hour of premium computing. The maxim "time is money" would take on a new meaning.
Computing has become a fundamental element of virtually every technology, a common currency, so to speak, of doing business in today's economy. Cloud-computing companies provide on-demand storage and computing at a price that varies with market conditions and the computing speed required. They compete on price and the quality and reliability of their cloud, which can be accessed from anywhere in the world at any time. Competition forces the companies to continually upgrade to the latest generation of computers and data-storage facilities.
Cloud-computing certificates could be redeemed at any time. The owner of a one-hour certificate, for example, could convert the certificate today or wait 18 months when presumably an hour of computing time would be able to do twice as much because of the increased computing speed that comes from Moore's Law.
The certificates would never expire, so the owner need never convert them. Unlike gift certificates, they would not be fixed in price to a certain dollar value but to a fixed amount of computing time. If the public gained confidence that the cloud-computing companies were not flooding the market with certificates, the certificates might be viewed as stable and liquid enough to circulate as money. If the certificates were freely transferrable, they could come to be used to buy any product or service, or be saved as a stable store of value.
As confidence and familiarity in the certificates grew, the certificates could even be used as a basis for credit or any other thing that dollars are used for. Certificates would have an advantage over Federal Reserve-produced dollars as their supply and price would be completely dictated by the market.
During slow economic times, cloud-computing companies would have less incentive to expand their clouds and would reduce the number of certificates they issued. The reverse would happen in better economic times. The certificates would have an advantage over the Bitcoin: They could be converted into something of value, instead of just being based on relative scarcity.
It is impossible to predict what kinds of money a truly free market will create in an increasingly digitized world. But we can be confident in predicting that just as markets improve the quality of all products, they will do the same for money.
Mr. Gelfond is CEO of MQS Management, an investment adviser, and founder and chairman of MagiQ Technologies, which commercializes quantum information technologies.

Bitcoin Poses a Challenge for Law Enforcement
Rise of Virtual Currency Makes It Harder for Officials to Track Criminal Activity
The rise of Bitcoin, the little-regulated digital currency, is challenging law enforcement's ability to keep tabs on the criminal underworld.
By Danny Yadron, Devlin Barrett
The rise of Bitcoin, the little-regulated digital currency, is challenging law enforcement’s ability to keep tabs on the criminal underworld.
The virtual currency is essentially encrypted computer code that is accepted as a form of payment among users, with a fluctuating value set by a market and not by any country or central bank. For those reasons and more, it can be extremely difficult to trace—similar to paying with cash—and thus could be attractive to criminals. In a number of cases, the use of bitcoin has made it harder for police to track financial transactions or seize criminal profits, law-enforcement officials said.
“Law enforcement has to figure out a way to deal with it,” said one senior law-enforcement official, who also acknowledged Bitcoin has legitimate uses. (Currency investors and some Web-services sites have adopted it, among others.)
In April, the Drug Enforcement Administration, in the first-known federal bitcoin seizure, took 11.02 bitcoins—or nearly $2,200 at current rates—from a hospitality worker who lives in South Carolina, but they haven’t charged him with a crime. Eric Daniel Hughes, who the DEA says was also known as Casey Jones, says the bitcoins didn’t belong to him, his lawyer David Aylor said.
The Los Angeles office for the DEA, which made the seizure, hasn’t made public what it contended Mr. Hughes was doing with the bitcoins, and says only that the seizure is part of a continuing investigation. (Mr. Hughes also faces state drug-possession charges following a June raid on his apartment. He has pleaded not guilty in that case, which his attorney says is unrelated to the bitcoin seizure.)
A larger case involving an online drug market that relied on the virtual currency, unsealed this month, has put Bitcoin under even more of a microscope. Federal agents shuttered the online market known as Silk Road, which has hundreds of thousands of participants, according to the criminal complaint. Despite seizing the website’s servers, federal agents have been unable to access much of the alleged ringleader’s encrypted bitcoin fortune. At current exchange rates, Silk Road took in more than $120 million in commission while the government has announced seizing $5.2 million worth of bitcoins.
A spokeswoman for the U.S. attorney’s office in the Southern District of the New York, which is pursuing the case, declined to comment.
Joshua Dratel, defense lawyer for alleged Silk Road administrator Ross Ulbricht, said in an interview that the government will have to prove that bitcoins it seized from a Silk Road account were controlled by his client. “That is a hurdle that the government is going to have to address,” Mr. Dratel said. Mr. Ulbricht remains in custody and denies all charges.
“Bitcoins seek to be virtually untraceable, leaving the buyers and sellers of drugs seemingly hidden from law enforcement,” said DEA spokesman Lawrence Payne. “As for investigations, law enforcement is keeping up with every new method criminals are using to evade authorities.”
Bitcoins also can be bought on online exchanges, similar to a stock market. The currency traded at a six-month high on an exchange this week. Late Tuesday afternoon, one bitcoin was trading at $197.55.
It remains unclear exactly how much of the overall $2.4 billion Bitcoin market could be tied to crime, and advocates say the majority of Bitcoin transactions don’t involve illicit goods.
Backers say virtual currencies offer advantages for legitimate uses. There are no bank holidays or foreign-exchange rates. More businesses, including the dating website OKCupid, run by Rainbow Humor Inc., accept bitcoins. A unit of Baidu Inc., the Chinese search giant, said last week it will now accept bitcoins as payment for some services.
Bitcoin supporters say that following the breakup of Silk Road, consumers will stop associating the currency with illegal activity. “We can move on from that,” said Brian Armstrong, CEO of Coinbase, a Bitcoin exchange service based in San Francisco. “Silk Road got shut down. The bad guys lost.”
But Bitcoin appears to have maintained popularity in online drug deals. One Bitcoin e-commerce site selling drugs, guns and malicious software, Black Market Reloaded, has seen a surge in activity since the drug market closed. The self-described administrator of the site, who goes by the username “backopy” on the site’s forum, said in a message to The Wall Street Journal that “a certain level of anonymity is achieved by middleman, like myself.”
Law enforcement has had some successes tracking Bitcoin crime. For instance, it can be easy for law enforcement to track down inexperienced Bitcoin users, said Scott Dueweke, a senior associate at Booz Allen Hamilton who has advised U.S. agencies, including the DEA, on virtual currencies.
But, Mr. Dueweke added, “If you’re sophisticated, which criminals are…then I think it is very anonymous.”

Bitcoin Couple Travels the World Using Virtual Cash
World-Wide Odyssey Spanned Three Continents and Proved One Can Live on Bitcoin Alone
By PAUL VIGNA
Nov. 13, 2013 4:12 p.m. ET
"In bitcoin," Austin Craig repeated to the woman behind the counter at the Lean Crust Pizza parlor in the Fort Greene neighborhood of Brooklyn, N.Y. "Can we pay in bitcoin?"
"In what?" came the reply.
Mr. Craig, 30 years old, was struggling to convince Nadia Alamgir of the existence of the virtual currency that has gained traction across the world, and whose value—after months of wild swings—on Wednesday reached a record of more than $400 per bitcoin.
It was Day 88 of Mr. Craig's planned 90-day, tricontinental odyssey, taken with his wife, Beccy Bingham-Craig, 29, and a film crew documenting their travails, which started in Provo, Utah. Their mission: to live on bitcoin alone.
"It's been consistently inconvenient and occasionally frustrating," Mr. Craig said outside Lean Crust, "but never impossible." Lean Crust advertised itself as bitcoin-friendly but hadn't seen much virtual foot traffic. Ms. Alamgir eventually contacted the store's owner, who arrived and processed the transaction, allowing Mr. Craig to munch on several slices.
Lean Crust, though, is one of a tiny but growing number of stores, travel agents and online merchants starting to accept the once-obscure digital currency as a means of payment. Bitcoin doesn't exist, except in the virtual world, and can only be passed from one person to another electronically. Its origins are murky: Conventional wisdom says a man or group of people going by the name Satoshi Nakamoto created bitcoin in 2009, stoking demand by making it obtainable only through complicated algorithmic searches by powerful computers.
But in the past 12 months, the bitcoin zeitgeist has taken on a life of its own. The currency is now discussed at investing conferences. The Winklevoss twins, known for their fight with Facebook Inc. founder Mark Zuckerberg, have started a bitcoin fund. It has also gained the attention of regulators who worry it can be used to launder money.
For the Craigs, bitcoin represented a chance at adventure—and an underground movie career.
They began their trek by driving east from Provo in Ms. Bingham-Craig's 2004 Volkswagen Jetta. After arriving in New York, they flew to Stockholm, Berlin and Singapore before eventually returning to Provo. In the end, they lasted 101 days, from July 23 to Nov. 1.
The Craigs weren't part of the bitcoin underground when they began the project. Mr. Craig said he first heard of the currency in 2011 and then came up with the plan to travel solely on bitcoin.
"I'm really excited about bitcoin and its future," Mr. Craig said. "It's a reimagining of money in a way that democratizes it."
Starting July 23, the day they returned from their honeymoon, the Craigs paid for everything with bitcoin, from rent to food to gas. At that time, one bitcoin was worth about $98, based on trading at the Tokyo-based Mt. Gox exchange, a primary exchange bitcoin enthusiasts have tracked.
During the trip, they had to not only introduce a number of people to the fledging currency but to persuade them to use it. After a few weeks of prodding, their landlord, Justin James, agreed to the plan—with the sweetener of a small premium over the rent—and set up his own bitcoin account.
"In the end," Mr. James said, "it hasn't been as much of an inconvenience as I thought it would be." While he hasn't become a convert, he did say he thought the experiment sounded like fun and was "happy to be a part of it."
After scouring Provo, they found one grocery store that would accept the currency. They found one auto insurance company that would take bitcoin. The single hardest thing to get regularly, Mr. Craig said, was finding gas.
"For the first two weeks," Mr. Craig said, "we had no place to fill up."
They were saved by Jeremy Furbish, a bitcoin enthusiast they knew only as Furb, who works the night shift at a Phillips 66 station outside Salt Lake City. He heard about their story and contacted them.
"Driving an hour out there on a Friday night at 10 became part of our routine," Ms. Bingham-Craig said.
Mr. Furbish has tried in his own way to preach the gospel according to bitcoin—sometimes pricing items at the store in both dollars and bitcoin—but what the Craigs did far exceeded his modest efforts, he said. "The best that I have been able to do is to get a bunch of Boy Scouts to accept bitcoin as payment for mowing my ex-wife's lawn," he said.
Mr. Craig's employer agreed to pay him in bitcoin. The couple found one travel agent, in Germany, who accepted bitcoin, and through him arranged their hotels and flights for the world tour. They drove Ms. Bingham-Craig's car, with the film crew following in a car rented with bitcoin from Five Star Auto Direct in Orem, Utah, which also helped sponsor the film. They drove from Provo to Denver, Kansas City, Chicago, Pittsburgh and New York.
The car was stocked with food and other supplies, like four five-gallon gas tanks, which were covered under a tarp to fight the fumes.
"We didn't want to end up starving and destitute in a ditch," Mr. Craig said.
In New York, they ate pizza. In Stockholm, they went hungry the first night. In Singapore, they got henna tattoos. At every stop, Mr. Craig said, they found at least one bitcoiner willing to help.
"We didn't know how much the duration of it would wear us down," Mr. Craig said. "Totally average things became monumental challenges."
In the end, despite skepticism from friends, family and the bitcoin community itself, the Craigs managed to live on bitcoin for more than three months. "We really didn't cheat," Mr. Craig said. "Everybody thought we would."

Bitcoin Exchange Makes Apparent Move to Play by U.S. Money-Laundering Rules
Company Listed as Mt. Gox Registers With Treasury Department
By JEFFREY SPARSHOTT
WASHINGTON—The world's largest bitcoin trading exchange appears to have taken a key step to comply with U.S. anti-money-laundering rules and potentially avoid additional run-ins with authorities.
A company listed as Mt. Gox this week registered as a money services business with the Treasury Department's Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, according to FinCen's website. Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which says it handles about 80% of all trading in the virtual currency, couldn't immediately be reached for comment.
FinCen in March started applying traditional money-laundering rules to "virtual currencies" amid growing concern that new forms of digital cash are being used for illicit activities. Those rules mandate that exchanges register with FinCen, follow stricter bookkeeping requirements and report transactions of more than $10,000.
About a month after the edict, the Department of Homeland Security seized an account tied to Mt. Gox, alleging the company and a subsidiary were conducting transactions "as part of an unlicensed money service business."
According to FinCen's website, the agency received Mt. Gox's registration on Thursday. The online form listed a street in Dover, Del., as the company's address.
A spokesman for FinCen had no comment on the development. Earlier this month, FinCen's director, Jennifer Shasky Calvery, said that "those offering virtual currencies must comply with…regulatory requirements, and if they do so, they have nothing to fear from Treasury."
Mt. Gox's move may bring the company in line with Treasury's rules, but could also open the exchange to increased regulatory attention.
"It gives them the color of legitimacy," said Mercedes Kelley Tunstall, a partner with the law firm Ballard Spahr LLP, who works on banking compliance issues. "It suggests that they get it, that they need to be careful in these areas. It also means that now they have put themselves on the radar screen and they need to have policies and procedures to watch out for fraudulent activity and illegal activity."
Mt. Gox already had taken measures to beef up its identification procedures for users who deposit or withdraw traditional currencies, a central tenet of anti-money-laundering procedures. In May the company said all user accounts must be verified in order to perform any fiat currency deposits or withdrawals. Verification includes submission of a valid photo ID and proof of residence such as a utility bill or tax return, according to the website.
At the time, Mt. Gox said it had more than doubled its verification support staff.
More recently, Mt. Gox halted U.S. dollar withdrawals. The company said it needed to make systems improvements amid increased trading volume.
The recent regulatory attention paid to bitcoin-related companies has likely caused some banks to become leery of doing business with such companies, attorneys have said.
But becoming registered with FinCen or state agencies that have requirements for money transmitters may not make financial institutions more comfortable working with such firms, Ms. Tunstall said.
"I think that the virtual currency industry still needs to mature before banks will feel comfortable with them," she said.
The rising popularity of virtual currencies, while no more than a drop in the bucket of global liquidity, is being fueled by Internet merchants, as well as user concerns about privacy and jitters about traditional currencies in Europe.

Sigh. Sebastien is probably good at generating predictions and trade ideas that get his firm's name in the news, and entertain retail clients causing them to trade more. But Sebastien is unlikely to be good at making predictions that come true, because the career path for his colleagues who make such predictions is to go to buy side instead of hoping from UBS to Dresdner Kleinwort to BNP Paribas to SocGen.

Rossi is sipping whiskey at EVR, a midtown club part-owned by another Bitcoin evangelist, Charlie Shrem, which has made much of being the first New York bar to accept the currency. Shrem, at just 23, might be one of the youngest “Bitcoin millionaires”, having amassed his stash long before the latest price surge, and set up one of the first Bitcoin payments-processing companies, BitInstant. His habit of wearing a ring engraved with the codes to his Bitcoin wallet has gained him plenty of adoring press, which he is milking to promote the club.
Also propping up the bar is Kirill Gourov, a 21-year-old currently interning at a mutual fund while completing his finance course at Baruch. He proposes a back-of-an-envelope valuation for the entire stock of Bitcoin: $70bn, or $3,000-plus per “coin”, even if it is used for just 1 per cent of the transactions in the $7tn black market. (He emails several days later with a more thoughtful calculation, based on the value of a country’s monetary base relative to its GDP.)
It seems less than a coincidence that Rossi and Shrem both have nightclubs on their résumés. After moving from the West Coast to New York “as you do, to find yourself”, Rossi flitted from venture to venture, which included promoting club nights. Gourov, too, tried his hand at this in college and grins when it is suggested that Bitcoin, like a nightclub, needs its promoters; that like a nightclub, it needs “buzz” if it is to grow in value. “Even if there are only 10 people in the club,” he says, “you want to have 100 people outside. Bitcoin has that built in. Scarcity means value.”
It was Rossi’s idea that Bitcoin fans should gather regularly in Union Square to trade in the style of the early brokers who founded the New York Stock Exchange under a buttonwood tree in 1792. Men in their twenties or thirties now gather, largely indistinguishable from the other students, tourists and hangers-on who throng the square – except that every now and again two of them swap Bitcoin addresses on their smartphones and someone hands over a hundred dollar bill.
Who on earth are the buyers of Bitcoin? Typically, they cast themselves as long-term investors. Evan True, a 29-year-old scenery builder, sees the potential for Bitcoin “as a tool, particularly where it can start to stab a screwdriver into the rusty ol’ tanks of the international banking system”. He says he is not “starry-eyed”, though. “It has some of the emotional aspects of a Ponzi scheme. Without needing to steal from someone.”
The temptation of making a fast buck repeatedly proves irresistible. At Union Square, a Wall Street banker who wants to be quoted under the pseudonym Moses, claims to be making money going in and out of the currency, following trading patterns that are revealed by plotting the Bitcoin price on a logarithmic scale. He has “never seen anything grow this fast, except bacteria when I studied biology”. He makes the analogy again for anyone who asks.
Even those attracted to Bitcoin by the beauty of the technology can’t seem to escape the lure of the lucre. Jonathan Warren, a computer science graduate who lectured on “the basics of Bitcoin” at a recent meet-up, experimented with arbitraging the dollar prices on different Bitcoin exchanges, but did not find it profitable. A friend who set up a computer program, or bot, to run the same trading strategy electronically found himself out of pocket, too, Warren says, because exchanges have gone under, leaving digital profits in limbo. Such disasters are legion, with digital wallets failing and exchanges shutting down unexpectedly.
For every person who wears their Bitcoin riches on their sleeve, there are others who sheepishly admit that the currency is not proving a one-way bet. Even Rossi, it emerges, may be down on the deal since buying into Bitcoin in January, a full year after he began investigating ways to make money from the currency. Though he bought his first Bitcoin at just $19, a sixth of the current price, he forayed into options trading and says an ill-timed investment means he has lost some of the $5,000 he has put in.
In London, the UK’s most prominent Bitcoin evangelist is fighting for its future. Amir Taaki’s ire is directed at the “suits” from venture capital and at the Bitcoin Foundation. Taaki is angry about a single body becoming “a monopoly”. “They’re suits and bullies, trying to remove Bitcoin’s political agenda, but that’s impossible,” he says. Like many others, he cites a reference to bank bailouts embedded in the currency’s original code by the creator as evidence that it is inherently political.
A former professional poker player from Kent, Taaki was expelled from school for hacking, and with his quirkily styled hair he cuts an unconventional figure as a spokesman. There is respect for his achievements as an influential coder and project developer, including his work on Intersango, London’s only Bitcoin exchange, which was subsequently shut down by the banks. But his unapologetic support for using the currency to subvert government controls makes some people uneasy.
“If you truly think that Bitcoin is something amazing you have to want to defend its integrity completely, like what Cody Wilson is doing with the [3D-printed] gun … That’s why it’s very important we try not to look up to the old hierarchy, and build our own system independently. Bitcoin is a decentralised, black market economy where you can buy drugs online and avoid tax and that undermines so much power. Anyone who tries to deny Bitcoin is revolutionary is living in fantasy,” he says.
Amir Taaki is the best-known resident of the self-styled “Bitcoin HQ”, a squat in a former commercial building in central London. It is here that, at the height of the buying frenzy in April, people converged to trade Bitcoin. On the wall a scrawl of marker pen denounces the financial status quo.
One of the newest residents is Jonathan Harrison, who swivels round in his chair and points to his screen, showing an app – WhatsKash – he is developing to transfer Bitcoin. Formerly a gold day-trader, he began buying Bitcoin two years ago and this March gave up his flat and sold his possessions to begin squatting. “I was evangelising to everyone I could speak to,” he says. “All my friends thought I was mad. ‘Go and buy your magic beans,’ they said. But I was vindicated this year.”
Harrison is one of the organisers of the London Bitcoin meet-ups, regular get-togethers in a Paddington pub that have grown from five people to 50 – tech fans, the curious and, lately, he says, quite a few “suits” from financial industries.
. . .
Mihai Alisie, a 25-year-old former professional poker player from Romania and now editor of Bitcoin magazine, has visited Bitcoin communities around the world, including in Israel, Athens and Cyprus. “I think there are two main poles in Bitcoin: Europe and the USA. Europe is more anarchic. There is a more legal and organised approach from the US, seen with the Bitcoin Foundation.”
As lawmakers, regulators and the police start to take a closer interest in Bitcoin, these poles are starting to push apart. Bitcoin adherents are facing choices. Will they tack to their governments’ laws in order to build businesses around the currency and get it into the mainstream? The claim that it can be both mainstream and black market – like any other sort of money – seems more of a stretch after recent developments in the US. Citing rules designed to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing, the US federal government has seized bank accounts belonging to Mt Gox, the largest Bitcoin exchange, and other exchanges. The Bitcoin Foundation no longer expects Mark Karpeles, Mt Gox chief executive, to travel to the US from Japan for its board meetings.
Erik Voorhees, founder of an online gambling site called SatoshiDice, whose players pay in Bitcoin, has already moved to Panama City. He is no stranger to uprooting: previous addresses have included Dubai, where he worked as an estate agent, and New Hampshire, as part of a libertarian project to “colonise” the tiny US state. Panama has the potential to become a Bitcoin hub in the way that Gibraltar became the jurisdiction of choice for online poker sites when the US acted to drive out internet gaming.
The Bitcoin Foundation’s chairman, Peter Vessenes, who runs Seattle-based CoinLab, says he hugged Voorhees and others from Panama when he saw them at Bitcoin 2013 in San Jose, the foundation’s inaugural US conference, attended by 1,300 people. “They are great entrepreneurs,” says Vessenes, “they have beautiful women follow them wherever they go, they are well dressed. All I wanted them to do was have a sane approach to US regulatory policy. I’ll maybe have to travel to them in a few years.”
For all the hugs, there are philosophical, legal and even technological fights brewing. CoinLab is suing Mt Gox over the alleged failure to consummate a partnership deal covering the US. “I personally believe that regulation is not a bad thing,” says Vessenes. “There is absolutely no world in which the large Bitcoin exchanges won’t be regulated. It’s just not going to happen. Mt Gox is clearing $1bn a month. Someone is going to want to know who gets that money.”

As I recall, Argentina wasn't simply printing pesos. They kept borrowing more and more hard currency abroad. Everybody saw that default was imminent, but were only trying to guess when... This was the first sovereign default where credit default swaps got traded a lot. Every time the government sold new bonds (mostly USD, but also other hard currencies, little local), in order to pay the previous bonds and other expenses, the yield climbed higher - in sync with local currency interest rates and CDS spread. I recall right before the default, annualized interest rate was over 70%.

A recent flashpoint has been the escalating amount of gambling traffic from Voorhees’ business and others. This has vastly increased the amount of data stored in the blockchain, which threatens to become unwieldy. Increasingly, the community is having to weigh up Bitcoin fixes and upgrades that might have a significant impact on people’s businesses.
And the transatlantic split grows. From London, Taaki scoffs at the recent Bitcoin 2013 conference; he is planning a November gathering in Vienna called “UNsystem”, where he says he will fill the conference hall with “thousands of anarchists, squatters and radicals”.
Mohan’s prediction is that regulators will be persuaded to accommodate successful Bitcoin businesses, rather than to crush them, and he predicts that the illicit and the licit Bitcoin economies can coexist, just as dollars can be used for fair purchases or foul.
Meanwhile, his New York meet-up group is about fattening up his Rolodex, “creating a professional network I can draw on when I actually do my let’s-make-money-business”. Mohan says he has a Bitcoin idea up his sleeve that he isn’t revealing yet. He’ll be graduating at the end of the year, but before then “my whole summer’s going to be Bitcoin”.
But if the community splinters, if the suits don’t win their battle to move it into the mainstream and if the US government moves in to shut this experiment down, which way will the entrepreneur jump?
He smiles. “I hear Bolivia is awesome.”

The rise of virtual currencies
When Preet Bharara, US attorney for the southern district of New York, unveiled charges against the creators of a virtual currency called Liberty Reserve last month, he proposed an update to an old law enforcement adage – “follow the virtual money”, writes Stephen Foley.
Costa Rica-based Liberty Reserve enabled what Bharara alleges is the biggest money laundering scam ever prosecuted, with $6bn going into and back out of the currency in a way that made it hard to trace.
It is the threat of criminals washing their ill-gotten gains which most exercises authorities around the world. An earlier currency called e-gold was also shut down by US action.
We have seen non-governmental currencies before. Airmiles began life as a payment method for flights and expanded into a currency that could be spent on hotel stays and other travel goodies. More recently, Facebook has experimented with “credits” for use within its network of online games, and Amazon is rolling out “coins” for payments within Kindle apps. There is a whole economy within the multiplayer game World of Warcraft, where “gold” can buy you swords and superpowers.
But what makes the latest iteration of virtual currency alarming to the authorities is the possibility of switching your stash back into real-world money, in a way that might not be captured through the traditional, regulated banking system.
This is a particular problem with so-called distributed currencies – including Bitcoin, but also half-a-dozen others including Litecoin, Namecoin and now a new rival called Ripple. With distributed currencies, transactions are processed and recorded across a network of users’ computers and balances are stored on a user’s hard drive rather than in a seizable bank account.
Entrepreneurs see in distributed currencies an opportunity to shake up the global payments business and land a few blows on the duopoly of Visa and MasterCard. Transferring money across a peer-to-peer computer network costs a fraction of what those giant money movers charge.
Government officials have been careful not to damn virtual currencies outright, for fear of squashing innovation that could benefit commerce and consumers. Instead, they are homing in on the exchange businesses which swap real money into virtual currency, and insisting that these impose the same money-laundering checks as banks.
It is a tension Bharara acknowledges. “The internet is an amazing gift,” he says, “but it also has an ugly underbelly.”
How Bitcoin works
Bitcoin aims to make storing and transferring money cheaper, simpler and anonymous. Your stash of Bitcoins is held, not in a bank account, but in a piece of software called a digital wallet on your laptop or smartphone. To pay for something in Bitcoin, or to transfer money to another person, you send a code from your wallet to theirs.
Behind the scenes, every Bitcoin ever created, and every Bitcoin transfer made, is recorded in a huge string of code called the blockchain, stored on a network of computers known as miners. These are so called because, in return for completing workmanlike computational tasks, their owners get Bitcoins credited to their accounts.

See also   "Digital Currency: Virtual reality may exist only in science fiction, but consumers now are able to purchase goods and services with virtual money such as Bitcoin, PP Coin and other digital currencies. Unlike traditional coinage, these alternatives typically are not backed by tangible assets, are not issued by a governmental authority and are subject to little or no regulation. The value of Bitcoins and other digital currencies is highly volatile and the concept behind the currency is difficult to understand even for sophisticated financial experts given the complicated mathematical algorithms that determine when new blocks of coins will be released. This environment has provided fertile ground for scam artists to capitalize on the increasing popularity and acceptance of digital currencies. Investors should be aware that investments that incorporate abstract money systems present very real risks, including the possibility of virtual reality leaving an investor virtually broke."

Famed Trader Joe Lewis Backs Bitcoin
By HARRIET AGNEW
Joe Lewis, a billionaire foreign-exchange trader who teamed up with hedge-fund manager George Soros in 1992 to bet against the Bank of England, is the latest high-profile financier to throw his weight behind the virtual currency called bitcoin.
Mr. Lewis leads the Phoenix Fund, a Zurich-based private-equity fund that on Tuesday plans to invest $200 million in Avalon, a company that makes computer servers aimed at creating bitcoins, according to people familiar with the situation.
Bitcoin is a virtual currency that exists online and isn't backed by any government or central bank. Bitcoins were invented in 2008 by a computer programmer who goes by the pseudonym Satoshi Nakamoto, who describes it as a peer-to-peer electronic cash system.
The Phoenix Fund's investment in Avalon reflects the growing popularity of virtual currencies, which are also coming under scrutiny from regulators. Other bitcoin enthusiasts include Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, who are best known for their role in the creation of Facebook Inc. FB -2.10% They have proposed an exchange-traded fund that is tied to bitcoins.
Bitcoins are created through a process called mining, in which computers solve complex mathematical algorithms to earn the bitcoins. The total number of bitcoins that can be mined is limited to 21 million. There are now about 11.5 million bitcoins in circulation, according to Blockchain, a website that monitors bitcoin transactions.
The Phoenix deal will also involve Taiwanese microchip maker Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co., 2330.TW 0.00% which is set to supply the state-of-the-art microchips that will power the hardware.
The Phoenix Fund was set up this year to invest in bitcoin mining-hardware companies. It looked at several of Avalon's rivals in the sector, including Butterfly Labs and KnCMiner but decided against investing, according to a person familiar with the private-equity firm's strategy.
Investors in the Phoenix Fund, which includes a small number of individuals who made their fortunes in currency trading, believe that the currency will become more stable and popular if more parties are involved in the mining process, this person said.
Mr. Lewis moved into currency trading in the 1980s and 1990s. In September 1992, Mr. Lewis teamed up with Mr. Soros to bet on sterling crashing out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism, an event that was later named "Black Wednesday." Mr. Lewis didn't respond to a request for comment.
Mr. Lewis had big losses investing in U.S. brokerage firm Bear Stearns Cos, in which he began amassing a stake during 2007, The Wall Street Journal reported at the time.
Mr. Lewis is the main investor in an unlisted company called Tavistock Group, which has investments in more than 200 companies across the globe.
Tavistock Group includes ENIC Group, which has a Bahamas-registered subsidiary called ENIC International Ltd., through which Mr. Lewis owns 85% of the shares in U.K. soccer club Tottenham Hotspur.
The Phoenix Fund is independent of Tavistock.
The bitcoin deal was put together by Andrew Laurus, a former government-bonds salesman at Lehman Brothers who is also an investor in the fund. Avalon was set up by Yifu Guo, a pioneer in the bitcoin-mining industry. He was part of the team that developed the first ASIC bitcoin mining hardware. ASIC stands for application-specific integrated circuit, a type of custom-designed microchip. Mr. Guo couldn't be reached for comment.
Separately, Coinflash, a company that planned to set up kiosks for bitcoin enthusiasts to buy the virtual currency, is shutting down before it even opened its doors. "Due to an unforeseen change in our personal circumstances, we've made the difficult decision to suspend Coinflash's services indefinitely," the San Diego-based company said in an email statement.
Coinflash was established earlier this year and had planned to open the bitcoin kiosks in California and New York this summer.
As part of the deal, Avalon will gain access to TSMC microchips based on 20-nanometer processes, which are much faster than other chips. TSMC recently won a contract to supply chips to Apple. The increased processing power should give Avalon an edge in solving the algorithms that control the supply of bitcoins.

Yes, I think it is. Here we have the person who's likely to be the next Fed chair talking explicitly about Bitcoin (as opposed to LR and other stuff that has little Bitcoin relevance).
And what she's saying is important too - when central banks consider the risks of something or other, they're likely to do something about it.

The title is kind of accurate. new regulation requires various market participants (hf's, banks) to jump through hoops and do new shit, mostly useless, that they wouldn't be doing unless required by the regulators. Vendors and consultants who help market participants get this new shit done can make a shitload of money.
The article should have pointed out that if people weren't required to do this useless shit, then they'd be doing something more useful and fun.
