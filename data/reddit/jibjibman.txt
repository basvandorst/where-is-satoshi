I like the site code, its nice and responsive and all that jazz, but im really not digging the actual designs on any of them. Everything is very cluttered I find, may I suggest looking into hiring a professional designer for your team? You definitely have the coding chops though. 
Maybe its not even the design, maybe work on the content or someone that specializes in writing the content, just to get your messages across better.

Better safe than sorry. Also I'd suggest moving away from vos

Then remove the image you moron... people already said they can reverse the blurring on your post. Do you read?

No hype. I own the dev kits and develop for them and actually do my research. The hololens is no where near consumer ready and won't be for a long time. And show me something google has done? Valve and oculus on the other hand are going to be huge for vr. You're a moron.
@_date: 2015-07-27 03:16:14
Sure thing kid
@_date: 2015-07-27 01:32:06
Microsoft nor google are developing any good vr competitors. Oculus and valve are going to own the Vr market
@_date: 2015-07-27 01:22:30
Yea no, that won't be happening.
@_date: 2015-07-27 02:47:19
Lmao. You really don't know much about current VR do you. Go back to trolling r/politics.

Most vendors convert bitcoin to USD automatically, and I assume they have their price listed so they always get the correct amount of USD. I assume some shops do not though, so they "could" be taken advantage of.

That gave me a good chuckle going through his comment history!

You probably should of sent it quicker and had them set up to transfer it into normal cash. Don't buy this thinking it will stay stable right now, although it most likely will hit back at 1000 + .

Man that's ridiculous, good on you man, Merry christmas to you!

Are their credit unions in Canada as well? Specifically in Nova Scotia? I like not getting screwed.

You think this will work with any canadian debit card? Im with PC Financial, so hopefully it can work. Do they sell bitcoins at current market price as well? 
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:33:12
Thanks! Im going to set up a wallet with Armoury when I get home and then see if I can buy some bitcoins!

Bitcoins are awesome, so is this bitcoin bot. Didn't you could tip gold as well! (inb4 price of actual gold)

Someone want to help a fellow canadian get set up? From my understanding coinbase doesn't work for us and online wallet storage seems very insecure with all of these thefts. 
Anyone want to point me in the right direction ?

What bubble? There is no bubble.

Wow, thanks a lot man, I really appreciate it! Seems I will need to go the localbitcoin route of getting some, as quickBT doesn't work for me due to not having an interact ready bank card here in Canada. Going to try my luck with the other exchanges over the next few days.

Gota love america. Hope you get the surgery you need man, and welcome to the bitcoin community!
