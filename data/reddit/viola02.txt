13% upvoted?  Either this community is really brainless, or there are government downvote brigades here to quell any political resistance to tyranny.  My guess is the latter.

Can't believe people watch this propaganda.

Yeah decentralized markets like Open Bazaar, and Shadow Market will be coming out soon and be ready for primetime.  Then they can never be shut down.  Although drug use can be dangerous, tyranny is more dangerous.  The drug war prohibition kills far more people and ruins far more lives than drugs do.
Edit:  The drug War also  improves the lives of law enforcement and government agents who get giant salaries and bonuses to lock the non-violent people in cages.  This is why the end of prohibition is taking so long to arrive.

It seems like it could be a scam, especially from the slides.  No way the end user is going to derive any worthwhile value here.  The slides seem kind of gimmicky to trick investors.  But I suggest the possibility that this is some type of trojan horse.  They get their chips in every device world wide, and they control the chips.  Everyone is mining for them, its like a giant bot-net.  Then the decentralized Bitcoin suddenly becomes centralized in their control.  Now you can see why they might have so much investor money.

Truecrypt canary went off a while ago.  I was wondering when the NSAcrypt replacement would be coming out.

They will be parasite miners....Mining off of the devices of all the people.  Using their corporate connections to put their parasite chip in your device.

I think a lot of altcoins are scams.  I think some of them offer value, like anonymity or more privacy.  But there are a lot of shenanigans going on, and for this reason I really dislike coins like Monero and Dash.  I think ShadowCash is a more solid anonymous currency project with none of the shenanigans.  I really like the cryptonote whitepaper, it is very genius, but I dislike how Monero only became the  cryptonote coin by cloning and then spreading lies about bytecoin.  Dash has a lot of questionable history as well.
Hopefully an honorable alt-coin project will rise to promote anonymity and privacy.  I believe it will be ShadowCash.  They also have encrypted messaging already, and a decentralized marketplace soon to be launched within their HTML5 wallet interface.  Its really the only alt-coin I can feel good about at this time.

Probably only done because of the publicity of the case, so then the government lovers can claim there is no tyranny happening.

This is why America is in so much trouble.  You really do not understand the subject of the article???  Its amazing the level of ignorance.  You are attacking a complete strawman.  The OP never said Bitcoin means no taxes, how is your comment upvoted?  Its insanity.  The OP said that with Bitcoin your account cannot be seized for fake reasons given by the government.  Wake up people.

Prepare to be downvoted by government lovers, and tyranny sympathizers.

Your comment does not make any sense at all.  Ross Ulbricht was running a giant multi-million dollar website that trafficked illegal things.  This 22 year old was riding a train with cash so he could move out of state and start a music career.  One was breaking the law, the other was not.  Why is this so hard to understand?

Yeah they will give him life in prison.  The whole trial was a sham, just to make an example to scare and intimidate people.  That is why they will throw the book at him.  The judge wouldn't even let the defense defend during trial.
One day he will be out of jail though, on a presidential pardon.  This is very likely to happen if Rand Paul becomes president.

Wow, thats horrible.  Will not be using them anymore if this is true.
