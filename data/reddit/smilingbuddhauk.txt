Do you see the contradiction in your question?
If bitcoin takes over "current currency" there would be no need to reference it to the extinct dollar any more.

No, but the naysayers become just as sad and cunty as Trump.

@_date: 2019-07-16 08:24:59
I think they were saying that with a straight face, with a missing /s. They probably thought that OP must've known what his friend actually gave him. They probably gave OP the benefit of doubt like I'm giving them. Who would actually think that's an actual bitcoin (among those savvy enough to post to r/bitcoin), leave alone think that somebody else thought that?
@_date: 2019-07-16 08:18:50
That is a big %!!
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:40:45
Plot twist: most people holding the most bitcoin now are institutional investors, aka wealthy republicans. Those hypocrites will follow the money trail whether they believe in the ethos and the tech or not.

Yes, the short answer is yes, ignoring the foaming at the mouth by some folks. Obviously you don't mean legit as it legally ordained but legit as in true, so yes, it is true that those handles/subs generally correspond to those communities, and yes, it is confusing.

@_date: 2019-07-14 01:34:29
That's because no one uses the term market cap in the bullion world so it reduces to a nearest neighbour association from market cap to gold and crypto

@_date: 2019-07-07 17:12:48
Ok, your loss. I don't know about ICOs, but ETH, LTC and maybe XRP obviously offer sufficient value to their users to keep them at the top of the market cap charts. Not like Madoff or any other scam in the least bit.

I never bought into this "banking for the unbanked" argument for bitcoin - there are so many other better arguments. Most countries have the option of opening bank accounts for free. In fact, in many developing countries, there are active schemes by the government and public sector banks to encourage people to do so.

Wrong, I know many who've made quite the profit with altcoins, esp the eth and ltc runs in 2017 that outpaced btc's and was actually way closer to the moon. I was not one of them and regret it to this day. The time tested mantra of portfolio diversification is as true in the crypto space as anywhere else, at least as much as the dca dogma is.

It's called redistribution and social justice. If they relied on your own income for your social security benefit, most people would get squat. Have some compassion and appreciation for the fact that you got to where you are _because_ of the social rules, not _despite_ it. Sometimes these faux libertarian rants by old folks make them sound like rebellious teenagers who never stopped raging against and blaming the system.

What are the tax implications? If you're trading with the intention to make a profit, and you make *any* profit at all, the tax is a percentage of your profits, so you still end up making a net profit. If you don't end up making a profit, there are no capital gains and hence no tax. It's a win-not lose scenario.

How is that "dirt"?
Obviously he realises it is too late to "scam"/convince people to believe in Theranos at this stage of the game? When it's a pile of rubble and the forensic experts are deconstructing what went wrong?
So if he still maintains it was a good company with potential he probably actually has reason to believe it or was shown selective information to convince him of their vision and good intentions? That makes him neither a scammer himself nor an incompetent fool. Just someone with enough conviction to inform their own opinion.
Not everyone that says something that goes against what the rest of the world believes to be facts is automatically a fraud. Context matters, and a simple consideration for why they might expose themselves to be called out at this stage may help us understand the other viewpoint.

Maybe his skill is judging people quickly by their demeanour, overall body language, etc. And it's not that hard to estimate the size and shape of things people have in their pockets if you're a visual person. Both fall under the umbrella term "ocular patdown" as someone else has mentioned. So he's using the skills he has to do the job he's paid to do, and under the aforementioned premise, doing it pretty well. Ergo, this whole back and forth debate/discussion about minimum wage/skills/you get what you pay for, etc. is moot.

Oft-repeated but useless advice. Finding who someone is from their username and then going to target them physically is like solving a needle in a haystack problem and then travelling to mars because the haystack is in mars. Sounds like a lot of effort for a bitcoin, or even several. 
Put another way, you know many people are going to have savings of 10K,100K, 1M, etc. in whatever local currency. Why not pick random people on internet or real life and start targeting them? Pretty good chance you'll land the jackpot, no? People still don't do it because it is 1) risky 2) hard 3) crazy.

They're talking about inflation. If bitcoin reached $100000 overnight something probably went seriously wrong and the USD lost 90% lost all its value (not that bitcoin went up 10x). So they would check the price of bread because this means bread would be $30 instead of $3 and can be used as an indicator of disarray. Not a flex at all but a very common concept in popular economics.

According to every single chart I've seen, it went from ~7200 to ~8500 around 9AM EDT on Oct 25, stayed at ~8500 for a few hours, then shot up again to ~10100 around 9PM.

They're talking about inflation. If bitcoin reached $100000 overnight something probably went seriously wrong and the USD lost 90% lost all its value (not that bitcoin went up 10x). So they would check the price of bread because this means bread would be $30 instead of $3 and can be used as an indicator of disarray. Not a flex at all but a very common concept in popular economics.

Anyway, point was it is not exactly intuitive to anyone but maybe some experts that phones which are constantly mobile and connected to the internet are more secure than actual computers. Plus you're only secure as your practices. If you have your private key stored on a text app because someone on the internet said iphones are the most secure devices on the planet, your phone is no more secure than broadcasting your keys on the internet.

Nope, I don't trade in shitcoin or post on reddit of all places for help. What I do have is a view on such trades. If a btc hodl position is outside the purview of the taxman, all logic dictates that a hodl position on another form of currency (which may be more or less valuable than bitcoin) is also outside that purview. If the IRS disagrees, they can go to court where presumably logic will triumph. This mindset of quaking in one's boots at the mere mention of the IRS needs to stop and people need to start using their better judgement.

I get the spirit behind the comment, except the fiat supply is technically not infinite, is it? That is, right now, there is a finite amount of USD in circulation. Next year, there may/will be slightly more USD, but still finite, and so on. So while the supply is not capped like bitcoin and is mathematically unbounded, it is practically finite in anyone's lifetime and only asymptotically approaches infinity (based on today's printing policies). Same is true for most other fiat currencies, except the ones that exhibited runaway behaviour in a short time due to the fiat authority's daftness.

So? You know taxes on anything is just a fraction of the thing itself right? And if the thing is positive, like profit/capital gains, and taxes are a fraction, you're still profiting as a whole right? So wgaf about taxes?

You mean reddiquette? Regardless, someone not following nebulous reddiquette is not a reason for you to break basic life etiquette. Don't say things you wouldn't say to someone irl when they ask you a question, however basic or silly.

"The only people in California able to afford homes right now are... people who took massive debt to enroll in graduate school." 
"The market is oversaturated with Bachelor degrees now and employers are not motivated to pay..." 
These lines are inconsistent with your claim in OP that higher education is risky and does not guarantee higher income.

I agree, that's the unfortunate part. Hence the concept of a completely free market is inherently flawed as the stable solution will be unfair to the majority, it allows for runaway winners.
@_date: 2019-05-15 15:52:01
Ignore the others, sounds perfectly legal to me. Like you yourself said, what happens to the crypto in a different jurisdiction after you've already paid capital gains taxes on all or part of it that should be paid is none of the IRS' business.
The notion that the legality of this hinges on whether you ask this question or do this without asking is absurd. People are confusing non-naivete with criminal intent.
@_date: 2019-05-26 17:26:15
Why is asking a question about that a reason to downvote? Is reddit stupid?

Ok, thought as much, but then isn't your public key also "public" to all if you're walking around with a qr code?
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:38:45
The other reason is as a joke, with the expectation of hitting the sweet spot of humorous insight for a few at best, and being ignored at worst, but that's expecting better from a community of hormonal Male juveniles. You're saying there's so little possibility of OP being a she it isn't even worth pointing out in passing like in so many other reddit threads/comments. And I'm the one with a blinkered view and a drain on "any" community, not someone who thinks women can't accumulate or regret the loss of bitcoins.
Anyhow, thanks for teaching a new fancy word - entryism, I guess.

This. Best analysis I have seen.
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:19:51
Nope, the producers will follow the "majority" in terms of net economic benefit to them, not raw people numbers. The wealth distribution in most societies follows some heavy-tailed distribution, e.g. Pareto's distribution. 20% of the population (a minority by any standards) will have 80% of the wealth/means (what producers care about), and will therefore control the prices. Whether you consider that fair or unfair depends on how much you believe in one kind of freedom of a "free" market over other human values.

It's not an assumption if it is validated by kneejerk reactions to a farking joke, that's just the scientific method. Note that said "assumption" did not originate anything, it was preceded by and was in reaction to the glut of unwarranted nastiness which can only come from the subjects of said assumption.
