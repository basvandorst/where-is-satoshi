Restrictions for currency outflow were made in Iceland in 2008, it was not lifted until 2016, but we had auroracoin in 2014, but everybody sold it, it went from 2000kr to 4kr in half a year. I am not seeing as much people buying bitcoin though, people have such a goldfish memory it is like the currency controls were never there because everything is fine now after the tourist boom, they are still fine putting their eggs in one basket. Too me they are just living in the illusion of stability that society has built up, nature is chaotic and we could even have a volcanic eruption tomorrow and the icelandic currency could turn into a shitcoin in a week if nature goes full beastmode.

yep, just for an example, people talk about "I should have bought more bitcoin" while binance token has done better, gone from 4.6-42USD , that is much better return on your investment percentage wise then buying bitcoin at 3,3 and selling at 13,7

Yeah, but when you think about it, its all just percentages really.

Maybe you need to express more, putting things out in the open is often very refreshing and relieving.

Not a good bet .. uh.. buying at 6-20k...

Bitcoin is maybe generally not a good bet, but everything has its time and right now bitcoin is in its low part in the price cycle.

Hmm, how do you know it is people being liquidated from margin longs and not just people market selling their bitcoin.
