No, that's not what I said. I wrote 3 paragraphs and you had to resort to a TLDR.
Point being is *yes* - uninformed people flocking by the millions to any asset are going to make a bubble out of it.
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:01:24
No to this also. That's like rule  of crypto, control your keys.
People need to get it through their head that until adoption occurs, it is every *individuals* responsibility to *learn* how to store and/or use safely.
There is no 'reputable' exchange yet, they are all new and developing the landscape. Use the exchanges only as needed and then pull the coins off the exchange and into a secure wallet. Learn how to do this or stay away from bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:49:47
You did witness the 30% drop recently, did you not?
People calling bitcoin a bubble are not wholly incorrect when bitcoin goes week after week of unchecked increases in valuation. A correction *is* due regardless of whether or not the technology has staying power. It inflates, pops, and then inflates *further*.
This is the nature of a *speculative market*. Wide margins of volatility due to a wide margin in the psychological landscape of evaluators. If you know nothing of Bitcoin and cannot understand it, it is worthless, while on the other hand if you can recognize the potential benefits of the technology you see validity in 100k predictions.
So is Bitcoin a bubble? Yes and no, it will continue to inflate and pop intermittently as adoption occurs, but it is not going to 'pop' proper and go to 0. So while comparisons to tulips are understandable and appear apt to people who see just as much utility in crypto currencies as they do in flowers, they are ultimately erroneous and ill informed.

Don't invest in a hardware wallet to store a couple hundred dollars worth of Bitcoin. First learn how to do a secure paper wallet with backups, and if and when you start accumulating a sizeable amount of Bitcoin, *then* you invest in a hardware wallet.

He simply exemplifies the paradigm shift. As smart as people are, their ignorance and inexperience with technology will necessarily inhibit their ability to predict the turns of tech like bitcoin.
He doesn't understand it, and therefore isn't reassured it is *worthy* of this level of support via investment. He doesn't see how the gains can be sustained, so he calls it a mirage.
I'm not trying to be insulting, but Warren Buffet is both an established financier as well as *an old man*. The former doesn't negate the latter, old people are generally out of touch with trends in technology and are inhibited from seeing the *truths* that's those versed in the field see.

That's a pretty specific scenario to find yourself *opting* to leave your coins on Coinbase, I'd avoid that in the future if I were you...
But you always have the option to port your crypto out of Coinbase via BCH, LTC, or ETH, and repurchase your BTC on an exchange that supports segwit and doesnt charge withdrawal fees.
Again, reinforcing the point that these exchanges are still quite malleable to the pressures of the market, and their clients demands.
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:39:37
Because the advent of blockchain technology is a paradigm shifting idea, that cannot be *un*invented. It solved a critical problem in providing traceable authenticity to a digital transaction.
This is huge. You've perhaps heard Andreas Antonopolous discussing the significance of this in comparison to email? This technology provides a very secure means of creating and perserving a transparent ledger, be that of trading coins, or transactions of "contracts". This means that micropayments, previously inefficient and impracticle for the network to utilize, can now be done to whatever scale is required, it simply takes some time and development to figure out the details of the protocols.
But these "microtransactions" can also permit microcontracts, or perhaps microvotes. So elections, which previously were a huge expense to organize and verify, can now be decided more efficiently, quickly, securely, and to whatever timeframe is required.
So again, to avoid the ocean that is a bunch of caveats and specifics and technicalities that are not for my or your concern, we will be able to vote more reliably on a world of issues that were previously held to the realm of disorganized public discourse of social media.
Citizens can document their wishes and desires for whatever legislation is tabled or considered. This can easily be weighted in a ranked voting system where you don't simply choose between a douche bag &amp; turd sandwich, but rather from primaries through to the big show you can be ranking *preferences* rather than a shallow, binary Left/Right.
Finally, even if these systems are not used in the interim to actually *decide* elections, they can reliably *poll* them and inform the electorate what *values* they truly have and what problems they want addressed. Which in turn can be used to keep tabs and rank your representatives in accordance with a clear and infallible set of 'votes'.
You are right, blockchain is thrown around without due consideration of how it is actually solving a problem in that industry. Voting is one domain it can definitely revolutionize.

They didn't *advertise* those services moron. It is a black market. Sellers would develop reputations for offering services outside the sale of fucking marijuana.
People selling illegal IDs, people selling firearms, people selling services to kill DEA agents. All this shit could be *negotiated* through the communications under the *pretense* of purchasing weed or coke.


So yeah, whether or not he intended it to happen that way, it ended up unfolding that way and he made a financial killing off of the offering of a digital blackmarket.
It would be one thing to defend him had he not tried to hire killers in what you refer to as an act of "self defense".
@_date: 2019-07-24 12:45:22
Thus why he was never tried for them. The plausible deniability is exceptionally weak, but prosecutors also knew they didn't need to pin that on him either.
But it was clearly him. The PMs refer specifically to the "mutual contact" that was trying to extort Ross.

It is "theft" when hardworking individuals have to pay for the infrastructure upon which we all use and depend.
It is "breaks" when we grant MNC's the freedom to rape, pillage and plunder all the natural resources of the planet and sell it back to us at a "healthy markup" with absolutely **ZERO** overhead to be included in maintaing that same infrastructure the corporations use and depend.
Seriously, I *empathize* with people who have the mentality that is marginally more mature than this kid feeling the defeat that is Monopoly, but taxation *is not theft*, and if you think that it is you are more than welcome to relocate to a country with little to no taxes and see what kind of *freedoms* you can enjoy there.
At the end of the day what really grinds people is the tax *inequalities*. I would care substantially less about "half my pay" going to the government if the government were collecting equal amounts from the corporations.
Oh yeah, and stop the bullshit global KYC/AML/ATF facade that is only in place to aid the *wealthy* in evading their taxes and aid the *banks* in laundering this money. Again, it is the blatant inequalities in the way these systems operate and the interests they serve that is the underlying problem.

While this is true, he *did* stoop to this activity. The fact that he didn't successfully hire any killers and no victims could be identified after the fact is the reason they didn't try him for these crimes, but instead used the PMs to demonstrate what actions and services *could* have been facilitated on the silk road beyond simply the trafficking of restricted drugs.

This isn't true of bitcoin where a secure backup can be copied and distributed into a number of locations.
Unlike most of the things that were predominantly kept in safe deposit boxes in the past, an encrypted private key is not a unique and irreplaceable artifact or tangible commodity.

Look bud, I saw your link and addressed it as irrelevant to this discussion. Discussing whether or not MLK is a *criminal* is not comparable to the discussion of whether or not taxation is theft. 
It is *not* a lofty philosophical discussion and not a ardent libertarian principle, taxation isn't *theft*, and it has 100% to do with the definition of **theft**, and not whatever fucking reasoning you apply to governments, society, and the principles of taxation at large.
Now go *discuss* whatever misunderstood points from that link with someone else who *also* mistakenly feels it is relevent to this discussion. It isn't, and I'm not humouring your nonsense.

I prefer to have a system of authority in place to at *least* keep a check on all the cannibalism.
@_date: 2019-07-31 14:41:19


But this is precisely the area where Blockchain technology is headed with governance systems.
I don't think that people in general are so selfish as to refuse taxation altogether if they were provided a means of distributing their share of tax dollars to the areas *they deem* are worthy of such investment.
With the adoption of these transparent systems which document right down to every SAT where the money is being used, you could effectively combat a lot of the waste that sours citizens to the entire process.

Until they pay more in fines than they actually invest in securing private information. So, never, likely.
You think Facebook is *motivated* by the 5 billion-dollar-fine to protect and respect their users' privacy? They made more than 5 billion dollars by abusing their customers rather than respecting them. Period. People however, are still all the fuck up on Facebook!
People need to understand, the banks care *marginally* more than all the unregulated crypto exchanges about vetting your transactions and complying with global AML/ATF/KYC practices. Likewise, the amount they care about protecting your info is directly proportional to the amount they stand to face in fines for neglecting a *government-mandated responsibility*.
Bottom line, they cost the bank money, and they do not increase profits. Banks don't care and it is all a fucking pathetic joke on par with the "war on drugs".

There is no "sort of", or "like theft" to debate. You a free to fucking relocate your ass to a country that doesn't mandate taxes, yes or no? This isn't a nuanced question about how difficult it is to pick up and leave the society *you're accustomed to*, renouncing citizenship and cutting all ties to the *theiving government* you used to reside in. This is quite literally how the cost:benefit analysis plays out in the human brain. Do I *want* to move to the UAE and renounce my American citizenship?

Yes. There are a number of individuals in this world that would love to indulge in their "individual freedoms" including the desire to maim and rape innocent people and sodomize children. Likewise, there are enough deplorable *individuals* who would be more than thrilled to utilize their crop of offspring for the anarcho-capitalistic boon that is slave labour and human trafficking.
Democracy is not some "unnatural" system of control, it emerged from an ever-changing and adapting species that recognized the net benefit of engaging in a *society of individuals* with *shared interests*, permiting specialization of skills and division of labour. It also means that while some "individual freedoms" are restricted, *individual protections* are afforded at scale.

It's hardly ironic. Despite the frequent claim, cryptocurrencies were not created to *eliminate* banks. They were created to eliminate the *requirement* of transacting through a "trusted" third party.
This is how blockchain is going to impact banks, their invention is going to create a new demand for *trusted custody solutions*.
Security is a very serious matter, and most people neglect to consider all the angles. If you want to keep the keys to yourself and have the ability to move millions of dollars in a reasonably immediate period of time, that is understandable, but also entails certain risks and vulnerabilities.
If someone else knows that you and you *alone* possess the means of sending large sums of money, that is a vulnerability that can be exploited by force. A *protection* to this would be multisig and/or a custody solution.
Backups to your seed should first, *always be encrypted.* If you are leaving a backup in a safe deposit box, you have to assume that the bank both *can* open it without your key, and *cannot* open it without your key in the event that you lose it. Thus the need to secure your seed with strong encryption and *preferably* a tamper-evident seal, but also have multiple copies in the event any particular one is lost/destroyed.

Problems with the governmental systems we have adopted does not equate to "taxes are theft". There are ways of fixing the wasted tax dollars without resorting to systems we long ago abandonned.

The same is true of corporations. They develop bloat and inefficiencies that eventually need to be cut in order to appease the stock holders.
This is where the difference lies. The government is elected by the citizens in the elections we hold, it is much easier to sway a population of voters that these particular costs and expenses over here can be disregarded than it is to convince a board of few dozen people that there isn't any money being left on the table. 
The board of directors is clearly *incentivized* to make sure spending if efficient. Citizens on the other hand, are substantially more gullible and substantially less incentivized to vote for the necessary changes in government to ensure spending is done *fiscally* and taxation is kept in check.
So then, why do we consistently afford corporations tax breaks when they threaten to take their business and production force to another country? Why can we not collectively agree not to do any business with corporations that refuse to *invest* in the infrastructure we *all* use and depend upon?

As someone who also bought weed on the silk road before it was legal in my country, yes, he should be given a sentence proportional to the crimes that he committed, which included contracting someone on his own fucking platform to kill people.
Maybe if you're going to operate a digital blackmarket to fight what you feel to be injustices of the wasteful war on drugs, you should reconsider opening that platform up to people offering to kill others for the right sum of money.

How about you a start with the definition of *theft* rather than accusing people of utilizing logical fallacies.
Taxation *isn't* theft, that is quite sincerely the extent of thought that is afforded to the argument.

BCH is a fork of Bitcoin and just as legitimate as the next closest competitor to BTC. If you think BCH is "his coin", you are just as retarded as you claim Ver is.
Also, people - particularly newcomers - need to recognize that there is still a lot of unmoved BTC out there that has yet to generate the forks, BCH, BTG, BSV, etc. Even if they were to agree with you that it is a "shitcoin", they are likely not above selling those off and pocketing the "free money". They cannot do this if they are removed from exchanges. For example, I just unloaded a couple dozen BSV recently. At ~$200 each that is $4800 I am thrilled to collect. Apparently you would rather see that at $0 because you likely hate Faketoshi as much a Ver. You're all caught up in the fucking bullshit between ideologues who don't have enough understanding of the underlying technology to have *confidence in it*. To you, it is all just a game of hype and "leaders".
Lastly, why do you even care? BCH has yet to demonstrate it can *survive* a bubble, it is valued no higher now than it was immediately after the fork. In fact, it is *lower*.
@_date: 2019-07-31 18:04:49
Haha, yes there most certainly is! Let the corporations leave and sell solely to the Chinese or whatever markets they can gain access to. In the vacuum of corporations seeking to exploit for profit *on their terms*, you will see an opportunistic new set of corporations emerge willing to work within the mandated guidelines of the untapped - albeit regulated - market.
You're a fool if you think people are destined to always be slaves to the corporations. Corporations are nothing without *customers*. This *is* the inherent paradox I am describing. Supply and *demand* is the basics of economic principle, you don't get one without the other. If the supply leaves, that doesn't eliminate the demand, a new supply emerges to fill the void.
If you remove the demand for shitty, overpriced electronics and fighting for the right to repair your purchased goods, the supply adjusts to the new demand. *This* is the nature of relationships, a constant negotiation, making compromises rather than ultimatums.

So it is inevitably a compromise. I don't want to live like a hermit in the wilderness. I want to have access to society, therefore I comply with those legal requirements or attempt to pass legislation to change them.

Funny, because my spouse and I talk about this often. She works for the federal government, but only for a couple years and is still very passionate about what she does, so she works hard.
I worked in the field for a construction company for 20 years. Member of a union. I worked hard so that I would be recognized as a company man and kept with steady employment and given the benefit of overtime work, company vehicle, etc.
It worked, stayed with the same company for 20 years, but have since moved into the office, left the union and am now directly on the company payroll. Again, I work hard because I enjoy the benefits that all my hard work up until now has afforded me.
All along the way though, there were free-loading people who simply don't care. So I'm beginning to think that the stereotype of the lazy, do-nothing government worker is a bit overplayed compared to the lazy, drop-your-tools it's time for our union-mandated 1 hour coffee break with breakfast, mentality.
Basically, *shitty people* exploit and abuse their privileges whenever and whereever they can. Regular people should be just as annoyed by the lazy union member, or the lazy company man, as they are by the lazy government worker. But only the latter is seen as a direct insult to the taxpayer.

But just like the *government* it can become too big and powerful, leading to extortion of their "customers" when they manage to finesse a monopoly in a critical industry, such as telecommunications infrastructure.
What do you do when something is both "wanted" and "needed". People *want* options and want competition in entertainment and ISP services, etc, however society as a whole has become rather dependant upon the critical infrastructure that is communications.
So does the *need* to maintain a critical infrastructure like telecom outweigh the *want* for competition. Who can truly *compete* with the big telecom companies that have already cornered their markets and lobbied politicians to protect their monopolies?

As I said, I am specifically avoiding getting drawn into a deep dive of the technicalities, after all, I am still very much learning how some of the current governance systems work, [such as what they've deployed in Estonia.](
But for starters, implimentation of mandatory voting is likely to be a requirement, with default delegations of uncast ballots going to incumbents. One way or another they have to incentivize every person to either cast a vote, or delegate a vote to someone else who will cast it "on their behalf".
Another aspect would be to reduce the size and spectrum of federal oversight and delegate a lot of those responsibilities back down to regional and local systems. There is no need for the federal government to mandate how marijuana can be produced, distributed and consumed in California or Colorado for example.
The biggest hurdle will actually be overcoming all the neighsayers that simply refuse to adopt *any changes* because they have identified potential pitfalls with those suggested.

Yeah, I fully disagree with this. Elected officials are the source of the propaganda, influencing the consensus amongst voters into believing they would be better off to *leave the EU*, as a recent example.
If you were able to reduce the "leave/stay" vote to the minutiae that cannot be voted for in traditional elections but can be assessed with blockchain, you will get a more accurate representation of what values people truly have, and what priorities are outweighed by their illogical emotions.

Listen snowflake, I'm merely drawing attention to how silly it was to give any credence to a 'bad feeling' regarding a negligible dip in price with an asset as volatile as Bitcoin - while the US Congress is debating the next stage of economic development regarding Bitcoin, Libra, and cryptocurrencies in general.
You *qualified* your bad feeling by mentioning "I've been in this since 2015". I don't think you've developed your "sea-legs" for someone who presumably hodled through the last cycle.

Because people are selfish assholes who delude themselves into thinking they live in a bubble and whatever they *earn* should be their's to keep and do whatever they want with, regardless of the fact they are living in a democracy that demands taxation of it's citizens and regular contributions into plans that do not benefit the healthy and wealthy.
At 37k per year, over 16 years, he will see that 600k again if he lives that long. However, he prefers to think that money is *his*, and he could have invested it for an annual return of 95k (not sure how that works because it's not like he made a single contribution of 600k the first day paying into it).

A cryptocurrency will come to back global fiats, that much is almost certain. Be that bitcoin or another alternative, volatility will be eliminated as adoption occurs and the price stabilizes.
The *reason* bitcoin is *so* volatile is because it is still speculative. Once it becomes adopted you will see it stabilize just like any stock does once it has saturated the market. It will become even *more* stable than the USD is now.

Firstly, don't get caught up in all the hate being lobbed between BTC and BCH crowds. The *better* crypto will likely win out, this is the infuence of a capital market that gives precisely zero shits about your ego.
If you hold too much pride, it may blind you from the truth. You may really despise Roger Ver, but if you are too focused on hating him over seeing what the *market* sees in BCH, you will miss the opportunity when it doubles again.
From this point looking forward, with BCH around 4k and BTC around 20k CAD, which do you think is more likely to double or quadruple in the next 6 months, 12 months? I don't think either are disappearing anytime 'soon', so the only caveat I offer is think twice before you put all your eggs into on basket.

Off the topic of how pointless it is claiming "legal ownership" over bitcoin you don't possess the keys for?

Nothing to gain, he just gets asked about it, and doesn't see the value. He sees it as 100% speculation over something that *might* be useful at some point, but has not yet demonstrated any usefulness. Thus the comments that it is a bubble that will end badly for many (he's not exactly wrong about this, many unfortunate people will be rekt), or that at this point it isn't an "investment" it is simply *gambling*.
Time *will* prove him and others wrong, but what people need to remember is that with everything that has happened in the space, it is still an infant learning to walk. Those with foresight and requisite *understanding* can confidently predict the usefulness that will emerge, they can predict the paradigm shift.
This is what permits Tyler Winklevoss to have the balls to call out the second wealthiest person in the world to "bring it on" essentially. He knows that while Buffet and Gates may have support for such statements now, they won't in due time.

In this thread people appear to be confused with the issue of "ownership". 
While the thief did not *legally acquire* OP's bitcoin, they are *now* in *possession* of the private keys controlling the funds. What's the adage? [Possession is 9/10ths of the law](


So, the idealistic hope that OP can somehow provide "compelling testimony or documentation to the contrary" is grounded in ignorance. Basically you people don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Oh well, by all means, carry on with the downvoting of the facts of reality.
@_date: 2018-05-09 22:43:56
Don't be so naive, this isn't under any agencies watch or within their ability to investigate.
An investigation to determine who stole the funds and furthermore demonstrate said proof in a court of law would be more costly than what was stolen, and would require the cooperation of every nation state the thief channeled the funds through.
The hypothetical scenario you're imagining where OP engages authorities to trace the funds from one KYC-verified account on Exchange X to another KYC-verified account on Exchange Y isn't the reality, I assure you. The fact that you're even positing the notion indicates your ignorance.
So despite the fact that what happened is most certainly a crime, it is one that *will never be solved*.

To be critical of this idea simply because you cannot imagine that amount of $$$ being "given away" is remarkably ignorant. You're already giving it away every year you permit the corporations to rape your country and pocket the gains.
The US has to seriously wake up to the abusive relationship it has with the corporations, the banks, and the government. The entire system is built to benefit the select few, and keep everyone else on the margin of poverty, needing to work harder and harder to simply maintain a decent life.
The media is aiding those elites by diseminating ideas critical of such drastic changes. Beware *Socialism* everyone! Beware the promise of being handed "stuff for free".

Who elected those politicians? The corporations?
The problem is most certainly sourced back to the individuals that make up your populace. Both the corrupt ones that manipulate the system to afford benefits to the few at the expense of the majority, or the ambivalent and unengaged ones that simply become resigned to the position that no single person can make a difference.
The vast majority of your country doesn't even participate in the electoral process, so yes, you are very much responsible for permitting these "invisible forces" from curtailing such a corrupt system. It happened because you *permitted it to*.
Now, I'm not arguing for or against some specific position of $1000 per month per adult. But rather suggesting that those hypercritical of even entertaining the notion, those are the ones that will prevent any meaningful changes to a broken system.
One way or another, you need to adopt a system of policies that redistribute wealth back into the foundational levels of the economy. The longer it remains hoarded amongst the 1%, the greater the inflation, the greater the demand to raise minimum wages to combat greater costs of living. All of these solutions merely perpetuate the problem, kicking the can down the road.
This system is untenable and will eventually collapse in a spectacularly tragic fashion. People will have no faith in government or the associated institutions, and in a vacuum of authority there will most certainly be a resurgence of violence.
You all need to wake the fuck up and demand significant and *lasting* changes. If corporations threaten to leave the country, you say good riddance and don't look back. You are a nation of *consumers*, those corporations will bluff themselves into obscurity when other corporations emerge that are willing to compromise on profits in order to truly stabalize and benefit the population at large.

What do you mean your buddy told you China is "getting" bitcoin in 2020? China *has* bitcoin now, the whole world *has* bitcoin now, that is one of the benefits of a decentralized currency.
If you mean that China is going to adopt it as an official/State currency, your buddy is also mistaken. They have had some favorable things to say about bitcoin/blockchain as of late, but they are just as likely to claim they are going to ban it tomorrow (again). They will attempt to develop their own State digital currency because it is an excellent way to track their citizens and their finances. Every authoritarian state would love to have a native, centralized, auditable digital currency at their command.
Far more significant than any of China's attempts to manipulate the price, is bitcoin's halving cycle of mining rewards, the next one scheduled for May 2020.
Lastly, if you have 2k you're not using in the bank, would you be comfortable risking losing it all? Cost average in or all at once at the next available dip is somewhat irrelevant with that amount of money IMHO. More important than how much you buy and when, and at what price, is that you **invest the time to learn the technology**.

Yeah, I didn't think that required clarification, but yes...the UI *code*.


Yes, you detailed that well. But the *only* one that makes sense to me regarding Jaxx is that they realize how important the UI is in the context of wide-spread adoption, and seek to capitalize on those efforts. I cannot really hold that against them. If they can beat their competition to the punch, then they deserve what people are willing to pay them.
Now, it may have something to do with your 2nd point also, but it seems unlikely since the rest of their code is open source. But the bottom line is whether you are self-conscious about the build or simply want to make sure you get paid, the product has to *work*. If the code *works*, then what does it matter if there exists a 'better' way to do it?  
@_date: 2019-03-17 11:44:13

I don't suggest anyone vote for any candidate over a single platform issue, but people maligning candidates for suggesting changes like the green new deal and UBI as being unrealistic are a massive part of the problem. You are preventing the type of progressive steps necessary for the continued existence of our fucking species.
Like those denying the impacts humans have on climate, refusing to address the impact the automation of jobs has on a country is wreckless. You can't just tell these people to "learn to code" and expect they are going to strike some vein of motivation deep in their souls that permits them to reinvent their career at minimum wage.
The US education system is *fucked*, so how are you going to educate the masses for the jobs of the present, ket alone the jobs of the future. Simply refusing the change is *not* an option. 
The system is fucking broken and needs to change, and these ideas aren't being promoted just because people want free handouts. But if you actually listen to Yang talk about trying a "trickle up" approach to fueling the economy, it doesn't sound crazy and wreckless, it sounds reasonable.

Again, personally I don't recommend *anyone* utilize *any* software wallets to secure their bitcoin *holdings*. Phone wallets are inherently going to sacrifice security for convenience. It is the same reason banks will not enable NFC and chip cards without $100 limits. The convenience is great and all, but nobody needs a convenient means to instantly send thousands of dollars in value.
Anyways, with all that being said, which wallet do you suggest as an alternative to Mycelium and Jaxx? 
@_date: 2017-08-12 12:38:44
You're defeating the purpose of owning a decentralized currency by having a central authority 'hold it for you'. Exchanges can get hacked and your bitcoin can be stolen.

@_date: 2017-08-29 12:34:00
I was a fan of Mycelium but switched to Jaxx purely because I could use the one wallet for BTC and ETH, and apparently BCH will soon be supported also.
But now that I have received my Ledger, I will likely be using Jaxx even less now.
@_date: 2017-08-29 16:35:02
Again, not saying it isn't true...but I like to base things on sources, not just on comments made by a stranger on reddit.
According to [this]( a vulnerability was reported back in June that wallet backup phrases could be pulled from machines without Jaxx even running at the time. Jaxx CTO responded by saying that the nature of the 'vulnerability' was one that they had no intention of 'fixing' as it would impact the ease of use they desire in a hot wallet. So, basically Jaxx's position on the matter is that nobody should handle your PC or Phone if you are storing a fortune of bitcoin on it. Jaxx is a hot wallet meant for users actively making transactions with small amounts of a wide variety of cryptos.
Like I just said in the previous reply, even the Jaxx CTO recommends securing a Jaxx wallet with Trezor or Ledger or their own forthcoming hardware wallet.  Furthermore the article states that this "report" is an anecdotal one, and at least at the time of the update, no vulnerability in the software had actually be reported to Jaxx.

Mortgage still being paid off, portions still being set aside for my RRSPS, but our vacation fund is at 0 as that is where my Bitcoin finance has been coming from.

No. Only 16 million currently exist, and only 21 million will ever exist. That is why people who have bought into this 'early' stand to make so much. They simply have to hodl until billions of people around the world have adopted  the currency, like Facebook or cell phones. If you have 21 BTC, you hold 1 one-millionth of the entire BTC economy. Holding that percentage of an economy composed of what will be billions of people, is a very secure position.

Reconsider buying a house? Not sure where you live, but many real estate markets are inflated bubbles unlikely to provide you gains in value even remotely comparable to that of Bitcoin. 
I mean, to each there own, not sure if this was simply your strategy all along, just to double or triple your money to grow a down-payment. But hypothetically, it may be a better investment to hodl your BTC and simply rent for the short term (year or two). 
Edit: Yeah, after doing some quick math myself, I *could* pay off the remaining 180K on my mortgage, and then I'd own a house that will never be worth more than 300-350K in my lifetime. Or I could hold my bitcoin for a few more years and see where it goes, 10K in 2018, 50K in 2019? Those aren't any more unrealistic than currently holding a $4000 bitcoin was but a year ago.

Yeah, I don't really agree that this is simply 'economics at work', for every crypto seeks to represent a new economic model. Blockchain is paradigm shifting, thus the reason for FUD.
But ultimately I do agree that the market will determine which of BTC, BCH, and all the rest, is best adapted to survive the long term. I pledge no loyalty to one particular chain, but will admit I would like to see Bitcoin, not BCH, resolve the scaling issue in a way that doesn't simply seek to centralize the mining resources.
Basically, the last thing I want to see happen is a centralized blockchain dominate a decentralized one. Centralization via governments and big banks is exactly what has *failed* time after time in the current economic model.

To be perfectly blunt, you aren't one of those "smart ones", the "elected officials" we need contemplating all the intricacies of the underlying protocols to be put in place and more accurately reflect the needs of society. You are one of the average "voters" that simply needs to be provided a buffet of "choices" your simple-mind can digest and verbalize a yes/no response to.


There is substantially more to it than that. Corporations and the media, the banks on Wall Street, the military-industrial complex. There are *entities* that influence our political state much more effectively than the population at large.

This is what fucking annoys me so much. Generations of people dying in the lap of luxury while bitching about people coming from war torn regions we aided in topling.

Your concern stems from this desire to maintain *human* control, to keep a hand on the lever, and to curtail the voting power of every individual by maintaining that the majority of issues remain out of their say. This is why so many are growing ambivalent and restless with politics because it has palpably become a fucking farce.
People don't have enough of a voice and that is a massive problem. So much in the same way that Bitcoin can bring financial freedom to billions of unbanked people in the world, blockchain can bring electoral freedoms to all the marginalized and gerrymandered mess that your precious "elected officials" have given us.
Let this much be said, the reluctance to bring about sweeping changes is a hurdle we *have* to overcome. We literally have 12 years according to climate scientists, and we have such a spotty understanding of the multitude of issues and which ones should take priority.

This. Can't stress enough the importance to do your homework and not rush into this investment or cut corners.
Everyday there is someone on here complaining about how their wallet or exchange was hacked and all their bitcoin stolen.
I personally would promote Ledger over Trezor as far as hardware wallets go. There is something of a trade off here. Some prefer Trezor because they are open sourced, while others prefer Ledger because they know nothing of coding anyways and are more comfortable with the secure chips utilized by Ledger.
With that being said, only invest amounts you are able to lose. And if that is only a few hundred at the moment, then it is worth considering learning how to generate a paper wallet. Hardware wallets aren't cheap, while paper wallets require only an investment of time. Additionally, going through the steps of learning how to generate a cold storage address (one that has not transmitted private keys on the network) is an invaluable lesson in my opinion.
Lastly, how you will go about purchasing your Bitcoin will depend on where you live and what exchanges/funding options are available to you.

Greedy late-comers that pine for the day they could purchase BTC below $1000 USD. Now they figure they're just going to dump all their money into BCH and make a killing when it replaces BTC. Problem is I don't see that happening anytime in the near future. Furthermore, all these people arriving late to the party wanting to pass the torch from BTC to BCH don't give a shit about the long term. They don't know which crypto is actually better, they simply know which is more profitable to mine on any given day. Now BCH may make segwit2x obsolete, but only time will tell. Until then try to steer clear of the FUD, if you held your BTC prior to the hard fork, maybe just consider holding both for the time being as there have been many stories of people shifting all their coin to one specific chain only to see it plummet.

No, I'm not engaging in conversation with a moron who claims democracy is *tyranny*. You don't know what you are talking about.
I was refering to the fact that candidates like Tulsi are either ignored or ridiculed as being an Assad sympathyzer, rather than actually hearing her out on the issue of regime change wars. You can claim that is a contradiction, but again, you think democracy is synonymous with tyranny, so what do I care what you think?

Centralized or not, it meets the criteria of cryptocurrency. It might not meet Andreas' criteria of being open, public, borderless, neutral, and censorship resistant, but that doesn't mean it isn't a cryptocurrency.
These are just some basic definitions, they do not determine whether or not a particular network is of value and should be supported.
@_date: 2019-08-22 19:19:48
It isn't sound reasoning, period.
They think that by acknowledging that it meets the criteria of cryptocurrency, that this simultaneously acknowledges it as sharing the same *values* with Bitcoin, or more generally Andreas' criteria for an *Open* Blockchain.
They are the same people that claim BCash is an "illegitimate scam-coin" because they have a bunch of residual hate from the contentious hard fork. Whether or not you care for it, and regardless of how you feel about Ver, Wu, Wright, et al, BCash is legit. It and Bitcoin share the same history right up until they diverged on the issue of blocksize.

Again, you're the idiot if you think he doesn't understand the tech. He does, and stands to lose lots of money in the fintech industry he is already heavily invested in. Furthermore, he likely has obligations to those financial investments to not speak openly and honestly about the threat that is blockchain
This is what they *all* do. They continue playing the role of critic because they don't mind being "wrong" on this issue publicly. They will be "right" privately as they have been squirrelling their money along with everyone else.
He is a hypocrite, *not* an idiot, there is an important difference here you need to be well aware of.


Really? You sure about that? [Here he is talking about the pending recession in 2020]( about how the trade wars and intellectual property, development of 5G network, how it is all going to play out, he is right on the ball. Open your fucking eyes. Increased global Balkanization, Brexit, China and US in a stalemate, automation and AI. This guy *knows* exactly where we are heading.

Granted, no one *knows*. But what typically happens to the price of commodities like gold in a recession?
Bitcoin is not the same type of *tangible* commodity like gold and silver are, and we don't know how that will play out in the mind of investors, but I am optimistic that investments in Bitcoin and a diversity of other networks will outperform just about any basket of stocks.
This recession will be quite pivotal I suspect. We are now at a time where it is abundantly evident that centralized systems are failing socieites. Abuses of censorship and privacy, tech giants like Google, Apple, Facebook, et al, have to address the growing suspicion, and demands they are held accountable.
By and large, the biggest and best developments in the blockchain space are striving to increase personal freedoms and protections and address the problems in finance and politics that arise due to human error or corruption.

Here's a thought. Consider keeping your excitement to yourself. It is one thing to talk generally about bitcoin and crypto, but don't reveal how much you possess, and be careful not to bring it up so much that someone bursts out "what is with you and bitcoin" when you mention it.
Money is a sensitive topic for people. Many people don't understand investments and are reluctant to discuss it because they don't want to appear stupid. Other people are simply more reserved in that they don't want to hear criticism of the choices they are making. Much like talking politics at work can get you into trouble, so can talking finances.
When you talk about investing in cryotocurrencies and these things are over someone's head, they are going to try to rationalize why you are wrong, and they were right to say, invest in Gold, or worse, in stocks. It is going to be compounded if in your defense, you say things that *appear* critical of traditional investment models. Such as harboring resentment that they laughed at you, and therefore you have already resolved to "get the last laugh".
So yeah, keep that shit to yourself and don't sweat it if people don't share your opinions about it. More important than getting others interested is educating *yourself* on the topic.

Currently at 25.8, expected to go to 53 following the next halving. Gold is currently at 58 but not expected to increase significantly in the same time.

Morons jumping into daytrading overnight, people earning more money than the knowledge or responsibility in how to deal with it. There have been a lot of stories on reddit of how people became targets *specifically* because they mentioned to the wrong person how big their bags were.

It also has nothing to do with "saltiness" or envy as you imply.
Advertising wealth *in this way* makes you a target. The only people that would sacrifice their own safety, security, and piece of mind in order to drive such a pathetic *statement* clearly prioritize their own vanity over said security.
So I couldn't care less about what you think of such a statement, because quite frankly, it is really just a statement of *fact*. People cannot target you for your wealth if you do not obnoxiously display said wealth.

It is apparent as all hell that you literally have multiple people - who have successfully gained wealth thanks to Bitcoin - giving you prudent advice not to advertise your wealth like an egotistical dick.
Problem is, you've already done that.
I get it, you only wanted to recieve a bunch of "congrats man" and "sweet ride" from a bunch of strangers. You certainly aren't looking for measured comments telling you how it looks bad, and puts you at risk.

And no, being an economic hypocrite doesn't suggest "a grand conspiracy", fuck you're immature. The point is, whether or not he privately likes or invests in crypto is irrelevant, he *understands* economics, he *understands* blockchain and cryptocurrency, and more importantly he *understands* how it is going to impact the market and will continue criticizing it as long as it is profitable for him.
I would argue he *clearly* understands it all better than you do, which is why you are so *threatened* by his opinions on fucking Bitcoin. You don't know enough about crypto yourself to recognize his criticisms are without substance or merit. As a result, you resort to petulant ad homenim attacks in an effort to demean his intellegence. You call him an idiot, from a place of complete ignorance, not recognizing that he has spent more time studying emerging markets than you have spent *not* pissing in your trousers.
So shut the fuck up and just listen to the stuff he says, regardless of whether or not you *disagree* with him.
@_date: 2019-08-22 20:03:10
All the assessment in the world will not provide any certainty, but bitcoin has been seeing similar movements to commodities like gold which typically do well through economic downturns.
The riskiest investments IMHO would be stocks, simply because they seem to have the greatest uncertainty. Some will actually do well, but many will suffer and many more will outright fail under the stress. There are many more factors or variables to account for in stocks.
But as always, diversification is key to staying safe through such turbulent times, and it would be quite pragmatic to consider a little bit of everything. Percentages in gold and other precious metals as you suggest. Equities and bonds, US and foreign.
The people that get ruined in times like this are the ones that get greedy and do foolish things. Obviously putting all your money in the "right" basket can make you a killing. But the odds aren't in your favor, and if you are risking everything that is considerably dangerous.
So yeah, don't go "all in" on Bitcoin or crypto and don't abandon all traditional vehicles, they might still be needed ;)

Why do you keep saying email? You understand bitcoin doesn't operate through email, no?
This is why I am advising against this idea, you clearly don't know what you're doing. Thus you're a potential victim waiting to be taken advantage of.
Hypothetically if you clicked onto a paper wallet generator posted in this thread, you clearly don't know how to confirm if the site is legitimate or a fake site made to log your paper wallet address and keys as you create them.
How would that go bad? Well you generate a paper wallet and load some BTC on it, and give it to your friend. Your friend can even load more BTC to the public address of said wallet. Meanwhile your address and key are compromised and some random person out there in the world has access to simply swipe everything on that paper wallet to another address of his own.
It would be unfortunate enough if you're funds were stolen before they were given away, but what about if your friend didn't realize for a while, like *after* BTC goes to $100,000, and here he thinks he has a small fortune saved on a piece of paper in his safe deposit box or something.

No I didn't, it is there in the edit in the middle of my post. I glossed over it in my TL;DR because it is hardly relevant. Self-insure or third-party, if they aren't required to indicate and verify said insurance it could all be bullshit.


Same can be said of third-party, there is little difference if there is no regulation requiring an audit of the practices of the exchange to be in compliance regarding insurance. But according to the *legal wording they are providing on their website*, they insure 100% of the online funds, which actually only represent 2% of total funds since 98% are in cold storage (offline).


Well, it *does* say:




That seems clear to me.


No, I would not conclude that. They say *your Coinbase USD wallet*, not *all Coinbase USD wallets*.
At the end of the day though, yes, you are trusting the exchange on these statements. However, the fact that they made them makes them liable in court if shit were to hit the fan and claims need to be processed. If they don't have the insurance they have stated, they *should* still be held responsible in a court of law.

Not precisely.
Even if you are KYCd at your exchange, if someone holds you up and gets access to your wallet, they can send the money to an unidentified address and then conceal and tumble the movements.
After all, the only way to tie identities to the funds is at the on ramps/off ramps. The scenario you describe requiring a globally maintained blacklist that is going to be enforced by all countries is unlikely.
They can enforce it in the banking system, but you cannot eliminate the black market and enforce it directly on the network. If people exist who will accept and launder bitcoin, there are going to be holes in any attempt to "blanket KYC" the network.

Sure, but Gerald Cotten shouldn't have been the *only* person with access to the cold storage. With regulation will also come requirements to audit the practices of the exchanges to make sure they comply with some basic security requirements, such as mandatory multisig cold storage
I'm not suggesting Coinbase is more responsible, they *should* be, but who really knows? The only point is that a properly secured cold storage is not at risk the way the hot wallets are, thus why Coinbase doesn't insure 98% of their funds.
@_date: 2019-02-21 16:08:24
In order to function as a *wallet*, yes, there should be a way of sending/receiving transactions. But in order to function as "*secure storage for your private keys*", it doesn't need to function as a wallet and complete transactions at all.

Again, it isn't *just* the UI but their companies commitment to delivering the required compatibility I was looking for, well before Trezor did.
So maybe that plays into my bias too, I like that Ledger has been more responsive to the networks I see as valuable.
But I don't think either are a bad choice, one may simply be better than the other depending on what it is you're looking for. Trezor is like Linux where Ledger is like Microsoft, to draw an analogy. Neither are Apple because fuck those guys.
That being said, the whole industry is still new and evolving. With cell phone makers like Samsung finally utilizing the secure chip technology they've possessed for years now, I would argue it is *extremely likely* that dedicated hardware wallets will soon be made obsolete as Bitcoin adoption moves into the mainstream.

That was a load...like I said, glad I didn't hold my breath.
So much of that nonsense was tangential to your *assumption* that by pointing out how identities are illusory, I was suggesting they are therefore *valueless*. My point is simply that they are not immutable, and neither should *any* culture. Blind orthodoxy and adherence to *customs* is not a healthy practice, people *are* meant to understand the utility of their virtues and behaviors they adopt.
But I'm not going to say much more than this, because quite frankly you weren't even arguing *with my arguments*. You seem to have invented my whole position in *your head*, and argue that.
For example, where do I suggest that Native Americans must've been all peaceful and loving without violence prior to being overwhelmed by Europeans? What I said was that their culture and *values* were quite forcibly eradicated, not embraced the way *every* culture should be. The holocaust as another example, is an atrocity you cannot *support* in defense of your twisted view that Nationalism is *necessary*.
Cultures ought to be attenuated to survive harmoniously amongst one another, Nationalists resist this because they *refruse* to accept the  impermanence of their illusory identity. Tribalism mentality was of utility in the past, it serves little function today.

It's called hedging your bets.
In times approaching uncertainty and reductions in growth and production, the conservative approach is to ensure your *capital* is not entirely invested in the markets that contribute to growth and production. Thus people are wise to ensure their capital is adequately diversified for the uncertainty.
Physical commodities such as gold are common hedges against stocks and bonds, as companies (stocks) and governments (bonds) respective futures become more uncertain than phsyical assets that will retain their value despite a particular company or industry or government folding over during the economic downturn.
Bitcoin is still very new to people, however it is clearly and distinctly being recognized as a *commodity*, because it is not tied to any corporations or governments, it is decentralized and verified through energy expenditure (a physical commodity, electricity).
This all said, any of the very large investment firms who have substantial capital to move about on a daily basis do not *want* the value of bitcoin to escalate quickly, they want to quietly try to move their capital into bitcoin while trying to keep the price low for continued transfer in the future.

Oh boy, you've got some reading to do.
First, which country do you live in?
Second, remain skeptical of the people giving you advice on here, even me. If you are following someone's instructions and do not know what you are doing, you are at risk of being taken advantage of.
Finally, I will break it down to as few, simple points as possible.
1) You have to learn and chose how you are going to hold/store your bitcoin (technically you are actually holding the *private keys* to a bitcoin address). Paper and hardware wallets are "cold storage" where a wallet app on your phone, is "hot storage". Learn the difference between them and why you are substantially more secure if your private key has never been transmitted (cold key).
2) You need to find a means of exchange where you can trade fiat for BTC. This might be someone you meet in a coffee shop and exchange cash for BTC directly (again, you need to do your homework so you don't get taken advantage of). But more likely you will end up registering with an online exchange such as Coinbase or Kraken where you can deposit funds from your bank account and then...
3) WITHDRAW your BTC from the exchange ASAP! As said in point 1) you are controlling the *private keys* to the address where your BTC is "stored". Exchanges are *not* to be used like bank accounts. If you buy BTC on an exchange and leave it in *their* wallet, *they* control the keys. They could get hacked, and your BTC stolen, or maybe the exchange goes insolvent and begins pocketing any funds people left in their *trust*.
Edit: 4) Always double or triple check the addresses before ever hitting send on any transactions. If, for example, you're sending bitcoin from your exchange wallet to your personal hardware wallet, if you make 1 mistake when entering the *receiving* address on the exchange, your funds will likely be lost.
Good luck!

[How is Coinbase insured?](




For more on securing your account, see [here](


So, that isn't exactly clear because they claim all "digital currency held *online* is insured. However the last paragraph seems to suggest that *cryptocurrencies* - which are not recognized as legal tender - are not covered by FDIC. So, *if* the digital currencies held *online* are covered, it is by some 3rd party, not by FDIC.
**Edit** [More info under Legal](


Further down...














**TL;DR** Online digital funds are covered by third party, not by FDIC, and that only accounts for 2% of funds since 98% are held offline, and not covered at all (since cold storage should be secure from hackers, require multisig of Coinbase authorities, etc).
US Dollar accounts are covered up to $250,000 by FDIC.
That is all.

Not so, it is a statement of fact, and if in turn one reaches the conclusion that identities are of less value than one currently places on them, well, so be it. There is no point reinforcing a belief that is incorrect and serves no benefit. Claiming that America is a "Christian Nation" serves no benefits, even to Christians. For if we simply concede to let a majority of people believe in things that are simply untrue, nobody benefits from that adherence. So while Trump et al try to proselytize *lies and falsehoods* about immigrants and climate change and health care and marijuana and any number of other things, this doesn't reinforce a group identity, it reinforces delusion and regressive attitudes and practices. Religiously inclined morons that want to simultaneously cut women's access to birth control *and* abortions. These are the 'cultural practices' that *deserve* to be scrapped because there is no value in their practice.
Now if *you* want to continue being a white slave to a corrupt corpocracy that affords you only the most basic comforts and luxuries as to quell an uprising, then so be it. But I for one am not going to be a part of that mass delusion. Fucking over other 'groups' you view as being *in competition with me*. This is far too short-sighted and has resulted in an inevitable collapse, time and time again.


Which is irrelevant if it is based on a lie. Thinking you are 'part of a group' that places a particular religion or racial profile ahead of the fact that we are *all fucking humans*, is not beneficial. It served ancestors in forging the US versus THEM mentality, so lines could clearly be discriminated and drawn when needed due to competition over limited resources. Knowing what we now know, if you are still reinforcing these so-called 'values', you are morally bankrupt.


Give me an example of where Nationalists are promoting *progressive* changes.


Yes, it very much is. It is the divisive belief that a particular 'group' of people are more *deserving* than another group. Nobody is saying white Christians cannot have their group identity, or Muslims theirs, or Atheists their own. But if your group identity reinforces beliefs and practices that conflict with others, then you have a problem that needs to be resolved. If your 'white country' wages war on the other side of the planet and destabilizes a region to suit their own greeds and appetites, they have a responsibility to respond to the resulting need for immigrants. 


And thus the *exact* mentality that is a lie and of no benefit to anyone. The me-first mentality is horseshit and should be called out as such. This is the tired old orthodoxy that needs to be discarded by every developed nation. Your group mentality is ill-suited to survive against the more progressive mentalities that look beyond superficial practices and beliefs and instead root their 'identities' in those of value. Diminished belief in orthodoxy and dogma, increased valuation of science and morally realistic values that can be applied to all humans.


Really, no context in the current state of things?!? I'm sorry, but you're not speaking to reason. Cooperation and acceptance of people, recognizing that anyone and everyone can serve a common goal or good is increasingly relevant today.


Bullshit. 


Which White homelands do you speak of? America? Again, I'm not just going to concede that the States *belong* to any particular race or creed or cultural group, such an argument is indefensible and quite simply *wrong*.


Again, this is simply incoherent nonsense. Which 'White Nation' are you even referring to? Because I'm guessing it ain't fucking Russia.

Precisely, the same as any traditional investment. Market cap is stock price x number of shares.


Yes, but what is your *point* here? The market price of BCH was determined by considering these factors. Limited liquidity in its release, etc., and how much of the previously existing hashpower that had been exclusive to BTC was now diverting to BCH. If I recall correctly, when it forked it was valued around $500 USD, simultaneously dropping the value of BTC by the same amount.


Well as far as fantasies go, that sounds great, but that has nothing to do with the BTC market cap prior to being handed this 130 billion. As I start putting my money into the market it is going to increase the market price, in turn causing me to invest increasingly larger amounts for the same amount of coins.


Again, a skewed analogy, but as best as we can estimate it should be in the ballpark of 260 billion. Once I've plugged that 130 billion into the market, it doesn't matter where I made gains or losses compared to the market price on specific purchases.


Again, I get that you are apparently dancing around your point, but I fail to see it. Why not simply *explain* what about my previous statements is incorrect.
But no, if by some stroke of magic all the bitcoin in the world suddenly appeared in my wallet I would not likely be able to find someone to buy it for 130 billion. In fact, if I held all the coin it would more than likely lose that value since I now control it all. It ceases to be a valued currency and I am beginning to look something like Venezuela.

This is precisely the issue I can't seem to wrap my head around. Who is so interested in buying coffees with bitcoin that they would try to force adoption in this means? Obviously that's an oversimplification of the issue, but one thing is certain - it isn't the HODLers that care about occassional backlogs in the mempool. 
But trying to *force* scaling just seems so untenable, scaling ought to be left to good old supply/demand. Ari Paul touched on a similar point in a recent Epicenter interview. He speaks of many developments in the early days of the internet that didn't find adoption because they were simply too early to meet the looming demand to come.
Something of a catch-22, I know, but if there are too few countries that have embraced bitcoin, in turn you have too few merchants that have embraced bitcoin. No merchants to embrace bitcoin, well then it doesn't really matter how many people out there are dying to use a crypto to buy their morning coffees, the banks aren't going to be *more* receptive to Bitcoin Cash - that is unless the entire network could be sold and thus 100% centralized and such...so pretty much come full circle back to where every bank is currently looking to employ blockchain technology, distributed but *not* decentralized.
In the end, I guess I'm just another HODLer, and therefore just a fence-sitter. I still have all my BCH from the August hard fork, and likely would have bought more too if it had dropped a little lower. But since August I have put more into BTC and made gains I would not or could not have made by investing in BCH...until recently.
On that note, I understand people being passionate about one over the other and immediately selling off BCH out of principle or disgust or whatever, but this is precisely the reason why I held onto both, because I knew I couldn't predict the future and what would happen with 2x and the like, and I'm more interested in riding my investment to fortune in the *long term* not the immediate now. I can't help but think a lot of the animosity on both sides is coming from the individual's who only stand to profit from one chain, thus the hatred directed at the other side.

If stored *properly* - in cold storage to which *you* control the keys - it is 100% safe from hackers. The greater risk here is that *you* forget how to gain access, *not* that hackers will somehow gain access to it.
If stored in a hot wallet or on an exchange, yeah, it is hackable. It is convenient and suitable for amounts you'd carry in cash in your wallet. But if you are only ever carrying a couple hundred dollars worth of crypto in a hot wallet, then that isn't much of an incentive for anyone to *hack*. More likely someone just uses a $5 wrench to steal your crypto.

Ultimately the trade off is this. Trezor is open source where Ledger is not entirely open source. Ledger has a better UI and is compatible with more networks, where Trezor lags behind in this regard, but makes up for it in flexibility. Trezor is ultimately more programmable and can create a greater versatility of concealed wallets, where the Ledger Nano S (easily the most popular hardware wallet) is a little more broad in this respect.
Ultimately, Ledger is my *preferred* wallet because it delivers required security before Trezor does, time and time again. Whether that is splitting BCash or delegating my Tezos, Ledger was quicker to the draw to meet *my* standard of security.

You know, the ones that readily accuse everyone they disagree with of being an idiot and knowing nothing of Bitcoin or economics while promoting John McAfee as a "mathematician" and his prediction of a 5 million dollar bitcoin by 2020 as "plausible"?


Of people on the planet...agreed. Not *in* r/Bitcoin where saying "most people don't know about the 21 mil cap" just screams ignorance and immaturity.


Again, agreed, so shouldn't "most" of *those* people be well aware of the 21 mil cap and halving events? Of the *basics* of Bitcoin? At the very least if they are going to *pretend* to be knowledgable?
When Trump says shit like "not many people know Lincoln was a Republican", do you think *he* meant of all people in the world? Or of *Americans*. You know, the ones who *ought* to know about the political party and history of one of their greatest presidents?

Haha, are you new to reddit? Karma on posts are not exactly correlated with accuracy. And when you are engaging dumbass trolls for schadenfreude, I quite frankly don't give a shit if I sound like an asshole and receive downvotes because of offence.


Yes, karma has absolutely nothing to do with *being right*. Perhaps you should refrain from lazy habits of assuming if a particular post is guilded or buried that it reflects the accuracy of that post appropriately.
As with much of the rest of the internet, those who actually *read the content* of discussions rather than looking for cheap and quick "assessments" tend to fair better in the long run.


What nonsense? Again, the post you were responding to was *mine*, in response to someone else claiming that "most people" don't realize or know about bitcoin cap/rewards...while *in* r/Bitcoin.
To go back to my analogy of Trump commenting on Lincoln, it's like saying "most people don't know Lincoln was a Republican" amongst r/Lincoln_Enthusiasts.

Doesn't it pain you to construct pathetic and obvious strawmen? Do I need to repeat for the umpteenth time what fucking subreddit your strolled into? I'm not arguing that "most people" frequent r/Bitcoin. I'm arguing that most people *who* frequent r/bitcoin understand the basic functions of supply cap and halving of mining rewards.


Again, by your own logic...most people haven't even heard of bitcoin. Assuming that is the context, wouldn't it be redundant to say most people do not understand the facets of the technology if they don't even know about said technology?


Because of the glaring similarity to the way he discusses subjects he is *ignorant of*. "Most people didn't know health care would be so difficult" means, he as only just had the complexities *explained to him*, and is trying to *normalize* his own ignorance after the fact.
So again - if you insist on continuing to defend a troll you claim to not know or care about - go take a look at their pathetic post history of calling anyone and everyone who disagrees with them stupid and ignorant of bitcoin specifically, and economics and every other discipline they feel is relevant. 
Their simplistic "understanding" they have simply *stolen* from disreputable figures in the space and are representing as their own novel insights is absolutely apt. U/doinwhatimdoin is busy doin' stuff alright, namely *pretending* to be knowledgable and informed about a topic they are only in the beginning stages of learning. Like Trump with most things *Presidential in nature*, he's like a fucking schoolchild telling you what his teachers told him in school today.


And your point was that someone who is *not* you referred to what "most people know about bitcoin", within a bitcoin forum, and you felt the *need* to defend him from me calling that comment transparent, ignorant, and immature, of which there is an abundance of other examples in their post history.
Right, and then you implied there is something wrong with *me* because I have "nothing better to do".
Anyways bud, by the time you've wasted getting to the end of this comment, surely the world is about to collapse. Hurry, you are needed elsewhere so please feel free to fuck off ASAP.

Don't gift bitcoin.
Seriously. I understand the sentiment, but for those uninterested in it, it feels like you are forcing something on them that interests *you*, not them....because that's what you're doing.
It is the antithesis of a "thoughtful gift". The whole point of gift giving is to think about those you care about and try to get something you think *they* would like.
Don't take it as some "opportunity" to educate or force adoption through your family members. It really is no different than trying to sell family members on a new stock you feel is likely to take off. Or trying to sell your family on *your* new keto or vegan diet. Or giving them a certificate that says you have made a donation on their behalf to "the Human Fund".
I'm not saying bitcoin *is* these things, but to those who are both ignorant and disinterested in learning about this "paradigm shifting technology that will change the world", that's how it appears to them. That is *your* interest, not theirs.
You can be forthright about your opinions of the technology and willing to educate or explain when prompted, but you don't need to proselytize your newfound crypto-religion on your family. Better yet, just take the money or crypto you were *going* to give them, and keep it in your portfolio to appreciate for them. Do the hard part for them, and then in a few years if you are really so "generous" you can still gift it to them then, once they are properly interested.

Another more likely reason it is at reduced price is because Trezor is taking pre-orders for their next model. This re-seller is likely trying to unload the 'old' Trezor model from their shelves before stocking up on new and improved.
Consider pre-ordering direct from Trezor, but ultimately do some research and determine which hardware wallet has what you want, and don't concern yourself so much on the price point.

Yes, it is the total 'current value' of all bitcoin in circulation. ~~The measure of *how much fiat has been invested into bitcoin*.~~
Edit: I should clarify, I don't actually know about that number 31 billion since yesterday, as I only read the title which says 41 billion in 6 days.
Edit 2: Corrected the part regarding how much has been invested, see exchange below. Thus, "41 billion in 6 days" does not mean that much money was invested into bitcoin in that time, but that the *value* grew by that amount.

I've been waiting since Ledger announced their beta Trustlet App on the Samsumg S6 back in 2016 for them to announce a partnership with Samsung.
Despite all the hype at the beginning of the year that the S10 would host a 'native crypto wallet', and despite the fact that Samsung tried to quiet the rumours and failed, when the S10 was released everyone soon understood why Samsung wasn't advertising it. It is shit and doesn't even accept BTC, just ETH.

I think I'm beginning to see your point. The cap does not indicate a measure of how much *has been invested*, but simply what the net amount is *worth*
So if I'm holding 1 million BTC that I bought for 10k back in 2010 or something, the market cap is really only considering how much I *would* make if I were to sell that 1 million today, not how much I spent to get it.
But if this is the case, what is the answer to the question that started this thread? When they report that the market cap has added 41 billion in 6 days, this is simply the number they determine based on the movement of money in the past six days, increasing the value of the token, and in turn growing the market cap. Thus the amount of fiat that was actually added to the market was nowhere near 41 billion. But with that being said, there has to be some correlation between the amount of movement in the market cap and the amount of fiat pouring into the market to increase the price by that amount, no?

First, no, I'm not arguing that at all, that is simply your inference. That everyone in r/Bitcoin mindlessly accepts the *fallacy* that the price will necessarily rebound, *simply because it has before*. And you're right that some people think that, but some people also think the earth is flat. The point is I haven't even expressed *my* opinions and arguments to you, but you appear to already have your straw-man built, ready to dismantle.
You're also absolutely right to claim there is no *guarantee* that history will repeat itself *this* time, but thus is the nature of speculation. To conclude necessarily that the *opposite* is true, and that the price will *not* rebound and this is the end of Bitcoin, is based on what? You're feels?
Again, to put it bluntly, what makes you think this time *is different*? We hit $1000 and fell to hundreds, but what, now you think PoW has been *demonstrated* as untenable? So this time the price is in free fall? Money exiting the market to what? Ethereum, Tezos, EOS, Cosmos, Cardano? Or exiting the crypto markets altogether? Again, into what? Roubini's beloved "fintech"?


Look genius, you're the one that brought up the "chicken/egg fallacy" and made some bastardization of competing ideas in your brain. You clearly confused your point with employing *fallacies* to support the position that the price will rebound, and the *analogy* between chicken/egg and price/hype.


Where did I equate the two exactly?


Look, it's not my duty to pull you out of your circular logic. While specific *price* cannot be predicted with much reliability from day to day, long term the price can be gauged quite reliably. That is how I *knew* with a high degree of confidence that come October/November of 2018 we would see the price drop below the value it held one year previously. Granted, these are trends, but they are as reliable as it comes.
Sure there are others that are overly optimistic, fuck, even Tom Lee was predicting a bull run driving the price up to 15k by the end of 2018 a couple weeks ago - but now we know how unlikely that is.
So as far as price predictions go, expect it to go as low as $3000 USD before the next halving, but even with that said, I personally won't be breaking a sweat until we are approaching 1k, but I find that extremely unlikely to ever happen again.


Haha, alright. Thanks for the "warning" boss, feel free to find your way out...

Alright, so with all due respect, this is the same criticism that everyone and their mother makes, without even displaying a moments thought of what *backs every fiat on the planet*. Ultimately, it is a matter of faith. People have *faith* in the government as an institution, but despite that faith the American dollar has lost upwards of 90% of it's purchasing power within the last 100 years. Why is that? Is it possible that we have yet to find an accurate measure of what the value of our resources are?
Secondly, this neglects the billions of dollars that have been invested over the last 9 years into the *physical infrastructure* which backs the bitcoin network. When China floats rumors of banning bitcoin, exchanges, miners, etc., they do *not* simply flip the switch on millions of dollars worth of mining hardware and call it a day. They relocate that equipment to the next best location with cheap power, bottom line, and they get back to mining ASAP.
Now, this isn't to suggest your conclusion about the market being hype-driven isn't largely true. However with every exponential increase in value, coupled with media frenzy and eventual drop in price, you are essentially cementing in a newer, larger foundation while simultaneously determining the new floor that foundation can sustain.
[The new floor for Bitcoin is somewhere around 5k USD, while the preceding floor was approximately $500 (2015-2016).](
So my prediction for Bitcoin is that it will recover, and pending decisions by the SEC will assist in bringing that about. After all, the only ones scared off by the recent crash were either new investors that lost money, or new potential investors that *didn't*. Few people watch a plummet from $1000 to $200 and scramble to buy it up, just as few people will have the balls and foresight to scramble and buy up bitcoin at 5k. As you say, they've been scared off now that the hype has come and gone. But then there are the ones that shorted the 20k bitcoin that will be more than willing to quadruple-down on a 5k bitcoin.

Not to mention the fact that in terms of any governing body trying to distinguish between legitimate tech and true scams, Bcash does *not* clearly distinguish itself as a 'scam' while leaving Bitcoin legit. Both Bitcoin and Bcash are susceptible to influence by bad actors with enough capital to create a wake. So while assumptions being made about the motivations of actors like Roger Ver *might* be correct, if you seek to have the government recognize a forked chain of Bitcoin as a scam, how do you anticipate they are going to evaluate the parent technology from which Bcash forked?
The point is there is nothing inherent to Bcash protocol that makes it a 'scam' while Bitcoin is *not*.

[Hmm, not sure about those calculations.]( By 2040 the reward **per block** \- *not* per day - will be 0.390625 BTC. Assuming your 100x increase in BTC price, that is around $350,000 USD/BTC, or $136,718.75 USD/Block. Assuming 1 block every 10 minutes, that's $19,687,500 USD/day!!!
But, to try and ground that estimate with a more conservative view. Currently the reward is 12.5 BTC/block, or about $43,750 USD/Block assuming a current price of $3,500 USD/BTC. So, even if we were to assume a low of $100,000 USD/BTC by 2040, that is still $39,062.50 every 10 minutes. Much more comparable to today's rewards *through a bear market*.


























































































Now, if we assume you are [*generally correct about the price of electricity*]( then the average *real* price in USD between 1960 and 2011 was about 8.7 cents per KWh (or $87,000,000 USD/TWh). And if we assume this [readily cited value of about 22 terawatt-hours (TWh) per year]( to maintain the bitcoin network globally, then that is roughly 1.9 Billion USD a year. For convenience, let's sub in that very optimistic estimate of 19.6 million/day in BTC rewards by 2040, well then that 1.9 billion is paid for in rewards within 100 days, leaving 265 days of profit ;)

You said elsewhere that you got into bitcoin just before the Winklevosses ETF failed to be approved by the SEC? Yeah, that isn't *before* the media hype. It was *that very news* of a potential BTC ETF that brought a lot of jackasses out of the woodwork. How certain can you be that you are not one of them?
How well do you understand the technology? Did you spend the last year investing free time into learning how this all works? Or did you simply throw money into the space and pleasure yourself everytime the price went up 10%?
Look at it this way. The hype is integrated with the bitcoin bubbles, of which December's ATH was the largest so far. Granted we've not seen hype to this degree, I only just started to see video ads for wallets and ICO'S on Youtube late last year. But there was media hype prior to this. You didn't "get in before the hype", you got in before the most recent bubble. So you really should be more patient and invest more time and effort into truly understanding the space before telling others how to follow suit.

I wouldn't recommend selling your crypto in the hopes that you will be able to buy it back at an equal or lower price tag. 
Proof of Keys aside, don't rush to get your crypto off the exchange to take part in this event. You should be comfortable with what you are doing and sure you are doing everything correctly, so don't rush yourself. Test with a few Satoshi's to be sure you've entered the address correctly and then repeat with the remaining balance.
With all that being said though, unless you are an active trader there is no reason to leave crypto on an exchange besides laziness/ignorance. So take the time to learn how to safely complete transactions and how to secure your assets, preferably offline in "cold storage". It isn't an easy task, but it is *absolutely necessary*. For those that become comfortable with moving and securing their crypto, they will be better suited to capitalize on their gains when the time comes to sell, and they will be more confident in their decisions and actions. Like everything, practice makes perfect.
On a side, how long have you left your crypto on the exchange? Is it Bitcoin? Has it been there through all the forks and if so, did the exchange provide you with the forked coins?

No, this is sincerely incorrect. If you are a bitcoin miner and have invested in mining equipment, you're going to want to source the cheapest energy available to maximize profits. You don't yield greater *security* by spending more on power.
Here in Canada, the province of Quebec was overwhelmed with interest from mining companies in their cheap power back in late 2017/early 2018. It wasn't long before Quebec Hydro had essentially quited the hype, because they recognized the lucrative new industry, and want to capitalize on it themselves with their surplus of cheap power.
We *want* and *need* cheap, renewable energy. It is needed for continued development and progress, regardless of the use and adoption of cryptocurrencies.
Countries like China are already looking to the moon (literally) as a potential industrial base. It is the ideal location for databases. Free cooling and abundant room for efficient solar fields, let alone the possibility of Helium 3 fusion. They aren't going to be burning coal to power blockchain security even in a decade or two.

This isn't news and isn't "game-changing" for crypto. Samsung has been installing secure chips in their phones all the way back to the Galaxy S3 and Ledger already has a Beta Trustlet app that works on Samsung S6/+/edge.
Samsung hasn't announced anything, and in fact they responded to early reports of a bitcoin wallet on the S10 as "rumours and speculation".
Even when this is all released and operational, it isn't going to change much for crypto, it is a rather minor convenience. It is more secure than simply using a wallet app on a phone that doesn't utilize a secure chip, but doesn't solve the problem of carrying around a fortune in your pocket.

I think you may be misreading/misunderstanding my point. VHS didn't get "beat out" by digital discs, those technologies were more than a decade apart and never in direct competition, one preceeded the other and eventually they both became obsolete, but in both cases not until *after* they had attained adoption.
VHS became ubiquitous while Betamax did not. Blu-ray became ubiquitous while HDDVD did not, granted to a lesser extent because discs were made obsolete even faster than VHS due to the development of memory chips.
I fully recognize your point that another cryptocurrency *could* beat Bitcoin to the punch at locking in adoption, but what I'm saying is that there is *ample* reason why that is unlikely, and it is for the same reason we saw TCP/IP become the ubiquitous protocol of the world wide web. Bitcoin is unlike the VHS/Betamax or Blu-ray/HDDVD examples because both of those were races, between privatized companies securing patents to their products and getting them to market faster than the others in order to gain adoption. Controlling the patents on the technology was integral to obtaining adoption.
Bitcoin was released in 2009 and we didn't see Ethereum until 2015. Here we are nearly 10 years from it's release, and IMHO we haven't seen a worthy competitor. Arguably the strongest competition BTC has seen is in BCH, which was born out of the same open-source code over a very political debate about which direction the *technology* should take. But everyone who held 1 BTC at the time of the fork was afforded the same 1 BCH also on the forked network. So unless you are the type to become greedy and try to capitalize on opportunity, you already had your money hedged across the competition!
So, for these reasons and many more, I feel Bitcoin is here to stay, even if not in the same form it exists today.

Which is only marginally better than current wallet apps...you're still only going to want to store small amounts on a phone for convenience. It is *not* a solution for your entire crypto portfolio.
This is receiving far too much coverage for a phone even Samsung isn't advertising as a hardware wallet for crypto. Plus, it isn't even *new*. Samsung has been installing ARM-TEE chips since the Galaxy S3 and Ledger has had a working beta for the S6 for a couple years now.
This is the type of crypto "hype" ignorant masses rally around while everyone informed just looks on in annoyed disbelief. Great, a slightly more secure way to carry crypto for your morning coffee purchase...revolutionary.

They don't want to exhaust their resource as quickly as possible, if that is what you're implying.


The oil industry isn't going away as green energy solutions emerge and dominate. There will always exist the demand for petroleum products. It is but one utility - the production of electricity - that will shift away from oil. We will remain dependent on oil even if it is not for the production of power, and the burning of fossil fuels for power will only continue to be utilized as long as it is the most cost effective solution. This will not remain the case as green/renewable tech is developed.


You're missing the point if you think their utilization of electricity is 'useless'. The utility of this new technology hasn't even begun to be demonstrated or understood clearly.


Again, you misrepresent the computations as useless. This is what verifies and secures the network. People really need to pull their heads out of their asses with this point. You can't debate the utility of a technology that hasn't been fully realized, particularly if you don't even understand it. It'd be like arguing that all the effort, resources, money, infrastructure dumped into the development of the internet was 'wasteful' and 'useless' back in the late 80's.

If he were a genius he wouldn't have discounted the technology as 'nerd money' the first time he encountered it.
Credit due, he is a great speaker on the topic, and I rarely find myself disagreeing with him. However, Andreas is very much a champion for privacy and is very critical of the current KYC/AML/ATF policies which are utilized by the banking system globally.
It is this very fact that leads the major criticism leveled against Bitcoin - that it is "untraceable" and "anonymous", neither of which is actually correct.
So while I can empathize with his argument in principle, I just don't see how bitcoin is going to find adoption in a world where Governments cannot support it. If, on the other hand, you utilize the *lack* of privacy in the technology - the fact that every transaction is transparent and traceable to the extent that global governing bodies are working together - it eliminates the chief criticism of bitcoin from their view and instead provides an advantage over the current system.

Definitely pull some out so you can invest it in learning how to safely hold the remainder.
By this I mean, and as others have pointed out, pay off debts and set some aside for financial aid for those you care about, etc. Diversify your funds and if needed consider hiring an accountant.
My brother is in your position also. Got into it early and has since got me invested in it. He is now going through the process of cashing and taxing and figuring out where and how to invest it, figuring out where he wants to move and settle down. He doesn't have children though.
As others have mentioned and you likely already agree with - don't spoil them. Help them out if paying for a maid or nanny or tutor is going to assist them in investing their efforts into something worthy. But don't let them retire without having never learned how to work for a living. Having to work for a living is damn near a prerequisite for developing any character!

Your questions are good ones, but they are loaded. Also, you're asking about something that won't happen for over a century, so the blunt truth is that we don't know. Plenty of room to speculate, and the protocol can be changed.
Do you know about the halving of bitcoin mining rewards? As the price of bitcoin continues to increase with adoption, the *rewards* also reduce in amount of BTC paid out? 
Well, it is argued by some that at some point between now and the mining of the 21 millionth coin, the costs associated with mining will reduce also, and that the whole industry will operate on fees so insignificant, it is negligible. This is dependent however, on the price of electricity, and assumes that with the motivation to secure cheaper, *sustainable* energy, that the price *also* becomes negligible and maintained through fractional fees.
The other point already mentioned - that the vast majority of transactions will occur on the second layer, a Proof-of-Stake layer like the Lightning Network - is also relevant. There may be fees to validate on-chain, but those transactions would likely become quite rare and only for transfering large amounts of capital.

But the fact that you put your life savings on the line, *and succeeded*, does not mean it'll be true *this* time around. And it doesn't mean that decision was *wise* when you took it either.
I *believe* we will moon again - also based on an obsession I've had since first being introduced to Bitcoin - but it is based on the same underlying confidence in the technology as I had 5 years ago, and the same prudent caution that should be recommended to everyone. Don't *risk* losing more than you can afford to lose. Don't put your life savings into this. If you did so at the ATH you *ought* to be shitting your pants right now because you've put yourself in a very uncertain position which you have little control over.

Bitcoin has a network the verification of which is tied directly to the cost and availability of electricity. As volatile as it is, it is quickly becoming the best measure of value for the most readily used resource on the planet.
People really love to suggest that Bitcoin is backed by nothing while fiat is backed by infallible governments (whose economies never collapse like Venezuela's). The truth of the matter is that Bitcoin has come to be backed by billions of dollars of investment in physical infrastructure. We have seen FUD before and dealt with 90% crashes in the past, so what makes you think this time is different, that this time Bitcoin truly *will* die?
@_date: 2018-03-06 22:25:58
Yes, Bitcoin absolutely wants the support of Governments, that is if Bitcoin can even be said to 'want' anything. It does not want Governments *dictating* the way in which it should operate, that much is agreed, but clearly nationally supported legitimacy is only going to be a good thing.
It isn't unlike the current debate on net neutrality. Every nation wants the internet and every citizen wants their government to provide that, but they still want it to operate in a free market where service providers cannot *dictate* what services will cost you most.
Bitcoin does not *want* to operate entirely underground unless that is the only way to survive. But quite frankly it doesn't need to, it is already being embraced by countries like Switzerland, Germany and Japan, because these countries recognize the benefits.
@_date: 2018-03-20 13:48:37
I have to agree with others here. Personal sentiments about Bcash aside, can you actually argue a point that Bitcoin should be permitted while Bcash be deemed as fraudulent? Is there fundamental differences in the technologies/protocols which distinguish the former as legitimate and the latter a scam?
If you can't and you are basing this on nothing but your own opinion based on assumptions regarding the motivations of the actors influencing Bcash, you should have set those opinions aside.
Edit: Having just finished watching the entire hearing, I commend you on your answers to the questions asked, you did an excellent job addressing these issues as well as underlining how Bitcoin reinforces the proposed blockchain use cases. Clearly this is going to be an ongoing effort to inform the politicians while they seek to apply regulations as they see fit.

No, not "new" coins as in those just added to Coinbase as a trading pair. Specifically curious about *forked* coins that may have been generated or owed by funds you held in Bitcoin on Coinbase.
So, *if* you held Bitcoin (BTC) on Coinbase prior to the hard fork that generated Bitcoin Cash (BCH) back in August 2017, *then* you will now have a Bitcoin Cash wallet funded with a 1:1 ratio of the balance in your Bitcoin wallet. Since then there have been multiple other hardforks of the Bitcoin protocol such as Bitcoin Gold, Private, Diamond, etc.
I'm not sure if Coinbase supported any of those other *forks*, in which case you would have to do the work to figure out how to successfully *split* the balance of *your funds* generated on these forks from your Bitcoin, if it is even possible at this point. 
Coinbase already took the effort of splitting your Bitcoin into two different wallets for BTC and BCH.
Again, this is somewhat negligible at this point in time if your balance is small. 1 BTC is ~$3800, 1 BCH is ~$180, 1 BTG ~$20, 1 BTP is ~$2
Edit: Regarding wallet apps ("hot wallets" for your cell phone), I'm not sure what wallet comes most highly recommended anymore. In the past I had used Jaxx as it held multiple tokens, I believe BTC/ETH/LTC were all supported. But like all things in this space, do your research and make informed decisions. Try the wallets out without funds just to see how they work and what options they have, what kind of backups can be generated and restored.

After watching John Oliver's piece on cryptocurrencies on Sunday, I had a funny thought. He mentioned some 24-year old BTC-millionaire, as well as the CEO of EOS, and I couldn't help but cringe.
I just happen to imagine this Seinfeld-esque bit about how he is lately starting to notice all these really immature millionaires at black ties and  such. Curiosity gets the better of him and he starts asking what these types do for a living. Bitcoin, Bitcoin, Bitcoin. It becomes apparent, who'd have known so many lucky-slackers would benefit from being unemployed and in need of pot and would accidentally stumble into millions when they are introduced to Bitcoin as a means to purchase weed on the dark-interwebs! Now we have a bunch of stoner-millionaires who lucked out because they squirreled away $100 worth of Bitcoin back in 2011, but didn't dig it up again until 2017!
But seriously, I think it was in an UnChained podcast with Vitalik where he says one of his biggest changes of heart since entering the space has been his concern with the somewhat reckless redistribution of wealth. In the beginning he saw it as a good thing because it was rewarding people who were educated in the progressive landscape and such, but by 2017 it was apparent that there were a bunch of people who benefited simply out of luck and wouldn't benefit the overall community.

Look, it depends on the nature of your "store" and what "service" it seeks to offer. This is too simplistic to reduce to just PayPal - being a private company - free to exercise censorship whatever way they deem fit.
It is the same thing we see happening with other privatized platforms like Reddit/Facebook/Twitter/Youtube, making their respective determinations of what people should be free to use their service for and who should be restricted from it.
They've entered into a slippery slope of basically censoring themselves, on a case-by-case basis, based largely upon whatever popular opinion is prevailing. Thus why Twitter will opt to ban Milo Yianopolous or Alex Jones but not Donald Fucking "grab 'em by the pussy" Trump. They simply do the calculations of the costs associated with keeping those "figures" around, or banning them, and decide on which one appears to be more lucrative for the company as a whole. Donald Trump is given a pass because he is both President and a twitter-junkie utilizing Twitter's platform to ostensibly govern the country by popular opinion, because he will be more effective there then obviously sticking to the "traditional" methods of governing through the institutions put in place for this very reason.
Their is a bottom line when it comes to offering a service that is set to become as ubiquitous as any utility. Whatever ideologies Tommy Robinson espouses, it shouldn't prevent him from using the same money transmission platforms as everyone else.

You can have one without the other, if bitcoin disappears the distributed ledger technology will remain to be utilized in some fashion. Bitcoin was merely the first use-case of blockchain. The first Walkman may have been a Sony, but Sony need not *still exist* in order to have portable audio devices.
The only point he is trying to make is that if you want to hear of legitimate use cases for blockchain technology, Bitcoin is one of them, the first in fact. So essentially you can't weigh the pros and cons of embracing this technology in general, without simultaneously considering the pros and cons of embracing Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-27 19:12:01
Look man, aside from the fact that you are now engaging in semantics with bitcoin.org directly, resorting to ad hominem isn't going to make your incorrect position any stronger.
It is *transparent* because anyone can see every transaction. People debating you on this issue are not stupid, ignorant of what the word transparent means. Transparency has nothing to do with identity in the bitcoin network. Transparency simply means there are no hidden transactions, it is open for all to see.
But as for the term you are using incorrectly - anonymity - bitcoin can only be used in a truly anonymous way if you are able to avoid ever associating your identity with a particular transaction or address. I don't know where you're getting your bitcoin, but every bitcoin I have ever purchased has been through an exchange with which I had to have my identity verified. You met someone in person and paid them cash? Well that person saw your face and maybe even recognized you. Basically, the fact that someone *may* be able to use bitcoin if they are very careful to obtain a strong anonymity, doesn't mean that bitcoin *is* anonymous.
So, with all that being said, either reconsider your opinion - which is wrong and bound to be called out as such everytime you claim it moving forward - or don't. But you aren't going to convince [those that clearly understand it more than you]( that they are in fact wrong. They've done their homework and give zero fucks about engaging in semantics.

Patience. Soon enough the province will have all the necessary incentives to overhaul thousands of tapped oil and gas operations for geothermal. Where oil has been syphoned off and only hot water remains, a geothermal microgenerator is the next logical step.
People need to take all these things into consideration and take something of a longview with respect to this new technology.

I agree bitcoin is likely to continue making gains, if I didn't think so I wouldn't be investing in it myself. I merely make the same old caveat that nobody can predict the future, and investing money you *cannot afford to lose* is extemely risky.
There are a multitude of mentalities out there, some conservatively investing in cryptos as a means of diversifying their assets and others who are gambling every cent they can get their hands on, banking on an enormous return.

This is true of every nation in this world, even here in Canada. There have long existed tensions between the French inhabitants of the province of Quebec and the rest of Canada.


I for one am truly grateful and respectful of the inhabitants of Quebec, including their language and cultural identity, and would not want to see them separate from Canada because I think they are very much *part* of the collective Canadian identity. However, if they want to separate to their own nation, I think some very delicate and tedious negotiations need to be made, and certainly more than simply 50% of their province *ought* to be required to initiate such proceedings.
It isn't as easy as "if x number of people want y, shouldn't they be able to have it?" Borders within borders are but imaginary, this is what *progressives* recognize, and why globalism is gaining traction almost unconsciously around the world, and at the same time prompting the resistance of nationalism. We all share this planet, that is the *only* true border, the physical ones of *only so much land to inhabit*. We all share the same waters, and require the same nutrients, and *ought* to be all afforded equal rights, dignity, and respect. So while nobody should be *forced* to do anything they do not want to do, per se, it is a compromise we all must accept if we want to live amongst other people, in a civilized society.
Edit: Nah, the rant continues...
The problem with rhetoric of "PUT MY COUNTRY FIRST" is that it is a fundamentally untenable position to adopt when we now understand the impact we have on the rest of the world. Capitalistic greed is raping natural resources and hoarding wealth amongst a very small minority, while Socialist equalities can undermine our responsibilities as individuals to the whole. It is a difficult balance, and that is why you see such divided votes with many people pushing to the polar extremes on so many issues.
Not one of you are actually *owed* a single god damn thing in this life, nor are you entitled to whatever bounty your forefathers yielded. We have to all work together to apply moral truths to the world we live in, to figure out what is fair and what is not, and I assure you, more and more of this is appearing to be *universally* true, and not an issue of relatives. That is why it is always such a touchy issue when a country is *clearly* corrupt and *clearly* immoral, but what "right" does any other nation have to pass judgement or furthermore intervene and seek to *instruct* them how they are wrong. We have been down that road before with many religions seemingly guided by the best intentions of those that dominated and eradicate native beliefs and cultures. In the end, I believe that a global state is somewhat inevitable, but getting there will be anything but easy or peaceful.

Look. Now you're just playing a game of semantics to justify your incorrect declaration. Bitcoin is *not* anonymous and is *not* intended to be used anonymously. It is pseudoanonymous at best, and that is only if used in a very particular way in which nothing that identifies you can be associated with a bitcoin address.
Asserting that bitcoin *is* anonymous is **incorrect**. That's what dinosaurs repeat when they hear on FOX news that criminals and terrorists around the world are flocking to bitcoin because it conceals their identity. It doesn't. It simply makes it very difficult for institutions like banks and governments to identify the individuals involved.


Some effort is required to protect your privacy with Bitcoin. All Bitcoin transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network, which means anyone can see the balance and transactions of any Bitcoin address. However, the identity of the user behind an address remains unknown until information is revealed during a purchase or in other circumstances. This is one reason why Bitcoin addresses should only be used once. Always remember that it is your responsibility to adopt good practices in order to protect your privacy.

But I suspect the historic plunges in the traditional markets may have something to do with it also. These things coinciding with bitcoin bouncing off 6k.
Bottom line, nobody can suggest when you should buy in, the answer is always 'already'. It may still hit 5K, or it could be back at 10k by the end of the month. Welcome to bitcoin ;)

I don't know what was causing his problems because all he said was that the transaction "didn't go through". Again, I've *never* had a transaction fail with either Jaxx or Mycelium.
But you are wrong about their code and maintaining a means to proprietary ownership. They might not do things in a way you agree with, but I can assure you that is why they aren't 100% open source. Call them hacks all you want, you might be right, but *they* didn't lose OP's coins.

We don't need to ply the media with a bunch of nonsense adds in a vain attempt to get those not yet informed about cryptocurrencies to hand over their money.
Bitcoin has done just fine without excessive adds, because the technology is legitimately innovative and bound to be adopted based on its own merit.

Backup or shutup.
Seriously, I don't use hot wallets anymore, because like most bitcoin veterans, I've gone ahead and invested in a reliable hardware wallet (Ledger), and cold storage paper wallets with password encryption. But it seems like everyday someone comes on here claiming a particular wallet is flawed...without ever explaining the flaw.
I'm willing to bet that this is a result of human error...sorry OP, but as you admit, you are new to this and don't sound too confident you know what you are doing. This is just another unfortunate example of people letting the FOMO drive them into an investment *before* they take the much needed time and effort to *learn* about the tech.
So, FruitThief1, what *source* are you pointing to while you attempt to discredit what is, a rather reputable wallet? What wallet can you compare it to that has the same ease of use for users, while also providing *reasonable* security, as far as any wallet on a cell phone can offer?
To OP, why were you trying to send from Jaxx to Mycelium to begin with? I mean, what prompted you to believe your pre-2x coins would be better off in Mycelium as opposed to Jaxx. Again, I'm not trashing Mycelium either, just trying to understand what motivated the attempt other than shits-n-giggles, learning, etc.
What error message were you receiving when the "transaction would fail"? Was it the same message when you attempted to send to Coinbase?
Next, you restored the one and only Jaxx seed you've ever used? You didn't accidentally restore an older, empty wallet that never received any transactions? Also, you're absolutely certain this transaction has not appeared in Mycelium or Coinbase?
edit: For those learning, don't rush any of this unless you want to find yourself in this position, fearing you've lost thousands of dollars. Take the time to physically write out/copy addresses and always double or triple check before you press send. In this case, if you are certain you attempted to send the funds to address xXxXXxXXX and yYYyyYyYyY, you can always hop onto blockchain.info or elsewhere to see if the funds were indeed sent to that address.

This might very much be true, but it is also inherently an illusion. Just as an individual can provide a detailed description of 'who they are', when you actually break it down, they are nothing, no self, no identity. You are not the same person now as you were when you were an infant, you've changed considerably, hopefully for the better. You, in fact, are simply in a constant state of change, even if you do not perceive it. You are a different person after having read this sentence.


Well that is one of the most outrageous claims I've heard today, next to taxation is *immoral*. I don't think that those that dispute the *importance* of nationalism suggest it has *no value*, but rather that it has increasingly little value compared to the past. If you're concern for national purity and uncompromising conservation of specific cultures and practices is too strong, you run the risk of developing both genetic and cultural stagnation. The world is adapting around you then, and you are not evolving with it. Ants, as a member of the order [Hymenoptera]( are a rich collection of differing *species* with differing *behaviors*. But if a particular species becomes too specific and dependent upon a particular resource or environment, they become at risk of becoming extinct while within the collective order of ants there will be many more species, generalistic in their behaviors which will be more adaptive and likely to lead them to survive. 
With that being said however, this is precisely the reason why nations all throughout the world have to recognize what egregious acts *they* committed when they wiped out a rich diversity of native inhabitants when they colonized the Americas and beyond. Spain played their own role in that also. Languages and cultures and *identities* were lost, and it is unforgivable.
This doesn't mean there isn't a harmonious compromise to be found. One that permits the recognition of what cultural practices are *of value*, and are either neutral or positive in their expression. If there are practices that are barbaric, violent, costly, and outright dangerous - such as the running of the Bulls - perhaps they ought to only be remembered from this point forward, and not ritually practiced only for the sake of cultural expression. The same can be said of many practices all over the world. Basically, it is the culture and practices that are *of value to begin with*, that ought to be embraced and protected. Protecting estates to be passed onto offspring so they never have to work or contribute to a society they are going to utilize simply for their own entertainment and to feel like they 'belong', is without value. There is no value in the belief that America is a *Christian nation* or that white people are superior to all other ethnicities. Basically, there is *no value* in believing lies.


Sure, but again, the group can identify with *virtues*, and other practices and beliefs that are *of value to all humankind*. How do you defend [Russia's law decriminalizing domestic violence]( or [Trump's argument that the removal of Confederate statues is an assult on "culture"]( Some things are best left to the history books, not forgotten, but no longer valued.


But everyone really *is* interchangeable.  Not one of us is so special and unique that the world would not continue to spin without us. Even pivotal people, from Socrates to Einstein, each one could have died, and yet *humanity* still would have come to recognize the truths those particular individuals revealed to the world. And that I think drives the point home regarding the whole Nationalism/Globalism debate. If you are choosing a National identity over a Global identity, you're ultimately going to reduce your argument to smaller issues than can be made for the the collective of human culture the world over. I for one haven't seen all the rich cultures of the world, and likely never will, but I don't think it is one or the other. Either a tribally divided, collection of protectionist groups, or simply one big bland homogenous one. I think we can find a harmonious collection of distinct cultures and practices the world over while still granting every *human* the same dignities and respects we all ought to receive from one another.

Such as Mr. Brad Sherman? That was almost painful the exchange between he and Mr. Brummer. Quite frankly, no Mr. Sherman, there is no utility for which *you* need Bitcoin over USD, because you're a fucking dinosaur-congressman who has access to the banking system.  He seems to think it is only used by criminals and pajama-wearing slackers promising their wives of millionaire lifestyles. I couldn't help but conclude that there is actually some pajama-wearing slacker back in California that this guy is jealous of ;)
 
But in all seriousness, that panel shouldn't have to explain to this guy why his solution of simply sending Swiss Francs to developing nations is not an adequate alternative to providing billions around the world with access to a global economy.
Mr. Emmer clearly gets it, which is why he mentioned the initiatives in his home state to provide banking identities to those who cannot get them. And he is also right that this should be embraced by republicans and democrats alike. It provides massive efficiencies *and* social service. Fucking win-win...unless you are a bank I guess.

Um, it isn't a fallacy and neither is the chicken/egg, but that's another discussion.
Look, we've seen it for the past 2 months as we stretched through the lowest volatility of the year, and there was essentially *no hype*. It happens every. fucking. time. without fail. If the *price* starts on a trend away from this no-news zone of "stable", it initiates the "here we go to the moon" crowds and generating that type of FOMO-inspiring rhetoric. If the price begins to tank, it's "the sky is falling crowd" generating the FUD.

Hardware wallets are more secure *because* they are less mobile. If you want a wallet you can carry around in your pocket so you can *send* bitcoin whenever you want, well, what you want is simply never going to be as secure as a bitcoin in a vault (cold storage). It is with ease of use that things become insecure. You wouldn't walk around dragging a safe behind you with a combo etched into the bottom so you can open it *whenever you want*.
People need to realize, that the tech simply isn't there yet. Maybe in the next year or two some bright people will develop a piece of tech that integrates a hardware wallet directly into a cellphone. But again, this is necessarily less secure than keeping your money in a safe at home. As Andreas often says, if you are walking around with immediate access to your bitcoin fortune, anyone with a gun to your head can force that bitcoin out of your hardware wallet and into theirs. Blockchain technology hasn't changed that.
So, instead, consider how much you really need to carry with you at all times, and how much of your savings are simply that...*savings*. Keep them secret and keep them safe.

Not really, because the 'buggyness' is not really a security flaw, anymore than any wallet on your phone is somewhat insecure, because it is a hot wallet.
Just because there is lag in the refresh of a balance, or the amount is converted into USD instead of CAD isn't compromising the security of your seeds.
But with that being said, basically the points you are inquiring about is why I don't use *any* hot wallets anymore. Because as you touch on, when you use an application that has been developed by someone other than you, you are placing faith in their app. So why not educate yourself a little further, and realize that in the current game, nobody *needs* to be storing their bitcoin on their phone unless it is for shits-n-giggles. Basically, you shouldn't keep any amount of BTC that you wouldn't keep in fiat in a physical wallet. If you're comfortable walking around with a few hundred bucks that can be lost or stolen, then go right ahead. But if you've got 10k on your *phone*, ask yourself, how comfortable would you be with 10k of cash in your pocket?
@_date: 2017-10-29 17:12:26
I'm not suggesting that there is no such thing as ownership, and therefore no such thing as theft, you seem to always be only one step away from reaching a conclusion. I'm suggesting that the two are interdependent concepts, you can't have one without the other. When I say you can't actually possess anything, the point is that possessions are but the relative societal constructs you agree to when you develop an order of law. This is *not morality*.
So when you say taxation is theft because it is the act of taking something that is in your possession, I'm forcing you to define what it is you possess to begin with, lest your reasoning is merely circular.
The bottom line is that the only idiotic line of reasoning in this discussion is that taxation is *theft* and thus *immoral*. Taxation isn't theft, it is *payment* for shared services - granted it is compulsory - but you *agree* to pay your portion of by *living* in that society. You've agreed to the conditions, it's why you don't just move to another country that doesn't have taxes. You stay because you recognize the comforts your society affords you, and taxation is part of the package.

The FOMO is palpable these days. People now have a precedent to compare with in the BCH fork. They want to get coins before it reaches 10k, which they are now convinced is entirely possible by the end of 2017. But more importantly, they are salavating over the upcoming hardfork, where 'free money' can be made in the split.
Some people made a lot of money off their BCH. The 2x hardfork is going to be even crazier. Be very careful all, getting greedy can backfire, and you don't want to be the sap selling off BTC for BCH thinking you've been gifted a new, cheap price to buy in.

I didn't explain because that isn't the argument I'm making. Go back. Read again...thoroughly.
A hot wallet on a cell phone is convenient (no more convenient than NFC), I'm not disputing that point, don't know why you think I am. My point is that it is necessarily less secure than hardware wallets or cold storage, because with the ease of carrying constant access to your private keys, you are at greater risk of being compromised. Again, the same can be said with NFC, it is necessarily less secure than chip and pin combination. However with most banks, NFC will be protected if someone manages to clone your card and make unauthorized transactions. Bitcoin has nobody to cover your ass if someone hacks your phone.
Next, using bitcoin for purchases is all well and good once you've identified places that will accept it, but it isn't readily adopted yet. Furthermore, with every satoshi you use to purchase your beers and coffees, you also have to refund your bitcoin balance, lest you are losing more than that 7% when the price pumps a few hundred dollars in a matter of hours.
From there, my point to OP is simply that they are in this situation *not* because they chose Jaxx over Bread or some other wallet, but because *they* almost certainly made a mistake when backing up, entering the receiving address, or restoring the seed.
So now, feel free to carry on a debate amongst yourself about how great it is to buy your morning coffees with bitcoin from your cell phone. I however will opt to continue using what I feel is equally convenient and more readily adopted, until the bitcoin logo is on par with Visa, Mastercard, Interac, or cold hard cash.

Yeah, that's a tough one.
Now that it is shooting to the moon, again, I am starting to have people lament about not buying when I told them about it - be that at $200 or $2000 - and then ask if they should buy now.
This just makes me uncomfortable, because I don't want to be responsible for their investment. As others have pointed out, people want to buy when gains are being posted in the news. But then when it is dropping hundreds of dollars they get freaked out and don't want to invest. They bounce from the FOMO to the FUD and then back again realizing they have indeed missed another opportunity.
But yeah. A FOMO pre-fork pump isn't the wise time to buy. You'd be better off keeping an eye on it and waiting for the next dip. Sitting at $5800, I think it is more likely to drop back below $5000 in the next two weeks than spike, yet again, to $7500. But I could easily, and gladly be wrong in that.   
@_date: 2019-09-25 14:45:00
This. The stock market plunge is mostly attributable to Trump's UN speech about "resisting globalism" and supporting "patriotism". Maybe also impacted by the rumours of the official impeachment inquiry.
The plunge in BTC is mostly attributable to the [1.2bn transfered yesterday.](
**Edit:** It would seem that my explanation of how these events are not *causally* related is being interpreted as an explanation of how they are not *correlated*. I apologize for the confusion, I thought u/Dillydilly had made the point clearly enough about how they are not correlated.
They are *neither*. Quite frankly there is insufficient data to conclude correlation of these two markets within a frame of reference of a day. Compare them again across the week, a month, a year [and you will have a very hard time concluding they are correlated at all.](


**Edit 2:** provided by u/Darius510

No u/Darius510, all you have shown is a see-saw of "correlation", from -0.75, -0.5, 0.00, +0.5, +0.75 and then have decided to cherry-pick the +0.75 to confirm your bias which you committed to yesterday!

The 'pros' of Bitcoin wallet development have not yet been fleshed out, because this is all still that new. Even the Core team can see their position ousted with a hardfork that better serves the demand of the network.
So as I said before and will say again, Jaxx did *not* lose OP's money. OP lost his own money while *using* Jaxx, there is a difference. By all means, recommend he not use it and opt for Bread or Copay, but that is neither here nor there with respect to lost funds.
Lastly, you will see if you reread my comments, that I don't suggest anyone just getting into bitcoin simply install a hot wallet and start using it as currency. This hasn't been adopted yet, so right now it is a store of value with the potential of a currency once scaling and adoption permit. People shouldn't just jump into a new economy for an easier or more convenient way to buy a fucking beer. We've already got NFC for that through the banks, which are still more convenient than most Bitcoiners are willing to admit.

This is the very definition of coincidence. They are simply two similar yet *unrelated* events that happened to coincide on the same day. The fact that they occured roughly simultaneously doesn't imply correlation *or* causation. It is only *coincidence*!
Edit: I think I understand why you are confused however. You are stuck looking at that graph linked by OP and are neglecting the observation made by u/Dillydilly

*If* the contractor had been able to provide the customer a public address to which bitcoin could be sent, there would be *essentially* no way any fraudster could intercept the transaction (no delivery of insecure passwords over insecure emails from customer to contractor in order for the contractor to pull the funds).
Customer can provide verification that funds were indeed sent to the provided address on the public ledger. If the contractor neglected to keep that address and his corresponding keys secure, he is the one that is liable if a malicious player gains access to those funds after customer had transfered to the provided address.

Plus all Samsung phones since the Galaxy SIII have an ARM TEE processor.

Like others have said, you're defining the value of Bitcoin within that context, person-to-person digital cash. You have the freedom to be your own bank, certainly. But that is not the only means by which Bitcoin assums value. It assumes value by being backwards compatible with the old world financial system. This is a *good* thing. You don't *want* bitcoin to only have value with people under 40.
So quite frankly, I think you're looking at it backwards. If you think fiat is "making bitcoin it's bitch" by enabling ETF investing - aside from the cringeworthy phrasing, I see it as precisely the opposite. Bitcoin is going to *consume* everything, and eventually stand to serve as backing for all global fiat.

You didn't call anything first, [Ledger has had a working beta for years](
Thankfully, Samsung had the foresight to install secure ARM processors in their smartphones since the Galaxy S3 I believe. The intent was that banks would begin utilizing these chips for their services, but that didn't quite pan out. Instead, Ledger has done it and is developing further. But if you own a Samsung S6 phone, you can get the Ledger Trustlet installed right now, and you'll essentially be walking around with an integrated hardware wallet inside your phone.

Yes, that is the idea. A lot of laws in a society are compulsory. You don't get to simply do whatever you want. Jobs are also compulsory in society, for the most part. Not many can get by without one, whether they be legitimate or not.


First, that isn't universally true. Second, it doesn't address your issue of taxes being *inherently immoral*. By this logic we can short circuit the discussion with an equal and opposite counter-point, being that tax *evasion* is immoral - by not paying your taxes and still collecting services from the common pool, using the infrastructure taxes maintain, you are essentially stealing.


Yeah, and so you see how you're failing to justify your argument then? Basically you're saying if people were just inherently generous and fair and dedicated and hard working and empathetic to the needs of others, taxes wouldn't be *needed*. I'm sorry to say people are flawed, and require rules and order so as to not slip into chaos.

Ahh, I see, you're a software developer, thus the hate-on for the 'competition'.
Look, I'm not suggesting it isn't possible because of my anecdote of never having a problem - I'm saying I don't know what OP experienced as the error because I've never had any problems with transactions be it hardware wallet, exchange or Jaxx or Mycelium, or cold storage. When *you* use these correctly, it either works and money goes as directed or doesn't and stays put, it doesn't fucking vanish because of bad code.
You're the one suggesting Jaxx lost his coin because you think their software is shit. So again, support your claim that Jaxx has such a vulnerability that would permit OP to attempt a transfer, he do everything correctly, and Jaxx just loses the bitcoin to thin air.
Lastly, just to clarify one. more. time. I'm not saying Jaxx *isn't* shitty software, you can be correct on that - here I implore my username. My point is that neither helps him recovery his funds nor does it point to the actual reason he lost them to begin with.

That entire post is a matter of opinion, which you are certainly entitled to. So again, show where Jaxx's software has resulted in people losing coins. OP comes on asking if he's lost his coins forever, and people just point to his wallet??? It isn't *because* of Jaxx, it is something that *he did*. By all means, add what you've said above and recommend they not use it in the future if you want, but don't suggest someone who is "new to this" isn't to blame and instead it is his wallet developers.

This whole thread is an "unnecessary comment". I mean seriously, were you hoping to come off sounding like a discontented teenage girl, ignorant of the fact that the world doesn't care about "Satoshi's vision" anymore?!
Seriously, people throwing around the phrase "Satoshi's vision" is something of a tell tale sign of idealistic ignorance these days. Bitcoin Cash tries to advertise their network as following "Satoshi's vision", so is Bitcoin Private now, shills in this industry were inevitable. Orthodoxy was the old world's game, the new world is purely about adaptation and efficiency. Every avenue or "vision" will be explored, and those which meet a demand will be adopted, that which serves no purpose will eventually go extinct. Natural selection isn't confined to the realm of living things, it exercises it's influences in technology as well.
But to continue beating this particular point, employing a crutch phrase like "Satoshi's vision", demonstrates that the person still hasn't educated themselves on the technology (beyond maybe how to buy it and store it in a hot wallet on their phone). They are a slave to popular opinion and ideology and are uncomfortable being forced to think critically and take responsibility for the actions they take and the innovations they support.
We're in the 21st century now and things are being innovated faster than ever in the age of industrialization. Do you think anyone today cares what Thomas Edison's *vision* of electricity was? If we had we wouldn't have *adopted* alternating currents.
Just look at the tribalism that has formed around Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash. People waste their time arguing about which chain Satoshi would *actually* endorse without considering the possibility that he wouldn't favour either. Perhaps want Satoshi *really* wanted, and why he has remained anonymous, was for the technology to evolve organically. Now we don't just have cryptocurrencies, but a gamut of smart contract and governance protocols like Ethereum, Tezos, Cardano, etc. Where do they fit in "Satoshi's vision", should we approve or disapprove of those? All of them or just the ones without functional networks ;)
The bottom line is that a painful adoption process into the extant financial landscape is absolutely necessary for bitcoin adoption. There is far too much institutional money in the portfolios of old men that will *never* trouble themselves with a new education. They don't want to learn about what *problem* bitcoin actually solved, they are content to listen to their advisors that it is secure and can transmit value. Thus they want to invest in it the same way they've invested in everything else in their life, with someone else operating as a custodian. They have faith that the machine is not about to collapse and they have faith in ETF's, so it was absolutely inevitable that someone would seek to sell them bitcoin *without the hassle*. Granted, that doesn't appeal to me personally or the youthful majority, but the youthful majority doesn't control the majority of wealth, old people do.

They are likely correct though. Libra's chance of finding all the government approval to launch a new currency that would find immediate support from over 2 billion "customers" is unlikely.
Did you happen to watch the senate hearings? Representatives on both sides of the isle are distrustful of Facebook and the company cannot just ignore the government and release the coin anyway, like an open and transparent network like Bitcoin can find adoption despite the ongoing debate of regulations because it is truly decentralized.

No you dipshit, I'm not "hanging onto" anything. The negligble point you keep insisting is correlated would be tossed out by anyone with a legitimate understanding of statistics and interest in whether or not the markets are correlated.


How many times can you double-down on this irrelevant matter of *coincidence*, confusing it for correlation? I've seriously lost count. Clearly you aren't getting it through your skull. Maybe try pounding it against a wall?


Yes, the math speaks for itself and it says you are a pitiful mix of stubborness and ignorance.

Look, it doesn't matter what model you use if that model does not accurately assess the value of the resources it manipulates. You suggest a deflationary model leads to hoarding of capital by the elites?!? What fucking world do you live in, did you not just see the tax plan Trump et al just shoved through congress?!?
Or how about Venezuela? A country dealing with hyperinflation so badly that they had no choice but to embrace a 'petro-backed' cryptocurrency.
What people will eventually come to see is that Bitcoin ties it's value directly to the energy used to verify the network. Thus within another 5-10 years we will have one of the most accurate measures of the most readily used resource, electricity. We've seen this before with other technologies and we are seeing it now with sustainable energy, that is where the future lies regardless of which fiat system you currently latch onto you.
But by all means, I can take the down votes along with another $1000 slide in price. After all, I've made my millions and am now just playing and speculating with all that 'easy money'.
My point isn't to convince people of Bitcoin, it'll happen regardless of what I say to convince or warn people. But if you think the recent price crash is the end of Bitcoin you are just as ignorant as every person that piled their life savings into the industry at an ATH.

So firstly, I think a lot of people [confuse their beliefs, or principles, with morality]( I for one feel that there exist moral *truths*, the same way there exist physical *truths* that can be confirmed through empirical study. These moral truths are exactly that, true regardless of whether or not we *believe* in them.
Morality is *not* the set of principles an individual adopts, or the set of laws that a society adopts. These systems of 'belief' and 'rules' are *informed* by moral truths, which we have to reveal to be true in a similar way we have revealed truths in physics that inform the rules, such as the *laws of thermodynamics*.
So while society may rabble over what actions are just or unjust -
 and you presume you have 'fewer exceptions than others' - the moral truths remain out there unchanging. They have emerged alongside the emergence of life, the ability to suffer and perceive emotions that *serve a purpose to biological organisms*. So, while we evolved from single celled organisms to multi-cellular ones, and eventually to primates, the actions and behaviors adapted by the organisms were determined by whether or not those actions were beneficial for *survival*, without regard to what is actually *moral*.
Thus, actions like murder, and rape, and theft - while all being behaviors that can be quite beneficial for an organisms survival and propagation - are all *immoral*. Now, relating that back to *taxes*, it is short-sighted to simply conclude that taxes are immoral because it is simply theft of your *property*. Before you can even support that line of argument, you have to support the argument that *you can actually possess something to begin with*. And when we live in a society where we all understand the rules, that when we get a job and negotiate a salary, that we recognize taxation is one of those rules we agree to, regardless of how you actually feel about the amount to which you are being taxed.

If you are going this root, learn how to create a paper wallet (cold storage). This is one of the most secure ways to store your coins for long term, as the private keys associated with your public address have never been transmitted or stored on the internet (hot).
Learn how to use the *legit* bitaddress html to generate a new address. Then, send a fraction of a bitcoin to that address and verify the balance on Blockchain.info. Once you've confirmed your transaction indeed appeared in the cold wallet, then you can send whatever bitcoins you have your hands on that you'd like to lock away. Meanwhile, you will have to find a safe way to secure your private keys so you can access the funds in the future, either by printing multiple password encrypted copies - where the password will remain *only* in your brain - or perhaps an m of n key distributed in secure locations.
If all this stuff sounds foreign to you, you've got some homework to do - lest you may find yourself in OP's position in a few months or years, when your phone gets hacked, or you lose your recovery phase, or whatever...
Don't let the greed sweep you out to sea, learn the tech and ALL the ways it can be used and secured, and only then can *you* make a confident decision in what is a secure means of storage. Don't just use the first how-to you come across on google to secure a fortune.

That isn't true, you're just tearing apart a strawman.
As [the old saying goes]( there are only two things certain in life, death and taxes.
Arguing that taxes are *immoral* is nothing but incoherent. You were born into a civilization where taxes are a *necessity*. Look around the world, you will see quite a disparity between nations that have the highest taxes and those that have the lowest or none.
Next, your whole premise that taxation is theft is based on the predicate that anyone can actually *own* anything. Ownership is not so simple a concept unless you live in a society where you have rules and laws that *govern ownership*. The *money* that you use - not apparently to pay taxes willingly - was printed by a government that not simply *demands* taxation, but *requires it to function*. Taxes pay the law enforcement officers you call when someone forces their way into your home, and takes "your things". Without society, the only protection you have is your own two hands, and that comes with risking your life to protect *your food*, *your wife*, and *your offspring*.
Bottom line, nobody *wants* to pay taxes. But you ought to recognize that the money you feel is *yours* only to be given away to support a society, isn't truly *yours at all*. You could look at it another way, which is that you, as an individual, need and want things in this world you can't get without the knowledge and abilities afforded by living in a society. This goes back *millenia*. By living in a society and sharing the load we allow for specialization. People were able to master farming and the smelting of iron. People were able to build better and stronger weapons and tackle disease and famine. And as the population grew, so did our collective knowledge and abilities. You simply do not get to where we have without developing an *economy*. A means of measuring the value of resources and the cost of labour, and yes, what portion you are required to give back to society so that the infrastructure you take for granted doesn't collapse around you.
Lastly, who said life was *moral* to begin with. In order to survive, life must consume other life. It competes with other life for what is a limited amount of resources on a very tiny planet in a very massive universe. Life *necessitates* immoral action. Or as the Buddhists posit, life *is* suffering.
Now shut up, and pay your taxes.

I think you're misguided in thinking this scenario is even theoretically possible, as it is effectively impossible.
In order for all bitcoin to be *lost* someone would have to be *actively losing them*, meaning that they seek to funnel all the bitcoin to an address without retaining the private key for example.
This would quickly become impossible to achieve for this person is effectively throwing money away in an attempt to destroy the bitcoin network. With every bitcoin tossed away to never be recovered, all the remaining bitcoin increases in value. Eventually said person would no longer be able to afford to buy up the remaining bitcoin.

That you are *wrong* about the perceived "correlation" because you neglected to notice what u/Dillydilly did, that the scales are not comprable, that one was a -14% and the other was only -1%. Put bluntly, that graph is deliberately misleading and if you believe *that* constitutes correlation you need to go back to school.
Do you still want to argue that they are correlated? Do you have any idea how ridiculous that is? Then you want to hinge your entire argument that they were *"correlated for 24 hours"*, and even that cannot be supported by the actual *numbers*, the *math*!

Don't you see the contradiction here? You cannot argue on one hand that *morality is subjective* and on the other *you should only have to pay for the things you support*. You may live the majority of your life without colon cancer. However, if and when you go to the doctor at 60 for a checkup, I'm sure you'll appreciate then that the infrastructure you *didn't need until now* was providing for the education, training and technologies that diagnose, treat, and ultimately *save* you from colon cancer.
Ultimately that is why it is an all or nothing game. If nobody was required to put money towards things they don't *currently* need or want, then you don't get the developments you cannot see the value in *until they exist*. If it were up to the collective of Americans whether or not the US government should invest tax dollars into furthering communications technology, then you don't get the internet.
That being said, I take issue with that statement regarding *morality*


WTF? Who in their right mind is taking the side of that argument you *thrust* upon me. Morality is subjective, now try to defend the position that stealing is not immoral? *You* defend that position if you think it is all relative!
The debate surrounding moral realism and moral relativism is a long and arduous one I have no intention of entering with you. Suffice it to say all of the laws that you see generally agreed upon in *civilized* societies are all morally *real*, or absolutes. Murder is immoral, there is no *debate* to be had there. Rape is immoral, again, no debate to be had there. Slavery is immoral, go ahead and attempt a defense of these things if you want, I'm sure it'll prove entertaining.


So aside from pointing out another glairing incongruency in your logic surrounding the moral absolute that people should be free to make choices. No, a *just* government allows the people to determine how much taxes should be taken and from whom, and ultimately how they should be spent. You elect these governments into power with *your vote*, that is the limits of your choice on the matter. You also choose to participate in a form of democracy, and it has its limitations because you are but one person in a population of millions. But you *choose* to stay in the game because of all the comforts and benefits it affords, else you'd *choose* to move into the woods, away from all civilization.

Granted, it isn't a governmental ban, on the contrary, the Canadian Government recognizes digital currencies as commodities and was the first country in the world to table a bill naming virtual currencies in the text. But now they have a problem that has to be resolved. Canadians are trying to figure out how to give the government their capital gains on cryptocurrency investments while the banks are closing accounts of clients making transactions with crypto-friendly merchants.

Ultimately...it shouldn't matter.
If you buy BTC today only to spend it later today at essentially the same price, it doesn't matter what the price of BTC is today compared to Monday.
I don't know what you plan on purchasing in BTC, but in my experience, prices are set in fiat (less volatile) and the bitcoin price adjusts based on the current exchange.
For example, if you're going to buy a hardware wallet for $150 USD, and pay for it in BTC, we'll the price is $150 USD worth of BTC at the time of the purchase.
Now, if you buy your BTC today at a low, and then go about *spending* that BTC in a few days at a higher price, you are essentially saving money because whatever you plan to purchase is going to cost *more* BTC when the price of BTC is *lower*, or is going to cost *less* BTC when the price is *higher*.

I like Mycelium. This is reasonably safe, as long as you keep your wallet backup words in a safe place *and* keep your phone locked.
Ultimately, it is a question of amounts, desired convenience and acceptable risk. I wouldn't suggest walking around with a hot million USD in bitcoin on a phone in your pocket, but if you have your backup safe, transaction pin memorized, and keep your phone locked...it's reasonably secure.
That being said, if you store thousands worth of Bitcoin in your pocket and possess the knowledge to send that instantly, you could technically get mugged by a tech-wise criminal.

Yeah, currently waiting on the September ledgers myself.
You can put your coin into cold storage/paper wallet if you plan on simply hodling. Or just make sure you have your coin in a wallet that supports BIP148 and gives *you* the private key. Any worthy wallet will be ready for BIP148, but simply inquire if the wallet you plan on using, does. This is simply to ensure that if we see two lasting chains that your coin remains valid on *both* chains.
In such a case you will have BTC-Legacy and BTC-148 (I believe). Again, it is irrelevant if you're just planning to hodl. Likely one will be worthless and in the end it won't matter much, but as long as both chains exist, they will have their own value and you can buy up or sell both.

I don't use GDAX or Coinbase for that matter, but I am highly skeptical they have limits on withdrawing crypto. Withdrawal limits on fiat, sure, but you should be able to send any BTC to another wallet with confirmations within an hour, no?
@_date: 2017-07-16 13:00:25


The only way is to hold onto the cash until you have a confirmed BTC balance in your wallet.


Makes it fairly easy for him to screw you over, no? 


There are lots.


Lots of options...just curious, how have you gone about *looking*? Did you not come across Coinbase or Kraken and the like? Which country do you live in?
Most exchanges I have come across will even permit you to fund your account with fiat by bank transfer for free, but that means getting verified and waiting like 5 days for the transfer to complete the old-fashioned way. However if you are in a hurry to buy BTC, I don't think you even need to be verified on Coinbase to purchase with credit card. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 16:49:45
NEVER LEAVE YOUR BITCOIN ON THE EXCHANGE!
The only time you should leave BTC on an exchange is when you are PLANNING to exchange or withdraw it as fiat. Otherwise, ALWAYS HOLD your BTC off of the exchange in a wallet where YOU possess the private keys.
Whatever happens come August 1st, you are at least certain that your BTC is safe and entirely in YOUR POSSESSION.
@_date: 2017-07-10 21:03:58
I have no idea how the insurance for the exchanges work, but with that being said, I have no intention of ever putting it to the test because I will not leave them with the private keys to *my* bitcoin.
One only needs to look to the problems that have occurred on *other* exchanges to realize why you should NOT treat an exchange like a bank and 'secure' your coin there. The *only* secure coin is that which *you hold the keys to*. Period.
As for alt-coins, I don't know because thus far I haven't bothered with them. I would assume at the very least you can generate paper wallets for them.
@_date: 2017-07-16 13:05:20
The safest *and* cheapest way is to get verified on a bitcoin exchange. You can add fiat funds via bank transfer (for free), and then purchase bitcoin on the exchange and then send the BTC *off the exchange* and into a wallet where *you* hold the private keys.

Ok. But don't you think the people need to learn to boycott platforms like Facebook and Twitter first? It's not like society is exactly listening to your concern over privacy. They fucking hand it away, and when they find out the company they gave it to cannot be trusted, they mostly don't seem to care.

Fair or not, you didn't even address my particular concern.
My concern was not a 'lack of notice' - but rather limits on crypto withdrawals. Now if you can explain why users have BTC being 'held' by your exchange - other than simply pointing to some mass email notice you sent out to all 'customers' - then by all means, explain.
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:22:01
To respond to your edit, the only problem *is* that you don't know. You don't know what is going to happen with the price of BTC, or if we are going to see a hard fork. Basically, you do not know how Coinbase is going to respond to the uncertainty as BIP 148 unfolds. What if the BTC price tanks and Coinbase places an indefinite hold on all the BTC on the exchange?
The point is, that while exchanges *should* be secure enough to leave your BTC on it with the private keys in their possession, something unforeseen could happen that places an obstacle between you and your BTC. By keeping the BTC and Keys in your possession, you don't have to worry about what happens with a specific exchange, you only have to worry about the overall state of the BTC network.
@_date: 2019-05-22 13:17:05
What you and others are failing to understand by trying to defend OP is that you do not *own* bitcoin. **You own the private keys of the bitcoin *address*.** OP transfered *ownership* to another party when he sent it to an address to which he does not own the keys, while lacking any sort of custodial agreement *had he deposited it correctly* to his Huobi wallet address.
Everyone else in this thread is still thinking in terms of traditional currency. Like an address is a "wallet" that you "fill" with "bitcoins" that you "own". You need to do more reading. You do not understand the technology. 
Wallets do not "hold bitcoins". They hold **private keys**, this is *what* you *own* when you say "I own bitcoin". You are *actually* saying that I own the private key(s) to an address which has a balance of bitcoin.
This isn't about being an asshole to someone who made a mistske. This is is about attributing who is *responsible* for aiding OP in this event. If you think Huobi is obligated to help OP get his 1 BTC back, you're ignorant, naive, idealistic, take your pick.
There are no laws to compel Huobi to comply, and if there *were*, OP would have to exercise them before Huobi complied. They aren't going to just up and check their multisig cold wallet addresses to return 1 measly BTC back to an idiot who randomly sent it there. Huobi isn't even agreeing that the address is theirs! Why are you even assuming OP's "detective work" in claiming Huobi controls the address is valid?
@_date: 2019-05-08 17:06:02
You are so oblivious. The reason your electricity is so cheap is because it is sourced by filthy fucking oil.
Nobody *wants* the bitcoin network to be validated and mined on the backs of cheap, *dirty* electricity from oil-rich countries. They want it back by abundant, cheap, *renewable* energy.
You are being roasted because you've asked for it. You're ignorant comments like "my electricity is free" coupled with ones like "I want financial independence". What the fuck did you go to college for?

@_date: 2019-05-09 11:13:57
What reality are *you* living in?
Renewables are now more inexpensive and competitive with traditional sources of energy. Countries like Saudi Arabia and Kuwait aren't going to survive another century if they remain dependent on their oil reserves.
The bottom line of *money* is certainly the aim of the psycopathic corporations that have no regard about the longevity of the human species. Unfortunately this endgame of doing whatever will make you a buck cannot survive much longer - this is what people are waking up to - it is literally driving mass extintion and environmental collapse.
So yeah. I get annoyed when some stupid fucking spoiled Kuwaiti brat talks about "being responsible" by stealing his parents oil-sourced electricity to mine bitcoin on outdated and unprofitable technology. It is like a handfull of the worst epitomes of human behaviour wrapped up in one spoiled child.
And then I get even more annoyed when people try to defend it by pointing out the obvious like "mining isn't a charity". Yes, business is not a charity but that doesn't mean people need to accept the "bottom line" that corporations insist on making a priority. Like you say, motivations and principles drive innovations. So the only way we transition from oil to renewables is that we discourage the use of the former and encourage the adoption of the latter.

Basically yes. The BTC is going to be experiencing the 'FUD'  - fear, uncertainty and doubt - until after the UASF comes into play. Both BTC and ETH have already shown declines as a result. 
In all likelihood Coinbase will keep right on working as per usual, but in the event that the unforeseeable happens, if you possess the keys you at least do NOT have to worry about what happens to Coinbase during the storm.

Drop the naivety already. This isn't about being unfairly harsh on what is a very unfortunate-yet-ignorant mistake to make in this space. It also isn't some *motto* that bitcoin enthusiasts just throw around, "be your own bank". 
It is a statement that ought to emphasize the combined risk and responsibility that is inherent in engaging a paradigm shifting technology, well before regulations are adopted in response to the risks inherent to the use of said technology. See how it's paradoxical? Look at what is happening here in Canada with QuadrigaCX? The fucking CEO had to die in India and the Interim CEO file for creditor protection before the courts were involved. This is despite literally tens of thousands of customers filing claims and attempting to engage authorities! Nobody even bothered to look at what was going on until he was dead, and by then it was revealed that the keys to the cold storage went with him.
People like you really piss me off, because you entirely misrepresent the inherent nuances of dealing with a *categorically* new asset type, **of correctly conveying the seriousness by which people should be engaging the system.** What about the phrase "irreversible transfer of value" do you not understand? You compare it to extant technology like stocks and wires-to-bank accounts and paper fucking money as though it were "like that". When in fact it is different in kind, and merely *behaves in ways* that are similar to traditional financial assets.
Instead of recognizing the cold, brutal truth, you imagine some scenario in your fantasy world of traditional assets how someone *like* OP *might* claim a "refund" from the appropriate "authorities", on the grounds of "unjust enrichment". I haven't heard a notion as laughable as CZ's fleeting suggestion of rolling back the ledger because his exchange was hacked and now he's out-of-pocket, owing to his customers that were robbed.
@_date: 2019-05-23 14:50:02
It is suspicious. OP refuses to explain how he got that address to begin with. It appears to be an attempt to gather information on an address that holds millions of dollars worth of crypto.
Are we beginning to understand why Huobi would be legally permitted to simply deny and ignore any request from OP regarding any information on their cold storage?
Just because OP "accidentally" sent 1 BTC there, it does not entitle them to any information or confirmation from Huobi. No lawyer would take this, and any judge would toss this out as the ridiculous claim that it is.
Think about it, sacrificing 1 BTC is nothing if it gains you information that could provide you with a means of narrowing in and hacking a cold storage address.
@_date: 2019-05-23 02:26:33


Then you better jump at the opportunity to represent OP in this clear case of "unjust enrichment"! 
Same goes for someone who has clearly not studied cryptocurrencies by the way...shut the fuck up already with the *terrible advice*.
If you are recommending that OP pursue legal action against Huobi over 1 BTC they sent to an address which Huobi claims they don't operate...yeah, real seasoned advice from a pro. Great lawyering! /s

Riiiiight. And how do you expect that to occur *prior* to the adoption of blockchain technologies? While 90% of the world still believes "bitcoin is for terrorists and drug dealers", or still think in simplistic terms like "blockchain, not bitcoin".
There is quite literally an infinite number of ways this paradigm shift can unfold, but none of them occur overnight. It's taken Bitcoin over a decade and most people either haven't heard of it, or don't yet see the value.
Meanwhile you have populations around the globe questioning their elections, doubting their academics and the media, concerned about the abuse and neglect of corporations over private information collected.


I think you are if what you are saying is you expect more of Coinbase or any other exchange for that matter, given the current state of things.
All exchanges are basically just on-ramps, it's the only service that matters right now, converting the world fiats into cryptocurrency. Only the greedy and stupid leave their coins on the "exchange platform" to facilitate trading. And yes, of course they are going to take advantage of people's ignorance for profit, particulary within the vacuum of regulations. 
Lastly, this is nothing new of corporations in general. They don't push the envelope and initiate change, that is costly and bad for business. Entrepenuers do that, and create incentives to progress to which corporations need to adapt.
Do you think Facebook is going to miraculously adopt the blockchain and encryption and decentralization that will provide the best of both worlds? A decentralized social media platform without risk of compromising privacy? No, that change will come from beneath them and threaten to acquire their customers and make their platform obsolete.

Lastly, where do you see banks in 10 years? Vanished from the face of the earth? Or operating as custodians to the *new* financial standards for clients that are not able to understand keys and secure storage?
Bottom line. Some people will most certainly get ruined trying to be among the first *users* to adopt the new currency. That isn't going to stop it from finding adoption.
Last point. You should really be questioning your logic here in that OP *successfully sent* bitcoin, just to the *wrong address*. Stupid mistake to make, yes. But it is one that is easily avoidable by being prudent and double or triple checking the info before you press send.

What you said makes zero sense. Only a moron would attempt to fork the network and create a "infinitely divisible" chain. That undercuts the scarcity (now an infinite supply), and switches it from a *de*flationary currency back into the same fucking inflationary currency inherent to all fiat on the planet.
If what you are *trying* to argue is regarding sub-satoshi transactions *on the second layer*, that is an entirely different matter. LN is like a PoS system piggybacking on the PoW foundation. Any sub-satoshi amounts on LN would have to be rounded to the nearest satoshi when closing the channel.

No, they wouldn't need to do shit because again, OP is lying and phising for info to try to identify the cold address of an exchange based in Singapore that could hold millions.


I assure you it will be the first thing that happens. Explain to the court OP *how* you came to log what you now believe to be Huobi's cold storage address, and why would you send 1 BTC to it, if not to try and compromise the exchanges security?
It is "just your lawyer opinion" huh, well you're a bad fucking lawyer. OP deserves a lawyer just like you!

If those exposed to it only see it as a get rich quick scheme, they aren't going to endure the crashes.

You need to understand the very fact that you are asking them to check that is a security risk to them. They likely have every right to simply deny and ignore you...legally.
If they confirm you sent it to their cold wallet address directly, they first have to move all the assets from the address. Moving millions of dollars is a risk that will easily trump your 1 BTC in any courtroom. But more likely than not you didn't even send it to their cold address, they probably have it concealed by routing their outputs through intermediaries, and are not required to reveal that for 1 BTC.
Do you understand? It is *suspicious* that you are claiming to have directly sent a deposit to their cold wallet address. They don't want you to *know* what their cold address was. You shouldn't have *had* that address to send BTC to in the first place!

Says the guy setting up and knocking down strawmen over here. You don't know what *I* think of it besides the fact that *I* disagree it is a "waste of energy", because *I* sure as fuck haven't told you.
Every technology has deleterious consequences. Don't be so fucking naive. Just because we are polluting the planet with the combustion of fossil fuels doesn't mean we don't have an underlying necessity to pump and refine and process oil. What would be *nice* however is if we could work towards mitigating the "deleterious consequences" of the technological practices.


Yes, it is being disporportionately ridiculed, because it is a huge draw in a very short span of time. It is novel, and it is disruptive, all *worthy* technologies *should* be disruptive, because they threaten to claim territory from another technological organisms and *drive them to extinction*, like the rotary telephone.
Do you have any fucking idea how much energy it requires to operate your mobile phone and the global cellular and satellite networks for mobile communications? There exist *far more efficient* ways to go about our day-to-day lives, but apparently to humans *convenience is of value*. So we collectively don't give a shit what the consequences are of *enabling the sprawl and adoption* of global cellular technology. Not to mention the waste associated with throwing away perfectly functional devices every few years.


Good. Doesn't mean cars and cities are of no *value*. And as I mentioned above, car emissions are a bad thing and their impacts need to be mitigated, but the solution isn't going to be stopping all production of cars and shutting down the highways, obviously that isn't even in the realm of realism.


I'm not *making any excuses*, paradigm shifting technology doesn't require me or you to *excuse* itself of existence. *If* what you say is true and bitcoin "serves no purpose", it *ought* to depreciate in value, become *more* costly to mine, unprofitable it *will* eventually drift into obscurity. You will see come the next halving however, how it has the opposite effect and drives the value of a single bitcoin to the next plateau, and another bubble.


And to merely reiterate Andreas, people *used to* argue email serves no purpose because *mail* exists.
What if in 10 years time the adoption of cryptocurrency can improve AML/ATF screening by 10%? A 10-fold increase in finances being funnelled into illegal activity?
What if it can damn near eliminate it, 90% plus? Will you see a *purpose* then?
I don't really care if you can not or will not consider the ways this technology will evolve, and the explosion of *purpose* it will find as it adapts.


And what precisely is money used for except trading of *value* (and at least *equally supportive of illicit behaviour*)? I guess you can snort coke up a rolled-up $20, is that proving useful for you?
I'm quite familiar with the practices of AML/ATF/KYC and how *effective* they are at weeding out the bad actors. How "good" is 1%? And that's not improving any either, current practices are fucking costly and *wasteful*, but you may need to reassess your system of value in order to see that.


I agree, all the more reason you need to remove the efficacy inherent in the current landscape to abuse the systems of authority and centralized control of money routing. If it is transparent, then it levels the playing field. 
The system we have is *going* to be replaced, because something better *has* emerged. It will come to eliminate the means of abuse and manipulation inherent to the current network. It won't be *all good*, and without and "deleterious consequences", but it *will* be better or it will go extinct.


Again, that point isn't fucking up for debate pal. Regardless of whether you feel it is energy wasted, it isn't going anywhere - so long as it is *valued* by enough people - the same way Facebook isn't going away because I think it is an ungodly atrocity. As long as enough people *value* something, it survives the pressures of technological selection.

Everyone seems to be misunderstanding that in sending that bitcoin to Huobi's address - an address to which only *Huobi* owns the private keys for - they were effectively transferring ownership to Huobi.
Mistake or not, this IS how bitcoin works. So take this as the *learning opportunity* that it is.
In effect you do not 'own' the bitcoin on any particular address, **you own the keys** to that address. All the more reason to exercise extreme caution and understand the risks when dealing with exchanges, particularly when regulations are still lacking.

Now, cut your losses and move on to the next thread where you can complain that the crypto community shouldn't be upvoting the *correct* conclusions.

No it isn't.
You can have infinity between whole numbers 0 and 1. Each Bitcoin however is divisible only by 100 million Satoshis. Quantified *not* infinite.
@_date: 2019-05-23 03:36:33
No. You *still* do not *get it*.
OP *shouldn't* know Huobi's cold address. Period.
If OP *does*, and actually sent 1 BTC to the address to initiate a claim against Huobi, that is reason alone to suspect OP of malicous intent, and potentially relocate millions of dollars, all for 1 BTC he "mistakenly" sent directly into their god-damned vault!
@_date: 2018-12-02 13:35:16
Uh oh, someone is getting cranky and bitter! Look chief, I can't just keep going round and round explaining this to you. If you cannot understand a simple concept ("mechanism"); that speculative assets necessarily promote *volatile valuation of their worth*, and become more stable the more they demonstrate their utility and find adoption. If you think I'm making it up, find an example to the contrary already. I'm not arguing *your* side of the discussion for you, just because you're too lazy to read, think and research. On that note, you need to refresh your understanding of what the word *tautology* means, because that isn't the first time you used it incorrectly...in this thread.
I assure you, you'll be even pissier when bitcoin breaks 10k again, followed by 100k, and it is consuming enough electricity to power *two* small countries.
Now I've waisted enough time *thinking clearly* for you, and addressing your ridiculous ideas about deflationary currencies and what gives assets *value*.

@_date: 2019-05-22 21:25:33
Yeah. He deleted his post because he got his money back. Sounds about as likely as getting a Singaporean judge to demand Huobi return money to a person that doesn't even understand how they sent it to the wrong address in the first place.
I pity you, but moreso anyone who *depends* on you.
@_date: 2019-05-22 13:49:04
How do Singapore's property laws apply to this situation?
If Huobi *owns* the private keys to the cold wallet address OP sent the BTC to, explain how you think "property laws" are going to provide OP with the private keys Huobi *owns*.
@_date: 2019-05-22 13:53:24
Yes, I insist, do *go on*.
Where is your link to where Huobi confirms those addresses are theirs?
Also, this is beside the point, because ultimately what OP would require to have any case whatsoever is evidence that Huobi *instructed the OP* to deposit BTC to an address they now claim isn't theirs.
@_date: 2018-12-02 05:57:50


How so?


Again, how so?


Um, how did you conclude this erroneous maxim? Because I'm almost certain that one of the largest problems with the extant systems of inflationary currency is the hoarding of wealth to *simulate* scarcity. That is until they simply *print more fucking money*, decreasing the per unit value in the process.


The volatility is due to the fact that it is still new, speculative, and oh, yeah, *at war with the current, global finacial system, in what is quite arguably the most volatile period of human existence*.
We are quite literally facing threats of extinction in a multitude of directions. Whether it be environmental collapse or nuclear war, our future is more *uncertain* now, than ever before. One should *expect volatility* in the current political and economical landscapes. Just look at the fucking NASDAQ and DOW JONES over 2018, though not as volatile as bitcoin, they are showing market fatigue. *People* are uncertain of the future. 


Five fucking posts ago you were arguing it was anonymous and the only *benefit* of it's use was for fucking criminals? Well which is it now?


Things of value *can* be lost, wasted, that is fucking *universal*. Again, that is why bitcoin *has* value, because it is scarce, and can be *wasted*, *lost*, never to be utilized. Name one thing of *value* that can be perpetually replaced as new. And then consider why we think each $1 bill printed "has the same *value*.


You are clearly deluded if you think the current practices are effective at what you suggest. By all means, I'll wait right here, you go research how effective currently AML/ATF practices are at catching criminals and preventing these sorts of crimes and confiscating their funds.

How naive are you? This person wasn't instructed by Huobi to send money to this address. The company has no obligation to track down and redistribute funds that were mistakenly sent to any address they operate.

Did you even listen to his response? I mean, what is the point of posting comments if you ignore the points he makes in like his second or third breath?
Energy consumption is not bad in and of itself, it depends upon where and how your energy is sourced. If there exists an incentive to *source* renewable energy, that is *not* a bad thing, in fact I'd argue it is an inevitable and absolutely *necessary* thing.
He is making the point that energy is the fundamental unit of trade, you don't change that by eliminating Bitcoin, or even substituting PoS for PoW. The transition is being passed from hydrocarbon-based to renewables, the same *pressures* apply to industries **across the board**. There is just as much incentive for Google and Apple to follow suit, and it is no coincidence you see resistance to such efforts. Look at Maduro and his attempt to plant a petroleum-linked cryptocurrency as the national fiat of Venezuela, *that* is the "bitcoin" that deliberately seeks to be *dependant* upon carbon-emitting resources into the future indefinitely.
Furthermore, it is too easy for critics to dismiss the defense of Bitcoin mining as resorting to "whataboutism", as is *so fucking prevalent in this thread*. Cryptocurrencies are being disproportionately ridiculed for *their* demand for energy. They are the newest industry to emerge and yes, they demand a lot of fucking electricity. But people would be wise to consider that within the correct context, and that is they demand [no more than the current global system of data centers]( which is where we are at with the traditional practice of double-bookkeeping across privately controlled financial networks. 
So, by all means, continue deliberating about this point all you want - and dismissing his points *made* as "tautologies for weak minds" - it isn't going to have any bearing on whether or not Bitcoin is adopted. I personally think it is a feature, not a *bug*, to have the cost of electricity correlated with the pulse of your financial network, and we will discover precisely why that is the closer we get to adoption. I believe the end result will be a less volatile and more accurate assessment of the true cost of utilizing the resources that we do, in every industry around the globe.

*Adoption* will "ground it". Why are you so fucking obtuse? Do you not understand how highly speculative things are necessarily volatile in their valuation? And "stable" investments are only "stable" becuase they have already satutated the market and minimized volatility? You invest in GIC's you're guaranteed a return, but also guaranteed it won't be considerably more than what can be *guaranteed*.


Said the ignoramus about the currency that already cut it's teeth in the digital black market for a solid half-decade before institutional investors began recognizing the utility and investing in it for themselves, as a store of value.

Um, do they actually let you withdraw your bitcoin?
They had full page ads in the Sun back in 2017 nearing ATH. Had a 4 month "draw" with 1 customer winning 1 BTC each month heading into 2018 as the price was plummeting.
Then it was revealed their app would let you "buy bitcoin", but you didn't control the keys and couldn't withdraw it from mogo, only option was to wait and resell within mogo (at a loss) after the slide.

And now he's removed his post because it has become apparent how embarrassing it is that he just randomly sent 1 BTC to an unknown address.

In fact, there *is* an official statement that this news is 'rumour and speculation'.
From another post:
[Samsung dismisses Galaxy S10 crypto wallet reports as 'rumour and speculation'](
With that being said however, Samsung has been utilizing secure ARM-TEE chips in their phones since the Galaxy S3 (with the intention they would be used by the banking industry, ironically enough). [Ledger announced years ago]( they had a working Beta of their Trustlet app for the Galaxy S6 line of phones.
Bottom line is they already *have* the required secure chips installed in *most* of their phones. So like many other areas of the crypto landscape, people have to remain patient for the necessary applications to be developed and permitted and released.

Before you start making assumptions and declarations about what laws *I* am familiar with, I insist you read this sentence you posted again.
Ownership is most certainly about the "control" in this matter, being that OP handed it over to the **owner of the private keys that control the address**. 
Next, I also insist you provide the set of cryptocurrency laws and regulations you *assume* apply to OPs case regarding "ownership" and "control", because by and large they do *not* yet exist.

Yeah, sure, no big deal for the exchange to have to sweep millions of dollars because a fucking *liar* claims they figured out your cold storage address and sent funds directly to it.

@_date: 2019-05-22 11:15:08
No, what they are saying is your *story* doesn't make sense because exchanges don't advertise their cold wallet addresses.
*How* did you get this cold wallet address you *claim* is owned by Huobi? Did Huobi direct you to send funds to this address?
Did you receive a withdrawal from Huobi in the past and then just *assume* you could send bitcoin *back* to that address and would have access to it from your Huobi account?
One thing for sure is that if Huobi didn't *prompt* you to send bitcoin to that address, then it is all on you and nobody is going to help you, because nobody is *required to*.
Edit: Thanks to the gold-giver!

No, they straddle. One foot firmly in the old fiat world, one firmly in crypto land. That's the way transitioning *works*. Nobody is going to successfully sidestep the governmental requirements to maintain KYC/ATF/AML.


I mean, where did you think the money was going to come from? How *else* did you expect people to move their finances into the landscape? Yes, from traditional banking institutions into the cryptocurrency space. Banks have to maintain KYC, therefore any business that intends to work with them has to KYC also.
I guess I'm confused by the surprise in your post. Like, what alternative did you imagine? All governments just doing away with the KYC policies?
@_date: 2019-05-23 10:12:02
Yes, the exchange has to sweep their cold storage because *if* OP somehow figured out which cold address was their's, that alone compromises their security. It's as if you don't understand how operational security fucking works.
Tell me, do you think any lawyer or judge in the world would agree that an exchange would be required to take such risk and expense to verify and refund a moron who claims to have done such a suspicious transaction "by mistake".
Shove off retard, it isn't a "bank error in Huobi's favor", it is an obvious attempt to phish information to identify which company operates an address holding millions of dollars.
And I'm beginning to believe this thread is just filled with alt accounts from OP because every single one of you morons defending him talk exactly the same way, make the same stupid 'points' about "the exchange doesn't need to send him back *that* bitcoin!"
No, the exchange doesn't owe him *any* bitcoin. They claim it isn't their address and they are allowed to do so *because* of their security, and the security of all their other clients that could hold funds in said cold storage.

It goes to show that even the most successful and talented people cannot keep up with the evolving technology and shifting paradigms forever. To many esteemed dinosaurs, the technology is simply too complicated to trust, and thus marginalized as merely a trend.
"If *I* can't understand it, surely the average person won't either, and thus it will *never* be accepted."
It is remarkable how many can think things similar to this, despite the advent of the internet and cell phones and all the technology that has invaded our lives without requiring the vast majority to understand *how* it works.
Someone should ask him about the rich diveristy of governance and supply management networks that have also been afforded by Satoshi's gift of the blockchain solution.
@_date: 2019-05-23 01:54:33


No, you haven't. This is what *you* are failing to understand. Having you trying to explain it to me "as a layman" is not the problem here. It is partly because you are *not* a lawyer (or at least not a *good* one), and partly because you are ignorant of how impossible it is for OP to verify their claim. Just admit it already, you have no idea what you're talking about. You probably only learned of unjust enrichment today.












So correct me esquire, this is my interpretation of the above:
(i) *Demonstrate Huobi gained*
(ii) *Demonstrate OP lost*
(iii) *The "unjust factor" is that OP* **neglectfully and mistakenly** *addressed a transaction directly to Huobi's cold storage address. Huobi was not the source of the "unjust factor", the claim is that they were enriched*
(iv) *You really don't think Huobi's lawyers would be able to mount an effective defense?*
How about the part I highlighted above regarding the defendant *subjectively devaluing the enrichment?* If OP cannot demonstrate that Huobi operates the address, that is one thing. But even if Huobi were to *admit* it is their address in court, they would have to be the party to also confirm OP's claims about the transaction not being initiated by an employee simply moving funds within Huobi, verifying that they indeed received 1 BTC unsolicited that accounts for said "enrichment". That would likely *cost* Huobi more money than OP is claiming they were enriched by, and therefore Huobi is literally paying for OP's idiotic mistake of sending a deposit directly to a cold storage address, instead of to his exchange wallet.
Tell me, 1 BTC is currently valued at about $7600 USD. How much of your time does that buy? Would you take this case? Do you think you could convince a judge that Huobi is obligated to *spend money* confirming OP's claims and returning the funds?


Why. Because OP says so? Even if OP thinks they have "confirmed" the address belongs to Huobi, it might *not* belong to Huobi. Exchanges aren't exactly transparent about their operations, you are aware of this? It was revealed with the QuadrigaCX case that the CEO was paying out clients from wallets *controlled by competing cryptocurrency exchanges*. That means when OP initiated a withdrawal months back and took down that sender address and idiotically earmarked it as his "Huobi wallet address", it could have been Kraken's, or Coinbase's, or Binance's, or literally anyone's on the planet. Huobi doesn't need to reveal their entire security practices just because some idiot says he accidentally sent 1 BTC to an address he *believes* is theirs. They can just claim that they initiated the transfer but that the address OP *sent* his BTC to belongs to an intermediary processor. Every new "defendant" could easily kick the can down the road.
Again, people keep *comparing* this to a bank error where the defendant and claimant are both clients of the bank. In the event of an error it is immediately obvious what the "unjust factor" is. It isn't that the client "just made a mistake", but rather that someone within the institution did. The bank guarantees their clients with accuracy when employing transfers using the double-bookkeeping method, and if a mistake is made they are *obligated* to investigate it, but regardless of the specific error they can simply "credit" the claimant and "debit" the defendant while the figure out where the funds actually went. No such laws apply in this scenario.
Now, I'm fucking done explaining this to you. So if you're a fucking lawyer and think OP has a shot in hell, then go fucking represent him already. Be sure to let us know how many times you are laughed at along your way to ultimate failure.
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:03:45

Any judge brought this case would grill OP on precisely the point he *refuses to answer*; How did you acquire this address? Why did you send 1 BTC to it?
Then OP would just walk out of the court room without answering, just like he deleted his comments in the title post and walked out of the thread. He is *lying*.
