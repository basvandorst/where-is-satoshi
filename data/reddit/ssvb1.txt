You are just assuming that there will be exactly no improvements in electronics, storage and network technologies during these 26 years which could allow to safely increase the block size limit without compromising decentralization.
And you are also assuming that the Lightning Network design is set in stone and will see no improvements in all these 26 years. While things like Channel Factories are being investigated.
So your estimation is in fact unreasonably pessimistic.

The operator of the node on the other side of your channel can't see the final destinations of your payments. So your payments can't be selectively blocked and thus the other party can't do [censoring by definition](


You don't need to close your channel to verify it. What makes you think that you do?

More than half of Bitcoin transactions are not using Segwit yet. So those who make these non-Segwit transactions, most likely believe that the transaction fees are still way too low for them to bother.
Segwit adoption percentage is a good indicator, which shows that transactions fees are not a problem *today*. And it's a perfect time to improve user friendliness of Lightning wallet applications and PoS terminals.

I think that a much better example is GCC vs. Clang. Both are open source compilers and both can work as drop-in replacements for each other because they implement the same ANSI/ISO C language standard.
Naturally, GCC developers did not like Clang and thought that it would be best if everyone just contributed to the development of GCC. However Clang solved many problems that GCC developers even refused to acknowledge in the first place. For example, Clang provided much more comprehensive error messages and warnings, which greatly improved usability. GCC had to catch up and improved as well.
There are a lot more examples. Multiple web browsers exist, they are implementing the same W3C standards and are drop-in replacements for each other.
Reinventing the wheel has a positive effect because it prevents stagnation. Interoperability is ensured by implementing the same standards.

There are already potential quantum resistant replacements available for ECDSA and can be taken into use if necessary: 
But there is just no need to rush it because:
 * Quantum resistant algorithms are still relatively new and are being reviewed by crypto researchers. It is possible that even better algorithms will emerge in a few years.
 * The size of quantum resistant signatures is much larger compared to the signatures currently used by Bitcoin. And as long as quantum computers are still far from becoming a real threat, bloating the blockchain unnecessarily is not very reasonable.

My understanding of the problem is that some people probably treat these seed phrases as regular "passwords" and expect to have more or less the same passwords handling experience as they are used to. I mean, they may wrongly assume that wallet developers can just "reset the password" if necessary. Because this kind of functionality is often offered by various password protected services.
If a wallet application asks the user to write down the seed phrase and then re-enter it, then it looks very similar to the familiar registration forms where people need to type their password twice (or just copy-paste it).
I'm suggesting a quiz with a set of questions to ensure that the user clearly understands the importance of saving the seed phrase in a safe place and the fact that nobody else would be able to help them if this seed phrase is lost. We need to educate the users rather than annoy them by forcing them to do a mindless seed phrase typing exercise.

Does it change anything if you use different addresses on the blockchain to store these bitcoins rather than mix them together?
I mean, you buy 1 BTC for 3000€ and withdraw it to the address X. Then you buy 1 BTC for 7000€ and withdraw it to the address Y. When you decide to sell 1 BTC, you are depositing it to a crypto exchange from the address Y. All these moves of your funds are recorded in the public ledger and the First-in First-out order makes no sense at all. Because you have a proof that you moved your 1 BTC from the address Y and not from the address X.
I would assume that if you withdraw both of your bitcoins to the address X and then move 1 BTC to an exchange, then the tax office indeed may apply the First-in First-out rule.
Maybe it's best to ask for a clarification?

If you are keeping all your crypto savings in a hot wallet, then you may lose everything on some unlucky day and won't be saved by the on-chain magic.
For example, there was a recent vulnerability in Electrum wallet application, which allowed malicious websites to steal your coins: 
There were also a lot of vulnerabilities in other software and system components, which could allow hackers to get access to the data on your phone or computer. Thus giving them an opportunity to steal your private key.
TL;DR; If anything is connected to the Internet, then it may be hacked some day.

Is this article actually the official statement of the German tax office? Google translate seems to interpret it as if the First-in First-out order is used for the *"reasons of simplification"*. I have also found one more article about German bitcoin taxation [here]( and it makes everything even more confusing (either *"it is possible to individually allocate every good sold"* or *"in the absence of a legal directive, the purchase costs must be calculated at average values"*).
Moreover, please consider the following example. Imagine that you are that guy who got 10000 BTC for pizza in the ancient bitcoin history. And since you did not consider it as anything valuable back then, you happened to lose your private key. Now fast forward to the present days. You bought 1 BTC for 3000€ and 1 BTC for 7000€. And now you decide to sell 1 BTC. Which of them is it going to be? Yeah, that's right, it is going to be a pizza bitcoin according to the First-in First-out rule. Now you are screwed for the rest of your life and can't realistically ever sell any BTC. Unless you hide the fact that you ever had these 10000 BTC. But we can also add a plot twist, where you somehow manage to recover the private key for your old pizza bitcoins later (let's say, from an old laptop in your closet). What happens to your taxes now?
I still would suggest to ask for an official clarification from the tax office.
As for a way around the First-in First-out rule (if it really applies), you can still probably use a set of different cryptocurrencies. Let's say, BTC for long term investments, ETH for short term trading and also LTC just in case if these two are not enough.

People are always risking to lose their coins in hot wallets, with or without lightning. Just like they are risking to lose cash that they carry around in their pockets.

It means that miners may freely move between BTC and BCH depending on their mood or the current price situation, resulting in wild changes of the hashrate.
If one of the coins has a lot more hashrate than the other, then even a single major pool of the dominating coin may successfully 51% attack the lesser coin.

You would only get an increased cost of running a node without any fundamental improvements because:
  * with 1-2MB block size limit, we can run nodes on cheap embedded devices with passive cooling and home internet connection, but can't scale to 7 billion users without layer 2 solutions and other optimizations.
  * with 8-32-64MB block size limit, running nodes would require server grade hardware and datacenter internet connection, but still wouldn't be able to scale to 7 billion users either.
Moreover, just increasing hardware requirements would only result in a temporary relief. People would be sitting on their hands and doing nothing, optimistically expecting that simple block size limit increases are a universal magic solution.
There is one more thing. Abundant cheap block space won't remain cheap and abundant very long. It's going to be instantly used up by Tether, Veriblock and other similar things, thus bringing us back to square one.

If I never lock the door, then why hasn't my house been robbed yet?
Well, maybe pool operators are just reluctant to do something that is very clearly a criminal activity? But if double spend attacks were perfectly legal, then a large Bitcoin pool operator would probably just do the following:
* Gradually move half of the hashrate to BCH without notifying the miners.
* Convert the mined BCH to BTC and keep paying the miners, so that they don't have any reason to suspect anything.
* If at some point the BCH hash power is enough for 51% attacking the network, then:
 * Start secretly mining blocks without announcing them to the BCH network.
 * Move some large sum of BCH to an exchange, convert it to BTC and withdraw BTC from the exchange.
 * Announce the mined blocks to the network and make sure that the original BCH transfer to the exchange did not happen (just move the funds to some other address under your control).
 * Profit.

Blackberry wasn't the fastest smartphone in 2009 because iPhone 3GS already existed back then.
I agree that smartphone processors evolved much faster than desktop processors during the last decade, but I think that this happened largely because smartphone processors initially lagged behind and were catching up with desktop processors in terms of the used architecture optimizations. Cortex-A8 from iPhone 3GS was an in-order dual-issue superscalar design, somewhat comparable to the original Intel Pentium from 1993 (also an in-order dual-issue superscalar design). But now smartphone processors more or less reached architecture features parity with desktop processors and there are no low hanging fruits for them anymore.
Early SSDs were also way smaller than the good old spinning disks.
I still think that looking at the desktop processors gives us a better idea about the speed of technological progress.

Bitcoin is a modern digital form of money, secured by cryptography and implemented in a trustless and decentralized manner. If you check the wikipedia article about [money]( then you can find its list of functions as defined by William Stanley Jevons back in 1875:
* medium of exchange
* unit of account
* standard of value (omitted from modern textbooks)
* store of value
That's where this *"store of value"* thing comes from. It was not something that had been invented by bitcoin developers. Needless to say that the *"medium of exchange"* function is also extremely important. That's why the work is ongoing on improving the Lightning Network, which brings instant secure low fee payments to Bitcoin.

I replied to [your comment]( where you made a very much debatable claim about losing coins being supposedly less likely now thanks to some mysterious efforts.
You only mentioned the introduction of 24 word seeds, which ironically makes it easier to lose coins. I'm not sure if you will be able to comprehend this, but the whole point of introducing these [horse-staple-style]( seeds was to make them *much easier to remember* for humans (compared to alphanumeric gibberish with the same amount of entropy). As a result, people obsessed with security are more likely to have their seeds memorized rather than written on a sheet of paper and stored somewhere. It's great for ensuring that nobody can steal their coins, however their coins are also guaranteed to be lost after they die (and it's only a matter of time).
The only thing that actually reduces the gradual loss of coins is the existence of custodial wallets. But I'm not sure if this is good for bitcoin.

Huh? Please don't put words in my mouth. I never said that *all bitcoin* will be lost.


You are just ignoring the fact that the number of bitcoin users also increases. What really matters is how much value is owned per person rather than the nominal price of 1 bitcoin.
For example, if somebody buys $10 worth of bitcoin today and moves them to a mobile wallet on a smartphone, then this person is probably not going to be super motivated to take special efforts to backup the seed regardless of what is the exchange rate.


It's still very easy to lose bitcoins and it's a part of the bitcoin design. Just lose your keys and *nobody can help you*.
Are you storing your seed backup on a sheet of paper somewhere in the same house as your computer with your cold wallet? Congratulations, you may probably lose both of them in case of fire.

This service looks like a custodial web wallet with BTC deposits/withdrawals via LN.
I registered there to check what it looks like and they donated me 1000 satoshi (~10 cents). There is also some kind of tutorial which grants prizes for various achievements (enable 2FA and other steps). The whole thing looks rather user friendly. My only concern is that it is a custodial service and its users are trading their freedom for convenience. For example, this 1000 satoshi bonus that I received is just a record in their database and does not exist anywhere on the Bitcoin blockchain. If any curious user abandons a newly created account after playing with it, then Bottle is not even losing these 1000 satoshi. Because again, this is just a record in their database. Custodial services can print Bitcoins out of thin air as long as these funds never (or rarely) leave their system.

Segwit is not a panacea. But it does work as a dynamic block size limit. The practical on-chain transactions capacity increases for everyone if the percentage of segwit usage becomes higher.
Those who still don't use segwit, are paying higher transaction fees themselves. And their choice not to use segwit can be interpreted as a message *"transaction fees are not high enough for us to bother"* to the rest of the bitcoin community. They are basically voting with their wallets.
I'm going to start worrying about the necessity of further on-chain capacity increases after segwit usage gets closer to 80-100%. Because this would mean that the headroom provided by segwit has been used up.

100% segwit adoption would result in something like ~1.7MB blocks instead of the current ~1.3MB blocks.
But my point is different. Today bitcoin clearly does not need any block size limit increases because roughly half of its users *do not want* to reduce their on-chain transaction fees. Segwit adoption percentage is a great indicator, which allows us to monitor the situation.
In the future a lot of users may start doing most of their everyday payments on the Lightning Network and thus reduce the on-chain transactions pressure. Or BTC may need to further increase the block size limit in some way (assuming that the hardware and network technologies improve). But today transaction fees are obviously not a problem.

@_date: 2018-12-09 11:15:33
Genesis block starts from an empty UTXO set and every current UTXO in bitcoin can be traced back to coinbase transactions in blocks. Thus we can verify that everything adds up properly.
We can't cut off the blockchain history and make 2015 a new start because old blocks from 2015 did not carry UTXO commitments yet.
But it should be possible to add UTXO commitments support to the bitcoin code and maybe one year later use the first block with UTXO commitment as the new genesis. UTXO commitment is basically a cryptographically secure hash, calculated over the UTXO set. Bitcoin would need to carry a database with the initial UTXO set and the only way to verify its correctness is to check whether the UTXO commitment hash matches. As the UTXO commitment hash is buried under a year's worth of blocks, it's very difficult to replace this hash. But what if somebody figures out how to create a fake UTXO set with an additional UTXO entry, which matches the old hash?

Thanks! But looks like has incorrect calculations at least in the *"3.1 Temporary Block Withholding"* part. The equation assumes that the attack becomes profitable when the attacker wastes the same number of blocks as the honest miners. But since the attacker has lower hashrate than the rest of the network, wasting equal number of blocks actually reduces the percentage of blocks found by the attacker. I have written a simple simulation script and the actual crossover point seems to be around ~37% instead of ~29%. This is still lower than 50%, but nowhere as bad as 29%.
The other calculations also need to be verified.
