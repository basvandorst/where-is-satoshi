I have never heard of Dragon's Tale! Neat! How much BTC have you made with the site??  I originally bought some and have been doing a little alt coin trading recently.  I started a cryptocurrency twitter, shameless plug  when I started trading and I'm trying to get donations too! None yet so far tho :) but i'm new. I'm also making crypto related Rap songs! I want to help spread the demographic of bitcoin and show it is accessible to average people!  Rap listeners are on average young technology and social media focused people, I think hip-hop artists could benefit from accepting bitcoin tips for songs/mixtapes!  Trying to help the revolution :)

Yes! Remember it's just for fun and practice, I'm hoping to keep getting better!  The upcoming Bitcoin Rap is going to be more planned out with better production value, full of more crypto punch lines puns double entendres and metaphors!  
  PotCoin Rap -   
Vericoin Rap- 
Twitter -   
  "RIP Litecoin" single dropping sometime today too! ;) Ft.  Rookie Crypto! 
   
Thanks for your support!

Thanks! really means a lot! Yeah this was kinda a trial run / drum up interest see if anybody wants me to do more + really quick and dirty, recorded with iPhone with dying laptop playing the instrumentals lol.  If anybody cares to donate BTC or other coins in the addresses I put on youtube that would be fantastic and motivate me to do better/more, every bit helps :D I'm trying to get my first whole Bitcoin this summer!  Support  and the vision to bring Bitcoin and Crypto to new markets!   
To ~~the moon~~ MARS!
