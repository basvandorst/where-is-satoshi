You also have no backing for your comment about it sending the world into a global depression where everyone rots in ditches. Youre assuming. Something like his has never. Ever happened before and youre trying to say you KNOW how it works. Keep saying it can't happen slowly, and I'll keep saying I don't know what's gonna happen. But I won't be foolish enough to rule things out like you.

Makes you technically one in a million. Assuming all bitcoins are going to be used.

its multiple bonds, and theyre all fractions of 1 %
@_date: 2014-05-12 16:58:00
oddly enough i work for the ohio lottery commission, so im kind of unable to win  :P but the advice is suitable, im just unconvinced that having it sit in a bond is going to be better for me than having it sit in cold storage. your january analogy is solid, and perhaps that will only continue, but if a dropping trend starts, i could of course sell quickly, maybe lose 100$ and learn my lesson
@_date: 2014-11-13 04:33:35
ahhh good question. No auto correct. I had been watching the EMA lines for literally 2 months, trying to judge when a cross over would happen. it came close the last rally. And on the markets subreddit i posted that we were getting close a while back. When i finally saw the confirmation i was losing it in my car. actually pulled over after i posted so i could open up a trade.
What i meant to say, was THIS IS IT GENTLEMEN, because the time had finally come for the bull market
@_date: 2014-11-15 01:18:31
has nothing to do with sex, noticed i asked how she knew about open bazaar. bitcoin has breached less than 1% of the population, and probably 5 percent of that group is up to date on what bitcoin is doing. we're looking at maybe 1 million people that know about open bazaar, this is what i was amazed with
@_date: 2014-09-08 15:58:00
Lol. To the ground!
@_date: 2014-09-08 16:01:42
What could this mean for open bazaar. If PayPal accepts eBay will. Millions of merchants will. Because its obviously a better choice. But all the crowd funding. All the development for open bazaar will be worth 1/10th of what it could have been. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:21:26
i crunched some rough numbers, nothing finite, but in order for you to turn 20k of that money, into the same profit youd have to buy now, and the price would need to hit 850. so assume you bought 20k of bitcoin. if your goal is to make a profit similar to or better than that of your 401k, the price of a bitcoin would have to touch 850 within the next 5 years. 
If it doesnt hurt you to invest in any way shape or form, and youre fine with possibly losing the money it just comes down to "do you think within the next five years bitcoin will touch 850 a coin. if so youll be profiting"

lol, i wont lie, my friends think im a big deal now, i showed them the memes, the front page status, its all pretty cool. Never been internet famous. I guess these are my 10 minutes :P

is buying high and selling low ever a good idea? dont be silly. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 16:43:37
i wasnt sure how large they were, but i assumed he would invest 20k, instead of 22. so maybe thats close

hell yeah, maybe one or 2 of them will get just as excited and perpetuate the cycle. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:10:09
I'll agree with this. sounds like something a politician would do. The only reason i was really mentioning that he is independant is hopefully some of the democrats, and some of the republicans among us would be interested. Rather than if i just stated a republican candidate  and lose all democratic interest.

Your wallet ratio comment is garbage. I have 12, wallets and only store bitcoin in 1. I made a few when I was learning bitcoin. This doesn't mean anything. 
Regardless of course rich people own more than poor people. Youre stating it as if its a shut down of bitcoin. Its simply a true statement that doesn't affect anything. 
Youre blockchain info is nifty, but I can help but feel its wrong. More people certainly know about bitcoin than every before. And youre trying to treat that as a bad thing too.   
@_date: 2014-11-05 16:20:54
Would you consider scholarships for young bitcoin enthusiasts and activists like myself

There's quite a few large companies that are fully up to date with what bitcoin can do for them, but they've openly stated bitcoins market cap is just too low. They would require perhaps 2000$ coins, so that they could move their significant amounts of money during purchase orders and so on. The truth is our market cap matters, and it matters to big players that want to use bitcoin
@_date: 2015-05-28 22:51:22

Then you didn't look up project Ara. Its a modular phone. You buy a "trezor" and put it in your phone. The modular piece you bought isn't made by google. Its made by any third party, or even yourself 
@_date: 2015-01-16 19:11:02
If you're wanting to find returns, and along with that, risk your current money. I'd suggest at least learning a trade. More specifically learning to trade markets. If you want to become a trader we have a reddit with a lot of experienced people, but be aware, similar to gambling you will lose money, however there are chances for high % returns. You can make money when the value of bitcoin goes down, as well as when bitcoin goes up. Do some research and ask some questions. At least if you lose money this way youre at least learning *something* where as gambling doesn't have to many lessons
@_date: 2015-01-23 06:35:07
That's.... Kind of awesome
@_date: 2015-01-16 18:23:20
Look up Google's project Ara. There will without a doubt be a modular hardware wallet that you can stick in one of those slots
