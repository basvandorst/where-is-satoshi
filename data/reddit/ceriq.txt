I don't have a cake but I have some chocolate shake flavored water?
If that's acceptable, then I'm at 1Bu2mL1QZPDk7Q92spRoyMoipHdwbG1mzn. =)
Oh and happy birthday!

Actually, Stack Exchange was always semi expensive. They didn't want crap postings from people looking for a personal slave for 10 bucks a week, and they gave you a match guarantee. If you didn't find anyone to hire, they gave you your money back.
