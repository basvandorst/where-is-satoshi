The OP in the thread (InterestedParty) is John Kothanek, who is now a Regulatory Compliance Investigator at Coinbase, and previously was in a similar role for PayPal from its early days.

You're right, it's long. The last posts are from three months ago though.
I thought it would be interesting for others to see what these banking compliance people are saying among each other. There just seems to be a lot of confusion, uncertainty and worry from them.
Of course there's some positive stuff as well.
"I would also think that since the regulators are not onboard with Bitcoms the downside of dealing with the companies using/selling/brokering is much greater than any possible upside (fees)."
"and banks who provide a channel for bitcoin-type cashing in will be under much greater scrutiny in the near future..."
"Reading through the bitcoin magazine, it seems to me to be a huge advertisement for money-laundering and terrorist financing. Why would any FI be willing to bank a bitcoin broker, or even a user? THe regulatory downside is just too great. I don't kiss cobras or jump into bonfires either."
"I have a customer who used "CoinTerra". What are we supposed to do with customers who purchase Bitcoins? Has anyone come up with any procedures or action plans?"
"I just found a consumer account with an ACH debit originated by Coinbase.com and since I have never heard of this name I Googled it to find that they are an "international digital wallet dealing in Bitcoins". So I suppose that our customer has invested in Bitcoins. Aside from the fact that I would never invest in something that I don't understand I see no reason to risk-rate him any higher than what our risk-rating system calculated and since he is a consumer who purchased them rather than a business involved in Bitcoin exchanges I won't do anything further. Any other thoughts or opinions?"

I just tried it too. Even with my BitInstant account with tons of broken transactions, this worked pretty smoothly.
I was able to get it set up and get bitcoins using money from my bank account within minutes. This is a pretty big development for one of bitcoin's sources of friction.

This situation won't happen because Coinbase does not accept credit cards.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:56:38
Weekends too. I made a deposit on Thursday and it just cleared this morning.
@_date: 2013-05-18 00:23:24
Turns out Coinbase doesn't accept debit cards either.

The wallet is encrypted in your browser (client-side) using JavaScript code before it is sent to blockchain.info. Therefore blockchain.info only has a hash of your password and an encrypted version of your wallet.
When you sign on, blockchain.info checks that your password hash matches against the stored hash. If it does, blockchain.info sends you the encrypted version of your wallet. In your browser, the JavaScript uses the password you entered to decrypt the encrypted version of your wallet. All transactional activities including creating/signing transactions occur in the JavaScript in your browser. In fact, you can even disconnect from the Internet after the blockchain.info page loads and it would still function, but you would need to reconnect to the Internet to allow the transaction to propagate to the rest of the world.
The disadvantage is that an encrypted copy of your wallet is stored on blockchain.info's server. If their server security were to be breached, a hacker could brute force weak passwords and decrypt some stored wallets.
In addition, if you enable two-factor authentication, this only protects the authentication with the blockchain.info website. If their server gets hacked or someone somehow otherwise gets a copy of the backup of your encrypted wallet, they would only need to brute force or correctly guess the password of your encrypted wallet to decrypt it, no two-factor authentication acquired.

It might be helpful to state why you are qualified to start this or your qualifications first! That will better attract qualified candidates.

They could've saved themselves a lot of trouble had they used Bitcoin to move the money out of the country.

You can compare to Litecoin or other altcoins for real-world examples.

More adult sites should get on board with Bitcoin. Since they usually have a high chargeback rate with credit cards and costly merchant fees as a result of the risk, I'm sure they would love the irreversible aspect and low cost of Bitcoin.

It actually works by withdrawing the stated USD $ amount of X number of coins you set at the time of purchase, even if you check the box to purchase at whatever the market price is in a few days. They start withdrawing that fixed USD $ amount from your bank account immediately, and in a few days, when it clears, they'll purchase for you the number of bitcoins worth the amount of USD $ initially stated at the present market rate.
So your spending cost is fixed at the beginning. I tried it to make sure.

I placed an order within the past week and I can verify that it does work the way I stated above. That's why they change the form label to say "Buy approximately ___ BTC", i.e. it's just an estimate of the number of bitcoins you'll actually get. I agree they could improve the way it is described.
Also worth noting, if you go into order history, you can also cancel a pending order if you placed it this way - any time before it executes.

On the payment page, it links to a Bitcoin URI and provides a link for getting a Bitcoin client. It doesn't require buyers to sign up or anything, so I think it's not bad. :)

Got it! Thanks for the tip, I'll do my best to pay it forward.

Yes, you will have only bought $136.50 / $150 of a bitcoin (deposited amount divided by market price at the effective transaction time), which is 0.91 BTC.

Hopefully it'll be back in 2 weeks.

This looks great. Could you give more information about which stamp product you got and what size? I'd like to get one too :).

Awesome, thanks! My first bitcointip ever.

They don't let you buy BTC on a credit card, rather when you sell BTC to them, they'll issue a credit for that amount to your debit card so you get it faster.

It would be helpful to get more data, like historic price and volume at this exchange. Without this and other key metrics, serious traders can't really get into it. Is this exposed via an API or available somewhere?
@_date: 2013-05-18 00:41:29
lol :)

Cool, I made one that collects addresses to try it out. I'm selling a postcard from SF sent to anywhere in the world:
Looks great!
Minor nitpick but the title formatting is a bit funky with long text, and what rate do you use for the conversion?

Just wondering if anyone has experience with it, how long does it take CampBX to process domestic wire transfer withdrawals usually?
