No worries. I totally understand your frustration. I'm quite irritated as well. These antics make Bitcoin look bad and I've gotten the impression from Reddit that Coinbase doesn't care as much as they should about customer service.

Try Coinbase or LocalBitcoins.

Thanks for the tip! We'll look into it.

I'm not whining to Reddit. It was a legitimate question to see if I should contact my bank or just wait it out. I did not even contact Coinbase because I know they're dealing with a lot of issues right now.
I use Coinbase for their merchant tools. I'm not buying Bitcoin speculatively, but rather accepting it as payment from my clients. Coinbase's incompetence is screwing with my business cash flow. Luckily, I really want Bitcoin to succeed and will continue accepting it, just perhaps not through Coinbase.
Were I a business owner less invested in its success, I might stop accepting Bitcoin. It's vital that the exchanges get their acts together if we have a hope of Bitcoin becoming mainstream.

Lol! Appreciate the South Park reference. I'm not really just starting out, just starting to accept btc. This is my day job and I have a company. I'm already advertising that I accept bitcoin via the normal channels, and my connections tend to be libertarians that actually know what bitcoin is, so I guess I'm going to work my network!

I was at the Mises Store during it's very first Bitcoin transaction. :)
Enjoy the books. I ordered some as well.

Just a word of warning: I use Coinbase for invoicing my clients that want to pay in BTC. They are getting a bad reputation for crummy customer service and my last withdrawal is a day late so far. Granted, I withdrew during a very high volume time. But stuff like that can be bad for a business's cash flow. It makes me wary of relying on them in the future.

Thanks, I'll look into those. I'm mainly using Coinbase because of the merchant tools. I just accept BTC from my clients and their screwing up my deposits is hurting my business cash flow. Not cool.

I've been looking into getting one of your mattresses for a while now. I've gotta say, this makes me way more likely to go through with it.
