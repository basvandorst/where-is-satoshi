Because your Trezor is not fake?
@_date: 2016-08-18 21:01:37
Well said new redditor. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 21:11:15
Half way to the ATH. 
@_date: 2016-08-09 07:40:02
How is it a scam if they make you whole?
@_date: 2016-04-15 23:05:29
@_date: 2018-01-12 05:40:19
It’s not unheard of with low fees these days. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:47:41
Ya, only the cool countries are allowed. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:40:08
It was more usable as a currency before half the world jumped in. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:45:31
Someone has to use that electricity. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:29:31
Sounds like paradise. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 03:49:31
Jeezuz, glad I’m not “many people”. Sorry for your loss. 
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:19:49
Why would this be?
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:33:14
Brian is the rider and Ver is the bike?
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:47:50
Hey! That’s our dreamy Justin you’re talking about. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:56:40


Read this as “Everyone should be able to archive wealth”. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:24:15
9 days later... enjoy. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:58:25
Everyone dies. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:42:50
And a car, then foot. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:34:12
It has never been guaranteed. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:24:40
But binancecoin is one of the very few on the rise in this downturn. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:06:00
Started going down, cashed out, went up fast, lost out. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:20:26
3 days to 2 weeks or more. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 00:46:16
When your mining rig is in an igloo, there’s no need for liquid cooling. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:53:53
So 21.00000000 bucks then. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 22:38:49
We have the best fees, All our fees are great, no one has greater fees than us. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:33:33
This one is highly centralized, you know, secret recipe and all. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:13:56
Exactly. Knowing tops and bottoms in the crypto world requires a crystal ball. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:16:23
But you can’t choose which tx’s to include after the fact. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:20:53
They have to. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:51:24
What do you call it when someone sets up a node to rebroadcast low fee tx’s for longer than default?
@_date: 2018-01-14 07:39:57

BTC in the future will be worth at least 0 dollars or more. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 03:24:05
Gotta tranquillize him first. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:28:13
Especially with inflation. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:20:23
Guess he told you. lol, what a n00b he was. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:28:31
Ahh, this makes more sense. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:57:50
Blockchainmail, only thing better is scalemail. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:11:40
Indeed. The worse thing than seeing a crappy movie is realizing you paid hard earned money for it. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 09:59:57
It seems this attack vector is gaining in popularity the last few months. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:01:18
Good thing they are handling all the GOX refunds. /s
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:18:46
Cuz they want the gainz. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:06:04
Was probably him. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:55:35
I know right. You can get a whole newspaper for 50 cents. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:39:45
I was so close, do I get a prize?
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:10:58
You’re the mark. I mean you’re the man. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:27:36
About a year too late. Could have blamed them for the Blockchain bloat if they were earlier. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:41:28
I should probably refrain also. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:00:17
It’s ok, that’s how Aussies talk to each other. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 06:00:34
Too bad you didn’t do this 5 years ago. 
@_date: 2016-04-24 21:26:09
24 word. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:12:21
So... like Catholics?
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:48:50
Both 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:43:34
Too bad Bitpay only works with a small handful of wallets these days. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:08:41
10 to 40 times increase is possible. Have you seen bitcoins history?
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:47:39
And maybe some clothes. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:58:35
Used them fine last night but it’s unavailable to me now. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 09:29:19
No thanks, those aren’t worth anything. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:23:54
You da man. Tell Josh “he sux” for me will ya?
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:27:31
You forgot that they enforce a BIP that very few wallets do. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:04:44
If it ever gets that low. 
@_date: 2018-01-01 01:15:23
Or less. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:03:38
Agree. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 07:52:49
Kinda like coindice was?
@_date: 2018-01-12 06:31:42
Nope, it’s Bitpay unfortunately. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:00:03
1100 ml. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 00:05:10
You did the right thing. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:56:10
What happens in February, stays in February. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 03:25:48
Only if you get them to pee in it first. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:38:40
Works either way. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:22:43
Hear hear. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 07:00:13
I’ve seen it’s whole history. 
@_date: 2018-01-14 09:09:42
Used to be called a tithe. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:31:55
I spent only bitcoins a few times a week at a local eatery for a year or so, a few years ago. Could’ve, would’ve, should’ve held if only I had a crystal ball. 
@_date: 2019-07-24 22:37:03
I had to buy one too.
@_date: 2018-01-16 07:38:20
Haha. Nice one. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:57:17
But he didn’t have the crystal ball?
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:25:46
Or 2012 or 2013
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:35:19
I spent years educating people, why can't people educate themselves like I did?
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:02:50
@_date: 2018-01-30 09:57:23
Good story, so how much did you get from him?
@_date: 2018-01-12 02:37:45
I bet if coinbase had a coinbasecoin, they would pump that shit like Ver on a BCash. 
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:09:19
I have none. Do some  reading.
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:41:29
You do it your way, they’ll do it their way. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:20:07
Back then it was a currency, now it’s a store of value. Times change. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:22:59
And forgot his PIN. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:56:50
Wish I was in the 21 club. Was there early enough but I couldn’t read the future :(
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:28:29
Seriously cool mug.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:14:29
If I found your lost Trezor, I would have 16 chances to guess your PIN before it gets wiped. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:45:49
You can use Electrum with your Trezor, so that’s a big plus right there. I heard armory hasn’t been supported in some time by any developers. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:20:05
Does for me, but I prefer the Chrome Extension. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 07:42:24
The new fork Bitcoin Penis. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 23:19:34
Definitely not normal. You should take up this issue with GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:45:52
There were a lot of us slain by the Gox. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:59:49
Take that new redditors. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:56:55
You know a lot of people who have never smoked get cancer right?
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:51:09
All be bock. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:46:36
Mmmm.... cookie. Good analogy btw. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:10:47
It’s true. 
@_date: 2019-07-14 06:28:02
Sadly, most people don't.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:38:33
It’s obviously a joke, the seed is invalid. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:14:42
True that. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:54:05
Price prediction based on nothing: $20,000.00 by end of this year, $200,000.00 by end of next year. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:42:30
Most likely a threshold. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:19:54
Not clamoring for 2x because that was never on the table. They were clamoring for segwit2x. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 01:00:32
You forgot the part where they keep rebroadcasting those tx’s beyond the two week default. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:13:04
Easy peasy, the sheeple will follow. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:26:48
Quit giving them ideas. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:23:19
Got stats on how many non smokers have cancer and how many smokers?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:58:40
Your just lucky you weren’t taking that class during the lulls of 2014-2015. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:12:38
Everyday. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:07:58
Amen brother. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:21:36
Mmmm... four lambos, one for every season. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:13:16
The way it’s always been. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:03:33
Over a month ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:56:32
True, OP should suck the BCH and BTG out of those keys before sending them. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:25:45
Sorry, I thought you liked being informed. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:26:08
Thanks for the ponzi. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:07:09
You don’t think an attack could cause this? You must be new, bitcoin has had many attacks. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:20:51
lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:09:42
You can buy Trezor directly from their website with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:07:27
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:14:45
Scary if people actually thought this is a good implementation. Be more worried about “ who else has my keys”. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:02:45
So if altcoins had the same volume it would be the same situation with those too?
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:46:12
I like your enthusiasm. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:53:14
Trezor has a coin recovery tool for just your situation. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:49:01
I suppose if it’s not useful, it won’t get much use. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:13:38
I like this analogy. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:17:53
Cheap labour. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:06
Glad I didn’t call them morons, yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 09:07:36
Isn’t that what just happened?
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:22:21
Looks like you used really low fee, might take a long time if ever. 
@_date: 2019-07-24 18:25:59
I feel the same despair from that last sentence.
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:16:17
Hodlers had control??
@_date: 2018-09-24 06:59:29
Way of the road Bub's, way of the road. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:25:44
Scary. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:01:10
At least it’s obvious in the tickers BTC, BCH, BTG...
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:55:52
Welcome to the social experiment. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:43:08
Damn, you guys guessed my mnemonic. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 06:15:50
Says you. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:29:14
New world order boiii!
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:14:05
Not this time?
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:02:09
That’s to throw off the rainbow table. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:34:39
I think we all are. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:41:46
*didn’t have the majority hash power. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:54:36
Fuck that, let’s prove me wrong and go much higher. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:22:33
It’s not malicious to pump your own coin and dump on the competition. 
@_date: 2018-09-08 07:11:04
Not *at all.
@_date: 2018-09-12 22:32:02
Welcome to the internet new user. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:38:37
Do they mean this year, Or next?
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:00:11
Be safe from the gifter at least. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:59:17
They’re easier to spend from. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:39:50
At least it can’t get any lower than that. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:17:36
Pretty much same as argument against 6 digit today. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:50:23
Indeed. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:14:39
Lead is pretty resistant to the elements and not even supergirl could read it.
@_date: 2018-09-19 05:01:25
Very. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:03:20
Ditto. 
@_date: 2018-09-10 23:45:16
It's pretty much just one person being the "miserable twat" about NAFTA. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:39:41
Yes 
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:59:00
Definitely not as cool, but still pretty cool nonetheless. I just found some a few months ago in BTC-E, and in an old Cavirtex account which became Kraken unfortunately, but still got my 0.0983. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:11:09
You know it. First MtGox “crash” went from $30 down to $2, next was $1200 down to $300. This correction is peanuts. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 05:57:57
Because ponzi schemes always go bust quickly?
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:21:41
Except CSW?
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:15:42
Seems like a trend. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:20:26
Are you sleeping again?
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:50:56
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:04:29
Year isn’t over yet. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:46:18
And how many places can I use this digibyte?
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:02:50
Reusing addresses is not only bad for your privacy, but also for everyone else you transacted with. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:07:28
Sorry to hear of your unfortunate poor timing, story of my life. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:01:38
Or just crazy which makes him unpopular?
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:35:29
Pretty sure the mainstream population began talking interest because of the huge price increase in the last couple months, not because of the underlying technology. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 02:47:42
Who doesn’t?
@_date: 2018-09-24 06:44:48
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 03:31:41
Well said.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 08:33:50
How are you going to organize all these topics in one thread? Need a sub for that. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:40:57
Ok, I don’t want to get political here, look at some latest media and decided yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:28:04
“social engineering attack”
I like this better than my “propaganda attack”. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:38:21
They batch transactions, you won’t see anything on the Blockchain until they actually send it. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 06:48:15
That's usually how these things play out. Gotta make the post to make the marks think you got scammed instead of them. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:33:01
Propaganda attack. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 09:00:54
I always thought it was a social experiment. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:32:45
Was it Super Troopers?
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:02:36
Ditto. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 07:01:52
Best would be FIDO U2F. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 15:23:54
number 1 tech magazine world wide makes newbie mistake,  news at 11. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:34:50
It’s funny but it’s true, or is that, because it’s true?
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:40:58
Better KYC and AML yourself then. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 06:08:30
"Why not just add up the block transactions at the value when they occurred?"
Maybe people aren't smart enough to calculate the true value of throughput. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:00:59
November. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:52:49
You are actually giving a much better gift that will most likely be appreciated this time. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 02:15:34
Goddamnit now I want a lambo lotus house. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 06:24:55
Indeed. 
@_date: 2018-09-11 23:06:33
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:40:50
It was a schoolyard smash?
@_date: 2018-09-11 23:08:16
Maybe. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:55:26
Elbows ice, breaks elbow, drowns. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:33:38
Figured. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:04:18
Too low. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:07:25
And I fucking missed it again. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:05:25
Hodl LTC? Wish I did. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:19:07
They created them as an attempt to make their customers whole after they were “hacked”. The TOS says there is no guarantee they will honor dollar for tether though. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:04:20
That’s S2X talk. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 22:37:20
I like this person ^
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:29:10
If $178 loss puts you on the street, maybe you shouldn’t be investing. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:00:39
Same as the one which shouldn’t be mentioned. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:11:11
Wise words. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:59:43
It’s still early. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:13:37
That’s a pretty hefty fee, shouldn’t take too much longer. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:51:32
You were correct.

Well said.

It will also store all three of your coins at once.

You broke the cardinal rule, don’t invest more than you’re willing to lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:54:13
Or they could simply use the coin recovery tool that Trezor made for this exact purpose. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 10:12:41
Something you have, something your neighbor has, and something your grandmother has. If you split up the keys?
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:07:43
Sent as BTC of course. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:29:35
It’s only been available for a year in litecoin and a few months in bitcoin. Seems nobody wants to benefit from it. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:44:31
Just a dude, not a genie.

Too late.

Awww. The poor little doggy. This might be the saddest cartoon I have ever seen.

Why were they clamoring for segwit2x then?

Where have you been the last few decades?
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:37:57
Is that what Mark is planning? Makes me happier that I don’t use Facebook. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 01:47:33
They were mostly other peoples coins. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 07:01:57
Like my boss just suggested the other day, would have lost a grand a coin by today if I took his advice.

This isn’t learning. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:20:36
Jesus, did this even need to be stated? Hopefully most know this. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:35:28
I thought so too. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:12:57
Finally. Someone who knows a wallet is not a single key pair. 
@_date: 2015-12-02 01:48:59
BFL actually made a product, unlike GAW. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:46:41
The point is they haven’t been using it. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 10:31:58
2096? Them goin be some old mofos. 
@_date: 2018-09-05 19:57:49
They were accessible to the person who used your mnemonic and are now accessible to them at their own wallet. You should have also used a passphrase as per BIP39 standard. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:43:59
Nailed it. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:42:39
Did they get their tax cuts yet? Or was it only for the rich people?
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:28:32
Apparently they didn’t. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 07:09:32
Weird  why people would do such a thing. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 10:25:44
Why wouldn't people know this by now. It's not really new news. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 17:07:25
I didn't know that. Thanks for the info. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:47:26
I wouldn’t. Would mean adoption is stagnating. 
@_date: 2015-12-07 10:08:30
I don't think it was magic but rather thoughtfulness. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:06:09
You know it. 
@_date: 2018-09-24 06:22:31
"I'm not sure why Trezor even gives you the option to enter the seed phrase through the computer, but unfortunately they do"
They ask in random order when entering through computer so is very safe. How much is !24?

This side thread wasn’t about technology.

I just used one click yesterday on Amazon. What is illegal?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:34:05
Look it up. Plenty of articles about bitfinex hack and what they did about it. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 19:00:18
Trezor obviously.

Nothing has been returned to any creditors yet. 
@_date: 2018-09-14 21:28:05
Looks cool but I wouldn't call it a blockchain phone,  more like a smartphone with hardware wallet integration. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:57:43
They sure do.  Check out Site C. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:37:40
That opening was the best. 
The shnozberries taste like shnozberries. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:31:38
Drum up hype that their wallet has a broken RNG ?
@_date: 2015-12-13 10:16:14
Could be a Shatner comma. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:39:30
... and a currency. 
@_date: 2015-12-25 18:59:40
That's why you ask Santa for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:12:35
It was obvious, which is why I informed you.

I always thought BCC was the ticker for BitConnect. 
@_date: 2018-08-18 06:25:01
How much herion are we talking? My car idles cheap. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:56:25
So they had to change it to BCH because BCC was already being used?
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:24:14
I like how this genius kid helps the community by finding security holes and helps to fix them. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:57:13
Obviously, but two scams can’t have the same ticker. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 09:04:05

Although it was written, but it will be done.

Can always happen.

When a customer did that to me, I simply told them next time it’s triple the hourly cost. They actually came back a couple years later for more work.

Thanks for the answer, I agree they were very rushed trying to get ahead of the UASF, but you would think they would check availability of tickers. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:06:02
In my case they were present for all the hours worked, but still couldn’t add it up. The second time they complained as well, so I told them it would be double next time. Haven’t seen them again. You have to make difficult customers either not want to come back or make it worth my effort. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 17:28:33

Not for bitmex.

Considering that they mined with that equipment for 2 months before the fire, they most likely made their money back on the equipment investment.

I didn’t mean to imply you that you were a difficult customer, just giving my experience from the other side. Boat work is expensive, boat is an acronym for Bring Out Another Thousand.

You should have known BIP32 does not have 11 word seeds. 12, 15, 18, and 24 only. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 07:40:19
Because of maths. There are too many and not enough computational power.

If everything cost 25% more in USD, then so would bitcoin. I don't see people wanting to convert unless they thought USD would continue to devalue.

@_date: 2014-12-16 06:43:15
I was more meaning the malware could intercept the privkey when you spend it (online).

Never used paper and probably never will. I use bitcoin qt on my windows pc and blockchain.info app on my iphone5. 
@_date: 2014-10-19 01:05:49
You should have written down the seed when you first set it up. It gives you many warnings to do so. The seed cannot be extracted from the device which is why people use it. Super secure. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 22:41:34

There is much information on the Trezor website about restoring seeds, but personally I would load the words into one of my other Trezor devices.

An address is not a wallet! A wallet should give new address for every tx if it is working properly. Seems many people don't know this and that is very unfortunate for them and the rest of us users.

Why would somebody sell their hashing power for less than what it could earn for themselves. Mining contracts don't make sense to me.

And a fractional reserve is good because?
@_date: 2014-02-11 02:37:03
Bitcoin mining cannot be done with video cards profitably unless you have free electricity. You need to look at ASIC machines
@_date: 2017-02-28 09:14:26
You are correct, they're talking about wallet services and not wallets in general. Nobody can stop a tx into your own address. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:13:45
" The more you know "
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:06:35

@_date: 2017-02-27 06:53:08
It's 24 words and you don't need an internet connection to retrieve the wallet in case of lost or damaged Trezor. 
@_date: 2014-11-03 08:57:03
Go with newegg. Tiger direct use to be good in the past, but have gone way downhill over the last year. They have owed me a refund for over 4 months, horrible customer service if you can get a reply and when they do reply it is lies that they try to apologize for the previous lies and they lie again. This is still an ongoing issue, I still have not received my refund for a cancelled item that was going to take over a month to deliver after it said in stock when I ordered it. 
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:36:34
Wtf? I just answered your question and now I have a goofy agenda? Sweet!

You get a discount on your Trezor if you mine on his pool.

Because it's pocket change for the multibillionaire  
@_date: 2015-01-16 07:57:28
Yes. Case in point, I took my Trezor to my buddies place and used his God-knows-what's-infected computer to buy him a game key.

You don't need to open the device, just make a malicious clone of it. Open source hardware and software afterall, just introduce your own malware into the code and bam, bob's your uncle.

"Leaked out over a long period" there are records of every transaction I did on the exchange, so there should be records of every transaction by every other member as well. Shouldn't be too difficult to see where they went.

@_date: 2017-02-27 07:14:13
The first ones gave the option of 12 or 24 words. Pretty sure newer firmware versions only allow 24 (safer). The device only generates keys and signs transactions it does not store details of accounts, this is what the interfacing software does. 
@_date: 2016-01-22 09:05:55
That's how we did it in the 90's. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 07:43:37
I have opened one of the many trezors I have very carefully with a razor knife from the opposite end from the hologram, and resealed it, looks flawless. Putting a hologram at each seam may solve this.

Whoa! Are you saying we should all control our own private keys?
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:20:59
You are going to get the private keys to control by implementing your own wallet, example: install your own local wallet software. 
@_date: 2016-01-23 11:48:22
Got one today.

@_date: 2019-06-14 06:03:16
Same way as buying from an exchange, you send it to an address in your wallet.
@_date: 2019-02-06 08:53:16
Experiments are good, it's how we learn. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 08:36:54


Only if they are poor. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:14:11
Damnit, they found my house. Lights for weed is more profitable these days. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:55:37
Get him!
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:39:27
Called QR. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:07:24
Guessing it’ll be both. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:33:50
After you wipe device and then restore with the seed, you need to enable passphrase protection again.  
@_date: 2019-06-14 18:19:02
Wallets are free and very easy to use, you can get one for any platform.
@_date: 2019-02-06 11:38:16
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:23:59
Best quote.
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:24:11
The mistake is you used wrong seed. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:05:42
Pretty sure it makes fun of bitcoin gold price compared to bitcoin price. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:12:20
So like couple more months then?
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:44:47
Sell to re enter in a few days at a higher price?
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:42:40
Hell no. Cash is always always anonymous. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 08:46:15
We already have satellite node. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 02:03:12
It is easier to use, maybe not easier to secure. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:36:07
I don’t know what that is from my mobile. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:16:37
They never promised to pay dollar for tether. So yeah, backed by nothing. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:55:12
Restore with seed. 
@_date: 2019-06-19 06:31:39
@_date: 2017-11-18 08:57:16
Already is in CAD. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:50:19
Those were the days. 
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:35:24
Every 10% dip? Jesus, so you're buying multiple times per day?
@_date: 2017-11-01 08:03:01
Not in North America. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:25:57
I don’t know why you were downvoted, everything you wrote is correct. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 00:19:39
Best to not put them in digital form at all. Could have been lost to hackers. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:18:56
You don’t pay, you don’t drink, you die. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:14:35
The cool thing was that he wasn’t converting them to fiat. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:52:16
Same shit different pile. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 08:57:35
"If you look after it yourself, nobody can steal it from you"
But they can and have, this is the reason why Marek created Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:19:49
No. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:40:17
Wait a few more months and get both. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:36:16
Take off eh. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:12:30
The garage is in the back with the city Tesla. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:38:31
Go run it then. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:52:20
Then feel bad when it hits $1M. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:27:34
That’s what I would do. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:44:05
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:55:53
/me puts hand down 
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:02:55
Thank you for that amazing summary. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:39:12
/me raises hand 
@_date: 2015-08-13 09:10:46
Nice grouping. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:19:31
A flawed one apparently. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:54:28
Why would you use a bank machine if you want to remain anonymous?  
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:36:24
... and then they lose them shortly thereafter. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 07:50:03
I like your secure element. ;)
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:08:14
Only if you want them to think about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:12:14
Still do, who do you trust?
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:25:50
Now that’s some good advice. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:47:03
Sold at $10. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:30:09
Unfortunately not many were aware of this fact. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:32:35
Looks like an antminer. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 03:02:56
We've been hardened. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:39:37
Have you heard about bitcoin gold?
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:21:23
Mmmm... piece of steak. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:51:46
A rising toilet bowl lifts all turds. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:18:11
Newbs gunna n00b. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:05:46
The long con. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 01:35:04
But Bitcoin is doing great, in my opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:53:52
I heard about it on CBC radio in 2011 when it crashed from ATH of $30 to pennies, which was caused by a theft of half million coins from a user in mtgox. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:26:54
You used the wrong seed and/or passphrase. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:29:14
Diamond is less of a thing than S2X was. There is no Blockchain for it yet. 
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:26:12
:P is for Pussy.
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:36:23
Couldn’t afford 20 bux for a couple bitcoins? Hope you’re doing better these days. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:27:38
Should have used the s. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:38:37
lol 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:13:27
Holy sleuthing Batman! Every company needs to hire you. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 06:42:45
I get it, cause you wouldn’t know the news if your dad didn’t tell you about it. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:22:36
You should diversify. 
@_date: 2019-02-16 21:13:03
*Canada 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:10:43
They just didn’t know because they didn’t research. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:49:46
Wow, good deal. Do you think I need it?  
@_date: 2019-02-13 17:53:04
In the ignition. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:54:01
How long in your opinion till number two?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:58:47
That exploit was fixed a few firmware updates ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:00:46
Neibour deserved it. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:26:52
I’ll give you two persimmons for that. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:11:44
Tween girls do, that’s who. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:28:58
Wrong passphrase then?
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:27:38
Gotta like a guy who knows where his balls are at. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:37:01
You’re aiming too low. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:58:07
Lol, it's a node. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:04:27
Adding more fractions equals splitting in your world?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:42:19
I think it’s called comedy cash, or Ccash for short. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:33:49
Also a premium for an unadulterated cassascius coin. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:29:13
Two weeks. 
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:41:54
Or they're mostly sockpuppets.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:04:48
You’re aiming too low. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:21:36
It’s FUD. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:35:27
I must have bought over a hundred sandwiches directly with bitcoin over the years. That restaurant owner has most of my bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:10:51
Some people don’t know how to wager. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:49:42
Have two. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:32:40
Yes, you are right. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 19:24:15
They should have years ago, but they created tether to make their customers "whole" after their largest "hack". Now they can just print their own money willey nilley as they see fit. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 13:57:04
And things have been decomposing every day since the beginning of death. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:38:25
It’s funny because it’s true. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:19:50
Worked for me. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 03:01:28
Sounds like a popular token. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 08:27:43
The days of innocence and youth. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:06:37
Maybe it’s something called price discrimination. Here is a recent article —&gt; 
@_date: 2019-02-09 07:42:09
With Trezor, you can use with your android phone on the go. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:05:16
It’s only hard if you’re poor. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:31:17
Let’s get this ponzi started, we’re only 0.009 % of the way there. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:23:46
Same reason you don’t. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:17:55
Back in the days when everyone could mine. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:57:21
Ledger is not open source, but Trezor is. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:07:12
Till he shits it out. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:52:14
I know right?
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:56:33
What you are calling a password is actually the passphrase. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:17:53
Tennis ball. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 07:31:51
Was done years ago by someone on bitcointalk. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:31:57
You do. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 08:59:20
Or at least a little bit of blood. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 08:30:17
Only the one from better call Saul. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:17:15
People have watched worse willingly. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:23:37


Exactly. 
@_date: 2015-07-11 00:33:27
...and cheaper nowadays.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:47:01
I lol’d
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:35:16
There’s a market for those things?
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:58:36
Thought it was dollaringos. 
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:06:24
50 inch tv
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:44:35
Spoke too soon?
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:07:18
You mean still. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:46:39
This guy sees. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 17:56:31
Bitcoin core was suitable for my first wallet, from 2011 until Trezor was released. 
@_date: 2015-07-21 06:59:45
I've had bitcoin saved on my windows machine since 2011, I don't see the problem. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:37:57
That’s some bitcoin gold right there. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:23:10
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 06:15:47
Ok, but I can’t verify everything in your device?
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:58:18
I always sell when I’m high.
 Edit: which is why I try not to get high too often. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:56:45
Man!... I want a three yacht garage. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:30:27
Jeezuz, that’s some damn good advice. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:53:17
That makes more sense. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:12:48
Which exchanges could I use for this?
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:35:29
Self made. 
@_date: 2015-07-15 22:26:10
I think this is the normal use case for double spend
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:11:04
I believe everyone is capable. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:11:06
Tesla roof tiles. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 03:25:38
But they never said they would pay back 1 to 1. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:09:43
You have a babysitter? How old are you??
@_date: 2017-11-11 05:37:30
But you learned your lesson right?
@_date: 2019-04-30 04:17:33
Unfortunately, most people don't want to read anymore.
@_date: 2019-04-30 19:32:39
@_date: 2019-04-15 19:28:26
But there will only ever be 21 million. if I had 2 million of them would that scare you or the masses? Doesn't make sense to me.
@_date: 2016-02-15 20:49:43
Elaborate please. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 08:40:40
Insurance?? Lol. 
@_date: 2019-04-18 20:03:43
Maybe for that extra 2 percent. Greedy people are greedy.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:00:54
Kinda like 10,000BTC for a couple pizzas. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 08:15:51
Everybody wang chun tonite. 
@_date: 2019-04-15 19:30:08
Supply is known.
@_date: 2017-04-10 06:24:24
*pounds. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:38:02
I always thought it was called transaction fee. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:46:25
Tell that to Trump. 
@_date: 2017-04-07 22:02:51
This is my experience and feeling also. 
@_date: 2016-02-26 06:57:02
Rawr. 
@_date: 2017-04-27 22:49:48
Costumers are people who wear costumes?
@_date: 2017-04-04 06:23:19
That's how they are able to pay them back. 
@_date: 2019-04-15 18:55:09
How would satoshi coins moving tank the value of bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-02-15 08:46:23
Trezor is safer. 
@_date: 2016-02-28 14:45:30
Is this redundant system not hardware?
@_date: 2019-04-30 20:01:13
Ah yes, the fall guy. not the real owner.
@_date: 2016-02-11 21:40:02
Just got email from blockchain.info about a log in attempt from 92.46.10.201 (Kazakhstan), I'm in Canada. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:54:03
Is it worth anything?
@_date: 2016-02-11 20:39:29
... and trezor works with Android OTG. 
@_date: 2019-04-30 21:04:35
In Canada, most BTM's don't require any form of identification.
@_date: 2016-02-15 08:53:15
Less easy/safe when spending. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 22:33:41
Trezor is easier and safer to spend from than paper wallets. There, I educated you. 
@_date: 2019-04-26 19:39:14
There are no GPU's in that picture.
@_date: 2019-04-11 21:06:55
People who only understand terms an autistic 5 year old would, should not be buying cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2019-04-21 14:55:52
Bitcoin Core was the first wallet I ever used. Didn't seem too difficult.
@_date: 2016-09-01 09:00:54
Never keep money in an exchange unless you are actively trading. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:18:34
Be more profitable to grow weed in them pods. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:30:52
Sounds about right, doesn't take a lot of electricity to produce a gram of weed. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 02:16:40
It's a good investment if you only put in money that you would have gambled, smoked, drank, or otherwise pissed away. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:28:49
My Google translate didn't work for this one. Does anyone know what they mean?
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:48:42
I'd buy that for a dollar. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:54:09
Dodgy, the knife salesman. Found a better moniker. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 03:17:58
'Bout as cool as shooting a Tesla into space. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:56:20
Jesus! Have we reached peak already?
@_date: 2018-11-11 05:40:52
I heard the segment at work and when I got home I researched it, haven't stopped yet. This rabbit hole goes deep. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:12:52
You are awesome. 
@_date: 2018-11-17 02:45:18
That's why we took the boat indeed. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:23:23
7,000, no 42,000. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 03:19:29
I'll offer half an SV. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 07:01:48
Happens to us all. 
@_date: 2018-11-01 07:33:08
His socks. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 07:54:45
Is it just me, or does that zoomed out picture look like an evil demon face?
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:54:41
Cuz u a gambler. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:56:18
Way to invest more than you could afford to lose. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:41:01
Do you mean like Tetla? I don't think it'll work. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 05:47:52
State sponsored hacker terrorists? NSA agents?
@_date: 2018-11-18 08:43:59
Pretty much. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 07:44:35
...and less security. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 00:39:29
Must be a really good bot because the lack of punctuation makes it look human. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:15:56
Tried that after it crossed the 200 mark a few years ago, didn't work out for me. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 00:44:13
I've bought many items from tigerdirect and newegg among other vendors including restaurants in my town for years,with bitcoin directly. 
@_date: 2016-09-07 21:21:42
But can it launder my money?
@_date: 2018-03-28 20:52:29
I bought stuff from them years ago with bitcoin in Canada, is this news?
@_date: 2018-03-24 00:16:59
It’s like he’s too smart to be a human, maybe he’s a space alien from an advanced civilization. 
@_date: 2018-11-15 03:13:43
Probably runs with the bulls too. 
@_date: 2018-11-11 05:33:57
I heard about it in July 2011 on CBC radio. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:39:35
Welcome to the mining game. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 07:36:06
Copper apparently. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:30:18
Ain't nuthin wrong with blown-out hookers. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:29:11
It's the black Friday sale. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 09:49:03
And I can not lie. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:25:20
I likened it to Vista or Millennium in terms of stability. UI wise it’s a tablet OS. 98SE, XP, and 7 have been their best. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 00:42:34
I took your advice, but I don't agree with your prediction. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 03:17:03
Tethered, lol. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:27:54
Needed the /s, I thought you were serious. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 00:19:42
Good points. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:36:09
Works for me. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:41:30
He did it because he’s always wanted a slush signed Barney?
@_date: 2018-03-28 21:31:17
Only a loser if can’t find the bigger fool. 
@_date: 2016-09-22 07:40:41
No. and not just because iPhone doesn't support Trezor. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 07:29:34
Yup. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 20:20:33
I just did a TX with 1sat/byte fee last night, was included in next block. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:45:11
Until a week later after you printed them they are worth 3 times the price. 
@_date: 2019-01-03 01:18:52
Hey, that's cool, I learn new stuff everyday too. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 00:42:08
Main reason why Trezor is better. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:36:35
This is it, gentlemen, minus the it and the comma. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 03:15:10
Urban legend, back then it would be like 2 cents. 
@_date: 2018-03-17 17:13:54
Patriot act happened. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 00:56:32
Australia, that explains it. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:03:37
Haha, good one. I think it’s more about being able to do microtransactions for next to nothing fees. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 07:49:56
“They” were misleading. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 22:54:12
You mean store the seed. Passphrase is something completely different. 
@_date: 2016-09-13 21:38:44
Good points. Thanks for the reply. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:08:22
Same if you hold it yourself? I guess I just don't understand people. 
@_date: 2019-01-22 06:00:52
At least you weren't one of the people waiting "two weeks" for over a year. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:55:33
@_date: 2019-01-12 07:45:20
Yes, the dearly departed. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 07:27:48
Sure hope you're not right. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 21:23:41
How is having it in coinbase going to "help it grow"? Do they pay interest or something?
@_date: 2019-01-13 06:51:16
That's a good one but nobody could enforce the decree. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 23:50:04
Because it's the future!
@_date: 2019-01-01 09:42:36
It's its own birth. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 19:01:31
I lol'd at Gilbert Gottfried. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:52:42
Because reasons. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 18:54:28
Because fertilizer is useful?
@_date: 2018-03-31 01:26:08
You’re not a bitcoin miner. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 06:46:06
But a lot of the people that live it, feel it's fair. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 06:59:56
War, what is it good for?
@_date: 2019-01-24 07:24:46
Litecoins be like the change in your coin purse,  bitcoin be like the dolla dolla bills yo. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 02:20:12
Naw... it's the Brexit thing. Either that or because everything commodity-wise is dropping. Have you heard Canadian oil is $14.00 per barrel?
@_date: 2019-01-10 03:49:44
That guy is gunna want a fee, I'll do it for free. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 07:57:47
Yes,  invest all your worth. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 09:57:22
Asking the real questions. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 03:29:53
At least I was accurate. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:18:23
If? Do you research?
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:03:02
It used to years ago. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 07:01:46
Yes, and a 10% income tax would be pretty reasonable too. 
@_date: 2019-01-02 20:14:14
You can trust them to create tether out of thin air to make their customers "whole" after their largest hack a few years ago. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 01:45:25
Trezor works great on my android phone with beta-wallet.trezor.io with chrome browser. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:10:29
@_date: 2019-01-24 05:36:05
Good points.

Text em over, I'll decipher them for you.

Mtgox 2.0

Probably meant to donate .02
@_date: 2019-01-13 08:44:19
Do you mean first one or last one?
@_date: 2019-01-12 07:59:13
But everyone can remember "correct horse battery staple"  
@_date: 2019-01-24 06:51:45
LOL, what planet do you live on? Cuz I want to live there too. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 06:41:13
Ideally there would be no need for armies. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 04:26:28
I know I can't. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 23:46:37
My first thought. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 07:39:37
@_date: 2019-01-06 08:02:20
Open your eyes. 
@_date: 2016-09-23 05:49:13
With bacon bits. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 08:03:00
How many stablecoins do we need?
@_date: 2019-01-02 23:11:52
Ohh, helping coinbase grow. I thought they meant helping their crypto grow. 
@_date: 2019-01-26 04:25:40
Looks scrumptious. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:22:11
Sounds like true love. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 22:48:20
Whether you wear a sweater or not, depends on the weather.

Rich peoples offshore bank accounts. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 18:43:24
Excellent summary in layman's terms. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 22:42:24
This is what I was thinking, we already have those, even fractions of them too 0.25, 0.10, 0.05
@_date: 2019-01-10 02:28:34
You missed a 0. 
@_date: 2016-09-13 06:46:13
How can satoshidice benefit from payment channels? I thought Bitcoin was the payment channel.  
@_date: 2019-01-12 07:52:26
Recommend doesn't seem like a strong enough word. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:27:24
Didn’t he create LTC ?
@_date: 2018-03-04 11:38:57
I upvoted you, fork over the doge. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:06:28
Welcome to earth. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:07:38
Is that going to be more useful than liquid sidechain?
@_date: 2017-09-05 06:18:25
Ya, seems pretty low. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 16:37:23
Hate when that happens. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 06:50:20
They can still afford hats and neckties, so they still holding.

Pretty sure replying to person who upped their cc limit to 10k. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:26:08
Yes, better to gamble with money you already have than to borrow with interest. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:28:18
The answer is: do it. Please 
Edit: politeness. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 07:25:29
You would help him shave his coinpurse too, wouldn't you?
@_date: 2018-03-13 04:31:26
Seriously? Green mouth, blue eyes, nobody else sees this?
@_date: 2018-11-25 07:51:21
Well, this whole experiment is still in beta after all. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:42:14
You could eBay that slush signed Barney for at least 300, instant profit. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 07:38:17
"There is no currency or payment method that will buy you a coffee in any random coffee shop in the world."
Wait! No coffee shop in the world will accept any currency or payment method? That's weird because I just used a payment method the other day, and a currency the day before. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:10:34
Dumbasses gunna dumbass.  
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:29:50
Which one would you choose to run?
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:49:23
Wish I was that guy. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 09:44:38
*Tandy voice
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:33:53
Sounds dreamy. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:03:55
I would because I ain't got much to start with. Them's pretty good odds. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:50:35
Easy as that. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 22:06:02
Not many ways to educate a retarded dog, either love it or put it down.

3 bux. No 12k. Somewhere in between these values or outside. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:13:09
And past. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 00:22:54
You forgot the /s.

You don’t need any funds in the wallet to run the client as a node. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:23:51

@_date: 2018-11-25 07:31:14
200,000. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 15:11:29
Was that the same with UASF?
@_date: 2018-11-16 02:30:15
Antarctica is the safe haven. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:17:45
It won’t even happen 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:31:35
This made me actually lol. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:04:41
Didn't say that, but many people would not be able to tell the difference. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:02:42
Indeed, should have bought at the last 300. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 22:06:00
/me raises hand.

Copy paste concept, demand will follow.

Way to math poindexter
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:14:40
Yes.

Anyone with hearing.

Real life utility for a few weeks at most, bananas don’t really work as an analogy. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:46:56
Two weeks! And another in a month or so. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:30:53
Did if you bought no name brands. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:17:32
...Alex. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:22:07
Someone didn’t even try to research. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:17:57
They need a better programmed bot then. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:21:13
4, no 17.  
@_date: 2018-11-16 01:25:53
Someone's been under a rock. Better set aside a couple hours and do some reading. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:49:52
While that’s mostly true, I got nothing else. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:41:12
He’s my brother.  
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:41:58
Yes, a helpful chat bot is what all companies need. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:18:30
Except not many wallets support segwit yet. 
@_date: 2018-03-10 12:29:33
Kinda like the Tether of the crypto community?
@_date: 2017-09-20 21:16:03
Properly programmed chat bots can be just as helpful and less emotional than real humans, and wayyyy cheaper 24/7.  And you would not be able to tell the difference. 
@_date: 2017-10-23 07:49:01
RIP in pieces. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:07:32
Me too. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:24:13
Good advice. 
@_date: 2017-09-24 07:31:45
Some people know a little bit and fewer know all. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 03:32:15
Goo goo g'joob, indeed. 
@_date: 2017-09-21 07:15:08
@_date: 2017-09-20 20:00:37
Nice add. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:30:22
I only need cash for hookers and drugs. Use debit/credit for everything else. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:31:52
Good one. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:03:42
Should have told them it was for drugs on Silk Road. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 06:51:08
Dude! You guys are so far ahead of us in Canada. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:50:52
Winning. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:43:20
No one needs to listen,yet you post it for all to listen. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:12:40
Best bet, welcome to the experiment. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:52:17
It probably won’t even happen anyway. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 08:32:19
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:12:20
The way the forks are flying around, soon to be fork day. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 06:02:59
Tell them they’re not going to live forever and they can’t take it with them. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:36:28
Aww... so sweet. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 19:52:33
So, because everyone decided to use zero fee then they would mine empty blocks for spite? On the other side, two weeks. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 06:58:44
I thought it was every second. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:29:03
This really speaks to the people. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 20:41:23
Free transactions was lost a few updates ago when bitcoin-days-destroyed meant something.

Are you on mushrooms, or am I on mushrooms?

Lobbing out dick loogies. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 06:57:26
Couple days to be posted means couple days till recipient can spend funds, bitcoin wins. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 08:19:12
So you have a real job then?
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:25:31
Most bitcoin debit card services have unusually high fees. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:10:36
This is something you should have looked into before buying it, but many software wallets support Trezor seed. 
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:00:32
Username does not check out. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:42:12
Yeah, how come I didn’t get one?

You and me both. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:10:01
This is always how it worked for me in the past. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:16:46
At least it wasn’t Valiant. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:01:21
I don't believe $10,000 is going to ruin this persons life. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 07:14:21
You gave em away. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 05:58:49
You know it!
@_date: 2017-10-16 09:29:56
Their reply was in relation to frankreddit5 question about Trezor. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:45:48
They clearly tell you to remove your coins prior to the split so you can split them yourself. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 06:59:26
... are soon partying. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 06:48:25
Never heard of the bitpay visa debit, how are the fees?
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:40:45
Love it. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 07:04:20
Oh no you di’nt
@_date: 2017-10-13 19:39:25
So they’re just a wallet then?
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:06:48
Your last sentence and I would add, start researching more and learn. 
@_date: 2017-09-20 19:19:43
I like this analogy. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:55:51
Most likely it won’t even happen. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:51:49
I don’t see how lost bitcoin is going to be a problem, means the remaining are worth more. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 07:26:05
Because we sold it all at the ATH of $30.00
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:08:59
Hateful bunch they are. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:30:44
I’m intrigued, do tell. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 06:45:44
But it takes one to three days to receive it. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:25:19
They forgot the s

Depends if you care about open source.

@_date: 2017-10-16 09:12:59
Passphrase and PIN are two completely different things, you should probably read the documentation. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 07:11:13
It's way faster to use Facebook in the browser than that crappy app. 
@_date: 2017-09-25 07:09:40
Dude! I want an iPhone with those teeny gears and no chemical reactions. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:13:51
I like it the other way around. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:55:14
Most likely it won’t even happen. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 09:01:09
We like Will!
@_date: 2018-07-21 07:54:50
Never too late till it’s over.

@_date: 2017-10-11 00:15:15
It was only a social experiment anyways. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:37:41
You talking bout s2x?
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:32:04
So... same old, same old. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:45:17
I disagree. More fractions can be added trivially. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 07:15:40
Party money?
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:11:14
If you can afford to lose it, I say go for it. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 09:18:17
Maybe after all these years of development they never thought of this. lol

@_date: 2017-10-12 01:15:20
Bitcoin users unaffected.

Spondoolies just launched their new miner 2 days ago. The SP50 at 110 TH/s only consumes 16,570 Watts (lol only). 0.15W/GH/s seems pretty profitable at least for a few more months until everyone has that same efficiency or better.

The addresses starting with 3 (nested Segwit in a P2SH type) are definitely backwards compatible. The addresses starting bc1 (bech32 P2WPKH type) are a new Segwit only type to make addresses easier to use.

@_date: 2015-02-25 06:36:30
Can't use both?
@_date: 2015-02-09 06:07:54
What I am more interested in, is what would these companies do to benefit people?
@_date: 2015-02-25 06:26:26
2000 bit for 10 liters gas is good deal. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 07:49:07
I wasn't aware this was a contest. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 07:52:16
Should have asked if you could pay the $300 in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:02:54
Bitcoin is about making money? I thought it was supposed to replace fiat. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 20:41:23
It went mainstream? Most people I mentioned bitcoin to have never heard of it. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:35:52
You forgot the /s.
@_date: 2015-02-06 08:41:26
Cool start ups indeed, and one of the most important in Bitcoin space being Trezor. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 08:55:28
Have you even tried bacon?  I thought not. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 21:33:30
I'm interested in this answer too. Been days and it cannot sync   
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:50:50
Bankruptcy is over. They are doing civil rehabilitation now, and the amount per coin is a lot more than 400. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 09:27:36
Ten months ago we were early adopters, today we are old school veterans. 
@_date: 2015-10-15 18:09:03
History shows that this is the most likely scenario. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:09:40
This is quite the advertisement badly disguised as a random person stumbling upon a "good" Bitcoin exchange and posting about it. "Turned a profit after trading for a few hours." ??? Really?  C'mon! And "customer service was excellent" you needed to contact customer service after only a few hours?  I've been on exchanges for years and never had to contact customer service.  
@_date: 2018-12-25 03:57:57
This person knows what they are doing. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 05:55:03
How long until the update because I would be more comfortable with that than deleting my wallet app with undetermined amount of bitcoins on it. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 06:11:30
Straightforward. 
@_date: 2018-12-09 23:07:12
Your passphrase shouldn't be a word from the BIP39 word list but rather a long string of random characters you make up or a few random non-list words. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:13:18
Exactly, money goes in but never comes back. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 09:23:34
Looks centralized when you put it that way. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 10:19:45
Ok so now it is even worse than what I had. At least I had a transaction history up until it stopped syncing, but now after your advice, I have nothing.
@_date: 2015-02-21 08:44:48
Wait a year for 0.2 or sell now for 0.11. Tough choice. 
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:48:23
That should stop the bullets. 
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:58:33
Poke monsters. 
@_date: 2015-02-09 05:58:19
And shelter  
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:50:07
You were right. Took about an hour to sync, and it seems fine now. Still my favorite mobile wallet. 
@_date: 2019-05-16 20:30:30
@_date: 2018-12-19 08:25:44
Indeed, I had hundreds of bitcoins in 2012, unfortunately I spent most of them years ago. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 07:39:14
Hell yes for 5 and 7
@_date: 2018-12-26 09:00:56
Is that a problem?
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:55:53
Try telling that to trump. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:13:21
Years ago. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:38:41
Just get the Trezor, works great with android phones.
@_date: 2015-02-25 05:48:08
Long live Bush. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 06:17:50
You don't need a mining machine to run a full node. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 07:46:54
"Leaders" that follow the herd. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 01:37:05
If it gets that low again, I'll be stocking up. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:43:17
I would like this too. I only use BTC, and bits or whatever people call them is just weird. 
@_date: 2018-12-27 07:51:21
Coinbase isn't a wallet, it's an exchange. A wallet is software running on your computer, phone or hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:42:57
I get those weekly.
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:02:00
Billions 
@_date: 2018-12-26 08:45:47
Why is bitcoin on the bottom,  someone is in the wrong sub. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 07:24:19
Trezor is THE shit. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 07:44:53
Unless you're dealing with a few pennies, it's only one or two zeros after the decimal. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 10:35:03
You and the SEC gunna shut it down like all the other ponzi's?
@_date: 2019-05-27 07:40:08
Maybe ask in your altcoin sub.
@_date: 2017-06-16 06:54:06
Sending to change address is the normal function of a properly operating bitcoin wallet. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 08:04:55
Or a phrase of multiple words. 
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:57:12
Says every trader.
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:04:31
Canada,  so almost. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 06:04:04
I choose both. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 09:26:14
Indeed, sorry to get off topic, but privacy and security kinda go hand in hand. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 06:05:16
Only 78 celebrities died in 2018, not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 20:35:02
Then kick yourself when it's at 150k?
@_date: 2018-12-24 09:28:38
With urine in snow. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 09:23:55
Or they could $5 wrench you in the head and send the funds wherever they want. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 08:00:16
C'est La Vie.
@_date: 2018-12-25 06:10:17
I've been holding since last xmas, I feel fine, but I got in long before then. \m/ 
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:31:18
Maybe you should research more about how BIP32/39/44 works. Fan that little spark you got going into some big-ass flames. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:00:00
For both parties. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 00:18:43
Deceptive if you can't read numbers on the axis
@_date: 2018-12-24 23:35:49
But aren't they dumped because they are shitcoins and will become worthless sooner than later. 
@_date: 2019-05-09 01:52:48
You do know that tether was created by bitfinex to make their customers "whole" after they were hacked for many more BTC years ago right?
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:59:31
Their faq says no guarantees of repayment. 
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:30:40
Good luck dumping it. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 19:19:20
This is what I did with every bubble since 10 dollars and in between. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 09:05:23
I was hoping, that sometime in the near future, breadwallet will support Trezor BIP32/39/44 seed+passphrase to restore Trezor wallet. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 01:39:24
Yes! There's a chance of misery for everyone, except the one percent. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 08:23:21
In your first question, you are not mistaken. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:25:55
Weak hands, survival of the fittest, Darwinism...
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:26:10
I like this reply. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 06:25:19
I am sure about the ones I left there. 
@_date: 2018-12-26 09:09:32
Still reduces everyone's privacy whom you transact with. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:42:03
It's a lot more than that now with the civil rehabilitation plan. 
@_date: 2016-07-01 21:12:25
It's like buying one Starbucks coffee every day, or a third of a pack of smokes. 
@_date: 2019-05-13 09:14:04
Scary if true.
@_date: 2015-02-21 07:52:27
So a thousand bits is a couple pennies? Them's some cheap-ass bits. 
@_date: 2015-02-21 08:00:46
Amen brother. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:38:17
As far as assholes go, this one has some good points, kinda like George Carlin. 
@_date: 2019-05-09 00:41:56
This reply hasn't been upvoted enough.
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:55:23
Patriot act disagrees.
@_date: 2017-06-27 09:18:27
The whole purpose of the Trezor is that you can use it safely on the most infected machine you can find, which i have done. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 04:06:16
The bears are bullish. 
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:35:35
When it was 3 dollars, would you have thought it would get to 100 dollars?
