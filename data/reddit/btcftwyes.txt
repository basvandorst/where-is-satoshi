I first saw his interview on London real and was like man this guy is explaining BTC in a way that I could never fathom. He made me really understand what BTC really is not just money but layers and layers of application that can be built on top of BTC.

Hey op shapeshift is too high on the fees go to hit BTC . Watch the video by BTC sessions on YouTube pretty simple and you get more BTC for your cash.

When I see BCash go up 1 percent and BTC down a little. The r/BTC shills come here complaining about transaction, screw your watered down BTC you bcash shills.

Coinbase would not let me buy in the dip I’m done. Screw bcash we need more exchanges let’s turn coinbase into aol and yahoo!!! We are the users I been a coinbase customer since 2013. I never complained, but them delaying Segwit, but magically launching bcash was some low down dirty shit. Moving to bitflyer and Gemini see you there guys.

Whimcreek if you have been in crypto for two years and you practice buy and hold you will be fine. Wallstreet is something the honey badger will fight and last time I checked honey badger don’t care if it’s a fork or wall street it wins.

No2x corporate takeover of bitcoin. Btc is about decentralization and money making miners and money making exchanges and profit  making funds want you to take their side. Ha you all forget that the once libertarians are now the enemy of decentralization. New comers do not be fooled!!

Xapo  you violated number 1 rule in crypto . Do not mess with the users!!! I  will never use them!!

Man more power to you!! and this the real reason I got into BTC, centralization given to corrupt people will lead to poverty, inflation, and  numerous other problems. Bitcoin give the power back to the people.
