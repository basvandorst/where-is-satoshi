Bitcoin doesn't work like that. Bitcoin is no different than cash pretty much, the only exception is that it's stored digitally and you have to worry about the priv keys as well.
How it worked on SR was the coins were in your account/wallet on the site. You had the option to either withdraw or use that account balance in your SR wallet to buy stuff. Lots of people kept some coin in their because why not, no rush to immediately withdraw all the time, plus they might want to buy stuff.
It's sort of similar to paypal vendors leaving their paypal balance in their account instead of immediately transferring, whatever their reasons.

I'd like to think so. I'm starting to develop flash games myself so it wouldn't be a bad thing to get paid/be able to pay in bitcoin over there as well.
In general, adoption is always a good thing.

You sound upset. I'm not going to bother responding to a throwaway. Do mind if you care to find any information for yourself, it's your fucking responsibility to look it up yourself. The information you seek can be found [here](

Actually this is very very huge. Kongregate is literally one of the hugest flash game websites. It has a lot of cool features that a lot of other ones don't like chat and global friends system.
Now, the most important thing on my mind I need answered is if developers and game devs can actually get paid in bitcoin.

Are you fucking serious? This is why I don't like this subreddit anymore since 1k subs.

I know that people have already responded to you, I just wanted to say that you should probably do more research regarding topics you don't understand fully before you type with abandon. Most people I know don't get their coin from exchanges, they get it from other people either in person or escrow service with another money transmitter. Then again, those people are a bit more of the paranoid types and tend to be in love with the concept of anonymity. (Which in this day and age, who can blame them at all? I don't even have to list reasons why....*cough* NSA, *cough* identity theft, *cough* banks)
Personally, the P2P aspect makes it a lot more friendly but a lot more volatile as well because there isn't insurance, you're in complete control of your money. If one loses their wallet, don't back it up or x reason, it's 100% that person's fault and no one else's. The problem with people today is that they don't want to do research at all for anything, especially new technologies. If people would just take a couple minutes out of their time and do some research on the internet for free and read a couple of paragraphs, they could make an actual informed opinion about any subject matter instead of many baseless assumptions.
Aside from OPs ridiculous post and some of the obvious butthurt people on both sides of the coin, bitcoin is revolutionary. It gives people power or at least some semblance of control over their finances, which is big considering banks fucking everyone over these days. I'd say it's almost on the same level with the printing press, people just haven't realized it yet because they not only haven't researched it, but don't care to understand it in the first place like any new thing in the world.
Just my 2cents anyways.

Actually yes, a good idea. There was a similar news report about how bitcoin is/could be changing Africa and how it works, especially since most of the time, the banks there have shitty fees and by the time you CAN afford a debit card, it's pointless because of the FEES.
Grubby business men, ugh. This will help the lower/developing class people just as much as a business man, politician, mob boss laundering money, or just a regular guy sending money to a friend because he can. But with low FEES.

I purchase from sr to treat depression as well. You have to think though, it's been explained on the forums as well as common sense:
You intend to purchase goods there, you do so. You don't buy cryptocurrencies, hold onto them, then buy. You purchase the coin. You deposit it. You pay for it your product. Worst thing can happen you lose 5-10% value, though I always buy when walls are up/trend is flat/going up.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:12:41
Good post. needs more posts like these, what bitcoin is TRULY about.
I'm glad you have found bitcoin :]

Well lately people have been hearing about all of those scams relating to investing and getting interest over time or even within a week or less. These include "buying" shares of new "companies" that usually don't have a domain name and use a fucking gmail address. 
friedcat on the other hand is pretty legit, everyone knows who he is and has been PROVEN to do good. While I wouldn't place 100% faith in it because anything can happen with investing, it'd place 99.9% of it.
Remember, bitcoin is still new. With new technology and businesses, will come scammers and liars. Just gotta wade through em all.

Have at least 5 different backs ups now including an offline savings wallet :) 
Glad you are doing better OP :]

Hm. Well I am in a bit of a financial pickle, no student loan money until most likely July, so I'd pay off rent with some coin. I'd donate 40 BTC to Sean's Outpost because I was once homeless for 6 months and I know how much it sucks. I'd spend about 10 BTC going around reddit tipping and making people aware of bitcoin/cryptocurrencies.
That leaves me with another 40 BTC. I'd probably set up a small faucet for 5 BTC for newer people, day trade with about 30 BTC and the last 5 BTC I'd just keep just incase of anything.

iirc, he had decided to sell off when it was going up to 266$ still. 
Edit: 
There ya go

Not sure if you are still sending, but played anyways. :)

I think maybe it's in everyone's best interest if this subreddit had better rules. You're right, this should be a community about bitcoin. There are other subreddits that don't allow meme garbage posted there, why not here?
@_date: 2013-09-06 06:08:48
I think it's mostly to show that the company isn't totally against it and it's good for PR. Bitcoins are associated with negativity when you ask the average person, they'll say "that internet money you can buy drugs with?". The CEO knows that it has a huge potential but as it is now, it's best to keep a lid on it; it messed with the whole paypal business model.
That being said, the CEO is really smart and paypal is one of the biggest scams ever, it's not even a bank. They'll probably jump on the bitcoin bandwagon first in the next couple of years if BTC really takes off.

Well it changes mining. It also created a whole new industry. There's plenty of pros you just gotta think.
@_date: 2013-04-20 23:01:48
Ugh no.

USAA. Online banking, depositing checks through smart phone, no fees, reimbursement for up to 12-15$ a month on atm fees. God damn best bank ever.
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:21:26
Fastest way would go be to go to the IRC and find people who will trade.
@_date: 2013-04-19 09:08:20
Ah glad I'm not the only one with the same problem. My bf is a gentle giant who is sorta anti-technology-nature-lovingly-hippieish. Everytime I talk about bitcoins, he acts like he is interested, but just tunes me out.
"omg good trends today. omg omgomg more merchants are accepting btc." (Yes I do say omg a lot irl :/)
"good for you babe"
And then if you mention your gender in btc related chat rooms, people start creeping on you. Seems like there is never a happy medium.

How would paypal handle bitcoin transactions? Chargebacks? Like how is this gonna work. Even with escrow and other things, I just don't see them working out very well. They have already been fucking people over constantly who deal with cryptocurrencies, just read the subreddit and you'll see a paypal related bitcoin tidbit.
I personally will never give them any business.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:16:20
Isn't this why merchants are supposed to cash out somewhat soon of when they get their bitcoins? I mean they can go up or down in value. The price at time/buying power will always almost fluctuate but it doesn't stop them from cashing out at the end of the day or keeping the coins themselves right?
If I was a merchant, like on sr or maybe even a retailer that accepted bitcoins, I would cash out when coins are worth a lot more like 200+ and then keep the coins for investment when they are lower, like now.
Bitcoin still works. It's the exchanges and prices that are changing it's FIAT value.

Likewise, totes would pay for this. I've been using pandora for years.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:16:05
Yes please. Downvote all of it. It's junk, takes up space, means nothing and it's kind of annoying. I understand it's an internet thing but seriously, other subreddits have rules that don't allow that shit. Why can't we?
