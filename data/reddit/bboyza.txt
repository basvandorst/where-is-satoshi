hehe, well I'm not too familiar with Canadians so I guess you then do sound it the same... which probably isn't helping :P

I guess it's the difference between American English and British English.
That poster describes exactly how I say it and everyone else in my region. Pronounce "your" to rhyme with "core", and "you're" to rhyme with "cure". I guess some regions use "cure" sound for both, other "core" sound for both.

Not according to this:
but should be noted that in practice "many/most British English speakers frequently use say /jɔː/ for both you're and your."

It's not that we get confused, it's just that it reads very badly and people who understand the language will immediately consider you an idiot for making the mistake (unless you aren't English).
The apostrophe (') in this case is indicating that a part of the sentence has been shortened, two words joined into one. It's = It is. You're = You are, Hasn't = Has not.
So when I read this sentence, "You're service is broken",  I get: "**You are service is broken**" &lt;-- which is fucking terrible English.
P.s. the sound "Your" and "You're" are different. (in British English, the same in American English apparently)

For "You're", the sound you make should sound more like "You are" than "Your". If they sound the same in your head than it is time to stop shortening it and rather write out the full "You are" instead until they start sounding different (correctly).
