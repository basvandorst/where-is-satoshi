I’ve withdrawn from bovada many times and I’ve never had a problem. I thought I did one time when my bovada balance was 0 and I didn’t see a transaction into my wallet but it turned out to take an extra half day for some reason. 
My only guess is that if you generated a new address before they sent it, then they sent the coins to the old discarded address

I’ve used cash app for buying bitcoin, but I only did it once. Hope nothing comes to me. Sorry OP that this happened to you. Praying you’ll get a good answer here so I can be mindful too. Good luck man

I was live sports betting for a long time on there too. I made most of it through small DCA investments at the end of last year (sub 4k) and gambling on NFL playoffs. I lost 1 whole BTC about a month ago on a very impulsive yet ‘safe’ bet (-5000 odds). Last inning of a baseball game and the opposing team hit a grand slam. I make less than 15k a year and I’m in my early 20s. The trajectory of my life has changed along with the expectations for my future. I’ve always had an addictive personality but I didn’t think I’d ever feel so defeated as I do now, after watching it grow 10k+. 
If you still have enough to be okay with, then don’t risk it. Don’t feel the defeat any deeper, just sever it and work on climbing up step by step. The off chance isn’t worth it man. Good luck to you bro

Wow, the banks and FIAT are going to do a whole lot to stop people from converting to bitcoin. More proof that it makes much more of a difference person-to-person than most realize

Woo I don’t know exactly how this works but good job!

I bought a Trezor Nano One and it’s been great, I love having the physical device secure at my dads house while I go to work and live a few cities over. If I get extra money and buy some bitcoin I usually use the cash app. I used to use coinbase to buy but I feel a lot better using cash app, plus it’s more convenient on my phone since I don’t always have my laptop. 
I’ll buy on cash app then hold it on there (faithfully since the owner of cash app is very supportive of crypto) until I can get back to my dads and transfer it to my device using my laptop
