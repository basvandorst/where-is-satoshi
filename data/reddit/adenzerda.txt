Hello. Please stop throwing around the term 'HTML5' like it's some kind of magic technology fairy dust that will solve every problem. It'll make my job a whole lot frustrating.

PSA: if you kept the pulled version, you might need to uninstall it before downloading the new one, otherwise you might get "not available" errors. Probably a bug in how the app store handles upgrades for pulled items
@_date: 2014-07-28 20:19:06
If you never uninstalled the old blockchain app you'll get this error. Uninstalling it before downloading the new one worked. That was my experience, anyway.

They'd have to know your wallet address. If that, for whatever reason, happens, simply make a new one. You can even make a new wallet for each transaction if you so desire.

I had to uninstall my old one to be able to install the new one. Probably some bug in the app store having to do with upgrading pulled apps.

It's not a good thing; people that already own some just want a fast growth on their personal investments. This kind of volatility proves that bitcoin is still in its infancy and is not a viable global currency yet.

I'm still sore after buying right before the last crash. That was pretty much my intro to owning btc: 'this seems like a cool concept, I'm going to get some. Hey, wait, where's my money going? Stahp! Come back!'
I'm not confident this inflated price is going to last and thus won't be buying any until it's reasonably lower or has proven itself to be stable at this price point.

I do like coinbase's customer service. Couple months ago I had a sell order that didn't 'go through' or something, and they refunded me my bitcoins plus 0.2BTC or so. Worked for keeping me happy!
Hopefully someday their online wallet feature set will be as good as blockchain's
@_date: 2013-09-10 21:29:46
Gonna have to agree with this one. If funds run short, having to oust people in April or July would be a shame. Having to do so in December or January would be downright dangerous.

OS X build doesn't work on my old-school MBP running 10.6.8; probably doesn't support its 32-bit architecture. Might want to put that requirement on the download page.
edit: remoted into my hackintosh running 10.8, able to run it just fine. However, when attempting to create a new account, the form submission just returns 'An error occurred, please refresh the page.' … How does one refresh the page? There's no menu option for it, cmd+r doesn't do it, neither does F5. Am I missing something?
Repeated attempts to create an account produce the same result. Looks like I'm left out of this one.

What I should probably do is buy some now, which will force the price to plummet as per my usual luck. Then I can buy the rest when it's at $50.

Well, their body text is  on  which is actually not too bad (I've seen some shit). It works out to a contrast ratio of about 5:1. [Accessibility guidelines define a minimum ratio of 4.5:1 for regular-sized text]( so *technically* it's not terrible. I'm willing to bet they lightened it a bit to make their subheadings stand out more for easier scanning.
However, “enhanced” contrast is defined as 7:1, so it'd be better if they bumped their text down a bit. They could easily make up the loss of contrast with the subheadings via use of additional whitespace.
(for reference,  on  is about 21:1)

Finally. I do like blockchain.info's app, but this is just so much more convenient because I buy btc with coinbase

Yeah, I just made an account with BitFloor the day before they announced all the shit with their bank account. So it's probably my fault. My bad.
