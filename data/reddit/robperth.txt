To keep in mind for the rest of the week 
futures contract expire on the 29 of March
they were taken out on the 15 December 2017
There was three sets of contracts started on the 15th
ending in January , February and March
So expect a lot of pushing and pulling leading up to 11 am N Y time on the 29th Friday
Then you can expect the price of Bitcoin to be pushed around all weekend and on Monday for the start of the new contracts
Just going on what happened with the last contracts
start dates and finish dates
Be safe stay in coin

who ever have bitcoin today 
will in the future say to them self why did i not buy more
I say that now and i brought at the start of 2017

I can only think of a few thousand reasons to sell
but hundreds of thousands of reasons to hold
who really knows what the future holds in a couple of years

with future trading so far all the traders who have taken a long position would have done their money so you would think future trading will take a dive and not affect BTC to the  same degree in the coming months

I use to think the most exciting thing in the word was making love to my wife
then I use yo think making love to some one else wife was the most exciting thing in the world
now I am thinking when Bitcoin starts up again on the up and up like when I first brought it early last year
that will be the most exciting thing in the world
i brought 50 G worth and before I new it I was up 200G +
what a pain opening all those accounts to start buying
and felling cheated by most of them
There is life changing amounts of money to be made from BTC and it will be moving up and up and you all be richer

if thousands of people move in to sell / trade
every time there is a move up wards is that like biting the hand that feed you
then cry when the market is not moving up or going down

I am a holder with 90% of my coins stored 
I trade with just a couple of BTC
i KEEP MY TRADING IN COINS MOST OF THE TIME 
IN AND OUT OF CASH FOR A SHORT TIME FRAME
ONLY LOOKING TO IN CREASE MY BTC

or is it better to cash trade looking to increase cash amount

Your the right type of person to make money 
You see their is a great investment in crypto
Spread your investment if that is what you see is best
jump on the gravy train
not every investment is a winner in life but you only need the odd one to to be and your life jumps to a new leavel
I started with a range of crypto in the start of 2017
be just stick to be blue chip crypto stock

I can.t see any one new investing in BTC
When they look at the history of the last few months
I invested in BTC at the start of 2017, bless BTC
and just been a holder except for a few coin that i have traded  in and out 
Now I am cashed up from a land investment can't see investing any more in crypto  this time
I look at crypto as an investment not as money 
every time BTC  moves up a few percent, millions of traders
sell bring the price down again .
I only see BTC jumping ahead when their is a threat of war as when the Rocket man up set Japan and the South
they were buying up big time
no new investors are going to jump on the gravy train while it is stopped or going back wards .
There are other investment that give a return that BTC is competing against 
When I trade I it seems like I am biting the hand that feeds me .

Japan was the ones who had 55 percent of trade yesterday 
And started the up ward movement 
From what I read
If that continue to day in Japan 
Or to night in the US
It pays to be in coin

mining  using solar or buying coins
or should I just buy another 10,000 sheep
