The fact that it can't be changed is an argument for taking time to look at problems, keeping things simple, and moving forward slowly. Bitcoin is not trying to mimic an impatient company that requires instant control and makes mistakes. This comes at a cost. One day something serious may go wrong, but that is a risk that is completely worth taking. Bitcoin is not conceding control to anyone for any reason and ideas of this nature are completely antithetical to it.
This is why they don't get it. Bitcoin is doing things a different way and they struggle to wrap thry minds around it.

The goal is not the demise of a physical financial institutions. The goal is the end of central authorities of money. Even if the world makes a 100% conversion to decentralized currency there will still be a need for the services offered by banks, such as safety deposits. Because of this, some version of the bank will probably continue to exist in the long term.

Understanding that bitcoin software does not simply come included with a force update button is apart of understanding why the network is resistant to manipulation. OP included his explanation that this makes the network 'censorship resistant' in his comment. 
Clearly if anyone does not understand this concept they don't understand bitcoin and the ideas behind it. If you don't understand this and what a force update included in the protocol then you don't understand it either. This argument is being made clearly yet you call a person a clown for saying this very thing.

Yes but it was also specifically designed to resist attempts to regulate it. We don't have to fear people who want to delve into this territory since if they go down the wrong path they will learn the hard lessons themselves.

Technically speaking the exchange is keeping the crypto in a wallet. It's just not your wallet and you should not consider it as such. Good practice is to only keep currency you plan to move on an exchange. 
I don't know the technical details of harmony but normally exchanges let you make transfers just like you would with a wallet you controlled, they just abstract it a layer.
About your trezor, at this point I'm the wrong person to ask. I would assume your trezor seed is only for one of the wallets on the device. Probably the bitcoin wallet.

Blocksize increase stops being possible when you say bitcoin is supposed to be a global currency and that the network could even take over as the primary financial system of the world. If changing the blocksize is the answer to that level of scaling then we are talking about gigabytes or more blocksize. Not acceptable when the network has to increase with the userbase and the nodes will never be able to finish those blocks in time. The blocksize has to stay and off chain solutions are the answer to scaling. Not this stupid answer.
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:26:01
Not sure. Looks like ledger doesn't support it either. If Harmony has the same features as bitcoin wallets then when you create a harmony wallet you will be able to get a seed. That seed will let you rebuild the wallet to it's up to date state on the blockchain. You can write it down, usually has a list of words and keep it very safe. You should be doing this for your bitcoin wallets too.
Best alternative to a hardware wallet is a wallet on a computer that you take offline. You could do it on an online computer if you must. Your phone is one of the worst places but that's why you back it up.
I Also feel obliged to reccomend against alt coins. Price is driven by consensus and alt coins will always struggle to gain the same consensus bitcoin has. The weren't the first and most technology factors will be addressed by offchain solutions like the lightning network.

Bitcoin is not a reasonable form of currency right now. That is true. It only serves as a store of value which happens to be very easy, but expensive to move.

Then you must not be familiar with most of the arguments for bitcoin. Banks are middlemen. When one person wants to pay another the money goes from one bank to another, or even to the same bank. Because of this banks are the sole determiner of whether or not your money exists or not. In the case of the federal reserve, these banks also get to determine fiscal policy. 
In bitcoin you own your account (so long as you possess the ability to transfer what's stored in it/don't store your coins on an exchange) because of this, the role of binance as an exchange has nothing to do with the role of a bank. The distinction is very clear.

If you compare it to gold it's fine. People will buy safes and keep the code securely. That demographic doesn't have a big hurdle to write down some words and store it the same way. They are already security conscious and distrust fiat. They just need to see that crypto is stable to get involved.
Compared to e banking it is miles behind. Eventually I believe services will appear that look more like a traditional bank. They'll have a savings account and everything else. A service they will provide is guaranteeing the ability to backup your coins on their side. Everything bitcoin will be abstracted away and the average user will not learn much about bitcoin itself.
This scenario seems like everything we hope to avoid but I'm not sure it negates the reasons we are here. Centralizing all the wallets is not a problem as far as I know. The rest of the world will keep up the race to have more bitcoin nodes, thus ensuring the network stays secure. I think just having the option enough to take your coins offline is powerful enough to justify bitcoin, even in a world where its uncommon.
Still, ideally we are moving towards a world where education about monetary systems increases, ushered in by the rise of bitcoin.

The ability to print money will absolutely become a question of sovereignty for sure. The International stage is anarchic as it is. The strong dominate the weak. Imagining a world where a government's supply of currency comes from the same pool as everyone else  will take much more conservative economic policy than they currently get away with.
I would love to see the end of boom-bust economics but I fear the transition will not be smooth. A world where even governments have no control over who has money could easily revert to a feudal situation where high earners are the new nobility and have control over their leaders.

Governments of the world use their ability to print money to protect the status quo. If they lose this ability they may lose their ability to project strength. For example, the US cannot handle a large devaluation of its currency AND an increasing debt AND project strength at the same time. It will quickly be in a situation where it can't pay people that will cause its strength to ebb away.
Now if you say that everyone suddenly loses faith in fiat, then fiat is worthless and the ability to print it is worthless. Every world government is now in the same situation. They can't project strength.
This opens a window for individuals to project strength. This is what Feudal lords did. They amassed  wealth and purchased land. Then they made made kings or didn't.
All this is to say that as people who want to see the end of fiat we are responsible for making that transition peaceful. This idea can bring complete anarchy or it could empower people over their government and finally have government been an institution that serves the people rather than the powerful.

The real comparison is hopefully to other currency, albeit with some radical differences to what we are used to, one of the big ones is that is deflationary not inflationary.
I don't like the gold comparison because it is not a commodity, which have intrinsic value. People would store USD like the store gold if it wasn't inflationary. In fact, they do it anyway.
I would like to know what the market cap is not comparable. I think it is because the market cap is meant to fluctuate, not go up and to the right all the time. Money is supposed to be moved in and out of bitcoin just like USD. Also a currency has to have a ridiculous 'market cap' to be considered reasonable I would guess. I don't want to try read whatever number the USD market cap is as it would probably hurt my head.

It has practical value as the store of value for the digital age, replacing gold. There is not value as a currency right now, maybe for large transactions outside of retail, but it is not used that way.
Gold has value because most people agree it is a desirable way to store value regardless of the fall of fiat. Bitcoin is the same, agreed upon value for no other reason than we simply agree. No one calls gold a bubble yet this is the state it lives in. 
Bitcoin is also deflationary and limited to only ~20 million coins. This makes owning a bitcoin highly desirable. It is not a viable currency right now, but with upgrades like the lightning network just around the corner it very quickly might become one. This would make it both a currency spendable everywhere the internet takes it and beyond while also filling the function of gold. Where fiat retirement savings tend to disappear with rising inflation, I would prefer my savings be in a currency that has to go up as it deflates.
When you consider that there is almost no money in bitcoin right now (maybe 10 billion of the 100 billion market cap could be extracted, but 100 billion is nothing when you talk about a global currency) it makes 10k seems like the bottom of a mountain.
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:29:01


I agree with everything except that gold has no intrinsic value. All precious metals have intrinsic value since one day a scientists or medical doctor might need it from you even after money has become meaningless. 
Gold definitely exists in a space well above its value as a commodity because it also functions as an asset.

Bitcoin was invented in response to 2008. The banks used their power over money to make the wrong decisions. Bitcoin is a decentralized solution that is ultimately outside banks and governments control.
People are definitely getting in bitcoin right now to get rich quick, but that is founded on the staying power it has thanks to the original idea. We can have both.

We will operate with different units once it is used as an actual currency. That's actually one of the best signs of adoption you can look for, when it becomes mainstream to speak in terms of ubitcoins or satoshis outside of places like this subreddit.

You say things like that makes them true.
He was an idiot and he didn't share his password. That's the truth. You can talk as long as you want about what someone "wouldn't do" but it doesn't matter. Its what he did.
Cold storage just means the wallet is not connected to the internet. You can say things about what a cold storage wallet should be but thats the working definition. Most good wallets will let you disconnect a wallet from the network.
Quadriga users didn't know any of this. There was never a press conference disclosing the exchanges processes. They all just assumed the exchange was using good practices. It just goes to show that were still in the wild west for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:47:50
Yeah. Those aws instances would be pretty low on cpu power. I think they are just trying to make it look like theres a lot of nodes to build trust. I think its had the opposite effect. Hopefully amazon cracks down on them because that would be a massive embarrassment  to B2X.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:32:37
My guess is that both participants will be using third party software that does this for them. Ideally the app would simply require the exchange rate to be the current standard.
@_date: 2019-12-06 05:00:26
Are we talking about the same thing? Quadriga collapsed because the owner died in india and the entire exchanges cold storage was on his laptop. They never got into it since he never shared the password with a responsible employee.

Privacy in bitcoin is poor. Everything is as public as possible. At a certain point it may be able to track a fair amount of wallets and who they belong to. There will likely come new techniques to combat this  but it is a big question mark.
The premise is flawed. Once you talk about cashing out you lose all the guarentees the bitcoin was able to provide. The government will certainly not let you get away without explaining the new income.

As I said. They were trying to capitalize on the instability. Anyone even giving B2X a chance was doing this. The reasonable choice that would have had the user's interests in mind was to NO2X.
@_date: 2019-12-25 22:12:55
I don't think you do. The bitcoin network is highly resistant to changes in the protocol that don't have a majority consent from the nodes. Bitcoin node operators are savvy.  They will not do updates that make changes they disagree with. This is one of the core teams biggest hurdles. They have to keep the faith of the node operators.

Do we consider GDAX the most important source? Thought we would care most about bitstamp, but i guess the sell walls aren't based on bitstamp they are based on exchange prices.

Most people don't disable JavaScript because our modern version of the web assumes it will be there. It is a basic part of any web page and there is no reason to disable it unless you are trying to lockdown your computer from doing anything useful.

Not attacking you. Just elaborating on the topic.

He is pushing an agenda but ultimately he has a point. The Core Dev team does represent the single greatest risk to bitcoin. No other type of currency has ever had a development team working on it before. This is new with cryptocurrency. For now I believe the operate with the best interests of bitcoin in mind but if you were to consider that they could all go crazy tomorrow bitcoin would sink with them and the trust in crypto currencies would go with it.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:51:23
Yeah segwit2x is a corporate effort to highjack bitcoin. This goes against the spirit of bitcoin, and we should be resistant to new groups who want to influence things this way.
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:06:59


Exactly. Amazon, Twitter, and SnapChat all have never posted a profitable quarter, yet they continue to encourage massive investment.
This is because the moment you post profit, it's all investors care about, and losing profit seems to be backwards progress. Instead companies like Amazon focus on actually spending more than they make. This is why Amazon regularly gives new plans for it's far flung futuristic ideas, because it is actually willing to spend the money to try some of them.
So Top Gear scaring away investors was an important blow to the company, as the weren't driven away by Elon alone at least. They definitely weren't scared away by his growth focus.

You get downvoted for being ignorant and making strong statements that are false. Watford is a excellent team going through some troubles. You would know about their success if you didn't just look at the current premier league table 1 month in as your only source of information.

I want you to link to a single place that agrees with your definition at all. Google searches return consistent definitions where inflation is only ever used to mean that something loses purchase power.

Why can't they make profit at 20k right now? I'm not very knowledgeable about the miner economy but wouldn't the block reward stay the same? As far as I can tell the same block reward with a higher price means more revenue for miners.

The early stages of the recession will be very rough for bitcoin. Institutions will want nothing to do with such a risky asset. We will have to work hard to present bitcoin as superior alternative to the current monetary system. 
How bitcoin comes out of its first recession will tell us  a lot about how easy the road afterwards will be.

Faith is critical in currency and people only have faith enough for one crypto. Not enough to go around.
However if they become treated as stores of value like gold there should be room for multiple.
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:24:33
In my opinion this is why BTC can't replace usd. It can be an alternative to gold and other assets that are supposed to keep their value with inflation. A crypto currency that includes inflation has to replace usd.
Edit btc
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:18:00
Not disagreeing with you but isn't the primary reason for inflation is for inflations sake. The idea being that inflation encourages people to spend money making the economy work and discouraging hoarding.
@_date: 2019-05-06 20:58:10
A quick search showed PeerCoin and YACoin. I don't think that's very current yet. I think we have a lot of hard lessons to relearn before an inflationary crypto becomes popular.
@_date: 2019-05-07 15:57:20
Mining is just the distribution mechanism. It will inflate the supply until it won't. After that it's a purely deflationary system.
@_date: 2019-05-11 22:13:25
The point is that putting your money where your mouth is hardly discredits you. After that it's about looking at the arguments the person makes, to see if they hold water.

Most people in this sub have put in money they don't need back and have resolved to sit on it until they think it has reached its destination. Whatever that might be, I think most people believe they will know it when they see it. If its 20k or 2m.
@_date: 2019-05-07 16:04:39
Can you provide a source for that
@_date: 2019-05-07 14:13:52
Its probably not a strong distinction but generally a person can be convinced to spend their savings at the right time. Currently with bitcoin we see that people rarely spend it and instead wait for the price to increase.  This is bad since bitcoins value doesn't intrinsically increase besides deflation. So it is treated like an investment when it needs to be treated like a currency with it's own economy. 
This is the current situation. People hoard bitcoin and bitcoin doesn't flow from one place to another. The public is trying to evaluate bitcoin like the usd but the deflationary nature of btc means that it will never behave like the usd.
@_date: 2019-05-07 05:51:06
That a good point. Having a crypto with no mining cap allows for perpetual inflation.
