Not saying that it’s smart, but being a lurker on this sub I can tell that the community sentiment is “What’s the worst that can happen?”.
  
The answer is: it’s pretty bad, pay your taxes. A lot of these early investors are young and feel invincible (myself included). I’ve seen what the IRS can do however, with most people I feel not fully understanding their power.

It can be decentralized and widely adopted and accepted by institutions in finance, commercial, and even government if it is embraced and enough users are in control of bitcoin to prevent 51% attacks.  
  
You won’t see a lot of people using the technology if it is illegal. Especially if the government pulls a “War on Crypto” and sends the FBI after major holders.  
  
I don’t know about you, but I have more ambitions for bitcoin than being a blackmarket underground cash alternative. I want the masses to use it.

Nothing wrong with different ambitions. I can definitely understand your stance better from that perspective. I disagree that you would be able to prevent governments from forcefully collecting taxes (as long as you physically live in said country), but I’m not all knowing all seeing. Governments should fear their people, but people are stupid and easily manipulated (especially in large numbers). The Civil War cemented in my mind that even if a large number of citizens in the U.S. were to revolt to the point of all out war they would get defeated.

Dude look at the entire graph of BTC’s history. What the hell do you see?

If the United States banned bitcoin for becoming to competitive with the dollar you’d see $1000 again...

May I ask... why now? 
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:23:41
Most people won’t be claiming their BTC gains.
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:39:57
Or feel great for the people who sold above $11k and rebought below $7k.

The United States banning bitcoin would be a major setback for bitcoin (maybe even leading to its complete fall). The United States has the largest amount of bitcoin users, the largest amount of bitcoin ATMs, and the largest number of bitcoin trading volume - [Thomson Reuters](  
  
It’s also only one scenario that could lead to a major crash. A superior cryptocurrency that becomes widely adopted and accepted (especially by institutions in finance/commercial/government) would kill bitcoin. Many in the Ethereum community believe they are the BTC killers.  
  
The point is that confidence in a currency to the point that you remove objective reasoning is hazardous to your financial health. Black Swan events happen all the time.

The bubble is popping. There has been a series of articles in the WSJ about different things impacting bitcoin lately (just Google it), but what's been happening since the ATH is a classic bubble pop.
