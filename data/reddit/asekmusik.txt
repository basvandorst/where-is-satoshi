Because he was a prominent figure in pop culture for a time and by saying this, more people hear about it. Any endorsement is good endorsement (to an extent, I guess).

I guess that makes sense. It's probably all about how it sounds when you read it in your head.

the issue is intent. if you were purposely dodging 10,000 for reasons to not set off the "suspect alarm" then you're doing something illegal. if you're making smaller deposits strategically for your own gain, not trying to game the 10,000 threshold, it's different. but it's on you to prove it.

What do I do with this if I don't have a wallet? :o
Edit: I now have a wallet. Well, tipping is an effective way to spread bitcoin, I guess.

If you post here frequently, he's probably seen you around. There are a lot of guys from that I see around reddit from time to time that I've upvoted upwards of 50 times.

To be fair, it seems like a egg/chicken situation. There really isn't all that much that can be done with Bitcoin just yet (as places are still opening up transactions with them), so using it as a "stock" is just what everyone's doing -- which is, in turn, holding it back from being used as a currency... Because the infrastructure just isn't there yet. 
You see what I mean?

Because it'd pay off? And if it doesn't, he still has the money?

I'm not really seeing how it's misleading. Is it just how it's read?
