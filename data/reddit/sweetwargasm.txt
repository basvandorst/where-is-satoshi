Well... If I hash them both and they are the same, I should get the same value returned.  Right? 
Also, if the code is open source, I could compile it myself.

Is the code open source or do I just have to trust you?

I bought LTC when it hit $86 ath.  Now it's over $200 and peaked at 300 something.  
I bought btc at $1,313 and it was an Ath. Now it's over 15k. 
everyone who bought at 19k just needs to be patient. They aren't idiots. They are just new to this type of thing. Give it 3 months and i bet we will all be sitting here wishing we had bought more while it was still 19k...

PayPal is a private company... they can refuse to provide service just like any other company.... besides, their are multiple other PayPal competitors that can provide the same service.
