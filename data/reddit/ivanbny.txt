I didn't see the word legitimacy mentioned in the Satoshi whitepaper. I do think it mentions the majority of the computing power however. I'm sorry many people would like it to be different, but at the end of the day the majority (51%) can make changes to bitcoin and if there are enough users to accept those changes then there's no stopping it.
While I won't disagree that a 51% hard fork would be bad for Bitcoin, I also would not fight it and would not try to remain in the 49% minority.

|It's important to realize that these technical improvements (like segregated witness, Lightning Network, and the possibility for later dynamic blocksize adjustment BIPs with less effect on orphan rate) is what the XT crowd's ultimate leadership is afraid of, and working against, when they advocate hurried choices that happen to be irreversible.
Uhh, no one I am aware of is actively working against LN or SW. You want to know what the XT crowd is afraid of? Bitcoin which is incapable of being hard forked, Bitcoin which has far slower adoption than it should have due to artificially high fees pushing out users and Bitcoin without giving users choices on everything INCLUDING consensus rules. It's fine that some Bitcoin Core devs want to be conservative. It's not OK that bitcoin.org, bitcointalk.org and r/bitcoin want to suppress discussion or the ability for users to express decisions with the only mechanism they have - running Bitcoin software that makes consensus decisions.
@_date: 2015-12-09 20:46:45
Considering that "widest support possible" could mean as low as 51%, this statement is pretty uncontroversial. Literally everyone wants the widest support possible.
Do you think that 95%+ support could not be achieved for a SegWitness hard fork?
@_date: 2015-12-28 14:55:52
Only by the 49%. For the other 51% it is business as usual. Replace the numbers with 75% or 99% if it makes you happy, but the point is that whether you like it or not, what makes Bitcoin work is the majority computing power + the users + the merchants. Majority rules = democracy.
@_date: 2015-12-28 01:57:28
For fuck's sake, bitcoin.org - doesn't this *feel* wrong to make this sort of a decision? These types of actions are blatant attempts at stifling the community. We are not the borg, we do not all think alike nor was that ever part of the bitcoin social contract!
Yes, Bitcoin requires consensus to function. However, the very fact that it requires consensus means that there is a mechanism to address disagreements - mining, full nodes, economic actors, etc. Bitcoin.org, bitcointalk.org and r/bitcoin are not to be used as tools to pseudo-represent consensus!

One thing I don't get - will sidechains transactions require mining fees? 
If not, then why will the miners bother merge-mining and all of the overhead and time spent merge mining multiple sidechains, storing the blocks, passing network traffic etc.
If yes, then are the fees paid in the sidechain value? If so, doesn't that mean that the sidechain value ultimately has to diminish in comparsion to the 'locked' BTC? If you move 1BTC into a sidechain with parity price, say 1 BTX, what happens after doing a bunch of transactions? If you now have 0.9 BTX, you can't recover more than 0.9 BTC. What happens to the remaining BTC?
@_date: 2015-12-28 14:23:06
Ha. Because you'd sue Coinbase for say XT/BIP101 activating with 75% miner support?
It goes to show that the biggest worry that many have in this community is that consensus is equal to democracy or popular vote, which is just fact. If 51% of the miners, wallet users and merchants decide to change Bitcoin then it changes. Why fight it? Why even suggest that you'd sue, as if somehow that would change anything?
Bitcoin = 51% of the economic interest in the community. There's no getting around this. 
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:47:12
I agree with OP. There's no reason that a new casual BTC user would enjoy running Bitcoin Core / QT. SPV wallets offer a superior experience with enough security to secure reasonable spending amounts, similar to holding physical cash in a wallet.

Thanks - that makes sense. I still don't think you can do PoS since that wouldn't be compatible with merge mining but I'm not 100% sure about that. Anyway, for the standard SHA PoW sidechain, it's pretty clear. Fees will get paid, the miners will collect the fees and either hold "SIDECOINS" or redeem them for BTC.

@_date: 2015-12-28 16:51:01
Realistically, I don't think a 51% hard fork would last very long. Miners and exchanges would have to decide very quickly which side of the fork to be on or close their doors. Once the majority of businesses have decided, the value of BTC on the short side of the chain ends up plunging to near zero.
Again, it's not *my* democracy. Please explain how you read this and don't end up with majority rule, aka, democracy?
|We have proposed a system for electronic transactions without relying on trust. We started with
the usual framework of coins made from digital signatures, which provides strong control of
ownership, but is incomplete without a way to prevent double-spending. *To solve this, we
proposed a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions
that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes
control a majority of CPU power.* The network is robust in its unstructured simplicity. Nodes
work all at once with little coordination. They do not need to be identified, since messages are
not routed to any particular place and only need to be delivered on a best effort basis. Nodes can
leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what
happened while they were gone. *They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.*

|It's true that 1MB was an arbitrarily selected cap size. However, the fact that many miners and mining pools are using a soft cap of 750KB (due to orphan risk) demonstrates that 1MB is - currently - a pretty optimum maximum size. Changing the single maxBlockSize constant value will have little effect if larger block's are not profitable to mine.
This was true in the past, now the vast majority of miners make blocks right up to 1MB in size. Taking a brief skim over the last few days only Slush has been making 750KB blocks.
I'd say it's safe to say that the optimal size is certainly larger than 1MB.
@_date: 2015-06-18 22:23:58
Some of the core devs seemed comfortable with the wait and see approach - we would almost certainly have been waiting for another year or more before action would have been taken by which point capacity could have been in jeopardy.
@_date: 2015-06-24 13:04:28
I'll take Gavin's rational vision for improvement any day over alternatives that give no vision for how changes would be implemented. A system where a small (I'm calling 25% small) minority get complete veto power over important changes is not sustainable. If Bitcoin were to continue down this path then this would be a reason that Altcoins may have a future - why enable this to happen?
I also take issue with the idea that anyone on the ~ 25% side is going to "play chicken." If even 51% of miners start running the '8MB version', no exchange, or miner is going to want to reject 8MB blocks and then hope that somehow their investors or customers will accept their stance. Rather than be left with a valueless token, once a majority is reached, broad consensus will be quick to follow.
As mentioned, it's a thoughtful argument but ultimately rings hollow since it brings up a problem without an answer for how to address it. It feels more based upon religious ideals that Bitcoin can't be changed unless *everyone* agrees than the reality which is a supermajority will always be able to make the changes they desire.

If we can at least roll out one 8MB hardfork, it shows that this can be done smoothly and allows for a successful precedent to be set. I agree that a 20MB or 32MB size increase would be preferred, but these changes require time.

If it's merely that the models for bitcoin merchant processors aren't the only ones that matter, I think that you'll get agreement. However, Jeff isn't arguing this - merely that if 1MB blocks are the future then the core devs should give an indication that this not going to change within an estimated X months and that users and merchants should plan for this. He's arguing for dissemination of information.

In practice his theories are may be just fine - as you've said, it depends entirely upon the nature of the supply curve. Since you've done nothing to illuminate the actual nature of the block size supply curve, there's no reason to believe that the curve is any flatter than you feel it might be.

- It's an innovative way to create a community reward system
- People are incentivized by an initially worthless token for doing things they already enjoy doing. Eventually the cycle should feed value into the tokens (there already is some value in the form of LTB podcast sponsorships and the occasional pizza)
- I don't think it's ever been done before.

Agreed on the difficulty adjustments, however, it's still entirely possible that there won't be enough of an ecosystem built around a weaker fork. I do not believe there are many miners, exchanges, merchants or devs that want to participate on a minority chain of Bitcoin.
There aren't too many features other than block size which A) have to be hard forks and B) are as controversial. Given this, it seems likely that any desirable features built into the weaker chain could or would be included in the more dominant chain.
At any time, ANY miner can decide to hard fork Bitcoin. Users can follow a shorter chain, merchants can accept payments via that chain. However, unless there's enough of an ecosystem I think it's fairly easy to see how it would fail completely.
@_date: 2016-01-29 21:32:25

I agree with everything you just said. I just imagine that it's extremely disheartening to tell new users that they aren't participating members of the Bitcoin community because they use Mycelium, Blockchain.info or even Coinbase. Most users of money services will by definition end up being casual users who don't care about how something works or giving back - nor should they. 
Additionally, many users won't be able to afford running a full node - if someone earns less than $1000/yr then they won't be able to afford even a raspberry-pi, persistent broadband or perhaps even persistent electricity.
I get it - full nodes will be run by power users, businesses and enthusiasts and this will be critical to keeping Bitcoin running. However, there's no need to be dismissive of participants however they may choose to use Bitcoin.

If no one will buy a miners coins then it's not profitable at any difficultly.

Yup - I'm all for Core leading the charge and going to 2MB blocks followed by SW or in parallel with SW. However, people get stuck to certain arguments and then stick to their guns almost no matter how strong the opposition grows. It would be great if ego wouldn't get in the way here and a compromise could be struck but I feel that this will either only happen at the 11th hour or after the hard fork is pushed through.
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:48:09
Sure, the soft fork itself should not take that long. However, it could take a year for the majority of transactions to use SW, no?

Have some faith in miners, users and merchants who make decisions about what client software to run. The majority are not sheep that will be easily swayed to foolish decisions.
Also, in the case that we somehow manage to agree to HFs that bump the block size up so far that most nodes stop dropping off the network, it's only a soft fork to reduce the max block size down again.
No single person or dev team is ever going to be 'in charge of Bitcoin' ever again. I really do have hope that Core does 90% of the critical consensus level development work going forward but the mere fact that BTCD, Classic, Unlimited, LJR, etc exists and gets used means that they'll have to be mindful of their 'customers'. Most features core introduces will get accepted. Some won't. Welcome to FoSS development, with the obvious difference being that division hurts us more than typical projects.

Theymos chose to implement an unpopular 'moderation' policy of not allowing discussion of the implementation of hard forks without having some sort of prior consensus.

I take no opinion on that, but it's clear that there was causality between the two actions.

OK, but it's a fair point that those that believe that 2-4-8 to be the best scaling solution aren't going to see the proposed solution as inclusive of their needs. Maybe the core plan is superior, maybe not - but there are a number of devs offering a block size increase now. For the short term, the core devs oppose that and that's why their scaling solution can't be said to include a HF block size increase of any kind. The proposed scaling announcement from rshea is dramatically different than reality.
@_date: 2016-01-17 15:54:00
Miners have invested massively in SHA256 mining equipment and they are not going to mine on the less profitable chain.
While it's possible that the weaker fork would not spiral down indefinitely due to a few hardcore supporters, they would likely would likely be isolated enough to be irrelevant to the main chain. 
There were miners in 2012 that refused to go along with the halving to 25 BTC per block. It's my opinion that any weaker fork chain would go the same way that the 2012 50 BTC per block minority went - the participants just can't get enough momentum and give up.

@_date: 2016-01-19 21:29:58
Yeah, if you're willing to play russian roulette. Bitcoin without the mining infrastructure invested in over the last few years, who wants in? *crickets*
At that point, why not just hard fork in a bunch of stuff:
* ring signatures
* confidential transactions
* SW as a hard fork (it's cleaner)
* anything else in the wishlist
At least then it would be an interesting altcoin instead of Litecoin 2.0

No, it doesn't violate any rules right now - not until code is written and compiled. I'm hoping that the policy is loosened/changed especially now that the Core devs have stated they believe topics should be allowed to be debated.
@_date: 2016-01-27 02:08:30
No one has to negotiate with ransom demands. On the other hand, ask yourself why a large number of miners, users and companies in this space are pushing for changes so hard they're willing to push a HF w/o Bitcoin Core being onboard? The mere fact that so many disagree should make for enough motivation to have a sane discussion about how to solve problems together as a community. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 13:01:49
Except miners mining on the old chain need to sell their coins to someone. Without buyers, what's the point in expending massive amounts of electricity on nearly-worthless coins? It's a self-defeating downward spiral once a supermajority have left the shorter side of the fork.

It only makes sense if there aren't superior offers from competitive firms. Blockstream doesn't have a lock on talent or good ideas - they do have a lot of funding, the majority of which appears to be dedicated to dev salaries and incentive compensation. I don't blame Blockstream devs from jumping onboard - they probably made the wisest decision given the available offers. Competition would be good here.

As a suggestion, stop using the populism vs technical debate argument. Merely because something is popular does not make it incorrect.

* There will be no tokens associated with any R3 crypto-infrastructure.

Then don't be convinced! Run a node, spend your coins with only services/merchants that agree with your mindset, argue, dissent. If you're right then there will be enough others that agree with your viewpoint that you'll be in the economic majority. You don't need censorship.

The best way to decentralize bitcoin is to get more people to use it.

Let me put it more plainly. I would like for prominent community members (or all community members really) to speak their opinions on the censorship that is being conducted. It's either that or the core devs keep getting pressure to make changes the community supports which seems to be at least part of the reason that gmaxwell has given up his core committer role, which none of us should be thrilled about.
@_date: 2016-01-18 13:30:17
Agreed on all points except  The "at some point after SW..." is too vague and would have caused much of the same problems we are at now. Miners, users and dissenting Core Devs would have pushed for these to be done in parallel since most people agree that it would take over a year to get a hard fork pushed through safely. Starting on the max block size hard fork sometime in 2017 is too late.
@_date: 2016-01-12 13:23:49
True, but there have been other changes underfoot over the last few years. Many users are probably what would be called casual users and they will prefer to use either a mobile wallet or a web/exchange wallet for the ease of use. Much of the reduction of full nodes can be attributed to the fact that users have other options and they often take the easiest, lowest cost, fastest method.
It's still reasonable to expect that if Bitcoin became more important we'd have more university researchers, more corporate developers and more individuals willing to run a full node. If Bitcoin stays niche, the number of people willing to run a full node also stays niche.
@_date: 2016-01-27 13:11:58

This is a terrible analogy. The space shuttle was designed for a very narrow purpose and use - namely to send ~ 8 people and a couple of satellites into space and return safely. It was never intended to be used by millions nor could NASA's space program ever have been called "infrastructure".
Bitcoin is by definition open to everyone. Anyone can write/suggest code changes, anyone can mine, anyone can have a wallet or run a full node. By definition, it is financial infrastructure that the user is expected to participate in.
So now that developers have written something where the user has a programmatic means of participation, they want to take it back and allude that the end user should go mind their own business? Like it or not, there is a meritocratic element fundamental to how Bitcoin works. No amusing cartoons will change that.
@_date: 2016-01-12 21:12:59
While I do think that Satoshi would have supported an increase in the max block size, that doesn't matter. He set Bitcoin in motion and then pulled back from exerting influence on the direction of development. Whether people think that Bitcoin Core is deviating from his vision or not, looking to Satoshi to decide this debate isn't the answer.
@_date: 2016-01-22 14:09:18
Yes. Literally everyone [any age bracket, wealth level, etc] can afford to invest 1% of their discretionary income on Bitcoin - the key part is having discretionary income.
Secondarily, do you really want to bet against the only significant financial invention in the last 50 years? What has been invented since then?
- loans? no - invented 4000 years ago
- insurance? no - invented 3000 years ago
- options trading? no - invented 300 years ago
- wire transfers? no - invented 150 years ago
- ATMs - no - invented ~60 years ago
- credit cards - no - invented ~ 60 years ago
Similar to the Internet in the 1990s, people in traditional finance in 2016 just don't get it. Invest what you can afford to lose, get a cold wallet and ride it out for a few years.

The hashrate alone isn't the only factor. If there's an even 50-50 split but 90% of the merchants, exchanges and users pick a chain, then miners on the economic minority chain will have a hard time selling them.
@_date: 2016-01-20 14:12:43
Technically, it appears that the majority of hashing power and entities that buy/sell/trade/hold bitcoins are supportive of a block size increase. Technically, this is how bitcoin works.
"Nodes can leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what happened while they were gone. *They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.*"

If you see anyone who disagrees with consensus rules as the equivalent as malware distributing wallet thieves then you're going to have a hard time finding others to agree with you.

XT/BIP101 had/has some Bitcoin core dev support, some Bitcoin miner support and certainly some Bitcoin user support. I think that it's fairly easy to distinguish between that and altcoins which do not have any indications of support from Bitcoiners. Given the alternative which is censorship of ideas and the manipulation of consensus, I'll risk the so called "altcoin showcase" you describe.
@_date: 2016-01-31 01:13:10
By first step, I presume that you're speaking of future hard forks, yes? If so, I imagine that each proposal will be evaluated by the community at large. As is clear, you can't just force the majority of the community to accept a change. Only if the majority are willing does it get included.
There is a balance between blocks that keep the on-chain growth going as it has over the previous few years and blocks getting too large to run on typical home equipment/broadband.
Do you really think that users will be too stupid to not be able to decide in the future if this balance tips too far one way or the other?

Bitcoin is for everyone, so yes, if JP Morgan, FedEx, Citi and the Rothschilds want to get involved, hire core devs, buy BTC, mine, run an exchange, they should go for it. Are you really concerned that Citigroup is going to start up a massive ASIC farm? It would be an unbelievably good thing - unbelievable because it's not going to happen. It gives far too much independence to users and for this reason most of these companies are going to be opposed to Bitcoin, not embracing it.

@_date: 2016-01-18 13:55:16
We have a mechanism for dealing with this. It's called miners and users - if Classic proposes a change that isn't reasonable, it'll get rejected.
For all the controversy and hand waving over XT, the lesson here is that it wasn't accepted by the economic majority. The system is working.
@_date: 2016-01-12 13:16:24
I for one certainly didn't think that Coinbase would ever support anything other than the longest chain with economic majority support. Only the unjustifiably paranoid would suggest otherwise.
@_date: 2016-01-18 19:52:00
There is absolutely no way that we'll have an effective block size of 2MB in April 2016. Soft fork needs to be introduced, wallet software needs to be updated, users need to start making new SW transactions, hardware wallets need to be updated, lots of testing needs to happen. I'm not hating on SW - it's a brilliant idea, but let's not kid ourselves. It'll be many months before we see close to a 1.7x in scalability which would basically require 100% of the transactions on the network to be SW transactions.

I would be perfectly supportive if bitcoin.org noted that all web wallets where the end user does not control the key may be unsafe. I would also be perfectly supportive if bitcoin.org noted wallets such as XT or unlimited that don't agree on consensus rules and warned users of this feature. Information frees users to make decisions. "Protecting" users by hiding information is not what users have asked for and it rubs against the spirit of what Satoshi invented.
Isn't it clear that Satoshi didn't build something which depended upon bitcoin.org to create and enforce consensus?
@_date: 2016-01-04 14:01:36
Agreed - miner ability to make changes is relatively limited. However, miner ability to block changes is high - similar to core dev abilities to block changes.
@_date: 2016-01-27 02:17:12
Actually, it's not that dumb. If you are mining or creating blocks, exceeding the 1MB limit will in all likelihood just orphan your block unless there's widespread support for larger blocks. On the other hand, accepting say 2MB blocks would mean that if there is a fork you would stay on the longer PoW. This is what Bitcoin Unlimited does - create smaller blocks than you accept.

Davenport is great and clearly is trying to provide a market driven means for solving this problem. However, I feel like this entire exercise in price discovery between majority and minority chains is a waste of time. Miners will quickly stop mining on the less profitable SHA256 coin and then that ends the entire thought experiment. This exchange process will be useful for a few hours, if it even works at all.
@_date: 2016-01-18 15:18:14
There are no better developments that will make a block size increase unnecessary. LN requires a larger block size. SW will take a year, gives us a modest increase and then we're back to where we are now about a year later. I support both of those projects as they are needed but that doesn't mean there's an excuse for not putting a plan down on paper.
Listen to the miners, merchants and other users that say that "eventually" isn't good enough. Saying eventually in this manner, really means "No, we don't support it at this time."
@_date: 2016-01-13 03:33:32

I'm not suggesting that people should be ignorant of VPS providers and certainly should not store private keys for anything significant anywhere on the internet. The point is that bashing companies and users that host nodes in the cloud is also unhelpful. Every stable node offers an endpoint from which to do the IBD (initial block download), it offers redundancy and it offers extra networking options, regardless of whether the end user can touch them or not.

I would predict that this single issue is going to make adoption of 0.12 significantly slower than 0.11. Miners, users and merchants aren't raising their hands up to say they want this feature.

Bitcoin = money. Money is not purely technical - there are economics at play here and engineers are not always going to have the right economic / game theory analysis. Call it politics if you will, but there this isn't a pure science situation with only one right answer.

I am sure about it. I think that most Bitcoiners have no problem understand that an attempt to rebuild Bitcoin w/o the key pillars will work, but only for a walled garden system which doesn't deliver the value that Bitcoin creates.
Think about it - if CitiCoin is released tomorrow and accepted by Chase, Deutsche, etc - how does this affect Bitcoin? As an end user, you won't have direct access to the tokens, nor will you be able to use it in a P2P manner. It'll essentially be PayPal 2.0 with some cryptography (maybe). Bitcoin ignores all of that.

Perhaps they only run an SPV node, which this thread alleges? In this case, it would be even easier to isolate and trick them into reporting on a fake transaction.

Heh - exactly. 1MB blocks limit growth of transactions and users and push transactions to off chain services such as coinbase. If people want bitcoin to succeed, getting more users transacting on chain is critical. Doing that requires larger blocks.

The problem is that a fair chunk of the bitcoin developers believe that no changes should ever be considered unless THEY come to consensus first. Users, merchants, investors, exchanges, wallet providers wishes and intentions only count secondarily.

I upvoted your response, starmaged. I don't agree with your analysis and believe that needs to be open to discussion of anything relevant to bitcoin that users want to discuss. However, I do think that users have gone too far in downvoting the minority here who think that XT discussions have no place on bitcoin. In the process of coming together and revising our opinions, we need to keep these discussions civil.
I think that the first step for the anti-XT crowd is to stop calling it an altcoin. The more you do this, the greater the divide since clearly there are many (most) who don't feel that it's anything more than a version of bitcoin that hews closer to the original Satoshi social contract.
What can we do to allow this discussion of XT to take place on r/bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-22 18:42:48
In 1995, 20 years ago, the typical computer:
- 4MB of RAM
- 500MB HDD
- 56K download, 33.6K upload speeds
Bitcoin would have been impossible to handle anything more than 1000 users. Times change and in 20 years, 1MB blocks will be laughable. 8GB might be too large but it's always easier to limit block size than it is to increase it since that's just a soft fork.
@_date: 2015-08-20 02:37:06
One thing that Adam Back seems to ignore is that if XT succeeds, all core needs to do is to implement a variation of BIP 101 and then there's no need to have developers develop on XT. There will be two clients with compatible consensus rules and slightly differing implementations.

Saying that you want things to calm down out of one corner of your mouth while stating the above out of the other corner of your mouth doesn't paint a good picture of stewardship. It feels very, very much like you want to start a war and that this is your means of planting a flag in the ground. I have a strong feeling that you're going to regret your actions with suppressing the community interest - at the least, it's going to diminish your reputation and role within Bitcoin.

Under BIP 100, a minority of miners could harm bitcoin by keeping blocksize permanently at 1MB. Isn't that a good enough reason to not leave it purely to miners?

While I think that Peter Todd is an intelligent guy and hr does bring some valid critical arguments to design discussions, I'd say he has some gaps in his understanding of realities in mining accessibility.
He spoke at an event last night where he was rather dismissive of advantages that larger, more capitalized miners have over the individual that can only afford a single miner. It's ridiculous to think that someone with $5k to spend on mining has a reasonable expectation of similar profitability as someone with $5m to invest. The larger investment will secure lower cost chips and a place in line many weeks or months ahead of someone that needs to pay retail costs and can't negotiate a contract directly with a chip supplier.
I could go on, but I think it's rather clear to most people that going on ebay and buying some equipment will not get the same experience as firm like KNC or Antminer designing, fabricating and running their own ASIC equipment.

Yes, I get that's your intention. However, when those people leave r/bitcoin that may make the reddit thread calmer, but it also cements the schism that the community clearly already has. It solidifies and justifies Hearn and Gavin's position that the best way forward is to leave the arguments behind and just work on steamrolling over the minority opinion.
I could be wrong, but discussion on this topic would have made for a better chance to come to agreement rather than what we have now.

Don't kid yourself. If other states/countries follow suit or are pressured into either similar regulations or just reduced banking for bitcoin businesses, it'll hurt BTC adoption the world over.

It'll be 20 years before BIP 101 allows for an 8GB block. You don't think that will be enough time to allow for a soft fork as Bitcoin blocks gradually gets bigger, one block at a time?

Excellent article. Hearn and Gavin have tone nailed down - without any malice, I really hope that some of the Blockstream people can look at articles like this and take some pointers about how to convey themselves.

Bitcoin is by no means widely distributed with less than .01% of the population holding any significant balances of BTC.
We can see what happens when fiat dried up in Greece. People didn't turn to BTC - they turned to store credit at the largest local stores available.
Don't get me wrong, Bitcoin has survived very well and growth has been very good for a 6 year old money-like token. However, this is only the beginning and growth can easily be derailed, slowing adoption dramatically.

@_date: 2015-08-16 22:42:57
If you want to work on mining decentralization which it seems that your post revolves around, focusing on the block size is a waste of time. Mining centralization can be reduced but it would require  changes such as the ghost/DECOR+++ protocol such as that proposed by Sergio Lerner.
IMO, we could change blocks back to 500KB or even smaller and it would not by itself change node count or reduce mining centralization.

BitcoinXT is bitcoin OR bitcoin is a centralized product controlled by 5 core developers. Without allowing the end user/miner/merchant/exchange/wallet provider the ability to run their own software we might as well just create a "bitcoin board" and elect the core devs every year.

Relevant comments on the bitcoin-dev mailing list:
"They do not run anything but BitcoinJ (evidenced by them blindly following invalid chains), so no proper consensus checking going on here at all. Connected to my nodes is a bad peer (doesn’t relay inventory but downloads everything) from 37.187.136.15, with the user agent /BitcoinJ:0.12SNAPHOT/Satoshi:0.2.0/ which is owned by blockchain.info. You can also submit an invalid transaction through their /pushtx interface and get a mixture of noise and BitcoinJ error messages out of it as well. 
If even the people who have to their claim hundreds of thousands of wallets are relying on their security don’t bother running even a single node to sanity check against, who are we really going to expect people to in the future if the load goes 8x, 16x, 32x higher? Like CoinBase and others, these are the companies which are claimed will be the ones supporting the network with ludicrous sized blocks because they have a financial incentive to. 
Well, they don't even do it now when it could be achieved with a $5 VPS."

I am upvoting this because I don't want it to get lost. Adam, no one questions that you're a brilliant cryptographer and you seem like a genuinely caring person. However, when the President of Blockstream, employing a significant number of developers contributing to bitcoin core suggests that he would intentionally lie to the network in order to create a split and cause miners to lose money that should make people question your leadership. Say what you will about Gavin and Mike, but they are NOT operating on deceit, which you suggest you might.

@_date: 2015-08-12 20:38:28
That's fine, but I don't see this as a binary situation - the world is too large for bitcoin to be centralized or decentralized. It's a matter of gradients as well as ebbs and flows.
The rise of a single exchange, gox, was a centralizing factor but also a positive growth factor since it proved that there was interest in price discovery and trading bitcoin.
The rise of blockchain.info was a centralizing factor since perhaps 50% of wallets were on bc.i, however, it was also a positive growth factor making it easy for anyone with a low level of knowledge and expertise to participate.
The rise of large mining companies and pools (asicminer briefly had &gt;40% of the hash rate as did BTCGuild, etc) made it easy for many people to mine (or at least invest in Asicminer) but also created entities that could suppress or damage the confirmation process.
All of these things have happened for both the benefit and detriment of Bitcoin. The question is in the balance, are we better off now? I would answer yes, because we benefited greatly from the growth and managed to overcome the threats to decentralization.
Lastly, I would point out that the hardest thing for governments to shut down is the thing that everyone uses and fights to keep, eg Uber. Bitcoin needs to ride on top of banking and regular users if it wants to thrive and survive. To that end, I'll take a tradeoff with imperfect decentralization in order to get massive amounts of growth.

While I respect their opinions, I think it's hard to believe that block size has done much to stop users from turning off full bitcoin core clients or that having a 500K or 250K block size would in turn get more nodes online somehow.
The block size has very little to do with centralization, IMO.

That's ridiculous. XT is completely compatible with Bitcoin core unless a supermajority of blocks are marked with BIP101 and then a miner chooses to make a larger block. At that point, XT would be Bitcoin and Core would no longer be.
Since XT/BIP101 has a small minority of mined blocks, XT = Bitcoin Core = BTCD.

@_date: 2015-09-17 12:59:15
Huh? You might want bitcoin to be more narrowly used, but it seems that you are likely in a minority of users.
@_date: 2015-09-18 03:09:05
Yeah, but most CFTC registered firms such as FCMs are going to have high minimum capital requirements. FCMs need $20m min to operate - and that can't be used for any operational aspects, it just sits in an account.

What are your intentions for the 1m BTC you've accumulated?
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:04:31
I simplified, but yes miners do not decide on their own since they need the so called economic majority to accept their coins.
Regardless, the point is that XT is Bitcoin since BIP101 is consensus compatible as it stands today. It *might* not be Bitcoin under certain scenarios that could happen in the future, but that's just speculation at this point.
@_date: 2015-09-01 22:49:21
Bitcoin [REDACTED] is Bitcoin Core 11 + BIP101 and ~5 other non-consensus changes. I'd link you to it but there's no point since it'll just get deleted - google for Bitcoin [REDACTED]

Also, Patrick's talk should not imply that Bitcoin dies, merely that it becomes more expensive to run a full node in countries where bandwidth doesn't grow at the increase in stored data rate. Right now, the average person on the planet is incapable of supporting a full node since most of the world doesn't have a computer or an internet connection - clearly averages are not the most important factor to Bitcoin growth.
With that said, I'll agree that average bandwidth cost not keeping up with Bitcoin is not a good thing, but it's not a death knell either.

No one besides you has suggested that any of the core devs should remove their commit privs because they contribute to another project.
@_date: 2015-09-10 23:33:19
Great analysis here Bob. Can't wait to see further thoughts on this.
@_date: 2015-09-07 23:52:18
MIT thinks that Gavin is important enough to keep on their payroll - funny that for a guy that you think is "actively undermining Bitcoin."
He's earned his role just as the other core committers have. The fact that you don't like BIP101 or his contribution to XT is not relevant to his role as a Bitcoin Core committer.

Downvoted for excessive use of caps-lock. Dude...take some yoga or go for a jog before posting.
Sidechains currently are centralized - your bitcoins can be spent with the keys held by the federated servers. Eventually I imagine that this will be resolved where the federated servers won't be needed.
Lightning network is not anything. It's an idea. We have no idea how it'll work in practice. Maybe the most efficient way to use LN is to have a single massive company with 1M BTC locked up in a hotwallet. We really have no idea the centralizing/decentralizing effects for a service that has not be finalized nor is in use yet.

Yup. I unsubscribed about a month ago - I can skim it when I feel like it but it's no longer a critical source to get information from.
@_date: 2015-09-16 00:25:21
I'm not a huge fan of blockchain.info and agree that it's not exactly without blemishes, however why not list it and make a note "has been breached" or whatnot. It's not like Bitcoin.org had some "don't trust Gox" banner during the latter half of 2013 when something was clearly wrong.
Fair point about Theymos not being related to this decision, but you get my point. Suppressing information feels wrong, especially given the nature of bitcoin - I'd rather be given the facts and get to make my own decision.
EDIT: (I upvoted your response btw)
@_date: 2015-09-20 18:19:40
I'm presuming you mean that an attacker who isolates a node would be able to attempt to trick an XT node? Not sure that I agree with this statement. Care to explain under what scenarios you can attack my XT nodes and cause something negative to happen for either myself or the network?
@_date: 2015-09-15 22:13:19
Yup - I've never had a BTCJam account either - I was a recipient.
@_date: 2015-09-02 01:05:32
This. The letter has all the conviction of milquetoast. I'm surprised Gavin and Hearn didn't sign it for all the statement it makes.
@_date: 2015-09-07 18:12:03
Because that would somehow help bitcoin? You have to really be hateful to want one of the largest contributors to Bitcoin to walk away.
I might not agree with the direction of development that many devs have, but I sure as hell don't want them to walk away. If anything, I'd rather they tone down the language represented in posts...similar to this one.
@_date: 2015-09-15 22:51:54
It shows that theymos has power, knows that he has power and likes to use it to push his ideology. If he were a core dev, I'd be fine with him expressing his ideology through his arguments for or against a change to Bitcoin. The problem is that he is an arbitrator over a supposedly neutral communication medium and this is where he comes at odds with many members of the community, which he clearly doesn't care about. 
@_date: 2015-09-12 21:22:19
Large mining pools attempting to optimize connections to each other is already being done. If you want to work on that problem, fine, but block size isn't the answer since this is already being done today.
There's nothing wrong with making super fast connections - the key is to make this accessible to a wide population of would be miners, both large and small.

Conversations are what these conferences about - it's just a more human interactive version of what already goes on via IRC.
@_date: 2015-09-12 21:30:56
You're definitely twisting words here and will get downvoted because of it.
And you're plain wrong when it comes to it not being possible to have a discussion, compromise or agreement - people argue all day long about whether or not bitcoin could face regulatory pressure right now or not. Like it or not, this is what bitcoin is all about - collaborating with people that don't agree with your perspective.

Your loss! The content on LTB is excellent, the interviews (often) sound very professional and they don't ask softball questions. If something is controversial or interesting, they'll ask questions that get right to the heart of the matter.
Not only is it one of the podcasts I listen to the most, they've made a game out of earning LTBCoin which is perfect, since I don't care about the monetary value as much as I do the experience.
@_date: 2015-09-12 21:19:28
Not exactly accurate. His paper does take into account lower orphan risks - it says that if this happens it lowers the cost of producing lower blocks and drives fee cost down, which in turn would allow for more throughput.
The argument here is that it's fine to keep block size limited to what technology can support (stopping attacks and spam) but not for the purpose of driving the fee market up.
@_date: 2015-11-16 03:18:27
Downvoted for the troll / flamebait in your title alone. Hint - if you want to get people to understand your point, it's best to not belittle the opposition viewpoint by using the term "fans".
@_date: 2015-11-15 15:55:39
I was affected. Had a standing limit filled about $100 above market, bought right back in and had my trade reversed like everyone else affected.
I just got filled  about $30 above market for other exchanges. If this trade gets reversed too, I'm not going to be pleased.
@_date: 2015-09-07 11:29:35
I don't think that LTB is flat out wrong with the idea that tokens can be useful in microsystems. While I definitely agree that there will be  a single universal cryptocurrency there will continue to be situations where it's not the primary token of value.
Here are examples of 'currencies' already in use which have value only because the participant has no choice but to use them:
* WoW gold
* American Airlines points
* Chuck E Cheese tokens
Obviously outside of World of Warcraft, in-game tokens aren't much use. But the point is that if you can make your brand and environment valuable enough, you can make your own token valuable too.
A Facebook coin would at least temporarily be far more popular than Bitcoin, simply because they have 1bn users and can use that environment to bootstrap the value of a token. Long term, I imagine that the rules that Facebook would need to introduce would erode the value vs Bitcoin.
BTW, I still have a bunch of LTBCoin. Just waiting for some reason to spend them on LTB stuff...Adam - make some t-shirts or mugs!
@_date: 2015-09-14 23:00:50
At some point the sun explodes and we all die too. :)
I agree though - we should be working on initial sync and at least have a few proposals on how manage the bloat long term. In my mind, I feel that it's unrealistic to think that sharding won't come into play at point in the future.
@_date: 2015-11-30 21:55:46
It's the reason I pointed my miners at slush vs another pool. It's also a good reason to point your miners away from Eligius who doesn't give smaller miners a choice about supporting status quo vs BIP 101.
@_date: 2015-11-16 21:14:18
Other than the headline, this is a great comparison for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-23 14:44:10
Except if someone knows that you keep a lot of BTC on your phone, which you most definitely have with you all the time. At that point, you are one $5 wrench threat away from giving up your money - doesn't sound that safe to me.
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:18:31
That's great! I have zero skills so I probably couldn't make it 100 ft on a unicycle.

Just as angry as kramer without the entertainment factor.
@_date: 2015-03-04 19:35:05
I don't think that this is exactly a golden moment - more like a bronze one. Let's be realistic - the market cap for the BIT is around $30m. If 50% of sellers have held for 12 months and desire to sell, this is $15m in shares that will trade on the public markets. It's a good thing, but very, very small in comparison to financial products like a true ETF or derivatives.

| TLDR: Don't buy into this fungibility FUD and stop relying on third-parties for your Bitcoin business.
You sir, have never run a business if you think that it's easy to run one without relying upon 3rd parties. Businesses without bank accounts, payment processors are at a severe disadvantage to those that use these services, presuming that other competitors have these options available to them.
