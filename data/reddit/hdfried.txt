Quickest and fastest? Changelly. Youll get hosed with the fees/price but it meets your criteria.

That's just incorrect. It's a capital gain (if you sell it for a profit) and is taxable in the USA.

First off I'll assume you're in the USA. You'll need a 1099 but I doubt your exchange will provide one. This you need to basically figure out and get proof of how much you paid for the coin and then what you sold it for (all in USD). Stay consistent with where  you are sourcing this pricing info. You'll need to report this income as capital gain and as of now I believe you can report it the same way as if you were reporting stock gains. Disclaimer: IANATA

I can send you a screenshot of my kraken activity or my  Bitcoin address which you can check to see has btc in it. You could compare the two to in fact prove it's me sending from my kraken to my btc wallet. As for how much I'd charge, it'd likely depend on how much you want as well as what fee PayPal charges.
