To bad we still only have 3 places in NYC that accept btc.... We need more acceptance

To be honest I just added a node this weekend with my new build. Ive been involved with BTC so long its time to help it out with the little I can.

Steve jobs and Don Draper.... Who ever would of thought these two men would come together!
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:19:06
I wonder the same thing.... Is this man the only one out there that can contribute to the foundation? There were so many more people who could of been appointed. Never bring someone in with a controversial past even ifs it not true. People who do not know about BTC will view it as a bad step and its already hard to get people on board. This does not help. 
@_date: 2014-05-13 14:48:03
I heard one might be opening in Tribeca thats about it. You should goto 40 Broad street to the Bitcoin Center you can sell your coins there for cash and it works great. They help you do it safely around many people.

The mining aspect of 21inc. is making me wonder if there are chips in almost every device we own how will the pool work? Will it be all centralized with them or can we choose where we mine? 51% attack?
@_date: 2015-05-30 12:41:44
Can you confirm if there is a real wood-chipper in OKCoin's HQ?
@_date: 2015-05-10 17:08:09
I'm thinking the news coming from Wall Street is causing this price increase... The OTC GBTC, Bitlicense, and Winkles ETF and platform. I dont think we are going to see $800-$1000 again but movement into the $400-$600 range may be possible. Either way its good to see movement up again and not this constant downtrend and doom news...

Looks like there testing the waters of the blockchain. Thats good to see they might one day want to embrace the blockchain.

Just because shareholders have the option to deposit and sell now means it will instantly happen... As long as the deposits came through the their brokerage accounts. 
@_date: 2015-05-18 20:10:30
51% attack? What mining pools are they going to offer? Cant be just one.... If all these devices are going to mine we need to see how it will mine.
@_date: 2015-05-07 22:51:57
This is great!
@_date: 2017-01-12 02:25:08
Agreed.... 
@_date: 2017-01-12 02:26:11
Lets not forget those exchanges are legit enterprises that may be why the price is higher then other exchanges....
@_date: 2017-01-12 02:27:32
Price went to high to quick.... China Govt saw the increase and made a statement including meeting with exchanges like BTCC.

Abra and Cash have been 100 times better then Coinbase. Surprised people still have Coinbase accounts...

We need to get both sides, devs from each project to discuss this among the users in BTC. I read many different explanations and different sides of each benefit and venerability with the fork. We should get everyone together and see where this goes. This is affecting everyone in the BTC community and is starting to look like politics running for office. It will be tough to decide where and when to have this discussion but if its possible it should be done. Allow the devs to explain their points in one place instead of twitter arguments and random reddit posts. Then the community will have a better understanding of what is going on and it allows us to make a decision on which project we should support. 
@_date: 2019-06-13 00:32:59
How did that work out for Lawnmower a few years ago... Coinbase bought them and shut it down.
@_date: 2015-08-14 17:04:03
I agree with you. I've been in BTC for a while now and started doing research on the Whaleclub. After this research I starting noticing that most people in Whaleclub are children of parents who are in the Illuminati. How did I get to this conclusion. Many years of research but it shows what they are doing is manipulating the masses of BTC. They want average investors to believe prices are going up when they dump and same when it goes down to buy. They are the main influence in the BTC market, not China or the economics of the world. I hope this message gets out to the masses before this is read so we can stop the manipulation and we can one day be millionaires by the way trade on exchanges. 
.....This message should self destruct in 30 minutes or less

By the time Quamtum Computers can break the encryption a new encryption will be written into Bitcoin. This has nothing to do with it. Maybe Bakkt futures caused this or just another downturn like we seen many many many many many many times before.

Bitcoin center and meetup are the two best places. In regards to accepting Bitcoin.... lol I still only know of old man hustle accepting btc and idk if EVR is even open anymore....

I don't believe this. If you were smart enough to earn 65 btc by now and installed teamviewer for another person to log in.....

I believe GBTC will be traded next week. If not next week hope the week after. If not the week after I promise they will trade in a month. If they don't trade in a month guaranteed they will be trading by 2016. If not by 2016 I know for a fact gbtc will be trading by the time we have a new president in the US office.

Things are definitely moving in the btc world. Banks, governments and investments are moving in. Is it something the community wants yes and no. But it will make things interesting.
@_date: 2015-04-29 11:11:50
Its just a matter of time when GBTC starts trading. Question is what will the bids be at after the first trade... Will wall street make btc go up or back into the abyss. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:22:42
Its been a bid for a few days now they pulled it this morning then added it back. Question is when trading starts will that trade hold. If it does btc should move up in price.
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:44:57
The price is high because its not being bought on exchanges that have no regulations watching over it. I doubt big investment companies will buy Bitcoin from BTC-e or OKCoin because of regulations in the US. When you have the opportunity to buy Bitcoins from a legal entity, Grayscale Investments, you pay a premium.

For Cisco and Qualcomm to get involved in this idea, there has to be something were not seeing... Everyone is talking about the miner but that's not the main focus. There has to be more information on the coding aspect and what it does that we cant do now with what we have.

If this is true we will see dumping on markets, but I still believe the bitcoin market is very strong. May just be a bump.. or a hole, whichever in the road if true.

Did some buys and sell to test the order book and be one of the first on the books. Definitely a great exchange and quick and fast. Lets see if we get some buying power out of it though.....

100% when BTC-e other than Gox was the only trading site without restrictions the risk was worth it, now with legit exchanges all over the world its not.
