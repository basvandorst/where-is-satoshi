There’s a guy in my office who is jealous. He’s pure green with envy because all he thinks about is money anyway. He shakes his head that anyone would buy bitcoin yet he checks the price every day to make sure of what I’m earning or not earning.  I never would tell them how many bitcoin I have, just that I have enough but not enough. I made the mistake of talking about it and probably never should have. People don’t have a freaking clue.

Obamacare was supposed to save us.  I guess we're supposed to forget all that and blame Trump.

You got it backwards. Capitalism has done far more for far more people. Immeasurabley more. Built Western Civilization.  You only notice the jealous losers.

Trump won 84% of counties. Trump wins aggregate popular vote if you don't include CA and NY. But on top of it all, we have 50 states, so therefore 50 popular votes. If you like popular votes, you should be happy each state gets one. 
@_date: 2017-01-09 01:58:07
Aggregate popular vote is the aggregation of the 50 popular votes into one.  
You seem to ignore the fact that we are 50 states, not just one state.  Hence 50 popular votes, not just one popular vote.

Right. Regulation of any type prevents issues of all types, and is the *only way* issues can be prevented.  When issues happen without regulation, regulation is the only way they get sorted out.  If we have regulations, no one will be able to figure out a way around them.  The people who write the regulations know what is best and do it with everything taken into consideration.  They don't do it to gain power for themselves.

My point is that Bitcoin is literally the only thing of its kind (of significant scale) in the world and we are saying we know when it's volatile.  We don't and can't.  We *really* don't know when anything is volatile; it is *always* relative.
And if we say that the Pound is volatile relative to Bitcoin, it's a worthless, meaningless statement.

Gayness isn’t genetic. 
It comes about in males by dominant emotional mothers and/or emotionally absent, disconnected fathers, resulting in feminized boys/men who seek their father in male relationships and don’t want to replace their mother with another woman.

You act like a fucking liar who tries to bury people in links to articles that don't affirm your point, but show it to be the lie that it is, even though the articles are written by leftists and activists.  Trans issues are not issues in real life - only on social media, because the left is just that SICK, and consumed with group identity and group think.  YOUR WORLD IS BUILT ON LIES.
