Okay, yes I️ agree I️ misused the word scam. I️ should have said, is it viable.

Not gonna click on the link, never heard of them so I’m gonna assume it’s a scam and keep away from them.

This has been speculated for a few months already and will most likely happen (even though it might fail big time). Anytime and anywhere there is money for Zuckerberg, you can bet he will be there. Crypto is no exception.

That it will be indeed.

Okay thank you!

As others have suggested, do you remember the name of the exchange or wallet that you stored your btc on? 
@_date: 2018-06-02 15:26:19
There were not a lot of wallets to choose from back then, do you recall signing up for anything or receiving some sort of code or long string of numbers? Or did you only input your email?

Be careful here, if you get messages from people trying to help be VERY CAREFUL. Some people will try to make you give them sensitive information that can make you lose all your btc.

Okay, awesome. Thanks. Any other safe alternatives or is this pretty much the go to place? 
@_date: 2017-09-01 22:11:52
Alright, thanks for the help.

Do you think it would be worthwhile to cancel the order then and pay $170 in Amazon to get it? I would be able to get it within 2 days on amazon.

So if I were to put $2000 worth of bitcoin onto Blockchain for about a month, should I be fine?

Awesome, thanks for clearing this stuff up for me! I appreciate it.
