pure bitcoin fees would only be like equivalent of 0.20$usd or so?  probably even cheaper if you lowered the fee.
so problem is a.) the exchange you are withdrawling from is adding their own fees
and b.) bitcoin fees are pretty linear so it gets more efficient if you move in bulk
that being said majority of your fees are coming from the exchange.
@_date: 2019-11-15 13:06:27
obviously if you're at risk of not paying rent probably shouldnt do it.
but you could also take a percent as an auto investment basically.
you could also set up some scripts so as soon as you get a transaction you can exchange it somewhere for usdt automatically or something. money is programable at a personal level now so you have control over risk adjustment etc

hey another person with a misleading clickbait title for their article. neat
@_date: 2019-11-11 15:49:19


and then you roll that back, exclude the transaction you dont like, and make new bigger chain.


you can do it on bitcoin too if an overwhelming majority of miners collaborated together.  you can technically increase block size and miner rewards and still be a soft fork.  this is why decentralization is important.
@_date: 2019-11-17 06:01:38
public key isnt known until its spent since people are using pay to public key hash people only know the hash.
that being said it only theortically makes it less safe as its still not easy to crack. there are lots of addresses with known public keys.
@_date: 2019-11-25 12:59:38
1. yes there is a main private key. all addresses and their private keys etc are derived from this master key
2.  there are more combinations than atoms in the universe so good luck guessing.  the amount of work done there would be more profitable mining
3. not increasing.  some use different lengths though.  someone else will need to answer this as i forget
4. if memory serves me well there are about 2000 words used.   the word is just convient for humans, actually only the first 4 letters are used.
5. all wallets, while nothing really stopping them, follow the same rule set defined in the bip
@_date: 2019-11-12 12:47:26
by seed i thought you meant bip39 recovery phrase
it has your private key, sure
@_date: 2019-11-15 01:45:53
use of qr code is probably just so you dont mess up the amount because they can put that in the url scheme.  i can easily imagine them getting a lot of support tickets for wrong amount entries and this would be them trying to help
any qrcode scanner will show you the uri which will have the address in there
@_date: 2019-11-11 22:44:55
nah prob long time ago.
can also just search "1 btc to euro" etc instead of "converter"
@_date: 2019-11-11 10:53:09
btw think you should look at nano, seems kind of close to what you're saying.  its dPoS so still has the problem i just mentioned
@_date: 2019-11-11 13:41:25
the random part.  you have no plan for that and thats a huge part.  whats the rule to stop someone from making millions of nodes or addresses to force themselves to be a majority of the block producers?
also just because there no rewards or fees doesn't mean there's no incentive to be a bad player.  
i see no defense of bad players
@_date: 2019-11-28 02:00:52
yeeep pretty much.  im like mid30s% win rate but way up over all.
it works out over time.  gotta not care too much when you get like 5+ loses in a row though.
@_date: 2019-11-11 11:05:37
then only miners are validating and you're trusting anything they say.  thats what full node is about.  being able to trust the current state is accurate.   whether you trust or not is up to you but obviously having many people verify is healthy
does my mom need a full node? probably not but there needs to be more than just a few people checking lol
@_date: 2019-11-25 04:07:12
depends on your strategy.  mines doing pretty good.

i would use nfc for a small lightning wallet for sure. obviously not for cold storage though
@_date: 2019-11-22 01:17:30
when you first installed you should have been given a list of words.  you can use that "seed" to move to a new wallet

did you know that internet packets only go up to about 1500 bytes each? we transfer big files now but the underlying protocol is still only 1500 per packet.
bitcoin is just a protocol.  people will build on top of that and make awesome shit.
lightning is amazeballs and just needs a bit more time for UX issues.
in the near future this will all be easy to use/idiot proof
@_date: 2019-11-11 10:51:01
this is why pos is shit though.
say for example binance holds 11m coins and they decide to be bad guys.
there's literally nothing you can do about it besides fork a new coin.
pow at least allows you to fight buy throwing more hash at it.
its a pretty big difference that should be obvious why pow is better in this case
@_date: 2019-11-22 01:01:28
lol its alllll good man.  and copay wallet is fine.  any explorer is fine.   try out blockstream
@_date: 2019-11-21 22:22:24
a confirmation is block depth so about every 10minutes (give.or take) it should go up.
only way for confirmations to stop going up is if the wallet is not on main chain or just bugged or whatwver because the bitcoin chain is def moving.
id try exporting keys and try a diff wallet?
before that though just look up your addresses on an explorer site
@_date: 2019-11-05 06:15:02
is this even a personal wallet? or an exchange wallet? i cant tell from screen shot.
while depending on inputs(or rather total bytes), you will probably be able to make a transaction well under $1
@_date: 2019-11-14 13:26:00
your private keys work for the same address on both chains
risk would be giving your private keys to an untrusted new wallet.   thus best way to claim would be to move real bitcoin to a new address after the fork, then import keys in the new coin's wallet
@_date: 2019-11-12 05:18:21
i think you can make small channels to the users and then just push to them.  take the tx fee out of their reward.
then you can adjust channel size if needed with splicing.
and i think this gets even more efficient with channel factories

@_date: 2019-11-12 03:47:04
you have to formulate your question to get good helpful responses is what im saying.
whats your flow? why is moving money to a bank easy? whats the UX thats missing in crypto?
i can boot up an app and purchase btc instantly.  i have to wait a smidge for a withdrawl(hour-ish).  so you don't wait for banks to confirm deposits etc?
spending btc is even easier. just scan and done. 
where do you see yourself getting hooked up?
the initial setup is annoying? withdrawing from exchange annoying? depositing to  exchange annoying? what's your use case?
or you just sad there's no insurance?  you can gain interest with things like blockfi.  btc can be viewed as an itself is an investment too so do you really requires interest rates?
@_date: 2019-11-26 03:20:48
If normal Bitcoin transaction you'll see it "processing" instantly.  But will be confirmed later  in a following block(10+ mins later)
So you at least know it's coming immediately 
If you use lightning network it's instant.
@_date: 2019-11-15 01:28:08

@_date: 2019-11-10 07:13:15
probably shouldnt include exchange fees in the equation to get better picture. (even though yes you may have to pay exchange fees)
but anyway bitcoin transaction costs are more or less flat (depending on byte size)  so if your spending $100 or $10,000 its about the same. at current rates a tramsaction is like 20 cents or so? so thats about 0.2% of your $100 bill.   credit cards and the like take their fees by percent thus costing the store more, which means they increase price on you.
also if you were to get your $100 of btc on lightning, youd have almost 0 transactions costs too
@_date: 2019-11-06 03:47:44

I don't use coinbase so I don't know how fast they are at updating you.
You should probably be using a personal wallet though
@_date: 2019-11-11 13:03:25
you said the top 1000 are block producers.
you also need something, work or stake.  if not i could just make a million addresses and be a bigger player.
i dont get why you keep saying everyone uses pow all willy nilly.  it takes work to do pow. if you just spread it around like a lottery its not pow because there's no work. the system you are describing is pos.. or maybe like proof of lottery or something crazy like that if you dont require holding. but again.. all someone needs to do then is make more wallets than others.
and yes nano is dpos with no fees or block rewards
@_date: 2019-11-11 10:39:56

because your headline makes people assume a bad outcome that puts fear and doubt into the stability of ln when (as you just said) could have been a made up story anyway.  even if it was real he tried to restore an old state which is counted as attempted fraud and coins released to other parties
so of course your headline is FUD.
@_date: 2019-11-10 05:43:26
the true answer is just LN.
there could be other side chain solutions but def dont need it to be another entire new coin.
there are also stuff like wrapped btc on eth etc.  but seriously all the TPS noise is solved by LN
@_date: 2019-11-05 13:28:24
isnt that position size?  thus a 1mil liquidation of 100x leverage position means 10k down the drain, not 1mil.
@_date: 2019-11-11 11:00:41
pos doesnt have to get rewarded. why you think that is a requirement?
its just the people who make blocks need to be holding.  which is what you are saying, so you're talking about pos not pow. 
nano doesnt have block rewards either.
you're trying to change pow while saying pow is better.  pow requires work. your idea has no work
@_date: 2019-11-11 01:48:00

you can roll back and change because your chain is the longest
can make a local chain thats long but dont broadcast, make a transaction on other chain then after you receive your goods broadcast your better chain
you can also just keep rejecting transactions you dont want which leads to censorship and soft forks.
with a soft fork you could make a new blockspace that basically gives the producer new coins or a producer tax.  the new coins wouldnt be spendable like normal but if you force everyone to accept your soft fork then you can.
@_date: 2019-11-24 02:49:55

@_date: 2019-11-29 15:54:05

this robinhood?
they had that 18k wick a few days ago too.  im just gonna assume its bugged
@_date: 2019-10-31 04:12:23
you decide what rules you like.  if no one follows the miners then theyre wasting energy to mine worthless coins on a worthless chain.  they need to convince people to switch. thus for example, giving themselves a pay raise would be pretty tough.
miners can introduce softforks though since soft forks are seen as legit to all nodes.
this softfork would be an option because other miners may not be using it
if a vast number of miners collaborated they could technically enforce softforks by rejecting chains that dont use the new feature and since theyre majority theyll always be longest chain.
so like in theory a majorty of miners could enforce a minimum tx fee thus increase their pay.
sounds scary but the flip side of that is non-miners(who out number miners)  could just introduce code changes to punish them

@_date: 2019-10-28 02:51:27
seeing as how bitcoin continues to evolve, something will become the standard for sub-sat transactions.  lightning or some side chain etc.  
i mean technically you can live purely on lightning now... just the initial transaction fee of on chain channel creation.   but even if that price becomes something crazy im sure some solution will come along.
@_date: 2019-10-31 03:44:56
no idea who that is but sounds like you should go for it
@_date: 2019-10-31 14:03:56
you have to beat the taker/maker fees which, depending on the place, are something like 0.025% to 0.075% 
they ding ya on the entry and exit too so its double that so you're looking to need to beat 0.15%.
thus if buy in was at 10,000 it would need to be 10,015 to break even
this is assuming a 1x leverage
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:25:59
would push notifications work?
you could get something like PushOver and have the wallet send you updates.
i used to do that every time i got a stake reward on shitcoins.
never looked up how to do sms /shrug
edit: ah you want to be able to send messages to query wallet.  
that case i would just make a telegram bot that could query the wallet.
not saying better than sms or whatever as i dont know just saying how i would make it. but since node already hosted on vps it would add literally 0 cost to run
@_date: 2019-10-29 01:09:46

but i mean.. knowing people are the way they are sadly custodial solutions will always be a thing

@_date: 2019-12-02 01:03:08
for me and you? sure.
is that enough for miner incentives? i dont know maybe?
the thing with per byte rates is its cheaper in bulk right?
if i send 10-20k to an exchange for say a dollar, i consider that super cheap. (0.01%?)
now if i pay a dollar to buy a coffee? i would consider that expensive(20-50%?)
but besides block size i would also consider the block interval of 10mins too long to buy coffee, so obviously the current system doesnt help there nor would decreasing fees.
so again, we're left with building something on top for smaller purchases/speed

@_date: 2019-12-13 18:24:46
well then you're talking about a massive reorg  if the miners want to remove the initial receiving transactions that person received.  theyd have to remine days/weeks/months/years worth of blocks  to catch up to and pass the current chain.   which if was possible the coin would be worthless anyway.  not to mention take years.   in order to do that they would need literally 100%.  and during the year+ of mining to reorg, the highest chain would be stuck.   if it was even slowly moving they would never catch up.
so then the chain is stuck(assuming difficulty is outrageously high).. then everyone would just fork to screw the miners and get the chain moving again. 
pretty far fetched.... what they would probably rather do is just not accept new txs from that address so they couldnt use the coins(censorship)...assuming they even know the person's addresses
@_date: 2019-12-08 22:56:31

@_date: 2019-12-21 12:56:04
you can already do exactly that.  but since you need btc chain as the itermediary youd have to make a new contract which defeats the point, thus routing is an easy and simple solution.
routing doesnt make it more convoluted it makes it way easier.
obviously if you didnt need btc inbetween you could connect directly.  which funny enough is how btc was originally as they had p2ip before p2pk
@_date: 2019-12-02 06:03:48
you said 51 attack to double spend on exchanges.  this implies sending coins to an exchange, selling, withdrawling and then erasing your original deposit.
this gets harder as block depth increases which is why exchanges could automatically increase the required confirmations based on if there is a hashrate spike etc.
thus just 51 is not enough and gets harder as it goes is all i was saying.
@_date: 2019-12-03 05:11:16

once you have majority you dont have to put anymore money in and no one else can challenge. pow you have to keep investing into as well as if other people join they have the ability to take away some percentage of the rewards from dominant miners
while there is the environmental arguement, everything besides that favors pow.

that bit about holding seems off.  holding for a year makes the investment change from short-term to long-term but its not a "taxable event"
only when its sold (in which case you use short or long tax%)

the leverage setting doesnt matter when you close your position.
all it does is increase your position amount with less initial funds when you enter.  so you put in $100 at 2x and you have a $200 position.
when you close the position or reduce it you're just selling that $200 so there is no leverage setting.

sounds like just a database of email to btc address?  that you have to send through their service?  so you need coins on their service? if it was just forwarding for me that might be slightly better but i highly doubt that. they want more people on their platform.
i assume theres an email sent if that email is not registered asking them to get registered.
did i get the jist?  amazing whats worthy of a patent.  seems like pretty basic stuff. " somebody sent you a present! join xyz to retrieve" sort of thing is everywhere already
as far as linking an address to me thats easy to read id rather use the easypaysy idea
(obviously that doesnt have the nocoiner hook though you could do with email but still)

segwit basically increased block size so more transactions can happen per block
exchanges have started being smarter with batched transactions
layer 2 solutions reduce required number of on chain transactions

miners have no way to take btc away.  its impossible.  only that person has the key to sign transactions.  they cant fake the signature with mining, all non-miners would reject it.
now someone could go to the person's house and try to force them..
if 100% of miners agree on something they can only do things like make a soft fork required etc.   also for example, enforce a minimum transaction fee.
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:44:41
i think if hash rate drops low enough to where an attack may happen, then people will just wait for more confirmations.  thus the UX would definitely decrease as you have to wait longer but can still hold off attacks.
bitcoin is super strong right now which is why we're normally fine with only 1 confirmation

i just want to use it at any store i go to rather than cashing out.

whew! good thing you marked out the code before posting
@_date: 2019-12-18 12:23:13
doesnt sound like it would do anything to me.
basicallys says the attacker needs to mine a block first then only release header.  that assumes other miners are only looking at the header. as well as it requires the attacker to make a legit block.  since they make a legit block its their reward anyway so its not like they're taking away something.  if they purposefully dont broadcast right away they only endanger themselves as they may not get the block via race conditions.
sounds retarded to me. correct me if im wrong

i dont get how they all seem to be getting behind this "bch can do 0conf" which is just crazy talk

stop setting your fee to 8$ then.
i sent 5 transactions yesterday that all made it on next block for 30 cents each.
obviously the next step would be exchanges offering an LN deposit. hopefully sometime in near future?  
got to understand the merits of smaller blocksizes. its not all negative.
will it increase someday? maybe? does it NEED to? probably not.
@_date: 2019-12-02 00:40:25
ya and block size was effectively increased since then ya? got your wish, cool.
just need to wait for exchanges to offer layer 2 then i guess? since you want it free ya?

just go download the source and have at it.  you can start your own chain and mine your own coins or just use testnet etc

neat but problem is rakuten does not have the correct permit yet thus you can not withdrawl your bitcoin.
maybe thats changed but pretty sure thats where theyre at.
that being said that also means you cant spend it on their shopping site.
kind of a bummer since theyre the same company(even converting to rakuten points would be useful but you can only convert points to btc)
one would hope if they get that license then they will open the doors to using it?
that being said.. while i havent looked it up i bet LINE is in the same boat. they have an exchange app in their message app.. they also have LINE PAY to pay for stuff at stores.  so i hope theyll tie those two together but i bet its the same license problem.

you make a channel of 200k sats but you hold all the sats thus there is no room to receive.
you can spend as in purchase stuff, send some to a second LN wallet you own,  or do whats refered to as a submarine swap or loop-out.
the swap is basically you spending X sats on LN to get a payment back on the main chain.  since you send through your channel to do this there will now be room to receive on that channel
@_date: 2019-12-09 04:32:09
well the question is if that guy can withdrawl or not.  if its still in the system the guy becomes a form of advertising cause he'll brag he doubled.
also they may let ya withdrawl once but then stop once you deposit more etc.
point is 15% a month is crazy.  put that in a compound interest calculator and you'll see you can become a millionaire with a small amount of money in small amount of time.

i grew up in the usa so everything in my mind was usd.
i moved to japan and for a long time i had to convert everything back to usd in my head to get a feel for worth.
now after 10+ years i mainly think in yen.
but its not like i totally forgot about usd.. but yen pops in my head first.
i assume btc will be like that.  right now im converting in my head a lot but the hope would be that as adoption grows the thought process would be more in btc.
thats a pretty long way away though if that ever happens so you'll probably always be thinking in terms of whatever you get paid in and do daily shopping in.

i think acinq will push a turbo channel on to you if you are receiving payment(minus some for channel fees etc).  not sure if that wallet is released yet or not but the video looked promising.

just go into cryptography then i would say as a fellow CS graduate.
id be skeptical of courses like this.. like even if ya do learn a thing or two its probably not gonna be that indepth with the amount of time its listing.  
i think if you go in depth with cryptography along with normal CS stuff,  blockchain concepts would fall in line pretty easily.
if you want to show off to companies for job interviews makes some dapps or lapps  or even try to get some pull requests merged into core. think something tangible like that would go further, plus cryptography as a focus stands out more i think
@_date: 2019-12-08 13:44:10
its a two way contract so if you have 200k that means the other person has 800k.
so you would need to ask them to tie up 800k for your channel (they would probably just open a new channel to you)
