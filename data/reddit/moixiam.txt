It’s just fiat to BTC (at 4% fee), I wonder what the rate is...

Not exactly, Futures allow you to short BTC, you couldn’t long it, ETF’s will allow investors to long it (without physically owning it)
@_date: 2019-02-18 08:00:06
At what exchange rate?

The CME futures is what took BTC down more than a year ago.

Like who’s gonna want to even touch it? Crypto was created to do away with the banksters, to take away the intermediary, traditional banking is going away.
The internet changed ALL fields and occupations, banking is no different, now that people can transact without having to be at the mercy of the banks - it’s game over. Banking is going away.

Facebook silencing bitcoin awhile coming out with their Shitcoin for a cryptocurrency, FB is the domain of old people, no youngster has an account, it’s done for, goodbye ��

Private banks means - privately owned central banks.
The central banks are not regulated by the government, they own the government.
USDT is a shitcoin that’s involved with shady management.
Cryptocurrency doesn’t have to be USDT, it could be BTC, ETH, XMR, DASH and others.
Bolivar is an attempt in the right direction, I hope Moduro can make it happen.
The last one to try (khadafi) didn’t last long.
People need to get away from banks in general, be your own bank.
@_date: 2019-01-13 16:05:56
Why is the bank still allowed to exist amidst this colossal failure? It’s time to do away with the privately owned banks.

It’s not if or even when, but rather - how soon.

It’s NOT the only way, cryptocurrency is another (and proffered way), circumvent the banking system altogether. Transfer value and transact directly.
If people adopt cryptocurrency - inflation will not happen.
Algorithms (unlike people) do not take bribes and are not corrupt.

When the market cap rises BTC dominance is declining, meaning that you would actually have less than $600k BTC at 10 trillion

There are pre paid cards out there where you deposit cryptocurrency and swipe it at any credit card terminal

There are many YouTube channels that report and TA, FA etc... I recommend datadash for starters, nick is a pro

Your money is gone. Move on, use a reputable exchange next time, and do NOT use yobit the exchange ever.
