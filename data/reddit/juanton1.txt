what if it's a business that requires identity verification for purchase of goods or services?
but if you have insight with your assumption, please share.
i want insight on real time fees paid to miners for normal payment time and more bespoke services for converting if any exist. I see blockchain as a really efficient way to link inventories and ledger systems.

large business using wire and ach between accounts likely takes longer. even at a personal level, wires typically take 2-3 days. ach is one day, but no business at scale is doing that.
i'm wondering if removing friction between approval process at a company and initiating  wire transfer can lead to savings. or if it's just more efficient. measured only by transaction fees. So I'm completely ignoring market volatility.

So a consumer is expected to go out of his way to obtain this arcane currency, likely is up-charged along the way, and receives no savings? Zero sum.
Coinbase has advertised 0% merchant servicing. I am trying to determine if there are hidden fees, conversion fees, etc. as I do not use it.

but then it's an added tax on consumer, more reluctance to switch, unless vendors offer cheaper goods to account for savings on merchant processing. seems zero sum. maybe some utility linking ledger systems for b2b?
is coinbase really offer 100% free processing? So you can charge $49.81 worth of btc, and the next day there is $49.81 in your bank account?
