Anytime about now
@_date: 2019-07-09 00:01:05
Which will happen soon enough ��
@_date: 2019-07-01 07:52:15
I would definitely not say ‘every bull run’ starts with that.
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:06:13
Or a result of their recent hefty money laundering scandal.
@_date: 2019-07-03 23:40:49
Pfft. Bitcoin does whatever it wants!
@_date: 2019-07-08 03:23:49
This. Just because the price is not being currently influenced dramatically does not mean people aren’t buying in bulk. Many are accumulating OTC which does not affect the retail price on exchanges. Once the accumulation phase is over, currently at 17M/21M circulating, and the fiat economy really starts to fuck out in the next year or two, it will be verrrry interesting times.

Why does the hashrate go up and down so violently?
@_date: 2019-07-03 01:01:04
Same bro
@_date: 2018-09-19 22:50:47
Yeah its really getting frustrating. I guess thats what the SEC is working towards eliminating ����‍♂️
@_date: 2018-09-06 08:55:21
True 
@_date: 2018-09-21 08:28:52
$19billion added to the market in the past 24hours, majority of that being even in the past 12hours
@_date: 2018-09-21 08:28:08
Here we goooooo!
@_date: 2018-09-29 07:53:17
Why the hell only $10 lol?
@_date: 2019-03-21 22:36:41
Wouldn’t it be a little difficult because there aren’t many scholarly articles written about blockchain and cryptocurrency atm?
@_date: 2019-03-26 10:38:11
You need longer sentences 
@_date: 2018-06-29 09:33:57
No doubt a bank is going to say that bullshit.
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:29:44
Nah man, its fast becoming a reputable asset to just continue to hold and use.
@_date: 2019-08-25 09:00:02
Which is?
@_date: 2019-08-07 14:12:50
Omfg. Are we safe anywhere or what ffs
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:29:03
I feel like they definitely manipulate the market to suit their benefit in liquidated leverages...
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:09:55
@_date: 2019-08-08 01:27:23
I thought global debt was at like $247 trillion
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:30:44
@_date: 2018-06-27 09:05:20
Yes, and also I have bottomed, if you know what I mean ;)
@_date: 2019-08-06 08:19:43
It’s obviously going to be blockchain tech.. which means good for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-06-28 22:14:16
No. Bitcoin core is the core of BTC networks main secondary core supporting the network. BCH is the direct opposite of what the BCT core is for and the Bitcoin cash protocol core is not the same either. In essence it is downloadable as a Bitcoin Core and BCH Core fame work utility, but no node is called a Bitcoin Cash and a Bitcoin core FYI.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:37:31
Stop fucking selling unless you literally need the dollar bills. Just hold until soon you can buy the everyday shit you need to buy with crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-24 03:39:05
True points. Should cash out the minimum you need to though. Good luck.
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:01:40
Man, you clearly arent in this for the tech and the initial purpose of Bitcoin... *massive fucking facepalm* 
Just hold your mother fucking bitcoin and spend it as money very shortly.
@_date: 2019-06-17 23:29:27
Make sure to tell them YES to buy and NO to cashing out! Remind them of the digital currency that it is and that soon you can spend it on whatever!!!!!
@_date: 2019-06-23 23:06:42
Not necessarily as there is proven wash trading to pump up the volume.
@_date: 2019-06-24 03:33:52
Puuump and duuuump
@_date: 2019-06-17 19:56:32
Maybe you could pay them off with Bitcoin at some point?
@_date: 2019-06-13 05:51:39
The time is significant ��
@_date: 2019-10-31 18:04:58
Is there one like this for Spain or Europe in general?
@_date: 2019-06-17 08:06:55
You clearly dont understand and appreciate Bitcoins intentions as a digital 2nd generation type currency if you just want to ‘cash it out’ at some point. Potentially you may have debts in cash to pay which is fine I get that but otherwise we should all be holding and paying peer to peer while the infrastructure is currently being built to end up being able to pay with everything!
@_date: 2019-08-05 03:56:26
The other week I saw Bitcoin hit $11,111 at 11.11am
@_date: 2019-06-07 05:47:43
Holiest of holy
@_date: 2019-06-10 08:46:53
What trends that occurred in the past is not always what will happen in current days. The industry has matured so much in the past few years. Nothing is the same.
@_date: 2019-06-14 21:21:58
Yes Coinbase just [announced]( they are expanding their crypto visa debit card to 5 EU nations!
@_date: 2019-06-13 09:35:52
Apple should integrate crypto wallets to their embedded pay-wave tech, and that would really fuck with crypto in a huge way.
@_date: 2019-06-09 23:15:24
But somehow the price just keeps dropping ffs
@_date: 2019-06-10 23:48:26
Title should have said “scheduled to discuss” not just “discuss” because that grammatically infers it is present/past tense..
@_date: 2019-06-27 10:34:53
I have the same problem as OP and just looked it up and it says unconfirmed. Has been 24 hours now. :/
@_date: 2019-06-10 23:50:04
It’s bitcoin.. it wont do whatever you think it will do. It does whatever the fuck it wants given its regulatory status!
@_date: 2019-06-10 22:13:31
I did ?
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:29:58
Why the fuck is USDT being bought right now? I don’t understand, am I missing something?
@_date: 2019-04-26 03:24:40
Screw you, bear!
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:19:52
Do you have to cash out? Just keep it and spend it one day once it is available to use almost everywhere
@_date: 2019-06-11 12:04:56
The payment is seen in your wallet almost instantly so what does it matter that just now it isnt confirmed for minutes later? Did you really need those BTC to be absolutely confirmed instantly?
@_date: 2019-04-08 23:18:21
Omg such adoption!!
@_date: 2019-04-08 09:51:15
I want one too 
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:48:22
Someone recently just bought 20k BTC that pushed the price above 5k... and now 20k just got sold..same people?
@_date: 2019-04-25 22:35:32
Are they potentially selling BTC right now to get back the ‘lost’ $850m?
@_date: 2019-04-25 23:28:23
The arbitrage is enough to make at least a few million which is worth it IMO.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:50:33
Shame bitch!
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:34:50
I feel like he’s just being paid to do that by the banks and spread negativity :(
@_date: 2018-11-07 08:01:12
What the fuck Apple!?
@_date: 2018-11-26 22:10:42
Epic�� thanks man
@_date: 2018-11-20 20:22:47
I fucking bet they fucking knew the real date all along. Fucking pricks.
@_date: 2019-01-28 05:32:39
Maybe just some countries have agreements 
@_date: 2018-07-10 06:22:09
Fucking sigh. There goes billions from the market cap yet again..
@_date: 2018-07-10 09:55:04
@_date: 2018-07-28 21:13:41
I also have about 5 keys in my JAXX wallet. I had no idea all my separate transactions would lead to different adresses/keys until months after transaction. Is there a way to simplify this and merge all my separate transaction keys into just one? 
Eg i got .5btc, then .3, then .1 then .1 again.
I thought they would all have the same address and therefore same private key. But nooope.
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:50:30
Yeah the amount of profit they make is fucked. Like seriously its too much.
@_date: 2019-05-12 04:56:33
When office workers come back to the office and also jump in the good sentiment
@_date: 2019-05-26 23:05:53
Music to my eyes
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:45:18
I think hes just one in a long line of people being paid to shill crypto to keep the price down as long as possible but resistance is futile!
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:56:11
I hate him
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:05:37
Yeah. What the fuck?!?
@_date: 2019-05-12 23:26:01
What the fuck aye
@_date: 2019-05-09 06:20:35
What’s happening then?
@_date: 2019-05-09 06:18:51
Thats what they want you to believe, so they can continue to accumulate while hesitant people like that continue to miss out.
@_date: 2019-05-18 07:07:20
Yes but if it was going to be denied, why would they have delayed it for sooo long, and make a ‘major announcement’ for it to just get denied? Everything looks likely tbh
@_date: 2018-12-06 01:16:23
@_date: 2019-05-17 02:55:58
It is rather odd once bitfinex was halted, the market did great things, and now that they’re functional again, the price starts to get fucked up..
@_date: 2019-05-14 20:14:02
This is only mostly a correction from what happened in November, so basically any time is the right time to buy
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:09:37
Short term maybe. But this upwards movement recently has been THE longer term correction from the last big dump in Nov
@_date: 2019-05-18 07:17:46
@_date: 2019-05-12 10:16:28
@_date: 2019-05-15 00:57:53
Yeah for sure. Right now is just the start. Probably the personal money being invested of all the big dudes before the institutional money flows in.
@_date: 2019-05-22 10:46:18
@_date: 2019-05-12 23:26:19
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:08:42
Fuck these cunts aye! Fucking manipulating bastards. Im honestly sick of them.
