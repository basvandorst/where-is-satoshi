Whats the reason? Some news that I missed?

Ok, i get your point. I understand what the definition of "Market Cap" is. It says something about the current value. I agree.
What I am curious about is the difference between the Market Cap and the actual paid fiat money.
For example: someone bought 10 bitcoins for $ 400 and holds them until today. Today the value would be about $ 43000.
When the price of a coins explodes in a short time, there will be a big difference between the fiat money put in and the Market Cap.
I think that is valuable information, especially when you are an investor or want to invest in a coin.

Another question of a newbe here:
I created, in the best possible safe way, a paper wallet.
It gives me a public and a private key. I wrote them down on a peace of paper.
I then transferred some coins to my paper wallet using the public key.
I can check the balance of my account using different tools on the internet. Everything is ok.
But then I got insecure about my private key. Did I write it down precisely enough? Didn't I make any mistake?
My question: is there a(n offline) way to check the correctness of my private key?
What I don't want is to use an app or Desktop wallet. It needs my private key and I am not sure enough if that is safe.
Tips anyone ?

Thank you for your reply. 
That is exactly what I am doing right now, but I am looking for a sort of master overview where all the different features are in one list / excel / website. 
Features like hashing, way of proof, number of coins (pre)mined, etc in such a way that I can sort them in all kind of different ways.

That is the answer I was looking for !
(Also thanks to u/anestling for his/her explanation !)

Please, please, please take the time to understand what you are doing. 
Thirst rule of buying cryptocurries: always control your own private keys !
Never leave / store big amounts of coins at Exchanges !
Buy a hardware wallet or use a paper wallet. 
And if you don't know what I am talking about: please don't invest big amounts until you do understand. 
Good luck !

Can you determine in that open source code that you are the only one who knows the private key?
If thats the case I think you are safe.
I will make an other choice and will stick to my hardware and paper wallets.

These are so-called Hot Wallets. 
Fine to use for small amounts. 
For more serious amounts or long time investments I advise you to use cold wallets or hardware wallets. 
Don't take risks. 
Good luck !

Because you don't know if you are the only one with the private key.
