OMG better get in before it goes to $10T

Sorry for the noob question, but why can there be no other credible crypto-currency?
@_date: 2015-12-03 09:51:08
What happens to the existing BTCs, if other currencies come up? These fall in prices or do these become obsolete over a period of time?

Hi -  A few pesky questions fo ryou
1.  Do you have a conversion rate comparison in the "zoomed in" fashion to the INR? 
2. In your mind, would the volatile currencies like most EM currencies get a better valuation kicker out of BTC conversion? 
3. What is your business model, and what do you charge as a commission on the BTC-INR transactions? 
4. Is your company an essentially global company and would compete with all global players vs. India only players? If so, would your product have to be the best in the world for it to be taken up?
5. What happens to my BTC if your company dies, or goes away for whatever reason?

Democracy - I may agree with. If democracy means every one with a voice speaking up, and systems encouraging that participation, then it is very hard for any other place to be more boisterous compared to India. I don't think that it is necessarily a great thing though. Indian system is way too slow, compared to China and I would rather have development than democracy
Capitalism - Unsure. Corruption leads to very compromised capitalism, at best.

Well, firstly - when you put it like that - you are creating a false dichotomy.
I see corruption as a part of government failure and not a problem of those that do not comply. Government has to create rules and implement those so that there are massive financial and legal penalties. Since the rich and powerful can navigate around anything - it gives rise to a dirty environment.
@_date: 2017-08-22 17:12:07
Well I am definitely missing the point

As an investor myself, I am worried about one fundamental thing, and thought will check with you. Assuming BTC is a technology-finance adoption and knowledge game, the volumes over a period of time should be tracking an exponential curve. However, the volumes are flat to down. Does this worry you at all?
A couple of other simple questions - 
* What risks do you see in BTC?
* What play / thesis do you see building here - Currency like / Gold like / something else?

Indian rich is barely rich. In India, I hesitate to guess but no more than 10M people would even KNOW about BTC. 1M might know what it is, and 100K may actually have BTC.

Did you know that only 3% of Indians pay taxes? I am a small government kind of a guy, but the government needs money (and low leakage for sure) to be able to create infrastructure in the country. May be not all these stupid brown people are that stupid?

You had me there for a min. So, HODL?
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:32:31
You are right - but at ~$12B market cap it is not a lightweight either.
@_date: 2018-02-17 07:51:25
Sure, and "could" also lead others to book profits and sell. Are we really going to talk about all the coulds - now? At least talk about a high probability event.
@_date: 2018-07-23 20:38:11
Haha. No. hahahaha. Sorry!

Well, what they have done is (IMHO) saved a sure shot crisis by engaging into a longer term time bomb. It remains to be seen what will happen in the longer term. This is not unlike Chinese lending machine for the last 20 years. 
I think they are all believers in "in the long term, we are all dead" kind of solution. Let us just keep in mind, that while we can pat ourselves on the back for coming out of recession rather well without really fixing the problems (stupid banking structures, bad lending etc.) there is precedence on [financial indiscipline]( wiping out really strong empires in the long term.

* My base level question is how do I think about it - sometimes it feels like Gold, other times like a consumer product, other time like an equity share.
* Is this a B2C product (like a fiat currency) or a C2C product (like an equity share in the market)?
* Expected volatility range - why will it fluctuate more or why will it stabilize?
* If I think of this as a consumer product - what is the book value of this asset - i.e., how much does it cost to "create" a bitcoin? How has the trend on this price tag been evolving over time? What are the forecasts for the future?
* Sticking with the consumer products analogy - how has the consumer base been growing here? What about "same consumer" level growth? Has there been a lot of churn in the market?
* How much has actual consumption come out of BTC? Are most people using it to hoard or to spend? Are there any indications of big ticket items being purchased by these e.g., cars, homes, hospital bills? Most of the value of Gold in the world comes from the fact that it is both an investment item and a consumer product (~60% of Gold consumption in the world occurs from jewelry purchase by Indians and Chinese, especially during festivities). What is the consumption use case for BTC - if there is any!
* What are the various types of frauds that have occurred in the market and what are the fixes that have come in here?
At the highest level - as an investor - I would love to look at some serious investor's "financial model" for this investment. What are the fundamental assumptions around growth, liquidity and so on?
I can keep typing these all day, but would pause here, since no BTC enthusiast IRL has been able to answer my questions.

I know it is intuitively difficult to agree to a broader long term trend, when the 5 year trend is the other way around.
[Look at this chart]( - change the chart time variable to max and see the difference.
Also, please keep in mind the  rule  of economics is that more supply leads to lower price. Are you really challenging that?
@_date: 2015-10-12 07:06:28
1. Let me save this first.
2. You are really awesome. May be this is the kick I needed to really start digging in.
3. Thanks so much!

Yes, I am a classical guy. I want demand-supply, growth, margins - substitutes kind of satisfaction. I ~~cannot fucking stand~~ have only limited regard for technical analysis.
@_date: 2015-10-12 12:59:27
Ah very helpful! Thanks!
@_date: 2016-07-24 13:57:27
I am sold enough to have the same strategy. However, for me it is important (I don't know why) to have a process. I am ok with a thesis failure, or a failure despite my best attempt at a process, and am obviously ok with a success without a process (i.e., dumb luck). However, losses without process kill me, so need to do something about this real quick.

Thanks for the reply. BTC becoming 10% gold seems a bit aggressive assumption, given the history of gold. However, if you think this is going to be 50x+ (in 10+ years), then are you in the "any-price-sub-2000USD-is-a-good-price" camp?
If not, what is your process to determine a "good nuff" fall - is it % from the peak, % higher than previous trough, something completely different? Sorry, if this sounds too noob-ish.
@_date: 2016-07-24 13:49:11


May be you are right! However, in high volatility stocks or assets, I always feel nervous if I cannot figure out (at least roughly) the emotional bounds for the participants. Need some facts / hypothesis to go along with my faith.
