If you make massive gains though cashing some of that sh*t out isn't all that bad. If it all goes down that will be your house money and you will at least have made something.

Really? I think it just narrowed the wording which now makes it harder for people to do an in-kind trade type of thing.

I fucked up and kept my btc on electrum, so we're in the same boat. Fk Bcash though man it's nothing special.

This is a pump and dump scam. Do not buy into it because you will get burned.
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:07:54
Nah it had to be on the exchange

Actually hold up it ain't getting to 2600. Estimated the time in China wrong and it's already noon there. If it would be getting lower than 3300 it would have been at this phase in the morning. Don't think we'll see much movement beyond 3500

Honestly the big 3 are so low right now...I'd recommend investing in all atm
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:31:20
Yeah sorry. It's 3 am here and I'm up all night doing college homework rip me
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:52:23
LOL isn't CA even worse than NY?

People are fearful right now as the price is falling. Because people are fearful, you should be greedy. The people on this forum knows whaddup the majority of these "investors" don't have a clue and are actually scared.

Yes how much further is the question. I'm guessing 2600

Long-Term vs. Short-Term
Short-Term: You lose a a couple thousand of useless USD...so what...
Long-Term: Price of BTC shoots up to whatever you believe in
If you are bought into Bitcoin and are living comfortably and not in need of FIAT then the short-term doesn't matter.

Thanks that seems smart

Yeah I looked around and it looks like Aug. 31st is irrelevant. Although I wouldn't rly be that bullish on that prediction cuz the Chinese backstab.
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:35:51
Yep. I'm not in this thing for the short run so chipping in $20 a week seems like the right approach
