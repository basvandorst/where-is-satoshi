khm, steamstore-a.akamaihd.net. I can set up a domain as well and put some code on it. Unless it's on steam's domain or in actual client it's as real as fairy dust to me.
@_date: 2016-04-22 06:26:29
You're right, I totally missed that. In my defence I did search for the url last time and all I could find was a steam thread for a phishing attempt from that domain. Thanks.

This is just as much a rumour as that one was, even announced by the same group, in the same manner (screenshot) with no concrete proof.
@_date: 2016-04-22 06:13:32
All I have to believe is a screenshot. I can't get into the private steam thread to check. I tried searching through the code for those strings last time and could not find any - as could nobody else apparently, because nobody said how to find them anywhere. Since a screenshot could be made by anyone I cannot believe this is real until I see some concrete proof somewhere.
@_date: 2016-04-21 22:05:48
"Confirms"... and the proof is a freaking screenshot. *sigh*

Oh, another screenshot with no concrete source, so surprising!

Ah I see, I misunderstood. But in this case the electrum wallet doesn't contain any private key information so there's nothing needing encryption, correct?

Excellent, looks like they added that, and also fixed the hilarious 110% security level statement.

If I understand you correctly your 2. comment implies that deflation or inflation doesn't matter because with inflation you could cover the loss in value via interest, but I have not yet found a way that would cover inflation and leave me with risk-free, liquid funds. If you actually want to cover it 100% you need to either take on some risk or have the funds locked for an amount of time.
As for the 1. comment, I guess that's a valid point. I have never looked at it that way.
@_date: 2014-12-22 08:40:49
How do you mean password doesn't matter? If the wallet is encrypted you can't decrypt it without a password, but you can always restore from seed without a password, which works with electrum too.

Title is misleading. It should've been "if you are worried about your payments being double-spent", because if someone were to get over 50% it won't help you even if you wait indefinitely long.
Furthermore this probability is skewed by the fact you never really can be sure about the % of the network someone has. For example, if I had 50% and want to double spend a transaction right now, I would probably start building my chain "offline" and no one would even know I had 50% because none of those blocks would be broadcasted before it would be too late.
@_date: 2014-06-26 20:57:44
I don't know, is the information you gave to coinbase enough for someone to actually transfer money from your account? Because that's what it sounds like, and that's something that should not be possible to do. I guess what I'm trying to say is that any information needed by coinbase should not be enough for your account to be compromised in any way.

Obviously that's a fact but what you were actually trying to tell her is to take her 4k pounds out of whatever she invested in and put them into bitcoin, is that not correct? You also probably "forgot" to mention that had she invested 4k last december she would have less than 2k left right now. 
Investing based on past performance is a very bad practice that has made many people lost their savings. We all wish bitcoin the best but thinking rationally it should be considered a very risky investment and therefore should consist of a very small % of someone's portfolio. 4000 pounds is for many/most quite a decent sum of money, so unless you have several tens of thousands of pounds already invested in less risky investments I definitely wouldn't recommend investing that much into bitcoin.
Sorry for the wall of text. :)

I'm wondering how one would provide a "financial documentation" for mined coins. Many of the pools that were used a few years back are either gone or don't have any records for so far back, if mined solo those private keys are probably lost as well... I can totally see someone depositing such btc, not being able to prove they were not obtained illegally and thus locking himself out of the money. A very scary thought. (it makes me wonder what happened to the "innocent until proven guilty" logic)

The output script of the first transaction you mentioned indicates everyone with the data that hashes to 'f815b036d9bbbce5e9f2a00abd1bf3dc91e95510' can spend the money, in this case the address is completely irrelevant. It's not multisig, as far as I can tell.
@_date: 2014-07-03 14:13:18
Yes. Also, the time difference between this and the previous block is 17 seconds, so that might also be a reason.

I agree not creating backups is a big problem, but that will always be the case, no matter how secure you make your software. Multisig would (imho) still improve security by a lot by reducing the possibility of malware attacks.

It all depends on how much money we're talking about. If it's 100$ you're probably best off using online or mobile wallet for the convenience it gives you, if it's a couple of grand then you're probably look into an actual wallet like bitcoin-qt, electrum, armory, and if it's half a million then you're sure as hell make sure there's an air gap when you're dealing with bitcoin.

You can also just download and save the blockchain.info wallet page(s) for later use, since it's all javascript and it contains "restore from backup" feature and from there export individual private keys to pretty much every format. Something like wget would even do all the hard work for you.

Deflation promotes hoarding/saving while inflation promotes spending. Countries want you to spend your money thus they would like for it to be losing value over time. In the perfect world inflation would be the same as the % of economic growth as it would retain the same purchasing power.

I see. The 48 hour delay is a good tactic, but if you have to wait for a transactionwhy not just find some old unused computer to keep electrum transaction signing offline, that would only take you a few extra minutes not 48 hours, AND be safer. Combining that with a higher probability of an attack on coinbase (since they are a bigger target than a single person) I don't really see much upside.

He (and only he, that is, the payee) can, that's the beauty of this protocol (and the math in EC curve group in general).
So here's some math to explain the concept: let's say lower letters are private keys, caps are bitcoin addresses and same letters a and A are private key and corresponding address, respectively.
Payee picks A = a * G (G is the base point of EC curve), broadcasts A, payer picks B = b * G and calculates S = b * A = a * b * G. He uses X = A+Hash(S) * G as a pay-to address, sends funds and includes B in the transaction.
Payee scans the blockchain, finds B and calculates S = a * B = a * b * G, X=A+Hash(S) * G = (a+Hash(S)) * G, therefore the private key to X is a+Hash(S). He is the only one who knows a therefore the only one to know the private key. I hope this was not too difficult to follow.

I just tried to explain it to someone in another thread in two short paragraphs: 
I think this is how it's supposed to be - your picture states pretty much the same thing.
Btw, why is everyone so reluctant to use the same letters for corresponding private and public keys? This is the general rule in academia, for example in your case, using d and D instead of d and Q, because it makes it so much easier to read - whenever you see D you know d is the private key to D.
@_date: 2014-01-14 21:14:16
That is true. If business is conducted over a forum or e-mail, for example, this new protocol would make it a whole lot easier to stay hidden.

You could also buy bitcoin and invest into a mining operation, like petamine, for example. You earn dividends and still have shares to sell back in case you need the money (and hope the shares at least keep their value). 
I shall not comment on how smart or stupid that is though.
@_date: 2014-03-10 11:02:25


Not quite. You have several options:
* keep your money in savings account, provides high liquidity with no risk, but loses value over time
* invest your money into derivatives, provides high liquidity and high (expected!) return, but also relatively high risk
* put your money into fixed-term savings account, or invest into illiquid assets, provides high expected return, no or relatively low risk, but very low liquidity
In a nutshell, you can expect higher than inflation returns only if you take on some risk, or can part with the funds for a longer period of time. To me that makes perfect sense.

In your opinion, what exactly are they going to do when they surpass 50%?
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:55:19
The variance is obviously a big problem that can't be solved unless people move en masse, but I'm sure it would be just as good as any other centralized pool if it actually had 20 or 30%. 
I don't know the actual numbers but I think over a period of a month the high variance wouldn't matter much anymore.
Fwiw I think people will continue to mine in a pool that provides them low variance no matter how many of these "51% attack" threads are spammed on reddit, that is until an attack actually happens, and then they will fear for their profits and switch to p2pool. I hope this happens sooner rather than later.

Yeah, he's awesome.

Not much to elaborate. Paying to a bitcoin address and not the public key directly never reveals the public key of the payee until he/she spends the funds. After the funds are cleared it doesn't matter if the private key gets compromised.

I understand how a deterministic wallet works but this is not the problem, it's p2sh. Let me try to explain how this works. Lets say you try to send money from input A to address B. You would generate a script that says "you can spend this input if you provide signature corresponding to public key and address B", but you would actually broadcast a transaction that says "you can spend this if you provide a payment script that corresponds to hash("you can spend this input if you provide signature corresponding to public key and address B") and that payment script succeeds", and send the script to the payee. If the payee is an address in your own wallet you have to keep the script somewhere until those funds are spent. If you lose your wallet and have not backed it up at that point, all you can infer from the transaction itself is hash("you can spend this input if you provide signature corresponding to address B")" but since hashes are one way functions you don't know what the actual script (that you need to spend those funds) is.

There is no encryption in the protocol, be it symmetric or asymmetric. The only cryptographic algorithms used are ecdsa, sha256 and ripemd-160, and none of those are encryption algorithms.
It's important to know nothing in the protocol is encrypted as to not lead people into having a false sense of anonymity.

Supporting freedom or open source software has very little to do with what you actually use. Given two equally good apps I will pick the open source one in no time, but let's not fool ourselves, some apps are just better than others.

That's the problem with p2pool, the payout variance would go down, but the variance in your share submissions (what is used to determine what % of the payout you should get) would go up considerably. P2pool works well when there is a small subset of bitcoin hashrate (or you as a miner have a large piece of p2pool hashrate) mining on the p2pool sharechain, so everyone gets to submit shares frequently, but when that goes up you end up with the same problem you have mining bitcoin directly - albeit for a constant factor smaller. Having a big hashrate on p2pool would end up being terrible for small miners.
edit: for example, on a regular pool you would submit maybe one share every few seconds, on p2pool that may be once every few minutes or hours. If more hashrate is added to the pool that rate would further decrease, maybe to a point where you are expected to submit one share per month or even worse, and then you end up with a very similar situation as mining bitcoin without a pool.
TL;DR: p2pool works best when p2pool's hashrate is a fairly small part of bitcoin's hashrate and/or each p2pool participant's hashrate is a fairly large part of p2pool's hashrate.

@_date: 2014-02-09 11:58:46
Not really. 2-of-3 signatures with 1 private key for backup, 1 on a mobile device (without a password, "one click to confirm" kind of way) and one in regular software (encrypted) would go a very long way. This would directly counter 99% of these "I installed malware with this bitcoin miner and now I lost all my coins". Moreover you cannot count on people being smart about anything, most of all security.
I think precisely because computers are so hard to secure multisignature should be a priority right now. A payment protocol doesn't help you much if you lose your coins.

My advice would be to look at your portfolio as a whole, take 10% and put that into bitcoin (gradually distribute so that about half goes to low risk investments, 30% to medium risk and the rest you can put into high risk + bitcoin). If 22k$ is all the savings you have and you lose all of that you sure will miss it even if it doesn't look like that at this time.

Only the watch-only copy needs to be online, it's basically the same way trezor does things. The master private key can (and should) be kepts offline at all times. It isn't as quick to use and as user friendly as trezor but it's free and offers very similar levels of protection.


Sure, for 15k you might really want to invest into a trezor, but I wouldn't keep anything more than a few hundred bucks in an online wallet anyway, and 100$ to secure something like 1000$ is a big investment.

I wonder however, how the p2sh data is recovered if the backup is old, because the only data in the blockchain is the hash of the script and the script itself it somehow stored in the wallet.
Lets say you have addresses A, B, C in the copay wallet and want to move some funds from A to C, the wallet would make a script but spend to a hash(script), and the script itself is saved in the walled to be provided to the network when those funds are spent. If the wallet is lost at this point, how is the script recovered.

You can store your seed in multiple locations split into pieces with shamir's secret sharing scheme. On implementation of it is here:

I would disagree. This way they get bitcoins without having to deal with creating an account on an exchange, don't have to deal with bank wires and help people actually use their coins for something.

You are an asshole, aren't you? People use the word "wallet" for the actual wallet file as well as the software for using them. It's even in some of the names, like "Electrum Bitcoin Wallet". And if you really think you're so smart you're actually not, otherwise you'd know an address is a hash of the public key + few bits for error control and not the key pair.
OP, I hope people like won't deter you from being involved in the bitcoin community.

Ok so you're on tilt for using multibit and losing money to the change address bug, I get that, but it has very little to do with bitcoin. Just because one wallet is "broken" doesn't make it so for the rest of them. Honestly, not using deterministic wallets is anything but smart, imho.

I think so, I'm pretty happy with what I got out of it even though I never was really in it just for the money - otherwise I probably would not still be so active in the community - but it's difficult to completely shut that aspect of it out, even if you want to. I do envy those that can handle the pressure of holding such a wild asset though. I also quit playing poker for any serious money for the exact same reason :)

This is true, however nobody can prevent the merchant from re-broadcasting said transaction himself, making it persist in the network. Higher fee doesn't take precedence with two "colliding" transactions, received time does.

I know. Trezor is great but it's not exactly cheap. I wasn't talking about paper wallets.

As long as they are both available from the same place it doesn't really make a good 2 factor. Transitioning to 2-of-2 transactions, signing from a desktop wallet and from a phone would be much better.

Sure, but miners aren't the ones putting in relay rules. You can't just make it so that a transaction with a higher fee will override the one with no fee, because it won't even get relayed - unless you somehow connect directly to a miner that's willing to do that for you.

You are still able to track payments with these, the only difference is pay-to addresses would always be new (unless a malicious payer decided to spend several times to the same address) with payee only providing his address once. As I said above, I fail to see how this is beneficial except for payments like donations.

This is nothing new, all this has been know almost from the beginning - and absolutely no one is denying it.

I don't know your definition of "description" but the implementation specifics are pretty good description in my mind.
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:21:46
Payee gives out an address (only once for all future payments), payer picks a (presumably random) number and combines it with the given address to create a new one, which he then uses to pay to. He provides this number with the transaction so the payee can recreate the private key and spend the money. I hope this makes it clearer.
@_date: 2014-07-01 20:07:26
The "put someone else in control of them" might actually be a good idea which I'll think about. The main reason for stress with me was that I was not able to sell a portion of them at the 250$ peak (so 2 years back, i think) due to not being able to make an exchange account in time, and after that when they dropped to 50$ I was severely depressed for a while. Similar thing happened at the top of the last bubble after I was denied verification 2 times (for some bullshit reason, might I add) and only succeeded in the 3rd, but fortunately the plateau lasted long enough. You can imagine how stressful it is to hope for 2 weeks the price won't crash knowing full well I could've been verified a long time ago if I took some precautions. Anyway after that I just said to myself I'm not playing this game anymore and sold it all. 
However with the recent news of some more major players accepting bitcoin I think I'll buy some to spend and actually help the economy, looks like there are some local sellers on localbitcoins so I don't have to deal with the exchange bs this time.
@_date: 2014-04-12 16:23:26

Ah, that's true for pretty much all clients, but I don't see why that would be a problem, since it all happens behind the scenes anyway, *and* provides higher security in case an issue in ecdsa would be found. You can still re-use a receiving bitcoin address as many times as you wish though.

Actually, it does. I postponed buying a camera for 10 years because there was always a better model just around the corner. But of course, if you actually need something then deflation won't prevent you from buying it, that's why I don't believe in such a thing as a deflationary spiral. Mind you, by "promotes saving" I didn't mean "people will hoard the shit out of it", but that people will spend more of inflationary currency than deflationary, which is pretty logical.

Indeed, but the people living in countries that don't use metric units (americans, khem khem) are completely flabbergasted by the fact most of the world knows what metric prefixes mean.
There will surely be one that will say people don't know what micro means. As I am just reading my morning newspaper I opened to the technology section and there's an article about one of our institutes making some advancements in nanofiber technology, where both micro and nano are used. There's no explanation what those two prefixes mean.

I might have overstated it a bit, but metric prefixes have been in use for a long time and I think there would still be a higher % of people recognizing those than anything else we might use. A while back when proposals for changing the meaning of btc to 1/1000 of btc were popular I actually asked a few friends that have no idea what a bitcoin is how many mBTC would make one BTC and all said it would be 1000 without any hesitation at all.

These threads are completely pointless. It obviously is more convenient for miners and they obviously aren't worried about the 51% attack so there's really not much anyone can do about that - not until miners' view on the subject changes, which probably means an actual attack would do a lot more about remedying this than all these threads warning about it.
@_date: 2014-04-28 16:08:20
The problem is there's no priority in what nodes your client connects to. If it's trying to get 1000 blocks and connects to a throttled node you're going to wait forever unless you restart the client and get a better connection. At least that was the case a while ago, don't know if there have been any improvements since.

I understand that, but I think you're missing the point. The point is that with deterministic wallets you only need one backup ever, for as many bitcoin addresses you might want/need. It's a real pain in the ass if one has to back it up periodically.

Wallet keys (private keys) are very much like keys in real life. 
You say: I live at street x, number y and there is a post box. Mailman can deliver the post irrespectively of you having the key to your post box or not.

Mining is based on sha256, which is, so far, considered quantum-secure. So no, it wouldn't make any difference. And even if it did, the network would just readjust itself appropriately. Unless a constant-time algorithm is found it'll all be just dandy.
@_date: 2014-01-14 20:54:05
No, the payee will publishes address "12345" and you will generate a number so that joined with "12345" produces "AbCdE". You will pay to "AbCdE" and the payee will be able to figure out you paid to "AbCdE" and spend those funds. So in a nutshell if "12345" is publicly published no one will be able to figure out how many payments have been made to the payee - because they are not payed to "12345" at all. I hope that made sense.

Wouldn't really know as I haven't gone through all the "evidence". I don't think double spends would change many miners' minds because if it's not their money they're trying to double spend then why should they care. I think the only really catastrophic situation that would actually work would be a complete dos attack on the system - so basically someone with 50% just shutting down bitcoin completely. I'm pretty sure if that ever happens people will flock to p2pools and it would actually be the best thing for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-14 19:39:48
Does it really need to be encrypted? Because if it's just a part of a shared secret - the part that payee provides to the payer in the ecdh - nobody can really connect it to the final address without the payer's part of the shared secret. Anyway, thanks for correcting me, Peter. Love what you're doing for the community!

There was a discussion on the mailing list that throttling is actually worse for the network itself than not running a full node at all. This was, I believe, in response to a suggestion bitcoinqt should have an option for throttling built in the client.
I would love to run a full node, and I have until it became too stressful for my internet connection. My isp still uses adsl and 1 Mb/s up just won't cut it for bitcoin - apparently, that's the technology limit, so I can't get anything better. And I'm pretty sure there are many (in the btc community) that have even worse connection than I have.

There is absolutely no need to do any KYC for depositing money via a bank transfer (sepa/wire), since once the money's on your account it should have already been subjected to the appropriate KYC rules. At least that's how it was clarified to me by my bank.

I haven't yet tried it but from what I can understand once the nlocktime passes you input the transaction into gentle and it would output a private key and a raw transaction you can use to free the funds - so basically you broadcast the transaction and the funds would end up in the address associated with the private key you get. I think it looks trickier than it actually is.

2fa could be achieved with multisignature transactions, requiring two signatures, one from your desktop wallet and one from a mobile device (phone or custom hardware, maybe something that one could carry on a keychain).

Greenaddress.it is really interesting to me. The entire wallet runs using javascript (like blockchain.info), so they don't know your private keys, they use a deterministic wallet, so only one backup ever is required (in this case the mnemonic) and they sign every transaction with their own key so even if someone would get your mnemonic they would still need to verify with the website using 2fa to make a transaction. Also the situation where the website would suddenly disappear has been taken care of using nlocktime (basically after some time passes you wouldn't need their signature anymore).
Mind you I have NOT reviewed their code so I can't guarantee there's not something malicious going on.

Assuming sha256 is collision resistant, the probability of computing any two such messages with the same hash is practically zero. There is no way of knowing if in fact two such messages have been found, but the probability theory suggests they have not.
My cryptography professor used the following analogy: the chance of any two (random) messages out of a billion having the same hash is ~40 times less likely than a mass murdering meteor crashing to earth within the next second.
@_date: 2012-12-13 10:13:55
This in cryptography is called a collision. Hash functions are supposed to be collision resistant (meaning that if collisions do exist, it is very difficult to compute one), and sha256 is still thought to be such.

Yes, every transaction includes a link to the transaction funds came from, just look up any transaction on blockchain.info, notice the input fields.

There's a possibility of javascript on the blockchain website being compromised in a way that could steal your private keys. Something like that couldn't happen with electrum (worst case is you can get sent the wrong transaction data by a server, making your transactions invalid). Two factor auth will only prevent an attacker from being able to get to the encrypted backup of you wallet that blockchain.org saves for you, nothing more.
My suggestion: be very careful with blockchain. At the very least use some kind of js validation tool if you plan on keeping any larger amount of btc with them.

When you look at it like that, sure. But if someone was able to install a keylogger, he probably also would be able to get to the encrypted wallet, making 2 factor auth obsolete. What does help however is setting a second password that is asked of you when making a payment. This is actually used to doubly encrypt the wallet, making it more secure, in a way.
The way I see it 2 factor auth at blockchain.org does more bad than good, since it provides a false sense of security.

1. public key is provided with a signature, when it is required (when the input is spent).
2. there is no such check for uniqueness. Since the keyspace is so big the probability of getting a key that has already been used is practically (or, as roger ver would say, *mathematically*) zero.
3. addresses are public keys hashed with sha256 and ripemd160, respectively. Since this reduces the space from 256 bits (public key) to 160 bits, there is a (very slight) chance of having different keypairs that lead to the same address, in which case any of them can be used to spend those funds.

They want to provide services to people that are willing to pay with bitcoin. That's nothing but a good thing. A company needs a reliable source of income, holding bitcoins is everything else but reliable, no ceo in their right mind would want to do that (especially at this point in time). People that think everyone accepting bitcoin should also hold on to (all of) them should step out of their utopian bubble into the real world once in a while.
As a consumer I just want to pay with bitcoins, I don't give a damn if they want bitcoin or not, as long as I can use bitcoin the way it's meant to be used.

The idea behind certificates is pretty simple: there exist a central authority that verifies person's identity and signs it's public key + id info with their own. When a bank (or anyone else) gets your request for an account log in, they check your certificate and verify the CA signature. Since they trust the CA to do the id check they now know for certain it is you and not some imposter. That is why it is important for a CA to do an extensive check on people who sign up for a certificate and check they are who they really say they are. The only real way around this without a central authority is for everyone to personally (and in person!) check in with whoever they're doing business with, which obviously doesn't really work in the internet age.

Mining and the signature algorithm used in bitcoin are two completely different, unrelated things. The mining aspect only uses hash functions and is as such considered to be qc resistant.
As for different signature schemes apart from lamport, there aren't that many. Ntru is one of them, but is still under a patent, if I recall correctly, and even that one has a much, much higher keypair size than the currently implemented ecdsa.

Actually, appropriate key stretching would pretty much negate the inability for "humans to generate random numbers". With the ability of having a master public key pre-generated there really is no reason key stretching should be fast - even a second per calculation would probably still not hinder performance much.
I'm pretty sure there was a bounty on cracking one of the bip-(don't know the number) encrypted private keys that was about 5 characters long and it still took several days to crack, where in theory such a password is laughably insecure.

It is a big deal because as an individual (that is not running a business), you don't pay income tax on bitcoin-fiat exchange (as you do not with any other currency exchange as well). There's a list of such countries on bitcointalk and it isn't very large.

It requires a hard fork. It can't be quantum crypto (for obvious reasons), but rather classic crypto that is (supposedly) quantum-resistant (lamport signatures, for example).
As for the D-Wave, it's completely useless for breaking cryptography, because it doesn't work in the way required for that - but with something called quantum annealing.

The only way to be really sure your bitcoins won't be stolen is to store them in an offline wallet, and create transactions offline. Everything else is exploitable. Armory ( makes this pretty easy to do.
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:23:17
2FA is only an option when someone else is keeping bitcoins for you (like mt.gox). In that case they are a much bigger target than a single small bitcoin user's desktop. If they don't invest considerable amount of funds into making their system secure (which judging by recent events they really don't), they **will** get hacked eventually and then your 2FA won't save your bitcoins. The only secure method of protection is always keeping important information (private keys, in this case) offline.

That is the price you pay for being in control of your own money. You control them, you and you alone have to keep them safe. **Nothing** that is in digital form and connected to the network is safe.
Of course, you dont *have* to worry about security yourself if you don't want to, in that case you can leave your bitcoins in an mtgox account, for example, and they will keep them *safe* for you - but we all know that's not a very smart idea.

The majority of bitcoin clients are made in such a way they do not reuse addresses by default. What this means is, in order for an attacker to be able to get to your bitcoins three schemes have to be broken: ecdsa, ripemd-160 and sha256. If it were the case one of them is broken, there would be enought time to slowly phase in another scheme.

No, it's really not. In any case, I find these statements almost as hilarious as people not wanting to verify with exhanges and then running to the police when their btc's get stolen.
edit: I'll explain why I think litecoin is just as legit as bitcoin: bitcoin has a problem that the mining computations are too easily paralelised, therefore making it possible for a single entity to have a decent share of computing power, because the infrastructure for such algorithms is so easily extensible. Litecoin at least tries to improve on this, and anything that tries to solve any of bitcoin's "problems" is a step forward. 
I am not saying if someone were to copy the bitcoin code and call it something else it would be worth just as much as litecoin is.
We can all fool ourselves that bitcoin is the ultimate end-all currency, but there are still a lot of improvements to be made.
@_date: 2013-01-31 10:57:48

sha256 is fine, but ecdsa isn't - if you somehow got a hold of a public key tied to a specific address - be it by social engineering or by a nonempty address tied to a transaction used as an input, you could find a private key with a quantum computer. So it's not all that nice and dandy, but it's still a long way before quantum computers will be able to crack the ecdsa version bitcoin uses.

How difficult is it to replace the word "mathematically" with "practically"... Ah, in the end it's he who looks like a fool, so I guess I shouldn't really care.

All it takes is for someone to say "up up up is what I always say" on tv, and the whole thing will collapse, trust me. :)

I don't understand what's bothering you. You had 2 wallets, one with a password you don't know, and a backup with a different password you knew. You swapped the new wallet with the old backed up one, but now you're confused why the old password worked?

The only thing that really bothered me were the sponsors at the bottom left during the matches. They really could've shown those at the beginning and not let it hinder the rest of the game.
edit: oops, this was meant as a reply to coloRD, but no matter...

I see you're just like me. Mechanical keyboards are a thing of beauty, one can never own enough of them :D
I type on the Das Keyboard. Great stuff.

Apart from throwing around (in real life) nonsensical phrases like "mathematical impossibility" and using the word "impossible" in general a little bit too often I think Roger is doing a pretty decent job.
@_date: 2013-12-02 12:59:35
Good point. I hope they take your suggestions into account and implement them asap :)

I don't know how your bank's internet banking works but over here it's get a certificate or go personally to a bank for every transaction you do. Some banks also personally issue their own certificates but those also require to personally show at the bank and id yourself, so it's basically the same problem.

I want bitcoin to succeed just as much as the next guy, but trying to force it on people is counter productive, to say the least.

Too bad the network requirements are too harsh for those of us that don't have great internet.

He seriously needs to get punched in the face every time he uses this phrase... maybe that would teach him.

There are slovenian banks and there are (privately owned) banks that have a branch in slovenia. Slovenian banks are in trouble, unicredit is not.

Transactions are usually signed by the owner of it's inputs. If anything in the transaction is changed afterwards, it's signature will be invalid.

I don't see any mention of bitcoin on the site. I think OP might be full of shit.
@_date: 2013-02-19 15:45:47
Why would it? Tell her you have absolutely nothing to lose from this.

You can always export the private keys and import them in another client.

I think you misunderstood. (1. "post cointains proof" as in "there is proof in the thread op posted", 2. this is the op)

Yes, private key is all that is needed. It is not insecure if private key is kept hidden. And yes, private keys are almost always encrypted these days.
@_date: 2013-09-18 12:10:06
citation? (really, i'm curious)
I'm pretty sure encryption is based on the password, so with a strong password I don't see how it would be "cracked ridiculously quickly".
@_date: 2013-01-24 11:39:08
Unfortunately, in the eyes of other, non-technological people, yes, this is exactly what happens. Have you somehow missed the articles after the first big crash? Anyway, I'm not "the enemy" here. I truly believe bitcoin is an amazing technology and can succeed, but a series of bubbles certainly won't help.
@_date: 2013-03-10 10:07:00
Even if the creator owns 20% of all bitcoins, how would that constitute a ponzi scheme?
I would advice against investing heavily into bitcoin unless you can afford to lose it all. If you find it interesting just buy a few and spend them, then buy some more.
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:05:58
excellent, thank you!

You are correct, maybe I should've said "differentiating good investments from bad" instead, but as his father thinks bitcoin is a scam it seemed fitting.
