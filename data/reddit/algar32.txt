I'm not. People love to upvote things that go against the negative aspects of their subreddit. They upvote it because it makes them feel like they aren't "one of the bad guys" posting mindless drivel. When in reality, many of them probably are.
@_date: 2014-10-18 19:22:04
I think OP's point is pretty simple. If they started accepting bitcoins it would pull more donations. The press in this subreddit alone would bring additional money and it would not take them much time to setup.
I know it doesn't sound right and that people could just use exchanges, but this isn't a perfect world. Press and hype help sell an idea (although it is one that shouldn't have to be sold).

I was completely sober and decided to pour some drivel into the comment box. I wasn't planning on posting it, but I saw how artfully mangled it was and on a whim decided to proceed. 
@_date: 2014-12-06 04:03:55
The arrow you drew threw me for a bit. I kept trying to draw some kind of connection between a chicken and collecting tokens.

 I would rather support [qBittorent](
They already accept Bitcoin and are in my opinion the best torrenting software

Would something like blockchain.info be what I'm looking for?
I'm more familiar with the mcu side of things, so I'm a bit confused as to how I can pull this data from the web. Hopefully my further research will uncover how to go about this.
Thanks for the reply

You know it's Microsoft, right? I think your struggling to see the Forrest through the trees here
@_date: 2017-03-26 01:20:27
How delusional are you all really? I never thought I'd see Bitcoin turn into the Republicans vs. the Democrats, my team vs. your team. 
If you honestly believe that all of "the bad guys" support the opposite side, you may be beyond saving. Please think critically, please think pragmatically, please do not drown yourself in the drivel of the propaganda machines.

For real, people are so sad. Enjoy the coin you have and move on.

Lol, this got upvoted too. It's gotten worse here than I had remembered.
@_date: 2016-11-05 02:21:24
yeah, it would be helpful to compare btc against other coins that have technical advantages over bitcoin
@_date: 2016-11-01 19:05:07
As a giant whale, I'm glad someone appreciated this. It took me a while to get the shape right and it still didn't look quite as good as I would have liked.
Oh well, there is always next year!

The only device with a good enough camera to grab it is my phone, and flash stopped being supported on mobile years ago. 
@_date: 2016-09-17 13:05:02
That's a great question
@_date: 2016-09-17 00:38:30
yeah, I guess they did. I would have loved to have been able to use a phone.
@_date: 2016-09-17 15:32:27
Yeah, I'm not going to. Seems like they're a pretty terrible company. I used them back in the day because it happened to be the easiest at the time
@_date: 2018-03-01 02:51:28
Yeah, especially if we are using Bitcoin as a benchmark for decentralization. Relative to this, it's not too difficult imo.

Yup, that's my understanding of iota as well. Hopefully they can figure it out, but they've still yet to release any metric that would indicate the coo can be safely taken away
@_date: 2016-09-17 02:07:30
Yeah, it's ridiculous. I can't believe they don't let you use a phone
@_date: 2018-02-24 23:59:01

There are better ways then webcam auth via flash. 
Use just about anything other than flash. Something supported by mobile should be an obvious choice.

Many ICOs flop, but not all are scams. I bet most people wish they had invested in eth during its ICO (not suggesting tezos will have the same success)
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:04:09
 and where does that money come from? Do you really think that much new money is coming into BTC space just for this split?
@_date: 2017-07-22 21:51:37
You're proving my point^
@_date: 2017-07-09 23:05:05
concerned about censorship. I've seen it all!
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:44:19
Yeah, it's pretty bad. It's almost hard to tell if he is serious or if it's purposefully created as a satire account.
@_date: 2017-07-31 18:20:19
Sure, but they're also probably dumping BTC. The point we're making is that there is no significant source of new money coming into play during the split. Essentially, the pie of existing investors used to be all interested in BTC, but now a slice of that pie is leaving. They're taking some of the money from the pie of existing investors in the space. 
You can speculate on how substantial that will be, but I don't see a scenario where this money leaving  BTC will pump the value of BTC (at least in the short run)
