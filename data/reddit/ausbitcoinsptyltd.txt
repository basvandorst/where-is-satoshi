CoinJar just made an announcement too, as expected. It is not affecting individuals as some are speculating. NAB are mainly targeting legitimate, high volume crypto trading businesses.

There was no way NAB would have known the account was trading on LocalBitcoins. We keep insanely detailed records, ID my buyers not to mention it was a business account opened under a propriety limited company. How much more legitimate do we need to be, sorry?

The account closed was a business account. I called  NAB up for some clarification and individuals will not be affected unless a high amount of fraud occurs  It states on the letter that they are targeting crypto trading BUSINESSES.

If anything, I'd be surprised if many LocalBitcoins traders will be affected at all. The letter states that NAB is specifically targeting "businesses that trade in digital currencies". I also called the Resolutions Team and was told that yes it's a very new chance in stance, and my company won't be the only one receiving this notice, others have received it too and more are likely to follow. Funnily enough, they said smaller volume individual traders (the typical LocalBitcoins trader) aren't likely to be affected by this. So if not them, then I'd put my money on us hearing from the likes of CoinJar, Btrade as well, very soon.
EDIT: Not an isolated event. See CoinJar blog. They've received notice too.
