What are your sources? I don't get a lot of the things you stated for Mullvad.
Edit: Okay, I've just read 
Still, there are some things I don't really get. Why does not having a warrant canary get counted as something bad? Afaik, you can only be silenced when you are American. European agencies are not allowed to silence you. There's no equivalent of a "National Security Letter" here (PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong, but I've never heard of something like this in Europe.) So there's really no use to a warrant canary for Non-Americans.
P.S.: Mullvad is currently providing 16 servers:

Why is it a scam when it starts with already distributed coins? It's not like there was a pre-mine period like there was for Bitcoin Gold or some other crypto-currencies. Also, the folks who support BCH have been part of the BTC community before, so of course it makes sense to keep their balances instead of starting anew. For many BCH is what BTC should have become, so in their eyes BCH is an actual upgrade of BTC.

The thing with compression is that it does not work on random data.   
Bitcoin adresses are hashes of public keys. The output of modern cryptographic hashes is indistinguishable from random data. The same goes for public/private keys. So there is really no point for a compression algorithm to position the lever.

why should something that there is so much of in the world considered valuable at all?
it's like selling breathing air - people need it, but their demand is already settled. to make it valueable you would need to raise a monopoly on breathing air.

I feel like most of you focus too much on the currency aspect of bitcoin.
You don't need Bitcoin to pay something, to store or transfer value. There are alternatives for that.
What you NEED Bitcoin for - or in other words what you can't do without Bitcoin - is making transactions (of any possible kind) on the Bitcoin blockchain.
And for that you don't need a lot, only a few satoshis. So with theoretically 300,000 per living human being on earth (and not everyone will have a need for blockchain transactions) there is a huge excess of them.

the difference is, to achieve something with gold you need a certain amount of it. same goes for pizza - you need a certain amount to achieve the goal of becoming full.
to achieve a blockchain transaction you only need the smallest allowed unit (plus fee)
@_date: 2014-11-02 00:53:43
take the currency aspect out of it.
to commit a transaction on the bitcoin network you need a token.
this token can have an arbitrary value. considering the principle of greed people will chose the smallest possible amount - currently a satoshi.
the demand for making blockchain transactions can only be so high, but in theory you could make bitcoin ininitely more divisible - changing also the smallest amount people need to make a transaction.
therefore there is more supply than demand at any given point in time.
when we take the currency application into account things suddenly change, because people accept as currency whatever they perceive as valuable, even basically worhless paper.
but this probably comes down to the question of what bitcoin REALLY is - a transaction token or a unit of currency.

There is no advantage of holding one whole Bitcoin over holding a fraction except for being able to make more transactions on the network.

That doesn't make it the future of anything. It's just another concept to validate transactions and/or issue new coins to the stakeholders. Usually PoW currencies don't switch to PoS, and even if they do, it doesn't imply switching from a finite supply of coins to a infinte one. In PoW systems miners still get rewarded the transaction fees after coinbase rewards run out. PoS systems also have a system in place to reward their stakeholders after all coins have been issued. It's just two different approches, there's no chonological relation between the two.

That's not what I said. Demands are currently not growing at all (CPU time, bandwith) or linearly (storage). Technological growth however, is exponential and even currently available ressources are plenty for current demand.


You don't run a fullnode of your everyday desktop computer. It is already slowing down the CPU too much (if not restricted to certain cores, for example). CPU time however, is not the limiting factor for block size, network propagation time is.


You can run it on Raspnerry Pi or similar. Restrict bandwith and you're good to go. Storage is cheap. Block verification will take longer on slow CPUs, though.


It already costs almost nothing (for people living in developed countries) and we only have a few thousand nodes up worldwide. I don't think the amount of nodes is a problem correlated to block size.


I'm not sure what you mean by "gatekeepers". Nodes are already identifiable by their publicly announced IP adresses. I also don't see how bigger blocks have anything to do with decentralization.

The point I was trying to make is: We're already using dedicated devices, VPS or others, to run full nodes. The Bitcoin client slows down desktop machines since it's adoption first started to rise.   




That's kinda the libertarian/anarchist viewpoint that made Bitcoin succeed, isn't it?


I yet have to hear a single person complaining they won't be able to run a node in the future. Everyone who is running a node today will be able to run a node with a bigger block size.


If you're using a paid VPN, you won't have problems running a node with bigger blocks. TOR on the other hand might be a problem, although TOR's bandwith has also been increasing over the past few years. The question is how useful or wise it is to run a full node behind TOR. It would probably make more sense to implement e2e-encryption and connect to a few trusted peers, but this (e2e) is not implemented yet.


CPU time becomes a limiting factor as soon as you can't verify blocks in a timely manner anymore. Even with exponential growth of CPU demand (which I might fail to see here), I don't think that will ever be the case on a average device when there's exponential growth of CPUs at the same time.   
Will I be able to verify the blocks faster then they appear on a Nokia 3310? Most probably not. However, I don't think we should settle on the lowest denominator. (It's basically the same as stopping to write more complex software because some Intel Pentium 3 with 900MHz will not be able to run it anymore.)


Since the high fees/long wating times it doesn't even stronly appeal to me anymore, someone who has been around since the very beginning late 2009. We'd see an increase in adoption if we we're able to lower the fees and confirmation times, which would happen if we increased the block size. As far as I can see, (reasonably) bigger blocks don't break anything, but will bring more people to the table.


Precious metals were once used very vividly by "the masses". But this whole parapragh seems pointless to me.


That cost however, is currently unaffordable for estimated one half of the planet and unappealing for most of the other half. Even if it was appealing to them, there isn't enough throughput with the current 1MB system for even remotely all of them. Also, I still don't think there are technical limitations that prevent bigger transaction throughput achieved by a bigger or flexible maximum block size. If you can point out a big enough set of voices in the community that complain they aren't able/won't be able anymore to run nodes because of a bigger block size I might change my view on this. (Chinese miners were already signaling reasonably bigger blocks, up to 8MB I guess, were okay with them.)

I don't see Bitcoin anywhere. Is it US-only?
@_date: 2015-09-13 13:28:03
not exactly. transfer rates usually use 1000 as magnitudes and bit as unit while disk space typically uses 1024 and byte.
for example DSL 32k means downspeed of 32000 kilobit/s. (32x1000x1000 bit/s)   
a 4MegaByte (actually called MebiByte) file is not 4x1000x1000x8 bit but rather 4x1024x1024x8 bit.   
so the download time for the 4mb file is not 1 second but 1.048576 seconds.
I know this is a bit offtopic, just wanted to get it right. (btw, this is the main reason why your "1TB" drive has actually a lot less usable space)

It doesn't fork away from Bitcoin, it becomes Bitcoin plain and simple. And nobody tries to seize control over Bitcoin by expanding the Segwit proposal with a bigger block weight/size. BIP91 and 141 would most likely not have the support they have now if it wasn't for the Segwit2x compromise.

CPFP works flawlessly with Core. What are you talking about?
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:35:21
Yeah, it's probably a good idea to invest 120% of your capital into something you have no idea about. /s

There's Fidor already.

Will this also increase the SegWit block weight or is it going to stay at 4M?
@_date: 2017-07-15 09:01:22
Oh man, you must be new to Bitcoin.

Paycoin is still around? Wow, authorities are slow.

What I meant was that you don't necessarily need internet as a Bitcoin user. Best example is m-pesa (or however it is written) which uses SMS. You only need _some_ kind of connection.

Can someone elaborate on what to think about Pravda?

I'd say asymmetrical encryption including cryptographic signing.
@_date: 2015-10-07 14:45:17
Apparently. Get an IMSI catcher and you're good to go.
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:25:23
Thank you very much.

Are you using Bitcoin Core? Check whether your HD (hierarchical deterministic wallet) icon is greyed out. If it's not greyed out it has overwritten your wallet file with a new HD one. In this case create/edit your bitcoin.conf file to include "usehd=0" or use the starting parameter -usehd=0. Then replace the newly created HD wallet with your old wallet file and start Bitcoin Core.
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:49:04
That would be a terrible idea. [Link](

How can anybody take this for an actual possibility?

Why would anybody mine at this pool? You're doing exactly the same as every other miner except you're not getting a reward for your hash power.
@_date: 2015-02-22 20:22:31

That site is excellent! Love the about:config part.
Would be great to also see VPS providers that respect your privacy on that site.

I've just experienced this last week coming from XT. Yes, I'm talking about the windows zip file. My wallet.dat was overwritten with a new HD wallet.dat. Luckily I had a backup, so I set usehd=0 or whatever in the config file and replaced the new wallet.dat with my backup and now it's using the correct one.
@_date: 2019-05-15 20:32:18
Well, you see their banking information on your bank account, but this could be anybody's, now that I think of it.

Major interest in decentralization.

Core actually might overwrite your wallet file this way if you don't disable HD use before.
