Here is a plan for them, drop all the toys bitcore, copay, insight, all that crap and go out and get merchants accepting bitcoin, that's a fulltime gig and served them right back then.

They don't even know what bitcoin is, bunch of rich white kids that use to work at banks.

I'm sick of that

On Bitstamp and Coinbase I can just send bitcoin to a address and it converts to my account, no invoice bullshit.

I don't think he works there for a long time now, I think does

Their business model and bad management don't speak for bitcoin.

Exactly a company that never did much bitcoin volume but used as marketing.

That's a bullshit number, transaction volume is only increasing. The thing is, retailers are keeping the coins not exchanging them.

Insight is great, but unmonetizeble and everything else is a waist of time. As a business you need to focus, and they should re-focus on merchant adoption that is the core of their business model. I miss the days of them competing with coinbase on twitter for visible merchants.

That's what it looks like from the outside, wont be hard for you to find a job.
Why did Tony leave the CEO post?
@_date: 2015-09-03 03:03:08
That seems to be what these start-up people do, blame the world when their companies don't work out.

Are you management or a programmer? How many people work there now? What was the most people you had?

Lame, give me a better answer than that. I honestly want to understand, talk about great things you are doing, prove me wrong.
