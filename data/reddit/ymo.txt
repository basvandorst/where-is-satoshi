I've said this so many times every time I've seen someone refer to blockchain as the true innovation.  We've done this collective ledger since the 90s on volunteer bases, in many implementations.  Bitcoin changed decentralized computing forever.  Bitcoin was the innovation.

You're getting downvoted like crazy but you're on the right track.  Crypto and URNs (magnet) have been used and advanced in p2p applications for a very long time.  The blockchain is just a database that records our transactions and the so-called groundbreaking blockchain people always refer to is actually the p2p methodologies we've been using all along.

Coinbase treated me like garbage since the very beginning when they were running support on reddit.  They burned me SO MANY times on attempted purchases during runups.  If bitcoin ever fails at least I'll have the consolation of knowing that Coinbase went down with it.  
Coinbase is just as terribly managed as Mt Gox but at least Mt Gox has the advantage of being historically relevant, while Coinbase is just a slimy latecomer vendor making Bitcoin look conventional and frustrating.

There are a dozen reasons bitcoin is a risk as a store of wealth.  The reasons he presented are none of them and showed he's speaking with no understanding.  I don't even need to refute what he wrote because it looks like it was spoken by this anti-bitcoin guy on my FB feed who may as well be a second grader. 
I thought Buffet was intellectually admirable but unless this stance is calculated defense of his other holdings, he is, as they say in Omaha, an ig-no-ra-moose.

The job posting makes reddit's plan painfully obvious.  They're planning a redditcentric coin for tipping.  Essentially a remake of dogecoin.
The c++ and python is used for integrating with the comment system.  For those who think this is a difficult and varied skillset, look into praw.
A coin created and backed by reddit itself will be very profitable and I'm certain a mining operation is being built into the business model of the site itself.

People who rave about the blockchain but denounce bitcoin are revealing themselves to be internet novices.  Distributed computing and blockchain style innovations such as distributed hash tables have been around "forever" (in internet relativity).  
The blockchain is not the innovation.  The encryption is not the innovation.  Bringing these things together to create an alternative to central banking is bitcoin; and that is the innovation.

It's funny you used the term different because a psychologist would probably assign a cluster A personality disorder to this patient.  Cluster a is the "odd" cluster.  Namely, if this document is real, we're seeing a classic schizoid personality.
SPD is characterized by social apathy, emotional detachment, physical aloofness.  The logging and the net worth calculator are perhaps the patient's attempt to fight the indifference (as seen in the casual throwing around of large sums of money) and make this all more real.
There was an old video of Ross talking about an economics simulation he was working on.  If this is the same person, the language and tone used then is in alignment with the detachment we see in these logs.
PS. SPD symptoms are very common and I don't agree it should exist as a disorder prognosis.

Coinbase has always treated us like cofounders without reward (actually, our reward has been persistent mistreatment and a business model that grew to undermine bitcoin's core values).  It says a lot that the company cares this much about a single subreddit that the CEO is compelled to address us directly rather than marketing through other channels or actually contracting innovation.  They're well past the need for hackathons.
We built Coinbase to 400 million+ valuation and they still can't leave our nest.  They don't want to evangelize for btc, they want to continue to leech from the internal community of existing stakeholders.

You're not understanding what I'm saying.

It's circular logic and bullying that prevents the likely tens of thousands more from speaking out.
