Enough with the "Kim is going to defraud you" crap.  Give the guy another chance.  I mean he did make Megaupload which we've ALL used from one point or another.  Don't demonize the man for trying to attempt and possibly fix a problem with Bitcoin.........a big problem.........which is mass appeal.  Let the man do his thing and stop being babies.

Yeah another crazy thing I noticed researching this was that this "Satoshicard" has been programmed for other games.  The game Sarutobi has a secret "Satoshi" level where if you own the card you can access the level.   They also have a bitcoin geocaching game called "Takara" and they dropped a Satoshicard in the middle of the Atlantic.  The implications of this card permeating into alot of future crypto games is astonishing really..........and the fact it's called the "Satoshicard."  Probably could end up being the most expensive game item in history.
@_date: 2016-08-09 21:24:27
But how can they deem which is currency and which is not?  I think this is the reason Alt-coins are good for existing because some of them aren't actually labeled as "currency."  For example(and please refrain from the Bitcoin maximalism here I'm trying to issue a point) companies like Factom, Storj and some others have "tokens" but they're not actually labeled as currency themselves.  Bitcoin has been given this label specifically because well.....that's what it's intention was.  Now the legalities of this is interesting because then we start going into gray water with what we can actually label which blockchain is a currency and which one isn't.  How does one do that?  How does one even label Bitcoin as a currency when it can morph and do many things.  This must be fought for reasons such as this.  Methinks.

Well that depends really.  Counterparty already has use cases going on in the world with the videogaming industry(look at other reply below) and probably more to come too.

If you can't just try to gather as much of a well informed decision as you can.  In bitcoin world there are plenty of places to throw bitcoin in.  Some trade between usd and bit.....some with altcoins to bit.....some with other weird means.  All is a gamble.  Know your shit kid.  Know everything there is to know about the technology and upcoming disruptive technologies that will come after.  Study the economics of bitcoins leverage against all the rest of the old world currencies.  Study the struggles that the developers have amongst themselves and the danger this might cause in the future.  Study the Chinese current economy.  Study the movements and fluctuations of bitcoins sea economy (altcoins that trade back into bitcoin and vice versa), study the impact that has on bitcoins entire economical movements, study how the media portrays your investments, study how fast people lose their money and most of all..........KNOW BEFORE OTHERS DO.  The smarter you are at placing your chips in a great idea with a great group of people with a great drive and a great business model.....you might see your investment grow from an anthill into mountain.

@_date: 2016-06-08 21:56:32
Well technically you are wrong, 2000 something Bitcoins were burned to XCP to preserve it's value(and it's deflationary).  So technically they are Bitcoin but can raise in value determining in it's scarcity.  XCP wasn't created out of thin air, BTC was burned to create a certain amount of XCP and that's all there ever was.  Those coins were created to facilitate the tokenization within XCP's exchange.  If you take a look there's plenty of video game companies already utilizing Counterparty and are doing ground breaking things with game asset ownership.

If anyone is speaking about Pre mining in relation to XCP, the XCP coin total was created by a burning of some odd 2000 BTC.  So technically those coins werent created out of thin air......BTC was destroyed to preserve the value of XCP and also XCP is deflationary the more transactions take place within it's exchange.

Ughh, to think Bitcoin will reach that anytime soon is ludicrous.  You guys all thought it would be 30 grand in 2015...didn't happen.  If you at least pay some attention to the altcoin space you should already know that people who have large stakes in bitcoin sell off to other altcoins to profit more bitcoin.  Outsider money comes in.....original bitcoin traders sell into altcoin economy and vice versa.  Due to this the altcoin economy has been growing ever since.  It will take along time for outsider money to push that price up.  Just my thoughts....but my thoughts are pretty much right and I can't listen to counterpoint because I am astroman.

Yeah it's an interesting thing happening in blockchain gaming right now.  Game designers are making assets within the counterparty exchange.  These games once you start you can input your wallet address that houses those assets and your special abilities pop up in the game.

On top of that, it's just good to see practical innovation rather than the meager blocksize/other competing blockchain fear and uncertainty.

Here is a quick timeline of events in the rare pepe trading world.
1. The "Rarepepe" Asset was made on Counterparty which was one of the first to garner value.  It was a Pepe version of Dorian Nakamoto and only 300 were issued.  I believe they go for around over 200 bucks now.  This is a picture  ........of course more asset cards were soon to follow.......
2. A "RarePepeTraderGroup"  room on Telegram was made and now we have 1040 members currently, if you go on there have fun typing in "/p" to see random cards displayed of all the 1000 in existence.  There are some Japanese artists and many others partaking.   Truly, a global open source digital blockchain trading card phenonemon.
3. Over 1000 Pepe Cards have been made by people all around the world and are registered here 
4.  Yes.......this all runs on top of Bitcoin.
5.  Any Person can make their own card, but to register with the Pepe Scientists all the info is on rarepepedirectory page.
6.  Koji Higashi, the main genius behind Indiesquare wallet and now Book of Orbs has included a section to hold all of your RarePepe cards in a nice and aesthetically pleasing collectible app.   Book of Orbs was a wallet intended to house different game assets.  Also included is Spells of Genesis, Force of Will, MemoryChain, Takara and of course RarePEPE.
7.  A Lordkek was made and accidentally made divisible by a jack ass named GrounBEEFtaxi, he says it was by "Divine Kek interference" that the asset be made divisible.  There are only 10 in the world, that is why the card is very sought after.  1 was lost forever because a friend of his forgot his 12 key passphrase forever.  The last card was sold to a man named HAL through Counterparty's decentralized exchange for 1600 XCP, that is now worth currently $13,436.302  at the time of this writing.
8.  There are currently two video game developers working on RarePepe asset inclusion into their games.  First is "Sarutobi Island" a sequel of the bitcoin game Sarutobi, where you swing an 8 bit monkey for actual bitcoin in game.  It will feature VR capabilities and if you own these cards they will be able to be used in game. Likewise, another game called RarePepeParty which is also in development will use all of these registered cards.  I don't have to tell you how game changing being able to use 1 asset in many different video games is.  Very future dank tech here.  Oh yes and I forgot...........Takara, which was also made by Mandelduck(Sarutobi creator) allows you to drop Pepes anywhere on the globe via geocaching.
Sarutobi Island trailer.....
RarePepeParty Game trailer
9.   was made to further expedite trading and have a nice and smooth way to enjoy doing this on a computer.  
10.  Pepecash asset was made and now has become a currency in it's own right garnering a marketcap of 4 million plus dollars and is now used as the de facto way of buying and selling RarePepe blockchain cards.  I believe it's on the second page on  ...............soon to be first.
11.  RarePEPE auctions are now held to further establish value of these cards.........it has gotten more detailed in now the artistic quality and rarity issuances of these cards come into play.  I forgot what room name was......I'll get back to ya...............ok found it. Telegram room  Called "Rare Pepe Auction House"
Uh.......can't remember the rest but yeah..........some serious blockchain tech is being applied to memes.  Enjoy.

Been sayin this shit forever and now r/bitcoiners get the picture.  
There's a thing out there called the Bitcoin economy.  All you have to do is add up Bitcoin's marketcap by all other altcoin marketcaps.  THAT is Bitcoin's true marketcap.  The higher this number goes the stronger bitcoin becomes.  If you were smart you'd know that whatever business altcoins can create that will intrigue more outside money to come in, the more valuable bitcoin becomes.  When altcoins fail, it cashes out into bitcoin.  So yes.....let's put all this altcoin hate into the fire and let them bring a ton of extra investments into the bitcoin economy.  I'm pretty damn sure you'll see bitcoin go insane the more these projects tank.
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:09:41
This is off topic but I have to say, whoever made the theme song for Sarutobi needs the first Bitcoin game awards trophy.  It's weird, I keep listening to it and I imagine an orchestra playing the melodies...........quite a fantastic NES-style composition.  I caught myself humming the melody out of game hahaha.
One question about the Sarutobi coin.........does it fluctuate in price in Counterparty's decentralized exchange?  I looked in my Indiesquare XCP wallet and saw that the price went up.  How does that relate to buying the in game items(not saying I'm not happy that my Sarutobi coin went up in price, just asking what will happen to price of power ups).   GREAT GAME!

XCP value was created by burning 2000 BTC in the beginning to preserve it's value.  XCP is the token used to create assets.  XCP is Counterparty a decentralized asset exchange layer that uses the bitcoin blockchain to confirm its transactions.  So basically when we all throw assets to each other we have to wait 10,20 and hour even to confirm just like Bitcoin does.  XCP serves the bitcoin community by being able to issue tokens for whatever use is desired.  In the future XCP could be used to issue shares, tickets, points.....whatever the mind can think of.  We have also talked with the guys at and have already issued 100k shares of NASDANQ and they might use that as "players club" access tokens for their website.  Plenty of uses............we even found a way for only certain asset owners to be able to access certain rooms on Telegram.  So for example if we made a LORDKEK room.........only the people who own LORDKEK asset could enter...........just ponder that for a second.  That one blows my mind.

Don't know what you're talking about.  All coins are up over 100 percent from last week.  Looking at Poloniex on a BTC rise doesn't give you accurate readings NOOB.  Sorry to burst your hopes but altcoins haven't died and they continue to grow and expand in marketcap.  Just deal with it.

Sort of conceptual level, I like how you just marginalized that from literally all types of money.  Which is inherently a collective conceptual consensus of value.

To be fair, Blockstream are comprised of some pretty smug morons and Bitcoin sub is an echo chamber.  However, we do have alot of people with wisdom in Bitcoin.  Not a big fan of Roger Ver either.........on the other end his emotions have clouded his judgement.  So on one side we have over practicality with no wisdom and the other side which is just emotional Satoshi devotion.  We gotta find a middle ground here.

Well here are the steps usually that we Pepe fanatics go through.
1.  Go onto counterparty and issue an asset.  For demonstration purposes we will do LORDKEK.  On counterparty you can make an asset and issue as much as you want of the token.  In this case a mr. GrounBEEFtaxi made only 10 of LORDKEK.  You have the option to make it divisible or undivisible.  The guys that register the pepes on  have a rule to make it "undivisible."  The only reason LORDKEK was allowed was because it was one of the first in the cards made.  After that it was deemed less annoying to have the cards divisible and we all agreed as a community.  You can easily get onto the Counterparty protocol through "indiesquare wallet" app and create a token.  YOu must have some XCP to start(0.5 XCP is the token creation fee)
2. After the asset is made you can lock the issuance forever.  That is also another pepe registration rule however..........for any other purposes you can issue more tokens if you keep it unlocked.  We just lock the asset to make them forever that number.  So in this case LORDKEK was locked forever only to 10 full ones.
3.  After your asset is made then you can make a jpeg or gif to attach to the asset.  We have  and the app Book of Orbs that contains these jpegs/gifs to add value to them.  Most people will argue and go "I can can get that gif anywhere on the internet" and to that we address that the value comes from projects built on top to allow the asset inside of those projects.  If you own a LORDKEK and you have 5 video games that allow the owner to use them............that adds value.
3.  It costs I think .5 XCP fee to create the asset and that XCP is burned forever to make the asset.  XCP is deflationary because of this.  Tons of other projects are using XCP to make tokens for whatever application they need it for.
4.  Once you register your Pepe it will appear on Book of Orbs app and also on  and  
The Rarepepe community is akin to the Bitcoin community insofar as determining it's value.  However, where we differ is the fact that some Pepe cards become more valuable depending on certain factors.............number of issuance, memetic value and if the artwork is DANK(Making gif cards is the new benchmark).  Those 3 factors are key in determining which are successful and which are not.  A card with 100,000 issuance might be well sought after if the artwork is great enough whereas a card with only 100 might be shrugged off because quite frankly...........it looks like shit.

Honestly, if this was a pay-per view event.....I'd never pay for it.  I'd also never gamble on it with an assured outcome.  Basically I'm here to tell you all that you need to grow balls and Bitcoin is losing it because you all are not supporting it's testoterone.  Do me a favor, get some balls.........stop crying..........program.........and become fucking men.

Actually no I don't.  I just made this post so you could waste your time in deliberating a conscious thought about somebody you don't even know.......or will ever know completely.  I congratulate you on receiving an award of "neckbeard of the year."  Thank you for your diligence in constructing a completely useless and maybe somewhate thoughtful response to a worded and possibly useless and biased account of an individual you know nothing about.  Oh yeah and I hope your fake or non existent girlfriend sees this.  CIAO!!!!!

Economically it preserves the value of said protocol.  If you look at XCP's price which is at .004 Btc it's been there for a long time.  It is also actively in development.  It's just economics my friend, alot of Bitcointards still don't understand the strong ghost of value locking.  In the beginning, XCP burned 2000 bitcoins and it has proven to keep it's value for 4 years straight.

I'm almost done with the whole "internet of money" bullshit.  It's such a trite and limiting scope to label Bitcoin.  I would rather just call it the "internet of digital property."  There have been way too many successful experiments off of the Bitcoin protocol that advances what this blockchain technology can do.
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:10:18
Did that.  Steps: circle wallet to anonymous wallet to gambling site.  Always have done it that way.  Now they're obviously tracking 1 more tier down and looking at where the bits are going.  Very dissapointing.

As long as I remembered money was the backbone of every developed society.  Actually in hindsight the concept of money has had a larger fanbase than most other utility factors ever since trade began.  Bitcoin was finally extended to smartphones.......yet......it still took 7 years to even get a 10+ billion marketcap.  I don't see your argument's validity here.
@_date: 2016-07-11 20:08:15
Money has been an established mental franchise since the beginning of trade.  Still, keep going with your argument here.
