9:20 it has bounced up ~2% in the last 15 minutes but I'll reserve judgment to see if it sticks

So is the below true
- GDAX does not charge for any transfers from Coinbase to it
- GDAX does not charge network fee for transfers from GDAX to, say, Bittrex
- It takes weeks to verify for GDAX which is required before you can transfer funds out

problem is im not verified with GDAX and that could take weeks to wait for. so currently im not allowed to withdraw/transfer anything actually

I love these idiots using reddit made terms as if they're traders
Dip, correction, drops..... "there's a difference between them!"
Don't sit there like some condescending asshole saying "you should've bought at the dip NOT the correction" and act like there is any real knowledge about where a price CURRENTLY sits 
These wannabe traders giving advice are sickening. Shut the fuck up

Commodity material is a tangible thing with tangible applications
Shares of a company are less tangible than commodity but still result a sliver of ownership of a company and are redeemable for *something* in the result of a bankruptcy
Bitcoin is...... nothing. It's a fugazie. It's poof. It's air. Its the dingleberry on my asshole. It's not redeemable for shit.
You feel me blood?
