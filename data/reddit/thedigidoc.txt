Paid for some VPS rental; VPS initialization took longer than the 1 confirmation needed.

Exactly what I was looking for!  :-P

"Banks are developing new global payment systems...
Bitcoin may also face competition from digital currencies issued by banks..."
Maybe for the first month, then people will quickly realize the banks are using a neutered version of the technology, and switch back to an open system like Bitcoin. 
IMO, article author needs to watch some more Andreas Antonopoulus videos...

Maybe it's gone extremely-dark-grey market because of the Bitcoin-related arrests there?  Even so, you'd think it would bump the price x10, not x100...

I would love to see this kind of action in Canada as well.  Everyone in the tax and accounting industries needs more precise rules.

I'm also in a country with limited on ramps (side note:  We should refer to these exchanges as "on ramps" instead of "exchanges"), so I'm also interested in the outcome and alternatives.  Unfortunately I live in a rural part of my country where the nearest localcoins trader is about a 4 hour drive away...

Yay for those who are trading or investing, boo for those who are trying to move their fiat to the glorious blockchain-backed land of happiness.

If I remember correctly there's an option in their Android app to sweep a paper wallet.  Open the app, go to "BTC Wallet", then the scan button (looks like a tiny QR code in the upper right corner).  Once you scan the QR code it should give you the option to sweep.

This might be what gives Bitcoin the boost into mainstream.

Being Canadian, I have to deal with Canadian financial institutions and Bitcoin-related companies that are willing to work with our system.  I have to watch this video every once in a while to remind me that not everyone who is a part of our "system" is a closed-minded, knuckle-dragging, luddite.

I'm thinking more along the lines of replacing the voting mechanism on existing TV shows (ie Dancing With the Stars).
@_date: 2016-09-14 17:54:59
Agreed; better security.  But still more expensive than a paper-wallet.  Maybe paper-wallet for smaller transactions, and cred-sticks for larger ones?

I've never called, so I have no idea what the experience is like.  But the idea that I'd have to make a telephone call is enough to put me off.  Why not have a simple app or website that allows to you "purchase" crypto-tokens? 
All that being said, I feel like the target audience for most of the existing shows on North America are the stereotypical little old blue-haired ladies that would still use a rotary phone given the choice.  So a crypto-token solution probably would have much traction.

Possible (somewhat) common use case:
Offline transaction (not off-chain, as when they break the seal and transfer, the loading and receiving public addresses will be linked on the blockchain) for an amount determined well in advance, where the Opendime will be passing through 3rd party possession (ie. postal service).
Kinda like the paper cheque of bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-09-11 12:13:02
LocalBitcoins, Bitsquare 
@_date: 2016-09-26 16:48:56
I wonder if something like this (using a cryptocurrency as a voting mechanism) would work in North America.  As far as I know shows like "Dancing With the Stars" still use a telephone / SMS system.

I love this idea, but people are lazy.  For anyone who isn't too lazy to use this, what's the advantage over a decent paper wallet with a tamper-evident sticker?
@_date: 2016-07-05 03:35:17
Same question here.  Where I live almost all retail locations are chains, so payment methods are out of their hands.  But for the 5% others that get to make that decision, I'm not even sure where to start...

We here in The People's Disunited Socialist Republic of Canadistan are basically screwed for the time being.  I'm considering making a large investment via Kraken and selling via localbitcoins to those who need it while we wait for someone to take Vogogo's place.

I sent an email to Tesla's NA sales desk:
I'm wondering if it would be possible to purchase a Model S (either up front or via Tesla financing) with Bitcoin.  If not, do you know if this is something Tesla has considered or is working on?  I should also mention that I'm in Canada, in case that makes a difference.
This was their response:
As of right now, Tesla does not accept Bitcoin as a valid form of payment.  We may possibly look into this in the future but we do not currently have anything in place as of now.
@_date: 2016-07-07 22:57:05
If I could order a Tesla using Bitcoin (without using a CC as a middle man), I'd be extremely tempted.  Maybe I'll send them an email and see what their response is...
@_date: 2016-07-07 18:15:56
Forgot to mention that I'm in Canada (AKA The People's Disunited Socialist Republic of Canadistan).  We tend to stay about 10 years behind the rest of the world tech wise.  I'm probably on a bunch of terrorist watch lists just for asking people about buying their vehicles with Bitcoin... :-P

The site has an English option, but the forms &amp;  menus are still in Russian.  Google Translate doesn't want to load the page.

I'd love to get a print copy of this edition.  Anyone in Russia want send one to Canada?

When I accept a payment via cheque, inter-bank transfer, or credit card, I know that the money will not be in my account in spendable form for at least several business days.  With this in mind, I'll usually wait for a few minutes to see if I can get 1 confirmation; if not I just call it good anyways.  Even in its current form, Bitcoin is a far superior value transfer system than fiat from a merchant's perspective.
