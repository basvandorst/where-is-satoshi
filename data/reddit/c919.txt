I would love for you to consider 
This is the multiple myeloma research foundation.  Multiple myeloma is a blood cancer in which malignant plasma cells accumulate in the bone marrow, crowding out the normal plasma cells that help fight infections. These cells then produce abnormal proteins which may cause tumors, damage the kidneys, and impair immune system function.
Multiple myeloma is the second most common blood cancer, and  is considered incurable, but thanks to recent advancements in cancer research it is treatable. Historically, there was little hope because treatment options were incredibly limited. The Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation (MMRF), revolutionized the way multiple myeloma is treated, substantially improving the life expectancy of multiple myeloma patients. The MMRF has helped introduce ten new drugs and through the power of new technology, genomics, and immunology, lives are now being saved.
The MMRF constructed a unique model to break down barriers to traditional cancer research. It is based on three interrelated pillars: The Data Bank, The Learning Network and The Clinic. It is fueled by information and data sharing, collaborative expertise, technology, speed and urgency. Applying this innovative model to precision medicine—getting patients the right treatment at the right time—puts the promise of a cure within reach. It is the most effective approach in cancer research today, and is being emulated for other disease research.
A couple of the drugs found by the MMRF extended my dad's life as well as thousands of others.  We lost him this year, but I am very thankful for the extra time we had with him and hope the MMRF can continue to give many more people the priceless gift of time.
Thank you for reading, and for deciding to do some good.

Except when it is the husband telling the wife to sell... just saying.
