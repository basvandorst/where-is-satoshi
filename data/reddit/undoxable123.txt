barriers to entry being so incredibly high that like 4 companies can reasonably compete

Surprised to come across someone with libertarian tendencies on a bitcoin subreddit? Kinda strange.
I mean.. think about how game-changingly billionaire-making uber and lyft have been. all they did was get under government taxi licenses.
It's not a far reach to say that government permitting/licensing interrupts free market innovation

you underestimate the value of internet and rudimentary laptops/phones in 3rd world countries. there's a lot of media around this type of stuff. shitty internet and some old phones can practically revolutionize the lives of people in places like poor african villages.

what if a part of those barriers to entry are rigorous approval processes by the US government before launches?

dude. the IRS doesn't give a shit about this weird "lost horizons" meme link. if you are realizing huge gains and not claiming them and paying capital gains taxes you're gonna get burned.

this is a garbage meme article.
Hey I just invented a currency called zanyCoin. I have the only one and its worth 1000000$.
wow can you believe how small a fraction of a zanyCoin is greater than a us dollar????
