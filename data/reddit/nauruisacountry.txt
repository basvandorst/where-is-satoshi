Statistically speaking: Only if you know more / are more intelligent than the average trader. Which is difficult in bitcoin because there is no real knowledge but just speculation involved for the short term at least. In that sense if you have your money in for 50% of the time on average, you will get 50% of the hodl-gains on average...
The only thing I do (as opposed to most people in this subreddit) is securing my possesion with a stop-sell order and a lower Limit-Buy when it hits extrem Alltime-Highs so that if you get the up and down afterwards (like after 10k), you can make some profit off of it. But again you may loose money with this, if the rate drops below your Stop-Sell but not below your Limit-Buy and then up again.
But in the days after 10k $ I outperformed the market by a factor of 2 for a couple days then I went back to HODL mode.

Did you ever balance your assets though? I was recommended to choose a percentage say having 40% of my fortune in BTC. Then when it doubles or triples and suddenly makes 70-90% of my fortune I should sell parts of it to lower it to maybe 50%

1.1M € right now. Wow
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:19:37
At this speed it's gonna be 20k by the end of the week. But I guess that would be too much.

But in EUR BTC is up 30% in the past 24hours. The market IS crazy right now...

Same for me. Just wanna stay anonymous. I assumed the same goes for you. It's just a time that a lot of people are joining the community and we look like newbies...

Also 18k in Korea, and 17.2k in EUR. The market is crazy right now.

While I am no expert on the matter, [This Wikipedia Page]( does not seem to agree with you. JP Morgan has 2560Bn (BTC would reach that at roughly 150k) and some chinese banks have up to 3890Bn (equals BTC at roughly 230k)
So I assume it would take bitcoin to go to 230k. More interesting (because more similar) is the comparison to gold though. All gold in the world (estimated 170,000 tonnes) amount for about 7000bn $. BTC would need to go almost to 500k to match that...

I am in Korea right now and have a EUR-account on GDax, so I could play the game and withdraw cash at Bitcoin-ATMs in Seoul. I just dont like the idea of putting that much money at stake and with atm fees and exchange rates i loose at least half of those 10% in fees...

The thing is, getting good at Day-Trading is not really a thing in bitcoin. Patterns don't repeat, it's pure luck. Hodl means you believe in a long term gain independently of short term fluctuations. Day Trading means you bet on completely unpredictable short term fluctuations.
There is one thing that worked out for me though (as someone who trades in EUR): I usually compare the EUR-price to the USD-Price. If the EUR price is more than 5% above the USD-Price it means it usually slowly adjusts towards the dollar price over time. Like right now, the EUR-Market is extremly hot - almost 10% above the dollar value. Those are the times that I do not invest or rather place a STOP-Sell order.

This. If you actually were a developper you wouldn't "write a exchange for fun" bec. you'd know that something like that takes a fuckton of work - 5% of which would be fun coding, 95% painfully implementing interfaces and making sure it is save

I can beat that. Anyone needs advice?!

I am currently in Korea (where Coinbase does not opperate). I can access it but as soon as they have some kind of load-problems (like in the past days) they seem to kick out all users with Korean IPs first (Was not able to access it for hours while it worked perfectly fine through VPN). I always have a VPN to my homecountry available though. Works nicely that way.

Or place a Stop-Sell order, nothing to loose...
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:37:19
Just google them. It's easy: It sells automatically (e.g. on Gdax) after the price dropped blow a certain mark.

Except that Bitcoin is not the biggest bank. Not by far. Every single one of the 60 biggest banks listed by Wikipedia has several times more assets, than Bitcoin has market cap
