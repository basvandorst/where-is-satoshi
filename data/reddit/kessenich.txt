How big is the possibility that the NWO institutions will create a crypto currency of its own and forbid use of all other crypto currencies ?

beware of dragon's tale as it was in alpha testing modus with tons of bugs and glitches - for 3 years (!!!)
now it is in beta (since few months) and will eventually stay in beta for another 10 years because the developer does not want to pay back bitcoins to people suffering from bugs or glitches or just human failure...he ignores them, the whole company ignores them
however, the game got played really a lot when bitcoins where worth like nothing, so the devs got a ton of coins, i would bet the developer called teppy (Di ingame) is one of the richest bitcoin holders, i am speaking of hundreds of thousands of bitcoins, if not millions
do not trust them with your bitcoins, you will eventually lose everything
also, there is no age verification or verification of identity at all, but still it is a casino where people lost their house and everything (not me)
one could think of little children plundering the bitcoins of their parents and playing there - watched by adults who do not care at all...
also they moved to costa rica with their servers now as they were not allowed to do credit card payments within USA, maybe the reason is the above mentioned too
i personally read in the game that the developers told us there were credit card frauds and now you can pay with a credit card for bitcoins in there but you are not allowed to withdraw them - security :)
the guy who owns the game does not care about it at all, he personally says it is a hobby of his
he has no intention to make the site more secure, to warn about online gambling dangers, to prevent children at any age gambling with high amounts of money, to prevent whole families going bankrupt because of online gambling addiction and so on - money laundering maybe too, who knows
funny thing is - if you ask them what this game is: It is an MMO - if you ask them why you lose so much money to play an MMO then they say "Hey dude, it is a casino"
tl;dr - dragon's tale makers have no morals at all - level system = ponzi

do not fall for people telling you to send them bitcoins and wait a while so that you get more bitcoins - just does not happen!!!!!
it's a trap
