OP didn't ask any question. That was a reply to the guy who thinks involvement of POTUS makes the Fed any less private.

Lots of countries are creating their own cryptocurrencies, like China and Russia.

HODLing does not mean you do not buy things with bitcoin. It means you do not sell it back for fiat. Two different things.

'Although an instrument of the U.S. Government, the Federal Reserve System considers itself "an independent central bank because its monetary policy decisions do not have to be approved by the President or anyone else in the executive or legislative branches of government, it does not receive funding appropriated by the Congress, and the terms of the members of the Board of Governors span multiple presidential and congressional terms".'
Took literally 2 seconds.

People who buy bitcoin to make a quick buck instead of the ideology and long-term mindset behind it haven't understood anything anyway.  Those kind of people will get burned in life lots of times, doesn't matter if through bitcoin or some other means.

The entire mainstream media thinks that, you're not a special snowflake. If you follow that train of thought and come to the Bitcoin subreddit because of it, don't presume to know anything the innovators don't. Don't construct your post as "I doubt Bitcoin's value, prove me wrong", but as "I believe in Bitcoin's value, prove me right". I'm sure people would be willing to discuss open-mindedly with you if your language didn't sound like you've already made up your mind.

Haven't done it on Coinbase because I'm not gonna use it anyway, and Gdax doesn't recognize my ID. Can you list those exchanges for me? Gonna try them later then.

Here's an idea: don't sell.

From what I can understand, you DO think "a decentralized, inclusive, instant means to store and transfer wealth without any 3rd party" is valuable, and that you question Bitcoin's technology in itself, not cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology as a whole. I think you simply express your opinion not well enough.

Yeah sorry lol, same shit as Coinbase, not gonna pay those fees.

It has a value of 1 BTC. If someone thinks 1 BTC is worth his car he might give you his car for it. Same as 1 USD has a value of 1 USD. It's not backed by anything except belief. The difference with BTC is there is no central guy behind it that can just go "okay 1 BTC is now worth only 0.5 BTC, get fucked".
As long as people continue to compare Bitcoin to fiat, the ideology behind Bitcoin as a replacement for fiat will never go through.

If you don't compare BTC to fiat, BTC always has the same value.

That's pretty much the biggest leap in interconnectivity since the invention of the Internet? I suppose that's not exciting enough huh.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:37:31
I did not. Glad I did at least now even though I probably wouldn't have bought there anyway.

What I'm wondering is this, when I came to this sub around 2 weeks ago and looked at posts of noobs asking for the best place to buy/get into BTC, the most prevalent answers I saw were still Coinbase -&gt; Gdax. I'm also most certainly not going to use Coinbase because of the reasons you stated, but why is it still being recommended if it's so hated in the core community?

GDAX shows BTC price around 200$ higher than Bitfinex, is there an "official" price on any exchange to watch? Obviously if I want to buy I'll compare exchanges, I'm talking about for example a tab I can keep open at work.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:49:09
I suppose this also applies to Gdax then, right? What about other big/often recommended ones, bitfinex for instance?
