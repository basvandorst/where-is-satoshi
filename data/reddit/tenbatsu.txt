Here's how I think it should have sounded:
Our financial system is in dire need of an upgrade.  
Many of the bank and credit card fees you pay are pointless relics of 20th century systems.  
What if there were a way to put complete control of your money in your own hands?  
Enter bitcoin.  
There is no bank.  
There are no borders.  
Spend your money how you wish.  
Send your money where you want.  
Get a digital wallet and see how bitcoin can help you today.
Edit: Added "dire"

Looks like I'm in the minority here, but I thought this was terrible.  Lots of stock footage without much substance.  What is the point they're trying to get across?  Who is their audience?  Take a look at the script without the video patchwork, and consider how someone outside the community might view it.  
  


  
Uhhh...  
  


  
Sorry, I'm still stuck on DNA...  
  


  
Sure is!  
  


  
Mankind also invented hyperbole.  
  


  
I'm listening...  
  


  
I'm thinking...  
  


  
Can't argue that.  
  


  
And...  
  


  
This directly affects some of us, yes, but...  
  


  
Lousy capitalists!  
  


  
I love bitcoin!  
  


  
It's a what now?  
  


  
Do my taxes pay for this?  
  


  
I don't follow.  
  


  
Oh... hey, this is interesting.  Tell me more about   
  


No go back!  Tell me more about how I can send money cheaply!  
  


  
Damn it.  
  


  
"Start" a wallet?  You lost me, poindexter.  
  


  
Uh huh.

I guess I'd only be a little mad, so long as it helps the community ;)
@_date: 2018-02-26 11:17:06
Just out of curiosity, what do you base that on?
@_date: 2011-05-20 07:56:04
Anybody know where I could find these parts in Japan (store, website, anything)?  You'd think it'd be easy to find out here.  Unfortunately, you'd be wrong.
@_date: 2011-06-17 05:21:05
Correct.  You need a program that repeatedly overwrites the spaces where the data used to exist with junk data.
Edit: afaik, shift-delete simply skips the recycle bin.
@_date: 2011-06-25 01:16:40
Have one more :)
@_date: 2011-05-21 01:46:13
Sorry, I should've provided more detail.  Kakaku lists cheap prices, no doubt, but I've had a lot of problems with their etailers not accepting foreign credit cards.
Sofmap is out.  Rakuten is out.  Amazon is definitely out.

Good Answer in a [previous thread](
@_date: 2011-06-18 11:56:49
Well, if you are indeed blowing the whistle, as dominatrixyummy said you'll need to come up with some evidence.
@_date: 2011-06-02 09:20:31
See [previous]( [threads](
@_date: 2011-06-18 09:28:06
Yeah, I'm inclined to agree.  In any event, it seems to be working again.  Crisis averted! hurrahhhh

I think you accidentally a math.

@_date: 2011-05-27 07:56:59
Sorry -- I'm new to the party and haven't been here before.  That notation seems well and good but I'm thinking about Joe Average here.  In the US it's not dollars and centidollars (well it is, but it's abbreviated) -- fractions of bitcoins need real-world useable names.
@_date: 2011-05-27 07:58:21
Agreed.  So uh... where can I find said community?
@_date: 2011-06-01 03:16:46
Practically useless without the ability to specify country, no?  
@_date: 2011-06-14 02:45:24
There's a difference between "MtGox got hacked" and "someone found my credentials and used my account."  I understand that you're in an awful situation, but please substantiate your claims.
@_date: 2011-06-03 10:04:33


Sounds about right:

I find these bitcoin graphs to be pretty useful: 
@_date: 2011-05-19 12:07:47
Did you check out the rigs here?
@_date: 2011-05-19 12:25:11
Why two 6970s rather than one 6990?
@_date: 2011-06-19 00:59:18
**Solution**  
  
It turns out that now useragent is required.  Adding the following did the trick:
curl_setopt ($c, CURLOPT_USERAGENT, "blah blah blah");  
Thanks for everyone's input.
@_date: 2011-06-14 02:49:41
Ah crap, sorry about that.  $760 in a month.  Well, $785 based on the current (and exceedingly volatile) exchange rate of 19.42 USD/BTC.
@_date: 2011-06-17 02:59:08
Instead of moving it, I'd recommend copying it back to the flash drive and then shredding the file on the hard disk (File Shredder should do the trick).  You don't want to leave any traces of your wallet on your hard drive.
@_date: 2011-06-14 02:28:27
Based on  you can expect to pull in about 7-800 Mhash/s.  Throw that at the profit calculator ( and, ignoring hardware and electricity costs, you can expect to pull in about $760.84 (based on a Mhash/s of 750) at the current difficulty rate (567358.22) and exchange rate (18.8 USD/BTC).  However, difficulty is heading for a major increase so your profits will depend largely on how the market moves.
If it were me?  Yes, in a heartbeat.
@_date: 2011-05-27 07:57:30
Already?!  I'm bitter.
@_date: 2011-09-02 02:48:54
only as wrong as the future dictates.
@_date: 2011-06-15 08:38:00




Can't see that happening.
@_date: 2011-06-13 01:04:45
You should be good to go.

* Create a truecrypt volume
* Mount truecrypt volume
* When running bitcoin, point to truecrypt volume (e.g., "C:\Program Files (x86)\Bitcoin\bitcoin.exe" -datadir=d:\Bitcoin)
* Close bitcoin
* Unmount truecrypt volume

Since you live there, you're privy to the unfathomable paper-pushing that most of the world doesn't get to see, so I totally understand your sentiment.  On the other hand, with companies like Panasonic, Hitachi, Mitsubishi, Toyota, and Sony, it's hard to claim that they're not.
@_date: 2011-06-06 01:35:48


It will pick it up the next time you turn it on.

I would advise against this.  Even if you encrypted the file yourself, there's still a non-zero risk keeping it online.  If you want to keep a few bitcoins online for ease of transactions that *might* make sense, but you should keep most of your stash in an offline paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-14 11:02:25
OP, please do what Ingo_sweden says.
