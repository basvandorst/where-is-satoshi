SegWit + 2 MB HF should shorten it to less than 3 months I guess.
Sounds pretty feasible to me as I don't think those 100 millions users will start using Bitcoin tomorrow.
But we definitely need to learn a bit more about BitCache first.
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:57:03
Some are definitely working on a HF :
And 2 MB was the value some core devs agreed on during HK meeting.
I'm pretty confident that some reasonable block size increasing HF will occur in the coming months.  Time will tell.

From Bitcoin wiki: "New transaction types can often be added as softforks, requiring only that the participants (sender and receiver) and miners understand the new transaction type. This is done by having the new transaction appear to older clients as a "pay-to-anybody" transaction (of a special form), and getting the miners to agree to reject blocks including these transaction unless the transaction validates under the new rules. This is how P2SH was added to Bitcoin."

Was just wondering.  Suppose you have something like 75% of the mining power hosted/managed in one specific country.  You have no fee market as blocks are now huge or of unlimited size.  What forbids you to meet your fellow miners around to define a minimum transaction fee together?  Is it something totally unrealistic?  Cartels seem to be pretty common in real world economy.

Looks like there is some kind of caching/reuse involved : "The hashPrevouts, hashSequence, and hashOutputs calculated in an earlier verification may be reused in other inputs of the same transaction, so that the time complexity of the whole hashing process reduces from O(n2) to O(n)."
@_date: 2016-03-13 23:25:25

Looks like the "feefilter" p2p message BIP might solve the problem and avoid any increase in bandwith usage even with a limited mempool:
"A reject filter was also introduced to help prevent repeated requests for the same transaction that might have been recently rejected for insufficient fee."
"The reject filter is reset after every block which means transactions that are inv'ed over a longer time period will be rerequested and there is no method to prevent requesting the transaction the first time."
"After receiving a feefilter message, a node can know before sending an inv that a given transaction's fee rate is below the minimum currently required by a given peer, and therefore the node can skip relaying an inv for that transaction to that peer."
Looks like there is also a rolling bloom filter that tracks the last 120000 failed AcceptToMemoryPool calls, I guess it's what was talking about.
 - Keep track of recently rejected transactions with a rolling bloom filter (cont'd)

And then come Schnorr signatures permitted by SegWit script versioning...
Related link for those interested: 
Excerpt: "With Schnorr, however, all inputs will instead require only one combined signature to represent all these different signatures. This offers an obvious data advantage, as only one signature must be included in a transaction, only one must be transmitted over the network, and only one must be included in a block. This means there's more room for transactions."
This will allow to drastically reduce the UTXO set at no extra cost, would lower it in fact.

**Myth  Blockstream has patents in SegWit.**
*No, we don’t. We don’t know of any patents anywhere that apply to SegWit. We have not applied for patents on SegWit, nor are we going to. If anyone (including us) was considering it, it would already be too late because the public disclosure of SegWit was more than a year ago. Although we have an open patent strategy to protect the ecosystem from patent trolls and we encourage others to adopt this approach too, our patent strategy doesn’t apply here because this myth is simply not true.*
*We see SegWit as an open source technology contribution to the ecosystem. SegWit is a proposed improvement to the Bitcoin protocol that includes a variety of features to enhance security and performance. It was a public proposal discussed in December 2015, and its creation was a collaboration across the Bitcoin community, including multiple individual participants and companies, including Blockstream.*

My 0.13.1 node has been up for a week and I have already served more than 77 GB of data.

Things went at least twice as fast after that.  Still took me almost two days to have my node fully synced though.

Yep it would definitely interesting to have a fees/size over time chart.

What a bunch of trolls.
@_date: 2017-04-11 09:09:03
What if SW supporting miners shared a common mempool you could send your tx to?  Wouldn't it reduce the orphaning risk a bit?  If those miners are really supporting SW, they might be willing to take that risk.
I think that's an idea worth thinking about.
@_date: 2016-02-15 16:44:36
Thanx for answering.  So that means that their registration covers any type of crypto currency and is not Bitcoin specific?
@_date: 2017-04-07 05:58:30
The number of pools doesn't mean anything.  As it could be verified recently.

Probably relates to this: 
*"We offer a backwards compatible modification to Bitcoin that ensures that pools smaller than 1/4 of the total mining power cannot profitably engage selfish mining. We also show that at least 2/3 of the network needs to be honest to thwart selfish mining; a simple majority is not enough."*

I have seen nothing new since then.  Not sure the selfish-mining problem has been really ridiculed either.

What about Bitcoin Cash? I guess it could become the "real" Bitcoin at some point then.
Or what about Bitcoin Gold?  Would that mean that hard forks changing the PoW are impossible/forbidden (Satoshi's vision) in some way?

A PoW algo change might be the only solution to keep the coin alive in the case of a long lasting 51% attack against it.  Unless I missed something.

They are all defined in the code.  Would be a bit too long to list them all here.  Nobody has ever done that yet in fact.

What are you talking about?  Can you explain to me how the Core dev team has hijacked Bitcoin?  Did I miss a contentious HF they forced on the community recently?
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:49:44
I think you just missed the whole SegWit2X problem here.  It's definitely not related to a simple block size increase.
I'll make it simple: if there is no consensus, don't change it.
Or eventually make your own "clean" hard fork if you really want to.

I'm definitely not interested at all in your Bitcoin.
That will just mean that Bitcoin was a beautiful utopia.
Hopefully you are wrong.  Time will tell.
@_date: 2017-10-24 09:16:07
Opposition to some HF doesn't require justification.  As long as a significant part of the community is opposed to it, as long as there is no consensus, as it seems to be the case at the moment, don't change it.
SegWit2X should have been a clean HF instead of trying to hijack the original Bitcoin.  That will probably kill it.

@_date: 2017-10-28 13:40:59
I think you are comparing apple and oranges here.
A change of PoW algo HF should only be done if it's absolulety required to keep the coin alive.  That's definitely not the case for B2X.

@_date: 2017-10-25 12:46:41


Sounds like a few other consensus rules are missing there.
Should rather be written:


@_date: 2015-09-06 20:05:38
Your source is a bit outdated, check latest version of BIP100 here:
As of today: 
- The raise value is defined as a vote for 2400th highest block (20th percentile).
- The lower value is defined as a vote for 9600th highest block (80th percentile).
- If the raise value is higher than current hardLimit, the new limit becomes the raise value.
- If the lower value is lower than current hardLimit, the new limit becomes the lower value.
"there can be a 21% minority dragging the block size limit down" isn't possible anymore.  They can still keep it at the same level forever though.  That is the price of consensus I guess.
@_date: 2017-10-28 11:21:35
Do you think we will really need constant proof-of-work changes?  One should be enough to cool things down for a few years I think.
@_date: 2015-09-28 07:31:37
@_date: 2015-09-06 21:38:49
If more than 20% disagree nothing will change.  Check post below for more details.
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:56:25
You are just describing a 51% attack here.
@_date: 2015-09-27 07:50:55
It's rather long term versus short term vision.
@_date: 2017-10-08 07:48:25
Check this: 
_"Now, we are launching a new pair of CSTs for another proposed consensus change: Segwit2x_
_Bitfinex is introducing new CSTs that will allow traders to speculate on the potential activation and mining of the Segwit2x consensus protocol. We are designating these CSTs as BT1 (Incumbent Bitcoin Blockchain) and BT2 (Bitcoin Segwit2x)._
_These CSTs will trade against BTC and USD pairs, initially, without financing capabilities. We will reevaluate that decision at a later date if and as there is sufficient liquidity."_

What about the solution implemented in Sidechain Elements:
"As transaction IDs no longer cover the signatures, they remove all forms of transaction malleability, in a much more fundamental way than BIP62 aims to do. This results in a larger class of multi-clause contract constructs that become safe to use."
Could it be backported to Bitcoin?
