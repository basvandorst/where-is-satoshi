To act as a store of value, a money must be able to be reliably saved, stored, and retrieved – **and be predictably usable as a medium of exchange when it is retrieved. The value of the money must also remain stable over time. Some have argued that inflation, by reducing the value of money, diminishes the ability of the money to function as a store of value**
so bitcoin is like blackhole eh//// once you put value in it,you can not retrieve it becuase you  cannot reliably use as a medium of exchange. i try to send 20$ and i have to pay 1.40$ for Tx fee?????? camon dont you bullshit on me.
