Uhh, what? Last I checked, the price of Bitcoin has been relatively stable for almost six months now, with only $20-30 price swings up and down. 
If we are going to talk seriously about volatility here, this has been one of the calmest periods for Bitcoin ever. 
Until we see another $200 spike in price like we did in November, I'm going to say this is all just wishful thinking. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 21:03:00
I guess it all depends on if you see all altcoins as shitcoins and gambling. I stopped being a Bitcoin maximalist long ago, and completely divested out in June of last year. It's not like I just throw darts at a board to pick my holdings, I do tons of research. White papers, subreddits, slack channels, Bitcointalk threads. It's up to you to find those projects with merit and serious long term potential. Since I divested out, I've seen gains of 2100%, 1800%, 2300%, 2000%, and 800%. I have no losses. Taking a risk pays off, if you do your research. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:22:36
Can you give me a reason why you would not use Litecoin over Bitcoin at this point? Drastically lower fees, far quicker transaction times, tends to be less volatile than BTC, and the market cap is far lower, giving you room for much greater and easier percent gains. 
Disclaimer: I don't even own any Litecoin at this point, nor Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:09:56
In that case I'll give you a very clear example that has been tried and tested: Litecoin. At this point in time, there is absolutely no reason to use Bitcoin over Litecoin. Litecoin can do absolutely everything Bitcoin can do, except faster, and cheaper. Things have gotten so bad for Bitcoin that it is cheaper to sell your Bitcoin for Litecoin, incur market fees, do a speedy on chain LTC transaction and incur cheap LTC transaction fees, and THEN buy back into BTC on the next exchange, rather than doing an absurdly slow and ridiculously expensive on chain transaction using BTC. That's how bad things have gotten. At this point, there is zero reason to use BTC over LTC. It's so bad that I actively advise crypto newcomers to avoid Bitcoin pretty much all together. 
All the BTC fanatics ever have to respond with is that the lightning network is coming, and that it will turn everything around! But guess what, it's not here, and likely won't be anytime soon. Bitcoin can't even do smart contracts to give it some added utility. "But but but, Rootstock!", sorry, that's not here yet either. This has always been the common theme and the talking point with BTC. Bitcoin can just implement the upgrades that newer blockchains implement, but it never ends up happening. Back in the day the hype was colored coins, today its lightning and rootstock. Same shit, different year. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 20:40:10
I agree with you, and yet even after acknowledging that, Litecoin can do every one of Bitcoin's use cases better at the present moment, all while likely providing you a far greater ROI. Even after you take into account the eventual shared scaling issues, you could replace Litecoin with about any other non-shitcoin with merit, and the point would still stand. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 19:54:27
So you would agree then, that at least at this point in time, there is no rational reason to use Bitcoin over Litecoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:13:02
What's funny is that these two communities are so caught up in the hate for each other, that they both fail to see that BTC and BCH are ass at this point compared to newer cryptos. PoW is the way of the past, BTC is grandpa that already had his glory days, and BCH is his retarded brother. And I say this as someone that got into crypto back in early 2013. Not only is the tech nearly obsolete at this point, but it's a shitty investment in terms of maximizing gains. 
I'm sure I'll be downvoted, but the truth hurts. People attribute so much irrational sentimental value to BTC, but it's nothing but another blockchain that happened to be first and set the stage for the others.

That's the point. It limits the power of the state. By limiting the power of the purse, governments can no longer wage endless wars unpopular wars. 


You ignore the whole reason that the U.S. was even able to go off the gold standard and the USD became the world reserve currency. Guess what the result of WWII was? America won and became the top superpower on Earth. The U.S. was extremely stable and able to exert its influence the world over while Europe and Asia were crippled. Investors could be certain that their dollars were still going to be worth something in 10-50 years, and American dominance put confidence in investors. Of course Germany wouldn't have been able to go off the gold standard... They were strong, but making tons of enemies and engaging in total war isn't exactly good for your economy. The U.S. on the other hand, was essentially completely isolated, leaving their industry and war machine to continue unaffected, despite the war in Europe. 
When you abandon fiat, you are saying "We don't want to use YOUR money, we're using OUR money.". Government can longer just print more money to cover their expenses, they would be financially accountable to the people.

Economics is not a hard science. There is not one singular consensus of what is right and what is wrong. In the past few decades this sentiment has grown and it just so happens to be the mainstream line of thought at the time. That doesn't mean it isn't up for interpretation. 


No, you seem to be missing the point. An infinite amount of dollars can be printed into existence. This cannot be said for gold, and this cannot be said for bitcoin. Originally, currency was backed by gold or silver, hence how if you wanted to, you could go to a bank and collect the value in gold of your dollars. This kept fiat currency in check, because you could not issue more currency than the value of your precious metal reserves. This is no longer the case. Fiat today, is backed by no more than confidence in the state, and the illusion of value.


Now this is just getting semantical. I wasn't defining bitcoin as money, I was highlighting how I never said bitcoin was currency.  Yes, money can be used as currency, fiat is however is no longer "money". When it was backed by a commodity, sure, then it was fiat money, because it was a note or a receipt ultimately representing a claim on gold/silver (money). This is however, no longer the case. Fiat is no longer restrained by anything, such as gold reserves, hence why it can be printed into infinity.

Money does not mean currency. Both currency and money are:
1. A medium of exchange
2. Portable
3. Durable
4. Divisible
5. Fungible
However money is a store of value, currency is not. Currency is not a store of value primarily because more and more of it can simply be printed into existence. Gold is money because there is for the most part, a finite amount that is in existence, or at least available to us. Summarily, Bitcoin is a store of value because there will only ever be 21 million in existence. Yes, bitcoin is subjected to periods of volatility, but given the assumption that volatility will level with adoption, then it will meet all the criteria of money. 
Fiat is based on no more than confidence. Bitcoin is backed by cryptographic algorithms (Proof of work) and the value of the blockchain technology in general. 
@_date: 2015-03-13 22:26:59




This is all very true, and very possible, but Bitcoin has one thing going for it that a private blockchain would be unable to have, and that is the decentralized nature and lack of central authority.
If one entity or a cartel controls the entire process of mining and has all servers under their control, then there is nothing stopping them from hard-forking the blockchain whenever they want, and bending the currency to their will. 
Say their private currency was initially set to have a hard limit of 21 million coins. They are adamant about this and promise they will never go back on it.  Well, 5 years down the road, they decide that they would actually like another million coins. They just devalued all the other coins in existence. Now this makes them very similar to a central bank.
With Bitcoin and its decentralized nature, this situation is damn near impossible. I think the decentralized nature is reassuring to investors, and helps build confidence that their wealth cannot be arbitrarily devalued by some central entity looking to benefit itself. This is why I think bitcoin is the preferable option here compared to a private blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-05-31 00:14:10
Yeah it seems the Coinbase wallet is broken for doing transactions that are on chain/without Coinbase payment processing. It seems you need to essentially "overpay" by plugging in the amount you intend on sending, then copy the total amount including transaction fee and use it as the base payment you will be sending, which THEN will have the transaction fee applied. 
What a shit show. Essentially Coinbase is subtracting the transaction fee from the amount you are sending instead of adding it on, which results in you underpaying for any on chain transactions unless you do what I stated above.

It's highly doubtful they were involved in the hack itself. Far more likely is that the hackers directly contacted the BTC-e operators and they helped directly facilitate the money laundering. 
Also, I doubt much of anything is going to come of this. It's looking like after the other BTC-e operators discovered Vinnik was arrested, they halted trading and then started laundering the BTC-e stash through Monero. They will probably be back in business in a few days, albeit with one less founder, and far more cautious about which countries they travel to.

Have separate wallets for a "checking" and "savings" account. One account is exclusively for investment purposes and is essentially savings that you never touch. Decide on an amount to purchase at set intervals such as every week. Any BTC you buy over that set amount you deposit to the other wallet, also known as your "checking". That is your spending BTC. 
Spending your BTC ensures that the BTC you have in your savings will actually appreciate and be valued higher. By spending BTC you grow the bitcoin market and you are part of the driving force that actually makes your Bitcoin worth anything. That is why you want to spend your Bitcoin.

The reason for the incompatibility with those who do not follow the party line is because those who believe have already had their own personal paradigm shift. Those who don't believe won't believe until it smacks them right in the fucking face. You are either ahead of the curve or behind it. 
I think a better point to examine is why do the believers believe? They believe because given all the facts about Bitcoin, the technical, monetary, and social innovations, it is damn hard not to believe in Bitcoin. Bitcoin or another cryptocurrency WILL succede, it's practically inevitable. Bitcoin will almost certainly revolutionize the remittances market and that market alone is worth in the four hundred billion range at the minimum. If you include Hawala in the remittance market then that market estimate goes up to almost nine hundred billion dollars. Why will Bitcoin revolutionize remittances? Because of almost zero fees, near instant transactions, and the removal of most of the middlemen. The remittance market alone is enough to send Bitcoin to the moon and you have to be pretty fucking ignorant not to see that. 
I don't think Paul Krugman is an idiot, I just hate him for being a Keynesian tool. Paul Krugman and frankly any other skeptics and nonbelievers are in my opinion just incapable of believing in Bitcoin because of how rooted they are in the current ways. The paradigm shift likely won't reach them until it smacks them in the fucking face. Bitcoin is simply too unorthodox, too revolutionary, too earth shattering for them to actually see it for what it is. They are behind the curve and that's that.
So in summary and going back to where I began, the reason Bitcoin believers are so adamant about it and so hostile to the skeptics and naysayers is because it is painfully obvious to them that Bitcoin is here to stay. They see exactly what it has to offer and exactly why it is better than the current systems we have now. To the believers this shouldn't even be a discussion anymore, that's how painfully obvious it is. The believers have experienced their paradigm shift and the nonbelievers won't have their's until Bitcoin is firmly in the mainstream and is breathing down their neck. 
This is the internet boom 2.0. Those of us who see it for what it is will come out of it with the spoils saying I told you so and everyone else will be left scratching their heads wishing they hadn't been so stupid and listened. Bitcoin is the next logical step technologically, economically, and sociologically and the only thing that can stop it is an even better coin.

Exactly. I completely agree with you that just throwing them a bone is essentially a temporary solution to a permanent problem. 
I think the bottom line is that many of these people who are homeless often do have underlying issues that are certainly not helping them get out of poverty. They clearly need some form of rehabilitation to help them reintegrate into society as productive, self-sufficient individuals. Clearly the ways we have currently been dealing with homelessness have not been working, or else it simply wouldn't be an issue anymore.
Clubhouse model is designed to help these people reintegrate into society. It is a series of stepping stones designed to ultimately help these individuals reach a point where they no longer need someone to hold their hand. At the core of a clubhouse there is a community of individuals who have your back for every step you take. This social support and the sense of belonging it provides is immeasurable in how it holds the whole clubhouse system together. You are not a patient, you are a member, and often that sense of empowerment that the clubhouse provides is enough of a push to get people going down the right path.

I think the only way it is going to appreciate like Bitcoin is if the adoption rate goes up. Let's be real here, who the hell accepts Litecoin at this point? Yeah there are a few but even in comparison to Bitcoins adoption rate which itself is still relatively small, Litecoin has like no adoption. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:15:07
Exactly. I think increased speculation by the Chinese will put LTC on the radar of a lot more people and this will in turn get more companies adopting it.

No need for hostility, but I'm wondering what is stopping Moore's law from breaking the system? If computer processing power were to increase exponentially, would that make any difference at all?

There's no reason you couldn't work out that exchange with someone on localbitcoins, it's just a matter of finding someone who wants amazon giftcards.

Yeah I actually just got my first Litecoins yesterday. The way I did it was by creating an account on BTC-E, sending over some BTC from my Coinbase account, and then directly buying LTC with some of the BTC I sent over. Then if you want to sell LTC to get back to USD you can sell your LTC back to BTC and then send the BTC to Coinbase or wherever you have your bank account linked to and sell for USD.

From what I know they are pretty much identical except that Litecoin has faster confirmations and doesn't take as long to mine. I like to look at it as Bitcoin being gold and Litecoin being silver. Watch for litecoin prices to go up quite a bit in the coming months. China just last night showed that there is significant interest Litecoin by rocketing the price all the way up to 20+ a coin. China is the trendsetter here and I would follow them, but that's just my 2 cents.

I am personally in favor of a clubhouse model for dealing with issues of homelessness which often are exacerbated by substance abuse issues.
Successful and well known clubhouses do exist, such as the Fountain house in New York City. Currently the goal of such clubhouses is to assist individuals with severe and persistent mental illnesses. I believe that expanding the definition to include individuals with severe substance abuse issues and by proxy homelessness, would help these people drastically more so than just generous donations. 
The best part? It can all be handled by NGOs so no need for big brother government to attempt to get involved and then just screw things up even more. 
Clubhouse model is designed to empower individuals who have persistent mental health issues effecting the quality of their lives. I believe that empowerment is tremendous in actually helping people become better more capable individuals.
Just my two cents. I am a fan of the clubhouse model and I believe it has significant application here.
