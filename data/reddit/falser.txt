You are underestimating the power and willingness of the US government to maintain its control over the population and extract wealth from its citizens.  A large part of how they do this is through the US dollar and the Federal Reserve.  Bitcoin massively disrupts that power in a way like nothing before.
Just look at what they were willing to do Iraq and Afghanistan just for theater, revenge, and the desire to capitalize on Iraq's oilfields.  Neither country was even vaguely a threat to America's dominance.  They killed all those people and tipped over those governments just to fuck shit up like an angry teenager.
Just wait and see what happens when a stance on bitcoin emerges.  If bitcoin really starts to undermine the US dollar, there absolutely will be clampdown.  And all the laws introduced since 9/11 give them a lot of powers once a certain group of people are labelled "terrorists".

I find it impossible to believe that Satoshi is a real person, and developed Bitcoin by himself.  It's too good, too perfect a plan, and executed so spectacularly to have been accomplished by one man.

But what, at this point, would compel a large bitcoin holder, to suddenly sell that many at a time?

When radio became oversaturated with commercials, people went to CDs, mp3's and Sirius satellite, and I think eventually they'll stop using fiat also.

I find it very weird to see bitcoin performance in percentage points like that.  I simply have never thought about like how you would say a particular stock "went up 11% today".  I've always focused on how many dollars it's up, or just whether it's making new highs.

The ability to bill on a per page basis, is an internet infrastructure problem that has NEVER been solved.  Lots of companies tried and failed to implement a system that worked, but anything based on US dollars was doomed to failure because of credit card fees, bank fees, never-ending fees imposed by corrupt banking institutions.
Bitcoin still has fees, but perhaps a system can be built on top of it to solve the microtransaction problem.

There is only $1.22 trillion US dollars in circulation.  Therefore if bitcoin reaches total parity, a bitcoin will be worth roughly $111,000.  So basically, at best there is a 100 fold increase coming.  After that the US dollar will then be priced in Bitcoin, not the other way around.

The price is the least interesting thing about bitcoin.
My first "eureka" moment occurred the first time I transferred a fraction of a bitcoin (via bitcointip) to my personal wallet.  The transaction happened so fast, it was like magic.  It worked as smoothly as a visa card, but without dealing with a bank, and in a currency not controlled by a central government.  That is what is amazing about bitcoin.
