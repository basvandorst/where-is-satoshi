i like to think it'll replace the entire worlds wealth by 2025 and each coin would be worth around 25 million ... but that'll never happen. 
yeah, much more likely to be in your range

second section "dialing without dollars" please!
@_date: 2019-07-12 00:34:26
more like... 19M
.. so thats \~370k per bitcoin if it takes over for gold. 
.. yes. thats a Lambo.  terrible investment if you aren't holding much coin, but you can get a lambo for around 200K before taxes.

when google has been proven to alter your feeds in order to induce depression... then they are that evil. google hasnt been proved to do that.. facebook has.

Until they have a mind reading device and can search for words in your brain while you are actively avoiding thinking about it... no they can’t get it.
until quantum computing comes about of course... but then just an update to the code fixes that.

what places accept stock or gold as payment? you can trade it as any currency... eventually if/when it is adopted globally, its value will be determined by itself.. much like the dollar. if you want to buy and sell the dollar, how do you trade it? what currency do you use?

i feel like we are just in the denial/fear stage of the current correction.
@_date: 2019-11-29 13:53:16
tell your mom to mail me a check and ill buy bitcoin for you

dude, what part of my post made you think anything other than i believe its all speculation? miss the quotation marks? the "if they even really do exist" part?
if it wasnt speculation, we'd all be billionaires.
@_date: 2019-11-29 11:15:45
The "cycles" if they do really exist seem to take longer and longer to produce. this one is too quick compared to the last one. If you compress the current cycle, you could actually see a similarity of where we are now to the post-anxiety / pre-denial stage

i dont believe you, you definitely cant deposit gold at any bank. maybe in a safety deposit box. 
banks would need a scale accurate to the thousandth of a gram to consider this transaction. Those are scientific grade scales and while not too expensive for a bank, they definitely do not have them on hand at more than a few scattered locations across the country.

yeah, but that is no different than bitcoin. 
good luck buying coffee, or games, or anything on overstock with a truck load of paper.. even appropriately price physical gold would confuse the hell out of them. 
 the finite nature of BTC compared to "USD_DIGITAL" is a HUGE difference. does every USD_DIGITAL dollar have a reference/serial number trackable? The physical dollar does but not the Digital versions. 
You are thinking purely transactionally. And I agree on a transaction only basis - without thinking of security or inflation or manipulation... then yes, they would be similar once everything gets to that point.....
.. but thats missing the entire point.

that part? that part is the premise of the entire post above that i responded to. its literally all you talk about in that post. 
if you want to go back to "the dollar is dead" idea that I originally responded to? Ok. you're right, its not dead. yet, or maybe never. Currently, we value Bitcoin in dollars.. sure.. of course! But that's always temporary. Once hyperinflation comes there will be different store of value and different currency. Just like it's always been.

China is allowing people to mine and use coins again. They might actually be buying and mining as a government in order to hedge bets in the trade war. 
I’m sure they have a plan here. Probably to find ways to ruin the US economy.. then eventually try and control bitcoin with their massive internet surveillance. They are cocky but too much so.

loll.... are you insane?
@_date: 2019-08-12 08:22:47
whats your price?
@_date: 2019-08-01 06:24:38
they literally just started releasing apps in the past year. theres sites online where you only buy with BTC.. adoption will grow. It will be a currency.
@_date: 2019-10-10 17:33:51
what does 100 even mean here?  so the only thing nigeria searched for for like 1 year was bitcoin? it makes no sense.
@_date: 2019-10-15 14:21:36
didnt they already figure outa huge % of the stored gold is actually fake?
@_date: 2019-08-28 02:08:31
i still feel like these charts are way too aggressive. i see 20K by end of next year and i'm good with that. Hoping it dips back to 8 k again soon!
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:09:04
You'd think after 2 years that they would've added a few more servers...
@_date: 2019-06-27 05:34:04
it... exactly the same. just change the label and move the decimal over like 9 places.
@_date: 2019-12-03 08:35:04
I love the idea but.....
Theres a pretty solid chance that you are already in the .2% of the world population in total wealth.  6 billion people in Asia, Africa, South/Central America.
.2% of just those is 120million people... and it's pretty reasonable to say the average American's/European's net worth beats most of that (from 240k to \~100k with all assets and savings/retirement included)  
edit: oops. 12 million... 1 btc looks a lot better,
@_date: 2019-12-03 11:47:49
oops. fixed
@_date: 2019-09-06 05:30:22
eh... is it though?
@_date: 2019-09-06 02:59:09
even better plan!
@_date: 2019-09-18 02:31:07
if its even real gold... theyve been finding a shit ton of fake gold in reserves lately. 
and 386 billion is a lot.. but its a drop in the ocean compared to how much USD is held
@_date: 2019-09-05 11:41:50
No leave it there for the next dip
