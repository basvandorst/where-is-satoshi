I feel for those people who have their accounts locked up right now. Hope it all shakes out well for everybody.... Fuck tether
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:18:51
Thank you, I believe it helps to revisit it though because there are enough questions that keep resurfacing as to the business practices of Bitfinex and the relationship with tether that seem to still be unanswered I.e. why they are still not backed by a bank and why they haven’t had an actual audit completed.

Lmao cheers ol chap ��

This comment just put me much more at ease. Still nervous BUT this makes a lot of sense.

I just want to say I’m proud of BTC for holding tough through such a long and sustained asswhipping. I told myself months ago to never bet against bitcoin again because it proved me wrong too many times before. Let this same lesson be passed on for the newbies here after seeing what’s taken place. Going to rebound in a big big way. Good times fellas, good damn times!

I’ve been so caught up with all these damn subreddits on eth, BTC, and the crypto market in general I’m not up to date on his YouTube channel. Great man though, extremely happy he got this BTC donated to him, he deserves it.

I like this.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:02:20
But it’s a global market. How about all the countries that will buy any low bitcoin price because they believe the price will continue to rise? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:56:34
About time! I’ve been waiting for this man’s take on the CME!!!! Awesome! Thank you for this.

Futures trading will be HUGE! Futures are already risky but in crypto it seems insane lol best of luck to those that take that plunge. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:46:20
So much more money about to pour in. Great! Once one giant firm commits the others will be quick to follow. No one wants to be left out of making money
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:43:41
Like....right now right now. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:57:52
Future is now 
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:01:15
At that time Amazon will be taking BTC payments for prime hahah future is bright. I’ve been extremely impressed with the community through the last few months.

"We hope that by year-end, [we] will be able to come out with some guidelines on cryptocurrency, particularly those related to anti-money laundering and terrorist financing"
This makes me fearful that this will be the route governments take in order to make mining, exchanges, and crypto illegal in there countries in order to be appease the big banks.

8k bitcoin like - 
@_date: 2017-09-28 16:54:05
Original chain will live on. Price will fall to 3k. B2X will split off and have a price around Bitcoin cash. Core developers will continue to improve the original bitcoin code and make it more efficient. Eventually will soft-fork and double the block size when the community comes to that consensus and isn't being given a hostile ultimatum.  
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:33:51
Read it all, it's really well written and enlightening. This is one of those issues that it pays to be informed about. It isn't overly complicated and it's an easy read. Long live decentralization!

“Never short bitcoin” tell that to all the people who made millions shorting all the way from 20k down to 6k. 
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:34:24
I think saying never is absurd! I was one of those people who stood idly by as it crashed from 20 to 6k and have since read up on TA and have taken a proactive approach to increase my stack which I have done through shorting multiple times.
