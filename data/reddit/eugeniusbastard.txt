When nominal interest rates are lower than the rate of inflation, it is said that the real interest rate is negative.  Think about it this way: if I put money in a savings account that earns 1% interest (sadly this is above average today) but the rate of inflation is 2%, that account is losing 1% of its value every year due to inflation (earning 1% nominal interest and losing 2% via inflation).
Right now the ECB is offering deposits at a negative *nominal* rate in an attempt to counter falling inflation.  The idea is to penalize holding money in the wild hopes that you'll spend it before it can be devalued any further.
This is exactly why I hold bitcoins.

I don't think you understand that a satoshi can be made to be individually and uniquely identifiable.  One satoshi that's identified as being worth one barrel of oil using its blockchain history and some additional programming isn't going to be worth the same as any other satoshi in the pool.  The only point of failure exists in the person backing up that satoshi with a promise of a unit of oil; he needs to be able to prove that he can honor that transaction however many addresses far that satoshi travels down the blockchain.


A "generic" coin is worth whatever its value is determined to be worth in the overall market, and any other identifiable coin would have its own value and worth in a side market.  Owning a "generic" bitcoin that isn't tied to any particular asset has its own uses and serves as a different vehicle of value and worth than, say, a unique bitcoin that derives its value from being paired with an equity in addition to being a bitcoin.

I think I'll stick with coinbase for the foreseeable future.

Those are the (grouped) total bid/ask orders in the books at higher/lower prices than the current market price.  They are off to the side because those orders are not going to be filled until the current orders (to the left) clear the house and move the price point, it's for information purposes only.

coinbase(.com) != Coinbase :: blockchain(.info) != Blockchain
Gets confusing sometimes, thanks for clarifying.

That makes total sense, you explained it well.  Removing the 100 block rule was necessary to manipulate the txs into larger blocks without changing the coinbase rule set aside from 'coinbase_maturity'.  I actually never knew about that specific rule.

Can anyone explain what's fundamentally different about coinbase transactions that it would require its own rules set?

I agree that it's a big risk, one I probably won't take.  The only scenario I could see myself exporting a private key would be for an off-chain transaction.  If you do this you should most definitely use a throwaway hardened parent key and never use that account level again unless you're positive its extended public key will never be leaked (never say never).
@_date: 2015-01-07 10:24:03
You can export individual privkeys, but if you have an exposed xpubkey (i.e. watch-only wallet) you only need one child privkey to reconstruct the entire extended key chain.

Most likely right, and it was just a sidenote remark.  I was asking a broader question about BIP32 HD wallets in general since I'm researching its known real-world vulnerabilities before using it to store my funds.

The flag originates all the way back from the mid 1800's during the Edo period and is an important cultural symbol of Japan, closer to the iron cross than the swastika (the iron cross is still widely used by Germany today and was similarly introduced roughly a century before WWII).  The current Japanese naval ensign is the sun disk with rays but slightly off-center, I don't think Germany would get away with using an off-center swastika.

I think what is trying to say is that using a Bitcoin IOU system doesn't solve any of the problems of the modern financial system Bitcoins are meant to fix.  The biggest problem we face today isn't the verification or velocity of a transaction, but rather the need for a trusted third-party (banks) to hold and issue value.  With Bitcoin IOUs, banks can still devalue your savings and control where you spend your money.  The true value of the peer-to-peer banking system is that now banks can do neither.

Wallet32, I love the bare UI and pure functionality.  Unfortunately Wallet32 is a one-man development team so if you find a glitch (like I did) or are looking for any support you're pretty much out of luck.  It's a real shame too since I think it's one of the best wallets out there.  I would move to something like Mycelium but their front-end is horrendous.

That's incorrect, I just checked and there's still a total balance value limit of $50k on GDAX.
