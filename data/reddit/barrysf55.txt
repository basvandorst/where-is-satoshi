It's (apparently) a "legacy" address, meaning that it's identical in format to what a bitcoin address would be.  So by some lovely turn of fate, bitcoin may be "sent" to such an address - meaning value can be taken in exchange for it...  but not received - meaning value can be (again) taken from it.  Neither time is that value given to the individual who actually bought it.  Nice little scam for those without a conscience.

I'd gladly take it versus nothing, though, believe me.

I can't back up the specifics you give (simply because IDK), but it sounds like good advice.  No question that dot com should be avoided, though.  My experience tells me that loud and clear.

It's fraudulent to some degree, at least (imo), due to the wording used - which serves no purpose but to make a false connection.
Why else would they do it in such a questionable way?

He's a real charmer, I'm sure.  I noticed a picture said to be of him, flipping-off those who've been scammed.

One concern I have is that Simplex has attached their once-good name (tmk) to this, and they oughtn't do that.  Upon trying to sort it out, the Simplex rep couldn't offer anything but to say, basically, "remember, we're just the processor!!  we can't help it if someone gets stiffed with something other than bitcoin!!"
The immediate defense he presented indicates he's seen it a million times already.  Maybe that should tell Simplex something about their "business partner".

Do you mean the "private key"?  If so: What does it mean, ultimately, as to what'll happen to the funds?
Does bitcoinwallet dot com (the mysterious-looking gents running it) simply help themselves to it?

You got that right.

Unfortunately I don't know how to get the bch to begin with, though.

bitcoinwallet dot com

I don't appreciate the way he does business.

For myself, it'd be (admittedly) rather small.  It was only a little more than a hundred bucks.
But I need that 100 much more than the players do, I'm sure.

Just checked it and found 614 confirmations.  If you'd like to know the addy, Deminero, just hit me with a few thoughts in a PM to let me know what's up.
I'm now forced to wonder what'll happen to that value, and who will make the ill-gotten score.  I suppose it's next to impossible for me to expect to recover it, myself, seeing how it'd require the good nature of bitcoinwallet dot com to reveal the private key.  But, just like Simplex, they've probably seen it a million times by now.  They'd much prefer to hum loudly to themselves, twiddling their thumbs, attempting to look as saintlike and blameless as they can manage.
And, to be fair, they're nowhere in the depths of Bitcoincom/Simplex and couldn't possibly be so offensive.

You say, responding to an account equally new as mine.

Problem is that my wallet doesn't recognize the alt currency they sent, so I never actually got it.
