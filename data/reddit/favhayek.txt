Tomorrow means today for them. It is Japanesse time.
[---&gt;More Information here&lt;---](
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:20:28
Are you an insider?
@_date: 2014-02-16 22:49:26
At least. 
Did you read it?
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:27:34
We will see little kid.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:50:51
Mr. Karpeles, you have to read it.  A good technical support will help too. ;).
@_date: 2014-02-19 01:38:05
I have found this too "However, he said the company had discussed its business model with Japanese authorities "to ensure that we are operating within the law here." " 
[Source Wall Street Journal](
So the next question is: what do japanesse laws say about it?

Their silence, it is a good point. They could demonstrate their solvency to us or to a third party of mutual confidence. Has anyone formally asked for it?
At the other side Roger Ver has backed them. He and other people are changing bitcoins for GOXcoins for a better price than MtGOX. 
I think that withdrawals with limitations are more a question of time than a question of posibility. Besides, the last announcement was very specific about what activities are they doing. I think they were good news. 
Finally, the only thing that I really know is that we have to wait until thursday or before, if they are not as incompetent as we think they are.
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:40:40
Probably MtGOX will announce the withdrawal of bitcoins will be done in a period of time and the amount of withdrawal will be limited. In that case the price of bitcoin will increase slowly. And of course, not mention the exact time of retirement will help, just as Bitstamp did. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:26:37
Mr. Ideas. What happened with Bitstamp is a fact. You can google it. What could happen with MtGOX is not a fact, of course. But there is high probability that they use the same method because Bitstamp has demonstrated that it works. Otherwise, the will have to face a big withdrawal of bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:16:23
It is the fastest response, but why?
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:05:32
I think they will limit the withdrawal amount too. I think they have the resources, otherwise Kerpeles will have to face many cheated bitcoiners and some lawsuits. For sure.
Anyway they offered an announcement for Feb 17 Japanesse Time.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:57:21
Jaja. Don´t worry your insider knowledge will come back. And if we are lucky guys, it could happen before this thursday. ;)

We have helped them and we have supported them for enough. Of course they have forced us. But if they did not make money with all of this circus. I will be very dissapointed. So, again I think solvency is not a problem for GOX at this point.
@_date: 2014-02-17 00:23:53
You attack the messenger but not the message. It appears to me that you are the fool. Did you read it?. I mean all of it. For your information, fiat currency is backed by the law and if you are afraid from been cheated for your bitcoins you can sell your GOXcoins in other places. So the next time, you have to be smart. Try to read before you try to think or to write. I will apreciate that.
@_date: 2014-02-18 22:42:56
I mean, we know that there is an incompetent management. But the problems that they will have if they don´t solve the withdrawal issues will not be easy to afford. Legally speaking. 
I don´t know when or how much it will be. They say that they could make a new announcement before thursday, and of course they will have to do something to avoid a big withdrawal. 
I am pretty sure that they will return us our money. I want to know when it could be, and the bitcoin community could help.
At this point I don't have expectatives. It is only a question. Don't take it personally.
@_date: 2014-02-19 02:41:33
I share your thoughts about their incompetence. But Karpeless seems too confident as to be insolvent. Managing an insolvent bussines, and cheating people around the world?
I would not want to be in their shoes. I prefer to think that he is not as ~~idiot~~ incompetent to do that.

What do you think about?
@_date: 2014-02-16 23:08:55
For sure. :)
But in that way, they are putting their asses on fire. So they need to do something else.
@_date: 2014-02-17 14:33:59
Yes, but the time between MtGOX succesfull announcement and the bitcoiner announcement will be important in order to create trust. I know they have to do something else in order to create confidence. But I think this is the best way. If they announce it directly, they will have a lot of troubles in a very short period of time.
