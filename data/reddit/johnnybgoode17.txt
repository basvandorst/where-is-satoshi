I tried it a couple months ago. Tastes great, banana, strawberry, chocolate, whatever. Almost too good, like they might be pumping way more sugar than I'm looking for. Price is great as well. The bill I got from UPS for a $10 import charge (US) was pretty disappointing though. I am not going to start using checks for this.

You didn't post a reference either. To continue in that vein, I would argue that a very large majority of people did *not* hold that sentiment towards MtGox. Even disregarding the amount of trust you can put into cryptography vs a human being, everyone who bothered to do a simple Google search on MtGox knew that it was a terrible place to do business with. 
You don't go out to eat at a restaurant that your friends got food poisoning at, do you? Check into a dealer's reputation before doing business with them, *especially* in online transactions. Hence, Ebay/Amazon's "A++ will do business with again" etc.

Yeah, these guys have been better than MtGox ever was. Twitter account actually informing users what's happening, etc. Relatively much more transparent, even though you don't know who they are.

I wish I could see it that way. It is an effort to co-opt, and Bitcoin is not invulnerable. It could be used the way we know and love it, or they could throw [greenlists]( etc and severely neuter it for the gain of the political elite.
@_date: 2014-02-10 02:58:10
Yeah, people have been freaking out about it recently but it's been very isolated, and looks like just user error security-wise. Coinbase could probably do a better job pointing out how to be safer, but really it's on the user.

I'd much rather have plenty of private regulators than expect an easily-manipulated monopoly (your "relevant government authorities") to do the job properly. 


Regulating reputation, especially in the digital realm, is incredibly important! Surely I must be talking to a troll. Which sellers do you buy from on Ebay/Amazon/Silk Road? The ones with no reputation? Or the ones that are highly regarded in the community?

I ordered something from them, it's been delayed twice so far. 
An email mentioned something about a State regulation requiring my acceptance of the delay within 24 hours, or they would be forced to cancel the order. I wonder how they expect me to get my Bitcoin back for that one.
@_date: 2014-07-26 12:27:59
What he means is: the state will recognize they aren't getting paid in this way from Coinbase, so they'll enact new measures that work against Coinbase to hinder its services until another company that will give the state "their" money comes along and takes the place of Coinbase.

I agree. Seems to me there were multiple 'forced' jumps since $240. Somebody taking the opportunity Greece is providing. There was a more natural rise at first, but didn't go far. Then these unnatural jumps to $300. 
Then again, it's hard to say what is "natural" in Bitcoin. $20 jumps here and there aren't objectively "unnatural" for Bitcoin, but it doesn't feel right.

I am downloading Eufloria right now... It would be less expensive in bandwidth costs if you also put them up on a torrent like Humble Bundle (also, it would be much, MUCH faster..).

I don't see it being the only (or even the major) currency of the world in the long run, but I can see these fiat currencies dying because of it. Bitcoin being the major currency would make a centralized point, not in the network but in currency in general. Easily manipulated, etc. But a bunch of cryptocurrencies competing against each other?

"Let me give you this sheet of paper, then install this program and scan the sheet of paper to the-oops, let's try again, scan the sheet of paper into the computer..."
Just the fact that you're scanning something physical into what is supposed to be a futuristic currency seems so backwards, and definitely males it more daunting for an introduction

@_date: 2013-05-09 21:02:50
I bought about 2 Bitcoin after hearing about the whole Cyprus thing, and I had heard that a lot of Iranians went to it when the U.S. imposed their recent sanctions that sent their currency into hyperinflation. I first bought through BitInstant by Dwolla but had a lot of troubles there, I think Dwolla's API had some issues or something, my order fell apart *after* I sent the money but *before* they sent me the Bitcoin. Dwolla was a nightmare anyway. The rest I bought through Bitfloor. I just sent cash through Bank of America and it was in my Bitfloor account. It was super simple, I didn't even have to give my name to the bank or anything like that. Fortunately I put all of that money into Bitcoin a few days before it was shut down, or I would be dealing with that whole fiasco. My main issue with that is that I couldn't send it through my bank that fast, and I had to be there in person and fill out a form and blah blah normal stuff that seems archaic to me because I'm young and have grown up on the internet.

That's good to hear, because I haven't seen any BTC from you for **nine days** (Order ID 814a33cf-cd1f-407b-b3b4-23f0eecd065c).  
My first order from you, I [lost $5]( because **you failed to honor the price at time of deposit** (Order ID 69fdb78a-fd84-4bfa-b21e-c84d58e58b33). Hopefully you really will honor the price this time, because I have **[lost over $35]( so far on this order that has taken nine days.  
I expect there to be some confusion considering the very limited BitInstant order log (which is hopefully the reason why it has been ignored for so long). I think the Dwolla API broke along the way or something, but *I have the Dwolla logs to confirm that the money was sent to BitInstant*, so I would appreciate some sort of response at my email address or pm here as quickly as possible.

["'Well, if you don't stand up, I'm going to have to call the police and have you arrested.' I said, 'You may do that.'"](
You can keep calling people insane but you're not really helping your case, if you actually have one. 
Good luck though, I'm sure you're helping in some way or another.

His reply to the copyright comment implied that he *couldn't* watch the video, not that he couldn't bother to.

I would like to see voodoo calculation of USD/BTC with that market cap.

wtf is deepbay

What's special about that card?
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:26:49
I'm looking at BitInstant and BitFloor, but BitInstant screwed me over (currently waiting 10days+ on an order).
So... I think I'll go with Bitfloor.
@_date: 2013-11-12 04:52:24
Really? Would you mind linking to where they say that?
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:48:14
Exchanges have built in wallets for you. You have to trust them though. BitFloor is super fast, but you need a Bank of America open (it's a little late where I am). BitInstant can be used but I've found them to be untrustworthy (been waiting over a week on an order). Good luck.

Edit that comment, give the source for the address.

Oh nice, freddiew
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:06:35
So there are just a bunch that you don't bother listening to?
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:54:52
Good summation 
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:04:34
Yeah no thanks on that 5% bit

From what I understand, the profitability (if there is any with this option) will drop as the difficulty increases as more ASICs come online.

And château de crypto or something. Should be in the sidebar I think.

I've always been disappointed with the modern PIN entering techniques. How is it done with Trezor?
@_date: 2013-11-08 05:56:30
Then let it forever be known that sometimes I pay incredible amounts for seemingly meaningless things!

I agree with the sentiment but I don't know if McAfee is the best guy to point to for that. Didn't he almost certainly kill his neighbor or something?
@_date: 2013-06-29 22:38:57
I don't know but I love the idea. I would love to do that
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:07:17
lol his poor decisions and he's blaming the protocol
@_date: 2013-04-08 21:57:39
I've been waiting 8 days. I opened two support tickets at bitinstant.ladesk.com (suggested by their Facebook page), and both of them were closed without any sort of response from them.

The freedom is still there, it's just not as valuable. There's a difference, no one's stopping you.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:29:55
I don't have a problem with it either but it would probably be more efficient to set up with that bitcointip thing
@_date: 2013-11-13 17:56:49
Look into Dark Wallet on indiegogo!
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:49:21
This is what I've been thinking but no one else has been saying.

Panic moved my coin to my main wallet from the headline. It seems a lot of people are having problems with Coinbase. We really need a Yelp for bitcoin
