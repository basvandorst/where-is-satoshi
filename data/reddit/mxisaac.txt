I think the author's point is that the solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem through a blockchain requires incentive. If someone invents a solution to the BGP, it's going to be something entirely new.
You're talking about other ways to solve the BGP.  He's talking about understanding the blockchain.

Hey man, that's not exactly a fair statement.  There can be anywhere from 2-300 people involved in a movie.  I understand wanting a new system that circumvents gatekeepers so that they don't take unfair cuts.  Or studio execs dipping in strictly because of a guaranteed producer credit.  A system where filmmakers distribute their work on a platform where the money flows directly to them is the ideal system.  But a film (or tv show) is like a ship's crew. There are a lot of people contributing.  Louis CK's deal is a really, really unique thing that doesn't / can't apply to all films and TV.
Also, those people you don't like and don't want to pay are often times funding the film in a way that the filmmaker can't.  They risked their money to see a project completed and deserve a return on their investment.  Even the lowest budget film is going to spending, lowest, 300k.  Anyone who says "I did this for 10k" isn't being entirely honest.  It's hip to brag about how small a budget is in the indie world.  People on a shoestring budget are calling in favors, lots of them.  They're getting free equipment, locations, etc.  And they're only getting free labor/equipment because people subsidize what they do by working on well-paying gigs.  That dirt cheap film actually had a production cost closer to 300k-500k.  Unless you want every movie to look like The Blair Witch Project. 
For me, an example of a great system would be where the file itself acts as distribution.  You download a torrent or an MKV or some file format.  When you play it, the file pulls pre-determined micropayments in Bitcoin, so you pay as you watch.  You can bail if you're not digging it and have only paid for what you watched.  The money is passed through an autonomous payment system that distributes the funds in percentages to the cast and crew based on legal terms agreed upon prior to the films release/encryption.  10% to Bob, 5% to Nancy, .5% to Steve.  Essentially tying up the contract, payment, and distribution into one neat little system.  
I have no idea how this could work in real life, and I have a million ideas as to how that system can undermined. But if something like that could exist, it'd be unbelievably popular in the film and TV world.

I've noticed that when I explain Bitcoin as a store of value, that it could someday allow people who can't get bank accounts to safely store their money, or allow nations in political turmoil to have safer control of their money, people gloss over.
If I tell them it's a solution to a problem that has plagued computer science since it's inception, and that it's a new technology that can open up advancements in multiple fields, not just a universal value transfer protocol, they sound interested (as shocking as that sounds).  
I believe it's because the earlier statements sound grandiose and politically charged.  As if it's fixing a broken system, and the people involved are part of extreme change.  The latter sounds like innovation, advancement.
When you preach to people, when you tell them what to do and think, the basic human response is to shut down.  Human beings hate being told what to do.  This has been proven in study after study.  We resists commands.  
Dragging along politics creates resistence to an amazing technological breakthrough that naturally has no agenda attached to it, except in the minds of some gravitating towards it.  The majority of people here, I presume, believe in the advancement and adoption of Bitcoin, but we come across as like Scientologist giving stress tests, and that's neither accurate or helpful.

It's just the news writing public narrative.  The narrative is, unfortunately, that Bitcoin is buckling under it's own weight and will collapse.  I think it's less about people not getting in early, and more about the public watching "those Bitcoiners" who "made money they didn't deserve" fail. We all love a good story, and this has all the makings of a compelling one.  Strange currency bursts in value, creating millionaires overnight, the discovery of a secret internet, and unregulated money (in the hundreds of millions) disappearing out of nowhere in a wild internet heist.  It's good stuff.

You need to incentivize anything for change. The old system WORKS. I mean that in the most basic sense. It's like a steampunk machine with bolts popping out the sides. It's not elegant, its messy.  But we've got our workflow.  Just like how cars WORK.  But we don't see any improvement until a company like Tesla comes along.  
Dogecoin has no incentive.  It's a joke to most Bitcoiners (because, well, it was a joke).  And it definitely looks like a fleeting joke to anyone outside of crypto.  It provides nothing innovative to the crypto concept, and from what you're claiming, it loses value. What's the incentive to be involved in that?
If the point is to create a trust-less, decentralized way of moving value, it's gonna need to provide some incentive.  And in a world where information travels immediately, and people can jump on bandwagons in a split seconds from a viral article (before the 2005, it wasn't uncommon for things to go under the radar.  NOTHING goes under the radar anymore), the value of something will fluctuate quickly because folks are comin' at it like crazy.  
And who cares if it's going up in value? This is what I don't get.  So many people in this community berate Bitcoin because its "get rich quick."  What, should it be get poor quick to succeed?  Is there some engrained necessity of good ideas to suffer?  This part of the Bitcoin narrative boggles my mind.  Go write that novel if you want to suffer for something.
You say Bitcoiners aren't interested because it's not get rich quick.  I'm gonna go out on a limb and guess you actually are saying that you dislike people's confidence that the value will go up.  On that assumption, see everything I said earlier.

Seems like you're not getting what he said. He's not telling women to not do something.  
He's telling men to stop hiring women to be objectified.
Playing on the (majority of) males' ancient programming to look at naked women by paying women to be in these projects perpetuates a cycle of misogyny.  And the worst part is we're doing it for one of two reasons:  vanity and money.  We want people to look at our stuff, and we want to make money from those eyeballs. So we go with the cheapest, easiest, solution:  male biology.  
Women are free to do these or not do these.  Men are free to watch and not watch.
But yes, it's up to men to do something about it because WE are the problem.  We're the ones that need to change, *not women*.  The entire idea behind society is to fight against our programming for the betterment of others, meanwhile mixing in a little competition for growth.  We don't murder, even though we want to.  We don't beat the shit out of our neighbor for pissing us off.  And we, as men, need to transcend objectification.

Quick rush of money?  Did you mean dodgy or doggy?
There's a HUGE chance these coins won't be worth anything and everyone knew that going in. 
Anyone who sent money to them was taking a calculated risk by getting in early to a system that, if the promise is delivered on, will be really interesting to watch unfold.  People think the concept is neat.  They want to support these guys build a decentralized internet protocol. 
Maybe you just don't like that they're coupling a product with potential (assuming they can deliver) with a new alt coin?
To me, if they really created what they claim to have made, then they have found the bitcoin killer: provide a larger and better service that is still decentralized but has its own crypto built in. that's how you kill bitcoin. 
And isn't that what we all want?  Improvements and evolution?

I am 100% behind the torrenting concept.  I love it dearly.  I do.  But its impossible to argue that the foundation of it's success isn't piracy.  I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing in the long run.  Piracy and illegal activity birthed a lot of great things.  Pornography and movie duplication fueled the VHS (and then DVD) rise.  Bitcoin's stress test was almost exclusively on illegal goods for a time.  A lot of good shit has shady pasts that evolve into something greater.  Hell, Facebook was made too basically degrade women.  
VPN, proxies, and Tor are primarily used by thieves though.  It's the illegal usage that creates mass adoption and a HUGE advancement in general privacy. 
Like I was saying earlier, for a product to succeed, it needs to exhibit a HUGE leap over a previous product to consume its market, OR do something illegal that can't be controlled easily.  The entire digital music rise was a response to theft.  It was the right move, it was for the better, but you're kidding yourself if it didn't come from theft.

Satoshi wouldn't know there's a crash coming.  It's market driven. 
A bank doesn't need a crypto.  Cryptos only exist because of the decentralized nature of the system. If BOA wanted to make the Boacoin, they would benefit more from making it not cryptographic.  And they already kind of do that. When your money is at BOA it's sort of a centralized Boacoin.   
If banks could do that, they'd be doing it.  But it doesn't make sense for them or anyone else. They can keep track of their money already.  Bitcoin's core idea is how do you keep track of money globally if no one controls the system. 
I'm getting the impression you're not familiar with some of the technical underpinnings of bitcoin. There's a bunch of YouTube videos that explain it well.

We still need government and taxes right now.  Maybe there's some elegant way to phase it out in the future, but we still need it for so many reasons.  And if people have  a way to avoid taxes, they'll do it.  Right?  The entire idea of Bitcoin is we don't trust each other to do the right thing.  It's a trustless system.  So why would we trust each other to contribute to build roads, develop fire departments, police, etc?  Most people here don't like some (most?) of what the government does, but there's no better existing model, currently.  Nothing that is tested and works for hundreds of millions of people.

I know /Bitcoin loves conspiracy theories, but I highly doubt Apple's motivation was competition.  I think it was not wanting to deal with the customer service spike because of how vulnerable Bitcoin is to theft in it's current form.  I love Bitcoin, but my anxiety has definitely gone up 2 clicks since diving in.  
@_date: 2014-10-29 16:44:55
Agreed.  But if someone was selling something, you'd be in the context of a sale.  
"How much does it cost?"
"4500 bits."
If the context is audio quality and someone says its 16bit or 24bit, because of the context of the numbers, it's easy to assume what they're discussing. Not to mention the people having that conversation are almost definitely savvy to the topic if they're discussing the bit depth of audio (something the average consumer couldn't care less about).
For example, when I'm working in video, I don't say "it's 1080 pixels high of resolution."  I just say, "its 1080" because that number assumes a certain thing.  16 and 24, in the context of audio, refer to something specific.  If I said 44.1 or 48, people know that I'm talking about khz.
I can only assume this logic persists in other industries.

You should join the project and figure out how to integrate Bitcoin into the system, since the current version of Bitcoin won't allow it.  You sound like a passionate person, I bet you could filter that into something constructive!

I disagree.  The media is not on any side.  The media is on the side of good story.  Good as in, which way to the pieces fit that form the simplest, easy to understand narrative.  
Bitcoin's problem is that the core concept, decentralized system not owned by anyone is EXTREMELY hard to understand.  So most folks gloss over that.  They can't just look at the code, because the code is gibberish to them.  Most people LOVE conspiracies, so the idea that a secret creator could have implanted something into the system to steal bitcoins is a much more enjoyable narrative.
Then, when stuff goes wrong, dots begin to connect.  Used for drugs, people use it for ponzi scheme, some economists think its a ponzi scheme (word shows up twice in 2 different contexts, ideas begin to merge).  
Bitcoin as a good thing has a complex narrative, because it's a complex system.  It's Nixon vs Kennedy.  Bad comparison, but you know what I mean.  Bitcoin is NOT camera ready.  Explain TCP/IP to someone right now, without explaining anything built on top of it, and people will probably tell you that its a weird system, too complex, and would fail.  Then, add MONEY to the mix?  Recipe for disaster...

If you have a merchant account and are receiving funds as a merchant, it's business related.  Couldn't that be one way to track it?  
I make purchases on my credit card but track the business transactions.  Buyers could just tag the transactions. Or if you send money to a known seller, it auto tags.  
People can circumvent it easily, sure. But then you're trying to not pay taxes and that's on you.

Because it happened over time and the book keeping was terrible.
The best parallel I've read is, imagine a restaurant that serves burgers from frozen patties. There's someone keep inventory of the frozen patties and someone at the register selling them. A customer figures out a way to get two burgers for the price of one, but at the end of the day no one compares the inventory from the freezer with the sales, because they're incompetent and lazy.  So their inventory is slowly being depleted over a long period of time. Bitcoins siphoned out of cold storage.

Yeah, I mean, I agree with the semantics argument.  Anything can be a currency.  But the discussion is about how a government is dealing with the title of a thing for law-making purposes.  Not a theoretical discussion for a college philosophy course.  Now, if you're in the anarchist camp and don't want the government doing anything at all, then I think the scope of this conversation goes outside the situation we're actually discussing.

Why would a central authority bother creating a "semi-centralized" crypto?  What would the benefit be for a government?  The foundation of the protocol requires it not be controlled by anyone. If someone has control, they might as well just have a Paypal service, which could have been any old time. There's no benefit to the ledger in a centralized system.

Kinda hoping to validate your point through sensationalism, eh?  There are more ways, for the consumer, to permanently lose their Bitcoins than there are ways to lose their Dollars.  Economic ideologies don't really apply here.  It's just easier.  It's why most people don't keep 5k+ of cash on their person or in their home.  It's stupid and dangerous.  
EDIT:  I think the purpose of Bitcoin is to allow people to gain the benefits of the "money under the mattress" with a system that potentially could be more secure than a bank.  But right now, it's less secure than keeping money in a safe for 90% of the population, unfortunately.
@_date: 2014-05-05 01:33:42


Because the people who do the most work, the ones you don't know about, won't get paid.  Take TV writing.  What about the writer's assistants on TV shows?  How are funds getting to them?  And what if you send all of your money to Vince Gilligan even though he didn't actually write 90% of Breaking Bad?  
What if you thought the editing was brilliant?  Pay the editor!  Wait, the editor actually changed 3 times in finishing, and he was just the last one to touch the movie.  AND to make matters worse, the producer was sitting over his shoulder the entire time.  So the producer actually oversaw the majority of the cut, the editor just kinda pushed buttons (it happens).  
The VFX team was amazing!  Wait, which team, though?  Hydraulx did all of the screen comping effects and the fire effects, MPC did all of the clean-up (which you'll never notice if done correctly), and BUF did all of the character animation.  You're going to dissect all of that to make a fair decision as to who gets what?  You can't just send the money to "VFX."
It seems unfair that people who don't know how the industry works get to be the payment distributor.  "The receptionist at the doctor's office was really sweet and got me in right away, but the surgeon was a little snippy with me.  I'm gonna send all of my money to reception." When it's entertainment, folks just don't take it as seriously, even though 30-100 necessary people are involved (that's NOT including the studio execs, distribution, and the "suits").
I agree, **we need a new system**.  I completely agree with you there.  But making a movie is like building a bridge.  It takes a lot of people with a lot of skills in a lot of departments to create the final product.  There's a LOT of fluff in the pipeline, no one would disagree with you there.  Executives being paid for shit they're not doing.  Distributors in unqualified positions.  
It'd be better to find a system that doesn't just give money to the wrong departments on the grounds of a misdirected and fleeting excitement you had while watching the credits roll.

Films like CLERK'S are a misconception.  If you do a breakdown of their budgets, they're often given a LOT of free things.  Free locations, use of equipment, often times film was donated to productions.  People donating their time.  Talent worked for free.  And really, Clerk's looked pretty blah.  On top of it all, for every 1 CLERKS, there were thousands of embarrassing productions that never went anywhere and burned their money.  This is because every time you cut money from the budget, you taking a chance that there's a really talented person willing to work for free (or low).  Each time, you're taking a bigger risk of tanking your whole production.

I work in entertainment (post production) in Los Angeles. Most people steal sound libraries and pass them around. BUT if the sound effects portion of this site became beefier, had a solid indexing system, the recording quality was high and well recorded, and the sound effects cost something like a penny each, I could totally see people using this, and folks actually would monetize on it.

Agreed. Things like Facebook and Twitter would benefit from the lack of censorship, but that's probably not enough to get the majority interested unless it has additional functionality.  
The ones that could potentially take over are things that charge money and take cuts to run the service.  Like Kickstarter, Etsy, eBay.  They'll also have the underlying benefit of no censorship in addition to no service costs.

I completely agree with what you're saying.  The internet is still a strange new place where old laws don't quite fit.  I work in the film industry in Los Angeles, and the same way file-sharing is requiring us to rethink our copyright and IP laws, something entirely new is emerging with blockchain technology. Everything will eventually come to an undeniable confrontation.  
My original thought in writing the post was a hope that developers would not preach all decentralized technology as a way to hide from/undermine/circumvent the government, but instead point out the larger capabilities (which the privacy from government does fall under).  The fanatically anti-government are a universal turn-off, except to fringe groups.

If Satoshi sells off, more folks will buy in at the bottom and the game begins anew.  Bitcoin will drop because of bad news and sell-offs. It'll fail due to cracks in its structural integrity.  And it's shown to be pretty damn resilient thus far. 
About the greed... I agree. People love money. Which is why if the price drops a LOT, folks will dive in. Calculated greed keeps the hamster wheel spinning. 
I guess what I'm getting at is, if the machine is sound, greed will keep it running forever.  You might lose money now. It might drop to 10 bucks. Who knows. But it'll just keep going again and again and again until AnonymousOneSecondConfirmation4mbBlockchainCoin comes out.

I do agree, telling people to hide their beliefs isn't a good thing. But I tend to stop listening to people who constantly drone on about their beliefs. There is a "we get it" threshold. And if it's inhibiting progress it might be worth it some to considering toning it down. They don't have to, and I'd never tell someone what to do because I know how aggravating it is to be commanded to do something. 
I do believe pointing out that people tire of hearing that tirade is beneficial.

I don't think you're answering my question.  You're doing the ol' tech forum thing of answering questions with, "Why would you even want to do a thing like that?"
I'm saying, companies are actually doing it.  Right now.  But I'm having trouble understanding what exactly they claim to be doing.  
If they're creating a new blockchain where they're in control, then they might as well just make something like Amazon Dollars that are central.  In which case, they could have done that 20 years ago. 
If they're making a normal blockchain, then they're giving up control, in which case they won't benefit financially (in the long term) and might as well not do it.

Great argument. I really like the use of "wrong" and how it deconstructs the issue to its core. I found each of the 6 words well considered and extremely powerful in defending the stance. 
I've been on the fence about whether or not eBay adoption would be good for the bitcoin community for the past many months. I've been pulled in both directions on the issue, hearing some intelligent but digestible arguments supporting both sides. 
What I found most enlightening was the use of a grammatical negative preceding the word "positive."  The mere juxtaposition caused my mind to ignite. This went deeper than I could have ever imagined!  "Not a positive FOR bitcoin."  For it. FOR it. It's connection to specifically bitcoin. 
I suggest everyone take the time to read these 6 words and take them in deeply. Really let each syllable marinate. And then go back and do it again 5 or 6 times.  It's the only way to extract the full intention of this, yes I'll say it, MANIFESTO.

Bitcoin is also a complete mess in terms of usability. Bitcoiners and contrarians can get in a chicken-and-egg discussion all day, too.  
It'll creep in slowly.  I half agree with what you're saying. Mass adoption can't be about shoving bitcoin down people's throats.  Giving people Bitcoin is preachy.  Tell them why they need it causes resistance.  
Best thing to do?  Just insert it everywhere in terms of knowledge.  Don't come to the table ever expecting anyone to actually use it. Just understand it.  The folks who see the potential will adopt and develop for it (like we're seeing).  Then the people who are just learning about it won't have such a polarized view.  Polarization happens with expectation.  
"You WILL like this technology."
"Oh will I?  Fuck off."
Don't tell folks what to do, and folks will learn in time.
But again, Bitcoin is a mass-adoption mess.  There's no reason for a consumer to use it, so there's no reason for a business to accept it.
Just keep making it sexier, and folks will come to it slowly.

I'm super intrigued by this avenue.  What I love is a distro channel where the interface distributes the funds without a central corporation taking a cut.  It's the holy grail of distribution.  The problem is that there's no way for anyone to control how many copies of the film are on PcT.  Just make a new copy that doesn't charge and everyone will just use that.  
Someone figure out a way to keep control of digital content, and that would be absurdly amazing.  I believe in copyright reform, but I also believe that the original production shouldn't be distributed without the creators consent if they don't want it to.  It's theirs to do what they want with.

From what I've seen, people are hyper-aware of when Bitcoin starts centralizing.  Like this conversation we're having right now.  And a post on the front page right now.  We're literally having this discussion this very second, as are many people in other threads. 
You're not special or unique in your view.  And that's exactly why I'm not afraid of people blindly following a meme meant to point out the passivity of the protocol.
The people who have Bitcoin don't benefit from it centralizing.  Quite the opposite.  There's an engrained motivation to track it in the open to prevent their investment from devaluing.  
Can't say that for a company like Google (I like Google, mind you).

Hey man. Another editor in LA here. I'm in WeHo and work out of editorials in SM normally.  I work in national commercial, doc, and feature editing. Over at the Blackwelder complex this month. 
Lemme know if you want a hand.  Could pool contacts.  I have wanted to help the community but my shoddy programming skills have made me feel impotent. 
I agree, I think we need to make the success narrative clear.  
EDIT:  We need to separate Bitcoin from the extremist Libertarians, or the extremist Anyones.  Sorry guys, I love ya, I sincerely do.  But this is a technology for the public to build on without ANYONE telling them what to do. It's not supposed to just be a vessel for a political agenda.  We need to show what the potential is for the future. To show what the foundation allows for. 
Probably shouldn't defend against the drug/ponzi accusations directly. The best defense is no defense in this case. You make people feel smart when they draw their own conclusions. It's why one trope of nerds is that they're always arguing. They're telling each other the best way to do things. No one wants to be told what to do, people want to figure things out on their own. You convey how the Bitcoin protocol is gate into a new realm of thought, a brand new set of tools to build with, and people will understand why it was used for drugs, but what the POTENTIAL is for it later. Working in narrative storytelling has made this clear project after project.  No one wants to be told what the story is, they want it revealed to them in a way that they feel like they're noticing the details and constructing their own conclusions.  That's the storyteller's goal. And that's what we need to do here.

Also, let's be realistic.  Bitcoin is too unstable for crime/terrorist transactions.  There's better, more efficient methods that already exist that are cleanly integrated into whatever it is they do.  Why adopt a new form of currency that fluctuate wildly to perform high-volume transactions?  These types are dealing with LARGE sums of money.  They're more likely to be burned.  And by the time Bitcoin stabilizes, I doubt it'll be really good for this sort of stuff anyway because it'll probably be regulated heavily.

What about campaigns like "Got Milk?" And "Beef, it's what's for Dinner."  
Those are iconic campaigns that aren't explicitly for anything except the commodity. 
I agree, these publicity stunts don't necessarily explain Bitcoin well. But that's also the community's fault for not making some things clear in a few short sentences. People need incentivizing to learn. Be it "I can make money mining?" or a more asbtract incentive like the weird draw people have to negative stories (Gox crumbling, China bans).  These are two examples of things people are drawn to that completely misrepresent Bitcoin. We do need an ad campaign. And it needs to be done in a way that makes crystal clear the important stuff. Not mining, not making money, not volatility, not speculation.

The TED talk on "git democracy" and some stuff I've read about liquid democracy has really got my brain going on how great this could all be.  
It's easy for this discussion to devolve into ideological banter when libertarians can nitpick a discussion.  And on paper they're totally right.

In the case of cash, one person is trying to rob a mark.  In the case of bitcoin, there can be an almost infinite amount of simultaneous marks.  "Treat it like cash" is a bit of a cop-out.  With cash, I can just hide it in a safe in the floorboards.  I don't need to be aware of the infrastructure of new technology that's still in BETA.  There are so many moving parts, and each of them contains a vulnerability.
Buy bitcoins securely.  Download a linux USB live drive.  Get a copy of bitaddress.org's javascript.  Load the linux partition and copy it over, and remember not to connect to the internet.  Print the wallet to a printer that has no access to the internet or memory or internal hard drive.  Move the money into the wallet.  Hide that under your mattress.  
Slightly more complex.  
Let me know note, I had a blast doing it.  I think it's some fun James Bond shit.  And I feel like a rockstar when I pull money out of cold storage like I'm detonating a nuclear warhead.  But, it's got a ways to go before it's accessible to my roommate's boyfriend.

Yeah that last bit is what confuses me. 
The point of bitcoin is that eventually it can be developed into things.  It's a way for different companies to communicate in the same language without trusting each other.  The digital currency thing only works if I can store my crypto in places other then Facebook. Otherwise, how is this different than PayPal with different services parameters?

Here's what confuses me.  If a hacker steals your money, the bank is just claiming responsibility in our current banking scenario.  So the hacker gets the money, you get your money back, and the bank/government takes a hit.  Other people who use the services are also paying into a pot to pay out the people who get robbed.  Right?  Instead of one person losing the money, twice the amount is being spent to protect the innocent from robbery.  
I do agree, though.  In the current incarnation, Bitcoin is NOT ready for primetime.  That could be why the protocol is still technically in beta.  We're all just accepting a giant risk by being involved because we believe in it's potential (or want to monetize on its massive volatility).
I'm genuinely sorry that you lost that money, though.  No buts or ifs or jabs.  That's really a bummer.
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:56:55
Disagree entirely.  Merchant adoption is vastly more important than anything else.  The zealots holding bitcoin will be zealots no matter what.  But merchants need to learn that they're not assuming any risk. Their adoption needs to be seamless and no-risk.  They have the opportunity to ONLY benefit.
So let the people who want and have a big ol' pile of bits to use them. Let those who don't care about it not use it. Let the interested consumers take on the instability risks for now.  
As more merchants adopt BTC, there will be more reason for normal people to receive bitcoin for work, or from a friend for splitting a meal, or as a gift.

Agreed.  Because Internet business has no physical location, it causes a faster natural monopoly. 
Facebook has no real competition.  Twitter, Amazon, Google, Steam, etc.  They have competition, but no one is on equal footing, like when there where physical shops.  The only way competition works for Internet business is dethronement.  Facebook will only be replaced by someone providing a new service either they can't, or didn't think was important.  They have to be enveloped.  
There are more natural monopolies now than ever.

People seed torrents for incentive.  Ratios, private tracker perks, the general monetary gain derived from piracy (not spending money on a movie/song/software is basically income).  Or sometimes just plain forgetting to turn them off after they've been downloaded.  There's definitely people in there doing it strictly for ideology, but its dwarfed by the personal gain.
Also, the economists are making long term predictions.  We still have a lot of time to see if its going to succeed.  I'm not mining because I know I won't get anything out of it and it'll cost me too much money (and it'll kill my system).

Good and evil are moral decisions and specifically attributed to sentient beings. Not inanimate objects, like Bitcoin. The point is that it's decentralized. It's to emphasize the fact that it is, in contrast to Google (the counterpart to the satire), not a corporation making moral or amoral choices.  Bitcoin is not responsible for outcomes, people are.

There's nothing you can compare Bitcoin to right now (apart from its billions of clones).  Nothing with any worthwhile track record, anyway.  It can't be anything but speculation. 
The "value" thing has been disputed into the ground.  Value is perception.  We agree government has power.  We agree to let government give money value.  Therefore, we agree money has value.  Like everything.  Bottle caps, WoW gold, tulips, gold.  I'm pretty convinced the "intrinsic value" discussion has been tied up nicely with a bow by this point.  
Bitcoin isn't stable, sure.  It's a goddam rollercoaster trainwreck mess.  As is most things in their infancy.  The difference with Bitcoin vs a company (which is what we're really only capable of comparing this to) is that companies can crumble under insults, attacks, critiques, etc.  As long as a handful of users hold belief in bitcoin, it has some level of value. That's interesting to me.  
And unlike a standard product (a Segway, for instance), it has the ability to truly evolve.  I can make improvements to my Segway, but one bad product line can really tank a company.  Improvements to Bitcoin's infrastructure is in the best interest of the community, and doesn't require me to purchase a new Segway to enjoy it.  That's also interesting.
The "bitcoin is a fantasy" comment is just sort of a blanketed attack with no real aim, so I don't think it needs addressing.

My fiancé's father passed away a little while ago from cancer.  She had an understandly hard time coping so she started writing a book about the experience during it. Last week she finished it and released it online.  I know this kinda thing isn't for everyone but when you're going through hard times it's nice to know you're not alone.  That others have been down this same road and made it through.
I feel one of the greatest parts of Bitcoin is the donation economy it creates, so I told her to start accepting them on her site.  
She always asked what was practical about bitcoin, and I think donations is one of it biggest strengths right now.  So if you think this is something you might relate to, give it a go.

Yeah, I tend to agree, there will always be a way to steal it.  There needs to be a simple, easy way to pay for it.  Or micropay for what you've watched.  I kinda mention that [here](
But I also don't think tipping is the way to go, because of [here](
I think, maybe, the big fear is that we'll realize films aren't sustainable.  Who's going to front 400 million dollars, 300m, 200m, 100m for a summer tent-pole flick without some sort of roadmap to a return on investment?  Hell, 40m or 10m for a medium budget.  Or 1m for a low budget.  
If you can't determine your own prices, if movies (and tv in some ways) are subject to strictly market value, how could you predict sales to investors?  No one wants to invest in something that risky.  We get good movies because there's a definable return, a calculable risk.  
A musician can produce an album in a basement.  A painter can just paint.  An author writes.  A filmmaker assembles a team of no less than 5 (but upwards of 50) people to make something.  So unless you want every movie out there to be "found footage," there's going to be a much higher production cost.  
Movies are a strange beast.  You have a ton of labor + resources used to produce something that is, ultimately, intangible.  It has no distribution costs (in the most basic sense).  If you can't guarantee domestic, overseas, home video/VOD sales, then why would anyone give a filmmaker money for that?  Your chances increase with pre-existing IPs, sequels, etc.  But who's going to give money to a somewhat unknown filmmaker to produce a spec?

I completely agree with you. I can't in good faith suggest people use it because it's way to difficult to deal with. 
You know what would be incredibly ballsy but potentially interesting?  What if you did an honest marketing campaign?
Bitcoin:  We're not ready yet, but we will be. 
Express its potential use cases, but also straight up say "don't use it. You're not ready for it."
"Protects your identity, but is kinda confusing... for now."
"Target can't have your Bitcoins stolen by accident... but wait a bit to adopt it.  You can't handle it yet."
Advertising doesn't have to be about attractive women eating candy bars on the beach. Impressions in marketing are what's important. We don't need to show all of the brilliant ways Bitcoin is important while glossing over the bad stuff. Marketing is about awareness.  Eyeballs. And what makes Bitcoin important is its potential.  There can be honesty in advertising. And when there is, people notice. Probably because it's so rare. 
I've never seen a company say "don't use us."  In a weird way, it'd be extremely original for an outdoor and television marketing campaign.  And could be very compelling.

Gold isn't as granular and can't move as quickly.  Has there ever been an asset that is granular, can move immediately anywhere in the world, and can be used as both a store of value or fast transfer of value?  But isn't controlled by a single entity?
I see what you mean, and there's definitely no extensive track record for Bitcoin in this area, like gold.  But there's probably not nearly enough conclusive data right now to even begin to project how a truly decentralized cryptocurrency would fluctuate with mass adoption in the future.
And that's the fun part.

Honestly though. In all seriousness. It just points out that companies/corporations are capable of (and require to) making decisions that can be open to moral interpretation, while advancements in smart protocols and DACs could someday lead to a lot of similar decisions being completed by systems without the need for a central human element. 
Bitcoin isn't making a decision if an insurgent group in X country deserves to have their accounts frozen.  It isn't deciding whether or not it thinks someone is a whistleblower or committing treason. 
PayPal can be good or evil. Bitcoin can't. 
The idea of moral choice applies more to the transfer of value than, say, butt plugs.  
For the record, I'm morally for butt plugs and cock rings.

Agreed.  But we're discussing whether or not a thing that isn't a company should advertise. 
And if someone isn't familiar with something, isn't that exactly when you DO advertise? 
Advertising isn't just about selling a hamburger in the moment.  The creators of those ads aren't thinking "Man, this'll make people go out and buy a burger!"  It's that, when the time comes, and they're THINKING about burgers, they validate one over the other.  They trust one product over another because the campaign has created a feeling of comfort.  The average person will choose the one that appears safer in most cases.  
Bitcoin is a narrative disaster and publicly untrustworthy.  If it was WERE a company, a fixer would be in there firing everyone on the top floor.  
So, the goal, I'd imagine is to figure out a way to tell people "Look, here's this thing that isn't going anywhere because its built by YOU, not a company.  It's something that will someday save you a lot of money, and will revolution transactions."

Heh, I had a great experience outside of a restaurant in Florida.  Was explaining to someone how Bitcoin is still ugly and in it's infancy, and how the idea behind the blockchain is revolutionary.  Explained that programmable money will change everything.  Then someone I didn't know, who wasn't in the conversation, dipped in and said:
"You know that the CEO of Bitcoin stole them all and the government seized them, right?"
"Oh yeah?"
"Yeah, its all over."
"Geez, good to know!"
I just let him tell us the whole story of the government seizure of *all* the Bitcoins.  Although I have to admit, his mangled, completely wrong news story about Bitcoin was so much more interesting than what I was saying.

When you preach, you command.  When you command, people don't listen.  Studies show that when someone presented hard facts that run contrary to their personally held values, they become MORE rigid in their personal beliefs.  To advance ideologies and spread knowledge, you must allow people to make their own decisions, allow them to come to their own conclusions.  The moment you tell someone their stance is wrong, you've lost them.  
(Note, I'm keeping my opinion of government to myself on the matter as it's irrelevant and distracting from the discussion)

is right that lack of women in certain industries are almost entirely due to insufficient encouragement at a young age.  It's extremely well documented.  
Another example of this is in entertainment. Women are rarely screenwriters, directors, DPs, etc.  But they heavily populate the executive portion of film and television.  This is because of the different tracks men and women are eased into at a young age.  It's previous generations of suppression seeping through.  
Of course, this is also changing.  We're seeing more and more women in the industry each year.  
One interesting profession in Hollywood is film editors.  Film editors were almost exclusively women back in the day because of it's clerical nature.  It was an extension of being a secretary.  But as the editing technology became more digital/technical/computerized, it became inundated with men.
To me, the problem is in the mindset.  There are many people that want to believe the best way to be truly neutral is to pretend there's no difference, no issue.  Ignore the past, clean slate, move forward.  Everyone works on their own merit.  This goes for race issues as well.
Problem is, this is ignoring a few extremely important things:  men and women are not the same.  Our relationship to each other is extremely complex, biological, societal, etc.  
We can't transcend race and gender by just ignoring them. The unfortunate reality is that fear and prejudices are hard-coded in our DNA.  We have to acknowledge them, face them, stare at them, all the time.  Constantly evaluating our actions.  Even when race becomes a blur from generations of marriage and children, we'll find another group to be confused and afraid of.  
We have to be human, not robots.  There's no set of parameters, laws, rules, to resolve this kind of thing.  Emotions aren't rational.  They don't abide by rules.  And emotion dictates a lot of how these discussion go, and subsequently how people are treated.

I work in national advertising, and live in Los Angeles.  I work one or two superbowl spots a year.  If I'm here, there's gotta be others in the industry. 
Lotta multisig wallets coming out.  Maybe there's a way to donate to that to keep some clown from running off with funds, then buy some ad time when the time comes.
The only difference is that dogecoin does it because its kinda funny.  Bitcoin, just by its nature, runs the risk of coming across preachy.  We'd need to come up with a really good way to come across as not preachy, but not sadly comedic either (like a christian youth group doing a rap to appear funny or hip).  Tough balance, but doable.  
Or, Bitcoin should just embrace what it's seen as, which is taking itself seriously.  Own that personification.  Dogecoin is fun, goofy.  The class clown.  Now that you've seen that, here's Bitcoin, the system that could potential create a new backbone for financial transactions.  The original Blockchain.  The thing with the real professional backing.  Don't be comedic, be professional.  Dogecoin wears a hawaiian shirt and tevas, Bitcoin wears a suit.

The entire point is that you can't objectively explain it.  Which is why the price is left up to the free market (Bitcoiners LOVE the free market, right?). 
If you could objectively explain art, then all art would be good.  There'd be a formula to follow for success, which there isn't. If there was, you'd be out making tons of money instead of railing on someone for putting themselves out there. 
The value of art is a combination of how it makes you feel, how it makes the creator feel, and who the creator is.
There's nothing more pathetic than someone who tells other people why they shouldn't enjoy something.

Exactly.  And Bitcoin doesn't have to be about politics.  It's the honey badger of money, as they say.  It doesn't care.  
And that goes for your political agenda, whatever it is. 
You have the political agenda, not Bitcoin.
People should know what Bitcoin's potential is for everyone. From my understanding, as multi-sig becomes universal, as more decentralized systems are created, as Bitcoin 2.0 grows, everyone benefits.  It's not just privacy from our governments.  It's the choice of privacy (and security) from everyone. Period.

I'm sure this can be argued to death, but IMO society's purpose is to take care of citizens. 
The core of society, it's birth, was to enforce a social contract that if I don't kill you, you don't kill me. It was about base survival. 
So the natural extension of societal advancement is protecting citizens while allowing people to do what they want. 
So the balancing act is deciding should the government protect people from themselves?  Probably not. Should they protect people from other people who have lost control?  Probably. And in a society where people are financially dependent on others, you need to take into account the cost of addiction. 
Managing addiction (as some argue) is a more complex layer. That's hyper-regulation of substances to protect and respect those already addicted.  
Personally I'd rather live in a regulated controlled society where policy makers and government figures are forced into heavy accountability.  We're not there yet by far. But that doesn't mean anarchy or libertarianism is the answer for me.

I don't really see why a bailout is SO hated by the community. I get that people don't like Mt. Gox, but we're talking about it's members, our community.
I wonder if there's a way to let Mt. Gox die, transfer the debt to a new company who's willing do a sort of transferred bail-out by loaning old members the money, and then collecting a percentage over time.  
That, adding to it some donations from the community itself.  I'm sure there's a ton of OMFG NO WHY I DO THAT LET IT FAIL folks, but there's definitely a bunch (myself included) that would donate to help get some of these people their money back.  The folks cathartically looking for Mt. Gox and it's members to lose everything as some sort of 2008 Bank Bailout effigy aren't going to budge on their opinion, which is the beauty of Bitcoin IMO.  They get to have that opinion.
That said, I'd like to help.  And that's my choice as a member of a community.

Friction also plays a role in value, right?  So if you can move the money extremely fast, I think that technically lowers value.

The exchange happens slowly in phases. So it's not going to be a fast trading platform. It's a slow escrow service to assure that a safe exchange of value happened. 
You also need to have Bitcoin to make trades.  Both sides put money in escrow to have some level of assurance that the transactions happen.

That's not a balanced comparison.  I see what you're getting at, but in all probability a flubbed email will cause embarrassment.  At best it doesn't matter, at worst you might send your personal info or bank info to someone.  The latter is rare.  
But with Bitcoin, the best situation is you lose a little money, the worst is you lose a lot of money, and its an even increase throughout that continuum.  Having an automated mailing system freak out is vastly less problematic than having a automated Bitcoin transactions freak out.  


Once you start adding in these sort of conditions, the system gets exponentially less convenient.   


I do agree with this.  I think this is because the amount of money at stake is much lower in a vending machine.  There's less concern about a lost candy bar than 500 dollars being eaten.  Difference between Bitcoin and ATMs, though, is banks are responsible for their upkeep.  Bitcoin ATMs operate more like vending machines, I'd imagine.

What's tumblr feminism?
@_date: 2015-07-19 17:19:39
To be fair, feminism is egalitarianism. Feminism believes that in the current social and political climate, woman are treated as lower due to lingering outdated perceptions of societal gender roles.  It's the belief that laws stating equality do not override tribalism. 
It's the belief that to evolve as a society of equals, we have to accept that things are constantly in flux, and that "society" as a concept is a direct fight against "nature."  
It's the belief that we are not equal yet, and that it takes conscious, thoughtful, aware effort to overcome inequality and imbalance.
It's accepting that "I ignore gender and so should everyone else" is not the way to overcome gender issues. Pretending there are no differences does not solve problems. It hides them behind the theory of equality. 
Feminism is about being conscious of the problem, and accepting that there will never be a point in the future where we are "blind to sexism and racism" because those two things are extensions of tribalism, which is part of our survival programming.  And society is about intellectually overcoming that.

Lemme just revise that useless opening section for you:


~~So, lets assume most of you don't know better and are just repeating nonsense because you heard someone you think knows say it, and lets get into WHY it's actually nonsense.~~
So apart from your SNL IT Guy intro, this is by far the best answer on here (and closest to what OP is looking for). 
I'd be curious to hear more about it.  What I'm curious about is if this would streamline transferring value.  If I want to transfer my money from one place to another, with Bitcoin i can just do it and its fast.  That's a huge plus for everyone, I think.  I wonder if that can be implemented in this.  Seems like it'd be possible, and potentially more secure.
I am curious, though, it doesn't seem to be in a company's best interest to implement this.  Being able to hide mistakes and messes is in a company's best interest.  So what's the incentive to implement a system like this?  
@_date: 2015-04-07 20:08:47
I completely agree with all of that.  Nicely worded.
@_date: 2015-04-07 17:04:40
Then next question becomes, how do you prevent those colored coins from having monetary value?
@_date: 2015-09-07 16:36:24

Very interesting!  I'd be curious to hear more on this.  If Google or IBM built a blockchain that didn't use a currency to secure it, how would the system operate?  (Genuine question!  I'm very curious!)
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:24:34
Feels like you misunderstood my question. 
I'm asking if there's anything out there, white papers, anything, that outlines a system where a FedCoin could exist, and it's actually better than if they just centralized it. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 03:12:36
I think the point is that both are options. You can have a centralized system running on the back of a decentralized system. It gives everyone choices and economic freedom.  I'd 100% use a bitcoin bank if it operated like a normal bank. But knowing that I could pull my funds and put them in my toaster is an option available to me. And I don't need permission. 
@_date: 2015-03-12 22:47:38
Genuine question that I've never seen answered in any satisfactory way.  Is it currently possible, even abstractly, for a blockchain to exist that meets these conditions:
* Value can be transferred securely without the possibility of another party confiscating that value, or at the least, only one single party (government) can confiscate without the fear of *any* other group gaining that control.
* A single entity controls the token supply.
* The entry point to control the supply is adequately secured without fear of a irreparable takeover.
Ignore your libertarian and anarchistic ideals.  Set aside snarky humble-bragging holier-than-thou tech banter.  Pretend you are your villain.  Just ask yourself:  is it even possible to create the coin a government would be happy with?
I cannot for the life of me figure out, even abstractly, how that could be done.
@_date: 2015-03-16 16:17:19
Because it's not done yet.  Festival cuts aren't final cuts.  They're usually rushed to hit festival deadlines, so they often have unlicensed stock music and footage.  They're also rarely the cut the director is happy with. 
They'll gauge the response from the audience and make additional changes.  There's probably a couple more months of edit.
They'll want to make sure they've cut the most engaging possible form of the documentary that conveys the message the strongest.

I like to think the purpose of this sub is to talk about how to implement Bitcoin as a protocol into different things.  Saying "just use paypal" seems counterproductive.  You could use paypal, sure.  Everyone knows that.  
Even if Bitcoin is the wrong choice, discussing why it's the wrong choice is also more constructive than "but use paypal."
@_date: 2015-03-03 00:44:24
I believe it's probably that it goes against the majority of economists' accepted views on what makes a currency successful. 
When it really comes down to brass tacks, I think the majority of economists believe a centralized group needs to be able to control the flow of money and create a slow inflation.  
The majority of economists don't believe systems like the gold standard are the strongest solution.

It doesn't matter what they said outright. It's what they implied. What was stated was, this is not a currency.  What they implied was, we'll be watching what you use this for. Store owners in China are already pulling out from accepting Bitcoin. Probably because they're reading between the lines.

For me, I'm wondering what the Chinese government means by what they said.  Everyone seems to be explaining why it should be interpreted as a good thing.
I guess what I'm asking is, what did they mean by saying it can be used in exchanges, but not as a currency.  What does that statement mean?  I feel like people keep explaining how it COULD be interpreted as a good thing.  But why say it at all?  Why make the distinction if its not actually going to affect anything?

As soon as you make the transaction, the network will broadcast it and the merchant will see it's gone through (as an unconfirmed TC).  
Someone correct me if I'm wrong, but my understanding is that for small transactions, an unconfirmed tx is fine because the probability is so low that someone would bother to risk cheating the network.

The difference here is stealing media is actually On-The-Books illegal.  You download a movie or a book or a song, you're stealing, plain and simple, no matter what internal validation you make up (movies are too expensive, I don't like their business model, I'm making a difference by stealing and enjoying their content!).
Bitcoin isn't illegal.  Who knows what will happen, but right now, in normal reality (not in conspiratorial black-cloaked fiction) it's legal, and it's prospering.

I think what this person is looking for is a way to import the entire deterministic watch-only wallet. So if more addresses are created, or even change addresses, you'd still see them. 
I don't know a way to do that, but it would be great. 
Electrum lets you do the offline wallet and is a lightweight wallet. So you don't need the entire blockchain. But that doesn't resolve the "view it online" issue. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 22:51:40
But everyone is spread over different banks, different services, different countries.  Wouldn't there be a level of coordination required to even attempt to do this?  I don't know if I agree that the opportunity has been there, and it definitely hasn't been there in this sort of scope.  
@_date: 2013-11-10 07:29:36
One possible draw to an online wallet in the future might be making purchases in person from your phone through a service like Coinbase.  Or Blockchain (which is sort of really a local wallet, sorta). But I'd think of them like a real-world wallet where you'd hold 30 or 40 bucks. 
Then use a software local wallet for holding a bit more money.  
And then if you have a real piles of coins, throw it in a paper wallet. Or cold storage in Armory on a USB or offline machine.

A wallet is a collection of addresses and keys.   Think of a wallet as a bank and the keys as bank accounts. Except the entire bank is yours.

Right now, people join mining pools to find coins/write to the ledger/etc.

I had thought this was somehow connected to Armory.  I felt like I was getting this A LOT more when I was running it, particularly in 10.9.  I've had it happen twice a day in some cases.  At the very least, it happens 3 times a week to me.  I don't need to download the whole blockchain, it just needs to reindex. 
Edit:  I started using Armory about the time I upgraded to Maverick, so it could be the upgrade and not Armory.  Or it could be a combination of the 3.  Not sure.  But it definitely was happening a lot.

Online poker was always technically illegal. The online poker companies claimed to operating a "legal grey area" while government agencies built a case against them.  They always knew they were kind of doing something wrong.  It was never actually legal. 
Bitcoin IS LEGAL.  Taking something AWAY from people that they're allowed to have is a much different beast than taking away something they kinda-sort knew they shouldn't have had in the first place.

Do consider that the largest country in the world is out for the time being, potentially forever.  That's kinda new.  Also, Bitcoin has crashed in the past, but it's a lot more popular lately.

Actually, there sort of is, maybe?  I do know that buried in the protocol is a way for 2 people to have to okay a transaction instead of one.  So there's kind of an escrow service built in.

I think the point here is that Bitcoin comes from a mentality that leans pretty libertarian/anarchist.  Live and let live.  Evolve, and let the chips fall where they may. 
So to make a statement that implies a command (like, do not use memes), you're sort of going against the entire foundation.  You're vocalizing a desire for other people to do things as you see them. Which, unfortunately, is wrong here. 
No one here is telling you to make memes. So don't tell them not to.
Full Disclosure:  I hate those memes.

@_date: 2013-12-04 07:39:27
You SHOULD be okay.  You can get access to the bitcoin address with just the private key. 
But, wallets create change addresses, so anytime you make a transactions, there may be new addresses with new private keys that you're not seeing.  That's why you should back up the whole wallet and not just the private keys.
Someone chime in if I'm mistaken.

Lottery ticket isn't a great example.  The lottery is kinda stupid.  You're just hoping to be struck by lightning.  
With bitcoin (and the well-designed competitive altcoins, as the case will definitely be in the future) you're capable of actually studying the technology (and even be involved in it's maturity).  You're not just throwing money at a random number generator.  You're buying a piece of a system you believe in.
@_date: 2013-11-11 19:02:32
So after using Amory's amazing feature to signing offline transactions through USB sticks to maintain security, it made me wonder:   Was that system an intended purpose included in the original Satoshi paper (like the other underutilized features available within the Bitcoin protocol)?

@_date: 2013-11-16 02:34:04
Little confused about this whole thing.  Are they proposing that the Bitcoin protocol be rewritten to accommodate?  
If they're not proposing that, and they are building a system that tracks the activity of the current system, then what are we all yammering about?  Assuming libertarian ideals, isn't this just another group building a system that does something around bitcoin (but unfortunately something we don't like)?  
In these situations, don't we just figure out a way to invalidate their system by convoluting it as a whole since we have the majority rule?  If the infrastructure isn't being altered and they can create this right now, the best thing would be to stop yammerin' and figure out how to dilute it.
I think what I wrote sounds more combative than I mean it to.  I'm honestly a little hazy on what exactly is being proposed, even after reading the leak.

My understanding is that you'd have to load the wallet into a service (Coinbase, Multibit, Blockchain.info, etc), kinda nullifying the offline/paper aspect of it.  
In that regard, it's more like a check.  
You could, in theory, load the paper wallet into a live wallet AND keep the paper one, but at that point you're just kind of compromising it.  
@_date: 2013-12-10 02:44:35
Yeah, exactly.
@_date: 2013-11-15 22:20:59
Yeah, but you can't send them unsolicited.  Someone has to specifically ask you to send it, so there's a verbal contract.  If you write something and just send it around town, no one is looking at at because they don't want to be sued.  Except interns and PAs, even though they're technically not allowed to.
@_date: 2013-12-29 03:54:39

@_date: 2013-11-29 01:54:03
Okay, so playing devils advocate.
All three examples you used didn't have the end goal of being currencies.  2 of the 3 weren't global. No restaurant would take tulips, dotcom stock, or houses as currency because they don't granulate. 
AND most important. All three of the things you mentioned don't change. Bitcoin, as a protocol, can evolve with time, and has the financial incentive to improve. 
Bitcoin could be overvalued right now (eh, they almost definitely are.  Hard to argue that).  But they are undervalued for the long game. 
Things going against it are system failings of the core concept, hacking heists, and a lack of a killer app to hide the bitcoin protocol in the way internet protocol is hidden from the user.

haha yeah, this suggestion gets dogged on, but it's gotta start happening.  And it's only going to start if people just do it.  Hopefully exchanges will start using different terms like mBTC.  Not being pretentious nerds and accepting the psychologic and sociological importance of this change is pretty key.  Because almost everyone I talk to says "I missed them boat.  It's too expensive now."  As if you HAVE to buy a Bitcoin.  When you start saying "you can get a fraction of a bitcoin.  Like pennies," they negatively associate that. Like, "I'm spending 100 dollars for a penny?"  
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:03:06
It's all perspective.  
You're saying it's to increase the value so we make more money.  
Or, you could say its so there's more widespread adoption and it helps increase acceptability.  The eventual is for it to become a viable currency.  Volatility is growing pains.  It's gonna happen no matter.

Good lord, don't say "noob."  It's like walking into a business meeting with sweats on.  Doesn't matter if you're making a good point because you sound like you're 19.

And after he said all that nice stuff, too.  That's too bad.

They're holding a senate meeting.

I think the majority of people are in agreement here on this.  Now, GO DO IT WORLD!

Hey all, I'm still working on this, but I wanted to post it.
I grabbed the images from google, so I apologize for the unoriginal IP. 
The idea was to include a piece of paper with the BIP38 passphrase.  Or, if it's traveling by mail, then let them get the card, and I'll email them the passphrase (for safety!).
I wasn't sure how best to sum up the procedure of getting an online or local wallet going.  I might just point them to Blockchain.info or Coinbase (I'm in the US).  Or some other documented website.

BTCJam does this exact thing.  The more social networks and online services you connect to it (to prove your real-life personality and reliability), the higher your rating is.

Bitcoin is the best possible choice for garage sales sales!  So come on by Los Angeles people!

Devs are working on this.

I think this is a really, really good question.  
Obviously, grammar nitpicking goofs will criticize the "can I" aspect of your question.  But it's such a good question.  Because yeah, it does seem like this was an ideological project formed by anti-establishment folks.  Libertarians, folks trying to tear down the current system and try something different/better/new/worse.  
If you think the technology is promising and you can see how it fits into the paradigm you respect and like, then it's for you.

Sound rhetorical.  
Maybe tell them about it?

M-of-n transactions feel like a secret weapon for bitcoin.  It's such a powerful part of the protocol.

You lost everyone on earth's interest around "testnet."  I agree with the OP, there needs to be a GUI simulator.

She agreed that it was apt.
