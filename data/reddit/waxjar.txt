good point, if you'd spend the coins quickly enough, the network wouldn't know those were stolen coins, i suppose.

I don't think I'd spend my money on a smartphone with an Internet connection if I lived in a 3rd world country. I'd rather spend my monies on education, a house or other basic needs. 
@_date: 2011-06-30 23:14:46
I think you should take some economy classes.

Are you sure there was trading going on? If you open a second terminal with a direct telnet connection, you can check wether that's the case or not. Opening a direct telnet connection:
    telnet bitcoincharts.com 27007

I turned it into a ruby gem. If you type 'sudo gem install trades', you can run the script from anywhere by just typing 'trades' in the command line. Or 'trades mtgoxusd' of course.

what?

They could have send a "we received your request for re-enabling your account" message at least. I'm curious how many fake requests they've received, with the whole userbase floating around on the web.
@_date: 2011-06-28 17:56:35
Good to hear. :) I made some changes recently, so your gem might be out of date. To update just type `gem update trades` (or `sudo gem update trades`).
@_date: 2011-06-28 16:32:25
I wrote and tested the script with Ruby 1.9.2. That might have something do to with it.

i think your definition of basic need is different than mine, which renders this discussion useless. i don't think you're seriously claiming that without a cell phone, you wouldn't be able to survive. if you do, i propose we agree to disagree.
also, i fail to see what me 'being on bitcoin' (?) has anything to do with this discussion.
@_date: 2011-06-15 21:46:50
Bitcoin has been designed specifically to avoid person B, the man in the middle if I understand everything correctly. Also, what's in it for person B?
@_date: 2011-06-28 00:15:24
That's weird, do you know which version of Ruby you have?
@_date: 2011-06-15 17:21:48
[There's a website for that]( It's slow (and sometimes unreachable) for me as well, but I believe that's due to the ddos. 
@_date: 2011-06-22 21:06:07
as jwiz said, i didn't receive anything after i was done providing my proof.
@_date: 2011-06-28 04:31:57
You're right. That's an ugly mistake and I'll change that as soon as I have time to change it.
As fot the x00 prefix, I didn't see those myself when i fetched the raw data with a telnet connection. I did some searching and apparantly it is [a null character]( I'm not sure if the exception is raised because of the prefix, or that it splits \x00 and the {...} part. The JSON parser seems to hang on an empty string. I'll look into this as well and update the gem.
@_date: 2011-06-15 22:15:39
So, did someone sent you some?
@_date: 2011-07-07 21:36:50
that doesn't make it [basic need]( sure, they're damn handy for all kinds of things, yet they're still luxury goods.
@_date: 2011-06-28 01:29:36
It's not the same. This script gives realtime trade data from several exchanges, not the ticker data from Mt. Gox. Its output looks like this:  It's a useful alias, though.
@_date: 2011-06-16 11:26:25
they give each account a number like 62P56W MTGOX 44404X. that one is probably for you specifically, so when they see that in their bank account, they know it is from you.
@_date: 2011-07-07 20:31:25
Eh. No. They are not.
@_date: 2011-06-27 23:05:11
Do you have Rubygems installed? If not, you can get it [here]( Installation instructions are on the page as well, near the bottom.
When Rubygems is installed, you can install the json gem. Open a terminal window and type:
    gem install json
If you get an error, try
    sudo gem install json
I guess i should have made this script into a gem as well, so it would automatically download and install the json dependency. I'll see how that works and i might update stuff a bit.
@_date: 2011-07-07 16:04:33
not really?
besides, i doubt there's a lot of useful educational material on the internet in the languages spoken in 3rd world countries. the vast majority of websites is written in languages spoken in (semi) developed countries. i'd rather invest in proper education.
@_date: 2011-06-22 19:32:46
the networks authority, so that would be the collective.
@_date: 2011-06-28 16:58:38
Thanks. I fixed the script now, the source is on Github:  If you have further comments, please let me know :)
@_date: 2011-06-28 00:33:37
Rubygems.org has a great guide: 
@_date: 2011-06-20 21:16:26
I'm having similar problems. After about 10 minutes or so, the client won't download any new blocks. It just hangs, even though there are connections. Would anyone know a solution?
Edit: I forwarded the ports in my router.
@_date: 2011-06-27 23:34:41
Hmm, what if you type this at line 1 of the script and run it?
    require 'rubygems'
@_date: 2011-06-21 19:14:02
I have an IRC log of the  channel on freenode. If you want it, i can put it online somewhere for you. There are a lot of join/part/quit messages in there as well though and I don't think it's of much use if there's already a JSON logfile thing.
@_date: 2011-06-27 22:17:49
[The script on Github]( I turned the script into a Ruby gem. To install it, first install Rubygems if you haven't already. Instructions are here:  Next type:
   sudo gem install trades
To run the script type:
    trades
Or if you only want to see trades from specific exchanges:
    trades mtgoxUSD thUSD britcoinGBP
You can specify as many exchanges as you want. Just make sure you use the same name Bitcoincharts uses.
If you just run the script, replace 'trades' with 'ruby trades.rb' and it should work.

Made me giggle a little

I think this is a very plausible theory. It's not even that complicated, just some simple SQL injection. (Pfft, downvoters. I'm referring to the theory on the bottom, not the manually deposit thing)
