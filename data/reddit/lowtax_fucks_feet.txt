Reddit is the 6th most popular website in the US and gets a few hundred million visits a month.  SA had maybe 100k users at peak popularity 15 years ago and now consists of nothing but pants-shitting incels.
There are subreddits devoted to things like sewing that have orders of magnitude more subscribers than Lowtax could ever dream of.
In short, it's a stupid comparison and you should feel bad for making it.

I was wondering when the pants-shitting goonsquad would show up in defense of their lord commander.  
How much of a "gamble" is $10 anyway?  We're talking about forums where mass-bannings would occur simply when Lowtax needed a new car or to pay for a divorce lawyer.  It seems like the real gamble was buying forum membership to begin with.
Bitcoin is simply just another item on the long list of things that goons were wrong about for the sake of comedy.

Also, can we get a special [fuck you]( to Cards Against Humanity for their brilliant forethought in the name of cheap comedy?  Thousands of us were chomping at the bit to throw them piles of coins, but they decided to pick the wrong path.

funny you mention that.  sa used to make fun of google and gmail just as they do bitcoin.  they said gmail was a failure and would never make it.  goons are wonderful prognosticators.

Coinbase needs an IQ and basic literacy test as part of their verification process.

You're an idiot.  This would only make sense if I spent my time wiping up the feces of people who constantly trashed bitcoin.
This whole exercise was to point out that SA was not only wrong about bitcoin, but now also poor because of it.

the goonrush from  and  on synirc should be starting any time now.

witcoins is the guy talking about linux:  
fucking goons.

Aren't you too busy coddling child rapists back on SA to hang out here?  Seriously, your reason for living is burning to the ground as we speak and you still think trolling here is funny.  Go troll SASS since they're a much bigger threat to your precious forums.

remember that time goons tried to buy an island with ISK they made from autismswarm?  
@_date: 2013-10-27 20:10:02
In one of the very first anti-bitcoin threads on SA, you guys made fun of some kid for the way his GPUs were cooled or power supplies were set up, or some such thing.
That kid is now driving a Tesla and has a paid off house with a view.

go back to yospos you fucking autistic.
