Like when I have to convert my dollars into pounds to spend it at the grocery store? 
Oh wait no,  US dollars are actually a functional form of currency, so I never had to ever do that.

Why the fuck would businesses spend any capital if they could gain 1000% by doing nothing and sitting on money?  Why would banks loan you money for a mortgage for a paltry 4%?

Where are you getting that number?

That's the spirit!

Too polite I'd say

That's what my metaphor applies to?  I understand it takes some critical thinking that you may lack

Hahaha really?  The meteoric growth?  Mainstream awareness? Futures? Loss of adopters?

There's no way to determine an investments value?  Somebody better tell that to the financial industry

People who evaluate their investment could tell you it's overvalued. I got out at 7g, no regrets, clear signs it was overheated then. Generally (see always) when this type of market corrects,  it overcorrects. The non-speculative value of BTC is very little. I'd put money in on it dropping to 1-2g in a month,  I'll buy in again sub 3g

Right, with enforcement of said law made possible by.... ?

Yeah 'cept it's hella expensive.

It's not really the same this time considering all the new factors. Who knows where the floor could be? I'm guessing 2k, possibly zero if other coins take off from the floor first

Shit, when I'm not seeing things about the newer generation having way too much stress,  they're the laziest pieces of sit around

Try not paying your taxes and see if it's backed by nothing.

It's artificially high because people are trying to use it? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:59:08
Smart!  Overextend yourself! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:01:17
Lol good luck ��

Wut. No it ain't
