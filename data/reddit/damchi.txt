Being computer-literate is just as important as being plain literate (being able to read and write letters and numbers). I can't see how knowing what a QR code is and knowing how to interact with it would qualify as a "sad state of affairs".
On your second concern: there's plenty of places that take bitcoin as payment - some are listed [here]( Besides, it's not really that important what you can buy with bitcoin today, but what you'll be able to buy with it in the future - if you dismiss bitcoin (or any autonomous cryptocurrency) in advance due to it unable to achieve a certain goal, then you're preventing it from ever achieving that goal at all. 
Oh. Additionally... What can you really buy with gold at the moment, in most places?

I'm actually surprised that his speech has gone largely unnoticed in here.
Some of what he said did sound like they're looking into the possibility of regulating crypto protocols and not just custodial wallets/exhanges. Who knows what will happen once they realize there's no company running bitcoin that can be coerced into tuning the protocol to regulatory demands.

He's saying that not all regulation is bad regulation.
Bad bitcoin regulation would be - 
1. all cryptocurrency wallet providers (any entity, corporate or private) must ensure that their wallets/software/network can only be used by known "customers" who pass the kyc/aml checks.
2. It is not permitted to sell, buy, transmit any crpytocurrency or partake ina any system/network that doesn't follow rule 1.
3. Acting counter 2 is punishable by 5 years in jail.

What good is High-Frequency Trading (HFT) for the "need of the real economy"?

Fas, cheap, centralized/controlled payments have been around for ages in the form of credit cards and paypal. Why use crypto at all to solve this non-existent problem?

This has to be a troll or a parody account, right? You're asking why the creator of an unhackable* system didn't think of some way to prevent shortcomings/dangers of what's **outside** this system. And yes, exchanges are **NOT** a part of bitcoin, nor are they a neccessity. Want some bitcoin? Earn it like you earn money otherwise. Do you *buy* your USD/EUR at an exchange too?
And btw... Why don't jewelry makers think of some way to secure their customers from muggers? The lady with that 5000 EUR necklace walking around town is a perfect target. Also... Shame on Nike! There have been people killed for a pair of Air Jordan's. Why didn't Nike prevent this?!

You can still acquire bitcoin anonymously via in-person or OTC trades. Removing exchanges that do follow AMC/KYL guidelines just screws up the general population's access to cryptocurrencies. In other words, criminals/terrorists can (ab)use cryptocurrencies even if a country "bans" the use crypto, as long as there's a "black market" (and this WILL always exist). Consequently, this means that any government banning crypto has absolutely NOTHING to do with preventing money laundering or financing of terrorism and criminal activites, because such an endeavour is ex ante doomed to fail. This raises the question of what the real goal of banning crypto is - imo it's the same goal as the war on cash (paper money).

It's the other way around imo. Everything will be tracked, blocked on a whim by state and other powerful actors **without** bitcoin (or some other censorship resistant, autonomous cryptocurrency). Paper moneys days are numbered, make no mistake about it; google war on cash (especially in the EU, where it's at least highly impractical of not outright illegal to make any significant purchase in cash). Do you think bank digital money or state "cryptocurrencies" won't track and report every movement of funds + feature a kill-switch of some sort? And it'll all come nicely wrapped in the form of fighting terrorism, pedophiles and drugs, and the general population will bend over while cheering loudly... 
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:30:40
You make a good point. This is why being a "currency" isn't really that important for the value of bitcoin (of course being able to make transfers is important, but paying for coffe and retail purchases won't make or break bitcoin). The censorship resistance, trustless nature, inabilty to counterfeit the "coins" (I'm fully aware there are actually no coins in bitcoin), to double spend... That's what's important about bitcoin. Any xyz coin can act as a payment system and a currency in this meaning, but that won't mean the coin/token/unit will have any value above what is needed for the payment system to be functional. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:00:25
I'm just gonna say this: don't fall for the "inferior tech" some altcoiners are peddling. Bitcoin itself is evolving with time + let's not forget all the stuff that can be / is being built on top - this all ensures that bitcoin is adopting necessary "new tech". And keep in mind that being conservative (=using proven and thoroughly tested stuff) isn't a bad thing when dealing with money.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:03:54
Of course I do, but not if it jeopardises other (more important imo) qualities of bitcoin - being permissionless, censor-resistant and unseizable; all of which ensures being able to use bitcoin freely.

They're one of the biggest (of not the biggest) player in the system, so they could adopt best practices that benefit the system. Especially since it can't be that bloody complicated to implement segwit, seeing how it's already been done by other exchanges, big and small (Bitstamp,...)

Probably 95% is purely speculative. Hopefully 5% of those people read up on the features of bitcoin and see the beauty of it.
Also, keep in mind that Bitcoin still represents a secure (unforgeable, uncrackable, enormous hashing power behind it) and decentralized (censorship resistant) ledger where you can store wealth. Therefore, smaller payments for day to day shopping being unattractive due to fees, don't devalue the utility of bitcoin. It is however doubtful how many newcomers realize this, but I suspect most of them think all the records are kept by a couple of weirdos in an Excell spreadsheet somewhere.

I get your point and I agree that it was a widely used reference in textbooks as well as popular literature. But as it turns out, the actual scope and content of the tulip mania was vastly overestimated and misrepresented.
However, people (even schooled economists, professional bankers, etc) keep babbling about how "the Bitcoin craze" is **exactly like** "the Tulip mania" and *we all know how that ended*, which is preposterous, since they all source their (supposed) knowledge from the literature that's presenting wrong facts.

3. What bitcoin accomplishes is presented in the whitepaper merely as: *"In
this paper, we propose a solution to the double-spending problem using a peer-to-peer distributed
timestamp server to generate computational proof of the chronological order of transactions."*
4. The only mention of a "currency" can be found in this sentence: *"These costs and payment uncertainties
can be avoided in person by using physical currency, but no mechanism exists to make payments
over a communications channel without a trusted party.*. That's not even talking about bitcoin per se.

Of course there will be a blocksize increase eventually. The main reason they were against 2x was that it was rushed. Additionally, segwit IS a blocksize increase and any further blocksize increase before segwit is fully utilized and taken advantage of would mean bad development.

There have been 315K + transactions in the last 24 hours, worth 1,895,846 BTC 
($24,488,026,762 USD). Bitcoin has never been hacked, have user funds stolen or locked up due to underlying's protocol complex features (the omnipotency of ethereum is a curse in a way, bitcoin is simple and conservative, which makes it a fantastic system for transfering monetary value). Bitcoin is the most decentralized and thus censorship proof crypto of them all, because it **doesn't**  have a boss or an entity or multiple entities acting in concern that fully controls all aspects of it (protocol rules, client software, mining software...). 
I'd say bitcoin is doing **what it was designed to do** just fine.
As bitcoin is an opensource project, everyone is able to make a fork. It's up to the users (individual users, exchanges, software developers, miners) to decide which "version" they want to follow. Thay doesn't make bitcoin a *scamshow*. What would you propose? A closed source, proprietary system, run by a company? Yeah... We already have that in credit cards, conventional banks, paypal... Crpytos can't compete with those in offering cheap and fast transfers in conventional and retail transactions (maybe with lightning, but the future will tell).

They currently are  (i.e. Litecoin - same blocksize, 2.5 minute block target = 4x capacity; Bcash = bigger block size). But 1st layer/on-chain scaling is not sustainable and it's not a long-term solution. Rather, on-chain scaling is kicking the can down road. Watch A. Antonopolous explain it here:  and (longer) here: 
And you have it backwards - on-chain scaling eventually leads to centralization -who's going to run a node or mine when you need  need 50TB HD space for the blockchain and a 1 gbps dedicated to receive new TXs/blocks and not produce orphan blocks.

I agree that the current bitcoin situation sucks and that these crazy fees are making bitcoin completely unusable for day to day purchases. I also get that cheap, fast payments, no/minimal fees were the "selling point" of bitcoin in the past and what got a lot of old timers into bitcoin (I mined &amp; used those mined bitcoin to pay for vpn in 2011 already!). 
But bitcoin being just means for a fast and cheap payment, isn't what the true function and value of bitcoin iso (IMO). It's the censorship resistance, the permissionless, the neutrality of the money system bitcoin provides. And **THIS** needs to be preserved at all cost. So measures that might be detrimental to this "neutrality of money" must be avoided, even if they don't cause immediate detriment. And raising blocksize now in order to alleviate the congestion, when there's other measures that can bring the same result (segwit makes txs smaller, thus more can fit in the same blocksize), can (and will) turn out to be detrimental to the neutrality and decentralization of bitcoin.

The mining service and Coinbase should reimburse you if their platform was hacked. If Bitcoin is stolen from your private wallet (real wallet, where you hold your keys) it's on you.
 Noone will "rewind" cash back to your pocket if you get robbed either. I don't hear anyone leaving out at cash because it can get stolen.

The reason why bitcoin is going up in value is that it's currently in the price discovery stages. I expect (and hope) it stabilizes eventually, giving no or minimal yield, similar to gold or a low interest rate bank deposit.

Check how bitstamp handled adding bch to their trading pairs. That was the right way to do it. They announced it a couple of days in advance and prior to making bch tradeable, they allowed people to withdraw bch. Coinbase's way? "We'll allow only withdrawals in January 2018", then boom "Here's full bch support" on December 19th, without a prior announcement of any sort (and no, adding something to their api is not an announcement). And all of this on the same day that BTC difficulty adjusts + there's an influx of high fee txs that clog up the mempool even further?

I never really gave a fuck about how hard it is to break down a gold bar into smaller pieces until i actually wanted to sell a portion of my holding!
I bought 100g of gold a couple of years ago and now I wanted to sell 30g of it in order to buy a really nice leather jacket. 
Fuck me. I tried as hard as i could to chisel away a piece, but just couldn't do it. So I said, screw this and decided to take my 100g bar down to the bullion dealer to exchange it for 7x10g bars and the rest in cash. The wanker wanted to pay me their buying price for 100g and sell me their 7x10g coins @ their buying price, the difference comes out to about 3%. I feel this is some sort of scam.

You sound like some dude i listened to last week, who was claiming bitcoin was "old tech", because there are coins who have faster transfers.
Blockchain tech and 1st layer transacting is "inefficient" by design and no amount of on-chain scaling will fix it + screwing around with block sizes too much (not saying that some block size increase isn't feasible) will affect the decentralization which is the point of bitcoin. Yes, the main feature of bitcoin isn't fast, cheap payments (not on-chain).

What you're talking about isn't the US Dollar as a currency, it's cash. And there is actually a war against cash going on - big denomination bills being taken out, limits to how much a business is allowed to accept in cash from consumers and even less from another business, etc.
If you saw Stiglitz's rambling last week, about having to outlaw BTC, then you probably noticed how he immediately called for "entering the 21st century" and going digital. This digital money that's being pushed onto us will of course assure complete traceabilty (each transaction will have your name and face) and absolute control over it by a central entity (probably a bank, or some paragovernmental institution) that will be able to freeze or forfeit your funds on a whim (state decree, judge's order, soesnt really matter). That's the future that awaits us if autonomous, decentralized cryptocurrencies fail.

From what I understand, the devs believe we should first make use of segwit, which itself  is a 1st layer capacity increase. Then work/analysis on further onchain scaling solutions can begin.
It's understandable that we "normies" just want the coin to work, even if it means doing a hack job, but I've read enough explanations on why they're approaching blocksizs increases very conservatively, that I'm convinced they're making the right decisions.

Because no other blockchain system can provide fast cheap payments by scaling on the 1st layer (blockchain itself) without sacrificing the decentralized character of its network. And this decentralization is where censorship resistance and neutrality of the system stem from. These features are what's meaningful anouy bitcoin and what give it value.
You can achieve fast and cheap payments much easier and with less hassle by employing a centralized system with a trusted intermediary (i. e. Paypal, credit cards).

Well.. Bitfinexed hasn't exactly proven anything either - he's only thrown out allegations and theories of nefarious activity on Tether's (Bitfinex's) side.
To tell you the truth i find it highly unlikely that Tether would be dumb enough to issue billions of USDT after being subpoenaed and investigated by the US LA.
I have my own "conspiracy theory" (suspicion) about USDT though... We dont know who's buying billions of USDT. Cluld it be the conventional financial system trying to induce BTC volatility rather cheaply that way. Western BTC/fiat exchanges cater to private persons and banks (Wall street) are barred from bringing money in that way and trading there. What if "they" are buying tether which they then spread around on non-fiat exchanges (Binance, Hitbtc,...) and pump'n'dump and cause mayhem there?

Blocking transactions is bad, but only an attacker that would basically be willing to bring down the whole bitcoin network would block all transactions for a long period of time and, which would mean he'd sacrifice his own investment in the mining gear as well. Where's the motive for doing that?
And you're definitely wrong on the 2nd point. Noone can "push code changes to the blockchain" (what does that even mean?) by utilizing a majority hashing power attack. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 02:30:03

So the attack would consist of censoring/blocking transactions then (since the other vector of attack is double spending which you've dismissed)? How would the attacker game the market and gain tremendously by betting the market in this situtation - what would he do?
@_date: 2018-10-11 12:04:07
What if you mined to one wallet, then transfered all the amount to a new trezor/ledger walet or mobile wallet and then formatted your old hard drive with the original wallet.dat? Let's not forget bitcoin was worth peanuts 8 years ago (I moned like 5 btc in 2 days with my gfx back then, and used those to buy a month of vpn sub). 
What if you used cryptsy to trade - transfer from wallet A to cryptsy, then afterwards Cryptsy to wallet B? What  if you used Shapeshift to convert and forgot to copy the conversion info (you didn't have to register with Shapeshift in the past and there was no email confirmation or anything).
You SHOULD have some wiggle room for the explanation, but when dealing with authorities, different agencies and courts you sadly usually DON'T. And even if you do actually win at the end instance - like the ECHR, you'll have spent a tremendous amount of time, energy and money. And all because of legislation like this, which basic premise is that you're guilty unless proven otherwise.

If you're not moving your bitcoin, then it doesn't really matter if they're stored in a non-segwit address or a segwit one. But there's no harm in moving all your bitcoin to a segwit adrees either. Just send your stored bitcoin to yourself to a new segwit address.

There's no real evidence of actual "mass euphoria". Sure, the media was full of crypto stories and a lot of people talked about cryptocurrencies, but there's no actual numbers on how many people actually bought any bitcoin (or other coins).
IMO, 2% (if that) of "average Joes" actually bought any cryptoccurrency until now. There's still tremendous room  for growth and adoption, which in turn will lead to price increase as well. Hopefully once we're past this price discovery phase, bitcoin will stabilize and it will become a viable store of value &amp; unit of account (+ LN for mass payments = ideal currency) for the masses.

So basically, use bitcoin as a *savings account* (albeit a better one as it's an unseizable and permissionless) and "cash out" as needed. I don't see a problem with this line of thinking, especially not currently since 2nd layer solutions aren't yet ready for mass adoption.

The value you're talking about doesn't go anywhere, because it's not there to begin with. Market cap is merely multiplication; current price per unit X outstanding units.
And of course bitcoin's price would fall in case of a massive sell off - just the same as any other asset or financial instrument. Imagine 50% of Amazon shareholders selling their stock at once. Price would plummet.

And you're the one ignoring whatever doesn't suit your argument. You stated that abolishing cash isn't that bad of an idea, since cash **allows** money laundering, tax evasion, etc. Well..

Why does it **have** to increase dramatically? It probably **will** because of how lucrative it currently is, which means more and more hash power will enter the mining business. But this will also bring about new development, more efficient miners, which will lower the consumption (DragonMint miner, japanese mining producers). The whole network can certainly function just fine with a fraction of the hashing power (it'll just be less secure).


Yeah, but Bitcoin isn't just "Blockchain technology". It's a system that you can trust completely WITHOUT having to trust anyone individual participant or even a group of individual participants. That has never before been achieved. 


People absolutely need to know more than that. Actually, believing that Bitcoin is just "Blockchain technology" which in itself is nothing more than another database technology that moves data a certain way is complete bullshit and absolutely conceals the true revolutionary achievement that Bitcoin is. Furthermore, it gives legitimacy to the completely bogus premise of "Blockchain, not Bitcoin" that we see popping up all over the world, mostly in corporate and business settings, all with the intention of selling some "disruptive, revolutionary product" built utilizing the "Blockchain technology" (they of course then use this Blockchain technology as just another database, but the investors who know jack shit are still blown away, 'coz it's teh Blockchain).

Regarding Bitcoin being replaced with a "quantum coin" - Don't you think quantum resistance will be implemented into the Bitcoin protocol, once a consensus is reached that this is needed (and methods for quantum resistance get developed)?

1. This isn't a race.
2. This isn't a get rich (quickly) scheme.
I'm perfectly happy with using Bitcoin as a "savings account", as long at the value stays somewhat stable, which i believe will happen as more and more people enter into Bitcoin. This way **I** am the one who decides what happens with my money and I needn't rely on a bank or some other entity, nor do I need to justify and explain the movement of my money or be afraid of having to explain it to someone.
 Any appreciation to the value is just an extra bonus.

Is that a question you're asking? If so, then the answer is that there has been no known occurence of anyone (government or private entity) "hacking" Bitcoin via quantum nor conventional computing. Bitcoin security implications due to quantum computing are mostly theoretical and (AFAIK) years/decades away.

This is a major, IMO the biggest, "feature" of Bitcoin.
 No Bitcoin in a future cashless society = all transactions go through a "permissioned system" that logs everything (and not in a pseudonymous way like Bitcoin). The World **needs** a neutral, permissionless, money/payment system to ensure ongoing liberty of countries and individuals. Bitcoin has the best outlook to be that system, because everything in Bitcoin's governance and ecosystem is set to guarantee the decentralization and thus neutrality, permissionlessness and security of Bitcoin (e.g: relatively slow development and slow adding of new features, small block size - these all serve to ensure that Bitcoin stays Bitcoin).

Regarding Buffet: he showed he doesn't understand Bitcoin when he compared it with cheques. The other famous statement of his is how Bitcoin is "probably rat poison squared", backing his pal Munger. The latter statement isn't really a coherent argument (it's more like a mindless rant, something you'd hear behind the bar in a pub or something), so he can't be correct/right with that statement. 
Regarding Bitcoin as an investment: I actually agree that buying bitcoin shouldn't be seen as a (classic) investment. It's not - you are actually buying an object that isn't an asset that is used to produce anything. That doesn't mean that this object is useless - it is, because of its properties - it can be transfered over large distances (the whole internet)  with ease, is unforgeable, supply can't be inflated, etc. In this extent it shares some characteristics with gold - namely those that make gold suitable as money, i.e. store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account  (and use of gold as money is the main real case use since ancient time). Since bitcoin is useful because of these properties means it has some value. How much worth it is because it has value, is up for the global society to agree. We're still very early in the process of making such an agreement / in the process of price finding. I haven't a clue on how much we'll all eventually agree bitcoin is worth, but I believe we're still very early on, the adoption and usage is still low, which is why i expect the price will be set higher than it currently is (and in fact higher than the last ATH). And this is where people can make long term profits  and thus consider their input an "investment".

Safely storing a larger amount of bitcoin that you only occasionally use = get a hardware wallet. Search youtube for "ledger nano s tutorial" or "trezor bitcoin tutorial" to see how easy it is.
It's perfectly ok to use your phone for smaller amounts. Just send $100 or so to your mobile wallet from your hardware wallet. Use Samourai or Mycellium or even Electrum mobile. To pay for something or send btc to your friend use your mobile wallet's qr code scanner.
Storing and using bitcoin is not too hard for the average Joe, although it does require learning the procedure at first.

I remember Jimmy Song saying something like: the killer app of blockchain has already been found - it's Bitcoin. I agree completely.

How are you going to force 100% Segwit in the current governance model? Centralizing the power to do so to a committee or a group of devs would make bitcoin into a shitcoin with a leader that can be influenced/coerced.
Segwit is needed for lightning and there's no way around that. If you want to use lightning, you can't avoid financing the channel via a segwit transaction. It works. Forcing others to use segwit won't affect your lightning experience.

No one is saying bitcoin is the same as gold. The comparisons between the two are being made because **certain** properties /characteristics are the same. They're both unforgeable (no one can make fake gold or bitcoin and pass it off as real), scarce (it takes a lot of effort to mine gold, so the availability can't be inflated by new supply; new bitcoins are created by mining according to known and perpetual protocol), they both stay the same over time and don't decay. And it's those characteristics of gold and bitcoin that are the foundation of using both of them as money.
Of course gold is a metal and bitcoin is not. But Byt that just means that you can hit someone on the head with gold which is not what dictates the value of gold. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 10:03:48
Gold has been used as a store of value, medium of exchange and unit of account back when people thought the Earth was flat and they'd consider electronics witchcraft. Pretty much the only other than monetary use was jewelry. Both of these uses stem from the fact that gold doesn't corrode and go bad with time. Just as gold stays gold, bitcoin stays bitcoin.

The price lingered between $200 and $300 from January to November 2015, then suddenly jumped to \~ $400. Then it lingered AGAIN between $400 and $500 until end of May 2016 when it jumped to \~ $700, then fell to $600 and then  lingered YET AGAIN between $600-700 until January 2017 when it jumped to $1000+.

Someone who only gets in to get out at a certain (higher) price point is nothing more than a speculator. If that were all this whole thing was, then it would be justified to call it a pyramid scheme. But that's not what bitcoin is about.

The main similarities between gold and bitcoin are the durability (gold doesn't decay over time, bitcoin doesn't change over time either), scarcity (the amount of gold currently available on the planet is roughly known and you can only extract a limited amount of new gold from the ground + extraction is costly; bitcoin has a known and set rate of issuance and "mining" it is costly), unforgeability (gold and bitcoin become available to us by exactly one method each - gold from refining gold ore, bitcoin by mining. Neither can be created by any other method or otherwise falsified).

Gold has been used as a store of value and medium of exchange for thousands of years, LONG before any electronics were available. So no, gold isn't valuable because of its use in electronics; it's valuable because it's gold, it's rare and it can't be forged. The latter characteristics are why bitcoin is sometimes compared to gold. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 16:38:40
Bitcoin ≠ Bitcoin exchanges. 
The exchanges (on/off ramps) should be regulated as those are not covered by the Bitcoin protocol. Any attempt of governments to interfere with the protocol itself is a big no-no.

No, I don't agree with you and that's not the conclusion I'd make from those 2 links i gave you. I suggest you re-read the 2nd article, from the part titled "Bitcoin’s use value" on.
*Intrinsic value* is mainly a philosophical question and it's highly doubtful such a thing exists at all, nor is there consensus has when a thing has value “in itself,” or “for its own sake,” or “as such,” or “in its own right.”. Your example with the rocket shows that intrinsic value is highly subjective and subject to consensus as well. A rocket can take you to space, yes. But that doesn't mean much if no one is interested in going to space or transporting something there. Would a rocket have "intrinsic value" in the stone age? Probably not, because a  caveman would have no idea what to do with it... This brings us to usefulness - we usually assign "intrinsic value" to an object, an asset, a thing, that has a use. And that what the article on fee. org article refers to, the use case of bitcoin. 
I'd like to recommend another article, which I find pictures the essence of Bitcoin much better than any of those *Bitcoin is a new type of currency, a virtual currency* "explanations".

Centralized systems built around Bitcoin (mostly on/off ramps, i.e. exchanges) will inevitably be subjected to regulation. What's important and what makes or breaks Bitcoin (actually any cryptocurrency) IMO is that the protocol itself can't be touched by state regulation and remains neutral and open - meaning noone can effectively freeze or seize someone's bitcoin without the cooperation of the owner.

Posts like yours (or of such flavour) keep popping up on this subreddit. Quite frankly, I'm amazed at how ignorant people are of how price is formed on exchanges. Assets, stock, any other instruments  that are traded on exchanges can never be "cashed out" by all their current holders at once. Do you think that every AMZN holder can sell their stock right now and get \~ 1600 USD per stock? Or imagine if suddenly everyone who owns gold decided to sell it.. The price would plummet to the lowest open buy order at the exchange.

Just to make it clear: The bank doesn't sell bitcoin, they're selling vouchers from another issuer (Bitins), which you can then "cash in" for bitcoin via their (Bitins') site. The exchange rate is kinda shitty + there's a 7% provision in top.
I'm not saying this isn't a step towards mainstream acceptance and legitimization of bitcoin in the eyes of the genereal public, but it's certainly not a "to the moon" occurence.
Another thing.... We've been able to buy these same coupons/vouchers at every gas station in Slovenia for over a year. AFAIK, you can get bitcoin vouchers at every post office in Austria as well. Again, I'm not shitting on this atm thingy, but i just don't see it as a major development.

AFAIK Robinhood doesn't have any bitcoin, so enabling bitcoin withdrawals isn't simply a feature  they could add to their app. They first need to start buying actual bitcoin in order to let people withdraw that bitcoin.

Once you have a wallet (software) installed on your system, its developer can't block you from using it. So you can use that software for as long as you wish. 
In case your installed wallet stops working (e.g. because the bitcoin protocol has been updated and your installed wallet is no longer able to interact with the bitcoin blockchain), or starts working "funny" after an update (e.g. only allowing you to send to certain addresses,...), then you can import your *seed* (which you HAVE to keep for backup anyway) into another wallet, which restores your access to your bitcoin.
As you see, you're not subject to any control from the wallet software developer/owner.
Just to make an obvious remark: a Coinbase, Bitstamp, Kraken or any other exhange account is NOT a bitcoin wallet.


Yes. Give him your wallet's seed. But beware that this gives him access to all the bitcoin from that wallet, not just what you intended or agreed upon.

The post title refers to "taking over Bitcoin", but your post talks about taking over mining pools. These are two completely different things. 
Miners have an important role in the system, but they don't control Bitcoin. So even if someone - like the Chinese gov. (or any other world gov. for that mater) - were to take over the miners, they wouldn't take over Bitcoin.

Well, bitcoin is different than other things that can be traded. Whether these different properties make it "better" than other things is subjective.
whalecheetah pointed out how Bitcoin can't be  counterfeited and how it's easier to move it around in comparison to gold. I'd add that it's much easier divisible than gold as well, which makes it much more suitable to be used as a medium of exchange than gold.
In comparison to money? 
If you're talking about digital money (what we "have" in our bank accounts), then imo  bitcoin is more secure than that money, since it's not under the control of a 3rd party (the bank) or its whims or outside orders (asset freezes for whatever reason). You're responsible for your own bitcoin and you can do whatever you want with it - meaning transfer it to whomever you want and in any amount you want, without having to give any justification or explanation for it.  In this regard, bitcoin has a lot in common with cash (bank notes and coins), which you can do with as you please as well (but it can't be counterfeited, unlike cash). 
However, there's been "a war against cash" going on all over the World for quite some time and i'm afraid we'll soon be living in a cashless society. When this happens, every transaction will have to be done within "the permissioned system", which brings along financial surveillance, diminishing our liberty. And this is (IMO) the main reason why bitcoin needs to (and will) succeed, because it enables us to transact freely within a permissionless system and this guarantees that the whole world won't turn into a totalitarian place in the long-term.

Much more likely that other players from the conventional financial sector are crashing the market in order to drive people away from Bitcoin. You know: "Oh, it's so volatile.", "People lost their houses and savings by investing in this nothing", "Currency? LOL, how can it be a currency if it goes up and down daily?", "Ponzi! Only the coy early holders got rich. And some of them got their Bitcoin from selling DRUGS!"

A lot of people in Europe are unaware of this and they think "the government" somehow guarantees for their deposits in full up to 100K EUR. In reality, these deposit guarantee schemes' target coverage is .8% (yes, less than one percent) of all protected deposits across the EU (there might be a couple exceptions where it's higher or the country itself actually guarantees). The guarantee schemes are useless in case of systemic failure.

Another coin on another blockchain is just that - another coin, but **not** bitcoin. Why is that other coin incomparable and inferior to bitcoin? For starters, the security (hash rate;see current vertcoin problems with attacks). Then governance system - no CEO, boss, team leader in bitcoin.

Slow and expensive; for small purchases, yes, the onchain TXs are unfeaaible. 2nd layer solutions are here and functional though. If you use and android phone, go download "Bitcoin lightning wallet" and check it out.
Not worth mining either; bitcoin mining difficulty adjusts according to the number of miners mining (hash rate), so the network will happily keep on keeping on even at lower price

You can't have automated recurring payments with bitcoin, because it's a push not pull payment mechanism.

It's not that YOUR bank WILL go bankrupt. It's that a bank might go bankrupt or even worse, many banks at once need bailing -out or -in. With the current financial system and "war" on cash you're basically being forced to credit banks and save them to your and other individuals' detriment. Bitcoin gives you the option to say no to this system by taking your wealth and putting it into something else (something that can easily function as a medium of exchange, which other assets can't).

These are the basically the same argument and show a complete misunderstanding of the bitcoin givernance model. These objections are true of practically all the other (centralized) coins and are the main reason why Bitcoin has an intrinsic advantage towards other coins, which will never be able to catch up/replace bitcoin. Another thing - a miner cannot "erase your ownership" even if he controls 100% of the hashing power.


Bitcoin network/protocol has never been hacked. Hacks happened to systems outside of the network/protocol (exchanges). Is the dollar or euro "hacked" if there's a bank heist?


Bitcoin won't take over cash, the world governments will take away cash. Bans of payment over certain amount in Europe and other places; making using/getting to cash inconvenient (ever had to fill out a questionaire on where the funds came from, explain your business/employment, have your id scanned, when you wanted to  withdraw yournown money that you had "stored" at the bank for a couple of years? No? Then come to the EU) are just the first step. And don't think we will be able to prevent it - it'll happen with overwhelming approval by the public, because hey... You're not for financing terrorism, CP, facilitating money laundering and tax evasion, are you?
So no.. Bitcoin won't replace cash. It will be a replacement for cash that gets taken away from us. And this is (IMO) the main reason Bitcoin needs to succeed - to save us from living in a world of complete (financial) supervision and control.
@_date: 2018-12-07 11:54:55
In order to get any price stability, there needs to be more bitcoin market participants. More participants in a market with finite supply will push the price up (over the long term). So the market cap has to get higher by a multitude of what it is today. Besides... Bitcoin as digital gold for the whole world to have 60 bil market cap? That's less than some ultra rich individuals worth today. Laughable imo
