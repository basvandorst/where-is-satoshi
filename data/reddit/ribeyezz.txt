Ideally all of it would be done using Core, but I like the fact that Electrum supports HD wallets with mnemonics. According to the  twitter, the next release will include PSBT support :) so you could transfer across PSBTs via QR codes.

Why of course ��

Chris, what are your thoughts on an airgapped electrum multisig setup? Do you feel there are any security holes to be wary of with this?

This is the reference implementation of BIP39 as defined in the bip: 
It may be useful for what you want to do.

Not sure if all of the functionality is currently supported in Bitcoin Core, but descriptors should be useful:

You can mix the $10k in \~ 7 batches of 0.1 BTC through Wasabi wallet, and that will effectively obfuscate the history of the coins.

Apparently individually helping people set up their full node...

It doesn't make sense. This is a common misconception.

The answer you probably don’t want to hear is that you have to look at the code and verify for yourself. Using bitcoin securely is about trust minimization. Since you need to run SOME wallet software to interact with the protocol, how can you minimize the risk that you’re running malicious code.
One method of minimizing this risk is using several compatible multisignature wallets. In the event that M-1 are not malicious, you maintain full control of your bitcoin because multisig security is additive. With the advent of PSBT, solutions for this should become more available than they (unfortunately) are now.
Another method is to use Bitcoin Core as your wallet. Core has the most developer eyes watching/reviewing it, so it’s definitely the single wallet that’s most likely correct. For a single signature solution, I would be much more confident in Bitcoin Core than Ian’s tool, though both may be correct. You might also want to look into Electrum. The Glacier Protocol is generally regarded to be the most secure means of using bitcoin; however, it is a very involved process.

By M-1, I meant if you have an M of N multisignature wallet, your bitcoins can’t be compromised unless a quorum (M) of the keys are compromised in some way.

I’m sorry this is a bad argument. Someone making $1-$10 probably isn’t capable of running their own full node for any chain, so this isn’t a relevant concern. In time, the global poor will be onboarded but big blockers hurt far more than they help.
