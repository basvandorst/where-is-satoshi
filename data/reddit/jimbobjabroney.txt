I think OP is trying to figure out the reasons for WHY it's not adopted by the masses. This is like answering the question, "What don't you like about Nickelback" with, "Their music sucks and I hate them." Not very constructive.
How about something more like, "It's confusing for the average user who, realistically, will never invest much time or energy into figuring out how it works. Users want something simple, intuitive, easy to use and secure. Bitcoin is an amazing and revolutionary concept, but for it to take off someone needs to come up with a way to make it simple, I'm talking idiot simple. Like, set up your account in 2 easy steps, push this button to buy bitcoin, push this button to send/receive bitcoin, push this button to print your secret recovery passwords. Or better yet, some way to conduct transactions without even opening an app, which can be slow and cumbersome when compared to the ease of swiping a credit card. Fuck it, just figure out a way to get bitcoin integrated with existing POS machines and we're golden."
PS I say this because I am exactly the type of person that wants to use bitcoin but I'm too stupid and lazy to learn all about it. Instead of telling me I'm wrong for having this attitude, you should be realistic about the fact that I represent the majority and you need to appease me if you want widespread adoption.

What country do you live in? Have you ever tried sending money to another individual through your bank? Wire transfer? Takes time, costs money. Paper checks? Give me a break. Online bill pay? Your bank literally prints out a paper check and puts it in the mail for you. Bitcoin would be so much easier, faster and cheaper than every single one of these options.
