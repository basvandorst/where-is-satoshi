But would dead you really care?

Do you think stable = cheap?  
The two aren't necessarily linked.

Sorry, was focused on the leap from current value to lon-term, future value.  
There is no way to even guess what the future holds for BTC.  Impossible. 
@_date: 2014-02-16 03:36:57
There is no meaningful conversation about long term real value of BTC.  
There is only conjecture tainted with varying levels of subjectivity.  
I hope you don't think I'm being unduly short. But that's the poop on the future of bitcoin.  
No one, but no one, has any real reason to believe they know.  
There is only 'I wish' and 'what if?'

I just tried the Western Union fee estimator for a $1,000 transfer from and to the U.S. The answer?  
That's 6 points by my calculation. 6x coinbase's fee.

How well does print convey a Mainer's accent in Australia?  
And 'Wizard of Id' is still circulating?

Ok, but are you talking about a bill that acts as a paper wallet? How would Customs know how much it's really worth? Because, again, the government (maybe not ALL, but surely most), heavily regulates how much cash you can bring into a country undeclared. Unless, of course, you want to declare how much btc you have at your disposal. I wouldn't.

I'm pretty uninformed when it comes to bitcoin. Maybe that's why your question is hurting my brain.  
Are you saying the bill would have the private key on it?  
Because without it, the bill is worthless.  
With it, the bill is worthless for anyone who likes the security and anonymity of bitcoin (which is most bitcoin owners, I'd imagine).  
How do you see transactions working? I have a bitcoin bill to exchange with someone for goods and services, and the other party just trusts there's bitcoin there? Or do I give the private key and wait for verification? And then what's stopping me from clearing bitcoin off the bill before the vendor?  
I'm unclear about what's happening here.

In the United States, you run into the problem of looking like you're printing or coining your own currency.  
Strictly verboten, in the eyes of the government.  
IIRC, this is why the maker of Casascius stopped pre-loaded btc on his coins.

Where?  
(hoping I didn't just "woosh" myself)

Haha!  
Watching live testimony on C-SPAN is fake news.  
What a time to be alive!

Why'd you take the long trip back all the way to Ollie North?  
You passed Jeff Sessions decades before that.

If I'm not mistaken, the banks exist to make money off of our money. You keep your money safeguarded with them. They use the capital to fund or underwrite other projects.  
You think it's not absurd that a bank would threaten to drop a customer for partaking in legal practices? And we're not talking loans here. And the letter in question references no broken rules or policies. No reason is given.   
Maybe we simply define 'ludicrous' differently.
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:25:51
Forgetting bitcoin for a second.  
How ludicrous does it seem that a bank could threaten to shut you down for legal transactions?  
Vote with your wallets, people.  
That's the only way this stops.
