Have you considered solar powered renewable energy sources whilst running the node?

I'm comfortable with Java (Spring, Android), but have tinkered with a lot of languages (C Python, Swift), so I wouldn't put language as a priority for the moment. To be honest, moving away from Java would be a break for me. 
Let's just say my religious practice is to create new things...Ideally I'd like to start from scratch, but if there is an opportunity for me to join an open source group, I'd hope they'd be willing to answer some questions I may have on their codebase I guess... Please point away to as many as possible!!! ��

Can you explain the significance of having a Linux kernel in this context? A Linux OS wallet? I guess you mean an offline wallet generator? I think your video was nice in the way that you explained the wallet/public key in an accessible manner, it helps technophobes tune in. Disruptive technologies need accessible language when introduced to prospect users.
If you've been coding it, please pass the github �� I hope you can explain the use cases for me so I understand you fully.
Example :
1. User generates wallet with private and public key on phone
2. User has Bitcoin, transfers BTC to offline wallet
3. User has wallet stored in SD card and pulls it out
Is that correct?

Making my own Cryptocurrency sounds fun, but I would have that as a Plan B because I'd seek a project in Bitcoin &amp; Ethereum, and would like to contribute to their success in any increment. Complexity is there, but I do have a good theoretical understanding of Bitcoin's technical engineering, but I believe practical experience is the best way forward!
Predicting prices and Auto-trading, could you please elaborate? even links would be nice ��

I agree, they should at least use one BTC each year if feasible,  but however many lives they can, they should spend on, NOW.
