I dont follow bitcoin very much, but all I ever hear is either people who know too much about bitcoin arguing about it and saying its doomed, and reports about how the value of bitcoin is just keeps going up forever. Whats going on?

I'm surprised that no one has done this yet. Like why not, it's not like it would cost them much to do it and there's all sorts of tricksy things a government could do with their own digital currency.

I hope this sub doesn't become another crap hole like . It's all in good fun I'm sure, but shitposting is literally cancer.
@_date: 2017-01-26 15:06:43
Despite the success of the current administration, shitposting is not a good thing.

I tried to pay my friend with some Bitcoin, but it was too much of a hassle so we just PayPal it.

Oops, I meant to sell before that happened. Oh well, to the moon I guess.
@_date: 2017-01-14 02:40:00
Well everything else is shitty and horrible. I guess we can make Bitcoin even worse too.

Some people don't think it's funny to denigrate people, but you are probably too stupid to know what that word means.

Sorry, it's a joke I stole from Bob Newhartt about country music.

So in theory a credit card transaction would be visible to the credit card company and the government, while a bitcoin transaction would be visible to the credit card company, the government, and anyone else who cares to look?

Shouldnt you buy bitcoin now because you want to use it for buying something?
@_date: 2016-10-28 18:03:20
I thought that part of bitcoin is that everyone can see every transaction that ever happens. How does that offer greater privacy than cash? Edit: I guess that's a little specific. I think what I actually mean is do people want to replace cash and credit with bitcoin?

I had an idea that people who want to support specific candidates but also want to promote bitcoin should create a bitcoin "super fund" where all those people donate bitcoin to their chosen politician, where it will be held until it gets big enough that the politician would would be tempted into accepting and using bitcoin. The actual logistics of such a fund would probably be kind of complicated, but still, money talks.

Goal? Isnt that the point? Whats the goal to have cash money?
@_date: 2016-10-28 18:46:21
That's interesting. Bitcoin really does seem better that way. I wouldn't mind some of the fraud protections that credit cards provide though.

Smalt? Is this real?

This is a medium quality comment. It adds something, but the same could have been done with an down vote.
