Ethos wallet is super secure. Their customer support is top notch. I always see downvotes when I suggest them, but people never comment in why they downvote. I've never had a problem with that wallet.
Edit: spelling error
@_date: 2019-11-01 15:07:24
Ethos wallet is really secure.  Check out Voyager for buying on iOS.

It's just slowing the inevitable. Which is currency erosion. It's a controlled demolition of fiat.

It's great to imagine things, but putting it into reality is the reward.

I'll be using Voyager. They are way better than coinbase.
@_date: 2019-08-26 21:50:01
Each Bitcoin can be divided into 100 million Satoshies.

Lurker for 4 years and decides to start posting a month ago. What gives?
@_date: 2019-08-24 01:53:11
Remember. BTC was born out of the great recession as an answer to corrupt banksters.

Voyager app is where it's at. Said goodbye to coinbase a long time ago and never looked back.
@_date: 2019-08-17 18:20:02
I use Ethos wallet. It supports other chains as well.
@_date: 2019-08-17 17:49:51

Ethos. Best hands down.
@_date: 2019-08-17 19:38:37
Yeah. It's too bad that they ate calling to move it into USD.
@_date: 2019-10-15 03:46:09
Ok thanks for the info. So let's just say for example. That I've been buying and trading bitcorns for the past year. Is this post traceable?
@_date: 2019-10-26 21:54:13
Check out Voyager as well.
@_date: 2019-08-31 22:45:15
That exactly nails it.
@_date: 2019-08-31 21:04:57
Just Google negative interest rates. It's already begun.
@_date: 2019-10-30 14:10:56
Voyager is a crypto broker. They have access to 12 different exchanges. Best price execution and 0 commission trading.
@_date: 2019-08-23 15:58:06
Which subreddit is that? Oh r/BTC. They even have to hide behind the wrong ticker to confuse people.
@_date: 2019-08-24 01:51:14
Looks like all the banks are FOMOing in. Graph is going parabolic. Lol. Is now a good time to buy?
@_date: 2019-10-27 04:25:35
I'm not an expert on these things. But maybe it could be passed on to mine a different chain? Or if it's just useless, then a great artist should come up with a use for them.im not that knowledgable,  but it seems like something could be mineable/artful.
@_date: 2019-08-18 02:34:11
The last bitcoin won't be mined for 130 years.

True it was paid back. But the fact that it happened, indicates a faltering bank in a healthy economy which the fed felt the need to prop up. Something ain't right here. It's as fucked up as you might think.

Everybody's situation is different. Sometimes people need cash at that moment and dont have any other choice.

Yet you would gladly put your money in a system where money can be made from thin air. Where the free market has been so corrupted that public companies can buy back their own shares with that money to give the appearance  that the inflated stock market is still alive. Hard money is coming soon and I have a gut feeling the US is not ready for it.

It's that little rollercoaster guy. He's either going up or down! Such a great meme.

I can only speak of one wallet that I know of and that is Ethos.
@_date: 2019-12-15 02:42:02
I had a small issue with them in 2017. I was suprised when they responded to my ticket and unlocked my funds. It took a week, but other than that I feel lucky.

To everyone who is new/doesn't understand. This is the annual day that we withdraw our bitcoin into OUR OWN wallet. Something that we should be doing in the first place. This puts pressure on exchanges to prove that they are not trading fractional reserves. Bitcoin is hard money. It should all be accounted for.
@_date: 2019-12-15 01:36:51

Android will be released by end of September. But can confirm. Voyager is the way to go.
@_date: 2019-09-20 15:39:51
Well that's disturbing. But the lower the prices go, the more people will be buying. You cant keep a balloon underwater. Eventually the supply will be short.

Check out Voyager. Absolutely the best alternative to Conbase.
@_date: 2019-09-01 01:59:25
Lol. I posted this same question last month and got downvoted and told to lay off the kool-aid. I guess the real answer is we are so desperate for something, anything,different from the current and corrupt banksters, that many are willing to take the risk that Bitcoin was created in good faith.
@_date: 2019-09-10 03:43:19
You just gave me an idea for a sweet bumper sticker.  It's one of those families. The dad is a Bitcoin. Mom is the Ethereum. And then all the baby alts I hold.

Shut up old man! You don't know nuttin!

I remember reading somewhere that there is a company burning BTC using the Satoshi wallet. Could be them.

Nah. Chinese new year and wall street bonuses happen right around January/February. Although I don't think wall street is going for BTC this time. They are going to buy up alts before their buddies the big corporations come into the scene. Also the New Year is cause for price stagnation.  /s
@_date: 2019-09-01 01:27:19
Kind of like Tether. Print Tether, buy Bitcoin, drop the price and repeat.
