The UASF code did not do anything in and of itself. Miners started signalling for SegWit. Whether or not you agree with big blocks/SegWit2x/NYA/whatever, those are the facts.
Now, as for my opinion, it was the NYA that pushed SegWit signalling over the threshold.

@_date: 2018-05-28 11:32:21
I don't like any of your options so I'll just explain my thoughts. 
I strongly believe that a larger base block size should have come before SegWit. The network was saturated, fees were sky high, and people were leaving Bitcoin. It doesn't really matter if most of the transactions were spam or not. Half (maybe less, maybe more) really wanted a block size increase. Doing so might have kept the community together and prevented the bcash hardfork. Kicking the can down the road would have actually helped, despite the negative connotation that comes with the phrase.
Having said that...SegWit is great and I am enjoying the reduced fees. I am running a c-lightning node and testing some things out. Lightning is very cool and I will definitely use it. I am also looking forward to the next phase of development on the root layer, with MAST, Schnorr sigs, etc.
I guess if I have to pick from the above, my outlook now is "Promising". It could have been "Fantastic" though.
@_date: 2018-05-31 18:32:21
That only looks like evidence if you're already convinced they are using AsicBoost.


I don't follow. Why was the cost increased? 
Edit: Anyway that doesnt even really matter. My point was hardfork before segwit would have benefited the network. Segwit wasn't ready until April 2016. Bigger block discussion started in 2014.

There is no OpenSSL process, but it does have its own memory allocation. I think there are two scenarios that are possible: 1. secrets are leaked from the host process or 2. secrets are leaked from openssl. It depends on how the memory is allocated, and by who.. but I'm getting out of my depths at this point.
@_date: 2014-04-10 11:01:56
No, that's incorrect. The bug lies in the TLS heartbeat functionality. An attacker sends a heartbeat to the server and says here is a 64K message, send it back. OpenSSL creates a pointer to the 64K in memory, but then the attacker only sends 1K of data. So finally the server sends back the 64K, comprised of the attackers data plus whatever was sitting in those other 63K of memory. If you keep replaying the attack, you can force the server to keep spitting out chunks of memory until you find something good.

Remember when you said...


Now, if you didn't mean "...we get a 4x on-chain increase with SegWit" like I suggested, and you helpfully quoted, what did you mean?
This isn't splitting hairs. You clearly said SegWit provides something that it does not. I have no problem with you promoting SegWit. Frankly, I really haven't decided if I'm for or against it, yet. I have a problem with you promoting it using lies.


I can't recall you and I ever interacting directly before, and I don't think I've ever mentioned you in a comment, so I'm unsure where you got that idea. Maybe you're trying to convince yourself that you're not a baddie. I'll leave that to you to figure out.

That is a very important distinction that isn't mentioned enough.
@_date: 2017-02-28 19:40:58
A couple comments in no particular order:
- I agree that Emergent Consensus is not a good idea. 
- I think this fee market is bad for bitcoin
- I think you're misinterpreting Gavin's comment about the multiple implementations. 
- You talk about Rogers business in relation to BU, but not Blockstream in relation to Core. Both businesses are trying to mold bitcoin into something that suits their needs.
- The SegWit adoption page is misleading. A wallet that is ready for segwit does not necessarily mean that they think its a good idea, or want it to be activated. If segwit is activated and they don't support it, no one will use their wallet; its business.
- Similarly, the segwit supporting node count does not necessarily equate to support of segwit. Users could be updating for the bug fixes and other improvements, they could be updating only because its a new version. Many probably don't know that they're supporting SegWit by updating. More on this later...
You say:


So hard forks are bad. But.. we can "eventually" expand after we optimize. So hard forks are OK. Which is it?
- You compare an ETH fork to a BTC fork. The former was a fork that re-appriopriated coins. The latter would be a fork aimed at increased throughput. The latter is much less likely to be contentious in any meaningful way.
There is a lie on your "Lies about segwit" list
 &gt; Segwit isn’t a real increase and will take ages to take advantage off. Wrong, all wallets are ready and as soon as it’s activated it will be a big increase (~2.1MB throughput)
There is no evidence that there will be a throughput increase immediately after activation. You're pretending that support = usage, which is untrue. My guess is that after segwit is activated, most transactions will remain non-segwit for sometime. We can *only* guess.
- I like the idea of UASF... mostly. One CPU, one vote, right?
When a user installs the bitcoin client, they should be asked:
- "Do you support BIP 141? Y/N/Dont Care." 
- "Do you support BIP 102? Y/N/Don't Care"
Don't Care could be counted toward Yes or No as long it was consistent. 
Updating the client should not count as proposal support on its own.
Edit: I chose those BIPs just to illustrate my idea. They could be replaced with any BIP that requires signaling.

I think you're using "MB" where you just want an "x", but that is beside the point.
I can accept 2.3x as a theoretical max if we are talking about 100% adoption and every transaction is 2-of-3 multisig.
**There is no scenario where we get a 4x on-chain increase with SegWit.** I'm disagreeing because I believe you are being purposefully deceitful.

When the block reward runs out, please find my grave and let me know.


I doubt you have sources to back that up. Anyway, I didn't say that "no developers like segwit."


Yet there is no upgrade path that doesn't include SegWit. If you upgrade to any Core release post 0.13.0, your node supports SegWit.
As an aside, do you read the release notes for every package that you `apt-get upgrade`? I didn't think so.


Dr. Seuss would post from his real account.


Do we, all of a sudden, not care what users want? I thought that was the whole idea behind taking control of the protocol away from miners.
Anyway, no, I'm not saying they need to code a competing fork for every proposal. I'm saying that we should level the playing field. I like SegWit and think it should be activated. I like a hard fork to bigger blocks too. I can show node support for SegWit by upgrading the Core client. I can only show my support for a HF by running a competing node implementation (BU or Classic.)
The narrative is that:
"Every node 0.13.1 or greater *wants* SegWit. There are lots of them, so the majority of the community wants SegWit!"
"We can't do a HF because we don't have consensus."
The difference for the second part is that we have no way of showing support for it.
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:45:50
Your first four points are valid criticisms and should be addressed immediately. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:48:37
The problem is that I am being told by Luke that there is not consensus, when he knows full well that there is no way to even vote with Core. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 20:31:06
Saying SegWit is a scaling improvement but not a solution is not a contradiction.
Edit: no, a HF to 1.2 MB is not a solution either.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:26:00
Never. If SegWit doesn't get support before the signaling window ends, then they can try again. That was always the plan.
This is probably more dangerous than a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-03-01 18:17:39
Neither SegWit or UASF are scaling features.
There will be a transaction throughput increase in SegWit when it is activated and used, but that is a byproduct. 
UASF is about signalling for soft-fork support, so not a scaling feature at all.
Edit: I should have said solution instead of feature to be more clear, oh well.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:08:07
By the same logic, UASF will be rejected, right?
There is widespread, and strong opposition to it.
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:20:05
If non-mining nodes are able to signal for a SegWit soft fork, they should also be able to signal for a HF to bigger blocks.

@_date: 2017-03-17 16:58:37
Check out my analysis from this thread: 
Edit: I'll just repeat it here:
There was consensus for a HF, then shit happened, now there isn't. Apparently. 
At the bitcoin roundtable it was agreed that (among other things) miners would run a SegWit release in production **by the time a hard-fork blocksize increase was released in a version of Core.**
The agreement was supported by five(!) prominent Core developers. The community seemed to be in agreement about the HF, except for Greg, who lashed out after the fact.
When it was clear that Core would not be integrating HF code, miners retaliated by running other node implementations and calling for a HF without SegWit. At this point, all of a sudden, a HF became contentious.
As an aside, Greg said on the core roadmap that a HF after SegWit would increase its efficiency, and gave the impression that he was on board with such a thing. Emphasis mine.

... he says, knowing full well that **there is no way to measure community support.**
@_date: 2017-03-24 12:34:19
Do you mean 0.13.1+, which supports SegWit? 
I'm not talking about SegWit. I am talking about a bigger max base size, as defined by BIP 141:


@_date: 2017-03-06 23:17:34
SegWit readiness is not necessarily an indication of support.
Wallets, libraries and exchanges are following the core roadmap because core is currently the majority of nodes. If SegWit is activated and they aren't ready, people won't use their service. 
I want SegWit to be activated, but let's not lie to get it done.
@_date: 2017-03-19 21:40:37
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:13:38
So if there were a bounty for coding a feature where non-mining nodes could signal for a HF to bigger blocks with Core, would you be interested?
I think we desperately need bigger blocks. Currently, the only way for me to express that is to run BU or Classic, but I don't like emergent consensus.
Possibly something like I described in the other sub:


I am imaging an installation or first run screen that says "Do you wish to configure support flags?"








I think that makes way more sense than just assuming an up-to-date node supports any soft-fork currently in the signalling period.

in the Elements Alpha sidechain; the soft-fork segwit now proposed
is a second-generation design. And I think it's quite reasonable to
get this deployed in a relatively short time frame. **The segwit design
calls for a future bitcoinj compatible hardfork to further increase its
efficiency**--but it's not necessary to reap most of the benefits,and that
means it can happen on its own schedule and in a non-contentious manner.
@_date: 2017-03-10 12:57:52
Well written.
**Le'ts get SegWit activated** and then start working on a HF, **as per the original intentions**. At that time we can include an increase to base block size. SegWit already allows for up to 4MB blocks (1MB base + 3MB witness), so 4MB blocks (2MB base + 2MB witness) should be ultimately no change for nodes in terms of bandwidth or storage.
Actually, I'd guess that seeing a pull request or even a BIP for such a thing would change the minds of the anti-segwit miners.

Until miners are able to signal for this proposal, you have no way of knowing if it will reach a super majority or not, and thus your claim of 2 or 3 coins is just fearmongering.

I agree, but not at 4MB. This is proven by the fact that with SegWit, you can have 4MB blocks. Everyone seems to be OK with that.
In another thread I asked why we couldn't have a 2MB base + 2MB for witness, instead of 1MB+3MB. I didn't get any response.

Edit: I see this post is getting lots of love. I wasn't talking about the fee estimation functionality change. I was talking about the good old days when I could use the default fee of 0.0001 BTC/kb and I would have 6 confirms in an hour. Now we need to use a fee estimator so that we can hope for 1 confirm in an hour.

My post is in reference to implementing bigger blocks in Core, via a hard-fork.

Someone should ask for his thoughts on the fee market and its relationship to block size.

So.. SegWit plus a blocksize increase? Sounds like what everyone agreed to in HK. Funny how that works.
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:09:33
Please explain to me how transactions make it from the mempool into the blockchain and how new coins are released onto the network without mentioning miners or mining.

Can you link me to where I said BU has more support than Core?
I've never said it, and there is no way that my initial comment reads like that.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:22:33
I don't really get that impression, and thats kind of the point of my post. 
The story is skewed depending on where you read it, but I think there is a lot of "Core is evil" alongside the "BU is incompetent." 
I think this will spur BU supporters to scour the Core code base for bugs. Who knows if they will find any, but its clear this is bad for bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-07 15:35:15
But it's not *really*.
In another thread, said...




So, you either upgrade your node, or you put an upgraded node in front of your node. How is that different than upgrading your node for a HF?

But I don't support BU, I support Core. Do you see the problem yet?
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:50:44


They can integrate code and then leave it up to nodes and miners to activate it, just like BIP9 soft-forks. 


It was, or was very close. The HK agreement was made in good faith by many parties.

Disclaimer: I want SegWit, I want more than a 1.7x effective block size increase, I do not like emergent consensus.
I am 100% on board about asking them. While we are at it, lets also ask if they want to HF to bigger blocks, OK? 
As I've mentioned repeatedly, the fact that a wallet, library, or exchange is SegWit ready does not necessarily mean that they think its a good idea. Since Core is the current majority, it is in the best interest of bitcoin developers to follow their road map. In a situation where SegWit is activated and they are not ready, no one will use their software. Its a business decision, not a technical one.
@_date: 2016-03-18 01:41:20
Are you talking about the choice between mining Core or Classic? It almost sounds like you're saying that miners can't choose which client to run. That can't be what you mean...right?
@_date: 2017-02-13 21:05:42
Yea. I will try to find it when I'm back at a computer.
Edit: This is all I can find now, but isn't the thread I was thinking of - 
I am 100% sure there was a thread explicitly stating that Roger tried a hardfork and failed, in relation to the invalid BU block. It was in the title. I can only assume it was deleted, which is good I guess.

@_date: 2017-03-07 16:01:54
I get what you're saying. My point is that those nodes won't be doing much validating if the majority transaction type is SegWit. For that reason, I consider "backward compatibility" of very little importance. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 19:54:06
Its too bad that you see it that way. 
I support a HF to bigger blocks based on the *fact* that fees are unnecessarily high and blocks are always full. I have no desire to "fire" core, I just want bitcoin to work.
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:43:20
You and I can do this dance until the end of time.
**There is currently no way to measure support for a hard-fork.** A twitter poll is worthless. Your reddit polls are worthless. Merge code that allows nodes and miners to signal their support. Then we can see if a HF has any legs.

Lets play a game. Which of these people is a bigger contributor?
- Developer A) 100 commits - All one letter typo fixes
- Developer B) 5 commits - All hundred+ lines of code

In this context, the "Core is evil" sentiment probably comes from Peter Todd's tweet about about the bug. It wasn't a disclosure like some are suggesting, but it no doubt drew more attention to the issue.
Core doesn't have a perfect track record either, there just haven't been any issues in recent memory. You can find a history here:

So what are you trying to show? You're not using actual numbers, by your own admission, but you're expecting the result to be an actual number.
Edit: This sounds more aggressive than I meant it to. I'm just curious what you're trying to show.
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:30:31
In my opinion, the miners are acting this way because of the slap-in-the-face that was the Hong Kong Agreement. They thought they were getting a commitment from Core, and they got nothing. So, its not really a demand for something new. More like, something we all already agreed to.
@_date: 2017-03-24 13:28:45

Sure.. but the important part would be doing it before miners split to BU, not after.
@_date: 2017-03-20 12:14:56


~~That was after Greg lashed out and said that the agreement had nothing to do with Core. The agreement was already broken in the eyes of the miners.~~ I was wrong about the timeline. It seems odd that F2Pool would void the agreement without being provoked.


Technically you are correct, however you can see how having five Core developers involved would imply an agreement from "the team", as you call it. 


It was coded, but the agreement took that requirement further by saying:


No hard-fork code has been merged into Core, so the requirement was not met.
Based on these points, I won't be revising my post.

@_date: 2017-03-01 18:56:16
You can disagree, but that doesn't mean you are correct.


Linear scaling of sighash operations is a nice feature but I was talking about scaling tps, not sighash operations. 


Yes, I touched on that when I said: "There will be a transaction throughput increase in SegWit when it is activated and used, but that is a byproduct."
I reiterate: SegWit is not a scaling solution, though it may offer a modest increase once fully utilized.
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:22:28

A hard-fork after is OK, but a hard-fork before is not?
They're both an emergency hard-fork in my opinion, and the latter is much more likely to have a positive result.
Anyway, since more than 0 people have voted for "Slower blocks (incl. effective capacity reduction) for a few months until difficulty adjusts (NO hardfork)" you know that all the other options are contentious and cannot happen, ever, in accordance with your definition of consensus.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:06:43


I would **start** running a Core node if it had support for a base block size larger than 1MB.
@_date: 2017-03-20 11:21:11
You should also include another scenario that is "hardfork to bigger blocks in a show of good faith. Miners will activate segwit. Threat of risky fork goes away."
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:14:11


Does it? I was under the impression that there was no way to run, say 0.14.0, and **not** signal for SegWit.
If what you say is true, I need to go correct some recent posts I've made...
@_date: 2019-03-06 13:17:59
The 6 nodes I checked have a capacity of 20 BTC each.
@_date: 2017-03-15 12:33:17
If you are insinuating that BU is not a threat, then you are mistaken or misinformed. 
Imagine a scenario where BU has 75% hash power and a miner mines a &gt;1MB block immediately after a difficulty change, causing all of the BU nodes and hash power to move to the forked chain. The Core miners will be faced with the same difficulty, but will only posses 25% of the hash power and block times will skyrocket. That seems like more than a wooden spoon to me.
@_date: 2017-03-21 11:28:03


@_date: 2017-03-01 20:37:05
So you would put Lumino, LN, and SegWit all in the same category of scaling solutions?
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:52:17
Technology changes rapidly. What might have been an issue in 2013 is not necessarily an issue now, in 2017. Compact blocks, XTHIN, FIBRE, etc have all been created to increase the performance of block relay.

I'm not a fan of a static 2-4MB hard fork, but it would give us more time to implement additional scaling solutions.

Lets be clear, I'm not against layer two solutions, but none exist right now. If we activated SegWit today, LN is still not ready.
Furthermore, I'm not against SegWit, but I'm not advocating for it either. There are pros and cons.
This isn't a great analogy, but here goes.. if there are 10 seats on the bus, and it costs $5 for a ticket we can say that the fee is $5. Thats great if there are 10 riders or less. What happens when rider 11 comes along and tries to pay his $5 fee? Sorry, no room pal, get the next bus. 
But that isn't how bitcoin works. What is rider 11 offers the driver $6 to kick someone else off, lets say rider 10. Now rider 10 is like wtf, I need to be on there, how about $7 for a seat? Now we have ourselves a bidding war.
The number of seats on the bus is a physical limit, but block space is not. It is being artificially limited, and inducing this bidding war, causing fees to rise. 
@_date: 2018-10-27 19:01:45
Don’t they consider an invoice paid when the transaction appears in their mempool?  It makes sense that they don’t want RBF transactions then. 
RBF enabled and a low fee looks like you’re trying to double spend on them.
Turn it off, it’s not a big deal.

Higher fees do *not* make more seats on the bus. You are pushing someone else out.

Thanks for the explanation. I'll remove "extended block" from my vocabulary.
Using this example, and looking at BIP 144, am I correct in saying that the script_witness is:


And further, can we then say that everything minus the script_witness is what will comprise the base size?
Generally, I am trying to determine the size difference in bytes, between a simple transaction today and a simple transaction in segwit not including the witness data.

How can you ignore the fact that at the time the 1MB limited was implemented, regular blocksize was nowhere near that? To fill a 1MB block in 2010 would have been obviously spam. Blocks were way under 100KB, so there was a &gt;900KB ceiling.
Now its 2016 and we are very regularly filling 1MB blocks with legitimate transactions. The space between legitimate transactions and the spam ceiling has evaporated. In my opinion, there is no way that this is what Satoshi intended. As was mentioned already, he left at a time when the spam ceiling was extremely far away. There was simply no reason to change the limit at that time.


That is a silly argument to make in favour of small blocks. He hasn't said *anything* since he left. If you changed the blocksize to 1KB, or to 100MB tomorrow, he probably STILL wouldn't say anything.

No, I don't understand that, because it isn't true. Generally, soft forks tighten block acceptance rules, and hard forks ease them. Do you understand that the preliminary SegWit work was based on a hard fork? Don't be afraid, my friend.


The purpose of this thread was to gauge the dev's attitude toward hard forks. and gave me the answer I was hoping for. "It's a possibility."
There isn't an immediate need for a HF right now, but fear mongering (maybe you'd prefer "concern trolling") about them could paint Bitcoin into a corner later.

What are you talking about? I am on record saying I like SegWit and dislike Emergent Consensus. There might even be a post where I said I support Core (it's only 13 days old if you go looking). For someone who has allegedly read my post history, it's funny you missed that.
I post more in the other sub because the discussion is free and open, it's as simple as that. 
Anyway, the fact that I want bigger blocks, like SegWit, post more in rbtc, whatever, has absolutely nothing to do with me being skeptic of the asicboost allegations against bitmain. There was no proof presented at all. Imagine if the roles were reversed. The Core disciples would be screaming "source?" at the top of their lungs.

All he needed to do was plant the seed in people's minds that Bitmain was blocking SegWit because of a propriety mining technique. I haven't seen any evidence that this is true, and its very difficult for Bitmain to disprove the allegations. Greg plays the game well, I will give him that.
I suspect we will see an increase in SegWit support now. If I were a miner, I would be pretty pissed that I've been mining at a disadvantage all this time, and I'd start working on getting back to a level playing field. Its as easy as activating SegWit.

Here is what we know about the HKA, and you will find your name on the list of attendees:
Then, here is the hard-fork code you wrote and recommended as per the HKA:
 - If you didn't support the agreement, why did you sign it?
 - If you didn't support it from your place as a Core developer, why are you listed as such? Adam changed his title, you could have changed yours if you wanted.
 - If you supported the hard-fork portion, why did you intentionally code one that violated other parts of the HKA? (see: "with the total size no more than 4 MB". Yours goes up to 31MB.)

The question becomes “what level of decentralization is enough?”
Decentralization is a fundamental property of Bitcoin, but we shouldn’t seek to forever be more decentralized at the expense of the other aspects of the system. Additionally, block size and decentralization are not directly bound to one another. You don’t magically become more decentralized by shrinking the block size, and you don’t become less decentralized by raising it (to a point).
There was a study a few years ago that examined how many nodes would fail to keep up as the block size was raised higher and higher. At the time they suggested that a 4MB block size wouldn’t hurt. I’ll find it later when I’m not on mobile.
@_date: 2018-02-21 12:43:23
This, and everything said.
Without the NYA agreement and a compromise on the side of the big blockers, UASF would have caused a chain split at best. UASF in itself didn't accomplish anything except the production of some hats in the same vein as "make america great again."
Edit: To put it plainly, SegWit was not happening. The NYA agreement laid out plains to activate SegWit and then hard fork to bigger blocks some time after. One side held up their end and activated SegWit, but the other side did not, and there was no hard fork. I highly doubt that trick will work again.

I think that a BIP9 deployment of MAST will be the fastest. It is proven that miners update/patch their nodes more frequently than users.
The reason I believe that MAST will be activated quickly is because there is no standing agreement of any kind holding it hostage. In comparison, miners that signed the HK Agreement refused to signal for SegWit because they believed that the conditions of the agreement were unfulfilled: hardfork code in core. (I don't care to discuss the legitimacy of the agreement or who is at fault for breaking it. That is irrelevant now.)

Maybe, but I think you're mistaken about the origin of the "wedge."
Core has been stonewalling a block size increase for years. There are people who think we desperately need bigger blocks, and those who think blocks are already too big.
Thus far, the only block size increase that Core has entertained is through SegWit, which will not provide an increase for many more months.
So, if the cause of the divide is Core's stonewalling, the effect is Bitcoin Unlimited.
This contentious hard fork was *not* born out of a desire to control the reference implementation.
@_date: 2016-10-12 13:03:13


Who is doing that? On-chain scaling is a huge desire of rbtc. If you're referring to blocking SegWit, I already suggested a reason as to why that might be.




I'm kind of blown away by this comment. This is the definition of FUD. There might be some people who want to fork and gain control over the protocol, sure. However, It is not correct to say that everyone who wants 2MB blocks wants to fork. That's just crap. We have been pushing for a block size increase because the 1MB cap was arbitrarily chosen years ago, and blocks are full, driving up fees and increasing transaction confirmation times.
Where did this PayPal 2.0 come from? I'm confused as to what you meant by that.

I tend to agree with stance that stalling blocksize changes is akin to railroading Bitcoin users into a new economic policy. 


seen in the entire 6 year history of bitcoin - is to stonewall work on
block size.
And he called what would happen as a result of the stalling, too:


*increases* the chances that progress must be made through a contentious
hard fork.

I am a big blocker who is forced to voice my opinion by showing support for BU.
In my case it has nothing to do with control over the protocol, and everything to do with listening to the community. Core will not entertain 2MB blocks, and the only way I can display my distaste for that is to support another implementation.
@_date: 2016-10-12 12:30:05
I don't think that's a very fair analysis of the situation. Blocks are full *now*, and bitcoin would benefit from a block size increase *now*. There is no argument I've seen against 2MB blocks that holds water. 
Big blockers have been pushing for a block size increase for a long, long time, and Core has effectively said "No way, Jose." I believe the threat to block SegWit is a last ditch effort to show Core that they need to listen to the entire community. The big block community is not small, despite what some people will have you believe.
Its my hope that when the time comes, SegWit will not be blocked. We need a fix for transaction malleability, we need the capacity increase that SeqWit will provide, but we also need a solution *now*. 
Finally, I think forking from Core is a bad idea. However, how else am I supposed to show them that I don't agree with their road map, aside from supporting BU?

Can you name someone other than yourself who believes the blocksize increase included in SegWit is controversial?
@_date: 2016-10-12 16:18:31
Sheesh, talk about ignorance! 


People love to quote that 4MB value...
"New nodes, which understand the full block with witness data, are therefore free to replace this limit with a new one, allowing for larger block sizes. Segregated witness therefore takes advantage of this opportunity to raise the block size limit to nearly 4 MB, and adds a new cost limit to ensure blocks remain balanced in their resource use (this effectively results in an effective limit closer to 1.6 to 2 MB)."
Source: 


I'm familiar with this, and I agree that it is an attack vector. However, its been addressed: 
ctrl+f for "MAX_BLOCK_SIGHASH"
Core's own protection thats built into-segwit could be used too:
"Segwit resolves this by changing the calculation of the transaction hash for signatures so that each byte of a transaction only needs to be hashed at most twice. This provides the same functionality more efficiently, so that large transactions can still be generated without running into problems due to signature hashing, even if they are generated maliciously or much larger blocks (and therefore larger transactions) are supported."

They reverted back to 1MB to prevent getting forked off the main chain by bad actors. They did not change their view on the need for 2MB.

You back up your speculation with more speculation...


You've resorted to telling me what I think. Looks like we're done here.


I was saying they survived a controversial hard fork with extremely little planning, and in a short window. If they can survive it under those circumstances, then we can surely survive one that is well planned. The comparison is more like removing a brain tumor via gunshot on the street, or surgically by a doctor, in a hospital.

It does it in a very dangerous way that I cannot support. When August arrives and people start losing money because of BIP148, know that you had a part in that.
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:40:35
While possible, that is improbable. 
SegWit being activated doesn't mean people will actually create the new style transactions. Day one I expect almost no change in the fee rates. As adoption grows, fees will come down gradually.

I am in favour of hard forking in order to implement sensible big-block code, but not without a super majority. How many nodes are signaling for UASF? 7%? lol

SegWit as a softfork is less risky than a hard fork to 2MB? I think you're dreaming.
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:05:40
You are correct, though I didn't say it was supported in software either.
There are at least three prominent Core developers who are pushing it (two heavily, one more getting there.) If you have been following along, you know who they are.

How do things get merged into Core, the reference software? 
I think a Core developer usually write codes, which then gets reviewed by others and merged, if there is agreement. While you are correct that developers != software, the former most definitely influences the latter.
BIP148 started with no Core dev support. Then Luke started pushing, then Eric, and now Peter is wearing a UASF hat.

If the NY agreement can be implemented with BIP91, while simultaneously locking in the other half of the agreement, that is fine with me.

He is serious, but he needs to work on his communication skills.
He means that nodes and wallets need to be upgraded before they will accept bigger blocks. That part is correct.
What I find funny is that this SegWit Soft Fork also requires everyone update nodes and wallets. Or in the words of Adam Back, just run an updated node as a gateway for your legacy node. So backwards compatible!

@_date: 2017-06-07 12:43:39
Lets see if I have this right...
1. Deploy SegWit with BIP9 and fail to get the required 95% miner support.
2. Release BIP148 with the sole intention of orphaning non-segwit blocks starting August 1st. (splitting the chain on purpose.)
3. Release splitprotection with BIP8 to "protect everyone" from the looming Aug 1st chain split, by activating  with a 65% support threshold over 504 blocks.
Seems kind of...sneaky? 
Further,  requires 1916 blocks (95%) in a retarget period to lock in, while  requires 327 blocks over a period 1/4th of that. Thats 16% support in a retarget period. A far cry from the 95% soft forks are supposed to require.

@_date: 2017-06-05 14:42:06
Unfortunately the wording of the NY agreement has left some room for interpretation of the block size increase.
If we maintain the weight ratio of 1:3 base to witness, that would leave us with the possibility of 8MB blocks. Of course, this would not be the case immediately after activation. ~~I expect no rational miner would risk creating such large blocks right off the bat for fear of them being orphaned.~~ Further, the block would need to be SegWit heavy in terms of transaction composition for it to even come close to 8MB.
Other options are changing the weight ratio to 1:2 or 1:1. Some SegWit critics say that the witness discount is a sticking point for them, and some pro-Segwiters say that changing the weight ratio is a violation of the NY agreement in itself.
Edit: sp and a word.

@_date: 2017-06-21 00:36:40
To be clear: the maximum size a block can be is 8MB, if every transaction is extremely witness heavy, *and* miners don't use any soft limits. If there are zero SegWit transactions, the max size a block can be is 2MB.
Similarly, BIP141 allows a maximum size of 4MB under the same conditions (witness heavy). It has been speculated that the norm will become 1.7-2.3MB. Using the same logic, blocks in SegWit2x would be around 3.4-4.6MB. That is in line with academic study about safe block sizes.
It's not so scary when you frame it without all the fearmongering.

When SegWit is active, imagine a scenario where the mempool has 10MB worth of transactions in it, which are all legacy style. How big can the largest block be?
Edit: I was replying to your message before it was deleted... this is what I was going to say:
The largest block would be 1 MB.
Anything larger than 1 MB will fail this check from consensus.h:

What are your arguments against raising the block size?
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:29:12
Point 7 in the OP and your post are both ridiculous. It feels like you're trying to set up a "grassroots movement" to lower the blocksize. We don't need a lower blockweight/size, just like we don't need larger block intervals. Putting all your eggs into lightning or other sidechains is a recipe for disaster. 
* Reducing the blockweight/size will not magically sprout new full nodes. If people aren't running one now, it is unlikely that they will run one if you decrease to 300kb (Luke's example.) 
* Reducing the blockweight/size will not change miners attitude toward validating. They start mining on the new block before verifying so they can get a jumpstart on finding the next block. 


Is membership really \*required?\* I don't think so. 
Are miners not connected to FIBRE really taking "huge losses"? 
* Block compression and propagation techniques will only get better over time.
* CPU speed and bandwidth only increase over time
TLDR: There is no need to artificially limit the base layer. There is nothing to gain, and everything to lose.
@_date: 2017-06-16 16:00:29

@_date: 2017-06-23 18:27:11
I think you are confused. You said there is no base block size anymore. I'm saying go look in consensus.h and you will find it.
Wallets that are capable of creating SegWit transactions are not forced to do so. If every single wallet was updated, but everyone chose to send legacy transactions, those blocks could not be larger than 2MB.
Further, consider a scenario where there is 2MB worth of legacy transactions in the mempool, and a miner chooses to include all of those transactions in a block. Even if there is 10MB worth of SegWit transactions available to be mined, that block still will not exceed 2MB because the base size is already full.

No. Double dipping with regulated futures and unregulated shorts won’t be profitably anymore.

In this case, I just want to maintain the status quo. There is no immediate danger in leaving things the way they are. Making the changes you and Luke mentioned will absolutely effect the economic policy of Bitcoin in unknown ways.


I appreciate the spin attempt.
I like lightning and have always said so. It has huge potential. I've set up a node, tested it out and made purchases. I know it works.
Right now I can use lightning, or I can transact on the base layer. Stop trying to take options away from me.

Well, the code is a WIP, but the medium post by DCG says:


Seems like they really did mean for SegWit to activate, not just lower the threshold.
@_date: 2017-06-20 18:59:27


They don't? 
Why did they say that in HK last year, NY this year, and now are indicating their intention to signal for bigger blocks when SegWit2x is released?
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:21:20
You didn't answer my question. I'll try it a different way: 
After activation, assuming there are only legacy transactions in the mempool, how big can the biggest block be?
I'll help you out: anything except "2MB" is the wrong answer.

I'm telling you what the code dictates, and you seem to be trying to guess at how that code will be used by millions of wallets. I said in my original post that there is an 8MB weight limit and a 2MB base size limit. I don't know what you're arguing about.

Its not a lie. Its my opinion based on what I have read over the last few weeks here. If you disagree, fine, but calling me a liar is childish.

Lmao that didn't take long. You guys are hilarious.
@_date: 2017-06-23 21:07:36
It is shocking that you can't understand what that post says.
No matter how high you raise the max weight value, there is *still* a check that will invalidate blocks with &gt; 2MB of legacy transactions. 
That really sounds like two limits to me.

The code is not obfuscated in any way. In order for a 2MB base block size to be valid, the weight must be raised to 8MB. This is in line with SegWit's 1MB base size and 4MB weight.

with the current mining difficulty too.

Answer me this simple question:
After activation, how big can a block be assuming there are only legacy transactions in that block?
@_date: 2013-10-09 00:13:18
Interesting. Thanks for pointing that out.
@_date: 2013-10-23 15:15:12
That's not what I had in mind. The price discrepancy is pretty annoying regardless.
@_date: 2017-06-20 17:28:11
SegWit2x gives the miners what they've been asking for since 2015, which is a block size increase. In 2016 they said they would support SegWit at the same time as a blocksize hardfork was merged into Core. That didn't happen, so now they are committing to the exact same thing, with a different dev team.
@_date: 2013-06-14 11:07:21
do you have contact info I can display?

has the code been publicly audited?
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:58:36
I believe it is because they are supporting SegWit2x. That proposal includes SegWit BIP141 and a hardfork to 2MB base block size. If they want the HF, they must also support BIP141. The "Until July" probably means end of July, aka, before Aug 1st. If BIP148 splits the chain, they will HF (not SegWit2x), 12 hours after. If that occurs, SegWit will not be part of the new chain to begin with. They go on to explain that it might be added later, after investigation.

The prices would be quoted in USD with BTC as a payment option. I agree with your analysis. Thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:26:42
Doesn't it say that items can't be *priced* in BTC? To me that means that merchants can sell goods for BTC but they must be priced in official currency.
