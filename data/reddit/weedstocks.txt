$8650 was a good outlook. $5k is easy.

People buying bitcoin now are grandmothers and plumbers. When I hear the lady in the airport knitting a sweater talking about how much money she is going to make, but has never heard of a blockchain, RUN. They do NOT understand bitcoin and are throwing money at it to make a buck. Watch out for a 50-60%+ correction in the coming weeks. What the wise man does at the beginning, the fool does at the end.

FYI if you guys get bored with this one, you can research Forrest Fenn's $2M treasure he hid in the Rockies. Still unclaimed after 5+years and everything you need to solve it is in the poem.. Good luck
