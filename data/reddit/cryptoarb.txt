it's about time bitcoiners stop bashing and accept litecoin as a peer and a complement that helps solving many bitcoin's problems, starting with this one regarding the block size. been saying that for almost 2 years. wake up taaaards.

and I was pretty fucking damn right but for one minor detail: after stealing 80% off btc price on gox, they managed to buy at 50% discount on any other market too:
Creditors will have two options. They can either receive a prorated amount from the 200,000 bitcoins recovered by Mt. Gox equal to roughly 20 percent of their claim, or obtain an equity stake of that amount in the revitalized Mt. Gox exchange.
The investor group pledged to set aside 50% of transaction fees to pay back creditors over time.

if you check bitcoinbuilder.com the discount it's 25%. that's a price that makes sense, below that selling it's pure idiocy. if you know just a bit about payout/probabilty scenarios you don't sell below 70-75% unless it's fake selling aimed to artificially push the price down. i believe 85% of the trades on gox below 75% discount were fake and 15% just idiots selling on panic mode.

well, after the statement: may lead us into considering closing your account. I would have said:
you know what, please, do it right now. close it. who cares. I'll open an account somewhere else. Thanks and Goodbye.

I believe this, it's just insider trading and market manipulation. and they are profiting bigtime from it.

exactly, there was just too much money here to be made. and nobody could make it because the gox's box was closed. doesn't make sense unless the whole thing was rigged. stupidity could be an alternative explanation, but too much stupidity doesn't add up. Why sell below 200, or even much less below 100 at 20% of market price? You must be totally idiot. Here's why: if you sold and gox is really busted you end up losing everthing (you've got to be really naive to hope getting some real usd after a legal action ), if it's solvent, you lose 4/5 of your btcs. it's a lose lose situation. on the contrary, buying btc at huge discount is the real opportunity presenting a lose-huge win situation: if gox is really busted you end up losing everthing (same as above), but if it's solvent you make at least a 500% gain. So it was fake selling. can't be otherwise. Can't believe there were still people selling below 200, nobody could be so idiot.

"It's not like the Gold market where they can naked short",
yes you can, with leverage up to 20x

this is fishy, someone was selling mid and quarter in big size since yday and knew in advance this was going to happen.

no big banks involved, as someone said: big banks are not giving a single fuck about Bitcoin.
it's just a few whales on OKCoin. they squeezed it from 220 to over 230 last week in order to screw some idiot who recklessly shorted 38k futures, now they are selling in order to get 15m $ at bitfinex from a few stupid idiots who bought with leverage between 225 and 300$ from february the 23rd till the end of march.
below 210 these idiots will start to panick and will be forced into liquidation below 180$. the whales on okcoin want that easy money, and will get it.
