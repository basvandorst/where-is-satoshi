Corner store not coffee shop.  I go there for my coffee, but they also have other corner store items.

I assumed you didn't.  I would really like to see someone create a mainstream app that incorporates Bitcoins system.  Doesn't it seem like Circle is kind of making its way there...?

I hate stupid responses.

I could see how usernames would be helpful in mass adoption/ease of use. However, if we want to keep Bitcoin as secure as possible, isn't reusing addresses (assuming a single address is associated with a username) not very secure?  
I appreciate the thoughtful response, I am going to keep your ideas in mind.

That's the message I got. Not sure if it's been claimed?

I can agree with this. Price is good and so is the adoption it brings, if we want our technology to advance we need people focusing on growth of the system rather than price pumps.

I’d suggest checking out Coinigy. Developed in Wisconsin, awesome team, great platform. $20 a month which will easily pay itself off with their advanced tools.

agreed and i agree to the point saying he gave away tons of Bitcoin. I may have been a recipient... back then faucet sites were giving away free $20 bills (in todays BTC $ price ;) )
