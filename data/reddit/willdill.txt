500k on quad
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:40:03
What? I'm trying to transfer 300$ out of bread wallet and the fee is 60$.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:48:51
not in my wallet unfortunately, I use breadwallet, If you know a way to circumvent this, please do tell.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:29:58
Look at me, i am your cold storage now.....
Said the thief to the newly acquired stolen bitcoins
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:46:39
Ok that makes sense. And can I load that passphrase on two different apps, let's say I have mycelium and breadwallet which are both compatible with the 12 word phrase, can I just have both wallets on my phone both showing the same balance?
 
The reason I ask this is that I cant personalize the fees on breadwallet so it charges like 30% but on mycelium I can personalize the fees.

I dont know why people are so obsessed with the dips and what not especially when the majority of people here probably have less than 1k invested. I say send all your coin to a paper wallet, store the private key somewhere safe, and completely forget about it for a couple years.

My first friend in life has very rich parents and are the only very rich people ive met and they actually do seem kinda outta of the reality loop...theyre super nice...but weird
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:12:34
Bro im a dumbass and i literally learned everything i need to know to 
A) purchase btc without getting fucked
B) safely store my btc
C) and quickly cash it out if ever i want to.
All in under a week of research.
Pm me if you need help
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:40:11
Yeah cause i want to forget about my coins and delete all the apps and re install them in like 5 years
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:00:48
Didnt find any relevant info.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:27:23
Please sir, tell me mord
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:09:27
Well rich as in their house was a mansion worth 8 million dollars and they had a nanny living in her own section of the mansion. The driveway was 5 km long
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:14:02
So what happens if let's say...breadwallet and mycellium disappear over night, how would I recover my btc?
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:41:49
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:31:02
Ok and how would I know if breadwallet stores the private keys online?
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:02:29
Youtube google and reddit
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:55:30
Could you recommend a few?
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:55:09
Do you know of any relutable ones?
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:10:49


False, I've recovered wallets many time with just the passphrase.
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:13:19
Oh ok, what are these standards? I tried the same recovery phrase on mycellium and breadwallet and it worked, but on blockchain, it accepted the phrase but no balance ever showed up.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:48:26
Sooo a wallet app is secure?
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:54:05
Hey could you please explain to me the difference between a private key and a 12 word passphrase that I use to recover my funds? As of right now, I've been using a wallet app and I have never even seen my private key...
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:59:23
Lol i swear to god i posted a TIL on bitcoin about the winklevoss twins owning gemini a week ago it got downvoted to hell and everyone was saying how much of scam it is
@_date: 2017-12-14 01:26:58
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:03:45
So as long as I have that 12 word passphrase I can delete all my apps and come back 5 years down the road and use that pass phrase to get my btc?
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:14:31


Hi, newb here, care to elaborate?
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:08:23
Tried it did accept my recovery phrase but still showed a zero balance. Those btcs are lost somewhere
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:00:27
EDIT: I AM A HUGE DUMBASS. This issue was 100% my fault and and the breadwallet support team was absolutely great. I have had ZERO issues with this app since I have had it. I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience but at least I learned a good lesson.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:06:15
Thanks. So far though they are telling me to do basic install re install. It seems to be much deeper than that. It really looks like the btc and all last transactions have disappeared
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:35:21
Oh well ok, so in general, wouldn't it be safer to have your funds spread out on several different apps, so if something happens to one app, well your funds are already also on a different app?
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:41:34
Dude relax with your 10% people are happy to help!

@_date: 2017-11-04 12:29:35
Almost as bad as thinking coinbase is a wallet right? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:57:38
I use mycellium...well when I copy paste a receive adress,, that adress changes when the transaction is complete to a new adress.
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:33:02
I created a second wallet when i got a new phone end of sept. When the app initially crashed during the transaction. I mistakengly typed in the seed of  my first wallet...in which the balance was zero. What added to the confusion though was that the app kept crashing and asking again and again for a recovery phrase (even though the one I typed in was legit and actually worked) so the app being glitchy misled me into thinking it was the app the problem when in fact it was my own dumbass who had completely forgotten i had created a second wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:21:45
Already tried both those things several times 
The seed words work but it still doesnt show a balance and doesnt sync past 60% or so and thenit crashes making me repeat the process
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:44:02
Ive tried exactly that SEVERAL times
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:00:22

@_date: 2017-11-03 13:00:18
Man this really sucks the app seems to be working now but shows a ZERO balance when i should definitely have a balance :(
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:33:49
Mt gox? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:18:00
Yeah but why? To keep dumbasses from screenshotting their keys?
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:59:27
Yup both transactions were completed is what it is says on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:08:48
Yes tried that multiple times
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:51:11
Ok do you work for them? 
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:56:10
Really? Wow ok im def gonna try that
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:09:11
Ok thanks man
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:08:14
Hey the other user is right. Although coinbase acts like a wallet. It is not. They hold the private keys for you. Make sure you understand that. Then again. I do and im still in a pickle
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:46:09
Thank you can you further elaborate on the whole fork. Ive tried looking it up. Its like every past stays the same but on a new chain on the newer transactions will be independant of each othed but my question is why? Why are there so many cryptos isnt btc awesome enough as it is?
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:00:11
EDIT: I AM A HUGE DUMBASS. This issue was 100% my fault and and the breadwallet support team was absolutely great. I have had ZERO issues with this app since I have had it. I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience but at least I learned a good lesson.

Why is blockchain a poor choice its one of the most highly rated ones on play store
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:30:23
Well samourai doesnt have a 16 word seed as it seems?
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:00:06


@_date: 2017-11-03 18:54:35
100% positive as it accepts it and shows two transactions that i did in fact make in september
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:16:13
Care to elaborate i thought network fees were suppose to be a fraction of 1%
You this is really too bad because one of the main selling points of btc in the first place was "incredibly low transaction cost" i feel like i just got raped now
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:42:51
"Coming out soon"
"Fix the issue immediately"
Those are two very different things.
Anyways, anyway you can help me out by forwarding all this to someone?
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:24:43
ummm...but I want bitcoins, not monero or litecoin, could you elaborate abit please? I am new to this.
@_date: 2017-11-04 13:15:54
Sorry I am a newb and I did not understand any of that
@_date: 2017-11-03 19:19:05
Where can i find the 64 digit bitcoin transaction id. Btc was purchased through coinbase. Cant find that number anywhere and support is requesting them
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:47:44
Oh so even though in my wallet app, the adress changes, the old ones are still valid and will still send to my wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:52:43
I have btc on a few different wallets. Does this make me automatically eligible to get these bt2 after the fork? And how do i get them?
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:05:23
Its on android galaxy s8 had no issues before yesterday i moved some btc from coinbase and before the transaction was complete this started happening and yes i have the seed words with me
@_date: 2017-11-03 20:29:03
Yes on coinbase all the info is there saying everything went through
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:42:16
I did send an email and no response so far.
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:26:09
It was working fine up until two days ago.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:28:35
did you use speech to text for this?
And cool thanks that clears it up! thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:45:35
Yeah my question is, let's say I have the breadwallet app opened on my phone and I download another app, and put in my 12 word seed in the new app...what happens to the funds in my breadwallet app? Will they simply disappear?
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:49:03
Takes about an hour. Completes but no transactions except mty first two i made back in september and shows an zero balance
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:56:34
Yeah absolutely! Coinbase is like bottled water. Its fucking expensive when you think of it but youre paying for the convenience
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:58:22
ah ok...ummm.. I feel like I am misunderstanding something...
I understand that a  paperwallet adress would obviously never change but why are these apps providing me with new adresses everytime I send btc into them.
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:58:55
Oh ok. Is this a common problem? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:54:55
Ah ok cool
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:00:28
haha my bad dude, there was no context to my comment.
The context is that the user I replied to was saying yesterday that coinbase is a wallet. Coinbase is NOT wallet, so I was just poking fun at him that's all. I use coinbase all the time and im grateful for how easy and user friendly it is.
here is the link for context:
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:03:20
Whats a marketcap?
Does this mean there is 31 billion more dollars in btc since yesterday? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 03:25:36
Well wtf is up with all this?
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:00:31
EDIT: I AM A HUGE DUMBASS. This issue was 100% my fault and and the breadwallet support team was absolutely great. I have had ZERO issues with this app since I have had it. I'm terribly sorry for the inconvenience but at least I learned a good lesson.
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:27:47
Rookie mistake.....final answer lol
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:44:06
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:26:58
Ok thanks and dont worry ill definitely give a positive update if the issue is resolved.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:43:25
Tried that 10 times didnt work im on android
@_date: 2017-11-04 12:58:59
Ummm..interesting. So Let's say I want to have nothing to do with the first wallet, I would then have to actual do a transaction from the first wallet to the second...
So my plan of using the recovery phrase to avoid fees is shit?
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:12:16
There have been several stories on reddit lately of frozen accounts, pending withdrawals, etc. And im not spreading FUD. I LOVE btc and ive been absolutely studying it day and night but i feel like if i had several 100k in it id be scared shitless about moving it from a wallet to an exchange
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:27:50
Thanks for the answers as for the transaction ID it says 2 confirmations out of 6
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:11:53
Hey thanks for the reply!
I just noticed that coinbase does not support a "selling" feature on their site (im in canada) so how would you recommend for me to sell my bitcoins if ever I want to?
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:53:31
Nah, the program is Reason 9.5. And im more than happy to pay for it because I used a pirated copy of Reason 5 for over 8 years :)
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:26:45
That was caused by debris on the runway. Nothing to do with the plane
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:36:23
And those exchanges are the ones you mentioned up there?
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:45:41
Thanks man i appreciate the help!
One last question, ive notice there are fees to transfer so its only logical that i need to be sure i want to sell before transfering my bitcoins out correct?
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:16:52
Hey i just downloaded breadwallet! Am i generating a new wallet or am i recovering a wallet? My btc are on coinbase at the moment
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:31:12
Ah ok, I'll download the app then I guess!
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:52:28
No. im using the software right now...and its fully registered and licensed under my account now on the company website...
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:56:17
Hey sorry apparently it worked but when i went back to my wallet it was a different number does it change the second you copy/use it?
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:41:35
Well, im just worried I actually wont have time to do all that before it expires.
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:48:41
Cool thanks!!! So i can transfer from coinbase to one of those right? 
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:04:42
Hi can someone tell me exactly how i can buy bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:56:37
Yup 6400$ right now
@_date: 2017-09-10 18:29:42
I guess the next step is to transfer the btcs from coinbase to one of the aboved mentioned?
@_date: 2017-10-31 12:45:50
Or to americans who mistake CAD for USD :)
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:29:40
Am i the only canadian here who is like "but bro btc has passed 5k" weeks ago
@_date: 2017-10-12 12:30:26
Ha weird i just finished watching his documentary, what a weird mother fucker.
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:17:24
I am and Reason 9.5 is a  POWER house. The vst integration is flawless
@_date: 2017-09-10 19:29:45
So now i have my bitcoins in my breadwallet! I understand that i can only send and receive from there right so i would now need to send those bitcoin to for example one of those exchanges you mentioned to then sell them
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:02:29
Yeah fuck em, I'm just gonna use quadriga now! Thanks!
@_date: 2018-02-09 08:39:58
Wut? No the savings come from the seller selling at a discounted price to sell quickly...
What kind of retarded comment was that?
@_date: 2019-05-12 13:42:52
Like who wakes up in the morning and thinks of doing this? Lol
