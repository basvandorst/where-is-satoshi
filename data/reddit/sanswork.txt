Do you honestly believe this?  


Bitcoin is dying because it doesn't do anything better than existing technologies and has a name that is associated with criminality to most potential users.  A small user base can have increasing transactions without growing easily(see the load tests) even more so when the cost to increase the transaction count by self trading is almost nil.  Check days destroyed.

Bitcoin as been accessible for years with little to no growth in active userbase because it just straight up isn't better at anything that most people need or want.
Bitcoin has barely left the starting blocks let alone come near any sort of tipping point.  I'm not looking into the future though.  I'm looking into the recent past and it's saying "bitcoin is going no where".

Bitcoin isn't good for totalitarian countries since it is easy to block bitcoin from easy use when you control a countries internet.


Most people aren't though and for them it works great.  Your ignorance doesn't make the process bad.  You think it is bad to risk someone over charging you.  Yet you recommend bitcoin where you have 0 recourse if the merchant just doesn't send you anything.  


Like where?  Which countries fit this that also have stable open internet access?


People have been saying this for years.  It isn't going to happen.  


Yeah it is because it happens already today.  I have plenty of programs that pay per request for various APIs today.


Ok add one confirmation click to your debit card and yes chargebacks are available even if you are ignorant of them.  With bitcoin no chargeback is possible if a merchant screws you.

Almost no one actual cares about this.  It is a niche feature.


In banking today almost everything is already immutable.  You not knowing this says a lot.  They can force people to create new transactions because they know the participants.  That doesn't make it mutable.


Again it doesn't matter it only needs to be distributed amongst the participants.  A startup in bangladesh is very unlikely to be a participant in a blockchain with JP Morgan.

Op sounds like he still expects them to be mining by his comments about plateauing and limits of hardware.  
He also thinks Bitcoin has a huge number of contributing developers so it sounds like he knows very little about current chains or the proposed private chains.
As for security it will depend entirely on protecting signing keys and banks already have hardware to do that even if you do have access to their internal network so it'll be very secure.  Besides that if I hack it what would I do? Sign w transfer from bank a to bank b. Well bank a just tells b what happened and bank b creates a new transaction sending the money back and problem solved.

So are lots of things that have grown a hell of a lot faster.  Even the internet grew much faster and that required buying a computer, modem, finding an ISP and signing up.  Because it was better than the alternatives.  This is where bitcoin fails.  It isn't any better than what exists unless you hold very niche political views.
The internet has made the spread and growth of everything that is non-physical so much faster that comparing preinternet growth rates is pointless.  But still bitcoin stagnates.

Ya bit not using bitcoin.   Hence bitcoin is insignificant.
All your replies to economic issues are just no.  That isn't a response that is denial.


There are ways for them to do that currently so why don't they?  Because they don't have enough money to do so because they are poor.  And you want them to risk what little they have on a high risk investment?


Right, and you don't think these companies can afford more GPUs than you?  Any change in hash function will lead to rapid centralization and a crash in value of bitcoin.


Right, and I can swallow packets of cash too.  Or I can buy jewellery for a markup that I sell to a partner store in another country for the same amount(they do this between mainland china and macau for example).  There are ways around everything it doesn't mean they are good or accessible.

Where is that?


Surely the stress tests should tell you how cheap and easy it is for a single user to massively increase transaction volume.
Transaction numbers are about the worst metric to use.  Bitcoin INC can't tell us but bitcoin companies can.  They just won't and the only reason a company that would gain from social proof refuses to release numbers is because they are stagnant or shrinking.
Look at changetip.  They promised for a while last year to release transaction figures at the start of the year then they all got too busy to run 'SELECT count(id), sum(amount), date_format(created_at, yyyy-mm-dd) from tips group by date_format(created_at, yyyy-mm-dd) and make a blog post.  For an entire year.  That was literally bashco's excuse they were too busy.

Why do you think that would be better?  With blocks you can batch transactions from multiple sources so you would have less overhead.
Bitcoin will continue to putter along with no interest from the general public.  Services built only on it will start to shut down as there is a lack of users.  Changetip, bitpay go first.  Projects like streamium continue to have no users and the devs get bored and move on to other things.  OB is a flop with only a few shops opening all of which are hobby operations because after the first week there are no users.
21inc pivots from its plan you do consumer embedded miners as new tech renders their miners obsolete.  The board votes the shut down operations and liquidate returning what they can to investors.
Coinbase realizes it will never beat PayPal and their unwillingness to work with gaming sites makes them even less appealing than netteller they go the way of 21inc.
Purse is sued by Amazon and forced to stop integration with their service.  Fold folds since their business depends on giving customers their whole margin.

Satoshi, the winklevoss, roger ver, mp, and the bit stamp guys alone have like 15% of the coins.  That's 5 people there are definitely a few more with over 100k coins in there control so you're looking at the top 2 dozen people or so controlling around 25-30% of the currency and you don't think it is more unevenly distributed?
There are around 1800 addresses with more than 1000 Bitcoin so assuming 1 million users and each of those as a unique user when in reality a bunch will be owned by the same people and a bunch shared that means the top 0.18% owns 44% of the coins.  That's only if we assume 1 million total Bitcoin users up it to 2 million and it's even worse.

If you have a million euros you can already transfer them for free or near enough.  Almost every bank is going to offer free wires to you and if they don't it would be like 0.002% fee(flat rate too so 2 million euros wouldn't cost you any more)

Or they got hacked.


It would be recoverable in almost all cases.
It's actually easier to get scammed with Bitcoin because there are no consumer protections.  Search scam in the top right for thousands of examples.  It's even possible for simple mistakes to cost customers money.  Search for new egg and tiger direct for examples of that.
The thing you are missing is that it doesn't matter if your credit card number gets hacked.  You get a new one and life goes on.  That isn't a loss for customers of their money at all.

The suitcase thing is also wrong.  The cartel was delivering money in boxes that fit through the teller window they didn't build a special window for them.

Depends on how you define censored.  It can certainly be blocked from use in legal transactions pretty easily.  That's all censoring does is stop legal applications so by that definition it certainly can be censored.
But by the fact that over 6 years later the bitcoin userbase is still tiny should maybe give you a hint that 'transferable digital bearer asset that can't be censored' isn't something people want.

There have been lots of services to make it very easy to move very small quantities of cash around.  As I've said repeatedly.  They've all failed because no one actually wants to move very small quantities of cash around.


No.  First up it isn't my theory, and secondly the research states that it doesn't matter how low the price is the cost is there.
It isn't predicting the future it is looking at the fact that this isn't the first time someone has tried micropayments(as I said) it isn't even in the first 100 times.  The overhead for getting started with the others is actually lower than with bitcoin and yet they all still failed and largely for the same reasons.

The thing is in trying to solve every problem bitcoin is really bad at solving any problem.  In every field it can compete it is is very easy to create a competitor that beats it.
People here are obviously very upset at the idea of private blockchains because they have spent the entire time since investing in Bitcoin believing that bitcoin would fill all those roles.  But it doesn't mean those solutions aren't blockchains or that they are destined to failure or that the technology isn't a good match for the problem set.  In lots of cases they will be but there are still a lot where they are a good match.

Yes but that doesn't mean they can't do it for less.  Like they do for p2p payments which are free so even cheaper than Bitcoin.  It just means they don't have to do it for less.
No they wouldn't there have been studies done in it and the mental cost of micropayments makes them a non-starter.  Google the mental cost of micropayments and you should find sources.
Also unless you have a really shit shit you're making more than a hundredth of a cent per user on ads.

The point is though that bitcoin isn't going to support many of those $0.03 transactions so you're going to be doing them offchain which means you're still going to have to sign up for another site.  The only difference is on that site you'll first have to go to another site(or in personal) and buy a different currency to fund your account.


Of course it is.  If all previous micropayment attempts which make use of widely used currencies have failed why would you expect one making use of a niche one to succeed?


The same thing that makes them not want it now.  Mental cost in deciding if they are going to pay the $0.03 or not.  No one wants to do that.  Plenty of people in tech say they do but give them the option and they will take the ad sponsored method everytime(or find ways around it like when articles from that one bitcoin news site which uses micropayments like this gets posted and people instantly hit the comments asking subscribers to post the content so they don't have to pay).

Good luck with it but you can either go with making it a business and trying to make money or just making it a hobby and having fun.  You're trying to do the former by excluding just about the only revenue possible and it will just discourage you.  Are you really going to want to keep updating the site 2 months from now when you've made $0 if your expectation is to make money?
If you don't care about revenue then go 100% with it just being a hobby and drop the geek store and stuff which no one will use.

That is such a cop out response and it's so common here.  "X will succeed because the internet/Google/Email succeeded and everyone hated the internet/Google/Email in the early days!" 
For starters in 2000 I was actually using and actively promoting Google to my friends.  I've been doing this a long time and I've seen lots of companies come and go since the mid 90s.  Many with even more funding than 21co.  You learn to spot certain similarities which tend to mean the company will be a flop and which ones won't.  I'm obviously not always right but I have a pretty good track record of not having to switch providers because they are shutting down.
One involved finding a way to monetize search.  They went with advertising which wasn't unusual, even the way they did it wasn't novel since Overture had been doing it for a while by that point.  The other requires breaking the bitcoin PoW algorithms to make it profitable to put low power chips in devices.  Which would in the end cause the difficulty to increase far enough to either (a) make your break pointless and the devices worthless again or (b) force the core developers to switch the PoW algorithms and make your devices worthless again.

Ya, see how well that goes over with the public when they find out you're using their power to give money to website/service owners.  Look at the recent NJ case for an example.
Sidechains still require a transaction which still require the minimum transaction level.  You're thinking of payment channels.
The miners they could put in any consumer device would not mine enough bitcoin to even pay a half a penny to a publisher a day per user.
21co sold some grand dream of a chip in every device to raise money(and at a much lower difficulty level).  They're just another mining chip manufacturer though and since they can't do magic the current difficulty level makes their dream unobtainable.

Yes, for the reason you just replied to with 'this is bullshit'.  Cash isn't an investment it is a unit of exchange.


Poor don't have enough money to invest.


Supply of bitcoin could change in the future if a consensus of miners decides its better for their bottom lines.


If you change the hash function you remove all the security from bitcoin and make it instantly worthless as you now have a bunch of well funded companies and the first one to make an asic chip for the new function will have total control of the network.  Bitcoin is stuck with double sha.

Except unless all those devices are paying you they won't.


Do you think all investments from VCs are successes?  Do you think no company with investment has to pivot?  And to answer your question no I don't think either of them expected the difficulty to increase so much.  I think they expected that their money would buy them vastly superior mining chips and that didn't pan out and since everyone else has as good of, or near as good of chips theirs aren't profitable enough for their last plan of putting them in consumer devices.

Bitcoin isn't better for online payments unless you are a merchant.  It isn't better for in person payments.  It isn't better for remittance.  It isn't good at micropayments.

I don't see how anything that they are doing would help.  The time to mine the minimum amount of bitcoin required to make a single transaction on a low powered device would mean you might be able to do one transaction per year(I think it was actually once every 15 years according to calculations done at the time of the original release).  In comparison I could have one of the previous services automatically charge my credit card $10 every time my balance got low and many of the previous services offered this.  Guess what?  No one cared.  The need to refill the wallet wasn't the blocking factor.  Distaste for microtransactions, mental costs, etc where the blocking factor.

The Bitcoin protocol doesn't stop companies using it from needing to follow KYC anymore than this will.

Same.  Gold use to be used as money.  Devaluing currency makes sense because it is an IOU for work done.  Work done longer ago is worth less.  Besides you shouldn't be investing your money in cash it should be in proper investments in which case inflation doesn't matter.  Only the very poor and the stupid invest in cash.  The former doesn't have enough to matter and the later won't for long.


Define sound.  There has been at least one forced rollback and the miners that control 90% of the hashrate can share a large couch.

Even paywalls on news sites(which were essentially meant to be the same thing) are starting to disappear again as they have largely been a failure.  Given two options one with ads and one with micropayments people will take the ads everytime.
The original post is wrong anyhow.  Netflix didn't win because of people not wanting ads.  Netflix won because of on-demand/the ability to binge watch shows you wouldn't otherwise combined with the low cost per month compared to traditional cable where you might pay 10x as much just to have the same variety as Netflix.

Replace the word problems with use cases if it is confusing you.


Online shopping, Offline shopping, remittance, micropayments.


These private blockchains aren't designed to have applications built on them they are the application.


This isn't an issue for private blockchains.  
You seem to have the same problem a lot of people here have.  You aren't able to shift your viewpoint from bitcoin so you see everything through a bitcoin lense.  So everytime someone does something different you go "But it doesn't handle X which bitcoin does" without realizing that for most applications that doesn't matter and the techniques that bitcoin use to handle X actually make it a hinderance.

Bitcoin bubbles too.




Most unbanked are unbanked by choice and very few actually have any savings so inflation doesn't matter because they are living pay to pay.  The ones that do have a bit really shouldn't be investing it into an unstable and high risk speculative investment.


The wonders of credit and debit cards made paying for stuff online a breeze decades ago.  Difficulty in safe online storage and risk of total loss plus lack of consumer protections actually makes bitcoin a worse option.  There is a post on the subreddit right now about a nightmare situation with newegg and bitpay both reputable companies fucking up something simple like a refund.


All bitcoin does is add 2 more currency exchanges to the process.  Even bitcoin remittance companies are admitting it doesn't help much.  Moving money between countries is the cheapest part of remittance.  It it the last mile that is the most expensive and bitcoin doesn't help with that at all.


Machines can pay machines easily lots of ways but no one wants micropayments so it's not really and issue people will just get subscriptions and batch pay.

I can get protection against inflation lots of ways in USD, it's just as easy if not easier to use a credit card or debit card, charge backs are a vendor issue and don't belong in a discussion about customer adoption, and bitcoin and a debit/credit card allows great tracking of your spending habits.

Bullshit.  Everyone on this subreddit seems to think them selves tax evasion masterminds.  All of your techniques are easily audited.


Which is great.  The offshore corporate pays property taxes and you still have to explain your income for rent.  This does nothing to avoid income taxes.


Provide a client list.  You can't just say "I have a bunch of clients paying me money" if you get audited.  Especially with an service like that where you will have client lists.
It isn't any easier to evade taxes with bitcoin than without.  Both ways leave trails proportional to the amount your trying to hide.
This is all ignoring the fact that 99% of people work for another company and can't effectively implement these strategies you suggest nor do 99.9% of people make enough money to do it either.

Using a spread for their profit is hiding the fees on the customer side.  Which is exactly what I said and not false.
The merchant gets exactly what they ask for so to them it looks like 0% but because of the spread the customer pays a bit more than if they were paying using another payment means.

So how does their system know that something has been paid for to start the delivery process or is that all manual?


How many clients pay in bitcoin?  Again I'm sure you'll say you're not comfortable disclosing.  But given that no one else is seeing significant on-going sales in bitcoin I'm going to go ahead and say you are misinformed or attempting to misinform.  Even Gyft has stated that bitcoin sales are dropping.


If you are using a service that easily integrates with bitpay, or you run an online store that doesn't have an order management or payment flow system already.  So if you're a mom and pop shop without a proper shopping cart this is true.


Smaller for the merchant since they are just pushing the real fees onto their customers through the spread.  (Lowering the number of customers that will ever use it).


True and another reason why a lot of people won't ever feel comfortable shopping online with bitcoin.

A physical business where you buy a product you consume on site is about as far from a target for carding as you can get.  Carders want to make money from their carding not get a meal.  That is why things like electronics are big with them since they can resell them easily.  Something like this would be a dream since they can buy the money ship it out of the account and not have to worry about a physical delivery and the goods can't be cancelled or recovered.

Given the level is at anything over $4.50 I personally wouldn't consider every address a user even if they were uniquely owned.  I think the numbers above 0.1 would be closer to actual users.

Miners search for a hash that matches certain properties(determined by  the difficulty level).  Once they've found a hash that matches that they group it up with however many transactions they want build a block that references the last one they know about and includes the above number and send it out to their connected nodes which verify the hash and propagate it.  
As blocks get added onto the chain in this process they increase the confirmations(which is really just blocks on top of the one containing your transaction) since the more blocks away from the one containing the transaction the harder it would be to build an alternative chain of blocks that is longer.
How'd I do?

You're making it sound like you can't make fun of the nutty parts of the community while still making money from the markets.
Besides that almost no one has built much wealth at all from bitcoin.  Even if you got in early and kept 1000 coins you're up what 600K over 3 years.
But most people that got in early spent/lost their coins and the ones that got in late tended to gamble/'invest' and lose their coins.  Almost everyone here has less than 10 coins with a few 'whales' holding ~100.  None of them are getting rich though.

I'm not talking about that I'm talking about their in house systems.


The information I need to give out with most credit card purchases is the card number, expiry date and CVV code.  If I need a delivery or its a large purchase I will need an address.  That's no different than paying with bitcoin.  


So I have to research all companies I want to spend with across multiple sites and hope the reviews aren't faked(and if they are I'm out of luck).  Or pay higher fees to use escrow which the store almost certainly doesn't accept.


How many people lost out money in those hacks?  People here throw them around all the time but credit cards are meant to be replaceable and are insured against loss.  Having them be stolen is little more hassle than contacting your bank and letting them know.
I know plenty about bitcoin systems.  Unlike you though I can recognize that bitcoin isn't better for consumers than credit cards(hence almost all merchants seeing almost 0 usage).

You can tell this by their excitement at having $5000 worth of bitcoin(OMG 1 in a million club this is amazing!), which if bitcoin went to $50,000 per coin would only be worth $1m.  
If bitcoin actually looked like it was going to matter rich people are in a position to buy more coins than all of you even if they have to pay a premium over what you've paid it doesn't matter since moon right and holding BTC is the only important thing at that time.

Merchant adoption is a positive for people with bitcoin already.  No one* is waiting for a specific merchant to start accepting it before they buy since buying bitcoin just to spend at a specific store tends to not make sense(you end up paying more unless you get in one of the opening week sales or something).
Also popular merchants traditional lead to short term downward pressure as people use them as another method to cash out their bitcoin.  But that doesn't last too long as bitcoin sales fall off rapidly at all merchants.
*Well maybe one person

Yes, except when he releases figures we see that they are actually seeing a fairly rapid decline.


He also estimated that they would do $25m in bitcoin sales this year but half way through they hadn't even hit $2m and it was still dropping in daily volume.

But you haven't gotten to the point.  Where is the advantage in using bitcoin over a credit card for most users.  The advantage of buying online vs going to a store is obvious(pricing, ease, lazyness).  What are the features of bitcoin that you see making it more desirable for buyers?  The benefits for sellers are clear but thats only one half of the equation.

There is no demand from customers so payments are not going to have any effect on bitcoin.  Literally all the news is about places starting to accept it.  After that everyone is silent because no one is using it.  Look at overstock, tiger direct, gyft, etc and they get the most press from it.

Cold storage with occasional moves to hot storage is the smart move but it's also a pain in the ass to do safely so even if it's done it will probably be done insecurely(opening the cold storage on your regular computer/OS to transfer to your hot storage).

I was more referring to the fees getting money to the exchange in the first place.  I think exchange fees can easily be low enough to make it worthwhile but if you have to pay for a wiretransfer to deposit funds you need to be buying a lot to cover the difference.

Yes and sellers love it until no one uses it then they give up on it.


Yes, they've offloaded all the fees(now known as spread) and risk to the consumer.  That is one of the reasons demand is non-existent.  It doesn't offer benefits to users over existing systems.  It just pushes the costs on them and removes consumer protections.


I know.  That is why I said you're confusing the PoW stuff with the addresses.  SHA is used for the PoW only.  A break in it would allow people to mine blocks much easier than other miners it wouldn't allow them to take coins from peoples wallets or anything(well kind of, with much easier mining they could rewrite the chain fairly easily).


You're assuming banks aren't ridiculously profitable.  The expensive parts of banking is having branches for people to go to.  Bitcoin doesn't get rid of that need.  The actual moving of money is cheap for banks.  If you have a lot they will even do it for free for you.


They charge 10% because they have locations all over the place.  For bitcoin to compete it would need similar things and there is no indication that those locations would charge any less than WU.


Facebook has better chip designers than any mining company and the funds to produce much better miners than any of the current mining companies.  Retailers almost universally use 3rd parties like bitpay/coinbase/etc.  Facebook could easily pay these companies to start processing their coin too and they all would jump at the chance.  Suddenly all their retailers accept it now too.


The only trembling I see is your fellow users every time an altcoin is mentioned.  They seriously go off the rails in fear of any competition.


You don't though.  There has been very little growth in users over the past year outside of the bubble and that just ended up pushing a lot of people away.


So if I created an alt coin with cheaper transaction fees it would win?  Of course not because those fees aren't the most important thing unless they are completely unaffordable.

You need more than just computers for the internet.  You need infrastructure and backbone providers and interlink exchanges.  All things that will basically drop out when no one can afford to pay for them because the economy has completely collapsed.
I think you believe there are a lot more links than there actually are.  Most countries have a handful of international links run by one or maybe two countries.  It doesn't take much to cut a country off from usefulness.

TD Visa debit cards suck for online purchases in Canada since they use a different visa charge code in the payment request and for some reason almost no Canadian retailers support it.  Works fine internationally though where I believe it is treated just like a normal credit card.

I don't think something like it will succeed in payments.  I think it will always be viewed as tokens by the general population and people are amazingly resistant to buying tokens to make purchases online.
As for transferring wealth all the things that make other systems useful to a disconnected/unbanked world(local venders everywhere) are things that cost money and lead to markups.  There is very little need for people who do that to buy into bitcoin for those transfers when they could just use an internal ledger.
I think blockchain tech will be successful in other systems though.  I only have a very high level knowledge of namecoin but what I've seen looks interesting.   Bitmessage I'll have a read about now.  Bitauth/bitid I think will fail.

It's possible they've made the mistake everyone who talks about remittance being bitcoins killer app makes.  They assume the movement of value is the expensive part of the operation.

The transactions to itself are just change.  It is sending a bunch of what I assume are small payments each in their own transaction instead of grouping multiple ones in a single transaction as is the norm.  There have been a few systems doing this lately accounting for 10s of thousands of transactions per day on the days I've noticed them(they accounted for ~1/3rd to 1/2 the transactions on Friday for example) though those ones uses a new address for the change each time as well so this one is different but just as prolific with the transactions.

I'd rather deal with the inconvenience of having to wait for a new card than the disaster of having all my money stolen.  That is the difference between the cost of failure for the two technologies.
If they can take out a loan in your name with just the information from a normal credit card transaction then they can take it out in your name without that information just by looking at your name since you get the same amount of personal information.  A name.  The other information isn't required for a credit card transaction and would be just a likely to be required for a bitcoin transaction(address for example).

Looking into different cryptocoins


Investing in cryptocoin companies not bitcoin itself


One of their analysts created a report about bitcoin.  Whats your point?
Where has any of these people/companies recently said bitcoin isn't stagnating?

Then they can show their pay cheques.  No problem.
Seriously in almost every case where there was a seizure it was either a) the people lying about having the cash at a border or b) found in connection with another crime
Then because in most cases the money was actually proceeds of a crime/unreported income they go to the internet/news because they don't actually have a legitimate source for the money.
There are definitely a few cases(like that hwy patrol cop in the news recently) where shit was handled wrong but you won't find more than a handful.
@_date: 2014-11-28 22:02:35
Yes and whats your point?  Seriously you're just splitting hairs here trying to make an argument for something that doesn't make sense.
If its not large then its better for them to have it in something stable and in their control like physical cash.  If it is large they will be able to access banking.

It makes it useless because it only protects against other people acting rationally in relation to the money.  
If you can't protect against people who would hurt you just for the hell of it and take the financial hit or for someone who has a reason to attack you and is willing to pay to do so then you can't be certain any transaction won't fall into those buckets and therefore the protocol isn't safe to use.
Edit: replied to the wrong comment thread here!
The problem with that is by the time you get to a reasonable level there will be a great deal of bank transfer fees involved.  Wire transfer fees will make this difficult for smaller amounts(at $1000 for example it would cost me 3.5%).

You can send someone a billion dollars across the world with no fees with the traditional banking system too(seriously if you have a lot of money they don't charge you for anything).

How long would it take to cash out a billion dollars in bitcoin to USD?

You are right(just checked).  If they have a value over $10K then you have to fill out a form(same for cash).  Under that you're good to go.  When I've crossed though(and I cross in and out of the US very regularly) they generally specify cash when asking how much we have.

It's infeasible for anything covering a large distance like the world wide networks people here are talking about.  Even if you have 100% coverage the lack of trunking and the number of devices you'd have to pass through would make extremely high latency as well as congestion would make any access extremely low bandwidth.

Your problem is you hear the word mainframe and think legacy systems.
Mainframes excel at certain types of tasks.  That is why they are used for those tasks.  For the ones they aren't great at other systems are commonly used.
I worked at a bank over a decade ago with 3 or 4000 linux servers sitting in a data centre in NJ mostly unused since someone like you with just enough knowledge to be dangerous decided that distributed processing was the way to go!
They did end up building an awesome environment provisioning system on top of it though so it wasn't a total loss.

That explains why you think I don't understand multisig.  The trust I was referring to was not trust that they run off with your coins.
In that case you have to trust them to sign it or your coins are useless, you also have to trust them not to fuck up and sign when the transfer is over the limit.  Unless you have a copy of their key somewhere in which case the system is pointless since the villain can just demand you get your copy.  
"I don't have a copy"  
"then I'll kill you"  
"ooooh THAT copy"
Also with that system what happens when you need to make a large purchase?  Do you gradually move coins out of your wallet over a long period of time?  Or would they have to have a system to authorize larger transfers which again makes it exploitable.

Thats not true actually.  Most modern credit card processing it moving more to a pass through type system where the handling of the data is done remotely by a specialty company(see Stripe for example) with the merchant never having access to it or needing to deal with it.

I've been around on the internet a lot longer than most people and while I was never using 2400bps modems I remember a time when almost no one else had the internet.  Which again has nothing to do with its improvement over it's predecessors. 
The fact that their wasn't much data available or many people to use email with doesn't change the fact that functionally it was a huge leap over the existing solutions.
I keep seeing this argument over and over here like email or the web were useless before they were very popular.  They weren't.  They were less useful then they currently are because of the network effect but they were still a huge leap in productivity than the existing methods.
Bitcoin doesn't offer that same leap in functionality or productivity.  At the end of the day it is at best the same system with a different currency and at worst another middle step in the same system.
Bitcoin becomes as functional as the current offerings once you account for a massive network effect.  It doesn't improve on them dramatically at all.  Certainly not enough to convince most people to switch their life flow to incorporate it.

I just hope you're young enough to easily bounce back from your losses(and that you bought in early) and you learn the above lesson going forward.

You just said that the chance of getting screwed averages out.  But the fact that it exists is the problem.  In a perfectly rational world you're right it won't happen but we don't live in that world so it's something that needs to be accounted for.

I've been using the internet now for ~20 years.  The first 5 years spent focusing almost entirely on network security and programming, reverse engineering and crypto.  The next 15 spent working as a programmer on networked or internet related projects and a few stints operating very large clusters of servers distributed around the world.  I'm confident I have a pretty good grasp on the internet, networking in general and internet security.  You started with a 56K modem so you either started after me or you had access to advanced unreleased to the public technology.  You also have a poor memory for the past because by the time modems reached 56K connecting to an ISP was a piece of cake across the board.  You were maybe using windows 3.1 but you were behind the times since Windows 95 had been out for a while so maybe thats why you found it so difficult.  Who knows but to process was basically "create account, receive cd or floppy disk, insert, install isp software, open dialer, connect, open netscape(also on the cd or floppy) and be at the isp portal".  And that was just if you used a smaller regional ISP.
The internet wasn't competing against any of those since it was so vastly superior to all of them for data transmission even back at the beginning.  It started out better and improved.  Bitcoin is starting out worse in almost every way and at the best will improve to equal the existing technology.
As for the second point people need to be mindful for both PC security and ensuring they are careful with their privacy to ensure their bitcoin aren't stolen regularly.  People suck at both and no matter how many years we've spent improving technology to safeguard people there is one constant.   People will do really stupid shit regularly with their computers.  Now the cost is that they are part of the botnet or their credit card is stolen and they have to get a new one or they have a dozen toolbars in their browser.  If bitcoin became popular the cost would be a loss of all the money in their hotwallet regularly.  And since most people aren't thinking about the security of hot/cold wallets that means all their money.  That or we go back to centralized services for securing their wallets in which case you've just removed yet another benefit of bitcoin and replaced it with a requirement of the existing system.
@_date: 2014-07-26 14:34:29


It's not bad but the number of people that fit that in the bitcoin world is in the dozens and if you assume bitcoin will see the same growth it has but there is no guarantee of that nor is it even particularly likely.
Most people here haven't and won't make fuck all off bitcoin.  They spend all their time dreaming about being rich off a lucky bet on an asset instead of taking steps to get rich other ways so there really isn't anything to be jealous of them for.
Seriously if you have less than 1000 coins you aren't getting rich from bitcoin and if you do good luck trying to cash out.

Where have you heard that from?  Or rather which large established players?  And was that after the first week?  I think all bitcoin merchants that have any publicity see the same thing.  A huge first day.  Half second day then basically no volume after that.
If you calculate revenue per day for Overstock which has been the most forthcoming with numbers it's basically been a straight line down from launch over the course of 6 months.  I haven't run the numbers in a while since I haven't seen a new figure released from them in a long time but last time I checked they were at $5K/day revenue in bitcoin.
Here are the numbers for Overstock
[Jan 10 - 130K](    
Jan 11-29[same source as above] - $26K/day average (600,000-130,000)/18   
[Next 36 days to March 4th they do $400K]( - $11K/day average  
[Next 83 days to May 27th they do $600K]( - $7200/day average

The DoD announced that their financial reporting systems couldn't be integrated making it difficult to track that much at an overall level but that it was all tracked at a departmental level.

People that think this either don't know how most people do remittance or think people in the other countries want bitcoin for some reason(they don't).  People doing this would still have to find buyers for bitcoin in the foreign country and since it will be a buyers market they will almost certainly pay a higher premium than western union to send money in the end.  "But they won't need to sell it you say" And to that I say bollocks.

Both good answers.  Thank you.
For 1 how do you convert the money to bitcoin and back while avoiding the traditional money transfer fees or a similar issue(markups in lbc) though?  I think thats a hard problem but I could definitely be wrong.

Thats not similar at all.  The web is easier that the alternative.  The matter of content doesn't matter.  The number of webpages available isn't what made the web better than the existing methods(hoping your local library had or could order the documents you needed, trolling through dozens of books finding important bits, etc) it just made it better for more things.
Bitcoin isn't better than the traditional methods for most people and the process to acquire it actually makes it worse since you're generally still using the existing methods you're just adding the additional step of bitcoin in the middle.

That would be a silly argument to make though so you shouldn't do that.
A few billion in bitcoin isn't liquid even at $50k per coin.
Billionaires have access to 0%-near 0% loans against their assets.  Zucks mortgage was 0%.  Larry Ellison is famous for being like the 3rd richest man at one point and having his accountant complaining about his overspending which was all done on loans against his assets.  Also zuck could setup something like Bill Gates and have it automatically sell X hundred thousand shares a week and have liquidity very easily from his paper money.

Thats a bit of a leap in the headline.  Typical from coindesk.
Someone at mastercard filed a patent for a payment system(its what researchers at mastercard should be doing).  In it they mention bitcoin 4 times.  Basically saying they want to create a shopping card that can accept all forms of payment(patients need to be as broad as possible without being too broad to be useful).  They added literally every payment method the researcher could think of.  Heres the list: 






Unless you have any indication they are planning this then you're once again making shit up coindesk or you don't understand how many patients major corps file.  Its cheap for them so they file them for every idea if they plan to implement them or not.

Bitcoin sounds great for remittance but what you're forgetting is it will be the same people on the other side handing out the cash in exchange for bitcoin and there is no incentive for them to charge less for that service than the existing ones.  The cost of getting cash on the other side is what you're paying for not the transferring of value.

It signifies no such thing.  It signifies that 2 million wallets were created.  We know nothing about how many users created them, how many were used, how many are still used, etc.




Again no it doesn't.  It shows lots of accounts being created.  There is a reason unsuccessful sites use that metric and successful ones switch to the active users per month one.  It's because the first exists only to make you look bigger than you are and gives the impression of continuous growth even when your user base is shrinking. Once you are actually successful and showing growth the second is more trusted and more valuable.

Do you have examples of how getting access to your online banking would allow this?  All the credit options require signatures with every bank I've been with.
The common ways for identity theft don't involve breaking into or stealing anything.  If a service will allow someone to open an account with just the details they'd get from your online banking or credit card transaction they will let you open them with details you'd get from your mailbox or the phone book.


Sure its easy!  Step one have a spare computer that you will never use online.  Step 2 install an OS that most people will have difficulty using(Yes, Ubuntu is great.  It will still be a steep learning curve for most people even just to do this with it).
Step 3.  Realize your security still isn't guaranteed after those ridiculous steps.

What are you talking about?  The charts show no growth over the past year.  That includes the last run up.  Like transaction volume is the same before the run up as it is now.  0 growth.
Or we can focus on the number of addresses with coins in them which is still tiny and not growing.
No instead lets focus on the stuff we can't know because coinbase and bitpay have all stopped reporting(no doubt due to shit numbers).  Offchain transactions.  Yes apparently all the growth in bitcoin is happening off chain.  Which is confusing since you said people care about the open nature of it.

That was an interesting rant about how phone cards rapidly change value entirely based in your imagination.  Do deals and new companies come along with cheaper cards?  Sure.  Does it happen frequently enough that it would be a concern?  No.


Well I didn't say 25% in a single day.  It went from what 350-&gt;450-&gt;360 in a week.  My numbers weren't exact but you should have figured that out by the use of 50 and 25.  I can't believe I'm having to explain estimation to you.


Because the person you sell those to will almost certainly be an international trader or be one step away from one and they will care so if you get 7% less for them you're fucked when you have to go buy your replacement stock.


Or you know they might not since they then have to find someone to buy it from them and it will be a buyers market if you have an influx of bitcoin into a poor area due to remittance.

Bitpay is a middle man.  They won't because to get to twitters revenue bitcoin would have to outgrow them.  For them to be doing twitters revenue they would have to be processing 100b in transactions per year.
If there was that much moving around then companies wouldn't need to convert it back to their local currency so the need for paying 1% to companies like bitpay to handle that for them would go away.

1) Because paying a small fee spread across lots of people to ensure 0 risk is better than saving a tiny fee with a risk to total failure.


Why do you believe this?  The fraud against stores would likely drop but the fraud against consumers would go up a lot.
You're not getting rid of the fraud you're just removing consumer protections and moving the risk to the consumer side.
2) Thats a good point I cannot predict what the volatility will be but I don't have to.  There will always be volatility between currencies.  And companies dealing across currencies learn very quickly to hedge against that volatility.  It works but it costs money that they pass onto the consumer.

2. Give them my bank account details and the ability to debit my bank account
3. Wait for authentication(how long does this take?)  
4. Place order, wait for them to debit my account and provide coins(how long does this take?)
5. Pay with bitcoin!
Yes I can see how that could be seen as much easier and faster than paypal.

Ya they definitely aren't going to lose money on having to have someone either trading in bitcoin on the changes or exchange fees doing something like that.  It's definitely just going to be the transfer fee that they have to deal with.
Plus the need to pay a bit more as well to cover the withdraw fees for those employees who don't want to be paid in bitcoin.
If you have fiat on one side and you need fiat on the other side bitcoin won't actually save you money on the transfer because the cost to acquire and offload it is higher than the alternative.

But its not growth and when all the demand is concentrated in the existing userbase eventually it will wane.
If stocks or gold had less than 1m users and it wasn't growing then I could see your point being valid but as it is the number of bitcoin users is tiny and easily outnumbered by a new solution with appropriate backing.  Why do you think real big money is going to pump your investment up when they can create a new product of their own?

My point was that to stop people from robbing them you have to invest in security.  That makes your service more expensive to operate than free.


First up you would have to have probably 30,000 people in walking distance from your house with relatives within walking distance of your friends house to do 1000 a day since most people won't be sending more than once a month.  Also you will have to go to the bank since you'll have to be giving the people cash.

Or:  
1.  You have multiple accounts linked to your account for cash flow and this is the main operating account
2.  The business is a remittance business with high levels of cash flowing through it but not much held in it
3.  He lied about the $3K thing thinking it would be a brag not make him look like an idiot
I mean that's at least 4 possibilities only one of which points to it being his personal account.
That said even if it is his personal account by the time you're spending 3k a month on fees on your business account you get your branch manager to sort out your fees on your personal accounts too.

If I want to buy something with bitcoin I have to first buy them.  I can either pay a premium on coinbase or localbitcoins or I can go through the process of transferring money to an exchange and buying them there.  In the future maybe I get paid in bitcoin but then I have to go through the process of selling my bitcoin at some point for cash so I can pay my taxes and buy stuff that isn't available with bitcoin(most utilities probably won't change to bitcoin) so I'm probably not going to bother with that.
Thats enough to lose most people since the premiums above are higher than their costs using traditional means.  But assuming it's not...
I then go and buy something and I lose my customer protection and most likely a points system that runs across all purchases from all stores.
I understand those are including in the credit card fees but for 1% I get risk free buying.
I now also need to worry about security of my computer which if I'm most users I suck at really badly or trust my coins to someone else in which case I am better off storing my money at a traditional bank with proper insurance.
So tell me again how that is better than traditional finance by the difference between normal mail and email.

By making them illegal they don't need to block the actual transfers they just need to give themselves the right to fine or arrest anyone participating in a transaction and you will be able to effectively silence the usage of it by pushing it underground.  When you make the use of bitcoin illegal it only makes sense to use it for illegal purchases.
@_date: 2014-07-27 06:55:01
I disagree.  Bitcoin is held up by the belief of its users in its value.  Something like that would crush that belief and drive most of the users away.
It probably wouldn't but it would be a shell of its former self and no longer relevant to the world.  I don't see bitcoin every disappearing completely no matter what happens because a lot of people are emotionally attached to it.
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:09:36
They already had facebook credits I believe they got rid of it due to lack of demand(a problem bitcoin is facing as well with its lack of consumer uptake) but if demand started up again they could just bring it back very easily.  Its not like they have to pay anything that other exchanges wouldn't the only difference is they would be starting with a userbase that is over 1300x the size of the most optimistic bitcoin user numbers.

Your posts are getting more and more desperate with the hours of the day.  Maybe you should take a break.  You've already made a lot of money off bitcoin right?

The miners are the infrastructure of bitcoin.  All the exchanges and "bitcoin companies" are built to easily swap out cryptocurrencies.  Also why do you think all the users would be willing to do something that instantly removes all the mining power?
Do you think the bitcoin network with no mining power is going to have any value?  The miners provide the security that allows for the valuation.  No miners no value.

While I think the $2b person was wrong you read what they said wrong as well.  They didn't say you need $2b to start up they said a proper exchange would be valued at $2b.
A few million is pretty reasonable though.  $50K isn't.  You're going to need a few things to get started which are very expensive.  You're going to need a few financial experts, a team of programmers with a finance background and a team of lawyers.  Thats just to get started then on top of that once you're going to need to pay for and get all the correct licensing which is where the $2 million figure you're seeing up top is coming from.

Some do but most don't because of the cost of securely storing them and passing the audits.  Also if your card has a pin number the merchant definitely doesn't keep it on file as they are never actually given it.
Their customers got sent new cards with no financial loss so I'd say it worked out pretty well for them given the situation.  
If you're going to go there though then how did those "insert just about any exchange" customers end up when they had their security breach?  Or all the people who have had their wallets emptied through having their computer hacked/malware being installed?

You can have great security with bitcoin if you are perfect at internet security.  But that is very rare and definitely not the case for any general user.  I can have great security with cash if I have a giant vault of my own.


Demand isn't really going up though, the price is being maintained by current users tossing their money in.  There is pretty much no growth in addresses, transactions or any metric that indicates end users over the past year.  There is a lot of things that point to it shrinking though(number of companies that accept it that see near 0 usage, the big payment companies coinbase and bitpay deciding to stop announcing transaction numbers, etc)

It's difficult to impossible to penetrate policy in places like that though which is what you're ignoring.  Apple have a good thing for them in the app store and they know virtually every app maker wants in so they can be very picky about what they allow and when they set a policy they stick to it.  A lot of apps have been screwed over by this and gotten lots of publicity everywhere only to have nothing change.  


Multi-sig wouldn't work for automated payments which is what that was about since they'd need to be able to process the payment automatically otherwise it's just a calendar entry to remind you every month in which case might as well just avoid the multi-sig.

If this is the bottom layer then it is pointless because everyone will want the layer on top which requires the middle man.  
Paying once for unlimited ads until someone else comes along is a bad plan for the publisher and possibly the advertiser since there is no lower threshold on views/clicks.  Most ad networks have fairly low fill rates as it is.  This one would have almost 0 fill rate so the first person to pay any amount is likely to stay the advertiser on your site until you stopped using the code.
For the advertisers it would be impossible to calculate required spend.
You also need sales teams to get advertisers on board most people doing the ad spend are not technical and will not find something like this.

The numbers they are releasing are odd though.  They said they did ~$300K in the first day and it took them over a month to pass $1 million so that says the $20-30K per day they are quoting is either an average over the first month and very heavily weighted to the start of the month or suddenly their bitcoin traffic has spiked again.  I bet if we could see a graph it would have spikes at the start and when they announced they were nearing $1 million.  They seem to release a new press release about bitcoin every other day now so I'm sure that helps as well but I doubt they are hitting new customers anymore.

Convenience:  Minimal miner fees are also a limited time proposition and it's a pain to load up your wallet but you're right that once it's there if you can find a store it's generally easy.
Accessibility:  Then they have to pay to convert it back to cash.  I hope you paid them extra to cover those fees.

Are they though?  Who are the people in Tito and Mufasa's home countries that are interesting in buying bitcoin and why?


They do and that is the problem.  If I have 1btc today and I want to buy something from a store that is 1btc I have to do it now since an hour from now it could be 1.1btc.  The odds of a store working in your local currency changing prices that much is very low(I'm pretty sure Walmart probably optimizes their prices better than anyone and you can still expect the same prices for many many days on end).

Depends where you are.  In countries with strong debit networks it is generally cheaper to use that online.  And once you include the cost to acquire and sell bitcoin it often is about the same price as traditional methods(more if you're sending to a small market).


You're confusing the likelyhood of being able to bruteforce one of bitcoin keys with the ability to attack SHA.  Hashing algorithms fall fairly regularly though total failure is rare.


Mining is in essence bruteforcing SHA-256(SHA-256) only not looking for an exact match but one that matches characteristics.  You're confusing the addresses with the PoW stuff here.


Unless the banks drop their prices in which case they will win by default of already having all the buy in.


Exactly and the bitcoin network is tiny.  Like &lt;1m people tiny.  Like Facebook could release facebookcoin tomorrow and have more than that signed up by lunch.
Compared to existing banking systems it is pretty much non-existent in size.


Which is why you won't get people moving over from traditional banking.  For almost every use case and everyone used day to day traditional banking is good enough.
@_date: 2014-03-21 00:28:10
True, but convincing them to get over the next hurdle of actually acquiring more is the bigger leap and IMHO the more important one since just giving yours away isn't actually expanding the market anymore than if you were to just buy something with them yourself.  It's definitely a nice thought though and will probably get them at least thinking about it.

I like cryptocurrencies.  I find them fascinating as a topic.  That said a lot of people here have vested interests in only saying or reading positive reinforcements of bitcoin because of their personal investment in it(often their only investment and by far their largest).  That leads to a lot of false information and the occasional lie being spread.  When I post here it's usually pointing out flaws in those comments and trying to get people to think about the serious issues facing widespread adoption.  
So I like the concept of bitcoin/the technology.  I hate the zealous/fanatical parts of the community that will attack anyone/thing that isn't positive about it by basically covering their ears and shouting lalala.

What fees?  Certainly not exchange fees.  That is if you can even find an exchange that would service your home town in these countries.
Sending bitcoin is the easy part(though you will pay a premium to buy it via local bitcoins/atm of probably 5%).  It is what to do with it on the other side where people will get monumentally ripped off and why it will cost more than existing remittance services.
That is what you seem to be missing.  The bitcoin doesn't just magically maintain value across borders you need to find a local person to buy it from you at that value and in a buyers market they can make the spread whatever they want.
@_date: 2014-04-06 18:17:59
The problem I see with bitcoin and I've posted this earlier is that back then everyone had thousands of ideas for how the internet could improve our lives and their ideas were improvements even if they couldn't be implemented at the time.

If you're doing &gt;$1000 in your billing cycle just have them wire it to you and offer to pay the fee.  It will work out to &lt;3% and you'll do better than with credit cards.  If you're less than that credit cards are probably your cheapest.  You could also look at ACH which is dirt cheap.

I'd say when used properly with good actors on both sides of the transaction you're right.  But a mistake from the vendor side is all it takes for one side to be a bad actor and that happens a lot.


I think you have a lot more faith in the regular user doing the right/proper thing here than I do.


Losses from CC fraud fall to the vendor not the credit card company.  Another reason bitcoin is so rapidly adopted by merchants.  But it doesn't help consumers at all either way.

Apple isn't charging you the merchant is charging you as normal.
You add your card, Apple sends it to your credit card company or bank and gets a token.  Then when you want to buy something they use that token to generate a one time use card number which they send the merchant who then charges it as normal.  The bank knows that one time use number is associated with your card and adds it to your balance.

It's almost like accepting credit cards is more of a liability than just the 3% transaction fee.....

Thank you.  Now for the corrections.
They don't make money off people that buy high and sell low.  They don't hold positions for long enough.  They make money off the spread between the two.  If they can't sell them fast enough they won't buy them so when you are selling to coinbase you really are just selling to another end user with coinbase in the middle facilitating it.
Not that you should feel bad about selling at a profit but you should realize that there is definitely someone on the other side of that deal that is stuck having paid more than they are worth now.

The internet doesn't magically deliver cash to locals.  Your example has nothing to do with remittance.

In 2000 Paypal had 12,000 user accounts.

18 months after that they were at 12.8m users include 2.6m business accounts(at this point after 2 years they were handling about 189K transactions per day average).

Given the low number of sales they are making I don't think you have to worry about them flooding the market.  They are making ~10btc a day assuming they've stayed consistent over the past 3 months.  Given the trend line though I would be surprised if it was still over 6btc a day.


Their lack of success with bitcoin does though.  This was the flagship retailer for bitcoin for this year.  This was the big one and they are constantly promoted and talked about as that and they are doing almost nothing in sales.  if you're another business you're going to look at that negatively.

Some people probably do for sure.  It would take 5 minutes to write a script to crank out blockchain wallets and considering how many people use it as an indicator of success I wouldn't be surprised if at least a few people have done it already.  But what I was saying was actually that people create multiple wallets on those sites all the time even for normal usage.

1) You haven't explained how credit cards actually increase the likely hood of identity theft though unless you're including stolen credit cards in that category.
2) The vendor has to use the bitcoin once they receive it and will have to pay a fee and a spread on that so it ends up being built into the price.  It's there it is just hidden.
3) Or they could just see that no one else in their niche is taking a lowered return and stick with not giving a discount.  Some places give cash discounts, many don't.  The ones that do largely aren't doing it because they want to save money on credit card fees it's because they want to keep the sales off the books.  Bitcoin stops that anyhow.

1.  For most transactions all it does is add another 2 steps(buying bitcoin, selling bitcoin) and the associated costs without any real advantage  
2.  For transactions it shifts all risk and costs to the consumer
3.  Even people that are good with computers regularly screw up basic computer security issues and lose their coins.  Almost everyone is not good with computers.   
4.  A lot of the community is off putting to the general public.  
5.  Scalability.  Everyone says it will cause no problems based off of one wiki that kind of glosses over things  
6.  Most people involved are involved to get rich on a bubble and don't care about the network or technology.  When/if it becomes apparent that isn't going to happen a lot of them will leave  
7.  Lack of development.  There are all sorts of cool things going on with altcoins at the moment and everyone talks about how the better features will just be co-opted by bitcoin which will keep it in the lead but none of them are being implemented back into bitcoin so its falling behind on functionality even if it does still have the largest marketcap
8.  10 minutes for confirmation is fine for a merchant since everything they do except cash have long confirmation periods but when you're trying to pay a friend or make a person to person transfer it is way too long.

I personally don't think it is.  I was outlining the downsides to a global level economic crash of the dollar.
The second part isn't true.  The value in bitcoin depends on everyone being on the same block chain and it being communicated between them.  Drop that and it loses all its value.  You can't make regular transactions if you have to trust that the transaction is right until the next time you can get access to another network with the blockchain on it.

But thats not what is being recommended which is why the separate security step is needed.
The loss of the coinbase funds is acceptable though since it's a hot wallet so it should only have what you are comfortable losing in it.
Almost no one will do any of these steps to use bitcoin.  Most people will keep all their money in a hot wallet and do all transactions from compromisable machines.  My point was just that if you're going to do some of the actions of being secure which are above what most people are going to do you might as well just go all the way since a false sense of security is worse than no security(you're more likely to increase your risk threshold if you think you're secure).

I could bid on 50 coins at a bit below market and 1000 and 1/10th of market hoping my low bid fills in a winning order block and I get a bunch for really cheap but ultimately I'm only making a serious bid in the amount of 150coins.

I understand it fine.  I understood it fine the last 2 times it was posted here as well.
The fact that you need to put twice as much as the product costs in to the escrow(and have twice as much in bitcoin to do so) is a basic problem that excludes it from a lot of transactions for a lot of people outside of small things.  It also makes it difficult for venders since they will require a matching amount of bitcoin to their product to perform sales.  Having a chunk of money sitting around waiting to be used for escrow is about the worst use for it for a retailer.
Here's an example of an easy way to abuse this system as a vendor.
Say you offer to buy an xbox from me that I'm advertising as new.  You put up your 2 bitcoins, I put up mine and ship you a used one.  You say "WTF this isn't what I ordered" and I say ya mistake in the description and it now becomes a stand off.  Either you lose double for an inferior product or you accept the scam, pay full price and release the transaction.  Thats always going to be in the dealers favour so they just need to wait you out.

If some 3rd party loses your card details you have to wait for a new one.  It's a hassle but rarely a life changing event and it's rare.
Credit cards charge ~2-3% and I get the ability to preform charge backs, 1% cash back, and travel bonus(insurance coverage).
They can definitely overcharge you with bitcoin.  They just have to send you a worse product than the one you paid for and they've over charged you.  They can also just not send you the product at all.


Because charge backs exist and most companies are very careful to avoid situations where they would happen.  They are working to limit the exploitation of you.  If they were a regular thing it would be clear they weren't working.

No I would cut my losses.  I don't see how you read anything different from that.
The buyer could definitely put their foot down but it won't make sense financially.
You basically just ignored the whole argument on the basis that you think more people are going to pay double to fight the good fight instead of cutting their losses.  I think thats seriously flawed.


Yes it is MAD but it's not how it's likely to work unless the customer is a fanatic.
The scammer doesn't have to give up to get all of their money(the customer payment + their bond) in almost all cases.  Simply because it makes more sense for the customer to just cut their losses.
Because the customer has paid double for an inferior product in my example.  They can wait it out but at the end of the day they will have to pay twice for something worse instead of once.
I've outlined pretty clearly why I think it's likely to happen.  You have a rosy righteous world view where everyone is willing to fuck themselves over to get back at a scammer.  Given the choice between accepting a used xbox at full price and accepting a used xbox at double the price just to get back at the seller the number of people to pick the second option is going to be tiny.

The credit card company or bank provides them with the single use card number that is sent to the merchant.  That is how the bank/cc company knows how much has gone through Applepay without Applepay having to be in the middle of the transaction.

Most people here have &lt;10 coins.  They won't be rich for a very long time if ever with bitcoin since grow is slowing/stagnating.
Look at the number of people using it for commerce or value transfers.  It's not growing over the past few years.  Everyone is just sitting around now calling it a store of wealth but that requires people to constantly be buying in.

Why do bitcoin people also go with the email argument?  Email was always a huge improvement on the existing process.  Just because it wasn't as widely used doesn't mean it wasn't a better solution.  Are you saying that your method is a huge improvement on the existing solution?  Of course not, you've even admitted as much.  You're using the same process as you're trying to replace you're just adding a step in the middle.  If email involved writing a letter and putting it in a post box then having the postal service scan it transfer it to their other location and then have that location print it out and deliver it then you'd have a point.  Email removed the middle men it didn't just shift them to a different step.
I'm not saying people won't do it.  You're proof of that.  I'm saying it's going to be a minority of people that do it so as it picks up steam and people start using it more for the most part those will be people not replenishing their supplies.

Yes and regulation against the buying and selling of it would affect those forms of trade in it as well so you're not avoiding it at all you're just removing a medium from the trade.  Thats assuming you could build a closed loop in btc which you can't because of a number of core services(tier 1 internet providers, mining, energy companies, etc) that require government interaction to work and everyones taxes.  So converting to fiat will be required at multiple points in the system.

He would have to sell at a very steep discount for such highly visible coins so it wouldn't need to be near 500 million to make it worth it.  Plus it's a very large amount of money to be moved which increases the risk of the buyer getting caught since it's so visible.

Lots of merchants are trying it and a lot are ending up giving up because there is no demand.  Its free for them to try and may lower fees so of course they try it.


You're in an echo chamber where the only stories that get upvoted here are positive ones.  And half the time its not even the media it is their blog aggregator linking to some random 3rd party.  Of course you think the media is largely positive but you're wrong.  There is also the continued distrust and ridicule from the general public.  Go read the comments anywhere outside of and bitcointalk where bitcoin is mentioned.


Mining can still be profitable.  I'm not sure what that is suppose to prove?


Bullshit.  There has been no real increase in security that is accessible to the general public.  Best practises for using bitcoin still involve a separate computer that you never use for anything else.


I don't really see where you thought there was a lack of legitimacy unless you mean unregulation.  But all regulation takes time.
I notice you left off the increase in consumer demand, increase in number of users, or increase in transactions.  Because there is none and even you can't pretend there is.

Using bitcoin what is the cheapest method to go from cash in hand to cash in hash that doesn't involve a bank transfer?
1) Bitcoin ATM assuming you both live near one which you probably don't.  But if you do each side will likely charge you a minimum of 5-8%.  Making it more expensive than this.
2) LBC - Go look on LBC at the markups on both ends(unless your other side is willing to put up a seller ad and hope someone in their area wants to buy they will be dealing with buy ads) it would easily be over 15% in most markets once you account for the buy and the sell and involves making a deal with some random and either meeting up with them on the street or going and doing a deposit at their bank.
Then look at the WU service which allows you to walk into just about any convenience store/cheque casher hand them money and have the other end do the same and get money put in their hand.

Unless you stop accepting credit cards completely then it won't mean less fraud.  Customers that want to defraud you will just use credit cards and you'd have to have a death wish as a merchant to give up credit card acceptance entirely.

Which country?  You're misunderstanding the not being forced to do something against yourself.  The government(in the US) can't force you to turn over encryption keys that could be used to incriminate yourself.  They can force you to hand over control of property though and hold you in contempt if they determine you're lying about not having access.

Visa Debit cards don't require applications just a bank account, prepaid credit cards require neither.


Or more likely better margins for companies


How do you figure below market exchange rates?  Each side is going to be paying minimum of a couple percent to buy/sell btc.  Thats two currency exchange transactions plus the instability in the currency of exchange.


All credit cards are protected against this.  Though if your wallet details are compromised all your bitcoin can be taken with you unable to do anything about it.


Again credit cards have an easy method to counter this(charge backs)


Yup though the use case for this is basically drugs and other illegal activities.

Gay Marriage


Now, gays can have lovers and do whatever the hell they want, but they can't call their relationship a marriage because the word has a meaning.
Comfort women


As for the comfort women, I have still seen no reliable evidence they were "kidnapped" or taken as "slaves". It was a regulated system of brothels. And if Korean women working voluntarily in brothels was such a tragedy, why is prostitution one of the biggest industries in Korea today, with more than 16x as many women as are estimated to have been in the WWII brothel system?

How is bitcoin beneficial to the middle class?  The possibly rich(early adopters were almost all well off technical types) were already very well off.  The poor can't afford the speculative bet at this point.  And the ones that do are scared enough with the value that they tend to sell out on the down swings losing out.

It doesn't matter if the per transaction is free if it costs you 5% to get the coins in the first place then your transaction fee is minimum 5% on all transactions in that reload.

Yes, but they will demand a steep discount.  Which I would be surprised if he got 10% value for them if he did steal them and tried to launder them.  Even laundering normal currency takes a huge cut let alone one that is this easily trackable by a horde of rabid users/victims.


Why would you assume a company would sell for less than 6 months revenue?  The 500 million isn't a real number it doesn't matter because if he stole it he'd never be able to realize that value.  So it's not worth discussing.


Was it?  It went into serious decline when they started to deny/delay withdrawals the second time around before that they were still doing fine.  It would take an idiot to commit this crime from his position not a genius.  It takes someone like yourself who is ignoring the difficulty in realizing the value for it to sound like it would be worth it.  Thats not a criminal genius move.

It's the same with Canadian banks and Australian ones.  I'm guessing your bank just sucks.
Which brings us back to there is no central organization which will protect you from fraud.
Identity fraud is a problem when companies store details about you that can be used for financial transactions and allow for financial transactions without appropriate confirmation of details.  In the US for example that would be SSN, in Canada SIN, etc.  Using bitcoin over Visa isn't going to change that though since the most likely attack vectors(personal wallets and stores accepting visa) aren't going to have those details.
You're creating a false problem but you're not answering the question which is asking for reasons why your new way is better.  If all you can do is say "The old way is bad!" or making up ridiculous straw men "If visa was hacked" then you're not going to win.

I'm going to drop the numbers I think we've long since moved past their use in this thread. :)
Your calculation is ignoring the markup/spread on the exchange between US price and Bitcoin price that all retailers will do(and bitpay/coinbase/etc do automatically for them).  If you want to go ignore those markups than the credit card is always free for the customer.


There is no method of recovering your funds if the seller screws up and sends the wrong thing, sends a worse thing, doesn't send anything, provides a worse service than promised, etc.  Which is far more common in my experience than actual stolen credit card fraud.


It would drop to 0 for vendors but increase for consumers.


I don't believe this to be true.  I think merchant adoption is growing fantastically and far outpacing consumer adoption.  I think that is because almost all of the benefits in a bitcoin transaction are on the vendor side and all the risk is on the consumer side.

@_date: 2014-09-20 17:42:15
Once you account for the cost to buy it quickly and the spread bitpay and coinbase put on every purchase they would have to do a lot more than 2% better to make it worth while for me to spend the time to get it in the first place unless it was something that I was paying &gt;$30K for.  (And considering the markups on LBC if I couldn't use Coinbase or Circle they would have to do better than 5-10% in most cases just to break even).

The reason the price drops is because more people want to sell than want to buy so they are competing with each other to sell so they keep offering their coins for lower.  Eventually someone comes along and buys some and that sets the new price.

Then you should talk to them more because it appears you have a huge misunderstanding about how it all works and their 'partnership'.  And the technology involved.


First up why would they pick stripe instead of coinbase or bitpay?
Secondly it doesn't work like that, applepay isn't a traditional wallet that stores things.  It stores references to things.   It doesn't pay with new protocols it is paying using credit cards/debit cards(one time cards) which merchants already need merchant accounts for.  So as far as the merchant system is concerned its the same process as always they receive the card details and they ship it off to their merchant bank who ships it off to visa/mc/etc and pays them.
The only way bitcoin fits into that is through something like Xapo which exposes and CC interface to your bitcoins.

Fair enough


It's inherent to escrow without a controlling arbitrator.  Almost every multisig escrow system I've seen proposed has basically been the same thing.  Maybe I missed one though so please correct me if thats true.
Both parties attach X coins to a transaction that requires them both to sign to release it and the buyer adds the cost of the item in there.  The seller sends the item and if its all good the buyer signs and gets their X amount back and the seller gets the payment and their X amount back.
Heres the thing. I am the scammer I offer to sell you a brand new XBoxOne.  We both put $250 worth for X and you add in $250 for the payment.  I send you a used XBoxOne.  You say "This is bullshit I'm not paying."  I say "Sorry tough luck".  You now have two options.  You apy $500 for your used XBoxOne.  Or you bite the bullet, sign the transaction, get your $250(X) back and end up paying full price for a used one.  Some people will fight back and refuse to sign the transaction and leave their money tied up but I guarantee its few enough willing to lose out like that to make it profitable for the scammer.

1) And that risk that comes from those types of fraud is insured against.  Compare that to exchanges being hacked or peoples computers being hacked.
2) Then they would have to price the volatility in on their end as well or else they risk losing money on transactions.  Either way it is priced in and hidden from you.  Use the bitstamp market rate to convert each time you buy something with bitcoin to see what I'm talking about.
Edit: forgot 3.
3) It's possible that they could.  But they would have to offset by more than their savings vs using credit cards to convince customers to switch so few will actually do it.  A 2-3% savings isn't going to cut it for people already getting 1% back on all their transactions regardless of the vendors decision.

But you won't be rich or wealthy you will just be less poor.  Your $112 investment is now worth $640.  So in 9 months you have made ~$530.

If it goes up 100x you will have $64000.  That seems like a lot to you but it is very far from it.
Now if it looks like its going to take off for real someone with lots of money can afford to buy a lot more at a higher price and still do better than you.

For the seller.  What about for the buyer?  Almost the merchants in the world could impliment bitcoin as a payment service and all it would do would drive everyone to the remaining credit card services because there isn't any real advantages to using bitcoin for consumers in legitimate purchases.  Thats what I asked for.  So far you've given me a bunch of reasons it's good for sellers.  Why is it good for buyers.


Inflation isn't always a bad thing if you're spending your currency.  For one thing it discourages hoarding.


There are escrow services today and once bitcoin gets popular do you really think the governments will not regulate companies dealing with it?  We're already seeing that today.


When I pay with my credit card the transaction time is in seconds.


For now


If I buy something from you and you don't send me the product you've just cheated your system.


But people can steal all of Targets bitcoins and there is no recurse for them.  People can steal individuals wallets and there is no way for them to recover those funds.  With credit cards the buyer is protected from those losses.  Thats not an advantage for a buyer.

Yes, they want individuals as customers because they can turn around and say to investors "Look how many users we have" while trying to figure out a way to be profitable.

They are selling shovels.  Shovels that will work with whatever cryptocurrency eventually wins out above all the rest.  It's not really an indication of the success of bitcoin so much as the interest of crypto currencies and the existence of a market to exploit.


Not quite.  It's peoples beliefs that they are worth X amount that makes them worth that much.  The time/energy/computing power is required but it's not what gives it the value.  People like yourself saying "I will pay $480 for a bitcoin" is what makes it worth $480.
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:08:08
People who are not eligible for credit cards can get prepaid ones at the less cost than acquiring bitcoin or use a visa debit card.
Paypal isn't the only alternative.
Western Union is pretty cheap for values &gt;$100.  And dirt cheap if you're willing to wait 3 days.  Cheaper than most bitcoin options.
Overseas wire transfers generally aren't that long of a process and if you have to acquire bitcoin anyhow then the process is the same since you still have to send your money overseas to an exchange.
What possibilities?  Where does it honestly excel?
You know people that use to say that?  They didn't just say "This is great I only have to wait until my girlfriend is off the phone to access mail that I use to only get once every couple of days".  Or did you just make that complaint up?
You assume a lot about time and knowledge in these posts.  I can assure you I've been aware of bitcoin for a lot longer than 6 months.  I've been aware of it for a few years now and I still haven't seen a convincing answer to any of the above other than "Future magic!"

I'm also right about the taxable benefits.

Upon what do you base that?


Are you saying you think their expenses were high?  It's an exchange it's the definition of high margin.  It's not rocket science to build the exchange but it's less risk to buy an already successful one.  It had certainly not been in decline for years.  There was more competition but it was still a leader by far.


Yes really.  At some point real money has to be exchanged so it's either done in person or through an exchange with id and with enough people watching the trades eventually your going to sell to someone who wants to track you or to someone who will give you up.  Also it's easy to do with 100 coins.  It's not easy to do with 8000 times that many coins.  You can't sell them all off in small transactions it will take more time than it's worth.

They had insurance so their depositors didn't lose money.
Bitcoin takes all the security responsibility currently with centrally insured and well protected institutions.  And places them it in your hands.  That is why it isn't secure.

It hasn't worked out that well for it though.  The CEO is just a nutter and now that hes bought in fully he can't change direction so they have to keep doing stupid shit like this to try and get bitcoin holders to remember they exist and spend money there.  
He announced on May 27th they'd done $1.6m in bitcoin sales.  They announced on March 4th they had hit $1m.  So from March to May inclusive they averaged $200K per month in sales(not profits).  That means assuming this initiative is on sales they will be donating around $6000/month for something.  If its on profits it'd be around $300/month.

You've never worked with a large product have you?  Overstock had to have 50 people working for a week to implement it.  Not because they are stupid but because implementing a new payment system in a large code base is never as simple as people like yourself think.  Overstock almost certainly hasn't saved more than they spent yet given their sales numbers.
They aren't looking for profit from bitcoin they are looking for a bunch of free press.  It will pay off like that but I doubt they get enough bitcoin payments in the first 6 months to pay for the development.


Unless you have a developer dedicated to maintaining the new payment system and you don't save enough in a year to warrant their salary.

International purchases could possibly be cheaper.  I honestly haven't worked out the real costs for both options in detail to agree or disagree with you here.


We're not comparing it to cash though, we're comparing it to a visa card.  If we add in cash than cash probably wins the first comparison.  The third party services you're suggesting are basically what visa provides and would almost certainly cost similar amounts(escrow isn't cheap).
In the next part I wasn't talking about transactional security but security in the transaction completing as intended for all customers.   Bitcoin risk increases as you use it as well as you increase the number of attack vectors with access to your wallet by increasing the devices a hot wallet is used from.


Definitely not mistaken


No disagreement here.  But the fact that they have to assume the risk in the first place is the big struggle point that will be difficult to overcome with the general public.  They don't incur risk from credit card fraud since they are protected against it.

Ah I see what you mean.  Yes the way he describes using the cold wallet on the same machine makes it useless as well and is a better attack vector.  So really the cold wallet in this description is a cold wallet until it's first used then it becomes a hot wallet.
I'm more referring to the common public.  They won't do anything for personal security.  If you're concerned about security beyond "I should install a virus scanner(but probably not ever update it)" then you are already leagues above them.
The problem is becoming complacent while there is very little specific malware.  There is already bitcoin malware and the number of users is tiny.  If it grows even a bit there will be a lot of incentive for botnet owners and malware controllers to update their existing malware with functionality to utilize these attack vectors.  As it stands now you are so unlikely to find a bitcoin user it's not worth the overhead.

Bitcoin has you trade the possibility of inconvenience(what happens when your credit card is stolen) for catastrophic failure(what happens when you buy something and you receive nothing or your bitcoin wallet is compromised).
If you're not using any credit your credit score will be negatively impacted as well so you probably want to avoid using that in your argument.
Yes and thats why people are generally moving to using debit cards instead of cash because it removes complexities.
Email wasn't more cumbersome to use though.  I was using email back in the early/mid 90s it really wasn't as bad as you make it seem.  Most people didn't use it but that just means it wasn't useful for as many things not that it was less useful.  Have you ever mailed a letter?  Connecting to your dialup ISP and sending an email was tons easier even back then the only similarity was that not many people used it but we're not talking about adoption we're talking about ease of use.
People keep comparing it to bitcoin because bitcoin fanatics are quick to compare it with every successful technology while ignoring the failures to try and prove their point even with the similarities are slim to none.
How about you compare it to flooz or beenz or egold all of which were for essentially the same process you describe and all of which failed because it's not actually an improvement.

5. Wait 3-5 days for your bank account to verify
6. Place and order, wait a few days for it to verify

1. Find someone that either lives near you or accepts bank deposits to a bank near you
2. Meet up with individual in per(Safety!) or go deposit money in their account.
3. Feel sad about the 20% markup you just paid
4. Wait for them to verify the transaction if you did a bank deposit

Even with wide adoption you're assuming the cost to buy the bitcoin and sell it on the remote side + transfer the funds to and from the exchanges on both sides will be less cost and hassle than a simple wire transfer(and thats ignoring completely volatility in btc prices).
Bitcoin method:  Alice wires money to an exchange or uses their credit card to fund their account,  Alice buys btc on the exchange, Alice sends it you you put it in your exchange account and sell it to someone for USD then you pay the exchange to transfer the funds to you.
Current method: Alice wires the money directly to you.
The only way it gets slightly easier is if we assume everyone is always holding substantial amounts of btc.  But the odds of that happening are slim to none since for most things there are no advantages to having it.

Rothschilds are represented by a boutique investment bank that hardly ranks on the league tables and the Rockefellers are a memory.

For the first purchase but we can assume you already have an internet connection if you're planning to buy online otherwise you might as well add "Go buy a computer, call my cable company for internet, google bitcoin, try to find a market that will sell to me in my country, perform the KYC verification and wire them money, wait, wait, buy BTC, go on google and try to find a website that accepts btc for shoes, make order, ship them to my house and email me tracking".  For your second one you go on infoseek search for shoes then you click that search in results button which was awesome and type buy online then you buy your second pair without scuffing your first pair.

Giving them a bit of btc won't matter if you can't convince them of any real benefits over their existing payment methods when it comes time to get more.  It doesn't matter how many people are spending bitcoin it matters how much people are putting into the bitcoin economy.  Just spending them will just lower the price as the stores almost universally cash out immediately.

There is nothing there indicating what types of sites the majority of data came from just that it came from a lot of sources.  Unless it is like Amazon most people don't create accounts on most sites just to store their credit card details.  What are you talking about?


You know you can just as easily have your browser fill in your credit card details too right?  So that payment flow would be land on the payment screen have your browser fill in all details and be done.


Ah yes, using one authentication token that you are in control of the security for to access every site.  That is definitely an increase in security over current systems.
Multisig for authentication.  That sounds like a great plan definitely not something that completely messes up usability and 2fa already exists for a lot of websites without bitcoin.

What proof do you want?  
The people spent about $5K at Walmart after a few test transactions online(donations to some charity).  Then they paid a community college fee of a couple hundred, blew another $2K at a Bestbuy, and paid for one of those scam computer repair virus removal popup services.  All right before Christmas 2 years ago.  BoA thought they probably got it when it was behind a bar as a tab at some point leading up to that(I was in Miami vacationing/partying a lot for the two months before Christmas).
There was some hassle because it was BoA and I was in Canada at my families so trying to get them to send the replacement out of country was a pain but it still took less than a week in the end and getting the card locked and the funds put back into my account was easy.
(edit: should note the walmart/bestbuy purchases were from the online stores not in store and I never had to go to court or testify just sign a statement so I'm not sure if they caught them but given they paid for their education with it I'm guessing its a yes)

No money flowed through SWIFT.  Swift is a messaging platform not a money transfer platform.  The banks settle the transfers amongst themselves so your figure is way off since for most of that 5 Trillion it would be a case of the trades cancelling out.  I send you 5 million and you send me 10 million then at the end of the day you only need to transfer me 5 million.

Several days true but complex?  You type in your account number and branch and then type in the 2 amounts they send you.  What about the process did you find complex?  You also don't require a bank account to use Paypal.  You don't even need an account to pay people who accept paypal just a credit card.


Wait I thought it was complex?

I wouldn't normally.


I don't believe anything I've said has been false.  I've been wrong a few times I don't think anyone can say they haven't been but I've never intentionally spread false information or made false claims.


If you have a bank account and a credit card than yes coinbase is just as easy to use.  But pointless since with the same things you can just as easily pay with paypal(or directly) and have improved consumer protection that coinbase doesn't currently offer.
If you only have a bank account and no credit card or debit card then paypal is faster since they will let you pay for something out of your bank account immediately than post process the transaction to your actual bank account.


It would be.  But I'm not doing that.

Again the SWIFT system doesn't clear trades.  It's a messaging platform not a trading platform.  The members clear the trades between themselves separate from the SWIFT messaging system.
Go read that.  SWIFT doesn't facilitate the actual transfers they just handle the messaging of the data related to them the banks handle the transfers offline as it were.
When I get paid in one of my US companies from an Australian client the SWIFT network is used to notify the US bank of the transfer and yes the funds are generally settled the next day.  I think I've had 1 occurrence I can think of when they weren't.  Same for US -&gt; Ca.  Ca-&gt;Au generally takes 2 days though.
In all cases though the delay isn't in SWIFT itself but in the receiving banks ability to clear the transfers the SWIFT network is telling them about(My Canadian bank does it by hand so it's random throughout the day, my US bank does it automatically and most clear shortly after midnight).

Thank you for taking the time to think up a real scenario.  Would the cost to buy the bitcoin(either credit card, wire transfer fees, or lbc markup) and the cost for the charity to convert it back to fiat not eat up a lot of that savings though?
The only use case I can personally think of is microtipping. Which it is great for but not really enough to carry it as we've seen a lot of other solutions for that fair poorly over the past 15-20 years since demand for microtipping is low.

To be fair there is maybe 5 people that post here regularly with money from bitcoin worth being jealous of and 2 of them are facing legal issues that make me not jealous of them at all.
Almost everyone here has &lt;1 bitcoin and thinks they are rich.  And the few with &gt;1 but &lt;10 seem to think they are tycoons.
Everyone here talks about the massive increase in value bitcoin has had but almost unanimously they bought in too late to really get those returns or they were poor when they started and didn't buy much.

1. He mentions the fees for buying bitcoin but ignores the $0.15(from the exchange) and $0.06(from the transfer) he pays in his calculations.  He also handwaves over the fact most people will be using LBC or similar where they are likely paying &gt;10% in that he mentions it but doesn't do a calculation involving it

Well I was bored.  How many did I get right?
When bitcoins were &lt;$100 you spoke about a lack of liquid funds to grow your business and a desire to find a way to do so.  That says you probably didn't get many at this time.  You also apparently spent/gave away a bunch during this time so I'm guessing you didn't hit the &gt;$100 price point with very many left due to your liquidity issues.
In November near the peak you were unable to afford an ATM with a cost of $20K so that tells me you definitely didn't have many coins in the run up.  You also spent a bunch on "cheap coins" in the $800s and $700s by the looks of it.  And when you complained about coinbase cancelling your orders most were in the $40-50 range with what looks like 2 attempts to buy $500 worth.
You mention having a paycheck today so I'm guessing you're not primarily working on your ebay business still? 
All that said I'm guessing you have around 30 coins and you're probably trying to spend $200 here and your cost basis is either very close to the current price or a bit over it.

The difference is that there was nothing the internet was competing with.

If you best case scenario for your tech is that it works as well as the existing tech mass adoption isn't going to happen.

Fine but there were two other questions there "How were you handling payments previously? How to you know when you've been paid using the pre-made HTML buttons?"
Can you do it yourself though?  You haven't given any example that would work except in a situation where you have a human do all order processing and verification by hand.


Worse but they make up for it by having people actually pay using their service.
So what you mean by no cost is that as long as you're using a service that accepts bitcoin as a payment method it is zero cost.  And you don't see that as dishonest?

He reported $15 in fees per transaction times 3 transactions.  If he was withdrawing $4500 I'd say thats really not that bad.  He'd get much worse selling on LBC or at a bitcoin ATM or even counting the spread using Bitpay in more situations.
I've never experienced an ATM fee that is % based like you're use to so I can't really comment on that.
The airport is usually the worse but if the local ATMs have stupid fees + the exchange rate from your bank on foreign currency withdraws it's usually not that much worse and sometimes a bit better for smallish amounts(a couple hundred bucks).  I typically don't need &gt;$1000 in cash when I travel unless I'm at a casino.
Is it 1% for all ATM transactions?  Does it include local bank fees?  Does it have a minimum?  What bank is it seems a really odd system.

I'm personally offended that you think I'm young. :P
I honestly started with the internet and unix in 93-94 so not right near the beginning but a bit of a head start on most.
The issue I see with that is that even back then though they weren't currently feasible due to bandwidth or whatever people had thousands of ideas for ways the internet could improve every day life over the existing alternatives.
I'm not seeing that with bitcoin and thats why I don't think it's a fair comparison.  All the layers and functionality I'm seeing with bitcoin to make it usable and secure for general users are trying to replicate the features that already exist in other systems and they almost universally suggest basically taking the same routes as the existing systems.  So I'm not seeing innovation I'm seeing copying and I'm seeing them having the same issues with centralization and fees as the current systems.  If I'm right then there is no reason for most people to switch to bitcoin.  Though I've been wrong many times before and I wouldn't be upset in the least if I was wrong in this case.  Quite the opposite in fact.

Why is it redundant?  If new people aren't brought into the network of users then usage will shrink and the price will drop as merchants have a harder time straight converting their incomes to fiat since less people will be buying in and the existing users will essentially be cashing out.

Security: I don't think it's fair to say no more worries when a mistake that allows people access to your wallet will result in total loss instead of just inconvenience.  
Accessibility: You aren't talking about merchants here you're talking about your friends.  Normally when you pay them back they get charged 0 fees.

I personally would think a digital gift card for the app would qualify as content since it is the whole purpose of the app(ebooks could be used outside the app too) but the app is there so assuming its not pulled from the app store soon I would guess your definition will be the correct one.  Which I think would open up a lot of possibilities in apps outside of bitcoin.

You're a bit mistaken there.  They don't have any merchant/gateway roll in it at all.  Merchants would still use their traditional gateways and merchant accounts with it.  Applepay would generate a one time card number/details and pass that to the merchant who would then process it exactly the same as they would any other credit card transaction.  Apple isn't involved in the payment itself only in the generation of the single use card numbers.

They can bring cash.  Maybe pay cheques isn't the phrase where you live.  Pay slips?

Why?  It takes no effort or cost for most merchants to add it.  Yes and since they've launched they've seen 6 months to steadily decreasing bitcoin sales.
Coinbase doesn't require ID to open an account.  They also don't limit that count to accounts with bitcoin in them and lots of scammers spam new accounts regularly.  If they reported monthly active users with balances &gt;$50 I'd be interested or monthly uniques that bought/sold during the month but they won't ever do that since it will almost certainly be flat/shrinking instead of an overall account number which they can show as always growing.  First rule of startups report the accounts not the users.

@_date: 2014-06-21 21:01:07


In my experience.  You call the bank report the bad transactions.  They cancel them so you get the funds back immediately then send you a document to sign basically promising that you didn't make those charges and that you would press charges if they caught the person that did.  And then you wait a few days for a new card.


So with bitcoin your security depends on never making a mistake with computer security.  A solid plan.

Almost all the benefits in using bitcoin are stacked in a merchants favour and the ones that benefit users tend not to really be important enough for anyone to care about(worrying about credit card theft for example due to insurance).
Then you have the added hump of them actually having to acquire bitcoin to spend it.  "But Circle and Trucoin offer credit card sales now!" which is true but if I have a credit card just buying from the store is still faster and I don't have to worry about how to secure bitcoin in the short term.
Can't get a credit card or debit card/bank account?  Then I can't use any of the good ways to buy bitcoin and will be paying at least a 5% markup if I have an ATM near me and probably 10-15% if I don't.  Or I can just go to walmart and get a prepaid Visa.

Then everyone needs to be setup to facilitate bank transfers or credit cards or you depend on a 3rd party to handle that(which is what a centralized exchange does).  You also increase the cost of every transaction by this method and require users to negotiate payment terms on every transaction.


Sounds like you're not talking about an exchange at all.  You're talking about a marketplace.
You're plan for making a distributed exchange is apparently to skip the parts of an exchange that make it useful for trading.  Great plan.  Sounds like a winner.

If Visa or Mastercard get hacked and have their databases stolen there will be a lot bigger issues than just individuals identities being stolen.  Same for any large bank.
I'm guessing all your transactions must be tiny.  Long arduous process?  Seriously?  I've had my card stolen 3 times.  Once by a pickpocket and twice online.  In the first instance I called the bank immediately and they cancelled the card and I had a new one a few days later.  In the second I noticed the charges called the bank and they cancelled all the charges on my account that I claimed were fraudulent, cancelled the card and sent me a new one and a statement to sign saying the charges were not mine.  Two different banks including BoA which isn't known for their great customer support.
Either you use the worst bank in the world or you're exaggerating the process.

That doesn't change anything since it's a zero sum network the broker in India should always have to cash out X to local people.
(We'll put everything in dollars to avoid dealing with conversions below though we both know thats not 100% accurate)  
Broker A in Dubai collects $100,000 for India  
Broker B in India collects $10,000 for Dubai, $20,000 for England  
Broker C in England collects $30,000 for India  
When they clear up broker B has to pay out $130,000 to local people regardless of the fact that they have commitments of $30K overseas.
So if they use btc they still have to offload $130K into a local exchange/to locals before they can do that or they need to sell it on an international exchange and worry about getting the money locally through other means.  In which case they might as well just use bank transfers since it defeats the purpose.

The global amount doesn't matter to you since you aren't going to capture 100% of the worlds business from your bedroom.  It is how many people are doing it and where they are that matters for your little business.
The fact that you can't understand what I'm saying doesn't mean it's wrong it means you're easily confused.


Because you started this whole thing saying Paris.


And you only believe this because you don't understand 99% of the business you're proposing to replace and as such have no clue about the user catchment areas or other expenses involved.  Ignorance is bliss I guess.


Expenses you would have to deal with.  Ignorance of catchment areas are the two main ones.  You've just gone "People will travel to visit me to save money".  But you're costing them time and money to save a few dollars and you think that is realistic?  Secondly you hand wave over the security issue completely.  When I point out the difficulty and cost in organising multiple people to be on both ends to handle more than a few dozen people you somehow read that as me suggesting you have to provide security for users and try to completely change the conversation.
Since you're so easily confused though I'll try to lay it out for you again using only small words.
1. Remittances require you to have a location near both the sender and receiver.  No one is going to travel very far to send or receive money since they would be losing more than the fees in lost time and travel expenses to do so.  
2. Remittances require you to have the cash available to pay people.  That requires security to store it and transport it.  Neither of which is free.  
3. To get 1 above you need to coordinate with a lot of people around the world.  You also need to ensure they are trustworthy before adding them to your network since they could technically just take the users money and run.
You now have the following overheads Security, management, background checks and monitoring, insurance for customers in the event that a bad party still makes it into the system, advertising, and lastly overheads from circle/your bank transfers and associated conversion spreads.  Now compare that with western union who has all of that except the last one since they do it all in house.

1.  BitTorrent isn't illegal and the copyright infringement cases are all private cases not state ones.  If the government made copyright infringement a criminal offence and pursued it there would be a lot of people in jail tomorrow.  I'm not sure what your second point has to do with the first here.  Could you elaborate?
2.  That isn't routing around regulation and unless you're suggesting we all move to Lagos isn't really dealing with the issue either.
3. You'll have to pay for certain services and taxes in fiat or risk running into issues with the feds gunning you down.

There doesn't have to be negotiation nor does my example above require it.  In that case the buyer gets something kind of like they want and they have the choice between paying more than double the price it is worth or paying a little bit more than it is worth.  Almost everyone will pick the little bit more in that case. Also if you read your wiki article you will see it noted that dragging out the process increases the likelihood of someone to accepting an unfair offer.  Imagine you're sitting there with 1btc tied up in escrow.  It would eat away at you every day.

So bitpesa will offer remittance services to local currency for 8% minimum then since the sender still has to buy bitcoin on their side and since they are unbanked it is LBC or ATMs right?


Credit card companies use their tons of knowledge to detect when something happens out of the norm on your credit card spending and stop the payments.  When they miss it you get reimbursed pretty much immediately not "may reimburse you eventually".
Push based systems fail for subscriptions which is what a lot of payments for online are.  They are not a reliable form of payment.

Yes except prepaid cards and store cards are easy to cancel when the chargeback comes in and they are still easy to trace usage on if you're getting products delivered so they are still worth less.
With circle you can buy your bitcoin with your stolen card transfer it to your own wallet and it is completely unrecoverable.
You are right that overall carding numbers are low.  But certain things attract them in droves when they appear.  purse.io for example and now circle because they allow the carder to extract maximum value through a method that allows them to stay almost completely anonymous(no need to a drop or a risky in store purchase with a cloned card)
@_date: 2014-06-08 19:56:16
The problem is that you assume the other side will have incentive to keep the costs low.  As it is a transaction involving buying btc then selling btc in a normal western bitcoin ATM costs a bit over 10%.  That is where they are incentivized to keep them cheap.  Operators in smaller communities won't have that incentive and will mark it up a lot.  Don't expect it to be any cheaper than existing solutions.

Online banking hit 10% of the banking population after 5 years.  Remember this was very early days for the general public to be accessing the internet too it wasn't everywhere like it is now.


Email grow in line with the internet.  So as soon as it was generally available it exploded doubling something like every 6 months.

Why would Facebook a company with over a billion users implement a crypto currency it didn't control which has a user base of around 1 million(probably much less).  If they introduced their own cryptocoin tomorrow and integrated it into the site it would dwarf bitcoin in a hour.


And more get offline every day after seeing no bitcoin sales for months.


People said that when US banks started buying up banks in Mexico.  In the end they realized there is no need to drop the prices.  Bitcoin is the same transferring the bitcoin is cheap but you still have to find someone on the other side near you to give you cash and that is where the fees will appear.


Micropayments have been tried time and time again.  People will pay for tv episodes and stuff in games but those are the only two things which have show any adoption by the public.  People don't want micropayments for their news stories, etc and when it comes to $1 things sold through marketplaces the overhead from the credit cards/etc isn't really that bad in the end.

Honestly at your stage it doesn't matter.  Pick a language that looks readable to you and learn the concepts first(Say Python).  Then pick another(Maybe Ruby this time) and try to apply the basic concepts you learned from the first(variables, classes if they both have them, methods, procedures, flow control, etc) to learning the second.  Once you've done that you can worry about picking a language to contribute to a specific technology field.

Sending bitcoin directly to people as remittance isn't a good idea because it can't scale.  You will have a lot of people in an area trying to sell bitcoin locally and few people with the international connections to make buying it useful so you will end up with huge markdowns on the price for people trying to sell it.

Because you want Euros at your destination.  So either you're going to buy bitcoin locally and convert it back at the remote destination or you're going to use your credit card and have it automatically do the conversion in which case why bother with the bitcoins at all.
Your example of currency exchange being expensive was to literally pick the most expensive option and do it on a number so low that the flat rate convenience charge would be a huge percentage.  Your manufactured a negative situation.  You maybe didn't lie but you were still being dishonest.

Private break then the person could use it to essentially get a 51% attack without spending much on hardware this would lead to downward pressure on the price but probably not crash it until someone found out.  They could also reduce the block time dramatically to increase their short term earnings.  The subsequent difficulty increases would likely put a lot of their competitors out of business leaving them in total control of the network.
Public break:
It would make all miners worthless instantly and drop the difficulty level back down to an almost nothing level.  All the major farms would go out of business as they wouldn't be able to replace all their miners from scratch, all the ASIC companies would go out of business too as their inventory and technology is instantly worthless.  Bitcoin would be back at altcoin level of difficulty and would likely just be replaced at this point by one of the better featured alt coins in popularity since you'd have to change the POW stuff and fuck with the block chain.  It's all but worthless at this point.  The major companies like bitpay/coinbase can easily swap out their coin of choice and would likely do so at this point.

I can't believe you are still trying to argue this.  It's ok to admit you were wrong.  Learning is good.


The step by step flow for TLS client certificates(simplified):
1.  Give the website your public key you then sign messages using your private key and send it to the website.  They do the same on their side(so you know you're communicating with the right server).  If the signatures check out they verify
2.  The client says everything from here on out is authenticated and the server says the same.
It's the exact same flow.  Seriously the only difference is bitauth uses bitcoin addresses and TLS client certificate support exists in almost ever browser out there.  Oh and bitauth has serious MITM attack vector issues.  It isn't used because its a pain in the ass and no one likes doing it.

No there isn't.  Not even close.  The first example that comes to mind is internet access.

Transfers are free now but once the popularity goes up to dreamed about levels they will stop being free.
Want to transfer my brother in Germany $100?  I first have to buy $100 worth of btc on my side which costs me a % from a market or exchange.  So I probably have to buy $110.  Then I need to send it to him and he needs to sell it via a market or exchange which will take a cut as well so thats back down to $100 maybe a bit less given the massive fluctuations in the value of btc.  Thats not even counting the transaction fees.

Can you give an actual answer or are you just trying to distract from the question?  What in the average westerners day to day life is bitcoin better for ignoring embarrassing or illegal purchases?
@_date: 2014-04-04 13:28:10
It isn't that much better(if at all) for most people for almost all regular transactions and almost all it's benefits are niche cases.  It provides increased vender security at the cost of consumer security.  So merchants will flock to accept it at first but getting consumers to accept that will be very difficult.  Once you get to in person transactions it's an extra layer of overhead on your transactions that doesn't make any sense for most people.

Congrats! I once did ETL development at MS myself but I left banking for startups as I find them more enjoyable even with the lowered budgets.  Though I didn't really learn anything much about finance when I was doing it since I wasn't like a quant or anything and they mostly kept to themselves in training sessions.


I've answered this repeatedly but I'll do it again.  They've had a negative impact because despite being repeatedly held up as the first major player and all the interest from the bitcoin world they have had horrible bitcoin sales.  So anyone else seeing that will say "Everyone into bitcoin apparently loves them yet no one is spending there.  I guess they just don't spend".  If they ignore that and go ahead and start accepting bitcoin though they will quickly discover that their first thought was right and accepting bitcoin makes almost no one money since the user numbers are tiny and those with it aren't spending it for the most part.

Plenty of merchants turn away customers every day.  Not all revenue is worth it.  A bitcoin integration would cost them a fair bit of time and money and given the history of merchants accepting bitcoin its not really surprising they won't go through that.  
Bitcoiners are loud as fuck at demanding companies(and charities) accept bitcoin then when they do no one uses it.  Then when the company stops accepting bitcoin the users go mental again.  
The only way to win is to bluntly tell them to fuck off from the start.  You'll probably lose a few dozen potential customers but they probably wouldn't have used your services after the first day anyhow so who cares.

You have to keep enough onhand to secure every possible transaction.  Thats basically the sale value of everything you want to sell sitting around in money to enable you to put it up anytime there is an order.
So in the situation I put forward you would pay double for the used xbox instead of just paying the scammer and getting half your money back?  Honestly?
You haven't actually made any points against my arguments.  You point out the flaw with 1 in that for any purchase except minor ones having multiple times the value on hand is going to be rare.
For the second one you misunderstood completely(I explained it again above).
And for the 3rd your answer is that a customer would willingly pay 2x the price just to spite the seller.  Thats not likely to happen at all is it.  Read my story again and tell me you'd rather pay $1000 just to spite the vendor than just give in and give them their $500 and accept your loss.

Why do you think bitcoin remittances would be cheaper?  Bitcoin ATMs in the first world already charge 5%.  Why would a buyer in these countries pay full market value when its a buyers market?  They wouldn't and I bet their premium would be at least 10%.  That makes the total cost assuming LBC/Bitcoin ATM ~15%.

I didn't start with that statement.  You asked for examples and I gave them.  I included the more investment than bitcoin companies because last time I had checked it was true but it wasn't relevant all that mattered was that flooz and beenz were shitty with a lot of VC.  You went off on a tangent about the second claim and asked for different examples.  Where I again gave you examples of shitty products that have had tons of VC poored into them which you are now saying weren't shitty despite never having used them.
You're arguing in favour of the quality of products that you never used just because you read on a website that they had shitty management.  Think about that for a second.

Its very confusing and there is a lot of different rules that would potentially overlap for and against it being valid.  When that happens I tend to side with Apple removing it when they realize they let the update through.  
You are right there I've read average margins around 8% on gift cards.  So we're looking at 2% tops here.  I'm sure these get used at a higher rate than traditional gift cards too so that might be even lower than 8% since a lot of that is on the basis of people not using any or most of their values.

Why do people in any of those places need to see currency outside of their rural area?


So their experience with digital currencies is one of random and unexpected deflation and you think this gives them a good impression of digital items as currency?


While some of the countries and places would use USD most of these places don't have that bad of inflation that it would be worth it.  Especially not the bags part which is something you see in hyper inflating countries and honestly who is going to buy their bag of money for bitcoin anyhow?


What are these rural people with no internet doing cross-border trade for?  Any goods they would have to move across the border subject to the same corrupt officials.


I'm in North-East Thailand right now and I've not seen any bags of money or trading of phone cards nor any demand to send money over seas.

2 Trillion didn't go missing.  What was said was that the financial systems between departments don't allow for the easy tracking of a lot of transactions(which added up to $2.3 trillion).  On a department by department case they could be accounted for but because the reporting systems didn't work together they had to be done case by case.  And that is a problem since it allows for issues with accountability.

You're not going to hire a team of decent programmers with finance backgrounds for that.  And you're not going to get in with a group of them as a company either since you bring nothing to the table nothing but 20-25% of one of their annual salaries and asking for 5% of the company in exchange.  Anyone worth building it would just look the other way so you're only going to end up with the low end of the spectrum.


Right so now you have multiple people who have kicked in $1 million and all the ownership is doled out and now what?  First thing you do is dilute all of them a lot so you actually have a reasonable option pool for talent so his 5% is pointless.  Secondly you blow all that $1 million on legal expenses and salaries for a few months and hope that you have enough to convince a VC to toss more money at you.
If getting a legitimate US exchange going was as easy as raising $1 million there would be dozens of them by now but there isn't because you're ignoring a lot of complexity.

Given his real life problems I'm not sure its satire.
As for why people are turning on him I'd guess for most people boredom.  It's funny at first but it just gets tiring listening to a crazy person rant.  He basically spends all his time talking about what he is going to do but he never actually does anything.  That gets tiresome really quickly.
Also a lot of bitcoin people are probably annoyed that he has started trying to pump Monero constantly(He apparently converted 25% of his bitcoin stash to Monero right before it dropped like 20% so I guess it fits in well with his other investments).

In reply to your Bitcoin is succeeding post from the other day.
Sure thing.


Notice they don't put MAU/DAU?  Number of wallets and users are vanity metrics that never go down and aren't limited to one per user.  Coinbase removed all numbers that actually indicate usage last year.


It looks flat for all of 2015.


Number of transactions is indeed up


Volume increase makes sense with dropping prices


I'm guessing you didn't look but this one is actually going down.


Pointless vanity metric


By going strong you mean leveled out completely?


Leveling out as well.


This isn't true.  Notice how since just after Mar 2015 all the numbers are below $50m and at all points between then and Nov 2013 it was above.  So this chart actually shows a drop in usage.


Again this is clearly showing a drop over the past year and a bit


Vanity metric since this number never drops.  Blockchain like coinbase refuses to release MAU/DAU.


Finally we've hit some growth in transactions.  Same as external transactions.


Shows a fall off over the past year


Same as above.  Falling for a year now.
Even more interestingly, check out how Google Trends are looking in...
















Given you have misread your past two google trends links thinking they show growth when they don't I'm not going to bother checking these.


Number of commits is actually way down in 2015 vs 2014.  Happens almost right at new years though so could be a new merge policy or something.  If you're not familiar with github go back to the main page for the repo and click on graphs on the right to see this.


The very first entry on that list doesn't take bitcoin anymore.


There have been 3 unicorn deals the rest of the market has fallen off.  We'll see if it continues this quarter.


It is actually shrinking in usage(unique visitors and pageviews)

Bitcoin is worse as a payment system in almost every way than credit cards(unless you're genuinely scared about giving a store your address) so I wouldn't expect growth there(nor has there been almost no one is seeing any volume of sales in bitcoin).
Remittance with bitcoin is no better than existing services.  The cost isn't in transferring funds its in delivering local currency and won't go away with bitcoin.
Those are the two biggest usages given for it other than a store of value which isn't going to bring growth and neither of them is actually any good.

1. Advertisers with a budget worth going after don't want to deal with publishers directly.  It would be cheaper for them to have a middle man.
2.  Advertisers want stats and details on their traffic, they also want things like fraudulent click protection.  That requires centralization
3.  Publishers also want stats
4.  Publishers definitely want to control who is showing ads on their site and the ads that are shown though they often outsource this to third parties to manage(ad networks)
5.  There is a lot more to ad serving than just showing ads on a site.
6.  How do you determine how many ads to show?  If you require a transaction per view you will end up paying more in miners fees than any network would charge.

They have the means but they don't generally need it was my point.  There are ~1400 billionaires.  They probably have general security but most don't need a personal bodyguard at all times.
There are something like 200K individuals worth over $30 million dollars.  Almost none of those will have personal security unless they are in a few specific industries.  
Almost none of those individuals are kidnapped and ransomed for their wealth in a given year despite this lack of security.
Kidnapping/ransoming isn't an easy crime to get away with and not a common one unless you're a paramilitary group with control of an area.
All the threats against Mr. Nakamoto are in the minds of the bitcoin community who seem to ignore every other high wealth individual in the world when doing their threat assessment.  I'd doubt very much if he's received any realistic threats from this.

First up you're ignoring the bitpay/coinbase spread when calculating the fees.
Secondly you're ignoring the most important part of a payment system isn't vender buy in but customer buy in.

Vanity metric that never shrinks.  Get back to me when any of the big companies release MAU/DAU.  


Change in use cases can massive increase this without any increase in adoption.


Becoming more centralized into a handful of companies.


Because no one goes back to check if merchants are still accepting bitcoin this ends up being another always growing metric yet there is tons of evidence that very few merchants keep accepting bitcoin for long.


Use cases exist but we have no data on if they are actually being used and if there is demand.

Like most of these huge discount bitcoin companies it is being subsidized by credit card fraud.  Though the companies will claim it is legitimate users just needing to offload unused cards they won't explain why those users will sell to them at a 25% discount when there are other sites that will buy them for a 7-10% discount but pay through traditional means.  The only reason to take the extra 15% hit is if you've sourced the cards via questionable means and want a payment method that is less directly connected to your identity.

Then they'd just assume you acquired them at a value of 0 if you cannot prove otherwise.
I mean when you file your taxes they would up the amount you owe to cover the difference to match up with fair market value.
Simplified example below:
Say you claim you spent 10 bitcoins at a claimed value of $1000 total and you pay your taxes on it of 25%($250) for the capital gains.  They look at that and say "Fair market value at that time was $5000 actually, you owe us another $1000.

You're expecting the average person with 5 toolbars on the IE to be able to secure their computer.  In fact you require that for widespread adoption.
How long has it seriously taken you to get your cards unlocked?  Every time it's happened to me across my 3 banks(1 US, 1 Can, 1 AU) it's consisted of proving my identity by answering 2 or 3 questions about my accounts with them then saying yes or no to a list of transactions.  10 minutes top.  Call them collect as well every bank will accept collect calls from customers.
The main flaw that people in this community ignore however is that the experience for almost everything legal people do isn't better for consumers.  All the advantages are on the supplier side and thats why you're seeing a lot of shops taking bitcoin but you never hear numbers about actual usage outside overstock and their numbers are far from impressive and they have to keep releasing press releases to the community to keep numbers up and remind people they are the big bitcoin taking company.
For buying something online I have to first acquire bitcoin.  That means either I have to use a credit card(or more likely pay for a wire transfer) to buy bitcoin then I can make my transaction.  If I want to avoid that I end up paying a premium on the bitcoin itself by using lbc or something similar and for that premium I might as well pay a much smaller one and get a prepaid credit card.   It's possible that I'll hold some of my cash in bitcoin and only do this every so often so lets assume every 5 times I have to do that.  Thats still a huge hassle.
Then on top of that I give up consumer protection, loss insurance, and a unified rewards system so that I can save the retailer 1% on processing fees.
Unless you own lots of btc as an early adopter or an investor or you want to do something illegal the advantages really aren't there to make doing your transaction in btc make sense.

They can easily dominate mining.  One company has managed to do it quite easily up to now.
Set up a few pools that you control.  Throw your resources at them to get them way above 51%.  I bet you could get above that with less than a $200m budget to invest in hardware.  You don't even need to provide all the computing power just make your pools interesting enough to attract other miners as well.
At this point you can always have the longest chain in your control.  Use that to orphan blocks from any other pool while increasing the minimum transaction fee you accept to your blocks.  Eventually the other miners go out of business and bitcoin becomes too expensive for users.
So then we change the PoW function!  Then we're back to people using GPU miners, the price would crash to nothing and they can repeat the process again if it starts to grow again.

I'm not talking about changing values.  I'm talking specifically about fees in the process.  To spend bitcoin you first need to buy them.  You pay fees for that so not including those fees in your calculation is dishonest since you are hiding the larger fees.
If you paid $10 in fees to buy $100 in bitcoin then bought something for $50 of bitcoin your fees would be $5+ the transaction fee.  Not just the transaction fee.

I'm not.  You said retailers add 3% to the price to cover the credit cards.  Unless the retailer is giving you 3% or more off you are paying that fee as well.
My wires cost $20.  Even at $35 that is $5 less than the $40 from blockchain.
If you're sending $1000 with bitcoin it costs you X directly and it costs everyone else the difference between that and $40.  If you send $100,000 it will cost you X directly and still cost everyone else the difference between that and $40.
You're not getting cheaper transfers you're just spreading the cost across everyone.  So you're paying every 10 minutes for everyones transactions.

Miners are paid 25btc for every block they process in addition to the fees people pay.  So that is part of the cost of those transfers they are just covered by inflation instead of direct payment.

I think it's great news for bitcoin but I don't really think it will change anything ultimately regarding the success of bitcoin.  I think the community is basically treating this experiment as a success before its even really started.
There is a [long history of major companies doing stuff involving bitcoin being pointed to as a reason it's going to hit mainstream success imminently]( and there is a long history of those predictions being wrong.  
For now I sit and see if they actually make any progress with this but I personally don't see the advantage for them.  They still need third party auditing of the assets since you don't want a security lapse to cause someone to lose their securities.  And if you're still going to do third party auditing you need a third party of trust to do it and if you're going to have that you might as well just have them manage the ledger.

The reason they have to convert it to their local currency is that there isn't ways to pay for all the essentials they need with bitcoin.  So if they don't convert it then they don't get to eat/pay for the things the remitted money was sent for.  Also if you're receiving remittance it is probably not a wise move to turn around and keep it invested in a highly volatile/high risk asset given that even small fluctuations down will likely leave you short on necessities.

So people that don't like me here, you now know the best way to shut me up.  Get petitioning for data.

1) Identity theft is overrated as a fear.  In almost any situation where you'd give anything other than your credit card number to someone you'd have to with bitcoin as well.
2) The spread exists on both sides with bitcoin too it's just harder to see because of the rapid fluctuations in price.
3) Merchants will sometimes pass the savings on.  A handful have done so but it's not the norm even now.
@_date: 2014-06-06 01:17:57
1) Your taxes AREN'T automatically deducted.  You have to figure out your own taxes and pay them.  You already have to do this.  Bitcoin changes nothing.  Seriously how old are you that you don't know this stuff but apparently have never worked for someone else?
2)  And a huge number of people are in jail because of it too.  Drugs are also largely secret.  If they outlawed the use of bitcoin then it would be easy to busy merchants using it making the risk too high to bother.
3) Then why do they comply today?
@_date: 2014-06-09 03:31:50
Nope they are equally responsible for both and since they are removing them as they are reported they are doing their duty and no lawyer will take this case unless you're willing to pay them a lot up front.
Even if they didn't remove them though do you really want to go down the route that linking to something makes you liable for whats on the other side of the link?

It generally doesn't work out so well for most of the people trying to do it as a business.  It's too easy to bust people involved since you have financial transactions.  
Look at online Gambling.  It got to the point where if you were involved in a payment network that dealt with online casinos and US citizens you would likely get arrested every time you got on a plane flying near the US(they redirected at least one plane to an emergency landing on US soil to arrest some poker room bosses).
You can't make it immune to regulation and mass market they go hand in hand.

Don't get too excited there is one or more players who have lately been pushing the transaction volume way up by processing very small payments one per transaction instead of grouping them.

I missed this one.  I am amazed they would lose that but I assume it was part way through one of the 5 above?


There were no losses from CC fraud in those.  Credit cards have 0 liability guarantees from visa/mastercard.  They just included credit card fraud in the numbers of the articles to make the amount loss sound greater.


The one almost all of them lost money to was clicking on phishing mails and entering their details(including in most cases their 2fa details).  Those problems are possible with bitcoin since most people will be storing them on their web services.
Good finds though thanks for the info.

Yes I noticed you link the specifics and post it after you said "It's better that you read the law commissions report on retarded old UK laws.
You'll have to try to trust me on this - the UK Law Commission is a far more reliable source when it comes to UK law than the BBC."
Which is why I questioned why you even bothered posting the first stuff.  You could have just said "Oh oops it was something I heard".


Nope.  I believe that if you do something that is against the law that you don't believe is just you should be willing to accept the consequences and fight against the law in court.  Laws are repelled that way.


Yes you keep claiming that yet I have more money in my wallet right now than you have on your order book.  How about you be the first market to release your MAU figures?  Lead the way to full disclosure?


Well I would read the act and realize it has to do with trading in locally poached Salmon and it specifically says only in cases where the person makes an effort to conceal the fact and isn't acting in good faith.  Then I'd go about my day because I'm not a Salmon poacher.

* the client has carried out trade transactions, in significant size (at least EUR 50,000), on the relevant market at an average frequency of 10 per quarter over the previous four quarters;
* the size of the client's financial instrument portfolio, defined as including cash deposits and financial instruments, exceeds EUR 500,000;
* the client works or has worked in the financial sector for at least one year in a professional position which requires knowledge of the transactions or services envisaged.

It's only worthless if it is easy for any miners to work on the network in a way that allows them control.  That's a requirement for full distributed PoW blockchains but it's not the only way.  Arguably it's not even the best way for something like this.  Wall St doesn't have an aversion to centralization after all and a small bit of centralization would go a long way to making a lot more effective system for their needs while still allowing for a distributed public ledger.

It's actually the opposite dude.  All a deflationary economy would do would laden your society with a bunch of people who don't need to contribute to society anymore but have growing resources.  That's called a leach.


Unless you have family


Which reduces economic activity to a minimum.


Earn it how?  If not one is willing to spend money because in 200 years it will be a Jupiter cruise how are these people going to get paid?


That sounds great in theory but look around the world and tell me how many people can afford to horde resources.  All you're doing is centralizing that money.  Common people would still need loans only they get more expensive every day so its harder for them to dig themselves out of debt.  Their pay would be worth less on payday than on the day they worked.
The whole setup only favours the already rich and it would just allow them to concentrate their wealth more and reduce the economic impact they are currently required to have to maintain their wealth.
My thought is you are pretty much a financial train wreck and very lazy so you constantly think up scenarios where you can get rich with no work.  The thing is given you regularly take loans out you would be one of the ones it is hurting not helping.  You're like a poor republican.

It is a flop in attracting mainstream attention to bitcoin.  I've already made my definition of flop clear repeatedly here and in the original post.  Stop trying to redefine it to make your points.  Why might they invest?  Because early stage investors are pack beings and social proof goes a surprisingly long way to pushing investments.  Maybe they believe it could turn around who knows.

I agree it's worth trying to settle the issue at that point and I'm sure that will work sometimes but when it becomes clear the seller is indeed a scammer it becomes more beneficial to cash out the smallest loss possible for the consumer.
Scammers don't care about reputation online it's easy enough to just swap out your name once it starts to negatively effect you.  
The only way to deal with that is by using reputation systems which are either easy to game or impose a really difficult you surpass barrier to trust.
Ultimately your system solves the problem for the retailer which with bitcoin is already a solved problem.  Bitcoin is great for retailers.  Maybe put more focus in your efforts to solving it from the customer position something that traditional methods currently are much better at.

1. Getting bitcoins to use in a transaction often involves using the same payment systems you could just use for the transaction or fees that end up being higher than traditional payment methods(paypal, credit card)

I don't know how else to explain this?
In cases where the collateral is lower than the withdraw fees at other services it will make more sense to scam on this since you offload the fees to the buyer.  The person buying the BTC will be the one paying the bank fees to transfer the money.  So in situations where the collateral is lower than the withdraw cost that you would pay other services to send you money it makes more sense to scam this protocol.
Lets say you want to sell 0.1BTC for $100 and you find a match and the collateral is 0.01BTC($10).  If it would cost you any more than $10 to wire money to you on another service than it makes sense to scam on this one.

VC funding is how they are paying for things now.  It isn't how they plan to/are making money.  Their 1% on withdrawals makes no sense and wouldn't fund the founder let alone a whole team.  There is no advertising angle.  The only thing of value they have is ways to link bitcoin addresses to social media accounts and payment history data.

Yes, I think 1.5m accounts on blockchain is less than 1m users hell at least 5 of those wallets are mine. And I think there is large overlap between all of the online bitcoin services so you can't stack them.


How fast are you growing? What were your monthly unique users 8 months ago, 5 months ago, and this month?  Just a quick look shows you have ~3btc in your sell book and about $2000 in buys.  How much of that is you and your partner?  After 8 months and almost all of those are at unrealistic prices.  Your volume shows &lt;84gbp but there is no way to see for what time period that is and I don't know where thats coming from because your completed orders is blank.  If you've been seeing steady growth for 8 months and this is where you're at it might be worth cutting your loses since by my calculation you're making what 1/3rd of a cent each day?


I guess you ignore all the people posting here.

Not with ATMs it is usually 5% on each end of the deal.  You could maybe get a premium if you become an LBC dealer but then you're just trading a few dollars in fees for how ever long it takes you to arrange a sale, go and meet with someone in person with your smart phone(risky) and get your cash.
@_date: 2015-05-19 07:27:38
It really doesn't matter if they allow for it.  There is no way it is worth it to spend money mining for such a small potential reward(that is average reward at current difficulty too, once you start adding these devices difficulty will go up and reward will drop).
You need like 3 years worth of mining to earn enough to pay the fees for a single transaction at those rates(assuming no increases in difficulty).
@_date: 2015-05-14 20:58:34
Lets hear your ways to monetize this product.  I'll give you two.  1.  Selling user data, might make enough to pay one persons salary.  2. Taking a % of withdrawals as fees.  Would likely not even pay for the office lunch even if they grew to 100x their current size.
What else can you think of?  They can't take a slice off every transaction since that would kill their business immediately.
Tipping isn't new online.  They are far from the first it is just all the other ones realized there is no demand and no money in doing it so they shut down.

Who said it was lower?  Handling request spam is easy most customer service desks will have templates to handle things like that and integrating a new payment system in a large complex codebase(and company) is going to be costly.


And plenty of them do their books with a pen and paper at the end of the day and don't have to integrate those payment systems into an existing workflow.

The problem with comparing it to the internet is that the internet itself has sped up the distribution of new technologies and ideas immensely.  You can't compare the spread of ideas/technology pre-internet with post-internet.  In the post internet sense bitcoin is stagnating.
People will say "But its about money and its harder to get people to change that!" but they ignore the fact that 15 years ago Paypal(which had just that year became Paypal) went from 12,000 to 2.7 million users in the first 8 months of the year.  By the next year they had 12.8 million accounts.  20% of which or 2.6m of those were business accounts.  Hard was getting people to give up their credit card details online in 2000 and 2001.
Compare that to bitcoins growth after 6 years in both personal and business situations.
Bitcoin isn't dead and is far from it.  But that doesn't mean its a success either.

Yes and despite what everyone here seems to believe the number of people using bitcoin is tiny(like &lt;1m tiny).  Any of the big tech companies(Google, Microsoft, Facebook, Amazon) could release a competitor tomorrow and with less than 1% of their users trying it have more users than bitcoin.
I'm not talking about currencies I'm talking about software and protocols.  


That is what you said.  I pointed out that even closed source applications can be updated and improved so your point was pointless.

I already have probably fair gambling with pokerstars and live casinos. Hell even most online casinos are regulated.  Any I would think of using anyhow.  Provably fair gaming is a bitcoin thing but I don't like playing the just-dice style games.  I find them boring.


Remittance isn't that expensive if you don't need a few things.  Mainly the ability for the receiver to pick up local currency close to their home.  Once you require that though which is most cases for remittance then bitcoin isn't cheaper at all due to markups at ATMs, LBC, etc.


Bitcoin is bad for microtransactions since there is a 5c fee for everything.  If you're doing them off blockchain like with changetip you can just use a credit card to send change tip $20 and its the same thing.


If the dollar fails spectacularly your bitcoin won't be worth anything as we'll be having an international crisis which will certainly make general internet access prohibitively expensive.  Other than that there are a lot better hedges against the dollar that haven't lost 60% of their value this year.


This is the same as remittance and its only true if you ignore the cost to acquire bitcoin, and keep the value in bitcoin.


Yup this is a benefit of bitcoin.


True, but given that almost every windows user has some form of malware on their computer it would be a lot easier to profit from the theft of 60 million private keys stolen off desktops.  Or addresses/qr codes swapped in browsers.

The difference is even with the problems it was still a better experience for everyone than the existing system.  This isn't true for bitcoin remittance.  The problems make it at best equal to the existing system cost wise with the added overhead of an additional currency conversion making it worse in simplicity.
If you have no incumbent technology/systems/processes you can get away with just about anything.  When you do have an incumbent though you can't just be a little bit better you have to blow them out of the water because you are also being charged switching costs.

China was meant to drive us to the next moon and lead to mainstream adoption around the world.  The chinese exchanges are busy because they are zero fee.  China as far as bitcoin is concerned fell off hard.  Flop.
If having big name investors was all it takes to be a successful company VC companies would have a lot higher returns.  Coinbase was launched as the easy way to acquire bitcoins and everyone talked about how this would drive adoption since everyone could get coins with ease.  That never materialized.  Flop.
When secondmarket first started getting involved in bitcoin everyone talked about how they would bring big wall st and how that would drive the price to the moon which would attract the mainstream.  Flop.
See Secondmarket.  See your own reply about Coinbase.  When they first started investing in bitcoin companies everyone was claiming that this was the mainstream adoption we needed.  Flop


BTMs were promised as an easy way for anyone to get bitcoin.  It was said that the difficulty in getting coins was the only limit and once they existed people would flock to them.  Almost two years later they exist all over the place now and well we still don't have everyone flocking.  Flop.
How new are you?  Cyprus was going to collapse and everyone there was going to switch to Bitcoin and it was going to be a crypto eden and the rest of the world would see it and be jealous and fall in line.  Flop.
People thought their claimed $200m investment would push the price up to new highs which would attract the mainstream.  A few months after they launched they announced a pull out of their banking partners and went radio silent.  You don't see how that is a flop?  Flop.
It was released like 6 months ago and how many times have you heard about it since?  The community is often very excited about projects like this until they go live then they miss expectations and flop.  Like Lighthouse.  Flop.
I don't expect overnight success but OpenBazaar has been around a lot longer than overnight.  Basic design failings basically guarantee it will never be a legitimate marketplace.  Flop.
You seriously don't remember how the easy remittance to Africa of bitcoins was going to lead to mainstream adoption?  Well it was the speaking point of for quite a long time.  Someone even travelled to Kenya to see the progress only to see failure.  Flop.
You don't see how the constantly falling sales over the course of their accepting it is a failure?  No one was expecting that they were expecting that Overstock accepting bitcoins would drive mainstream acceptance.  It hasn't and their sales in bitcoin keep shrinking.  Flop.
Same as Overstock a big name was coming in to save the day and the press would pick up on it and it would drive mainstream adoption as Joe Q Public saw them on board.  I believe the merchant adoption is actually falling off its just no one in the community updates their numbers to subtract companies that don't accept it any more.  Same way no one releases MAU/DAU.


We can say its flopped because it's been what a year and a half now with no progress and no sign of progress.  The whole thing is just a wait for the twins to divest themselves with minimal slippage.


That was pretty much what people thought.  They would get their $100 see how amazing it was and go all in on bitcoin tech.  Hardly anyone even took the $100 and nothing much has come from it.  Flop.


Because everyone expected these things to make bitcoin go mainstream and none of them has even come close.  Go to and search for those keywords and look at all the users posting to brag.  That is why they are flops.

Internet via satellite is only good for downloads.  It gets much more expensive when you start adding in requirements for uploads that aren't "use a dial up modem".  And a node that only downloads adds strain on the network it doesn't support it in any way.

All these cheap remittance solutions are cheap because they avoid the expensive part of remittance.  KYC and compliance.  Moving the money itself is cheap and using bitcoin to do it won't save on that.

I'm guessing you've never worked in online advertising/marketing if you believe that.  I don't believe there is $35m worth of data there, I think they paid a premium for some publicity for their ad platform but I believe there is a fair bit of value to be extracted from the data that is there.
All this is besides the point that even at their peak Myspaces primary business was using your data to sell ads.
Just checking and it appears Myspace still has 50m MAU and 300m pageviews a month so maybe they didn't over pay after all.
If Myspace will report MAU almost a decade after they started their decline it makes you wonder just how bad Coinbase/Blockchain/Circle/etc's numbers must be for them to still refuse to release those figures.

If you're getting them at a lower price than there is a spread between prices already which is what I described and that means the cost to remit would be higher.  Also you would have costs in transmitting your own funds to the country to buy the bitcoins with.  Which would mean either you demand lower prices above than the cost to just transmit existing currencies or you would be doing it for no gain.
Those spreads you see on forex don't require deliverability which is where the cost comes in.

Flattr launched in 2010.  TipJoy started in 2008 and closed its doors in 2009.  By my take that puts it about 5 years ahead of Changetip and it wasn't even the first.


It is relevant because none of them make money so funding is the only thing keeping them running.


The person being tipped is an user and the person doing the tipping one.  Like I said niche community.  Ask ChangeTip to tell you how many tips they have across different sites that aren't from their employees.  They'll tell you they can't release those figures due to competitive advantages which is bullshit since there is no competitive advantage to hiding it unless they are abysmal.  It's not taking off.

Remittance with bitcoin seems like the type of thing where popularity would end up making it less beneficial.  The more popular it becomes in a country the more the balance between supply and demand for bitcoin will tilt towards over supply dropping the price people will pay in that country for the coins and increasing the price of the remittances due to increased spread.  Arbing will happen but there is still the overhead of moving the coins to overseas exchanges and moving the funds back to the receiving country to keep the cycle going.
I guess we'll have to wait for one country to show real demand in this space though to see if a solution is found for this problem that keeps the costs down still and the remittance companies in business.

No, do you think switching to bitcoin would remove the need for a fraud department?


No but they would have had the audit for a security breach with or without the credit cards.  The only difference is now it is public and instead of losing all their money they lost some credit cards that the credit card company will replace.


My point is that for most businesses it really doesn't as the number of chargebacks is negligible.  If you have a chargeback rate anywhere near 1% you're going to start having difficulty from your processors.

So you thought it was going to go up over $1000 more per coin and yet you still offloaded a significant number of coins?  I don't buy it.
I don't fixate on it at all, I rarely comment on peoples losses unless they bring them up first.  And no jealousy here, unlike most of the people in this sub I'm not hard up financially hoping for luck to make me wealthy hence my original comment to BigMoneyGuy above.

You think staffing is their only expense?  They have multiple offices in expensive cities, with the dropping value of Bitcoin this year they are almost certainly losing out on almost every transaction they process due to time to resell and slippage,  they are sponsoring a lot of stuff,  and if you think they aren't frontloading those big deals in the clients favour you've never worked very high up in tech.  I am certain they've lost money to date on every deal with a billion+ company.
I wouldn't take your bet though since there are a number of VC with Bitcoin fetishes still who might reload them but I doubt they make it though the year without another round or a m&amp;a deal

There is like nothing in this comment that is true.


Using the block chain doesn't change the requirements for the company that has to act on the data.  It only changes where the data is stored.


That is literally almost nothing.   An API supporting 10 million users making a few requests a day could be run on a single server with almost no load.


You are still the central authority for trust though since you(or Maytag in this case) is the one actioning the information so they can just ignore the blockchain data if they want.  You're trusting them not to.  I have a feeling you don't know what game theory is and just tossed in in there to sound clever because it makes no sense in that context.

Quite often after a few rounds they do actually have control either in ownership or board seats or even just a contractual ability to deny acquisitions.  Situations like Facebook are super rare.  Situations where the investors kick out the founders are pretty common.  You're right about the second point though no VC is going to pull the plug this fast even if they are dumping buckets of cash into s black hole.  They would however skip the next round though and I'm guess bitpay will need at least one more round to survive.

They have almost certainly lost money on it just on the 10% hold alone.  Add on to that 50 devs for a week that they spent on building it and on going costs in supporting it.  Aside from that the CEO was telling everyone they'd do like 15-20m in sales and they hit maybe 3?  It's a small part of their income but missing an estimate like that by that much is going to make some investors ask questions and will drop the price of their stock.

These miners will be so low powered that getting a normal mining rig(even an out dated one) would allow you to bypass any mechanism that used this making it pointless.


With the drive towards energy ratings and conservation everywhere I just don't see this ever taking off.  Transparency in energy usage is very important these days.  I don't see any company willing to risk the negative publicity from including an energy waster in their devices.


I don't want to force myself to be in my house to use my online banking and this doesn't require the blockchain.  Public key encryption exists outside of the blockchain and would be just as effective as this without the overhead.


Why would I need a public database for this?  Assuming its all my devices communicating between themselves would a private communications protocol not be much more efficient?  Have a home server that stores everything.  No need to share the data publicly.


This is the same as point 2 as best I can tell.  Paying for services with electricity.


How does this enable this to happen?  Also how does the Chinese company know you're putting all the sales through this payment channel?  They still fully have to trust you only now you've added overhead to the process.


Poor people can't afford to spend extra money on electricity to generate bitcoins inefficiently.  I don't think targeting the poor with this will ever work but who knows on this one.

How much longer until you will admit we're no longer in this stage?  How long at the current size/usage would it take?


The first commercial ISP was launched in 1989.  6 years later in 1995 there were 16 million internet users.  6 years from the start of bitcoin how many users do you think there are?  The next year there was 36 million internet users.  Do you think the number of bitcoin users will grow by 34 million before the end of the year?
This is all ignoring the fact that the internet has increased the spread and growth of ideas a lot so comparing preinternet growth with post internet growth is silly.  Another fun point 15 years ago Paypal gained more users in 8 months than the bitcoin network has gained in 6 years.

I already explained all this so I'm going to skip most of the quoting this time.  Since we don't have mainstream adoption clearly China and Coinbase haven't lead to mainstream adoption.  In actual fact we are very far from it.  Go back and read the original post all these are things that were meant to push bitcoin into the mainstream.  It doesn't matter if they are successful in their own little ecosystem.  You're mostly arguing against something I haven't said.


Maybe you need to realize that a company doesn't have to be successful for a VC to get paid.  Or that VCs are in the business of making extremely risky bets.  They aren't extremely risky because they have a high chance of success.
Wall st is coming has been the rallying call for ages.  Sure there is wall st investment but it's not driving mainstream adoption and it certainly isnt thanks to Secondmarket.


I actually do expect that for a non-flop in a small community.  Because stuff gets quickly forgotten here after a few weeks.


But they did with Overstock and all the other major companies I've listed.  A lot of people did, regularly and constantly.

Probably because they stopped being popular long ago.  Flooz and Beenz though were the right era and were accepted by lots of major companies.

Before the last peak though there was virtually no publicity about bitcoin outside of geek/libertarian circles.  Around the run up there was basically a year of constant publicity and tons of changes to make it really easy to acquire and spend bitcoin that didn't exist before and still it hasn't caught on outside the same small circles.  It's dying because it's not attracting enough new people to deal with the attrition of the ones who have bought it over the past 18 months and are now losing money.

Selling into buy orders will instantly cost them in both the spread and slippage even if they are automated.  When price is dropping already an hour difference could cost you 2-3% before slippage.  This is in every same so your looking at a few million a year not 10s of thousands.  And that is assuming they are able to sell immediately.

1.  Seller offers a brand new XBox for 1BTC
2.  Buyer puts up 2BTC, Seller puts up 1BTC
3.  Seller sends a used XBox worth 0.75BTC
4.  Buyer can either:  
    a) Confirm the transaction and lose 0.25BTC  
    b) Refuse and lose 1.25BTC
The problem with this system is it assumes the buyer will always act for the social good instead of in their own financial best interest(which is to accept but minimize the loss instead of trying to punish the scammer).  This will almost never happen so the end result is the system is broken.

Yes, they must but they have to already.  Companies need to know who their investors are so you can't just transfer the shares to anyone.  Someone has to control that and the market has to agree on who is allowed to control that.  You can just let any third party do it since anyone could claim to be that third party.


Which they do already in the existing system.


Where?  It seems like a lot of your believed inflexibility doesn't actually exist and is only an issue with you not knowing about how the current systems work.

On 6 August 2010, a major vulnerability in the bitcoin protocol was spotted. Transactions weren't properly verified before they were included in the transaction log or "block chain" which let users bypass bitcoin's economic restrictions and create an indefinite number of bitcoins.

They were asking for credit cards on the internet 15 years ago.  People were hugely distrustful of giving their cards over the internet even then.  They were also processing $3.5 billion in transactions per year at that point.


This growth was all before eBay


Seriously?  For almost all uses cases they are the exact same experience for most people.  You add a credit card to a company(Paypal/Circle/Coinbase).  You fund your account for the second two the first one doesn't require this.  Then when you hit a website that accepts that form of payment you enter your account details, confirm the transaction on their page and you're done.
Bitcoin isn't introducing much change at all for users except the removal of consumer protections.  Maybe thats why its not taking off?


So you're saying we'll be in early adoptor stage until 2018?  If we're still around the same level of usage by that point what would your expectations be for the future? Also why 2018?  Is it just because its far enough off to be unaccountable?  If I'd asked you that same question ago in 2012 when Coinbase launched would you have said 2018 then or would you have said 2015?

Time wasted on discussing bitcoin is clearly too much over the years but I don't think its weird.  It's a community that is highly active so there is always discussion to be had and involves technology and finance which are two interests of mine.  Just because I don't believe bitcoin will ultimately be a huge success doesn't mean I can't find it interesting to talk about.  Unfortunately my attempts to stay focused on the technology or finance aspects are pretty much always side tracked these days by people like yourself or BigMoneyGuy who seem to want to focus on navel gazing instead but you take the bad with the good I guess.

They aren't purposely eating 2-3% it would be a result of the dropping price drying out demand.
As for your question about bootstrapping all that was done during a growth period in price where a slow sell would make them money and people would pay a premium to lock in a price.  2014 was a very different year.  Almost all Bitcoin companies today are designed to profit off the spread of an increasing coin value and when they fails they do.  As for VCs putting money in a company that burns a lot that is exactly what they do.  Look at Square they process many times as much as all of Bitcoin combined and they've raised more money than all Bitcoin companies combined and they are still losing tons.  VC people will accept losses for traction and growth.  Bitpay hasn't had growth in volume in 3/4ths of a year and that is why it will be difficult for them to raise money it an increasing burn rate.

SSL and public key encryption exist outside of bitcoin.  User certificates cover this use case.


What if you want to monitor your water usage through smart devices, should each company for every device now have to maintain a database for this information? And they all have to write a respective API that yet another company has to try and aggregate into another central database? And this data has to be handled securely by all parties?
You still need to develop a protocol that they all agree on to allow this so if you're going to do that you don't need the blockchain its just overhead and making your data public.  You also vastly overestimate the complexity and interoperability required for what you're suggestion.


Except it doesn't work for things that happen off the blockchain.  It will allow you to share the transactions on the blockchain securely but once something has to happen separate from it you introduce external trust and verification requirements back into the system.


Do you?  I worked for Morgan Stanley maybe a decade ago in ETL.  I'm pretty sure I have a much better idea of banking data transfer requirements and protocols than you and it's really not a problem that is solved by the blockchain.  All you're doing is moving the storage you still need protocols built on top the exact same as currently.


My guess is the Nasdaq stuff is a pet project of one of the senior executives and that it goes nowhere past the initial trial.


Go ahead an explain it then.   How is game theory relevant at all to your original sentence?


You still need to do that.  The blockchain offers a communication medium.  It doesn't offer a communication protocol.  Those still need to be built on top.  As I've said repeatedly.

Yes over a lifetime we've seen a huge drop.  That has stabilized into a state where we are at now where ROI and centralization mean the existing systems won't be replaced super quickly.
To my point because the units won't be shipping all at once the effect on hash rate growth will be negligible as many small operators turn on small numbers of units.

You know how easy it is to increase the transaction size?  It's been openly done a few times recently by inept members of this subreddit that is how easy it is.  
VC funding has stalled there have only been 5 deals this quarter.  Outside of a few unicorns in Q1/Q2 there was very little investment and there aren't any unicorns left.
Number of related businesses is up?  What do you consider a related business. Businesses accepting Bitcoin only looks up because no one removes the companies that aren't from coin map.  The number of posts here about showing up somewhere and them no longer accepting it and the number of websites removing it as an option should tell you merchant adoption is definitely not up.

You don't have to I calculated the $1-2 with no fees.  Obviously in real life you're saving even less.


It's the same for me with credit cards.  But you're ignoring the actions you take every time you want to buy something to get the bitcoin in the first place.  So 2 clicks to pay is being dishonest here.


It doesn't matter how you have access to bitcoin on your devices.  You're doing a currency exchange before purchase.  That is a lot of effort for very little savings.


Right I'm sure you have a massive and complex financial situation what with your willingness to perform a number of extra steps each day to save $1.  Also this `I have never had enough money to buy and save Bitcoin.`.

Say you have your money invested 'safely' returning 5% subtract 3 for inflation and your making $10,000 a year but spending $24,000 so your eating into your principal at $2000 a month.  That means each year you'll make less and the number will drop faster.  I haven't even accounted for taxes on that 5% either.

Spam.  You should know by now that transactions mean fuck all.


New miners + centralization this also is no indication of usage growth.  The hash rate went up all through 2014 while usage definitely shrunk.


Almost all the VC investment this year has been in a handful of unicorn deals.  The general deal pipeline has dried up.  We're half way through Q3 with only 3 deals.


There have also been a large number of bitcoin companies going out of business this year.


I don't even know what you're trying to say here.


We're actually lower than the price over the first two weeks of January.

If it took you 5 days to send an international wire you need s new bank.  I send at least one sometimes a few each month and as long as I get it in by the close of business it is at the destination at the start of business the next day. That is usually way less than 24 hours.  Also much quicker than it would take to find someone in Australia that had $100k of Bitcoin to sell and someone in the uk willing to buy $100k without suffering horrible dlippage on either side.
It wouldn't have helped in Greece since you couldn't spend your money so buying $100k of Bitcoin would have been impossible and if you already had the cash you could just drive out of the country with it.

Even at $5000 you'll be better off with a bank transfer which would be &lt;1%.  If your bank is trying to fuck you on the spread and you have enough money to regularly wire 6 figures you really need to be changing banks.

I used to play [buzzword bingo]( during the dotcom boom.  Next you'll be telling me about how bitcoin creates like a total financial synergy.
The internet made it so that stuff moves a lot faster through society.  Which obviously is why people here comparing bitcoin to the internet are stupid.  The internet sped up the distribution of knowledge so pre internet was a hugely different world.  Look at the growth rate of new technology and services(even finance ones).  It's fucking fast.  Bitcoin isn't(but hello venmo, transferwise, xoom, paypal, etc, etc).  Bitcoin peaked two years ago with user figures AFAIK.  MtGox and a multiyear bear market drove off a lot of people, nothing has brought them back.  The rapid falloff of interest from customers drove off a lot of merchants.  Look at Overstock which is the darling of the bitcoin space.  They have literally lost ~$200,000 from their acceptance of bitcoin.  And that is just from their attempt to hold.  I believe if you include their integration costs(50 devs in a room for a month) it is a lot higher.
Bitcoin is interesting.  But interesting doesn't mean it's going to be a game changer.
I've said this before multiple times here and I'll give you your chance to dispute it.  The only use case in which bitcoin can beat traditional payment systems is in the payment for drugs/illicit merchandise.

Depending on how you develop it you can be just as confident with a permissioned ledger.  Remember with bitcoin you're putting control over the future of the system in a third parties hands and you don't know how it will progress.

No consumers want irreversible transactions.  That isn't a pro that is a con.
You can't do that for under $10 if you need to buy the Bitcoin.  In that case it would be much cheaper and faster to just use a wire or transfer wise, etc.  as for micro transactions much like with irreversible transactions no one wants them which is why every company that tries ends up going out of business fairly quickly.  Given the choice between paying $10 month or $0.10 an article almost everyone will pick the $10 so they don't have to think about usage even if it is regularly more expensive.

1) no one uses lighthouse it failed.

When you actually compare it to other fintech projects in various fields it doesn't come close to being equal and best case scenario in a lot of fields is something that is a bit worse than the competition.

I lived there the past 8 months and pretty much hated it after the first two months.  If living cheaply is your only concern it is great(though we didn't live very cheaply for CM even without drinking it was still cheap for us).  Otherwise it kind of sucks.
We paid 35,000 baht a month for our place + electric and water.  It came with wifi in the building which was pretty good.
Everywhere was dirty, you felt like you'd see a scene out of final destination every day(lots of insanely dangerous near death things happening all over the place), anything not made in Thailand tends to be a lot more expensive, market food is cheap but boring.

@_date: 2015-08-06 04:32:17
I don't see why this figure is promoted so heavily.  It isn't a positive when mixed with users other estimates(number of users).  Given people are estimating like 5-10 million users.  That means the average bitcoin user is investing less than $50 per year in bitcoin.  Even if you go with a more realistic number like 1m users that is less than $365 a year on average people are investing.  Given things like bitcoinone, bit, etc buying fairly large amounts this means most users aren't putting any new money into bitcoin.  If you can't even convince your current users to invest more how is this a good thing?

Bitcoin stalled growing quite a while ago.  It definitely is failing.  It definitely has peaked.  
3 years ago it wasn't popular because there was nothing to spend it on, then there was.  Then it wasn't popular because it was hard to buy but then Coinbase and circle appeared.  Then it wasn't popular because it was hard to store then there was trezor.  The excuses have been exhausted.  Face it, Bitcoin isn't popular because it's worse than the existing solutions for every use case except buying drugs on the Internet.  In person payments are better with debit cards and pay pass or care for privacy.  Internet payments are better with credit cards or PayPal which offer the same(or lower) costs to the customer with the added bonus of consumer protections.  Remittances are only cheaper right now because of loss leading and using other companies infrastructure.  Both things that stop being possible if it gets popular.  Also accounting for spread on buys it can often be more expensive than traditional methods.

The author [Martin Tiller runs a scam company](


This isn't a good thing.  I'm not anti-bitcoin but I don't think it will be successful so I'm generally on the other side of conversations here.  I've largely stopped paying attention to the bitcoin world because nothing has happened in over a year so it is the same conversations repeated.  It's boring.  There is no progress being made, nothing new happening just the same people writing the same things and the same results(no success).  
The subreddit is mostly just full of people posting the same insane rants about how it is on the verge of taking over the world despite there being no progress in that regard.  Look at all the people talking about how NYC is going to be the next Detroit because of the bitlicense and tell me you feel like you're on the sane side.  
That type of crazy isn't even worth arguing with.


The last part is the important part.  Banks largely aren't endorsing bitcoin(BBVA being the exception).  A few finance companies are but they are generally the asset agnostic ones(Nasdaq, NYSE).  The others are all talking about blockchains.


Bit banks haven't given a fuck about bitcoin let alone tried to discredit it.
The rest is fluff.
@_date: 2015-08-08 21:50:14
Bitcoin isn't a great solution for anyone but speculators.  
For first world internet purchasing it lacks consumer protections.  
For first world in person purchasing it lacks consumer protections and is slow.  
For first world p2p transfers most countries already have pretty good almost free interbank transfers.  The US is way behind on banking technology but there people can use Paypal/Venmo/etc for free without having to add 2 more currency conversions in the middle.
For third world, people often aren't in a position to be able to risk buying a speculative currency.  Also spotty internet means your money could be unusable for extended periods of time randomly.
For remittance the actual movement of money isn't the expensive part.   The only reason bitcoin remittance companies are currently cheaper in some cases is because they are small enough to use third parties services without flagging themselves for fees.  They also typically lack the reach of the more expensive companies.
Bitcoin is interesting but it pretty much sucks for everything except buying drugs online.
@_date: 2015-08-21 20:24:37
Those are the things bitcoiners Dream of because it's clear it is a failed project and they are grasping for straws.  DACs have been coming soon for 3 years.  The type of contracts you're talking about wouldn't reduce fees because you still need an expert to write them unless they are easily repeatable in which case they are like will kits.  Ignoring the fact that no one in business wants stone solid unchangable contracts.  They are also shit at enforcing anything off gain which dramatically reduces their scope of usefulness.
There are some interesting use cases for block gains but Bitcoin isn't going to be the winner.  It has a bad name,  and is too generalized to be useful without too much overhead.

This is something people post here a lot.  Basically what you're saying is that in the perfect future everyone will use one or two stores that you trust so Bitcoin doesn't need consumer protection.

It's almost certainly not worth the effort for a legitimate company to have so many small investors on the books before they actually go public.  Small investors are PITA since they are overly demanding for the amount they have invested.  They are also more likely to expect great returns and miscalculate risk.
If you don't have enough to qualify as an accredited investor you're probably not going to want to invest enough to make it worth it.  A $1000 investment is almost never worth the overhead.

The fact that you think the number of exchanges matters says a lot about your argument.  Most all of those have no volume outside of bots trading between themselves.

Changetip works but it isn't used much.  What does 'volume is a long term gig' even mean?  Volume is dropping there.  Has been for quite some time.  Traction is shit which is why they keep delaying fees.
And they aren't panning out because Bitcoin is failing.  
Like who?  You keep saying people are interested but the fact that they aren't using it says otherwise.  There are plenty if services that offer similar services for similar fees without the fear that a virus could steal all their money in an unrecoverable way.
@_date: 2015-08-25 04:14:49
No one does but the existing platforms handle this just fine without added complexity.  Bitcoin in the best case scenario here will catch up to the existing systems but not improve on it.  And you need to hope the person you are dealing with will accept your choice of third parties.  But seriously when as a consumer have you ever gone...'gee I wish this transaction was irreversible!'?
Yes but that fee is frequently higher than the individual fees through other systems so again best case scenario Bitcoin catches up.
All of those are easily handled with subscriptions and token packs.  One of my companies is basically just a middleman for other companies APIs and the existing payment methods have never been a problem.  I either pay a flat rate monthly, but token packs, or it's free.  The only people who could possible want micro transactions for an API are those who are using it so rarely they won't be spending enough to spend manpower in implementing a micropayments system.

The fact is in the bitcoin world at the moment there is a strong trend for every failure to be dismissed with "It's not a failure you're just looking at too short of a time scale".  The time scale you should be looking at is either absurdly long(if it takes another 15 years for Bitcoin to take off it isn't taking off) or absent.

So yes cheap coins.  DCA is for idiots.  It's pretty much the worst way to invest unless the asset is constantly dropping in price in which case who gives s fuck it's an asset that is constantly dropping in price.

Running an exchange won't fix an oversupply in country.  Once you require arb you require the arbers to move move currency into the country via traditional means since they need to pay in local currency to be useful to the remittance companies.  If the company does its own selling it also needs to increase fees to handle fluctuations in price and cover the costs of hedging.  It is workable for free at small volume because none of this matters.  Add volume dramatically increase problems, cost, and risk.
It has the potential to but the people recieving remits won't want anything but local currency or maybe Usd for a very long time if ever.

But why would you care about that as s consumer?  You wouldn't you wouldn't you would want that ability. It is the merchant that wants no chargebacks but they also want customers so they use what they want and that is a system with chargebacks.
Yes but you have to find them then negotiate with the merchant to agree on them then contact them to set it up.  Why go though all that hassle when the existing systems just work.  What you've described isn't an improvement for anyone except people that want to be escrow agents.
I didn't say pay me.  I said pay to develop.  Unless you're really bad at business you will understand opportunity cost and why it is a bad investment having your delivers implant a payment system just to cater to users who use your system too infrequently to warrant a subscription or we too cheap to buy tokens.

If you don't understand why VCs aren't investing directly in Bitcoin than you have a lot of reading about VC to do. :)
VCs raise funds from other investors with an outline like "we'll invest in early stage social companies" then they do that.  They don't want assets they want exits.  Buying assets with the fund would be a huge breach of trust and pretty much ensure that VC never raised another fund again.  Also the potential ROI is going to be lower investing in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is about as collectable as a failed currency as 90s baseball cards.  There are just too many of them and too many people convinced they will at some point be worth a lot(and not throwing them away) too ever make them truly collectible.


Depends who is behind the alt coin, what kind of community/ability to motivate people they have.

it's the same for Bitcoin due to oversupply in net reciever markets leading to warped spreads that fall back on traditional banking to correct when you try to arb.

I was actually referring to user growth.
The internet became GA around the mid-nineties so you should be comparing it to 99/2000 if you want to do the years from availability thing.  But you're not.  You're going to compare it to the mid nineties because it looks better.


Coindesk thought so at the end of Q1 because they saw two huge investments and extrapolated.  They now estimate ~750m by doing the same thing after Q2.  In likelyhood it will be 500m by end of Q3 since we've not really seen any big rounds this quarter and there aren't really anymore unicorns left to raise unless Bitpay is just pretending to be a failure.
Look at user demand.  It's flatlining.  No one cares about Bitcoin it was a big thing 2 years ago.  Now it is just a few VCs with blindspots(we all have them) chasing the dream.  These are the same people that though beenz and flooz were going to replace usd online too though.

The market size is tiny.  You would not be able to borrow enough to make a profit given the cost of spamming the network with high enough fees to make it unusable for most people.  Even spreading your trades across multiple markets.  And upping the demand like that would seriously increase your cost of options as well.
You would also have to believe that the markets would still be operational after your attack ruined the price completely.  Given how heavily invested in bitcoin most all of them are its likely they would almost all bust or "get hacked" if such a thing happened.
The only reason to do it is if you are worried about the network and want to make it unusable.

Thanks for the detailed explanation.  The effort is great.

You should probably get some fresh legal advice on this one because it sounds like you're a bit confused with who controls what.  The franchising is for the issuing of cards/collecting of payments/paying of merchants.  The network is still the CC companies though.  So they don't have to convince all issuing banks, they just have to tell you that your service isn't allowed to operate over their network and they almost certainly will do this as soon as they find out about you.

So this is done by Bitcoin direct LLC which released a press release to say they were selling 51% of their company to "Conexus Cattle Corp" which is a pink sheets company with a market cap of $21,000.  Of course the value of the shares they gave Bitcoin direct for control was $500,000(somehow?!).
So Bitcoin direct in an effort to get themselves trading did a reverse take over of a defunct cattle company which I could apparently buy a majority stake in with my monthly rent lol.

WU has a lot more to fear from Transferwise than they do from Bitcoin.

Congrats, you should do a search for coinbase in sometime to see how many people didn't share your easy experience.


Reduced fees from where?  You're still using the same systems so you still have to pay them the same fees.
Resistance to censorship is such a niche offering and the DNMs already cover it pretty well.  Also if you're using coinbase or circle for this purpose you're going to have a bad time.


Which will be awesome.  As we've seen at bitcoin merchants over the past 18 months when everyone expects their bitcoins to be worth more in a month they all rush out to spend them.


You guess wrong.  Don't think that just because I don't think bitcoin will be any more successful I'm stupid or ignorant of the topics.

I'd say his belief that travelling across country by train with $18,000 to LA to "make a music video" made him stupid.  Why was he carrying cash for that?  There are about a million better ways to get the money there or access the money once there.
There is no mention of it but I imagine he wasn't able to give feds any details of who he was planning to see to make this movie once he arrived either.

It wasn't that the rendition of the products was bad it was that it is a LOT more efficient to browse a store on a flat web page then to wander around in a virtual environment.

1) What honestly makes you think this?  You keep saying it but you have no reason to other than your love of bitcoin(which very few people share).  
2)  If you use encryption no.  Otherwise yes.  
3) Well the idea is you have a monopoly in an area so once.  And why not?  Unlike with bitcoin where they could take your coins and not provide a service with a credit card you can get a charge back.  
4) Bitcoin isn't going to be doing anything.  You've been telling me about how bitcoin is going to do awesome stuff for over a year now.

This was the ISP one I was trying to remember.  There have been a few attempts at not ISP based ones that should be easy to find though they are all defunct these days.


Luckily with credit cards it doesn't matter because of chargebacks and the ability to cancel cards.  Unlike bitcoin where a hack means losing all your money permanently. 


All the growth is in vanity metrics.  Like the front page posts here today about the number of subscribers while down voting every comment pointing out that monthly unique users has been dropping for 2 years.
That is the one.  I said it has been tried before and not used except in special cases because it is a pain.  You said I was thinking of SSL and that this was different because it was authentication.   I explained client side certs to you and how they are the same thing as bitid.  You disagreed.   There was no going in circles there was just you not understanding and trying to tell me I was talking about ssl.

Equivalent would be if uber was somehow using existing taxis without their knowledge/agreement.  Or maybe just their dispatch networks.  I don't think this company is breaking any laws yet but they could be if visa/mc decided so.
And I wouldn't say I'm kicking or screaming just offering a heads up.  It's quite common in business for people to have blind spots or misunderstandings that they never think about until someone random brings it up. In this case they've misunderstood the cc companies rights and believe it would be a lot more difficult for them to block them out than it would be.  hopefully they think about it now and can come up with a plan with their legal council.

These are both the same thing you are just calling them different.  A true mesh network wouldn't be usable for what you want since congestion would make transmitting your normal data impossible.

Do you even have 200 coins at the moment?  Can you prove it?
With that said.  The way you're planning to do this "Post thread, gather people, Business!" is about the worst way to go about this thing and pretty much guaranteed to fail.  The only people who would be interested in taking part in a venture formed this way are pretty much people that you don't want(I suspect yourself included judging by your need for basically every skill).
What skills do you have?  $27k isn't going to go far in building out a full site when you have to hire everyone.  I worked on a dating site for a few months about 8-9 years ago and they blew through ~$100k building the site(developers, designers) after trying to use various off the shelf solutions for a year which couldn't scale past 50 users or so.  Then they dropped another $500k on advertising campaigns to get users.  They still didn't find enough traction to get unpaid for members and ran out of money.
In dating these days you pretty much have to start as not a dating site(okcupid) or you have to pay $3-4 for every paying customer(Match/etc).  Most of them will quit before you recoup that for a long time.

Alternatively I could download the OB client, buy bitcoin from coinbase and hope they don't cancel my order, I will also have to buy more in case the exchange rate changes while I'm waiting(replace coinbase with any other method), then I have to hope the OB store I'm buying from isn't going to scam me because I have no way to get my money back if they do.

If you're going to say that you probably shouldn't link to a situation where they were able to do something about it as an example.
Also all of these cases that you hear about have one thing in common.  None of the people have ways to show that they earned the money which is why it is so difficult for them to get it back.  If you go to the bank and take out $100k and get pulled over you say "I just took it out of my bank account" and nothing happens since they have a trail.
It's a shit system and I'm completely opposed to it(and glad to see numerous states taking stands against it) but it's not like if you take out $10k from your bank to buy a car you're at any risk of losing it.

Unless you want to sell illegal things that doesn't matter and consumers don't care about that.


This will only ever benefit the seller.  Again customers won't care.


Which comes at the cost of more difficult or missing consumer protection.  Real escrow and arbitration isn't cheap because it's not easy.  Also its easy for a customer to prove they have paid its difficult for a merchant to prove they have sent something so arbitration will almost always side with the buyer meaning sellers will need to once again implement a markup to cover those losses.  Or they could force people to use merchant friendly arbitrators but those won't last long.

I'm not against bitcoin, it's technology and interesting technology at that.  But I don't think it is going to find mainstream adoption ever and I'm pretty certain it has peaked already.

Bitcoin has flatlined for 1/3rd of its existence.  It had a chance like that but because of its many failings it never will be there.

Since you seemed to have missed it last time "Did it never occur to you that instead of blowing up the buildings they could have just NOT had the press conference?"
Also he wasn't lying the reports on the money were released during the next year or two.  If you actually cared you would have found them already but you don't.  You are content to follow what others say if it is a narrative you like.  It's not surprising you're into bitcoin or that you paid $1200 for coins.  You're a sheep.
@_date: 2015-07-25 18:16:35
The number on the y axis tell you how many coins would need to be bought/sold to reach the price on the x axis.
So on that one we can see it would take a bit more than 200 coins sold to push the price down to $286.  Then it would take another 400 coins to push it past that point.  So someone has a sell order at just under $286 for ~400 coins.
Though volume changes in relation to sells so those numbers aren't actually right.  That 400 coin wall could be removed at anytime as could any other other meaning it might only take 100 coins to go to $285.

Civil forfeiture happens when someone has no legal explanation for how they came across the money they did.  Everyone working legally and getting paid will have tax history, invoices for clients, etc.

Unless they are paying them next to nothing once you calculate in spread on buying it and spread on selling it plus any fees depending on where you get it you are often paying more than traditional banking.  For your foreign suppliers the more popular it gets in their countries the higher the spread will move and the more expensive it will be for them to accept money in bitcoin.

Almost everyone.  They will know how to use it but not how it works.
How does a differential work?  How does an automatic transmission work?
You think most people could answer that?
Cell phones, how does it communicate with a tower,  how/why does it work through walls?
Most people aren't going to answer that.
The internet: what is a backbone?  What are the layers of tcp/ip and what do each of them do?  What are the most commonly used protocols on the internet and what do they do?  How does your data know how to get to another computer on the internet?
Same with those.
In each of those fields those are really basic questions that everyone would know.  But outside of those fields almost no one is answering any of those questions.
@_date: 2015-07-21 22:54:40


You offered a centralized solution to the problem so that is what we are talking about.


I mean all the people who regularly have orders cancelled or their accounts cancelled for shopping with merchants coinbase doesn't approve of.


You can keep saying that the fees are the same, but that's simply not true. You're being very dishonest.
Yes because you're using ACH.  If you use Paypal with ACH you'll pay similar fees.  If they have to go to your card you'll pay more because you're using the existing system.  See Circle and the magic fees everyone was surprised to get when they started using credit cards for buys.


The fact that some have been busted doesn't mean they aren't censorship resistant.  Do you think OB will somehow stop people doing illegal things from being busted?


Until you run out of coins.


Yes, I'm sure you've swiftly moved down from $1000/coin.

1. Ok so add more to fees.  Also the fact that you can use a traditional VPN says you're not actually a mesh network anymore you're sharing a trucked connection.  
2.  Because most peoples home connections are slow.  Add on a few more people sharing and it's very slow.

Coinbase and Blockchain refuse to release MAU numbers which are more indicative of actual usage.  User accounts and number of wallets are vanity numbers in that they will always grow no matter how bad your retention is.  Also neither require users to be unique.  I have multiple coinbase accounts(not sure on wallets I haven't logged into any of them in over a year) and a few blockchain wallets.
Given how often they are used as signs of growth I have no doubt at least one person has a bot going automating signups for the services.

So this is done by Bitcoin direct LLC which released a press release to say they were selling 51% of their company to "Conexus Cattle Corp" which is a pink sheets company with a market cap of $21,000.  Of course the value of the shares they gave Bitcoin direct for control was $500,000(somehow?!).
So Bitcoin direct in an effort to get themselves trading did a reverse take over of a defunct cattle company which I could apparently buy a majority stake in with my monthly rent lol.

Overstock said they had something like 50+ developers working on the integration for a few weeks.

Safe from theft - There was a post today about how everyone on windows had to patch their computer immediately since going to the wrong website could cause their computer to be hacked which if they had a bitcoin wallet on it could lead to the absolute unrecoverable loss of their coins.  Also no consumer protections leads to things like butterfly labs.  Look at how the people using credit cards did vs those that paid with bitcoins in that scenario.

Bitcoin saved my ass because I couldn't figure out how to make a free collect call to my bank.
Did you tell your bank you were travelling before you left?  If not then odds are your difficulty in getting it resolved would have been calling, telling them it's locked, answered 2 security questions and confirming one or two charges on your card.  They'll probably also tell you that next time you travel you should put on a travel note.
Bitcoin only saved your ass because you went out of your way to make it the only option.

Instant purchase using the existing banking system where they have to pay the fees with the added risk that once you send money from your account they can't recover it so they are a lot more of a hassle to setup and get going(and keep going) than paypal or just credit cards.
Also if all they are doing is adding another layer between you and the store
How is that going to be cheaper than just using a credit card?
Then we go to the "Well stores have more freedom to work in fields that credit cards won't support" but as we've seen both Coinbase and Circle are quick to shut down users for sending coins to people offering those things as well so there isn't even an improvement there.

That's a fun question.  I'm not sure how it would be resolved since the new difficulty would be too high for any more blocks to be mined so it would obviously require a fork.  How would it work though, would it be fair to that very lucky person to have all their coins rejected by the network?  Not really but I think that would probably be the only real option.  Though I suppose you could rewrite the difficulty calculation to just strip 1m coins off the top.  
Though should someone ever mine 1m coins in one day I'm pretty sure everyone would assume it was a new unknown attack and confidence would drop like a rock.  What happens then?  How many people would still be trying to buy up as many coins as possible, I'm sure there would be quite a few from here.  Though this situation is never going to happen.

Likely because they couldn't pinpoint any single person doing something specifically illegal.  It's more like a bunch of people doing things that aren't illegal but eventually lead to a crime.  In this case the money laundering wasn't the bank doing actual laundering.  It was that they had a massive backlog in processing their reports on suspicious transfers.  They were still doing it, they were just doing it at a slower rate than they were getting new ones.  Sounds more like understaffing than a criminal action.

Except at large retailers which can get lower fees.  


So smaller retailers won't be able to sell anything without depending on a larger one to handle the transaction and verify them?  So back to centralization again?

How would a bitcoin card that let you spend at any Bitcoin merchant handle a chargeback?  They can't escrow the funds since that would require them to sign the merchant up to their program and accept that escrow for payments from their customers.  They would have to pay the customer back out of their own funds and hope they could make enough of a case to collect from the merchant.  They would be out of business due to fraud in week.

It also isn't a good solution for the person that designed that poorly architected solution since the additional management overhead of monitoring, and maintaining multiple database servers is much higher than just a single one with a default configuration(which any junior developer can do).

If property is bought with the idea to sell it for a higher price, the person who is stuck owning the property is the bagholder.
Replace property with bitcoin and that is the definition they are using.  And honestly it fits for a lot of people at that have bought over the past 2 years.  That isn't to say the price won't go up in bitcoin or the property but that future possibility doesn't change the fact that they are currently bag holders.

Yes that doesn't make its inefficiency not a crippling blow though.
It isn't more equitable.  The people that invested in Bitcoin early and stand to become rich were all largely already rich by world standards.  The people that are already rich aren't going to stop being rich either since they aren't invested in currency so changing the dominant one won't matter.  Also should it look like it will be a success a millionaire can buy a lot more $5000 coins than you can buy $200 coins so it's not like the balance of power will really shift at all.

Get a clue.  The current internet as we know it is very different from the early attempts which did fail because of their inefficiencies or inability to scale.  Seriously the issue isn't that we can't transport lots of data or that we can't transport more in the future it is straight up that the overhead per transaction with bitcoin makes it ill suited to do so.  Sure we can keep increasing the block size but that doesn't improve the overhead in any way.

You're overestimating the computational complexity.  I could set up a functional private blockchain on 3 old HP laptops.  And if I was a high volume user I would save more than the cost of transaction fees and acquiring bitcoin on day one.

No the chains would split almost immediately based on geographical location.  Most of the mining power is in China which would be cut off meaning the other chains might take weeks to mine blocks and it might take years for a difficulty change unless one was forced in the code and honestly once it gets to that point people will have better things to do than debate about bitcoin and it'll die.

Network effect these days.  In the early days luck and a lack of alternatives they could run themselves.  Those alternatives have been easily accessible now for over a decade though Amazon and eBay are still here.


Right so first you limit your total userbase to the very tiny population of bitcoin holders.  Where even optimistic estimates put it at ~2m.  Then you have to subtract all the holders which is almost certainly at least half so we're down to 1m possible users best case.  But we haven't even cut the people that do hold it but aren't involved in the community so wouldn't have heard of OB so less than a million and then you have to remove the vast majority of users who are never going to install 3rd party software just to do something they can already do though their browser and you're left with almost no one.
And thats just the buy side.  The sell side needs to invest time and effort into selling on it and why would they with such a limited userbase?


No one cares about censorship(well some do but they are a rounding error),  eBay and Amazon can charge the fees they do because they provide a ton of value in the form of customers.  The internet deadpool is littered with the corpses of companies whose only plan was to beat one of those on fees.  And I don't know if you've not used eBay or Amazon before but you can definitely do international transactions on both.


Yes the market decides and I'm just saying what the market will decide.  I don't have to be a psychic either because their value prop is stupid.


So a centralized trust source that will obviously need to charge for their services?  So why replace the existing ones at all if you're just going to trade known ones for some random start up?


Google is still quite poor when using it to find goods sold by bitcoin merchants. (Especially of the type sold in the second-hand market)
No they used Google to increase traffic they weren't competing with it.  
So the marketspace for OB is now second hand sellers who only want bitcoin?  Seems very niche.


Because they have lots of customers.


Right 7 years ago bitcoin was worse by every metric in all use cases.  Today it is worse by every metric in all use cases(except drugs/extortion).  Today OB is worse than all existing systems.  But it needs to be better than them to attract users to allow it to be useful.  Very few people are going to spend more than a few minutes time shopping on a platform that is worse than the existing systems just because it accepts bitcoin.


That is your own blindness then because I have listed quite a few.

The problem with changetip is that no one outside the bitcoin community wants to tip.  Changetip is far from the first to try.  The others all discovered the same thing though that it is a business model without demand.
Changetip keeps trying to hide this by adding more and more social networks but they all go the same way they get a short boost from people in this subreddit because 'its going to be huge and drive adoption' then everyone moves on and that network is left with only changetip employees spamming tips.

Problem: Manufacturers want to know how much/when/where their products are selling for.
Solution A: They poll their retail/distribution partners(easy, already done)  
Solution B: They build an API so that POS systems can automatically tell them at purchase time then hope retailers turn it on(difficult not likely to have much traction won't add much over the above)  
Solution C: They build a system to monitor the blockchain for transactions matching a specific pattern AND convince POS systems to implement a way to write to the block chain AND hope retailers turn it on(and are willing to pay a transaction fee for every item purchased in their store and hope that all the stores on the network don't sell more that 3 things per second) (seriously?)

Problem:  You want to prove ownership of a product

So you think no one at all would try to mine on their local chain?  It would be pointless because of difficulty but lots of idiots run -EV miners even today.  If the military has gone to those lengths to cut the internet out you can be fairly certain they aren't restoring it anytime soon and in that case who gives a fuck what the other chains are doing they are of no consequence to you.
All this is pointless though because if the theoretical situation happened no one would care about bitcoin anyhow.  A currency that requires a network connection would be dead in the water.

Why does it matter if they have committed fraud?  How would you use this system to defraud?  You would in most cases be trading/settling debt.  The only thing they could do is not have a means to settle which since it's a known entity could be settled in the courts.
Mining presents a cost to fraud where you don't know the participants.  That is all.  It is a shitty inefficient system but it is required because of that one constraint.  Once you remove it you remove the need.

That isn't actually true through.  Bitcoin itself is terribly inefficient so the only way to get the volume you need for your dream is to not actually use it like with side chains.  In which case what's the point?
No Bitcoin will not be what you dream because it can't be.  Even ignoring the fact that 7 years in and it has seen almost no mainstream adoption leading anyone not invested to conclude that not only can't it do that but no one really wants to use it for that.

They sell on Amazon because that is where all the customers are it has nothing to do with infrastructure.  Same with eBay.  These are things OB cannot offer because not only is it a new system it is a marketplace that requires you to download and install new software.
You say quick and easy I say unavailable by default to all users.  They don't handle disputes you have to negotiate with each store individually on every purchase to chose an acceptable escrow agent(no one wants this), their solution to reputation is easily gamed according to their new reputation system paper and they aren't near competing with Google on search.  They are worse by every metric which is why they will fail.

The asset can be variable in type by nature(each issuer would issue their own type).
Yes off chain settlement of assets would occur though ideally the network would include methods to cross trade assets back to their originator to minimize required settlements or difficulty of settlement. 
Bank a has s customer that wants to send $10 to their friend at bank C.  Normally what would happen is they'd send a request to bank c then either directly or through a clearing bank they would give bank c money.
In the new system they could say hey bank b you owe bank c and we owe you so bank a sends bank b $10 in c-tokens, bank b sends bank a $10 in a-tokens completing the settlement requirements between those two.  Bank b then sends bank c $10 in c-tokens and bank c sends bank b back the $10 in b-tokens it holds settling that account too.  Bank a has passed $10 to bank c but because of debt settling no actual money money hands.
That's obviously a very simple example but larger network settlements like that would basically remove the need for clearance banks or complex EOD settlement requirements.   The end result is very fast movement of money within the network for the banks and their customers.

2. Because those mechanisms aren't important to a blockchain they are important to s public blockchain
3. On a single system no but once you add in the need for distributed replication they are comparable to most all top tier rdbms because I can set the block time and size to what I want as long as my whole network has the bandwidth there is no reason for it to lag behind the only difference is one is likely streaming while the other is batched

because no off the shelf solution will have all the features you need(consistency of ordering is a big one) and they get really hard to manage once you have multiple organizations with a master so you'll end up building  adhoc  solutions around your database to ensure consistency, deal with conflicts etc.  At this point you've developed a blockchain on top of your existing off the shelf database which adds nothing but overhead.  You might as well just save the effort and use a system designed from the ground up for that purpose.

In a year it has 10x the number of merchants as Bitcoin has gained in 7 and one of those merchants does over $30m in payments a year through it.  Bitcoins largest merchant payment processor only did 5x that in all of 2014 and they claimed to have over 60,000 merchants at the time.  Just notice whole foods saying 2% of their payments are through it so that's another $300 million or so and you have 2 merchants alone with double all the payments going through bitpay last year.
When it comes to retail payments Apple Pay is doing poorly yet it has still blown away the Bitcoin retail figures.  This should give you some indication of just how bad Bitcoin is doing.

If you're going to limit how much power each member can have you would have the same effect limiting it to 0.  If you don't you end up with an inefficient system. In a private chain you want everyone to be able to write equally so a round robin system works way better.  Pow stops a single entity from controlling the chain but it's not the only way and it's far from the best way in a private chain.
Pow on a private chain removes 0 attack vectors.

Almost every ATM charges 5-8%. LBC will often cost you over 20% if you live outside a large city with a lot of sellers.  Unless you're willing to transfer money to an exchange and buy it there where you might get a lower rate but if you're going to do that then you should be comparing it to the cost of forex exchanges and not your bank.

You obviously understand spreads right?  So even if the markets were balanced you'd still require positive movement in the price to make that ever possible.  You'd need that(an increase in price at the destination) for every transaction.  That is why your plan isn't workable.
This unbalance is also why Bitcoin remittance will only be cheaper while it is rarely used.  If it became popular sell demand in the popular receiving countries would go up, prices there would drop and the spread would rapidly increase above fees of even the expensive services like WU.  Arb doesn't solve it either since the arbers have to move their money outside the system so they will need to cover the costs of the traditional methods.

This is a case of bad sourcing which isn't surprising here.
The 68 million number comes from a USPS report and says 68 million are underserved scrolling down the report to see what underserved means we see just 8% of them are unbanked which brings the number down to 5.4m. Of those a bit under half are unbanked because they don't trust banks or don't want a bank.  Those people aren't going to use Bitcoin.  31% are unbanked because they don't have enough money to have a bank account.  Those people are too poor to be trusting their funds in a speculative asset.  So that leaves about a million people that are going to maybe be eligible though given the other reason(owe too much, bad credit, bank closed accounts). I'm guessing almost all of them fit in with the not enough money crowd.

Right so in their 1% plan if every single coin was withdrawn they would make ~$3000.  That is their peak income.  Unless they are selling user data on the side.
Even if there were 70k accounts what is their MAU?  You're assuming everyone with a buck is going to be an active account.  I'm betting almost every single one of their accounts has been logged into less than half a dozen times and of that 67k in Feb I would be surprised if more than a quarter of those accounts have been active once since then.

The thing is though people estimated there were about 1 million users 2 years ago.  In the age of the internet where new things spread fast if you've seen no growth in years you're not on the verge of mass success you are on the cusp of failure.
Most people only hear the name and have no clue because despite everyone here being a fanatic it isn't that interesting of appealing to most people.  It doesn't offer any improvements over existing systems to the general public and where it emulates them it does it in a worse way.
In early 2014 people were talking about how it was just getting started and businesses were just taking off,  in late 2014 they were saying ignore the slope early 2015 is the time you'll see!  Now it's late 2015,  there has been no real progress into the general public and people are still saying 'it's just early give it more time'.
At what point will you personally say 'ok I was wrong this isn't going anywhere'?  Every time I ask this question I get either 'never' or a date like 10 years from now which shows the person has no confidence and just wants to pick a date far enough in the future to ensure they won't be called out on it.

The Silk Road system just involves a centralized escrow service.  That's not anything original and trusting DNMs has not worked out for a lot of people thanks to exit scams.
So I would say why would people other with the hassle of that when centralized companies already exist to do the same thing only more efficiently?
As I've said before Bitcoin is worse for users that existing tech in every category that matters.
@_date: 2015-10-10 12:57:51
I suspect it's just because he doesn't know what he's talking about and jumped for the first thing that came to mind.  In the case of Silk Road you have centralized and trusted third party to manage everything the same as eBay/PayPal.  Silk Road was still centrally managed reputation system and even there exit scams were the norm.  That works for people buying illegal shit but it doesn't float in legitimate markets.
How can you claim a decentralized system would likely work better?  What possible logic could you use to assume that?
Because how do you know which bad reviews are legit and which are scammers?  You don't and everyone will trend downwards as time goes since unhappy people leave more feedback than happy ones.  Without an incentive to leave positive feedback like centralized systems can offer you are left with only the negative.
what I'm saying is that once you decentralize it everything that works well for a centralized marketplace stops working.  With a centralized marketplace you have both already agreed on an escrow agent before even coming into communication.  That marketplace stands to profit way more from fair trade than unfair so generally markets of a decent size can be trusted more.
In OB you need to agree on an escrow agent when you're ready to buy.  How do you do that?  If one of you recommends one it is likely because you believe they will favour you.  You can't go off ratings for the reasons above.  And even once you do pick one what effort are they going to actually put into your dispute?  How will they solve it?  With central markets you can see trends from sellers but with decentralized systems the merchant can change escrow agents every time.
OB is stupid for a lot of reasons and it will be a huge flop.  No real plan for consumer security is just one of the many problems.

Thanks for the tagging.
I'm not imagining that no.  What I'm seeing is that when you make a payment over a channel you lock up x coins saying these are a part of a LN transaction now.  The problem is when the other side wants them out of LN.  There is no way to consolidate these small amounts so they can't.  Hence funds stuck in LN.  Nothing to do with addresses or channels(well I guess the closing of channels).  But entirely to do with the actual bitcoins.
I'll give you the example again.  You're a store that accepts LN transfers but ultimately you want Bitcoin.  A bunch of people send you 500 satoshi LN transactions.  How do you get Bitcoin you can use out of the LN now?  Only way I can see is hoping someone else will buy the coins off you via LN.  But then they are stuck with them since the coins they have are actually made up from lots of too small to transmit over the normal blockchain transactions.
Hopefully they answer.

I don't see any advantage to having these devices run inefficient miners when they could just access shared hot wallets.
Nor do I think the ideas like a vending machine that negotiates its own orders are likely.
People talk about using the blockchain to communicate between devices but that makes no sense you still have to built yet another protocol on top for the actual communication.  Might as well just send Json messages over http it would've just as effective.  Take the car battery example above.  That would require my transaction to outline where I was, what I look like and how much I would pay.  It would also require all nearby cars to keep a constantly updated copy of the blockchain to scan for messages that might be relevant to them.  Then it also needs them to recognize that your request is relevant and not just a fridge telling Amazon it needs more milk.  Hence the protocol on top.  You'd be better off just using a short distance wireless signal to broadcast a request to your immediate area.  No Bitcoin required,  you're not needlessly bloating the chain and you'll reach vehicles near you that can help you quickly.
All I'm reading here is people desperate to find a use case and trying to shoehorn ideas into Bitcoin even though they make no sense.

Alice can't send her 1 Bitcoin out of LN because doing so would require closing links which involve less than the required amount for a transaction.  So her coins are now locked in the network for good.

Who cares about reaching status as money.  You'll notice that Bitcoin has been publicly available for over half a decade now in a time where the Internet makes the spread of new things incredibly fast and outside of a small shrinking community no one cares.
There are PoS and RR style systems already.  He'll liquid is an RR style system that despite being a side gain doesn't require Bitcoin at all.


There is absolutely no reason for this to happen or make sense.  It is a dream told here by people who want to be rich.  It is the same sort of stuff you hear from people that see banks working on other blockchains and go 'it doesn't matter one true blockchain' while the banks continue to work away at alternatives.
There is no need for a single ledger.  There is no benefit to a single ledger unless you happened to be one of the first people to acquire it's tokens and you want to be rich.

How does each script know when it is its turn in the round robin?  What happens if a script runs out of order due to clock shift or something?
Ordering or transactions in the final table does matter though and you need to be sure that all the systems get that ordering right.  So how would you do that?  You've just hand waved and said 'a script would do it' that isn't an answer though that is avoiding an answer.
This script keeps getting more and more tasks.  It sounds like you no longer have a master master db solving the problem but instead this script is that just happens to have a db backend.
Why is that surely you should be able to do it using just s master master db setup like you've repeatedly suggested.
Really?  You know how it works and your only solution involved building a system around the database.  Why do you think a dba would do any better?
And why do you think reimplementing all of the functionality of a private blockchain in a script with a db backend is different than just using a dedicated private blockchain?  I mean your solution for replicating a private blockchain with a db is literally to build s private blockchain.

Buddies no but there are plenty of working groups and private communications networks banks already work together on.  You don't have to trust each other.  All the actions are public amongst the group.  I'm guessing you don't know much about banking if you believe it works with no cooperation.
The diagram depends on the banks involved and the number of parties is required due to complex settlement issues which private blockchains could solve by easily allowing banks to swap debt on the fly to minimize external commitments.  This makes things not only faster but cheaper for them since they presumably have to move less actual money around.
Example:  my customer wants to send your customer $10.  I give you a token representing that and you give cash to your customer straight away.  Now you realize that I hold a $10 token from bank c who in turn holds a $10 token from me.  I trade my token with c and were even.  C trades with you and now you're even.  $10 sent and no actual settlement required.  Obviously it won't always be that clean but it opens you up to at least trading for tokens of banks it is easier for you to settle with.  All of this can be done automatically. 
Could it be done without a private blockchain?  Definitely.  But that doesn't mean it won't work with one.
@_date: 2015-11-26 01:09:16
The private blockchain isn't there to establish trust it's to facilitate communication without needing to hand control over to any one member of the group.  Beyond that the feature set you get with a private blockchain would be a nightmare to implement in a traditional RDBMS.  
Tell me how you would implement a system with the following features in your traditional DB implementation.
-Shared ownership(no single master)  
-Immutable transaction  
-known transaction ordering across participants
Just those three things how would you do that?
@_date: 2015-10-28 18:48:30
Building initially probably not but you only have to do it once.  Deploying definitely.
Even in building it shouldn't be too difficult since blockchains aren't complex tech the only thing to figure out is a decent RR block generation system which I think blocks treat has already solved.

 &gt;But, the point is there's no reason to transfer them out of the LN address, since they are practically unusable outside LN (since LN has fees less than 1 satoshi, while Bitcoin on-chain has fees ~10,000 satoshis). Right? A quantity like 500 satoshis can only be used realistically on LN, so the incentive is for the store to just leave them there on the LN address.
Here is where the confusion is coming from.  A single transfer of 500 no there is no need to transfer them out but what if you have hundreds of people all sending you 500?  The origins of those 500 are the half transactions that lock them for LN.  Hundreds of them.  Even if your LN wallet says you have one full Bitcoin it is still made up of many thousands of these small amounts.  So you can have a full Bitcoin in LN with no way to use the funds outside LN since consolidating all those initial amounts into your one coin would cost more than it's worth.  That will always be true for these small amounts of any size below the dust threshold do anyone receiving a payment in LN that at any point originated in one of these micro transactions cannot access those funds outside of LN.


This is what I'm saying though.  Even if the total in your address is greater than that amount the parts of it(in this case 21 small transactions) will likely be small meaning you can't access those parts because to consolidate you have to build different transactions for each.

Bitcoin has had 6


Yes picking a random point in the life of a tech that found success is something bitcoiners regularly do.  It's unfortunate they have to keep changing the tech as Bitcoin keeps failing to live up to expectations


The problem for you though is that all of those are done better by other p2p(ish) systems like venmo.

Your comparison is so one sided it is embarrassing.
**The average eCommerce store:**


How do the open source web stores include fees?  What restrictions do they have that OB doesn't? What privacy concerns?  Why would they be more susceptible to customer identities being exposed?  Or transactions or revenue?  They wouldn't.  Literally every point here doesn't apply to those so it's dishonest to include them and I'm guessing you know this.


Or straight though bitcoin if you want.  So the only difference here is that you have access to customers that don't use bitcoin.  Which is almost all of them.  Again just throwing 'privacy concerns, customer identity exposed, transactions exposed, revenues exposed' into every point to make them look longer doesn't make them any more correct.


Not true.  There is nothing stopping you from using just bitcoin.  No one does it because no one that tries makes money.


Or setup an RSS feed.  Oh look it's your standard space fillers again.


 there are a lot of free and easy to setup solutions.  Pretty sure all the major OS ecommerce platforms have free plugins for this too.


You already posted this.


This isn't true.  Lots of people under 18 run online stores and again there is nothing stopping you from using just bitcoin except a desire to have customers.


See above.  Not that the unbanked is a great target market for an online store.


Bullshit.  Just about every VPS or shared hosting account in the past 15 years has come with a one click way to install an ecommerce platform.  These are mature products.  If you want to fully customize it then it can be complex but that isn't needed for almost all use cases.


Again bullshit.  I can install a store on a $5/month droplet no problem.  I could actually probably install a dozen of them on it.


Everyone with a web browser


Or SEO
VS 
**The standard OpenBazaar store:**


You would hope so since it is ecommerce software.  But OS ecommerce platforms have this too.  


See above about bitcoin only being possible just stupid.


So bitcoin only and restricted userbase? got it.


See above.  Also the belief that anyone on this platform will have enough customers to go over mailchimps free threshold is a joke.


See above.  This isn't unique.


No customers


Same as above


Targeting people who can't or won't get a bank account online.  Sounds like a sound business proposition.  You realize these people can't easily get coins either right?  Because they are unbanked they are stuck with ATMs/LBC all charging them a premium for coins.  They might as well just shop local.






Unless you don't want to run it from your home connection.


ssl exists for websites too making all of these the same for someone hosting a web shop.


Anyone in the world with bitcoin(so ~1m people) who are willing to spend it(so probably ~100k actually) who are willing to install OB to shop(probably &lt;20k).  But ya anyone!


So lets say it becomes popular and a bunch of merchants sign up.  How do you ensure your products are seen in the search?


How is the foundation better?  It starts out with a feature set that excludes almost every single person that shops online.

No they aren't.  When you have a private blockchain you don't need to worry about slow links or people with crap bandwidth so you can increase block size and decrease time between blocks by a lot.  You don't need to support every use case either so you can optimize transaction size.

Yes, no one issues the keys the user would generate it and submit it for approval and the other members would submit a vote.  How do you protect against bad actors?  By not voting to approve their key and by having a process to reject keys.

Revoking keys is to stop pointless blocks not to stop writing anything to the ledger.  There is nothing a bad actor could write to the ledger that wasn't signed by another participant except transactions from their own account in which case who cares.

Bitcoin is totally incapable of doing that though due to how inefficient it is.

What have you learned that you couldn't from reading?  What use will that knowledge be to you going forward?
You can move btc around without mining so that's a lame excuse.

Your position is now clear.  You only support free speech in causes you agree with.  Which is to say you don't support free speech at all.

Why do you think they aren't then?  It's not like Bitcoin is a secret or difficult to get in America anymore.  perhaps because they don't want it?  Some sure I'll give you that I wasn't trying to be absolute in my statement though I really should be careful in the future since it seems a lot of people here get really confused by generalization.

ok look at what you said there.  The small amounts would be consolidated in LN but outside LN they exist as half signed transactions that are too small to complete.  To move them out of LN you need to sign those transactions and complete them but you can't because they cost more that they are worth.
I think we're at a stalemate though if not understanding eachother and we've not made progress in about 10 messages so I think we'd best give up.  Thanks for trying though.

This is what I was talking about when I mentioned your embarrassing stalking.
Who cares how many accounts I have.  They are claiming 2.7 million.  Do you thing any number I've created could matter?

Do you think they have?  Or do you think they would count each of my possible accounts as a separate one?

The public internet matters to you because that is all you need and have access too.


Really?  You can't think of any that advance society?  What about research networks?
Your mistake seems to be in thinking these people want to include you or that they want to replace Bitcoin.  The reality is they've realized Bitcoin doesn't work for their needs and they've moved past it.  While everyone here is shouting that they're making a mistake.
You sound like someone that is scared they are about to be bypassed.

Looks like Reddit agreed with me since the post has been deleted and Paxful banned yet again.

Useful how?  Interesting in what way?
It is Paxful saying 'we are still here oh and we totes have lots of customers honest'
And spamming?  Really?  When you throw out random words like that which don't make sense in context you just look silly 
@_date: 2015-10-15 11:37:34
Here is how you test it.  Generate a hash with 5 0s at the start followed by a 1 when given the input string 'this is a test' plus a random string of your choosing.  That hash has to be the same as when you run sha256(sha256(that string))
Nothing else matters if you can't do that you haven't succeeded.  Will save you time waste figuring out interfaces.

You build into the system which keys can sign and a way to approve/reject keys.  Or more likely you have a shared group which just adds and removes keys from the source without the requirement for complex voting algorithms.

1 they don't tax the asset they tax the profit that you make when you sell it so saying you lost them all only makes sense if you don't plan on using them ever again with a known merchant/exchange since they'll just ask them for the customers details and when it's you then you're fucked.  Even in that case when you don't plan on spending them with such a merchant they will likely ask for evidence that they were stolen which you won't have since you weren't planning this far ahead.  And if you were you would be making false police reports and again the coins would be unusable with mainstream merchants/exchanges.

Continuing on with something after its already peaked and everyone else has moved on.  That comment is more perfect than I think you intended.

So the users then since end users aren't going to have direct access they will be working through internal systems to write.

I'm not sure if you're aware of this or not but cabs can already accept credit cards.  Bitcoin would add nothing and AA is a joke you should probably not listen to him.

Why do you think these companies are unable to change the currency they deal with?  Like you they aren't holding large amounts of USD.
As I said before you don't know what you're talking about.

Yes Yelp works by hiding a great deal of reviews that it considers untrustworthy or questionable.  It's pretty much s requirement of s good rating system.
Tell me a situation that would incentivize you to bothering to leave positive feedback for an escrow agent?  'Sided with me'.  Now think of the situations that would lead to negative 'didn't side with me','was too slow/demanding/etc'.  It's not that no one gives reviews it's that for the service in question there is way more negative experiences possible for the users even when it is working.  I've explained that repeatedly yet you still throw out the same stupid 'other reviews exist' argument.  Talk about lazy.
I do know, and they really haven't.  Their system is s joke and it will be a huge flop just like every other system that comes out built on Bitcoin.

Possibly only if it is also trans dimensional.  Success in our future isn't certain.

because the bank will need to acquire enough Bitcoin for that upfront then trade it then the receiver would have to sell it.  Banks are trading more than just cash so holding large sums of Bitcoin for that type of trade wouldn't make sense even if all cash was replaced with Bitcoin.  With the private chain you can trade arbitrary value which could represent anything without having to tie up the capital into a third asset class.

Yes it's my first time visiting the users seem weird not sure I'll be back.
@_date: 2015-10-13 13:52:58
But obviously if they are trading usd then they settle off chain so we're still at square one of why this needs to be attached to Bitcoin in anyway other that politics.
@_date: 2015-10-13 13:41:40
That explains what it's use is but again not why it needs to be tied to Bitcoin in anyway it seems it would have 100% functionality without it.

What exactly did you think they were trying to disrupt with private blockchains?  Of course they are trying to disrupt their own processes.

Yes people here say that a lot.  Which database would you recommend that does multi master-master replication with Unmodifiable change control?
Call it what you want it is what most companies what and being snarky about the naming isn't going to change the fact that it will be what issued in place of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-10-29 17:20:09
1. Banks aren't trying to create public chains st the moment.
2. If they did decide to do one and they decided to use PoW.  All they would have to do is change the algorithm from double sha256 and all Bitcoin miners would be useless at mining on it.
@_date: 2015-10-28 20:07:27
If you think it's an agenda you are severely overestimating how much anyone outside this sub cares about Bitcoin.
