I can't help but think that MtGox was a victim of its own success. Perhaps if they grew much slower they would be able to create more controls to ensure that customer funds were more accounted for. Perhaps they would have spent more time improving their internal security measures. Perhaps they wouldn't have felt the need to run internal bots or funny things like that....
Just a thought.

Here at [Magnr.com]( we are going to continue our dialogue with the regulators to ensure as and when regulation comes in to place, it genuinely makes sense.
We would like the Uk to become a safe haven for morally run, transparent and trusted Bitcoin startups to call home. The politicians in London always welcome FinTech innovation based out of the city, and it seems that they are friendly and open to talking to Bitcoin companies too. Things are looking up for the Uk crypto scene.
By doing this, we will allow established players in the corporate banking world to start pouring investment into Bitcon's infrastructure.

This show's her confidence in what she is doing.
The CEO of Barclays Capital (the position she was offered) is often paid WAY more then the CEO of Barclays Group (the over-arching entity). This is because Barclays Capital has for many years been the main source of revenue generated by the entire bank. Get that job and you can expect a pay check in the tens of millions per year.

BBC has great influence on the British public. What I've hated up till this point is that their technology correspondent (pictured on the screen) has always been an outspoken pessimist of Bitcoin and used to love calling it a big fad publicly on radio shows and other journalism pieces.
He needs to get with times. Check out the BBC news technology section, the closest thing to news they have on their website regarding Bitcoin was a piece last week on the Winklevoss brothers:
No mention of this new announcement. (which in my opinion has a much bigger implication) Is it me or does anyone else think that the BBC represents bitcoin in an unfair light?

We are the [Magnr]( team from London and spent a lot of 2015 talking to the investment banks here.
I wouldn't say its hate, however what became very obvious is that 'Bitcoin bad Blockchain good' became a very successful PR campaign for both for certain 'blockchain solutions' companies to sell contracts to financial institutions. 2016 has seen this activity stop which is why we think sentiment, certainly in the western world - US/UK is on the rise.
I encourage you all to read each story in the press very carefully, especially if its negative about Bitcoin and see what companies are mentioned in the same story. If it mentions Blockchain technologies as a revolutionary solution and also mentions one of these companies, its almost certainly 'spin' created by writers. I call on the reddit communities to call this out. A lot of you are fairly savvy to it already. Spread the word.

Good suggestion. I like the slider type of interface as it is both intuitive and informative. The only other thing I would change from your suggestion is having the fee display in USD (or a local currency) as well.
I know for myself I would slide it up, but then would immediately find a calculator to go do 0.0005 * 423.59 (current price I'm seeing on my price monitoring program). I would then say to myself, aah, 21 cents, thats reasonable - or not, depending on how much I'm trying to send.
@_date: 2016-01-25 14:25:40
Although I admire Coinbase as a company, this won't be a good move for Bitcoin. It needs to be independent. Otherwise Coinbase would monopolise the entire industry. We need independent startups who can help with development, but no one company should control Bitcoin development. In finance, a move like this would create excessive counterparty risk on one entity.
To back this up with some actual hard data, when MtGox had the monopoly on the exchange market (admittedly it didn't ask for it), look what happened to the price when they suffered a hack. Huge losses. We are only just beginning to recover from that.
Having multiple risk counterpartys is a good thing. Having 1 is a very bad thing.
@_date: 2016-03-29 19:50:15

^ Would you say that sentence is a perfect TLDR for the paper.
From what I read, it seemed to indicate that there simply is no strong correlation between bitcoin's price and any other existing equity / currency / basket.

I think instead of running it decentralised (everyone in business management knows this is very tough to do), centralise the management and running of the organisation.
This is not to say that everybody who wants to be part of it should be located in a single geography, but operationally it should be located and run out of a single centre.
The Basel accords which all major banks and investment banks across the world follow is run by the Bank for International Settlements in Basel, Switzerland. It is a forum where policy and standards are discussed and agreed upon by its members. The committee are made up of member states but in Bitcoin's case could easily be donators. And the key point, its run (or at least administered) in Basel.
Paul Graham (of Y Combinator) recommends that for any new organisation regardless of if their mission, profit or non-profit, one thing you should NEVER do, is innovate on all things management.
Bringing it back to basics, why not have it keep to no more then three core purposes, and pay to have it administered from a single location, e.g. London. That way you remove complexities and the cost associated of running multiple operations across multiple locations. Added benefits besides the obvious cost-savings? Spending is easier to account for and to make operations both transparent and audit-able.

I had a lot of experience with BTCJam in its early days and I found a high default rate. I'm sure they have worked hard to lower it but the risk of default will always exist. End customers have the ability to withdraw their funds and disappear which is a risk that is difficult to control.
I set up [Magnr Savings]( as a closed-loop ecosystem where savers who want to earn interest of their Bitcoins can do so in a safer, more risk-controlled environment. Interest revenue is generated from Magnr Trading (formerly BTC.sx). Because borrowers are not able to withdraw funds, we can ensure defaults from clients disappearing is not a problem. The interest rate offered reflects the lower risk however please bear in mind that ANY service which pays interest, even in the fiat banking world, only does so because there is risk (look up what happened in Greece and Cyprus with depositor funds).
Yes, that was a plug for Magnr, but here's some free advice, if you do not want *ANY risk of loss*, my best recommendation is to keep your bitcoins safe on your own hardware, offline backup or brain wallet etc. That way you can be entirely responsible for the risks you take with your own bitcoins.
Contrary to popular belief, the business of banking and finance is about risk, not about money. Money is just the means in which risk is transferred.

From a technologist's standpoint, Bitcoin is not fungible.
and this is a big however, the FBI sale of Bitcoins essentially proves on a legal basis the fungibility of Bitcoins as a transaction unit. Let me explain my reasoning. 
* The FBI coins generally go for either around market rate, or if anything slightly higher. 
* The source of these coins were Silk Road.
If from a legal standpoint they are not fungible, then the market value would be lower. In this case, the FBI has essentially laundered and layered coins back into circulation.

Web developer here who's worked with a handful of 2FA solutions.
Authy provides a more friendly 2FA experience. Its popularity has been driven by a user desire for a more convenient UX and a managed 2FA solution rather then actual security.
At [Magnr]( we use the open source Google Authenticator. There are pro's and cons of each, the major one being that keys are recoverable on authy as your account is linked to your mobile phone number which leads to less support issues for the integrating company for customers who switch phones.
Your observation is correct though.
Authy is more secure then no 2FA
Open source 2FA is more secure then Authy
This reminds me of the paradox of password managers. Ultimately its a hacker's trove if its cracked, however to many, its a better alternative to re-using the same password on a bunch of websites.

I have my own suspicions that one of the reasons why Coinbase used Authy is that they are both VC backed by Y Combinator:

They both use the same core protocol. Authy essentially acts as a 2FA key manager though and backs up your keys for you.

Is AirBnB backed by any of the Paypal mafia? Could be a secret handshake type of deal going on there behind closed doors.
... or i could just be talking crap
