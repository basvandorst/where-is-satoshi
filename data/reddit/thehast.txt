There are plenty $20 billion+ hedge funds...

It gets harder and harder to get a high return the more money you have.
If I think a company is going to do well, I can just open up my online brokerage account and place a buy order for $10000 worth of a commonly traded stock (high liquidity) fairly easily.  While $10000 is a lot of money for an average Joe retail investor, it is nothing to a hedge fund or any other institution.
If a hedge fund manager thinks a company will be more valuable in the future, they might try and buy $50 million worth.  Even with a very liquid stock buying $50 million worth of shares isn't so simple.  
On top of all that, a buy order of $50 million will move the price of the stock all on its own!  It's publicly traded, everyone else can see the trades you are making.  Supply and demand very much applies, and once you put in that buy order, there is suddenly too little supply for too much demand and the price is driven up, all from one trade!  So you thought the price of a stock could raise 15%, but it's already risen 10% on the news that you want to buy a bunch, cutting into any returns you were seeking.  As a result of this, hedge funds and other big institutional investors pretty much have to buy any large position in chucks over time.  It works the other way around too, try dumping $50 million of stock at once and watch the price plummet.
So if one of my $10000 positions spikes 10%, I can just immediately sell for my 10% gain, the same is not true for a large investor.
There are other reasons too, like having to deal with your investors wanting to get their cash out and having to sell out of positions earlier than you wanted to.  Not to mention, if you are famous for making good trades, there will be crowds of people watching your every move trying to get in on what you're doing.

It's a lot easier to beat the market when you aren't a hedge fund manager, though.

So does the pool have no order and the miners just prioritize transactions with higher Sat/B?
I sent a transaction yesterday at 231 Sat/B and it is sitting with 0 confirmations.  Are other people just paying higher fees and cutting in line ahead of me?  Am I going to have to wait for the network to free up and fees to lower before my transaction goes through?
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:50:29
Yeah I saw you could raise the fees, I read the instructions and it didn't look like I could do it. I'm using electrum 3.something

Everybody stop, does the Dilbert cartoonist really use Gmail? You't think they'd at least have their own domain name.

I mined one whole bitcoin, but it took a week and I decided it wasn't worth it...

Even cancelled debt is taxed. Win a new car? Better get out your wallet, the IRS is coming.
@_date: 2017-11-15 02:25:55
How are they going to prove tax basis though?
@_date: 2017-10-13 15:12:53
I completely agree. Too many people are piling on expecting to double their money like the last fork. The market is going to move whichever direction causes the most pain.

420 trade it

You know the Japanese Navy still uses it, right? The National flag of Japan during wwii is almost exactly the same as the current flag but no one has problems with that? 
It's a cool looking flag, get over it. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 14:23:40
Better let the Finnish air force know some of their flags break the rules. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 16:34:07
I'd rather walk down the street with the rising sun flag than with one of those Finnish air force flags, and I think that is telling. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 16:11:47
The flag didn't do shit! That's the whole point I'm making! That colored rectangle holds no responsibility for anyone's deaths. 
I in no way think what Finland did during wwii was nearly as horrible as what the Japanese were up to, but the Finnish weren't exactly saints. It's war, there is no right or wrong. Everything is a shade of gray. To just say Japan bad Finland good is an incredibly sophomoric way to look at history. To extend this view to taking offense to the colored rectangles used by "bad" is just a lazy way to be politically correct. 
I don't think people that fly the rising sun flag are doing it to align themselves with unit 731, do you? I think they are flying it because it's a cool flag. Just because you relate this particular cloth rectangle to war crimes doesn't mean anyone else has to. 
And I correct myself Finland was never technically axis, they were just allied with Germany. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:55:20
By your logic a Japanese Navy (axis power) flag from wwii is bad, but a Finnish air force (flying bf109s) flag from wwii is just fine? 
Both flags are currently flown over a peacetime military. 
I don't know what being a democracy has to do with anything. Finland was a democracy when they allied with Hitler (because Russia), does that somehow make it better? 
Not to mention by your definition they are both failed nations, *they were on the same side.*
@_date: 2016-10-13 15:30:46
Finland air force used the swastika long before Hitler did.

Quick! Someone post that "you are here" anatomy of a market bubble chart!
@_date: 2016-10-13 04:21:27
But flying the flag of the nation of Japan is ok? Can I not fly the Turkish flag because it flew over a genocide? 
Why do you find a colored rectangle so offensive.

It's as anonymous and safe as you make it.
