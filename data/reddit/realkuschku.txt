In Google Chrome nowadays it does – Google also counts it's users web histories for PageRank.

It's not possible. Sorry for your loss.

But that's what this problem is about: Market domination. A simple ad on each site more wouldn't change anything, but if a company holds other corporations ransom in such a manner that shouldn't be legal.

Still AdBlockPlus is trying to create a monopoly. If everyone uses EasyList then Til Faida has a monopoly on ads. If you want to have ads on your site, you'll have to pay Til Faida because only he can add your site to the list of unobtrusive ads.
This is active monopoly creation. We (are here because we don't like monopolies on banking, right? Why should we support monopolies in the ad market then?

Sorry, those pre-paid credit cards are called credit cards, but technically are more like debit cards.

At least it supports dogecoin.
I'd say only dogecoin (because of the community and the projects they did) and bitcoin (because of existing infrastructure) will ever have a chance to become huge, so one of my personal  coins is in there.

1. AdBlockPlus controls the blocklists for almost 70% of the users of the web, this means they can enforce fees ("Pay us or we'll add you to EasyList") on advertisement networks. And AdBlockPlus is owned by an Advertisement company itself, so technically they are trying to create a disadvantage for competitors.
1. A cartel or oligopoly is technically the same as a monopoly.

German here, PayPal only with PostIdent and BankIdent (so you need to go to the mail company, let them identify you, then get a letter, send that to paypal, then wait for money transferred to your account (4 days) enter the amount on the website and then transfer it back (again 4 days) until your account is activated).  
And if you transfer more than 2000$ in a month your account is blocked and being manually observed to stop money laundering...
Bank transfer: 4 days or you use SofortÜberweisung, which has huge fees (up to 20%) and sells all your data, so you'll get spam per mail (real life mail) just the day after.
And pre-paid credit: Almost nowhere to get, and where you can get it it's extremely expensive, which results in fees of about 20 to 50%. Not viable either.

I thought Europe was the first world, America (both of them) the "new world" (2nd world) and the rest being the 3rd world?

I own only 10 Dogecoin, actually. I just think that their community is more nice to hang around.
But those publicity stunts – for example sponsoring a car race alongside with corporations like GoDaddy – creates a huge additional trust in the minds of many technological unexperienced people.

Hah, funny – for example in my country it's quite complex to get a good credit card. There is only a single bank which provides free pre-paid credit-cards to pupils without having ridiculous high fees.

And several of the ads which are on the "acceptable Ads"-list don't fulfil the requirements for acceptable ads. In fact, some of them even got rejected before the company paid money and afterwards they got accepted.
Also the development team of AdBlockPlus is paid by a company which itself works in the Ad industry and sells pop-up, pop-under and full-size banner ads. Those are also NOT blocked by ABP.

But the map you linked doesn't make sense either, sweden can't ever be considered third world, no matter how you'd interpret
the definition.

I know, but it was probably the hardest decision they ever had to make – include this DRM or lose almost all customers over the next few years.

I can actually provide sources:

AdBlockPlus' company is partially owned United Internet AG which also owns AffiliNet and BinLayer.
And about the Google payments: Actually it was only 25mio $, sorry that I remembered it wrong.

Exactly. The only solution is to get extremely overpriced pre-paid credit cards or get a credit card from a bank, but they are also ridiculous overpriced. So if you want to pay online here you'd probably use bank transfer, paypal, or pay via mail (which means when the mail guy hands you the package, you can directly at him with your card).
Which still doesn't solve the problem that most US websites only allow credit cards. I'm searching for 3 years now for a cheap solution to get a Google Play Developer account...
@_date: 2014-06-06 21:26:48
You use a different word for debit card than – you probably mean Visa Plus or Maestro (Cirrus) which are both called debit cards, but don't provide only paying.
probably talks about "proper" debit cards which are just like credit cards.
To be fair, though, I only know a single person who had credit card, and he canceled the contract again because it was too expensive. In my country no one uses credit cards either.
@_date: 2014-06-07 00:18:08
So you're saying todays colloquial definition of "3rd world" is wrong?
@_date: 2014-05-11 16:36:19
Oh, okay, I just thought you'd want to hide that because you already blurred all other personal information.

They had no other choice – all other browsers already include this DRM system and the W3C plans to integrate this DRM system into the official HTML standard.

To explain it more in detail, there are 2 kinds of debit cards here (Germany):
1. Maestro  [front]( [back](  
They have a card number, but are bound to the account. They are usable for paying at EC-Terminals (you enter the card, enter your PIN, wait 10 seconds, get your card out, purchase made) and at ATMs, but not online.  


2.  Visa Plus base ATM-cards  
Those ATM cards have no card number at all, they just do regular bank transfers.
@_date: 2014-06-02 06:23:00
They do after Google paid 30 Million €.
EDIT: It actually were only 25mio US-$.

But dogecoin has also something to offer: Good publicity. They have an amazing community that always produces good PR for cryptocurrencies.
