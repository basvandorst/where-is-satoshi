@_date: 2019-09-20 08:18:36
Agreed, I am depressed. Maybe this time, I will drop out from college.. I can't get my money back. Maybe I will work part-timer for the rest of my life...
@_date: 2019-09-20 09:36:08
Yes thank you. Today is the last payment of my tuition fee. I will try to contact my friends and try to see the head teacher.. if hope is lost.. I just work part time haha
@_date: 2019-09-20 10:41:44
Then I get taxes from my country.....
@_date: 2019-09-20 10:51:22
Thank you.. I was working and still working now, I began working part time. When you are 15 years old you can't live in the orphanage anymore.. so I started working part time in mcd lols... And study in school for free from goverment(so much kindness) until finish high school... I got scholarship 50% tuition fee offs from to go to college.. and still working part time.... But.. because today I don't have money anymore.. well there were but for living expenses, not quite good for tuition fee.. so I decided to quit, save money, and looking for more 2 part time job.. if my calculation is correct, in 27 years old, I can clear all my debts and buy house..... 
This experience will open my eyes from now on.. I will be more cautious and think carefully from now on..
