Thanks for your compassion and honesty and I guess I didn’t know the first rule about cryptocurrency.  I still feel like these are design issues that have solutions, probably because I’m annoyed I made that mistake.
But I imagine that most of the people in the world won’t know that rule and will be equally disappointed by cryptocurrency until it is more foolproof.  If Bitcoin is going to have any real-world usage, it needs a lot of work.  Someone posted that “Bitcoin today in its current statewould be considered a shitcoin” (paraphrasing) and I couldn’t agree more.

Wtf man? Is this normal??
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:00:42
How do I check?

Sorry for the n00b question; I’ve had transaction 4b7f7e5f9b605f2a79da9aa227d35b3689fcde9a0c030c6b53527c2cb55343cb processing since the 22nd with 475 confirmations between Mycelium and CoinBase but it’s not showing up in CoinBase yet.  Is this normal?  It was a low priority transaction, does that make the difference?
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:32:32
Ok so I just found out that my Coinbase account never had the address that I used for Mycelium, so I guess it’s just gone?  Will it be refunded?
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:07:38
Ok I can see that the address I sent the funds too does have those funds.  However; in CoinBase, my address is constantly changing, what’s that all about?  Every minute or so, it changes to a different hash and none of them have funds...

The guy would only take cash
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:13:41
Ok I did, hopefully it doesn’t take them so long to figure it out.

You are correct.  And if I only ever use my Bitcoin as Bitcoin, then there is no problem.  But I couldn’t make the purchases with that money that I wanted, I had to move it to USD.  It’s the whole ecosystem of high fees and inefficent/unsafe transferring of Bitcoin that is the source of my problems.

I see, seems a bit amateur of them not to be able to handle a simple transaction...
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:39:08
Maybe an old Coinbase account I had that wasn’t verified because I had created it in Serbia.  I really hope I recreated my account before I did the transaction; I just can’t remember if I did :(
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:11:59
Yea that’s exactly what I did.  However, I did just realize my account wasn’t verified so I just fixed that, maybe that will help...
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:13:26
Can I check that different address against my Coinbase account in any way?
