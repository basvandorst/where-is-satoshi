I have a bank account with ANZ, and use one of the exchanges listed in the article and my account is fine. Just to be safe I'm on the phone to my bank now but it looks to me like its only been people doing dodgey things like not paying tax and money laundering that have been banned so far.

I'm not insulted, It's not directed at me. I just noticed there's a lot of people in here who like to gloat at others misfortune and act like they're super intelligent because they can "hodl". 
Which is funny in itself because the term originated from a guy who was a self confessed terrible trader so his strategy was to "hodl".

Insulting and gloating over those who already probably feel terrible at their decision.
I believe the only pathetic one here is you.

Not broke, I sold out before the crash and brought back in on the dip. I cleaned up by not hodling. The only difference is when I see someone else made a poor decision. I try to help them rather then kick em while they are down and gloat about how superior I am.

The only 3 times I've sold my bitcoin in the past 2 months, and its crashed all 3 times. Maybe I'm lucky, but I don't jump on reddit and make memes about how "pathetic" hodlers are for not cashing out and buying the dip.

I sold at 17,000 and brought back in at 13. Why would I be salty? Everyone makes mistakes, but only assholes kick people when they are down.

I never said it was, "hodling" is not an indicator you're successful too. Nor do I care if you're successful or not. Not everyone has what it takes to be a trader. But those that do don't need to gloat and rub others face in it.

Again, I sold at 17 and brought back at 13, I made a killing from not hodling.

Us regular humans often mess things up because we didn't research properly or misunderstood things, infact one could argue its almost one of our define characteristics. 
Someone like you who's never made a mistake in your life wouldn't understand the plight of normal mortals. I just hope that you can show humility with your god like wisdom and not rub peoples nose in it.

Gloating is making a thread calling everyone else pathetic. Not responding to a false statement that I lost all my money and I'm salty.
It's the difference between looking for an opportunity to make others feel bad, and correcting false information. I suggest you google the word if you are unfamiliar.
