I think bitcoin maximalists are going to get a rude awakening once btc falls below 50% of market share.

And those odds don't map on to anything real.

Yes they don’t get it. Other coins are using zk-snarks because they are impervious to hacking with quantum computers.

I just bought some btc for the first time. One of my friends is a blockchain programmer, so I had him buy it and he sent it to my wallet. I was excited about the various applications of blockchain, and then got interested in the coin itself. 
He sent the coin, and it took over an hour to end up in my wallet. At that point I didn’t see how it could ever catch on. He then told me about ways transactions could speed up and put me at some ease. 
Bottom line - as a new person, slow transaction times alone are sufficient to kill interest. And the entire future of btc is hanging on the interest of the new person.

It’s interesting that developers seem to naturally revert back to trust-based relationships when trying to prevent fraud, when that’s what made fraud possible in the first place.
