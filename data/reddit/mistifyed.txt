For starters, it's not a legal tender, so that's a minus, nonetheless for cryptocurrencies to be considered money it needs to go beyond simply transferring cryptocurrencies to another wallet. Cryptocurrency real value will come when it's used to store real assets that will carry value. The ability to have a piece of data that is unique and cannot be copied or altered by someone rather than the private key holder makes it the only way to digitalize tangible assets.
When you think about it, all cryptocurrencies shouldn't have value, all of these prices are purely made up by manipulation and sentiment which in terms does not define the real value of it.
