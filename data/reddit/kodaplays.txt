First of all - I'm not happy about the fees and I agree that the network congestion (hitting the tx limits of the system) doesn't do any good for the adoption of bitcoin. However, I don't see what bitcoin being a currency - in the sense of a commonly accepted medium of exchange - has to do with bitcoin being a store of value. 
It can be any one of those things or both of those, once the scaling is figured out (and solutions are coming/being worked on).  Think of it like this: gold bars - terrible currency, great store of value; sea shells - great currency, terrible store of value; yet both of these were/are used in their singular function. Bitcoin might become both - I'm fairly certain it will.

I suggest reading this 
Adding to what is written in that article: not only the payment system (which includes noone being able to double spend their bitcoin and noone being able to counterfeit bitcoin) , but the neutrality (meaning any payment is treated the same, there's no "allowed" or "banned" transactions") and persistent resistance to censorship of this neutrality is what represents the *intrinsic value" of bitcoin.
Another thing.. Bitcoin being a neutral payment system doesn't mean it needs to be a free payment system in order to have value. How high this value is a matter of convention among us, the participants.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:44:23


The benefit of the decentralized making process is in the resistance to state interference. No country/coalition of countries can enforce a law or other regulation on bitcoin itself. When there's a centralized known entity (an individual or a company), "running" the cryptocoin, governments can force that entity (either by transaparent or covert means) to implement changes to the protocol that will make it compliant with government demands. 
You might say: *So what? I'll just sell if this happens and I don't like it.*  
Well, so will many others, which will cause a "run on the banks" type of situtation and make the value of that coin plummet. Not really a good outlook for something that we'd like to see as (also) a store of value, is it?

This is going on basically all over Europe. Even the last bastion of trading in cash (Germany) is about [to fall](   
Mind you, these limits in thousands of € are only in consumer-&gt;business transactions, B2B transactions are much LOWER (like 400€ or something). This means that a small business owner can't even buy a laptop in cash in most of the EU anymore. As I said, Germany (and Austria) is one of the last bastions of resistance, but they'll probably fall soon as well.

Hardforking per se isn't a sign of centralization. BCH hardfork in concreto is.

Of course they're comfortable with hard-forks, because Bcash is run by good buddies who work in unison. This is actually beneficial for the implementation of changes to the coin (no danger of disagreeement between different factions), but terrible for the neutrality and censorship-resistance of the coin, because it means it's centralized.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:11:58
It's actually the other way around. Bitcoin developers work on improving bitcoin and don't have time for PR stunts and attacks on social media. BCash has Bitcoin.com and its 60+ employes (how many of them are actual coders/programmers, not just social media snake oil salesmen???) that can work on spreading their agenda all over the place.

Not sure if you're stupid, trolling or malevolent all together, but FREE MARKET does not mean game on without any rules / boundaries whatsoever. Ever heard of the old roman *"Honeste vivere, alterum non laedere, suum cuique tribuere"*? 
Fraudulent market manipulation and pump and dump schemes  (even if it's a free market) will come under scrutiny of government officials, you can bet your ass on it. 
And for all you dipshits laughing about how "babies are crying for government help, but they wanted non-regulation in bitcoin". We don't want regulations interfering with the bitcoin network (the tech, the protocol) as a neutral and non-exclusive money system is the core of bitcoin. Of course on/off-ramps (exchanges) will have to be regulated and rightly so. Exchanges are not part of the bitcoin network ffs. If an exchange gets hacked and its bitcoin get stolen from the hot wallet, was bitcoin hacked? Of course not. Watch Andreas' hearing in front of the canadian senate, where he specifically addresses this topic.  
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:02:45
You're making some interesting points. I agree that holding BTC with the hope of it appreciating in value because of its fixed supply is a sort of *rent-seeking*, however I don't see it as a detrimental form of rent-seeking as is the example with the troll. As you wrote, he's **withholding access to a valuable resource** by setting up the chain - the river itself; and by doing this everyone else is worse off.  
What valuable resource am I withholding from everyone else by buying bitcoin and bitcoin going up in price afterwards? The bitcoin itself by not using it? Those who want to use it strictly as a currency, or rather as a medium of exchange can buy it and then immediately exchange it for whatever service/goods they require. The price of the bitcoin is really of no concern to them - what do they care if they get .00005 or 0.5 BTC for $100? They require $100 worth of BTC and this is what they get.

Dumping on downward movement and trying to re-enter at the bottom is a) greedy and b) probably not gonna work out (at least not repeatedly). 
I've got nothing against people who are "taking profit" by selling once/if BTC hits their target. Repeatedly dumping when the price start to fall, hoping to induce people (probably newbies and weak hands) into panic sells which will cause the price to go even lower, then trying to rebuy at the bottom is loathe-worthy in my eyes. Nothing illegal about it, but imo it's something that only those who see Bitcoin as a means to get rich would do, not those who are in BItcoin for its merits.
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:58:34
You're probably one of those highly learned economists whose best reply to why gold is seen as a store of value is "because there's always someone there to buy it if the moves down". 
To go over your dismissals of OP:
1.  The average user doesn't need to understand the technical details. What he needs to understand is that "having a bitcoin" is the digital equivalent of "having a paper dollar" in the physical world and the "giving someone your bitcoin" is the digital equivalent as "giving your paper dollar" isn the physical world. Read [this] ( Once you  realize this simple truth, it's very easy to understand why noone can give you back your stolen bitcoin or "rewind the transaction" or whatever. It's also easy to understand that your bitcoin is lost once someone gets a hold of your wallet. Your money is gone in the digital world just as in the physical.
2. Yes, bitcoin is tamperproof and completely unforgeable. User failure is not a failure of the system/network. To get back to the digital/physical parallels... If you lose your wallet with your USD, is that somehow a failure of the money? Or if you accidentally throw your cash in fire? Or if it gets eaten up by mice? Comparing bitcoin safety to how your money is safe in a bank is completely preposterous.
3. Bitcoin tx fees are terrible at the moment. This is where bitcoin is a victim of its own success and the tech has fallen behind demand. However solutions are coming. And lightning is a solution. I agree that there are tradeoffs to using lightning - the major one that it will definitely bring some centralization with it (hubs). But this doesn't devalue the bitcoin network in any way. I imagine keeping most of the funds in a conventional wallet and using some of them to fund a channel. Why is that a bad thing? Centralization in this aspect and concerning a limited amount of funds I chose to lock up in a channel doesn't affect any of the qualities that bitcoin gives me - namely decentralization, which is the prerequisite to resistance to censorship and ensuring a neutral vehicle for transferring wealth.
4. This gets brought up a lot, but i don't agree with this point. I've never in my life made a decision on whether to spend my money by thinking about inflation, or "i better get this now, beacuse I won't be able to afford it next year". I'm talking strictly about "operating expenses" not "investments" - of course you try to get rid of your fiat money by buying some assets for investment purposes, but the point you're trying to make revolves around day-to-day purchases (pizzas) not investments. Is forcing people into consumership and having them buy crap they don't really need what's keeping the economy up? If yes, is that really sound and sustainable + an argument against bitcoin?
5. and 6. Is completely dependent on social convention - meaning it all depends on what we agree upon. The more people have bitcoin, the broader this consensus becomes. Once a social consensus among a bigger group (critical mass) is reached, the price/value fluctuations will calm down and your points will be moot. You're basically saying "it's not a store of value, because it's not a store of value" and a logical fallacy as such. Again. Why is gold a better store of value than bitcoin? 


Complete bullshit.  
 Transaction fees: use onchain txs for moving bigger amounts, then fees are workable even at current network status. Offchain for smaller payments. How is this "unfixable" and "lacking in fundamental ways".  
Wallet protection: for general public - hardware wallets (and check onscreen what address you're sendign to). For advanced users - electrum cold storage/offline tx signing (explained [here]( ). *Mic drop*  
Validation waits - again. Non-issue with lightning. Wait 10 mins when you pay for a house. What's the issue here? Even 0 confirmation payments for smaller amounts are hardly an issue  - example: a customer uses his phone with Mycelium and pays for a grocery purchase. You can't even attempt a double spend with Mycelium which means the user would have to run out of the store and use another wallet to attempt a double-spend, all before his original tx is included in a block.   
Energy usage - this is a "necessary evil", but it's like that with everything. Christmas light? Watching cat videos with your computer? Sporting events with thousands of lights, cameras, transmitions? Playing hockey in Arizona? We might as well go back to the stone age and not use electricity...  
Exchange with existing monetary infrastructure - this is not a bitcoin network issue, but it is an issue concerning bitcoin. Exchanges should be appropriately regulated - meaning fund insurance, regular audits of security measures, transparency requirements, etc. Andreas Antononpolous has addressed this issue in his canadian senate hearing which was held way back in 2014.   
I am sceptical of the whole "bringing down the corrupt powers" mantra that sometimes accompanies bitcoin topics.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:50:40
Those forks follow another set of rules (a different protocol), which means they're forming a different network. Those networks have their own miners, developer community, userbase, exchanges, etc. Of course all cryptos server basically the same function, but it's up to users to chose the one they have the the most trust in. I believe bitcoin shows the most promise (from whave I've seen mostly from the developer community so far)  for what I believe to be a major function of cryptos - namely staying completely decentralized and thus censorship resistant in the future.

Any ingress/egress points to the bitcoin network will probably be regulated in the future (at least from a certain amount onwards, like 500 or 1000 USD) and required to collect personal information - like the exchanges voluntarily do already. But assigning transactions within the network to certain individuals will always be non-trivial + let's not forget those you can't stop/censor those - like Visa censored donations to Wikileaks for example.  
Another thing is the privacy feature of lightning, where payments are routed in similarly to tor traffic, which does ensure a high level of privacy/anonymity if wanted.

Stop "recruiting" people by persuading them to buy BTC. Tell them about what Bitcoin (the network and technology) is actually about, educate them about it being a worldwide distributed secure ledger, that can't be broken into nor have records falsified and educate them on merits of the system. 
If you just talk them into "investing", which they'll do by opening an account with Coinbase or some other exchange, wiring money over, hitting the "buy" button and then letting their BTC sit in their Coinbase account, they'll have learnt absolutely nothing about Bitcoin. It's only natural they'll panic at each negative price movement in this case. They're dealing with something they don't know and people generally fear the unknown. 
The price is the least interesting aspect of Bitcoin ffs! Spread the knowledge about Bitcoin and not the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:34:25
Saying bitcoin is "old tech" is false.
Faster confirmation times and bigger blocks do not make a coin technologically superior to bitcoin in any way. Plus you need to keep in mind that utilizing technology as an application for storing and transfering wealth around, it's always better to be prudent and conservative than "cutting edge". Bitcoin does what it's made to do (ensure a digital entry in the most secure - tamper proof, decentralized - censorship - proof and verifiably transfering that entry from one holder to another)  extremely well. On-chain scaling does not work in the long run + it necessarily brings along centralization with consern of succumbing to censorship. 
Saying bitcoin is "old tech" and then refering to litecoin is 2x false (not bashing litecoin, I have a bunch of them as well). Why? Because litecoin IS bitcoin (technology- and code-wise) , with a couple of variables changed - namely scrypt algorihtm instea of sha256, 4x the amount of total coins, 2.5 instead of 10 min block target time. 
Again.. Every coin that relies on a blockchain will have troubles with full blocks and transaction backlog, beacuse of the nature of blockchain, which has a limited space in the blocks. There are some coins that take a different approach (like IOTA with its "tangle"), but it remains to be seen how secure and viable their approach is and especially, if it's able to stay permanently censorship-proof.

"Wut" was in reference to you claiming it can only stabilize at 0. I'm not thinking/expecting it to stabilize absolutely (there's no absolutes in social/human sciences anyway). Stabilization in the context of Bitcoin is not having these wild 10%+ daily swings and settling (better word than stabilizing?) at like +5% yearly rate in relation to fiat nominal value.


Yes, it is. It's a computer network protocol, which can be changed at will. But this requires a hard fork with broad consensus or you'll just get another "Bcash".

 I completely agree with what this dude said:
*You can build a fast, efficient payment network on top of Gold 2.0 ... but you can't build a censorship resistant, non-systemic store of value on top of PayPal 2.0*
Bitcoin might have started out as a vehicle for fast, cheap payments (very doubtful on this: check the msg embedded into the genesis block), but it's grown into something more now. TX capacity will get resolved, but it shouldn't come at the price of potentially endangering censorship resistance and neutrality of the bitcoin network.

I'm not thinking the "bubble will never burst" as in I believe we'll see a significant "correction" sooner or later. No idea if this happens at 20,30,50 or 100K. I'm guessing once the rocket stalls at a certain price for a significant amount of time, all those who only got on board for "the sick gainz", will start jumping off, which will bring the price down to a lower plateau.
Regarding the 2013/2014 crash; keep in mind that 2 major factors brought the market down then. MtGox fuckup + Chinese ban (banks weren't allowed to transact with exchanges). I know this sounds like a meme on this subreddit, but things ARE different this time.

I agree there'll always be an incentive to hoarding bitcoin - but you can say that for all appreciating assets. People are trying to grow their wealth (or at least preserve it) by investing in real property, stocks, bonds,  gold, art, antiquities, music instruments, etc..  
This brings me to my main point. I don't see the value of bitcoin stemming from it being "a currency". A bitcoin (BTC, the unit that we move around the bitcoin network) is a digital currency - one that cannot be copied, one that you can verifiably transfer to someone else, one that cannot be forged. That's it. That's what bitcoin - the unit - is to me and that's why it's worth something. And in this context, bitcoin IS backed by something - the bitcoin network itself. How much this unit is worth in relation to other things/assets (how many dollars/euros it costs) is entirely up to the people to decide. 
I don't believe that BTC will replace any fiat currency, nor do i wish it does that. It can however co-exist alongside and function as a "store of value" (due to it's  deflationary nature) and as a medium of exchange that closely mimics a physical exchange on a digital level (you hand over a bitcoin to someone, like people have been handing over shells, salt, grains of gold, coins and paper for centuries).

True.  
However, this will change somewhat with 2nd layer solutions + there's no denying that tracing a BTC transaction to an individual today is a much more time and resource consuming chore than simply pressing a button in a bank's system. The latter one enables complete surveillance without giving it too much thought ("Oh? You already collect everything in nice a little database, that ties each transaction to a person? Neat. Yeah.. We'd like access to that please.") wherein the former one doesn't.

What the hell are you talking about? Bitcoin's scaling/transaction capacity has absolutely nothing to do with number of miners and energy costs. The whole network can manage the same number of transactions with current hashing power or 1/100th of it. I'm shocked that you don't know this even though you claim of being into Bitcoin for the "exciting idea of a revolutionary technology, and its applications in the real world". 
I understand what you're saying about the direction that this subreddit's taken with these price increases and I don't like the memes and "OMG! Bitcoin made me rich, I'm so happy posts" either, but I fail to see how they affect me. I'm in Bitcoin for the same reasons you claim to be and I'll still be here even if the price crashes by 10K or something (I survived the 2013-2014 crash, I'll survive this), because *the price is the least interesting thing about Bitcoin*. You leaving because of the mindset of most of this subreddit - people who will probably panic sell on the first 20% drop, causing further drops - only tells me that you actually care about *price too much*.

All of hashrate won't vanish overnight. If most miners go off to mine another coin, the difficulty will eventually fall - this will ensure there's not a lasting block-creation standstill and bringing back 10 minute between blocks. Mining power should become more dispersed in the coming months with GMO and Dragonmint miners. Besides, even with 51% + hashing power, the miner cannot wholly control the network (mostly enables him to double-spend his own coins and block some tx from confirming), and he definitely can not change the consensus rules on his own.
Bitcoin, as an open-source protocol, with an open-source reference wallet that's built by a dispersed team of developers (some even anonymous or at least unknown) is infinetly less likely to get censored than a single-entity "owned" (via patented and prioprietary tech) coin/network. Let's say the US and the EU decide that "only transfer of crypto-coins between wallets, belonging to users who have had their identity checked and confirmed by official agents/exchanges". This would certainly be doable tech-wise. But imagine which network would actually comply with such a demand. Bitcoin or SuperDuperFastNcheapCoinZ by DisruptingTheFinanceWorld Inc.?
I don't see lightning hubs as a threat to neutrality and censorlesness of the network. First I hear about needing 100MB blocks for reaching visa levels with LN. I know the estimate was 133MB blocks if 7 bil people made 2 channels per year, but the TXs inside such a channel would be unlimited. Keep in mind that this estimate was made in 2015 and some later developments led to size optimization. And I don't think 7 billion people will actually use bitcoin - if we say 2.3 billion used bitcoin, that would bring us to 44.33 MB blocks, which is much more acceptable.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:33:40
1 GB block enough for the world population conducting 50tx/day?   
The current tx/s is about 5 with 1 MB blocks, With 1GB blocks, this would ideally go up to 5000 tx/s.  5000*86400=432000000 (432 million) transactions per day is all you get. That's like 2 tx per adult US citizen per day.   
Not to mention 1GB block is huge anyway. It would take almost 1:30 minute to download a 1GB block on a 1 mbps line. Can you imagine what disadvantage a remote miner has to the one that solved the previous block or to the one in the same datacenter as this miner?

Banking the unbanked doesn't mean giving them bitcoin so they can use it as you'd use a credit card (buying groceries, coffee, whatever).. It enables their communities access to funding without a bank as an intermediary. Let's say a village wants to build a well, or a sports hall, or a school and they need to raise funds for this. The immigrants from this village can send their contributions directly to the community and people from all over the world can send donations directly.  Peer to peer doesn't necessarily mean individual to individual.

If there's someone who's enforcing the patent and thus controlling the network, then his alternative is not doing the exact same as bitcoin. 
It's not all about **current** security, neutrality and non-censorship of the network (and definitely not about "fast and cheap payments"). It's about **lasting** security, neutrality and censor-proofness. Any shitcoin can provide the former, which one beside bitcoin can ensure the latter?

Some of the those criminals even have the audacity to store these in a bank security box and are thus abusing the services our banks offer. What do they need that for? They can put it all on an account and just use the funds from there. Nevermind if their transfer to idk, Bolivia gets blocked because *someone* feels it's suspicious. And in case they want to buy a used car in a private sale, we better make sure to give them a lengthy questionnaire on how they've accrued their funds.. It's only reasonable - to prevent terrorism and money laundering. IF they have nothing to hide, they'll surely disclose all what's required. And for THE LOVE OF GOD, WON'T SOMEONE PLEASE THINK OF THE CHILDREN?!

Except in most of the EU where it's basically illegal for businesses to accept paper money (cash) for any payment of a significant amount. And let's not forget about India, where they've demonetised 500 and 1000 rupee notes. Oh.. and we're doing the same in the EU with the 500€ note. 
But hey... It's all because we're fighting corruption, money laundering, preventing terrorism and going after tax avoiders. Eventually, there will be no more corruption, no more money laundering, no more terrorism and no more tax avoidance, beacuse we'll have JUST digital money, which our financial institutions will keep for us (for a small fee, forget any interest) and it'll all be under the scrutiny of the all-knowing, do-no-wrong, government, who only strives to take the best care of all its citizens (collectively and individually).

Not currently, but it's certainly not completely out of the question in the future.


 
Noone said the price increase is because of people who want bitcoin to donate. As everything it comes down mostly to selfish reasons - meaning people speculating, wanting to get rich.


Define rich and tiny number. Definitely more than a tiny number of people are experiencing considerable gains in fiat currency. Speculation and price discovery, which will eventually lead to stabilization = price having been discoverd. Besides.. Bitcoin can even be "something a tiny number of people are getting rich from specualting on" AND a "tool for the poor man", not one OR the other. 
Regarding price discovery, speculation and getting rich from it.  
 Are you aware that a troy ounce of gold was less than $40 in 1972? Even adjusted for inflation that's ~ $240 today, while its market price is $1320?  
 Are you aware that gold dropped from $615 in 1980 to $317 in 1985? Terrible store of value by SirBastian's criteria.

No need for condescending replies.  
The future might not look exactly like Demolition man, but that scene depicts (in a comedic and amplified way of course) where we might end up IF we willingly give up too much of our privacy. 
And financial privacy is a cornerstone to privacy itself. At the moment, cash still provides our financial privacy, but for how long? The calls for "going all digital" are getting louder and louder, the EU has already almost outlawed cash. I sure don't expect any government/bank issued digital currencies (tokens, whatever) will have built-in privacy as a feature -  it'll rather be the other way around; i.e. complete and total traceability and accountability of every transaction within this (only one government allowed/certfified) payment system. Autonomous, censorship-proof cryptocurrencies/crypotassets are the only acceptable cash alternatives for a purely digital era.

The fees are something that's gonna get fixed. People making huge returns on bitcoin doesn't disqualify bitcoin's utlity in any way. You pointing this out just makes you sound sour.




Bitcoin isn't a currency per se either. The bitcoin system is a computer protocol and a BTC is a digital record in this system. What function people assign to it, is entirely up to the people. Most industrial demand for gold comes from jewelry and tech manufacturers, but that's not what dictates gold's price nowadays.


This is a non-argument against bitcoin. Bitcoin goes up in value for the same reasons - lots of people want it (for different reasons/motivation), it's "naturally scarce" and it's hard to produce (only by mining). However, unlike gold, there's not gonna be any asteroid mining of bitcoin in the future so not everyone will have as much as they like (this likely won't happen with gold either, because the miners will keep it artifically scarce, just like they do with diamonds).


Agreed, but it's still a huge price swing. I think most of us who believe in the positive attributes of bitcoin wish for less volatily (that's why i mentioned price stabilization in my previous reply).

Terrible analogy, terrible comments.
It's not like a credit card stolen, it's not like a bank hacked and your account emptied... 
In regards to security, Bitcoin is like a physical vehicle of value - exactly like cash, gold or other precious things. If you keep this physical vehicle with someone/store it somewhere and it gets stolen from that place, who's going to give that thing back to you? Law enforcement and courts if they find the culprit and the stolen thing itself, otherwise you're out of luck and need to rely on getting your claim through against whoever was storing the thing for you.  If that someone is insured (like banks/credit unions are in the conventional financial system) or that someone has enough of his own assets (again, like banks usually have), you're more than likely to be reimbursed for your loss, otherwise you're SOL. 
Come on people. This isn't that hard to figure out.

It means on-chain (1st layer) scaling isn't feasible in the long run and a 2nd layer scaling solution will have to be implemented. In order to facilitate tens of thousands transactions per second, you'd need a block in hundreds of gigabytes, which would bring along centralisation in full nodes as well as cut off smaller miners (due to network latency and orphan blocks that this would bring). 
Even with 8MB blocks, bitcoin would face same tx congestion in a couple of months. 
For crying out loud, even Nick Szabo and Daniel Buchner (head of Decentralized identity foundation) spoke about this:

I don't think anyone considers talking about negatives an attack, but the sheer amount and repetition of the same damn topics over and over again is fucking annoying. 
YES! Bitcoin is currently almost unusable as a means of exchange due to fees.  
NO! There's no **immediate** solution in sight (some relief could come if more ppl switched to segwit addresses). Solutions are coming, mostly in the form of Lightning + other advances. 
STOP! demanding solutions. Bitcoin isn't a company, it's an open-source project. That means ANYONE can contribute. Got an idea? Great! Go to github and submit your code.  
If you need/want  to transact with a crypto, use another coin. In choosing this other coin, keep in mind, that BCash is backed by people who purposely impeded the deployment of segwit (one of the main technical advances and a condition for most of the proposed 2nd layer scaling solutions) on the main bitcoin network for months if not years. And all exclusively for their own monetary benefit! I'd personally use Litecoin as that at least has a benevolent dictator, not a blinded fanatic and a bunch of greedy deceiving characters as its backers.

The miners will get back to mining BTC in ~3 hours when BCH's difficulty adjustment kicks in and mining BTC will be 2x more profitable for miners (at current price - check  ). This will ensure that BTC block finding time gets back to normal, which is 10 mins. However irregardles of this, since a block only holds ~ 2500 TXs, it will take long time for the backlog to clear.

Not that I'm saying BTC won't be perfectly useful for *microtransactions* after 2nd layer solutions are implemented, but even if BTC was mostly used as a storage of value that wouldn't make it useless and worthless. A decentralized, censorship-proof, secure ledger where you hold your own account of a scarce asset that cannot be falsified IS worth a lot. 
And even in its current state, BTC is perfectly usable as an exchange medium, only not for all and any exchanges (perfectly usable for buying a TV, not so much a coffee). 
And saying that Bitcoin is inferior to Ethereum is just laughable.

What are you talking about - "you can't separate a wallet from the Bitcoin"? You can have unlimited copies of a wallet (each on a different device for example) and all of these copies "hold" the same Bitcoin. How? Well, exactly because the wallet doesn't really hold the Bitcoin, it's rather just a storage of your keys an interface which allows you to use these keys in interaction with the bitcoin network.

Besides...  Bitcoin is still MUCH, MUCH, MUCH...., MUCH, more usable as a medium of exchange than gold and still has that advantage. Can you buy a $1000  TV with gold?

I'm none of these fuckers and I'm tired of having to explain to my bank what the source of the funds that've been lying in my deposit account for 10 years is, just because I want to withdraw a larger sum of cash (actually happened to me in my EU bank!!).
FATF and the EU comission and parliament and all the members states can go to hell for crippling the ability to actually do business with cash in the EU. And I can only see it getting worse and worse. 
Privacy is my right and I've a right noone knows what I buy, pay for, or who i donate to. We need private means of transacting and that's where I see the strength of decentralized cryptos.

IMO these support/resistance thresholds mean very little or at least less than it may seem, because they're fluid as fuck. Once the price starts dropping/rising rapidly, the bots fire up and move their buy/sell orders in the blink of an eye.

I agree with everything you wrote and I am in no way a BCH advocate, but I would like to point out this:
Ver and Jihan are hellbent on running BCH and they're very wealthy. * Judging by r/btc, they've managed to gather quite a horde of followers. Realistically speaking, "normal" users don't really care all too much about technical background of bitcoin, importance of decentralization, etc., (stupid, i know, but we're talking about gen. pop. here) the most important thing to them are low fees for fast transactions (which BCH currently does offer and BTC does not - let's not be in denial).
My point is... The above circumstances make me believe BCH does have a future and short/mid term it will thrive and I'm afraid this will be at the expense of BTC. Long term BTC will and has to come out as winner, but our honeybadger is in for a rough ride.
*edit: They can probably afford to keep BCH running and its price at a profitable level on their own.

- BTC is / was last couple of days at an ATH,
- BCH is backed by people who hold a lot of BTC,
- these same people (at least Roger Ver, who himself owns tens of thousands of BTC) have publicly announced that they're moving over to BCH completely (check the posts regarding bitcoin.com going BCH only)
Now.. BCH backers really have NOTHING lose by dumping their BTC. Even if their intentions fail (BCH replacing BTC as "Bitcoin"), they've still racked up a shit ton of money by selling at an ATH. And if their plan works, their win is even bigger = they've taken all of your BTC money + Bitcoin itself.
We shouldn't brush this attack off as something as simple as "fake bot trading volume".

You're not really having a conversation, you're making an assertion based on a false premise. A wallet does not store the bitcoin, just like the key to the vault in Voltaristotle's example doesn't store the gold itself (nor does having the key on you equate to having the gold on you). Sure, losing the one thing that enables access to another thing leads to the same result as losing the latter itself, but it doesn't magically make these two separate objects identical.

Dumping btc in batches of 100+ at a time has nothing to do with depleted order books.
Uh-oh, btc is at 10500? Time to drive the price down. BAM, here's 112 btc. 1 minute later, BAM, here's another 100 btc. 
What rational seller would be dropping btc in batches, WITHOUT any negative outside info? If his intention was maximizing profits from the sale of these particular bitcoins, he'd sell them off in smaller numbers over time. But selling these particular bitcoins for max. profit isn't his intention - he wants to maximize his overall profit by driving the price down and then up again - selling 1k at $10K//bitcoin, hopefully creating snowball effect, thus driving the price down to let's say $8,5K, then buying 1K at this price, causing another snowball effect, driving the price up, selling.. etc. etc. Basically rinse/repeat. The problem is amplified by all the bot traders (especially the newbie bot traders, whose bots are set up in a predictable manner, so the true trader whales know how to play them). 
This will stop (or at least be mitigated) once (and if) bitcoin reaches a much higher price and these so called "whales" won't be able to cause such market moves and once the main exchanges (public and taking fiat) impose their own rules or or have such rules forced onto them.

Wash trading is someone selling/buying to himself (or a smaller number of participants acting together). Selling/buying within an exchange is not wash trading.

You don't understand... He was offered to mine bitcoin before you'd even heard about it. He's like the OG of bitcoin brah. He's knows all about it, don't give him that shit. 
IMO, he's shitting on bitcoin while quietly buying up while it's cheap. It's what the Wolf would do.

1. The core development team is much more than Blockstream.
2. Blockstream are a bunch of computer scientists/nerds. BCH is mostly [these guys]( and [this guy]( I believe the computer nerds will do what's best for the project they're working on, while the other guys will do what's best for their own pockets + the BCH guys strike me as someone who always wants more and more $$$.

Where does it say anything about hodling forever? It's about being a bad trader, while good traders can spot highs and lows and, it's about weak hands panic selling and then panic buying back in at a higher price. It's a rant against day trading.

Bitcoin's congestion was just used as an excuse to bring Bcash to life under the false pretense of ensuring "fast and cheap payments". The real reason was an attempt of corporate takeover of bitcoin. I have no doubt Bitmain was the main actor behind it, heavily backed by major bitcoin businesses - with Coinbase being at the front (the way how Bcash was introduced, taking forever to implement segwit, not using batching, statements from B. Armstrong regarding the core developers being the "biggest systemic risk to bitcoin"). I'm not sure of Ver's motives in all of this, but I suspect he's trully convinced bitcoin's raison d'etre is fast and cheap payments, which he believes bcash solves. This could have led the other, truly malevolent, players to abuse him and his position and influence somewhat (this isn't a justified  excuse for  what he's doing in any way, don't get me wrong).

I hurt bitcoin by holding through this dip and seeing 100K+ losses (in relation to ATH?). Or are the ones who dump immediately on bad news/downwards movement, hoping to rebuy back in at a lower entry hurting bitcoin? Moon/lambo crap is coming from all the new "inverstors" who only see bitcoin as a get rich quickly scheme.

That's all from me folks. :)
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:16:56
Yeah. Sell now and rebuy at lower price point. And everyone else should speculate like that and do the same. That will really make bitcoin stable and useful for everyone.
Speculate and hopefully get rekt. Then stay out. Bye.

In other words - you wanted to get rich quick ("been here since june 2017" - speaking like you're some old-timer), but the mean boys didn't let you so now you're taking your toys and going home? 
And you're not only leaving.. Oh no.. You're trolling on your way out, posting about "support" at 600 and thinking about shorting. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 14:23:28
Look... I understand you're just trying to do what's in your best financial interest. But if everyone keeps dumping and "buying dips", then bitcoin will never achieve any level of stability. Price oscillations are what make bitcoin a speculative instrument and it shouldn't be that in the long-term. The market needs to discover the "true price" and then bitcoin will have all the characteristics of money.

Let me share another SOBER point. Bitcoin is not a get rich quickly scheme. Being in RED for a month is completely irrelevant if you keep in mind that this is world changing tech and social/economic/political movement. 
Besides... High volume selling over the past 8 hours tells us jack shit.

Only shows that the currently apparent  bitcoin crash is the result of manipulation/planned dumping.  
@_date: 2018-02-24 07:18:37
This isn't normal profit taking. It's dumping to drive the price lower then rebuying at that lower price = price manipulation. I'll laugh my ass off when the first of these "whales" gets sent to jail/fined heavily. Even if it's not a statutory regulated market, cryptocurrencies are an (autonomously) organized market and pump'n'dumps in such markets can definitely get classified as breaking the rules (at least using legal analogies). 
Have fun while it lasts boys. Invest some of those profits in lube though.

Central bank/state digital money would be the death of the little privacy we have left. All of your financial transfers logged for eternity and they can be brought up any time with the press of a button. Scary shit.

I'm sure he was referring to the Coincheck heist, where $500+ mil of NEM was stolen.

BCH is redundant at best. But you're probably right...  It's mostly scam/garbage.
As for Ver... He should at least "close down" by disabling any new posts an permanently stickying a redirect post to a sub that actually has some connection to BCH. As it stands now, is just there to bash BTC and pump BCH. This is highly confusing for people and all this cross-shitting and -bashing makes the whole crypto-space look highly juvenile and amateurish. And secondly... His (and his cohorts' and buddies') coin is called Bitcoin cash, so call it Bitcoin cash. If they want that coin to succeed they should point out the merits and advantages it has over bitcoin (BTC). At the moment, the advantages are non-existent. The difference is much less hashing power securing BCH, blocksize+++ (which is NOT a lasting scaling solution) and no segwit. Oh.. And no proven developers and their plan consists of "we'll wait what the BTC developers come up with and if it works, we'll copy it off them".

It's quite obvious that bashing bitcoin on this sub is your job and that's why you're terrible at doing your job. Spreading FUD should be done with subtlety not forcefully as you're doing it. You fail. 
About the usefulness and importance of bitcoin - read this first link here:  (Explain Bitcoin Like I'm Five). Bitcoin is basically a material digital asset and that's what's revolutionary about it. If you don't see it, you don't see it. Too bad for you. What it enables (independent and permissionless transfer and storage of value) is important today and it will get even more important with time - especially once paper money/cash is abolished. Without bitcoin (or some other autonomous cryptocurrency) we'll then be living in a world, where ALL our transactions are recorded, meaning in a world of totalitarian surveillance. Fuck that.

His post wasn't "reactionary" nor did he try to discredit The Infependent in any way, he simply posted on what Coinbase reported on this matter (with included quotes from various exchanges).
Besides... I don't see why a probe/investigation/inquiry of the exchanges by the NY AG should be perceived as negative for bitcoin (as your post implies). Exchanges should be (thoughtfully) regulated and held accountable.

Bitcoin is "banned" in China and now India.. And Bangladesh, Colombia, Bolivia, ... ? 
So it's "banned" in countries that stand out as democratic and modern countries with governments that have a long tradition of looking after the rights and freedom of their citizens. Right? Oh wait..
I find it absurd that there's even a discussion on the legality of having an entry in a public ledger that's run autonomously by free people. Because that's what bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) basically is. A goddamn entry in a goddamn public ledger! Banks are supposed to somehow have a monopoly on this and the para-governmental bodies (central banks) are able to forbid us this freedom?

 &gt;  Being protected from market manipulation
Keep in mind that what matters to crypto traders isn't necessarily what's good for crypto. Traders love volatility - that's how they make gains (or losses). Exchanges love volatily as well, since volatility brings volume and volume means business and $$$ for the exchange (and Kraken is an exchange). 
IMO no safeguards against market manipulation and the wild price swings this brings is terrible for Bitcoin per se (as a medium of exchange and as store of value).
