Yes it will happen , atleast that is what i think . Thats why diversify ! 
I am in the same boat as you.
Take a chance at some high risk potential 100/1000x coins .
Some months back i bought in some crappy ico  called ucash put in about $200 , for a while nothing... then it got added on some crappy exchange and mooned to 0.20 before plummeting back way below 0.01 man it was the best ride ever and i walked out with $6000 !
Just put a small amount like 20% in high risk coins and play the russian roulette !

Well..... Suprise... all exchanges do... and some much higher then you did pay

Nah in the older post binance even suggested him contacting local law enforcers I think this guy is hiding something. So far binance has been transparant about this case 
@_date: 2018-12-09 07:22:20
Awesome! 
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:47:49
About 1 month ago you said your lawyer was busy with it. Now 1 month later you come back complain about it. You should get a better lawyer if you still know nothing it is not a bag of peanuts we talking about. 
Still I do have the same questions as 1 month ago why did u edit binance their response when u posted it here? 
Don't say you don't because binance placed the original message in your last post.. 
What are you hiding?
@_date: 2018-12-30 17:26:59
Think he just lied to you.. Checking these  your returns seem normal well could be a little bit higher but not much. For you I hope you did not pay $3000 for this lol u never get it back
