I don't believe that is necessarily so. Just because someone works hard, it is no indication or guarantee that they can make a living out of it.

No, stealing is wrong; I only duplicate stuff.


In as much as I would give a shit about someone who said to me "Well, it's 2016, I've decided to make my living as a chimney sweep". I mean, you voluntarily get into a career with a widely known issue (freely available duplication), and then complain about the issue? It shouldn't be a surprise...

Yes it can. There are plenty of scenarios, but here's just one:
Bank has 2 BTC in reserve.
It lends 1 to Bob, and 1 to Alice.
Alice then decides to spend her 1 BTC on financial advice, oh and guess who sells financial advice? Yep, her bank. So she trades that coin for advice, and subsequently *still owes the bank 1 BTC*.
The bank, with this 1 BTC, makes a loan to Fred.
Viola! Bank has 3 BTC worth of loans on its books, and this could work even if there were only ever 2 bitcoins in existence in the entire world.
@_date: 2015-06-07 22:40:25

The bigger savings come from hiring full-time workers (i.e. employees), rather than contractors. For this (especially if you have many other projects going on), I'd recommend searching on  with the proviso that the first thing you test prospective employees on, is their English skills. Another top priority is to make sure they have a decent working environment and internet connection, particularly in the Philippines where on average they have some of the worst internet in the world.

Yes they could.
First, Fred and Bob pay back the physical bitcoins they have to the bank.
Then, the bank needs to pay rent, right? Maybe Alice happens to be their landlord!
So they pay their rent (1 BTC to Alice) and she promptly pays back her loan.
It doesn't really take much of an imagination. This was just an immediate off-the-top-of-my-head example, but there'd be a million other scenarios.

Let's say only 1 bitcoin exists in the entire world, and there is not even any such thing as banks.
I can legitimately owe you, my friend, 100 bitcoins, *and*, I can pay back the debt.
Every Wednesday, I pay back 1 bitcoin off the loan, and every Saturday you pay me 1 bitcoin to mow your lawn.
100 weeks later, the debt is paid.
This argument goes back to when people used to say 21 million bitcoins isn't enough for a global financial system, when in reality the entire world could run off just 1 bitcoin, even if that bitcoin weren't particularly divisible.

Second idea: You could try running a 'blind' survey where you ask people to submit their top 5 companies, without giving them multiple choice, just a text box, and without showing the results until you've gathered everyone's submissions.
For this though, you'd have to think carefully about your target, (e.g. do you want this to only be USA or global).
Ultimately of course, it's up to you to first define 'notable'... what is the purpose of your query?

Go into a store that you're certain *doesn't* take bitcoin. Choose many high value items and let the cashier scan it all and add it up. Then, when they're standing there waiting for payment, pull out your phone and start looking around for a QR code, with a confused look on your face and say "Where do I send the bitcoins to?" then when they tell you they don't accept bitcoins / say "what's a bitcoin?", yell out to some accomplice / imaginary person outside the store "They don't take bitcoins!" "WHAT?!"  "I SAID, THEY DON'T TAKE BITCOINS HERE!". Then leave without buying anything.

Even if the entire world runs on 'bitcoins', not everyone will need the real thing, because fractional reserve banks will create bitcoin IOUs that will satisfy a large portion of the market. If most consumers can spend these 'faux bitcoins' on their daily needs, then having the real thing is only necessary for the people who are not into trusting centralization in the first place - and that fraction of the global population will continue to remain small IMO.

Bitcoin is the best thing since sliced cucumber. It allows people to take control of their own finances, rather than rely (and trust) third-party organizations such as banks. Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer payment system, which means that funds are sent directly from one user to another, without needing to go through a middleman. Sort of like physical cash, except that it can be transferred over the net almost instantly. 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, and with little to no fees. This type of monetary system is resistant to theft by governments and other criminal organizations as it exists simply as data, which users can easily encrypt. In addition, there is a mathematically ensured hard limit of 21 million bitcoins that will ever exist, ensuring no run-away inflation or 'quantitative thieving' of individuals' wealth.

I don't know how it works in the US, but in Australia, you don't have to personally be on someone's property to 'trespass'.

I don't 'take' things.  


Credit card fraud is one part of free markets, yes - and a truly free market is the only definition I can equate to 'fair'. As for "are the right people getting paid", supply-and-demand theory leads me to conclude that there is no other possibility. Money will always end up in the hands of whoever provides the most value. Ultimately I don't think the question has any meaning; it's like asking if a string is the 'right' length.

The latest Bitcoin Core (previously known as Bitcoin QT) has what's called 'Coin Control', where you can pick which transaction *inputs* to use to fund a transaction that you're about to send. (For more info on input/outputs, have a quick read of [bitcoinfees.com]( By choosing specific inputs, you can more easily keep the transaction under 1000 bytes and use coins that are of 'low-medium' or higher priority, meaning you can get your transaction sent with 0 fee. On the other hand, if you just let it pick them for you automatically, it might just pick coins that result in you having to pay a fee.

The other thing some people want is to grow an economy. Note that in the example I gave, we can have an economy worth at least 2 coins, even where only 1 physical coin exists. This is why even if bitcoins weren't infinitely divisible, we could still run the entire world economy on bitcoins, using fractional-reserve banking. In this way, most 'bitcoin balances' wouldn't be readily redeemable for actual bitcoins, and this is what a lot of people dislike about fractional-reserve banking in the first place.

A deaf couple had been dating for a while, and finally got married. On their wedding night, they went into the bedroom and turned off the lights for the first time. Because they couldn't see each other "talking", things got confusing quite quickly.
The next morning, they sit down to talk about better ways to communicate. The wife says "Ok, so if we're in the bedroom, and you want to have sex, reach over and squeeze my left breast once. If you don't want to have sex, reach over and squeeze my left breast twice." The husband thinks about it, then says "Ok. If we're in the bedroom and YOU want to have sex, reach over and pull on my penis once. If you don't want to have sex, reach over and pull on my penis 150 times."

That number was only an example, and would only take 1 second to bruteforce if you had 1.4 TH/s capability. You'd need to use a VERY large number. I guess it would be a challenge to get the timing right; too big and you might be waiting 700 years for payday. Too small and you might get it in 7 hours.

If you didn't buy a ticket then you're usually last in line, until eventually you've been waiting on the platform so long that you push your way through to the front anyway.
 explains this concept where transaction age makes a difference to getting into a block, even where no fee has been added.
Bottom line, market forces (the price of tickets / transaction fees) will balance demand for transactions getting into a block.

The client tells you. On the **Send** page, click [**Inputs**]. Then when you're selecting the inputs, it tells you how many **Bytes** the transaction is going to take and calculates the fee for you, before anything has been sent. If any of your *outputs* are less than 0.01, you'll probably incur a fee regardless of how big or old your inputs are.

Exactly - hoarding is just another word for saving. I don't really see it as a problem that needs solving. No matter how much bitcoin is tied up by hoarders/savers, the economy will run just fine on whatever remainder is available to the market, because even though there is a finite amount, bitcoins are infinitely divisible, so a loaf of bread could end up being 0.000000000000001 for example, way off in the future.

This is what I was thinking. You *could* bruteforce faster with many machines in parallel, but then that would cost you more money to do so.
One way I thought of to do this was make your passphrase from a large number + random chars, eg (1402394334432 + abcxyzblahblahblah). Then delete all traces of the number, but keep the random chars somewhere safe. Now to spend these coins, you basically have to start at (1 + abcxyzblahblahblah) and keep incrementing until you find the money.

Whether that was the intention or not, it was not designed that way. There is absolutely nothing in bitcoin's code tying any of it to individual human conciousness.

a) have a shitload of stuff that needs shredded
b) don't have 8 hours to sit around all day with your home shredder
c) can't trust anyone else with the data
So the thing I can't figure out is, why are there no document-destruction companies that let you witness or physically take part in the destruction. Every single one of them says "okay, staff will take it from this point, behind this closed door, but trust us". Surely they could charge more to have the paranoid physically possess the object right up until the point it gets placed in the shredder.

The bank also owns a debt theoretically worth 1 coin (the loan to Alice) but this cannot be solidly relied on, if both Bob and Jane want to withdraw their 1 coin at the same time.
The bank is only holding a *fraction* of the total deposits in *reserve*.
Bitcoin does not automatically eliminate (the need for) fractional-reserve banking. It can work in exactly the same way as current fiat banks work.

The only reason I brought up the point is because I was explaining why I don't like to keep my wealth in USD or other government currency. Because the aim is to accumulate as many BTC as I can, so I prefer to have a stable BTC balance while I'm sleeping, and trade in/out of whatever during the day.

He is trying, but no, it's not needed. Bitcoin would work just fine with a capacity of only 100 transactions per day, so the current 50,000 - 80,000 is plenty. This may naturally drive the price of transactions to a point that you can't afford one - in that case it's time to look for an alternative, like doing something off-chain.

Satoshi has a well-established identity. I assume what you're referring to is a government-endorsed a.k.a 'real life' identity, but I don't see why so many people place importance on that attribute.

Let's take a moment to compare it to *Deepbit*. I think it's basically just that once a pool gets big, it's more likely to attract the new miners to it, and get bigger. As a complete novice, I went for Deepbit, simply because that was the 'most talked about', most posted about mining pool, and other newbs were doing the same thing. Don't know what ever happened to it because I didn't keep mining.

In fact it has 100% the exact same volatility when compared to bitcoin. This is why I don't want to hold USD overnight, because its value (compared) to bitcoin can fluctuate too much. If I keep 1 BTC for example, I know when I wake up it'll still be 1 BTC. If I hold 1 USD overnight, I have no idea how much that dollar will be worth (in BTC) in the morning.

@_date: 2014-06-09 13:35:27
Well, let's use an example. Say I need to send someone 1 BTC. On my send dialogue in Bitcoin Core, I go to **Inputs...** and select my inputs manually. Let's say I have an input that is 1.5 BTC, so I choose that. Now, normally, this would result in me getting 0.5 BTC to a change address.
Okay, so in addition to that input, I also select a couple of my very tiny ones. For example, say I also select 0.00000040 and 0.00000005.
Now the change is going to be 0.50000045 instead and I've cleaned up two of my dust inputs. The only problem with that example is that it'd charge me 0.0001, making it not worth it.
So basically I only ever include them if it doesn't change my fee (eg. if my transaction was going to cost me 0.0001 anyway, or if it's going to be a free transaction I can sometimes sneak in a couple of '0.001' inputs and still keep the tx under the limit).
I've gotten so used to choosing my own inputs now, that this process only takes me a couple extra seconds when I'm making a payment.

The other possibility (I've noticed with btc-e.com for example), is that the 0.5 might not be showing in your balance if it has been reserved for a limit order. Have you placed any orders on the exchange for 0.5 BTC (even orders that may not have been triggered yet)?

The point is, people who could afford to invest 4 years ago, can still afford to invest. There has been no decline in affordability in that sense. If the price of luxury cars goes up 9x, people can't easily go out and buy 1/10th of a luxury car. But if the price of bitcoin goes up, even 1000x, people can still buy in just as easily as they could before.

Why? With that logic, they'd get all or nothing. Why not spread the risk and offer slightly different amounts for each block, so they win anywhere between 1 and 10 blocks?  
**Edit:** After re-reading this, I realised my own logic has failed; it is possible to win anywhere from 0 to 10 blocks even if you bid the same amount per block.  e.g. I bid $600 and 5 people bid above $600 for 1 block each, I'd win 5 blocks. Still, having said all that, my strategy still would have been to offer differing amounts.

Perhaps if you never EVER use the 'optional' note. They will scrutinise every word of it for reasons to not let your payment reach its recipient.
Once, I was sending to "person a" and in the note, I wrote something like "Hi!, $25 of this payment is for Person B!".
Well, Paypal read that and I had to go through all this drama detailing exactly who person b is, and if they are 18+, etc. - With proof of age and address, and basically all the formal ID requirements just because of what I had written in a note that's *optional*. If I had just sent the exact same payment with no note it wouldn't have been a problem, could have informed Person A over skype or something.

@_date: 2015-01-21 03:24:36
It's quite irrelevant anyway; being a bitcoin expert does not make one an expert in economics (^(neither does a degree in economics, but that's another matter). Bitcoin would work perfectly fine even with a 512kb maximum block size, mining only 10 blocks per day. The only constraint is that some people wouldn't be able to afford to make *on-chain* transactions, but those people can use *off-chain* aggregators.
@_date: 2015-05-11 03:44:35
How? By having a high risk tolerance. It should be noted however that the risk of having my bitcoin 'accounts' frozen or stolen is far lower than for fiat accounts. With respect to bitcoin, dollars are just as volatile... I've played BTC-e for a while, and having any large portion of funds in USD makes it difficult to sleep at night. I do make trades that end with me having a larger USD position, but I don't generally like sleeping on such a position... I 'cash out' to crypto before the end of each day. Opposite for some people.

I pay them via PayPal, it doesn't cost *me* anything. The part of rebit that I have a problem with is "Sender pays for the transfer with BTC". To be honest, the complication is the accounting... paying with paypal draws it from my AUD bank account, so the accounting is easy.

i.e. Your argument still goes both ways - it's the exact same thing that's happening.

Whether you call it a sell or a buy is irrelevant.

The thing is, I'd have to account for the BTC exactly on my tax paperwork, which is something that is currently still a bit of guess work as to how it should be done. If I already had BTC to pay, I'd have to work out how spending that BTC directly can be properly listed as a legitimate tax deduction and at what value and what date and time. At the moment, spending AUD is obviously less complicated from that perspective.
It's nice that you say "no freezing of accounts" but there's no guarantee of that other than your word. Rebit has the potential to freeze and block payments in the same way PayPal does.
I'm impressed with the service from an outside perspective, but it's not suitable for me at the moment.

Do you mean the wallet history *on the exchange*? Or did you withdraw it from the exchange to a different wallet? Exchanges don't typically have separate wallets for all their individual customers - they have one big wallet which takes deposits and sends withdrawals to seemingly unconnected people - e.g. you deposit 1 bitcoin, and then Bob withdraws 1 bitcoin, it seems your money is being sent to Bob... but you needn't be following the blockchain, when exchanges use their own internal databases to keep track of stuff inside the exchange.

It is not the same at all. Consider the martingale system for example. With an unlimited bankroll, you can never lose.

You're assuming that everyone stops after one bet.

Yes it *is* exactly the same if each of them bets only $100 at a time. But this is very different from someone who can bet a lot more at once.

Well not quite... Yes, phones need to be charged regularly, but that doesn't mean they need to be charged at your own home. Millions of Africans have phones - does every one of these phone owners have electricity in their homes?


If that actually becomes the case (globally), then I'd say bitcoin has very much succeeded. There are plenty of good reasons to be proud of being 'criminal' (e.g. by breaking unjust laws).
Some of that criminality might simply be 'using bitcoin', if governments decide to make it illegal.

Yes, it's totally possible. They could print up very elaborate and forge-resistant polymer bills, each backed by a promise of bitcoins by the issuer.

Some places like blockchain.info offer people to publish a public note along with their transaction, so within the scope of that site it'd be public...

Cars have advantages over riding horses everywhere - but people don't post horse-related news stories on car subreddits - because that would be retarded, and completely off-topic, just like Paypal is offtopic here, despite bitcoin having 'an advantage' over it. If you're going to make that argument, we could post stories about shells and rocks too, right?

Unless you buy in one hit, offline, like through some face-to-face interaction from localbitcoins.com.
That isn't going to affect the price immediately - you'd have plenty of time to get them onto an exchange and sell before your purchase affected online markets.


I disagree here too - if someone needed to sell $200,000 worth urgently, it would be perfectly reasonable to sell them for $180,000 to one buyer, rather than wait days or weeks (possibly dragging the price down) doing it on an exchange.

I finally got around to sending some bitcoins to the *future* for later...
- have a long passphrase that's already secure enough to keep bitcoins safe
- without looking at the strings, generate a random string with random.org that has about a trillion or so possible combinations (don't make it too long)
- still without seeing the string, email it to yourself via futureme.org to a date of your choosing (e.g. 5 or 10 years away)
- still without seeing the random string add it to your passphrase in the brainwallet tab of bitaddress.org
- write down the address, but don't save the private key.
- send some bitcoins to that address.
If you've done this carefully, you'll be able to get those bitcoins in 5 or 10 years by using your strong passphrase combined with the string you get in an email from futureme.org. As a backup scenario, in case futureme never emails you or you miss the email, choose the random chars in such a way that it only takes a year or two at the most to bruteforce.
Edit: instead of a 'brainwallet', the passphrase could correspond to a truecrypt container or other encryption, etc.

Not if you do the calculation beforehand and work out exactly how many possible combinations there are. With 1 trillion for example, that should only take current hardware a few hours really. Even if you resorted to javascript in a browser, a trillion combos could be tried within 2 years. I'm not suggesting to bruteforce the initial passphrase by the way - that should be so long and complex that it would take trillions of *years*, so keep that very safe somewhere - I'm just suggesting to bruteforce the characters you tack on the end of it (that way, you should still be the only person who can practically access the funds).

That was enough to get the entire thing deleted. And I got a similar response from customer service.
@_date: 2015-02-23 02:46:16
I bet it's at least 9.
@_date: 2015-02-18 03:41:59
Then why does mine have an ad for fat women's underwear instead of bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-02-23 04:28:08
In that case... "how meta".

Kind of a similar boat - more like 95%. My only income is crypto. I just convert some to dollars 'on-the-fly' whenever I need to pay for something with dollars.

Yeah, I agree and understand that there would be ways to 'cheat' and get the info earlier. All of these would require extra effort and/or extra capital, though. I'm just thinking of a home user with regular PC that isn't going to run out and buy more gpus or an asic farm.  i.e. me

Yeah it's surreal to think both my kids were invented* after bitcoin.

My point was that sites don't need to have a list of everything that's forbidden; some things are just common sense. Do websites say that hacking their website is forbidden? Do all mysql servers have something in their terms and conditions saying that performing injection attacks are forbidden?

I never balked at 'firing into a crowd' though as you put it. I balked at the fact that you hadn't read (or comprehended my comment).


This is exactly what you did, when you equated my comment about driving *safely* with firing *recklessly*.
I'll debate further if you post a clear and concise question in if you want... This is obviously way off-topic here.
@_date: 2015-10-11 02:51:50
@_date: 2015-02-25 23:28:48
The problem is, I'm not sure what you're attempting to argue about... just ask me a **clear** question if you want, I don't care what 'turf' it's on. That is, if you're able to do that without resorting to personal insults.
@_date: 2016-07-26 06:57:15
Ah, well thanks for working through that with me and submitting it there.
@_date: 2015-02-25 21:34:39


It is if you're unlicensed. i.e. You have to ask permission first before you're allowed to crash your own car. Even if no one gets hurt.

So punish people for crashing, not for driving. Driving safely without a license *is* a victimless crime.

Yes. Unpopular opinions are unpopular.
Bottom line, I'm saying that it should be perfectly legal to send any combination of 1's and 0's in an email, regardless of how the recipient decides to interpret them.
My support of freedom-of-speech is the 100% kind, not the b.s. scaled back version where people get to exclude hate speech, *digital* threats, etc. and everything else they don't like.
Anyway, regardless of whether you think this should be illegal or not, still doesn't make sending 1's and 0's 'violent'.
@_date: 2016-07-08 12:42:22


PHP as a top layer was fine for simply communicating with a bitcoind binary though. Even forgetting Bitcoin entirely though, I am very keen to learn node.js inside and out.
@_date: 2015-02-02 22:08:12
You must be talking about the bitpay logo.
@_date: 2016-07-25 23:01:48


Well, I'm not even sure yet that it's exclusive to bitaddress... it might be in other bitcoinjs sites too. The problem occurs in here somewhere:
    var bytes = Crypto.SHA256(key, { asBytes: true });
    var btcKey = new Bitcoin.ECKey(bytes);
@_date: 2015-02-04 22:04:57
No, I don't think so. In that scenario, you're the *human* that's in control of the gun.
In the case where someone hires an assassin, the assassin is using his *own free will* to act violently.
The *hiring* part still isn't violent, even if you say it should be illegal.

Hundreds of transactions paying 10 cents would have the same outcome. So would tens of transactions paying a dollar.

Yes, you must get a permission slip from someone who also doesn't own the property, before you steal things.

Or don't fix what aint actually broke.
@_date: 2015-11-30 00:08:31


I am surprised by this statement, and disagree. I think you meant to say 'pro-regulation' people. The original pro-bitcoiners are way more anarchistic.
@_date: 2015-02-16 04:34:35


But then you have the added step of converting your USD to bitcoins.

That's complete nonsense. The coinbase team voluntarily chose to incorporate and do business in the US. That makes them complicit.

Okay - never heard of her.

If you're still relying on such an outdated concept, you should probably think about not doing that.

Where did you read this? I didn't see it mentioned in the linked article - perhaps it was edited after you read it.
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:08:22
I managed to get this working by using 7zip to extract the exe they've published, and then finding the folder that has the armory-qt.exe in it, renaming that folder to 'armory' and putting that folder wherever I please. Not quite portable app though, it's still using the registry, etc.

How can I get past [this error](
**edit** nm, I had paytxfee=0.00 in my bitcoin.conf.
Still wondering though, if previous versions allowed this, why is 0.10.0 being a jerk?

Oh, I realised it's actually happening in the very next line:
    var bitcoinAddress = btcKey.getBitcoinAddress();
I'll go into that function when I get a chance and see if I can narrow it down further.

It's a little hard to believe since people like Pirate existed in the early days, and Tom Williams (a.ka. Mr "mybitcoin.com") well before that. And there were probably other hated people even before Tom's exit strategy was a glint in his eye.

Okay, it's failing inside **getBitcoinAddress**
    ECKey.prototype.getBitcoinAddress = function () {
        console.log('now we are in the getBitcoinAddress function');
        var hash = this.getPubKeyHash();
        console.log('getBitcoinAddress: ' + hash);
        var addr = new Bitcoin.Address(hash);
        console.log('getBitcoinAddress: ' + addr);
        return addr.toString();
    };
...even more specifically, it's failing inside:
    var hash = this.getPubKeyHash();
@_date: 2016-07-27 03:37:59


Yeah, probably.


I also did find a couple of others, while doing about 300k iterations, but didn't think to take particular note of them.
Anyway, your loop patch has been working great for me.

Agreed, therefore I downvote your sarcasm. Specifically, fuck companies that follow immoral laws.
@_date: 2016-07-17 13:04:19
Absolutely. It's pretty bullshit to voluntarily get into bed with government regulators and then say "oh but it's not our fault, it's the government regulators".

Wow, 'twas 30 last time I checked... thanks. It sucks a bit because even though I need a lot of disk space, I don't need a 'high volume plan' with tons of RAM and bandwidth. I just need a cheapo plan with some extra space tacked on.


Is this 100% self-hosted or does it need to communicate with bitpay?


Aren't there any boostrapping torrents around that I can upload instead?
Thanks very much for the info.
Edit: On a sidenote - I wish I was as familiar with node.js as I am with PHP. bitcore looks great; it's only my lack of experience with node that makes me hesitate.
@_date: 2016-05-16 23:25:23
Well which one are you talking about? They're completely different entities.
@_date: 2016-07-10 23:50:50


I'll let this word answer that question:
@_date: 2016-07-26 01:35:46
I'll try - upon typing 'internet explorer' into my start menu, I found the only one I have handy is IE8 - and bitaddress doesn't seem to work *at all* in that.
@_date: 2015-02-23 02:33:47
Thanks, it could actually be used as supplement... e.g. you could follow the steps outlined above, but somehow (without looking), email those random chars to yourself.
Then at least if the bruteforcing feels like it's taking too long (it would by nature not have very precise timing), at least then you could look out for an email on a specific date to help access the money.
If futureme.org disappears, you'd still have the option of continuing to brute force...
@_date: 2015-02-11 21:44:55


Tell that to Ross.

'Bitcoin' is also totally an arbitrary cryptocurrency. Plenty of others let you opt out of the banking system.
