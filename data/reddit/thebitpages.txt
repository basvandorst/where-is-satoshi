I think this is primarily for economists' who think of private as in "private sector" or "private property" and not "permissioned."
@_date: 2019-08-19 14:04:45
This is semantics -- Bitcoin is not a public network if your definition of public is "state-owned." Now, the authors concede that not all definitions of public are "state-owned" it can also mean permissionless -- the point is that they were clear who their audience was and it was not computer scientists.

That would confuse economists in the same way it would confuse lawyers to call bitcoins "public property" if you were challenging a seizure or a taking. The Fifth Amendment says, "nor shall private property be taken for public use, without just compensation."
The fact that the authors went out of their way to be specific that they were using a term that means one thing in the computer science context and another in the economics context should be enough.

Are you opposed to calling it private property for the same reasons?

not absolutely sure, but maybe a way for each of our users to automatically have a bitmessage address created for them?

Our site has a users section where people can message each other -- does anyone know of ways that we can integrate bitmessage into what we are doing?
