What is "Source-Available"? Does that mean the source code is only available upon request or for a fee?

Where you mention the term"private key", replace that with the term "secret", as "private key" is a term used with respect to PKI. Secret is more appropriate in this instance as it avoids terminology collision and carries no extra ambiguous implications.

Best explanation is that they were being sloppy with their wording.

There are 3 time locks to be aware of:
* CLTV - CheckTimeLockVerify
* CSV - CheckSequenceVerify
* HTLC - HashedTimeLockContract
CLTV is an absolute time lock, meaning that the funds from that UTXO can't be spent till block  This is effectively a date, because we know the average time it takes for a block to be mined.
Similarly, CSV is a relative time lock, meaning that the funds from that UTXO can't be spent till N blocks after the transaction is included in the block chain. Again, since we know the average time to mine a block, we can calculate an effective date by which that UTXO can be spent.
HTLC's are just one of the previous time locks with a requisite hash associated with it, where in order to be spent, both the time condition must be met along with the spender providing a secret that, when hashed, produces the same hash in the HTLC. This prevents the broadcasting of old transactions from a Lightning Network Channel.

The way this infographic describes channel funding doesn't quite seem correct.
Technically the channel to be funded will be closed, but in that same on-chain transaction, you can open a new channel.
Both explanations require an on-chain transaction, but the graphic's explanation might be incorrect.
What should be additionally noted though is that there is a way to avoid completely the opening and closing of channels using something called ["Channel Factories"](
EDIT: If I'm mistaken, can you please point me to the technical explanation concerning how the graphics' variation would work outside of establishing a new channel with another party in the network and making a transaction to yourself on the LN that is routed some other way that doesn't include the new channel?

It's probably higher. Just read a post from someone saying they're making segwit transactions at 10sat/b

Coinbase service fees are different than Bitcoin fees. They charge as much as they do to make a profit off the service they offer. You can sidestep this slightly by purchasing bitcoin directly from GDAX -- which is their exchange --
 for much lower fees, but make sure you understand how exchange buy and sell orders work first.

Technically there is no transit. You create a transaction to your Trezor wallet address and wait for the transaction to be processed (confirmed) by the network. All value is stored on the distributed ledger.
That being said, you lose a small amount just in the form of transaction fees, which you pay to the miners to have your transaction processed.
@_date: 2017-05-25 20:16:27
1) Fee varies based on how many transactions miners have filling up their mempools. Not related to the amount of the transaction though.
2) Same situation. All "on-chain" transactions incur a fee and require time to be processed (10 minutes on average?)
3) Not sure. I need to research this point more.
4) If you want to invest long term and not touch it, then create a cold storage wallet. On this point, all a wallet is, is a pair of private/public keys that let you make transactions with the value stored on the block chain. None of the value of bitcoin is stored in a single location, but rather on the distributed ledger known as the block chain, so you don't even need a PC for cold storage; you just need some way to store the private key. You can even print the private key out as a QR code in case you don't trust digital store media, as they can degrade over time for various reasons. You can even create a wallet that uses a word seed to generate a tree of wallets and then just store this word phrase in a notebook somewhere (Or something. I still need to read up on this).
5) Bitcoin Core is reliable I assume since it's developed by the Bitcoin Core developers.

I think it has more to do with people knowing what cars and electricity are compared to knowing what hashing and blockchains are. The former are more tangible to everyone's daily lives. The latter, while important, mostly just moves money around online, which from the everyday consumer point of, nothing much changes.
The revolution of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies feels hidden due to the supposed complexity of putting forth the effort to adopt it on its own rather than through a service like BitPay. And even when someone puts forth the effort to adopt a cryptocurrency, they have to find others who have done the same. In most countries, it's a "neat thing" to use, but no more convenient than the already established payment methods.
And really, at the end of the day, it's a technology which will mostly gain it's foothold behind the scenes, unless something unexpected happens, like another global financial collapse.

Do you have an explanatory reference to these secret exploits, ASICBOOST, etc.? I'm just now learning about everything and would like to know more.
Also, what is MM? I keep seeing that, but not sure what unit it refers to.

It depends on where you go to exchange whatever currency you're starting out with into bitcoin.
For instance, Coinbase charges a 4% fee if you buy bitcoin with a credit or debit. If you buy it using your bank account it's only 1.49%. If you have the wrong bank it seems, they charge you regressively higher fee percentages, so like with my bank, they charge me $0.99 when trying to buy $5 of cryptocurrency, but only $2.00 if I were to buy $50 worth of cryptocurrency (BTC, ETH, LTC).
On top of that, if you buy cryptocurrency directly, your bank charges an international transaction fee, because it views the cryptocurrency the same way as normal foreign currencies.
You can probably get around the bank's fee if you first transfer the funds to the service, such as Coinbase, BitBay or wherever, and then exchange the normal currency with the cryptocurrency on their system. The problem with this is that it takes forever for the transfer to go through in my experience, probably due to fraud and abuse issues these services have to deal with when it comes to transacting with normal currency.
Once everything is in the land of bitcoin or whatever other cryptocurrency, there is a fee for every transaction in order to get your transaction processed by the bitcoin miners who "bake" the transaction into the blockchain.
TL;DR - Yes, if it's 48.82, then have a few bucks extra just for whatever.

What denominations were you requesting? Depending on how much money you have, they may require time to get the requisite cash on hand as they might only have a limited amount in their vault and are required to have so much to service all their customers and not just a single weirdo requesting 10k+ in cash.

You could wire up a Raspberry Pi to an LED digit display and maybe some piezos buzzers, then write a simple node.js server script to send price queries to an exchange using their API, while making calculations on the price stream using indicators such as MACD.
Could also install postfix and have it send you emails when certain market parameters meet your desired heuristics for buy, sell, etc. when you're away from your Pi.
Additionally, you could have a simple node.js server set up that listens for authenticated requests from a simple web front end, letting you give it specific buy, sell, etc. orders, which it then relays to the exchange.

"Most people" ignore the stock market, because it doesn't seem relevant to their everyday lives. These are the people most affected and also the ones least likely to expect it, unless they're the kind that are constantly saying it will crash any day now, but who are just as ignorant as everyone else.
To those following the market though, yeah, I think maybe something is brewing that will happen in a couple years based on the indicators we know, and maybe earlier if there are indicators we don't know. I read an article recently extolling the new heights of the housing market which "hasn't been this high since 2007" said in full apparent ignorance of the irony of that statement. Stock in home improvement and building supplies are up there to those previous levels, though I'm not sure if the figures were adjusted for inflation, which means we still have some time before that bubble bursts again. On top of that, housing is still somehow more affordable, and banks are pitching subprime loans again, which I've witnessed first hand when the bank teller was confused after they called corporate to get the exact credit score needed and found that corporate lowered the requisite credit score for a second mortgage (overhead this whole convo at the bank).

CEO of Bitmain, a big Bitcoin miner in China. He's partly responsible for the delay behind Segwit adoption as he's been taking advantage of something called ASICBOOST, which is a kind of hashing speedup that takes advantage of peculiarities of the protocol, which would go away if Segwit is adopted. It was secret until recently when someone leaked it to the public.
This may contain inaccuracies, but this is what I think I remember about what I've read.

A Bitcoin can be divided into 100,000,000 Satoshis, so functionally, nothing much changes if coins are lost, other than the price going up, assuming demand is constant.

Over what time period?
To transfer bitcoin between exchanges requires an on-chain transaction. Purchases on exchanges are mostly off-chain, which is why you can buy and then immediately turn around and sell.
@_date: 2017-06-30 10:21:36
Depends on the altcoin in question. Most exchanges only have USD pairs with certain coins, such as BTC, LTC, and ETH (and others?), so if your altcoin in question isn't one of those, then you have to add a step where you trade your altcoin for one of the coins that have a USD pair, and then trade to USD.
EDIT: That or find someone outside of an exchange willing to make a trade directly to USD.
