Do you use teamviewer or any other remote login software?
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:55:12
And this of course relevant to bitcoin because...?
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:07:49
There is absolutely no evidence that Bitcoin went even up 1 dollar because of Cyprus. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 11:58:35
I wonder if they know your history and what a total delusional bat shit crazy nutter you are. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 09:31:12
How the hell is anybody here to supposed to know? 
This is asked every single day here. 
We still, believe it or not, can not look into the future. 
I wonder why so many people every day think we can. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:19:14
Wow! Awesome news!
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:55:43
Obviously. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:24:30
Wow, your shouting makes your thread look reaaally important. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 21:23:18
Your first day on the internet?
@_date: 2014-12-16 12:41:21
Yeah, bitcoin is doing extremely bad this year because of christmas. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:52:22
Hilarious how every time we go down dozens of these posts pop up. 
Suddenly it's all about the fundamentals and the price isn't important anymore. 
But once we go up 10 bucks this sub is completely filled with moon posts. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:52:53
But any bullshit story that pumps Bitcoin from a new user, with his first post and no proof and everyone here upvotes it like there is no tomorrow. 
Bad news - we are a very critical crowd and don't like bullshit. 
Good news - fuck proof! Let the circle jerk start!
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:07:59
You can keep your tip. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 10:51:02
You know things are bad when these kind of posts appear. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:46:35
What are you talking about? I just have no need for other people's money. That's all. 
Yeah, just keep downvoting me because i didn't accept his money. Idiots. 
What a sad fucking life one must have if you spend your day downvoting people on Reddit just because you don't agree with them. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:29:57
Nothing. Just like any other problem we downvote, ignore or ridicule it. 
And then we cry why user adoption just isn't happening and blame the banks and non existant paid shills. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 00:00:33
I'm educating. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:48:11
He doesn't. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:36:29
No they don't.  
But of course just like Cyprus in 2013 just make up some facts, repeat it long enough and the majority will believe it. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 03:47:13
People lost interest. Early adopters cashing out. Bitfinex trading driving the price down. Companies dumping their coins people paid with. And so on. 
Is there anything here you can post without getting downvoted?
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:19:41
Well, all the smart people already long ago cashed out and are enjoying their new cars and houses. What's left are a bunch of broke people who spent their last money on the coins the first group dumped. After that it went downhill fast. 
Everyone here is slowly starting to realize what you just said. There is no more getting rich with a 300 dollar investment. Instead everyone sees their coins getting worth less by the day. 
Now all that is left is a group of nerds/kids/anarchists/druggies/dreamers who come here daily to circle jerk over the most stupid shit and pretend everything is going well. Even that will stop soon. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:00:36
I remember everyone saying that about 2014. 
You people never learn, do you?
I'm not saying it won't happen but maybe you should be more careful with your predictions. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 23:45:59
Sure, just a few people are worried and the majority is buying all these coins. 
What's the weather like in fantasy land?
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:05:19
Wow. Original thread. Thanks for pointing this out. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 00:54:49
No he hasn't. Instead he prefers to ask the same questions that have been answered a million times by now. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:26:18
People have been warned many times about them already but they don't care. They're greedy idiots. 
It's only when they run into problems that they come here to cry how that company is a scam. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:29:28
No idea but if i can fit your moms massive beaver in there i'm sure 3 cocks will be no problem. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 20:37:24
Nothing...but downvoted anyway. This place is just great. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 18:44:57
Wasn't this like 6 months ago?
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:58:48
OP, can you point out some of these shills and explain to me what or who they are shilling for?
@_date: 2014-12-16 12:01:34
6 years have passed and it's doing worse by the day. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:24:20
Probably because of all the people cashing out. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 09:59:41
So who exactly are these Bitcoin experts?
Ah of course downvoted. One is not allowed to ask such questions here. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:31:54
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:08:31
Shills? What kind of shills?
Edit: yeah just downvote the fuck out of that question and don't answer it. This place can be so fucking pathetic at times. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:42:32
What is there to explain? No. As in no that isn't happening. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:27:21
No. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:51:40
When you think about it, this total down trend could be caused by one person slowly dumping all those coins on several exchanges. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 10:04:02
Grow up. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:59:23
Most people, yes. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:23:03
Give it up man. We all know that 99% of the people here are in it for the money. Let's just admit it. It will make it all less cringey. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 10:04:28
Oh right. Circle jerk on then. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:58:53
Why the hell is this the 2nd post on the mainpage?
We all know it's complete bs but upvote it anyway? What's wrong with this place?
@_date: 2014-12-15 01:35:58
So you mentioned banks to somehow make this Bitcoin relevant?
@_date: 2014-12-18 11:59:40
There was no Cyprus thing. Or at least not Bitcoin related. I wish people would stop repeating that nonsense. 
And you are seriously surprised that the Russians aren't moving to a currency that lost 70% of its value this year?
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:15:36
The credit card bs excuse. 
In every single thread about this. 
Basically you are saying: bitcoin has an amazing fool proof security system but you shouldn't use it because when people pay with credit cards they can charge back up to 6 months. 
See how much sense that makes?
@_date: 2014-12-18 22:39:22
Did you read at all what i'm typing?
@_date: 2014-12-16 09:53:24
Even new people could realize we can't look into the future. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 14:45:57
No they aren't. Stop this nonsense. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:22:50
The more the price goes down the more ridiculous the new threads here. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:25:50
Stop acting like you can predict the future. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:12:49
Very good article. Especially the first part. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:02:07
The dollar is getting stronger while Bitcoin is collapsing. 
Not exactly what the cultists here had in mind. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 01:26:19
So no you can't point them out or explain who or what they are shilling for. 
I know enough. 
You idiots can continue with the downvotes now. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:48:46
How are we supposed to know? Call your isp and get a new ip. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:05:03
Banker shill?? Wtf?
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:02:41
Pulling numbers out your ass and then even guarantee it. The fact that this garbage is upvoted says a lot about this sub. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:44:55
The internet money of the future is not safe on your computer. Sounds great. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:10:05
Stop it man. We got it. Fiat bad, Bitcoin good. No need to post about the Ruble every 15 minutes. 
May i also remind you that Bitcoin lost like 70% of its value this year. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 00:20:50
Don't worry. Someone will come up with a reason why this is actually good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:39:10
Couldn't you post this in one of the existing 50 threads?
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:49:54
This is good news for Bitcoin. It's not  anymore. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 08:01:20
Or you just get an anti keylogger. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:36:01
Look, i don't like Ripple but no matter if we like it or not it's going up like crazy at the moment because people are throwing a lot of money at it. 
You can downvote this fact all you want, it won't make it any less true. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:05:09
I get about 200 phishing mails a day. For the last 10 years. I stopped posting about it about 10 years ago. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:05:43
Reality hurts i see. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:42:00
I don't understand this meme of a bearwhale being killed. 
The guy put up a shitload of coins for sale and people paid him the price he asked for them. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 22:05:23
I now realize why you people always come up with the 6 month thing. 
The thread usually starts out about how customers are gonna have to wait in the store for 1 or more confirmations, making the the system useless and then you switch it around and start talking about the store owner. I now realize this happens every single time in these kind of threads. You avoid the original subject and make it about something else so it looks like it actually works. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:18:42
Because banks like to make money. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:31:21
Edit: actually this post has to be some kind of troll. Asking investment advice for 20 bucks? Troll. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 01:03:42
Why don't you transfer the domain to Namecheap and then pay with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-17 20:41:13
Quick, go throw some cents at him and spam the hell out of that thread. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:00:18
Every single day at least 1 person asks this. Every. Single. Day.
And EVERY SINGLE DAY the answer stays the same. Nobody here knows what Bitcoin will do. Nobody can look into the future. 
That so many people think otherwise truly scares me. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 23:35:53
Because pretty much everyone who bought this year is losing money. And fast. 
Pretending like nothing is wrong is just silly. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 12:39:23
Please stop. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:33:38
Cringe fest everytime someone posts those quotes. 
Especially since it's been posted weekly since we went down from $1200. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:43:36
Nobody in his right mind after losing his money is gonna put it in the other worst performing currency this year. Get real. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 09:52:25
They said the same thing here when coins were at 800. You have no idea if they're cheap or not and shouldn't be suggesting so to new people. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:50:38
Yes and complete bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:14:43
You've got it all figured out!
I never seen so many amazing financial analysts as in this sub. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 16:00:58
Go look up what censorship means. Until then stop making a fool of yourself. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:01:46
The Ruble would also be worth more if it becomes worth more. 
Yes, that's your logic. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 23:14:15
Use the search man. This has been done 100's of times already. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 23:17:11
Better money than a currency that lost 70% of its value in a year. No, i can't think of any. 
Also what will happen in a couple of years? Anything i should know? Got some insider info about the future?
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:48:55
After 5 threads screaming "Ruble is going to shit this is amazing news for Bitcoin fap fap fap" we got it. Take a guess what i'd suggest the mods to do with the 10 same posts after that. 
Let me know if you're able to figure it out by yourself. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 09:14:22
How the hell is he supposed to know?
@_date: 2014-12-16 12:19:52
Can the mods please start doing something about these Ruble posts? It's getting ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 19:04:11
There is already a circle jerk going about that news item. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:54:01
Another worthless meme. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:05:14
It isn't booming. What the hell are you talking about?
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:50:24
Please. Please just stop. It's been enough. We've had 20+ threads about the Ruble now. Stop it. 
Bitcoin is doing just as bad. So this really isn't the place to circle jerk over it. 
Also Bitcoin is going down every day. How you can suggest these people should move to Bitcoin is beyond me. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 09:24:41
No. They're not gonna put money in something that performs even worse. Get out of fantasy land. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:52:46
No they aren't. Stop pulling "facts" out of your ass. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:40:34
This has absolutely nothing to do with censorship. I'm not trying to get anything censored. Don't be silly. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:16:52
Downvoted for stating facts. This place is a riot. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 22:43:05
No. 
300 threads would've told you that. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:40:33
Please just stop. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 12:04:00
Not gonna happen. It's party time here when a country goes bankrupt and millions are suffering. Eventhough never ever has a crisis in a country made people turn to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:24:22
Probably because everyone here told him that those $900 coins were cheap and would be worth 10k soon. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 01:08:59
Thank god Bitcoiners instead are known for their unbiased, rational views without caring for money. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:59:16
A new crisis doesn't mean bitcoin will go up. It's scary the majority of the people here think this is a guarantee. 
So far there has not been a single negative financial event that made people turn to Bitcoin. There might never be. The sooner you accept this the better.  
To those downvoting me, feel free to explain why. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:03:19
Try the finances sub for instance. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 12:01:00
Lets stop with the myth that some kind of secret big whale is trying to buy all the cheap coins by keeping the price down. It's ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 13:15:53
No. Just tired of the circle jerk about the Ruble collapsing. Especially since Bitcoin is doing even worse. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 21:55:23
It's old news he posted again so we can circle jerk over it again. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 22:15:49
Exactly. So right now it simply isn't good enough for mainstream adoption. 
You'd say this is a massive problem that gets talked about a lot so we can look for solutions. But that doesn't happen. 
If you mention this you get downvoted and ridiculed. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 21:19:22
No. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 05:05:31
Relax. Bitcoin is doing great. Everything is fine. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 00:09:05
Sure. That's why they call me the specialist. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 09:50:29
No it didn't trigger a Bitcoin rally. Neither will this. 
It would be great if we could stop circle jerking about the Ruble failing every 10 minutes in a new thread and discuss Bitcoin, which has gone down 70% in a year, instead. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 11:59:53
Why bother asking this? Every answer will be somewhere between yes no or maybe. Waste of bandwidth. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 18:55:49
Take a look at the sub you're in and then take a guess. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:27:57
God, you're retarded. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 18:27:52
You are right but the people doing this simply refuse to understand this. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:10:14
Because no sane person is gonna put his money in a currency that has gone down 70% in a year after just losing a lot money. 
You really couldn't figure that out yourself? 
@_date: 2014-12-18 15:05:37
It's this simple. An electronics store is gonna want 1 confirmation when you buy a 1500 dollar tv. Which means you're gonna have to wait up to 1 hour before you can walk out of the store. So obviously the way Bitcoin works now won't be good enough and needs to change in the future. 
They hate this subject here and will come up with tons of irrelevant excuses. Of which none will make this less of a problem. It's a forbidden subject. 
And here come the downvotes. The typical bitcoiner behavior. Just downvote any problem there might be till it goes away. 
We don't talk about problems here. We pretend they don't exist. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 23:43:31
And another amazing analyst who has it all figured out. This place is truly special.  
@_date: 2014-12-17 19:08:40
This thread will be downvoted and you will be ridiculed. 
And that says enough. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 11:40:54
I don't feel sorry for you or anyone else who uses that site that is made for scammers. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 17:08:46
Amazing, you found the real reason Bitcoin is going down. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 22:54:08
That would most likely be the worst thing that could happen to Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 09:56:16
Why the hell would i be butt hurt? 
The circle jerk is just getting ridiculous. Everyone here is celebrating that the Ruble has gone to shit as if that's somehow good for Bitcoin and at the same time ignoring that Bitcoin performed even worse this year. Making it even more ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:17:16
Ok you solved it. Now please stop making new threads about Russia. This is getting insane. 
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:28:57
Step away from the computer. 
@_date: 2014-12-19 00:40:14
I have no clue what you are talking about but all i know if Bitcoin needs any of that stuff to survive then it already failed. 
@_date: 2014-12-17 16:03:48
The things i read here. 
Sometimes it feels like all the crazies of the internet have found their way to this sub. 
@_date: 2014-12-18 16:16:13
So one of Bitcoins most advertised features, the confirmation security, simply is useless in normaly daily life usage. 
Ok, we agree then. Good. 
I still don't understand why there is always someone bringing up the 6 month cc thing.
