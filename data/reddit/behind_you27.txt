One guy at our office asked me: "Hey are you still invested in Bitcoin? I heard it rose from 3500 to 5k this Spring, right?"  
I was like yes, I bought a bit when it was around 3.7k...  
He: You should sell soon. This price will drop back down again. 
I: Well, I will see. I guess I don't care but maybe I'll sell.   
He: I will show you, some guy made this Trading Analysis
I: Ok, show me.   
He pulls out his phone, shows me a chart with like 10 indicators and 20 lines.
I: Okay looks difficult
He: Very easy: "Bla bla bla" and thats why it will drop down again. 
I: Thanks for your help. Good thing I won't lose money now.
Plottwist: I didn't sell a thing. I should have bought. Moral of the story: Don't rely on other people when investing your own money.

Now it's not about how many things you have. It's about how many BTC you have.

The worst time to upgrade your tech is right now. So many good things will come out in the future. I decided that I only upgrade until it's really broken. Unrepairable. (Already changed screen, Battery and so on)  
Still works. In addition I don't want to spend so much time on the phone (less than 1h a day), thats why I only have a selected few apps on there.

Joke is on you. Should buy on the way down and sell on the way up. 
(Buy most at low, sell most at high -&gt; easy profit)

The company will be like: Yes, we recovered your keys but...well...a few hours before someone emptied your wallet.

I think we might get a bond-market crash in the next 10-20 years....While the politicians are so eager to protect the stock market, they lose the connection to the people they work for. They print billions of dollars to keep the ship afloat but hurt the average tax-payer. The people are losing trust in the fiat currencys as a general save habor for their earnings. Ina few years if this printing won't stop, people will rather save their money in legit crypto currencys because only there you have the trust that there can't be anyone changeing it. Crypto is giving the power of the finances back to the people - one of the most powerful tools that Goverments have. They have shown that they can't handle that power. 
In a stock-market the only thing that might get lost is a few billions, Jobs and companies...In a bond market crash we are facing complete lack of trust in the fiat-currency. 
The only way out is a currency that is completely decentralized and not controlled by anyone or controlled by everyone.
Libra is an alternative to the Fiat system. You could argue that it could be better than the Fiat-System. However there is just one true decentralized currency that you should hold. 
I have the vision that in the future, Goverments have their currency to play with but the people will keep their wealth in secure currencys that aren't played with. Bitcoin is already changeing the way we think about money. For me it's not anymore about "How much money did you make with BTC", it turned into: "How much should I put in Bitcoin in order to protect myself for a financial collapse?"  
The thing is: I know that BTC will plummet like everything once the collapse is here. But I ecpect it to rise more and faster once the trust in the Fiat-system has been lost indefinitly. Venezuela is just the start.

Well, when Invest new cash into BTC I want to get my invest 50% back. So I sell a bit when I made some profits. (At least 100%)
I reinvest this when it’s cheaper again. This is just for me to lower my risk-levels.

This is actually illegal in some countries/states. Not sure if Murica or Europe.
@_date: 2019-07-19 09:19:00
The goal for me. Work till 30 then have a high enough passive income to not HAVE to work. I'd still work but then I sucessfully broke out of the rat race. 
My motto: Be free with thirty (I'm 23 right now)

But when this happens, the average Joe won't buy it. Or he will try to buy it even more.

I almost was scared as I got the info on my phone that this is trending. Just sent new money to dca again into btc. Usually it pumps just before or dumps right after I start DCA ing. 
@_date: 2018-09-03 09:44:20
I assume most of Europe has that kind of law. In Germany it's even free after one year. 
@_date: 2019-07-03 09:25:02
Damn, by the way it was written, especially the last article, I was certain that it was fake.
@_date: 2018-09-19 11:47:45
What a fake title.

That’s some quality nerd stuff.

That's the thing....If you have the money a Porsche (depends a bit) might be apprechiating in value.  
At least if you go for a 911 (specific models, not the standard stuff).  
Fun Fact: If you would have bought a Gt4 Cayman (90k), you would have made money while driving it. Used cars sell for \~120k right now.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:22:40
Go for class-Porsche

Yes, true. Sorry, missed that.
In my opinion BTC should try to become a stable liquid currency. So neither inflationary nor deflationary.
Should be possible quite easily. Just let the machine make some calculations regarding activity of the wallets. If the wallet hasn't sent anything for X years (maybe 10) , these coins will be added to the mining pool.In case wallets send coins after they are deemed lost, these are counted negatively towards the circulating supply -&gt; They won't lose them if they just don't use them.That will lead to a quite stable amout of liquid tokens (BTC), of cause, you might get above 21 Million in liquidity for short amounts of time but you also don't punish people for spending Bitcoin as a currency so much.
Example: No tokens have been sent from the Satoshi wallet for 10 years. They are added to the "mineable tokens" and are released slowly. Suddenly someone sends a token from the Satoshi-wallet. The release of these tokens stops and until there are again less than 21 million tokens accessed over period x (ten years), the machine will not issue new BTC via mining.

Well, but he’s driving an electric car and wants to preserve the endless resources on this world so Idc if he doesn’t believe in climate change if he doesn’t produce carbon or other greenhouse gases. 
But this is one point I strongly disagree with him. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:01:01
More like 3 Million. Satoshis stash is also (probably/hopefully) lost.
@_date: 2019-06-17 14:00:09
There aren't even 21 Million BTC in circulation anymore. A few thousand got lost anyway. I've read some calculations that said there won't be more than 19 Million ever in circulation because so many Bitcoins got lost (and Satoshi's aren't in circulation).
@_date: 2019-06-18 14:06:00
Wowowo hold up. 
When I say they aren't in circulation it doesn't mean they don't exist. There isn't anyone that has access to these bitcoin. They aren't accessable.
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:59:03
Well, I bought at 3.5k.... I thought that's a good price.   
I didn't know how good a price this was... Holy macaroni
Should have bought more.
@_date: 2019-12-09 21:22:44
Well they have negative rates because the money from the EZB is basically for free, more like it costs them to deposit it.
 So they need to make money somehow.
@_date: 2019-04-12 07:20:46
Because you would have to tax it when crossing the border.
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:56:37
In theory you could. Germany wouldn't care. However your country where you are coming from will care. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 08:26:09
Nope. It's not true. It's one year of holding, then it's tax-free.   
This does not apply to stocks or anything else. In Germany this is called "privates Veräußerungsgeschäft". So its a private sell from not daily usable eonomical product. Usually art or other precious metals are used  in this area.   
Other than that, taxes in Germany are a minefield. So don't try to come to germany and avoid taxes. Thats not a good idea. Go to switzerland or singapore, they have no taxes on capital gains at all, which makes it a lot easier.

I'm happy there is a new season coming. I'm sad it's the last one.
@_date: 2019-05-22 06:12:14
Okay, two things: 
1. Obligatory: You‘re a retard for not tripple-checking the correct adress.
2. Do you have any idea how complicated it is to fully check through their data in order to be sure that this one BTC was wrongfully sent?
I could expect that it’s not worth to do so. 
I can fully understand that they won’t send 1BTC to a random person that claims it is theirs.
