The community actually does need someone like him.  The reason being, you need constant new blood.  Max and people like him make a lot of noise and are a jumping point for other media outlets to start looking into the markets.  Yes we need new blood.  Bitcoin will only ever be huge if it becomes commonly accepted.  Do while I don't care for him or his methods, he has a loud voice and helps put crypto in the map.

Please answer this one. I HAD been thinking that ATMS would be a first step in etc becoming widespread... ie your grandma knows about it. The biggest problem is getting your hands on then. This solves that problem. The next step is to get places like payday loans or currency converter places to carry btc

A product like a rechargeable or refillable visa card.  By this I mean a simple vehicle which you can use, or give away and  can be filled by any established crypto/currency.  Every currency would exchange to btc.  However, you could pay with any established currency as well.  You could use swipe readers like they sell for smart phones to fill and pay for product.  The process should be simple and could be hooked up to a service like cryptsy for the exchange rates.  To fill your card you would send currency from your wallet to ... the card?..which might have it's own etc address..not sure how the exact process would work in the end.  The point is not to change what we have, but add more versatility without needing to visit an exchange.
