I like bitcoin but it hasn't really come so far that it can even be compared to the GBP. Brexit will have major implications for how the country is run and even for how major parts of the world will continue to run. It has a massive impact for global trade. This event is "just" a heist, and it made the currency drop. If there was a heist on a bank the currency stolen would most likely not drop. 
BTC is still far too volatile to even be considered to be in the same league as the world's major currencies. Which is why speculating in BTC is so much fun :)

Investing into Bitcoin is not investing into the protocol. Any companies looking to adopt the technology would probably just fork it for themselves and develop on the tech.

They do. No sane company would accept the BTC itself when you need price stability to pay suppliers and various bills. People are delusional because of the recent price increase in all crypto (everyone is Warren Buffett based on their certainty in all price claims) but what if a vendor accepted BTC, waited to exchange until specific times and suddenly there was a crash as there have been before? Suddenly you can't pay your bills and have to take a loan because of a "currency" you accepted. It's stupid. Everyone exchanges their BTC instantly.

This sub makes no sense. A world where Bitcoin rules is a world were no taxes are paid and is therefore libertarian. Libertarians are AGAINST net neutrality because net neutrality is government interfering with the free market. Make up your mind.

They really shouldn't have. That's not how a retail bussiness operates. They can't just speculate in whatever hot asset there is. Hindsight is 20/20 so obviously from this perspective they would have profited of it but they can't open a credit line to pay the developers while they "hodl" bitcoin. That's irrational. What if the bubble bursts in a couple of weeks and they lose all their proceeds? Now in this case it probably wouldn't have mattered that much as their bitcoin sales were probably insignificant compared to their real money/fiat gateways but still. You don't risk money in extremely speculative assets, especially when your bussiness isn't oriented in that field. 
On top of this, they probably don't have much of a choice. Bitcoin gateway providers sell BTC instantly to fiat which is why the companies use those providers in the first place. They provide security. I'd be amazed if there were any companies who accepted BTC and exchanged it themselves.

You can read about how it works on their websites. I think BitPay and Coinbase both operate as gateway providers.

Shit like this absolutely doesn't happen and if it did that man is not deserving of being a professor in fucking finance. Plebians fearing that Bitcoin will rule the world is the circlejerking fantasy of the average subscriber (probably under 18 yrs too) here with 0.0001 BTC hoping to make it out rich (in USD, of course) and not something that would happen in the real world.

Investing in Bitcoin is not investing into the blockchain technology. Bitcoin is therefore one of the many of the horses, however fast it may be.

Did none of you learn source criticism in school? This is just the blog platform of Forbes. Same as all other articles that get upvoted to the top, they are almost never the opinions of the newspaper itself, it is always their blogging/self-publishing platform.

Okay, perhaps that's your experience but the fact of the matter is that Coinbase is the major player here, their userbase increased by several millions during the latest rush and they raised $100m in funding recently, this along with their FDIC-insurance of fiat makes them one of the few legitimate companies. And let's be honest. 99.98% of the new users aren't ancap-edgelords who truly believe Bitcoin will overtake the world and send the banks to hell and overturn the tax system. They aren't people who use rooted Google-free Android phones and DuckDuckGo over privacy concerns. They aren't using their Linux computers in faraday cages. They aren't using Protonmail. That's counterintuitive to most people who have obligations and real-life responsibilities since a failure of the banking system and fiat and the entire government is a failure of their day-to-day lives (pensions, insurances, savings, loans, houses, salaries, governmental systems such as police, military, roads, health care, welfare and so on). They are in it for the money as proven by the prevalence of rollercoaster memes and constant price discussion instead of adoption and usage. They are average people and average people don't mind handing over their privacy to companies that give the impression of being serious. I'm not shilling or whatever, just saying the way it is.

You are basically calling for the death of Bitcoin. None of the other sites are noob-friendly. Coinbase is where most people start and it is the newbies that have driven up the prices recently.

Yes. He can now pay an extra $0.37 on his $2 coffee purchase with a ten minute waiting confirmation time while I can instantly pay with my card and get various cashback bonuses. It's *decentralized*, bruh.

Don't be stupid and use localbitcoins. I get that you guys love privacy but you have to have like a 25-50% gain on your investment to break even depending on where you live. Use a proper exchange and get verified to higher tiers.

You are delusional or sheltered if you think the average person can put in $10k in any investment device, much less in what is currently a lottery (i.e. market cap growth is not based on fundamentals). Also based off of the "lambo" and "moon" comments I'd wager tons of the new users are just kids who absolutely don't have $10k.
