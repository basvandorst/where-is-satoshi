I don't see any specific definitions in the text of the bill. 
I just think the petition is not very clear with respect to why bitcoin should be excluded. If it is to say bitcoin or other crypto is not currency then the argument needs formatted to clarify this. 
Currency has these characteristics:
A. ...
B. ...
C. ...
Crypto doesn't fit because...
A. ...
B. ...
C. ...

The argument is that bitcoin isn't a currency. That seems to go against what bitcoin is about. I do think bitcoin is a form of currency.

The paragraph of that letter has no argument to indicate bitcoin is not a currency. 
"As with traditional commodities, like crude oil and gold, the value of Bitcoin is highly volatile and dependent upon supply and demand. Like gold, Bitcoins are a finite resource. 
“[O]nly 21 million bitcoins will ever be created.” Frequently Asked Questions, BITCOIN,  (last visited Aug. 16, 2016). Furthermore, acquiring 
Bitcoin is analogous to acquiring other commodities. A person who wishes to obtain a 
commodity, like gold, for example, can either purchase gold on the market or can mine the gold 
himself. Similarly, a person who wishes to obtain Bitcoins can either purchase them on the 
market or “mine” them himself through participation in Bitcoin’s transaction verification 
process. See Stephen T. Middlebrook &amp; Sarah Jane Hughes, Regulating Cryptocurrencies in the 
United States: Current Issues and Future Directions, 40 WM. MITCHELL L. REV. 813, 818 
(2014). Therefore, Bitcoin, which is nothing but programming code, lacks all the characteristics 
of monetary instruments, financial products, currencies, or money."
The argument here is that bitcoin is obtained like other commodities, therefore it is not like currency. 
I agree with the sentiment of not rushing into regulation. But the arguments here in the petition are not well fleshed out.

I just think the argument needs summarized and clarified. I want to see clarity not obfuscation!
