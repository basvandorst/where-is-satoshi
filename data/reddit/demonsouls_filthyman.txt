If he really said that he's arrogant and dillusional.  As if to say he would like nothing better than to finally meet someone on his level.  Jobs was a fucking douche that got lucky

Banks are laughing at Bitcoin but not blockchain

I fly business class for work, sometimes costing upwards of 12k.  Would never pay for it personally.  I think I would have to make around a million a year to feel ok about it.  Even then, imagine if you have your whole family with you. 
@_date: 2016-10-02 19:02:31
i'm pretty sure its free bc i have never seen anything saying you would have to pay for it.  in fact is seems like they pay you to use it
@_date: 2016-10-23 02:19:51
I have used it exclusively now for about six months. Never had an issue

I've been using this browser for a few months and I like it.  I'm not an IT guy or a bitcoin expert but for me the browser seems to stay out of your way and just lets you do what you want.  I use it on my iphone, my mac, and windows 7 and 10.  When i go to a website in a different browser I dont even recognize it because I am so used to the adblocking by Brave.  Maybe the adblocker add ons are just as good, i dont know.  For me I like it because it doesnt allow advertisers to essentially spy on you which is what they are doing.  puts one tinfoil hat......

I use brave and got this same type of message when visiting wired.com, at least I think it was wired.com
Funny thing is that I just made a payment via brave today so if wired had been participating I guess they would have gotten paid.

I've been using it exclusively for a few months, well except at work, but I dont recall it ever having an issue with a website.  In fact websites seem to work better with it.  You should check it out.  try the mobile version and compare the load times yourself.  I compared it to safari and my old favorite Opera and they are all so fast I couldnt really say there was a difference.  But at least with Brave its not made by the company that makes money from advertisers directly like google.  The website for it puts a lot of emphasis on privacy which is something we could all use a little more of!
