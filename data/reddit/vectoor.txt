He said this in 1997 during the IT bubble, and specifically he said that the internet would have the economic impact of the fax machine by 2005. If you were more favorable you could just as well say that he predicted the IT crash...

Uhm, yeah where does he claim it was a joke piece? I know for a fact that he has admitted that he underestimated the impact of the internet. That said he wrote this during the IT bubble. In a way he was predicting the IT crash. And I mean it's not like he said that the internet is a fad, he said that by 2005 it would have a similar impact on productivity as the fax machine which really isn't all that crazy.
Interestingly enough, Krugman has actually been saying the opposite recently, that with the amount of emerging technologies right now we might just be looking at drastic economic implications.

Bernanke has said no such thing, I doubt he is a fan of bitcoins but this is ridiculous.

I feel like this is the most sensible article on bitcoins I've seen yet.

A fundamental part of Keynesianism is the idea that wages are, whether we want it or not, sticky. Prices and especially wages do not move up and down very fast. In fact average wages take years and years to adjust down and we tend to call those periods depressions. The babysitting coop doesn't have to be a perfect simulation of the economy, it is a tool that gives you a simple and intuitive grasp of a part of the problem.
