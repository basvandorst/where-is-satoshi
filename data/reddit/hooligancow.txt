That’s the crazy thing to, after the crash I hated in the banks as much as the next person and hoovered up all the YouTube videos and zeitgeist movies about federal reserve and debt in general. But somehow the planets never aligned and I never did a bitcoin video fall in my lap so I never saw it as the one thing I could do to fight back.

Thanks, that’s some of the feedback I needed. Regret just increases the risk of missing the next opportunity.

Thanks for your thoughts.  I think the difference between some of your first comments and bitcoin is there was never a chance in hell of me becoming an artist because of my upbringing, I could never be an entrepreneur because I need the security of big company job.  I did try and be a better husband and still try and be a better person.  The regret comes not from me missing it so much, but more from the fact that just one more article, or a random google search could have made the difference. Maybe I’m just mourning what could have been.  I completely agree with you tho, it is my attitude and my focus, and I continue to work on that to this very day.

Yeh, I started looking at the alts... then my brain kicked me when I was down because I had I been found bitcoin 6 months ago. I’d have gone looking for them just before some of them took off!  But you’re right, time to start seeing the opportunity still
