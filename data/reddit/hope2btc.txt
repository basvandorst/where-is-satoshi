Save "us"? Bitcoin doesn't need saving. I figured he was thinking the other way around.

Same as ATMs, no?

I'd much rather use bitcoinaverage.com, or anything actually working, than MtGox. Is there a new solution anyone can point me to? I'd like to accept BTC to a new address with each transaction. Any suggestions?

I'd prefer not to use a 3rd party. Though, they both make it very attractive. Thanks!

I don't think you're right about that.

If you want to eliminate the risk, your customers can pay in BTC through Bitpay, or Coinbase, and you can accept cash from them.
If you're like me and you'd just like to accept BTC, I'd love to hear of a good way to do that myself. [I posed this question the other day.](
Good luck!

One of my interests is in protecting privacy as much as possible. I see businesses that exist at the behest of the state as a weak point, and I'd rather not have to worry about them being in the middle of my transactions. I believe that blockchain.info means well and is a great service, but inevitably an unnecessary, weak, link.

Pseudonymity? Excitement over actually owning own money for a change?

It seems like when this type of thing comes up, many people bring up a bunch of alternatives of varying completion. Could someone list the options, and their differences?
