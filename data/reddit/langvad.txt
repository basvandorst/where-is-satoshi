 I hear what you are saying, I could write her again  and see if she can put the links up there.
I thought it was okay to set up a donation when I am not asking/begging for bitcoins for me.
If I have broken any rules and what I am trying to do is not allowed, then I´m sorry so I guess it would be pointless for her to put up the links :/
 
Thanks for your help anyways, maybe I´m abit naive to believe in the good of people, but I guess those people who are scammers will ruin it for those trying to do good, because seriously, what kind of horrible person would I be to try and be selfish on account of animals and mentally challenged people? I believe strongly in karma, which is why I want to help where I can!
Anyway at least I tried to do something good.

So don´t donate Kobayashi24, simple as that:)
 If you read what I wrote, I am not the owner, just trying to help a good cause which is the woman on the website.
I emailed her about the possibilities of btc. for her and she said it was an intersting thought and she would look into it. As you can see, she is not very IT savvy which is why I want to try and help her.
She is Danish, the shelter is here in Denmark, so that´s why it is not in english, like I said I just wanted to see if I can help this shelter.
As a way of proving this is real, I will let her write a letter for you guys here and translate it into English, if I can get some donations for her, don´t know what else I can do?
Guys if you don´t want to help that´s fine and I am a first time poster because I searched for danish forums first and stumbled over reddit when I googled, and thought that I could reach alot of people here.
