Inflation/Deflation can also be affected by Supply/Demand. I'm not sure if you missed that part or not.

But once they buy up everything off the market, they control the market. People can push theirs onto the market for whatever they want, but people won't buy in at super high prices when they know one entity holds so much. They CAN control bitcoin, which is exactly what I said above. People want to sell on exchanges, that single entity can buy it. Then what. Exchanges become pointless because one entity is buying it before others can? 
It would destroy and cause one entity to in theory control the outcome of Bitcoin. One of the many possibilities that can happen. You can phrase it or explain it any way, but the possibility of the coin being bought up or controlled is real at the current time.

Then why is it a lot people refer to price when they speak of inflation? In that case though, they're right Inflation isn't a problem except for the new 11% mined per year. Deflation is a problem when coins begin to be lost or forgotten day after day.
So the inflation part is handled, but what about the other part of the quote?

Oh look. I want to take $20 out. Better pay that 2.50 ATM fee because the ATM isn't owned by my bank (Holy shit, that's more than 10%). Oh god, the taxes on anything I purchase is going to be anywhere from 5 - 10% in the US, with up to 25% in places in Europe. We better complain about that 3% Circle fee though.
You think it's hard to use Bitcoin in Europe? Do you live in a hut. I've used it in London, Vienna, Prague, and I used it at a Subway in Bratislava. Don't get me started on how many places accept it online (Even for physical goods) in Europe. I haven't bought a game or movie for a year now with fiat. 
Now, I see you as an outsider who is too lazy to research how Bitcoin works, or to even throw a little money to see how it works. I explained it to multiple friends and family on Facebook. I even got 7 different people to buy some from Coinbase a few weeks back so they could try using it themselves. All of them thought it was really cool that there was an "internet currency" that allowed em to do things they normally do. One bought a Kohl's giftcard (US Store), one bought a PS3 off Cryptothrift(PS3, not PS4), and I got one using bit-keys for buying games, which is one of my favorite sites.
Either you're in here to bash Bitcoin, or you just haven't taken the time to learn or actually try it, or, you're just trolling for fun.

Inflation/Deflation based on supply/demand also exists, which people seem to forget. Being able to add more(print more in fiat terms) isn't the only thing that is considered "inflation". That's what I was getting at. Supply/Demand also affects inflation/deflation.

Well, at least someone understood what I meant. That's a good start. :P

Maybe if you're bad. Armory, Multisig, paper wallet. All of those are simple to actually use. Running Windows? Malware bytes, proper antivirus, etc, you're fine. Linux? Keep yourself updated, pay attention to any possible vulnerabilities. You're fine. Never hold coins on any type of exchange for too long.
Keeping your coins safe isn't rocket science. It only requires a bit of common sense.
Edit: I didn't read at start. No 2FA? That's always bad.

The growth would have to be exponential of course. At current market price. Hundreds of companies alone could buy all of Bitcoin at current marketcap. It would have to hit 10 times what it is now before it became sufficiently sufficient.
