is it sexist to have a boys and girls bathroom? is victoria's secret "sexist" because they differentiate between male and female clothing garments? are physical wallet companies sexist because they sell men's wallets and women's wallets? (usually called purses). as for generalizing, i dare you to type "girl bitcoin" and see what you get. is google "generalizing"? anyways, if you actually put some thought into your answer, that would be cool.

i'm a software engineer. there is a lot of software that is engineered differently for women. i hate to break it to you, but there is a biological difference between men and women, and it's a pretty widely know fact that tailoring products towards women and men is not only successful but it pleases the people who buy. social networking sites don't usually have a lot to benefit from making gender specific sites, but many others do. have you ever visited any sites that are only for girls? i could link you to some. maybe everything you own is unisex. maybe you are a hermaphrodite, and you feel angered by people who enjoy gender specific activities and services. by your logic, a purse would never sell, because it's sexist. there is really no difference between a bitcoin wallet and a physical wallet. you're right, they wouldn't need to program a wallet (or purse) any differently for a girl, they just slap a different user interface, a different look and feel. this is my first post in reddit and i'm already having fun :)

I think this is a great idea as well. But let's take it a step further.... what is the best method for a retailer to accept bitcoin? If there isn't one yet, who should we back and why? Maybe this is grounds for a different post.

so how would that work? like, lets say I wanted to buy a cup of coffee... how could a bitpay / bitcoin transaction beat me giving the guy a dollar? or swiping my card?
