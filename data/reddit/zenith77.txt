Are you an idiot? It's at the bank managers discretion whether he wants to allow money to transfer. How funny is it that you have the nerve to ask "how old are you?" Your inexperience speaks volumes.

It's not stealing. Just like banks can stop you from pulling out huge transactions, legally, bit coin exchanges can just go "fuck you" for an indefinite amount of time, legally, because there is no law stating when they have to allow you to trade/exchange.

you mean professional. This is what you do when you have an actual job. You do not bad mouth former employers. You relay events in a diplomatic way.

Well I'm just going to take this time to point out that you are literally crazy. 
Seek help.

No this smacks of
"We don't need 20 different posts telling us about the same thing."
There are IRC channels or make one post in this subreddit if the markets are acting volatile and then go sort by new. 
How daft can you be?

You seem to think that upvoting and downvoting on reddit are some kind of indication of quality.
It's not. 
By allowing that mindset you're just creating a circlejerk of a subreddit, not one based on disseminating useful information.

That's your response to a well thought out post? How stupid do you feel right now?
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:26:56
To the moon.

To the moon!

We are.
You can't jsut say "downvote" them because it's clearly not working out. We are bringing attention to the matter and hopefully getting mod intervention. 
It's ironic that you're telling me to shut the fuck up. I think you need to apply your own solution to yourself, since that is literally the entirety of your proposal for the rest of us.

How about you go to IRC instead of posting to a relatively static forum?
