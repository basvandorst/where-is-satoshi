Just tried to log in too, having the same issue. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:40:17
Works fine for me. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:51:25
Lol, I was going to give a few examples, but you are just a dumbass. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 18:42:16
You are misunderstanding the point, yet another retailer is accepting bitcoin. Are they the best? No, but i'll definitely use them more often now.

Buying and selling takes a few days. But the price you buy/sell at is locked in. 
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:26:05
Nice. And down we go.

Your temperature looks to be okay, don't pass 80C and you should be fine. Start GPU mining or wait for the market to dip back down and buy up. 
ASIC will change the game for better or worse if we can get them. -_-

Honestly if anyone falls for these types of scams, you deserve it.

Imgur does this automagically.

Seriously, without RES I wouldn't be able to browse reddit. Do you have a litecoin address? I could donate more if you do. :)

I love the mac minis, ha!

That is a really convincing ad. The African princes are getting better.
@_date: 2013-03-28 15:22:53
And bitcoin went no where fast either. 
@_date: 2013-01-23 17:00:36
Litecoin seems to be dying, there isn't many ways to use them. Buying $5-$10 worth of Litecoins moves the entire market. :/

Well China does have a population of 1.3 Billion.

Sweet! Did you pay in bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-03-28 16:56:52
Honestly I don't know. But I have completely switched over to litecoin. It is way more profitable, for me at least. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:49:55
Thanks, I'm gonna go stare at [this]( for a while. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:42:10
.Net is the legitimate site, I do not know about the .org but it looks fishy. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 04:12:41
RES will make reddit 100x better. And once you use it for a while you won't be able to go back to the 'old reddit.'
@_date: 2013-03-06 05:31:55
You're not alone.
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:40:08
Done, I want a video now! :p 
@_date: 2013-03-25 15:35:26
Very interesting, it could be possible and easy to do with some big players. 
@_date: 2013-02-20 05:24:26
Seems a little overkill, or am I missing something? 
@_date: 2013-03-07 00:16:10
Looks about right.
