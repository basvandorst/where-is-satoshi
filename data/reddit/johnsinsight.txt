Sincerest apologies and condolences. May your family and friends be supported.
Many missing the enormous returns, myself included, find rumination to be very difficult. The what/if game.
With that amount of Bitcoin a person could affect anything in life. Doubted one could arrive at that amount of worry over only self, he must've had huge plans for solving world and loved ones' issues from the billion+ usd that would convert to at this point. Perhaps concentrate on that, he was likely desiring to cause good change in the world. As many of us are who are balls deep in BTC and its world altering potential.
Listen to the guy who commented, Mt. Gox was likely how he lost it. Legalities are involved for potential recovery by immediate family. Perhaps it can be recovered and himself to live on in a legacy it could contribute to. The Mt. Gox issue is still being resolved, time will tell, and my best wishes to yourselves and all involved in the tragedy. 
God Bless.
PS Thank you for speaking up as a reminder to the treacherous road we pave. He was one of the innovators, if BTC alters global economy away from the hands of evil, one day a moment may be created in remembrance for those who have given all in hopes to change the world. Truly, money is all that matters unfortunately as it is access to every change good hubs want to see. But ruined by bottom line force of megacorp-govt complex siphoning every giblet of value from world citizens. 
May his sacrifice sober us to the real world battle of the citizens vs. megacorp-govt complex.
