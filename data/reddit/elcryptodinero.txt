ROI less than a year.

Yes, the market will always dictate your daily earnings.  A lot of factors come into play when calculating your potential earnings, such as algo difficulty, hashrate, pools, and BTC value.  The beauty of it is that you can decide how you want to do it.  If you want to mine ethereum and exchange it for fiat daily you can, or if there is an alt coin that you think has a bright future then you can mine it now while the difficulty is low and bank it in hope that the price will increase over time and cash out in a year.  Or you can join a pool that decides what you should mine based on current market and pay out directly with BTC.

Just a bit, mostly if you have to troubleshoot faulty hardware.  There is an enormous amount of information out there that can help you get started.  I would suggest starting small with only a couple of cards and maybe future proofing your motherboard and power supply incase you want to add more gpu's later.  I mine RVN and although it is a young coin, the community is strong and rapidly growing.  There is a lot of good info on if you wanted to further your research.

The golden rule of investment is don't invest what you can't afford to lose.

Love these ideas.  My little sister is getting married at the end of next year so as a gift I put $500 worth of BTC on a paper wallet and locked it away until the wedding day.  Her fiance is a banker and anti-crypto so I can't wait to see the look on this face when I finance their honeymoon with it!

Yes.  It is a good idea to contact your financial institution as well to inform them that this deposit will take place so it is not flagged as fraudulent.
