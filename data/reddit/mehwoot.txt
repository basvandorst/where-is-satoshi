It does that all the time.  And then sinks back down again.  It's at a 4 month low right now.

 (Simply known as the TAB in Australia)
Traditionally all Horse &amp; Greyhound racing betting in Australia operated this way.  If you placed your bet at odds of 10-1, and somebody came in and bet a huge amount  on the same pick, your payoff would decrease.  Nowadays you have more advanced methods of betting where a bookmaker will guarantee your odds as you place them, but this only works when you have a large enough pool and a lot of different events to bet on to amortise possible losses.  With fixed odds betting, the person taking the bet is committing to pay out some sum of money without knowing that somebody has taken the other side of the bet.  In this case, with only 1 market, that would be an extremely bad idea.  You could lose all the capital in your business in one bet gone wrong (and this happens to actual bookmakers who offer fixed-odds betting from time to time, for example in the 1997 Melbourne cup where people lost their entire business because of bets in a single race by one wealthy individual).

Because there is no way to protect the source address in practical usage.  If you say bought the coins off any legitimate website like Mtgox or using coinbase or whatever, it would be trivial (if they haven't already) for the government to demand records of who is using what addresses to send coins (given mtgox now requires government issued ID for "fiat money" transactions, they are clearly already collecting this information). 
For the coins to be anonymous, you need to obtain them in an anonymous way.  For most people, this isn't easy at all.

Assuming 20 million coins in circulation,
20,000,000 x 200,000 = $4,000,000,000,000
That's $4 trillion.  Which is roughly equal to the total amount of money of every single currency in the world combined.
Not completely out of range, but it would be pretty huge.

At $200,000 a coin with 20 million coins, that would be $4 trillion.  The total amount of USD in circulation is about $1 trillion.  So I think your math is off a bit.

Wouldn't there be a very obvious address that has deposited into the new address, and a very obvious address receiving money from the new address?  Unless you use a tumbling service, the network graph is very, very obviously going to show you where the money went.

Nobody would do that unless the odds being offered were fair, otherwise they would just be throwing away money.  If they did that, just bet on the opposite side because the chances are out of whack with the odds.
This is precisely how a lot of betting already works, see how the TAB works in Australia.

I really don't mean to be offensive, but considering almost every method of betting currently operating works like this, I think it's probably you who aren't following something.

Well, what are you going to say if the police ask you who you sent the coins to?  "Oh, some guy".  "Who?" "Uhhh...".  This sort of stuff works well in theory, but in practice, if the police keep seeing coins you bought being used to buy drugs... it is going to be unwelcome attention.
The much bigger problem is the other side of the transaction, the person selling the drugs.  We know from the indictment that hundreds of transactions were made by the FBI on silk road.  If they simply bought 2-3 things off the same buyer, and all those coins ended up at the same mtgox address which is linked to a physical address, you can bet they're going to search that person's house.  Again, that person could be very careful and use a different address and have nothing illicit in their house and keep repeating time and time again that it's just coincidence that they're buying coins off random people on the street who every time happen to have sold drugs to an undercover agent.  But practically this is going to cause a lot of problems for them.
I'm not a drug dealer (I'd hardly admit it if I was) but I would posit that once the police have reasonable suspicion you are dealing drugs, even if you have plausible deniability for the particular transaction that altered them, you're probably more than halfway to being caught.  It's like this comic:  might work in theory, but practically it isn't good enough.

So, you make easy money off them.  They won't be doing it for long.

Yeah, that's the same money being traded over and over and over again.  It's not $5.3 trillion individual dollars.  That's the logical step that's wrong- the annual FOREX trade gives absolutely no indicator as to the total amount of currency, and so it is useless for predicting what a bitcoin would be worth.
@_date: 2013-10-10 00:35:22
Because his conclusions are wrong.  At 100k each, 20 million bitcoins would be worth $2 trillion, which is twice the total amount of USD in circulation currently.  If 1% of the FOREX market = $2 trillion, then all the currency in the world should be worth $200 Trillion, when in reality it is worth roughly $4 trillion.
TL;DR the math is wrong.
