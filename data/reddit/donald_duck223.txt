How well does this perform for stuff like web browsing if implemented on modern fpgas? 
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:58:50
If they don't follow a significant potential improvement then they'll lose long-term. Again I'm not talking about superficial patches with a bunch of shady exploiters (as in bcash). I'm talking about legit improvements 
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:31:39

Bitcoin cannot become obsolete because it can adapt (not only with trashforks like bcash). Any attempt to make Bitcoin obsolete is good for Bitcoin because you can just adopt the changes
Edit :it looks like I triggered Roger vers bots
@_date: 2018-01-02 14:00:40
Yeah that's a good point but my personal speculation is that Bitcoins first mover advantage plus tradeoffs in other technogies offsets the conservative nature (not political but in terms of tech change) of the Bitcoin community and the opportunity costs of other alt tech. More important than all of this is overall crypto sentiment anyway 
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:21:33
Understanding the tech is just one piece of a puzzle. Recently There was a great post on here or on r/cryptocurrency where the op listed 15 questions every investor should ask himself before putting money into any cryptocurrency. I think the title was something like 'I am disappoint' 
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:27:22
Interesting that major Bitcoin investors include major people that were involved in Facebook :winklewii, Thiel, Napster guy etc. These guys are visionaries. Also good to see that they don't buy into shit coins. Edit, not sure if they also invest in alts
@_date: 2018-01-06 18:38:31
And those things are only possible if you buy Bitcoin to make a profit in fiat. If you believe in the currency, the fiat value is irrelevant 
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:49:29
Coinbase adopting segwit would cause a domino effect with all other exchanges imo
@_date: 2017-12-05 00:58:42
If you don't enjoy university (more than tuition money x100) , it doesn't make any sense to pay tuition. Just drop out and put the tuition money into Bitcoin

Exactly this. Volatility is good for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:42:51
I appreciate your comments because I agree with them
Edit another piece of advice :stop loss
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:06:18
There's pretty much an ISP monopoly/duopoly for most Americans. Even when Google, an almost 1 trillion dollar company, wanted to enter, they ran into issues brought on by Comcasts regulatory capture. Those monopolistic regulations are bad, not net neutrality. Only thing that will happen with the removal of net neutrality is that the service provided by the main players will be shittier (probably only a little shittier but we'll see) 
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:37:49
 is what I have to say about that
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:48:33
This needs to be stickied and pinned to the sidebar. It's critical that segwit be adopted quickly. Crypto evolves fast and we only have first movers advantage on our side
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:19:06

I know it's a meme but seriously this is good for Bitcoin long term. Lower prices means more sensible people buy (for transactions or real HODL) good riddance for all the fomos

One of bcash's founding fathers. Most people probably hate him for acting douchy. I don't like him because he's the Francis Underwood of Bitcoin, two faced scheming behind the scenes, abusing his power to enrich himself even more. He's close to being a billionaire

I have previously taken a loan to buy Bitcoin and still came out ahead after paying back the base plus interest. My rate is pretty good though and it was, relatively speaking, not a lot. Not saying that anyone should do this or that it's a good idea in general

Only $1B per coin? That's too pessimistic.... 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:50:20
Why is Bitcoin better than altcoins like iota? There was a thread here once that linked to r/cryptocurrency where they said Bitcoin tech is obsolete and altcoins resolved all of Bitcoins problems but I don't remember what our counter arguments were
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:46:55
True. Interesting factoid : Satoshi will be the richest person on the planet shortly after that 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:48:48
Typo, the reverse. But Bitcoin dominates gold (ez transactions compared to selling gold) so it doesn't mean we can't get there
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:36:56
Can you elaborate on why onchain purists promote centralization in all those things? Doesn't the lighting network cause more centralization by creating a few high degree nodes? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:43:31
Additionally to all the other comments. They don't support segwit

Don't all off chain transactions of LN eventually have to be committed, thus only removing repeated transactions of A to B over some timespan? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:58:18
Ironically this proves the grounding principle of Bitcoin being critical : decentralization. All the more reason to have your own wallet. Conbase not only doesn't have segwit for core, now they pander to bcash 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:29:17
Never call it Bitcoin cash, always call it for the s**tcoin it is: bcash

@_date: 2017-12-20 11:16:20
Let's get this trending
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:07:34
I phrased the first question poorly. I don't see HOW that leads to centralization. Keeping everything on chain maintains the distributed nature, or not? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:01:43
Something that pretends to solve Bitcoins limitations as a currency. If you look under the hood it's not really a scalable fix. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:41:43
8x is lipstick on a pig. As you write in your other posts, LN trades off speed against centralization. I feel there will be a point in the future where Bitcoin will hard fork into something beyond LN at level 1 that puts bcash's 8x to shame. If you want to give up on Bitcoin already, why not invest in IOTA? why half ass it with bcash? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:59:03
Unger called it rat poison not buffet ffs

Saying this is Bitcoins fault is saying guns shoot people by th themselves
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:55:09
There's a reason Satoshi didn't convert his Bitcoins into bcash. Any future revolutionary hard fork is more significant from core than from bcash. If we value practicality over the established pioneer, there no reason to pick any existing Bitcoin fork over iota. Bcash is a half assed compromise. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:05:49
Why would conbase want to investigate their own con? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:55:58
What's fomo
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:22:39
If the bcash folks in a coordinated and widespread attack only trigger a 10% fall, that speaks more about Bitcoins strong hands and its resiliency. Bitcoin will find a way to scale, time is on our side. Bcash only has empty promises, they will reach their bottleneck soon enough 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:42:18

@_date: 2017-12-16 21:25:22
Thanks for linking to the video. Overall, I think Gates was more optimistic about it than Munger and the 'government intervention comment' can be interpreted in several different ways. Are they going to ban crypto to fiat? Are they going to mandate that crypto owners disclose ownership? And at what point are they going to intervene: when it's used for illegal activities more than fiat or when crypto comes close to overtaking physical circulation fiat? Personally, I feel very confident that non authoritarian countries will leave crypto alone. For the US, the extent of the most invasive ruling would probably be an annual disclosure to the treasury for amounts over say 10k$
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:17:45
I think the same thing will happen for the lighting network.  I wouldn't be surprised to see a single vendor dominate the market. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:20:22
Another great comment. Even if there were a bubble, I'd be unphased. It could drop to 1k and I'd still hold. The fiat demand is irrelevant, what matters is the future of the currency
