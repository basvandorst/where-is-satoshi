Not what I meant.
@_date: 2013-06-09 01:56:00
You misinterpreted my reasoning.

Not really. I'm saying tor is no guarantee. From a security standpoint just because you use tor doesn't guarantee anonymity. Machines themselves can be compromised. Not necessarily tor programming. Though i would be suspicious of any US milirary project that claims to fully protect its users and then is openly offered to the public free of charge.  That's why I'm done. You say nothing of security concerns. Your only response was "Im an expert, listen to me." I have no reason to trust your claims online. All you've really brought to the discussion was a questionable attitude.
And another thing, governments in the middle east during the "Arab Spring" defeated tor using deep packet inspection and had their ISP block tor traffic. Its not fool proof. "Experts."

Your smug aside. A centralized server is not the only way to monitor or capture traffic. I'm not here for a tech pissing contest. I already know how onion routing works. This about reasonable privacy.

No, it never occured to me /s.  Civilian use of basically military supported anonymity.  I don't trust things I didn't produce. That simple. No software is fool proof. And security vulnerabilities cannot always be coded out. You're picking bad arguments.

How so?
@_date: 2013-06-08 19:06:41
Can you enlighten us on its function? How does onion routing actually work?

Tor is trackable. Who runs the exit nodes? Remember that Tor, like Arpanet, was a project of the DoD.  Tor is still supported financially and developmentally by the Department of the Navy. Its one of their pet projects for fuck's sake.

Because you seemed so eager to prove some kind of point. We're done here.
@_date: 2013-06-09 00:06:27
It does.  They wouldn't waste money on communications tech like that and release it for free without some kind of benefit.  That would be a total loss and they'd eventually just drop it.

Black people; enbu's number one deal breaker.
@_date: 2013-06-09 00:03:37
Believe what you want.  But it still makes no strategic sense on part of the Department of the Navy or the Department of Defense to develop some sort of fool proof open network for privacy without a counter-measure.  That's a losing move.

Why would *only the US nodes be tapped? Remember, you're still trusting someone to not screw you. And the intelligence community is a worldwide network; an information economy. It crosses boarders and treaties for its own ends.
Additionally: The US intel infrastructure is the stock market of the worldwide intelligence net. Every country is involved on some level, and some more actively than most. There's a lot of money to be made.
