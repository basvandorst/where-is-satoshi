True in many ways, but never forget that life is short and a decade is a lot if time.

Note that Coinbase when showing prices for europeans it naively convertss the current bitcoin's USD price to EURO.  However there is almost always a difference between the GDAX price of bitcoin on us and euro exchange. When you try to convert euros to bitcoin  then it remembers to use the current euro rate. They need to fix this as it creates a lot of confusion.

My wild guess: most people on own bitcoin. The distribution is a power law like most things that stem from human activity (check distribution of city sizes for example). 
If you are looking for specifics I would say 0.1% with more than 100 bitcoins, 1% with more than 10 bitcoins and 10% with more than 1 bitcoin. This means that 90% have less than 1 bitcoin...

The exact numbers are more around bitcoin holders rather than users. As the community here is more focused it seems reasonable to have a higher concentration of bigger holders.
But then this is just a guess based on reasonable thinking. I am pretty certain that this is a power law distribution but we do not know the coefficients which makes a huge difference.

You don’t need a direct channel to everyone. Just a way to connect to a node through different hubs and over multiple channels (and assuming those channels have enough capacity to complete your transaction). It works similar to internet.

How this would effect my “can receive” amount? Is that controlled from the “can spend” amount on their side?

Looks promising! 
Check how it looks in a iPad, there are multiple visual things that can be improved there.

Here are the details:

Another question based on your explanation. 
A merchant wants to receive payments instead of sending payments. This seems very hard to be implemented through lightning as he/she has to spend money first. How this is supposed to be handled in practice?

Thanks for the detailed explanation. I am tech savvy so I understand why I experience those differences. 
UX wise we need to further simplify it for the average Joe though. 
Having an amount locked on the channel, combined with the amount for the initial Bitcoin transaction means that it makes sense to fund a channel with a “sufficient” amount to reduce the percentage of fees. This can be counterintuitive to the very nature of lightning who favors micro-transactions. At the very least, different fees and locked amounts should be communicated through the app.

It will happen. But before, 99% of believers will be convinced it will never happen.

Not in a significant way at least. Countries are very conservative entities.

It was the easiest ios app around lightning I have tried. Definitely worth the effort.
It creates your own cloud node which is very convenient - although probable not too safe. But lightning is for popcorn money so in most practical cases it is as good as needed.
It does many things properly. For the average Joe it should hide all tech jargon messages though. 
Overal, this is a big move forward regarding user experience around lightning!

Bitcoin is to gold what cars are to horses.

In the regular world this level of development would span a full year and not just a month. I am mostly here about the excitement!
