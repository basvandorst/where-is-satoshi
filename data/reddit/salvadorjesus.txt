Well, remember that banks appeared before fiats. I am looking forward for cryptobanks, too.

I always refrain myself of saying that. Being this such a common mistake for native English speakers, I always feel that this is going to feel rude, and that I'm going to be branded as a grammar nazi or whatever. But given the amount of positive votes you've got, I might change my mind. This is a huge pet peeve of mine.

That's great to hear! :D ����

I heard somewhere that scammers act like that to filter out normal people, thus making sure they are working only with the most gullible people out there.

Haha, sorry about that! :-)

Point of Sale. It's an app to use in business, for example. Think on a restaurant owner setting up the app in their employees phones or in the restaurant PC. Employees can charge clients without having access to the owner's funds.
Since it does not use your seed or your private keys, you can also use the app to request payments without the fear of being robed if assaulted, for example.

Thank you!
I'm going to try to answer you the best I can, but I'm not sure if I understood you properly.
As you can read in my other [comment]( to this post, there are two ways of charging with the app (two tabs in the charge page):
- Payment Link: This is an on-chain link (only) to any of the addresses in the app.
- Issuing a ticket: The ticket will have two QR: One for lightning and one on-chain. Those are generated by OpenNode and, actually, if the amount is larger than their channel capacity, the ticket will only have an on-chain QR. Both tickets are labelled.
Is it possible that you have missed the second QR? 
You can pay with any wallet to the on-chain QR (most LN wallets have options to pay with either with LN or on-chain). But you need a LN wallet to pay using the LN QR. I'm not sure if Coinomi supports LN yet, but I'm taking that not. Then you'd need to use the second QR.
If you pay a ticket with the on-chain link you will see that it changes to processing and then to paid (remember to hit the refresh button).
I'm attaching an screenshot (interface is in Spanish, sorry).
I'm writing a manual. It will be online next week.

Thank you very much for taking the time to check the app and for your comment!
There are two ways to charge with the app: With a **payment link** and with a **ticket**.
A **payment link** is a bitcoin link to an address. You need to add an address first (\*). When you use a payment link, there are some shortcomings:
* Payment goes to the same address. Payers can explore that address and see how much you earn. You can, however, add several addresses.
* Although you can see the address movements, you can not be sure who paid what (think of two clients paying a soda, at the same time, to different waitresses).
Or you can issue a “**ticket**”. Tickets have some advantages over links:
* Each ticket has different address as a payment destination. Payers cannot monitor your earnings.
* Each ticket is saved separately, and you can check when each individual ticket is paid, without possibility of confusions.
Currently, the only way to issue tickets with the app is using an OpenNode account. The guys at open were very supportive. Their solution is slick, in my opinion: It can be very convenient for those who don’t have the skills or time to learn and manage crypto (i.e.: Most business owners). Plus, they have an off-ramp service, which can be very valuable for beginners and experts alike.
Issuing tickets with the OpenNode account has other advantages:
* You can pay with Lightning! You don’t need to have a node up and running in order to receive payments. They do it for you.
* Each ticket has also an on-chain address. As you guessed, those are managed by OpenNode and returned by its API, along the Lightning payment request. Even if they are on-chain, those addresses are unique to each ticket, so you retain all the advantages of working with tickets (they call them charges).
In a future update I plan to add the possibility of issuing tickets with an **XPUB address**. So, there will be two ways of issuing a ticket:
* Using Open Node (custodial service, Lightning, off-ramp)
* Using XPUB (user-controlled wallet, on-chain only).
Thanks again for your comment!
*(\*) On Windows, there are two addresses by default in the app, so you can start playing with them (donations address to this app and to BitcoinVenezuela.com). On Android, there are none, because Google Play didn’t like the donation bit not going through the Play Store and rejected the app.*

That's my app! :)
Also available in Windows. If you want to know more: 
We are working hard to have LN with Open Node integrated ASAP.

Coinbase for example, no? Didn't they open the £ markets some months ago?

Let me quote a paragraph from this news:


@_date: 2018-05-06 23:09:51
Why do you think this was caused by a virus on the first place (rather than, for example, bad practices on your part, being victim of an elaborated fraud o just pishing)?
Are you sure about that, or it is just a way of speaking?

That’s great to hear! I would be very glad if she or her friends find this helpful. Thank you for spreading the word.

No, it's not. I guess it would be the case as in Spain, where I live. Most of the people have twelve salaries, one per month. But some people, and that used to be the norm back in the day, have fourteen salaries: one per month, plus one "extra" during the summer and Christmas holidays.
It's the same amount per year either way. In some companies you can choose between both system (that is, how you want to split you annually gross income): "Twelve or fourteen payments".

For the record, I am not a Venezuelan myself, if that is what you mean, but yes, I hope it helps!

Do those things also give you fiat in exchange of Bitcoin? If so, how do they work?
@_date: 2019-08-27 18:51:58
Why is that?
@_date: 2019-08-30 10:49:12
I fail to see this implication. Care to elaborate?
To illustrate where my mindset is, to make your life easier:
Gold and silver have coexisted as sound money for centuries. No problem.
If you ask some groups, Bitcoin fails to be sound money because it is not fungible (as others crypto are).
I'm very interested on this. Thanks! ��

How is fiat sort of PoS? Thank you.

Yep, he knew. And he meant that it is not free, and that although everybody knows that, a reminder was due.
I found his way original, actually. Never heard that before.

What about Nano? Sounds promising. Anything I don't see?
@_date: 2018-04-23 22:22:27
I see it as a more or less trustable middleman between me (and my credit card numbers) and a random internet merchant.

If governments were run like businesses, taxes would not exist; they would rather be invoices for those who choose its services. ;)

Be prepare for a lot of maximalism as well. Don't fall for it. While many of other projects, or altcoins, have no future or are just scams, there are plenty of very interesting projects out there. Just be cautious.
Oh, and many people don't like it if you discuss other coins in this sub. Beware.
Good luck!

Welcome to the **rabbit hole**!
Don't worry, with all the resources available today, the basics are easy to grasp. If you take it seriously, you are about one day of readings away to understand crypto. As you will be tomorrow. And the day after tomorrow. And the following day... �� 
Have fun!
