It solves Taxes uncertainty. Theoretically if I would exchange BTC for my local currency, it could be looked at as if it is a capital gain, although it is not (I just happen to have some coins from mining/long time ago). This way, I can directly spend it, that is, exchange money (BTC) for stuff, and I only pay standat VAT.
PS: I just received my Xapo card, but had no chance to try it (yet!).

Are you telling me that if I have 100 SomeNonLocalCurrency in a box for travelling and they are now worth more because the exchage rate change, and I go and buy stuff for them abroad, I should go and report this as a capital gain? I don't think this is the case, but correct me if I'm wrong.

There is no way of knowing. As far as I know there is no public LN code available, and I haven't seen much news about it lately. There is, however an updated whitepaper from January 14, 2016:
I skimmed it, but it doesn't seem to contain the answer you're looking for.
@_date: 2016-06-30 22:12:28
Thanks, I didn't find them! 
I looked both at the lightning.network and ElementsProject webs, but didn't find them. There doesn't seem to be link to github on the lightning.network, and the ElementsProject links only to the "elements" repo, which doesn't reference the lightning. Perhaps this is something that can be improved if the correct people read this.
Now excuse me, I'll go and browse the code!

Maybe I'm reading it wrong, but the roadmap you linked says:


Granted, the asterisk says it's not really true, as deployment in this context doesnt actually mean "deployment", but "have a code that could be theoretically deployed, but isn't really tested or ready yet".


I't almost a year since segwit was very close to being ready and will solve current issue before they become serious. I'm still waiting.
Disclaimer: I really don't care about the technical, I just want a great bitcoin network again, that works fine without having to worry about full blocks and politics.

And what catches my eye: what's the source code from in 0.21 - 0.22? :-)

Sure, the PoW mining draws a lot. Storage is cheap energy-wise and is not a problem now and in the near future. But once you'll need many TB of disk space just to store the chain (and someone will have to, even if most of the network runs pruning), other problems will arise, for example failing drives in the arrays and such. But we'll see where the HDD tech will be then.

If your reasonable transaction is not confirmed in the next block (considering it got to the miner), it's a sign of stress to the network and it becomes much easier to spam it.


I doubt there is something like small miners. If you have the resources to mine bitcoin solo and produce a block in any relevant time, you probably have the resources to have reasonable connection (even to china).


I hear this a lot. True, but only if you consider "spam and wasteful txns" to be malicious transactions. Once  you consider transactions from real users, who want to do something (pay for coffee) a spam, you're playing a god in the bitcoin world, which doesn't seem to fit into the decentralized ideals. And you can't expect people to do transactions off chain if there is no reasonable infrastructure to do it.


There are solutions (for example ethereum's uncles). Also this might be the motivation of moving most of the hashing power out of china...
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:42:00
Nope, a few more. All of my transactions are a bit bigger, as most of my inputs are small.. There has been a few in the recent few week (let's say 10).
@_date: 2016-05-12 22:26:09
Nope. We know about the pools. But what would happen if few hashers decided that they won't pay for electricity anymore, double-spent all their coins and walked out the game. The fact is all the hashing power is in hands of relatively few people. I don't know the stats, and I don't think anyone does for sure.
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:09:20
It's hard to define. I usually wait for a tx to clear for a few hours. People usually ignore it, deny it, or blame others.
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:33:15
Yes. And in the past people were encouraged to use bitcoin for daily transactions, to spread the word so bitcoin would become more popular. People usually said it won't get wider adoption while everyone's hoarding bitcoins and not spending them.
Today the sentiment seem to be reversed, which I find sad, especially if there is no working and widespread lightning/other sidechain that would take them over...
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:30:44
And they probably will. I wonder how many miners are ready for the halving and how many will turn the power off, sell gear on ebay and exit the game with good money earned, instead of hoping for higher prices in the future.
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:20:52


No. But the havoc it wreaks on the community IMHO is.


Right. I agree it's better do to stuff slowly but right. But why don't we compromise instead of splitting into camps and fighting about it, moreover if there is the possibility of moving step by step.


Right, good point!
@_date: 2016-05-12 14:52:50
Sure, Google can't take over bitcoin. But a few Chinese guys can do whatever they want, that's much better. 
Asicboost is arguably the next gen asic. I think nobody shares their asic masks, and patents never stopped the Chinese manufacturers...
@_date: 2016-05-12 14:45:06
Really? If there is 20% edge between monopolization and current state, we should definitely fork out all asics, as cheap electricity can push this to monopoly as well!
@_date: 2016-05-16 19:53:32
Sure, and I acknowledged that and corrected myself.
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:13:23
Sure. I get that. I ignore the FUD. But when stuff becomes real, it's no longer FUD. And the fact is, that I haven't seen any civilised discussion for some time, and there are skilled people not working toghether (core/unlimited and different "lightning" teams for example). 
Edit: Psychological attack is pretty good description to what's happening, I agree. I'm not sure if it originates from outside though. If there were less problems (ie the scaling issues), this would not be possible, or at least a lot harder.
@_date: 2016-05-16 19:14:35
I don't. I phrased it incorrectly, as I'm operating on the worst-case assumption. However, this is the correct approach, as I am aware of no evidence that would tell otherwise.
If you don't know who all the hashers are does not mean they are decentralized.
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:05:06
I mostly agree, though I don't think blocks are currently full due to someone intentionally spamming. And I agree that zero fee transactions are a problem. If someones wants to do it, let them do it.
The shouting model is allright. But the groups need to communicate between themselves, otherwise they won't work (efficiently) towards the goal.
I'm also not sure if it's worth more than a year of endless debate and bad blood just not to waste our safety margin. Who decides when it's time to waste it and on what? I personally think that if the community would be working, a lot of smart minds would come in and come up with some better solution than almost anything we have today. But honestly, the atmosphere is so thick that I don't see how anyone would want to join, just to be shouted on from multiple sides of the argument that noone remembers where it began.
Sure, I'm looking forward to segwit, if it will be rolled out soon. I'm not sure when the soon will be and I think it's way too late. 
The workaround is a good thing, because you can take your time and make sure the proper fix is right the first time it's deployed. Now we're rushing a lot of non-trivial code into production, just because we wouldn't waste some margin here and there.
And sure, we can't procrastinate, but that has nothing to do with what we roll out. In the end, SegWit and bigger blocks are both workarounds and lightning is still miles away. And I don't think that lightning is the right solution anyway, as I see it's biggest advantage in bundling small transactions between two subjects together. This is fine, but I doubt today's network would benefit from this greatly.
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:14:38
Sure, wouldn't have it any other way. I'm usually not participating in uncivilised discussions, as it's a waste of time.
@_date: 2015-02-15 20:07:44
Well, I had a good time learning iMacros to hack it. Unfortunately, paying for the captchas is 3x more expensive than the gain, and I won't be giving them my coins :-)
@_date: 2016-05-20 16:49:14
Because mine was bigger (multiple inputs) and the wallet didn't specify fee high enough I guess. I could have fiddled with the fee manually, if I realizes in time. But again, someone else would have waited instead of me...
@_date: 2016-05-11 19:34:58
I don't get it. ELI5 why we should fork out AsicBoost, but not ASICs themselves? ASICs are causing much more centralization than AsicBoost ever could.
@_date: 2016-05-20 17:39:55


Perhaps it's not bad. But it's so looong and I'm getting tired of it.


Yes. The problem with classic is it doesn't bring almost any other benefit. It has some ideological benefits, but that's nothing against the economical incentives in play. I think Unlimited has some good stuff that is innovative and could be merged into core. But it's not (or is it? I'm not aware of anything), because we don't like each other.


Sure, there has to be. "640K ought to be enough for anybody." That's one reason why I find it especially bad to split the community over something, that will eventually happen, just a bit later.
