The reason there is a limit of about 7 transactions per second, is because a transaction is so many bytes, and 7/sec would end up to about 1 Mb in 10 minutes.  Since the blocksize in bitcoin is limited to 1 Mb, this cannot grow, so in reverse, there cannot be more then 7/sec.  
There are ways around it,  Gavin Andreesen proposed to increase the block chain limit is one, but there is also factom, which i visualise as small mini-blockchains between the bitcoin one.

its getting pretty normal for me already to go to the supermarket with bitcoin. i am not rich, so i get 10 euro in bitcoin form a local ATM and spend 8 euro on bitcoin in the supermarket.  so every time i save a little bitcoin for my retirement :)

i live in this area. I cant get this grin off my face now :) i am for sure going to shop there to support !
The strange situation in my town now is that i can buy everything with bitcoin now EXCEPT drugs!

i try to visualize things to explain stuff to a dummy like myself.  If i say that, bitcoin is a train running on the blockchain rails, is counterparty then a merchant in the same train, buying and selling stuff, but as currency he can only use the bitcoin train tickets ? is this assumption correct ?
@_date: 2014-11-30 15:19:08
Just patiently keep using them :) in my town i can go to a bitcoin ATM and put 10 euros in it, and then i can go to a supermarket and spend 8 euros on bitcoin. This gives a lot of possibilities, for example, when i buy bitcoins in a dip , that's about the same as having a discount in the supermarket. At the same time i save bitcoins and I (as many people here)  expect that the bitcoin will really go to the moon, in 2 years from now. Apart from this, i can buy shares in bitcoin that give divident, for only a few cents. This used to be only for rich people not too long ago...

Bitcoin is an enabling technology for the 'internet of things'.  Suddenly each 'thing' is going to be an economic entity and can make decisions and even investments to improve on itself. Imagine your toothbrush making sure there is always enough toothpaste. otherwise the human will replace the obsolete toothbrush with a better one that always does order the toothpaste in time. With bitcoin/cryptos the 'things' suddenly get a means of living and thus a reason to 'live'.

a new type of logistics program: imagine you want to build a plane, and you use a lot of subcontractors. in old tech, this is an organizational nightmare. in bitcoin, take 1 bitcoin and assign an unique number of satoshis to each part to be delivered. These satoshis travel with the parts through the subcontractors.  Your plane is complete to the last nuts and bolts if you end up with 1 bitcoin agian after assembly.  Because you assigned unique numbers of satoshis you can see which part is missing.

you could give them a QR code on a sheet of paper, so people can scan that to tip them

I also shopped there last week, and i plan to do so more often.  I can now go to the bitcoin ATM to get bitcoin, and spend a little less at this grocery store, so i save some bitcoins every time :)
Of course the personnel is still getting used to it, but hey there is a first time for a lot of people. In a month or so they won't even blink when you ask to pay in bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-12-08 15:30:31
does that mean yo don't have to pull the thumb out of yo asses but actually leave it there ? :)
@_date: 2014-12-08 15:02:40
i don't see it as expensive. As a big believer in bitcoin i think bitcoin under 500 us$ is still very, very cheap. So assuming the ATM takes 1-2% this is a tiny loss compared with the fact that i have new, extra, shiny bitcoins in my wallet. Besides, if i bought bitcoin by other channels i would also pay a fee. Of course i do look at prices in the grocery store, they are generally more expensive then my neigborhood supermarket, but not all items are expensive. Items like tobacco are the same everywhere so that is my favorite item to buy. The point for me is, i can buy bitcoin in very small amounts, since i am a poor guy and cant just throw some spare banknotes at bitcoin. I know many more people who would like to save money and i tell them, this could be their way out of poverty, with some patience lol

Money laundering is needed to clean these stinking pieces of paper, full with bacteria, cocaine and maybe even ebola so they can be used again and infect someone else later :)

the total amount of bitcoins will be 21 million in the year 2140AD. so for a mortal human the effective number of bitcoins is already reached, at about 11 million.  now imagine that everyone worldwide starts using bitcoin, then there are 11 million bitcoins to be shared with 7 billion people. In that case a single bitcoin could be worth a LOT. someone calculated that if you have only 0.05 bitcoin then you are future millionaire. It could also fail of course, but i think its a pretty safe bet to take :) Faucets are indeed paying horribly.  it is better to do 'real' work and just buy bitcoin. Mining is also paying horribly these days, since mining a bitcoin is getting more and more difficult over time, you need a lot of computing power right now. it is out of reach now for normal humans with a home computer. (ok, almost.  you could mine a little using a multipool but if you're not technical, don't bother). So the best you can do is to buy some and keep it safe for a while, and start learning,  because bitcoin (as currency)  is just the beginning :) for more possibilities of bitcoin, look up bitnation.co for example. also, see some youtube videos with speaker andreas antonopoulos. hope this will get you started :)

i can imagine a future though where millions of people invest less then a dollar, so if there is a scam, millions of people also will complain about it.  Now we just have to wait for an agency that brings scammers to justice, for millions of dimes from the same investors.

tueeesdaaaayyy!! hi !
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:13:56
i remember a time when i told people that computers were the future and i advised people to learn about them.  Nobody cared even a little. 15 years forward, and only the last of the deniers still refused to use a computer.  30 years forward, and people who don't use a computer are left out of the system as a whole. The morale here is, don't try to convince people of something they simply don't have the will, time or brainpower to understand.  Eventually they will have to learn about it or being left out. New apps are invented every day that use bitcoin, and even the total deniers will use it even if they do not know they do. Every worldwide revolution took some 10 years at least, bitcoin is just in its 6th year.

Definitely an interesting read :) excerpt from the article :
Inspired by RFC 2549, on 9 September 2009, the marketing team of The Unlimited, a regional company in South Africa, decided to host a tongue-in-cheek "Pigeon Race" between their pet pigeon "Winston" and local telecom company Telkom SA. The race was to send 4 gigabytes of data from Howick to Hillcrest, approximately 60 km apart. The pigeon carrying a microSD card, versus a Telkom ADSL line.[9] Winston beat the data transfer over Telkom's ADSL line, with a total time of two hours, six minutes and 57 seconds from uploading data on the microSD card to completion of download from card. At the time of Winston's victory, the ADSL transfer was just under 4% complete.

since the right to make the next block is essentially a lottery, would it be in theory possible that this lottery is won after, say,  1 second instead of the desired 10 minutes? on the other side, could it take , say, 3 hours ?

Any use of the blockchain is in fact a free ad for bitcoin (and some altcoins). Even though the use of 'blockchain technologies' dont necessarily push up the price, it will make people want to buy/sell stuff with bitcoin.  That will push price up.

Well let just hope there will be a smooth transition, but if not, my guess is that after the next stock market crash, the world will suddenly realize that the emperor is without clothes. 
This will probably lead to a giant drop of the 'stronger' currencies for the simple reason that there are more of these printed then the 'weaker' currencies which will first gain in value, but then also fall like tree-leaves in autumn.
The people who got hold of bitcoin (and/or gold) in time, the ones who always had a bank account, will prevail. The others will be left out.
If this does not lead to a massive civil unrest, and countries are still standing, there is no way to put labor-tax on them. The only way a govt is going to get tax income is by utility-based tax ( e.g. payment for removing trash, the internet-of-things can greatly help there), so in my view, govts should prepare with lowering or removing labor-tax and shift to utility-tax before the great transition.
After this we will be having a very small govt who hopefully are not capable anymore of war mongering with printed money. a bright future may be around the corner in the end.

wow very nice ! i will check out some of the links
@_date: 2015-01-13 14:17:29
i agree. the only reason the bitcoin can go down is because there are less then 3600 bitcoins hoarded per day.  If some BigBadGuy wants to crash the bitcoin, he only has to buy all 3600 of them, and sell them for 0.10 less.  this will cost ONLY 360 us$/day for them.  But this trick only works as long as there are not enough takers and hoarders. Soon, the remittance market will really take off, and instead of 'a few nerds' buying bitcoin, there will be billions of people. the hoarding goes to more then 3600/day, and then the train really will take off.

Check if there is a bitcoin ATM (also called a BTM) in your neighborhood.  put money in, let the machine make a picture of your QR code on your phone ( where your wallet is)  and hit a button. The  coins are never in your wallet, but in the 'blockchain' a worldwide 'database' that cannot be hacked basically because all miners have a copy (and nobody can hack all the copies). Your wallet only holds the private key ( compare:password)  to an address on the blockchain.

thanx for the answer :) still i find it a bit odd that there was no minimum blocktime build in 
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:32:24

@_date: 2015-04-07 19:34:35
i would say new heights, for the simple reason that every bitcoin hoarded is one less on the market.  big boys are trading but of course also hoarding, and there are more big boys entering the room, with only some 14 million BTC to share. do the math :)
@_date: 2015-04-28 21:54:33
since bitcoin is a limited resource, every single transaction with a new user will spread  it further.  It does not matter that there are now some people with a load of them, since they will always spend and have less of them. Unless they really work for new coins,  unlike some people that can live on free printed fiat money...
I guess you could call that bitcoin entropy.
@_date: 2015-04-20 07:57:37
I remember when the first bitcoin ATM came out in vancouver, in no-time there was a guy sitting next to the ATM undercutting fees. So yes, in the long run ATMs will disappear because everyone can be a bank.

Every watt you put in is eventually tuned into heat, so in basic its a good plan.  The only problem is the price of your 'heater' but if you buy obsolete second handed miners then my guess is you would be best off (save heating costs and still have some bitcoin, without spending too much on your heater)

I tend to disagree, the circle of acceptance does not start with merchants. In my town, there are over 50 shops accepting bitcoin, including a supermarket. But the population is not following yet en masse.  I think the acceptance will come when one day some computer game comes out where you can earn bitcoin, or people are starting to understand changetip.  Then they will want to spend the bitcoin and because that, merchants do follow.
@_date: 2015-04-20 17:54:40
GetGems is already doing that. It turns around old business models, in case of getgems you get paid when someone wants to send you ads. So instead of facebook monetizing you, you can monetize yourself :)

I don't really agree here.  Virtual is a word used for things that do not really exist. The bitcoin community kinda decided a while ago to use the term 'digital' because otherwise your grandmother thinks it doesn't exist, so using 'digital' makes discussions easier. But at the same time, there is no such thing as a bitcoin (digital or otherwise) because its in the ledger, and what you think of as 1 bitcoin is actually a collection of unspend transaction outputs. So actually the term virtual would be more precise. ( i use digital though, for the same reason, it makes discussions easier :)

the limit is because the max blocksize is currently 1 MB.  since a transaction is so many bytes, only a limited number fit in a block.  since 1 block takes 10 minutes ( on average) that translates back to about 7-10 transactions per second.
