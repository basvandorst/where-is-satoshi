These exchanges are based on bids which fluctuate from people overselling or underselling from its true value. Mean reversion trading explains this. The waves are created by people trying to force prices up and down based on news and the status of Bitcoin. 
That 1000+ spike was from an influx of coin from a war I believe I think it was croation rebeliion. Basically the government money became useless from revolution so they resorted to Bitcoin for currency. Then people began mining the crap out of it which brought it back down to where it is today. But the spike got it in the spotlight which is great and is starting to pay off now.
Overall if you are trying to buy and hold and sell later like  a stock than bitcoin is where you want to be but bigger profits will be in alt coin exchanges

thats how it works if you haven't picked that up yet. Very few changes in  crypto land are genuinely caused by the status and use of the coin.

There is no risk at all with accepting bitcoin when you cash out immediately. Just lower transaction fees. 
I often wonder why 5% discounts which seem to be the norm for most bitcoin acceptors. Were you paying more for credit transfer fees before that to make this discount worthwhile?
And also to raise the amount of people that take that advantage you should offer a sort of tutorial to your customers to follow and buy bitcoins and pay with them. For 5% off a 3D printer I would take an hour of my time to learn it, moving digital currency further.

You need to keep in mind that their are trillions of dollars in circulation making bitcoins supply look like nothing. the small supply with large value is what causes so much change eventually when there are more coins the value will steady. Still will fluctuate up and down but I like that over the just down you see with usd. 
Major thing that steadied the dollar was also merchants so they could have set prices. mechants were the major holders of money so they could steady the price together as it was in their interest. When merchants become more regular we will see more stability in bitcoin, or whatever coin is top dog at that point.
