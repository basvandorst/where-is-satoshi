lol this is ridiculous. People knew about the impending launch of BCH on Coinbase because they made the API publically available a couple days before the announcement. Tipped off me and a whole lot of other people.

How do you cash out a million dollars in bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-05-01 01:12:33
Ok so this transaction happened because of BitFlyer, not Bitcoin ... 
@_date: 2018-05-01 01:11:41
The reason why this transaction happened is because both people used bitFly. So this is really not different from Visa or any other payments processor then. Sorry to be a downer.

Marketing what? 
If you are marketing the idea of crypto then this is very effective.
If you are marketing to get people to actually go out and buy this crypto then it’s not effective.
Different agendas.

This analysis is the equivalent of palm reading, tea leaves or phrenology. You are better of calling a psychic hotline than listening to this guy’s “read” on uncorrelated trends to try and divine the future.

The goal is not to “get people to buy” crypto because simply “buying” a currency has no value (other than for speculators). The goal is to draw attention to the crypto, for which this sign is VERY effective.
If you are a speculator, this sign makes no sense, so I see where you are coming from.

Omg you guys are so annoying

Your a small fish in deep waters. A sucker fish.
