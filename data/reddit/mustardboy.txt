I have some doubts about whether this is legitimate. I will be in Mexico next week and I plan to test it out!

I used this ATM on Tuesday to withdraw some shekels! The process of signing up for an account was time consuming (took me twenty minutes) but I guess now that i have an account the next time I use a Robocoin ATM it should be faster.

Is there a schedule of the route? I would love to give a honk!

I received 21 emails telling me a deposit I made last week was completed.
@_date: 2014-11-18 20:00:13
Haha it was instantly completed last week.

Yes. Also what my balance is in BTC not in USD.

Have you checked out using a Coinbase paper wallet?
They will create a paper wallet for you (which you have access) and send the bitcoins there.

Coins are transferred to a public address. Anyone with the private key to that address can receive the coins.

This is a big deal. Have you tried contacting Bitstamp?

This video should answer most of your questions if you have 20 minutes. It gives a great technical summary of the nuts and bolts.

Every Bitcoin address has a matching private key, which is saved in the wallet file of the person who owns the balance. The private key is mathematically related to the Bitcoin address, and is designed so that the Bitcoin address can be calculated from the private key, but importantly, the same cannot be done in reverse.

This is the general idea. 
Given a private key, a public address is generated. 
You can use your own private key or you can have one generated for you.

A hash function is simply a function which is easy to compute one-way but hard to invert.
Using the hash function anyone can verify if your private key is the correct one but since the hash function effectively cannot be inverted no one can determine what the private key is.
When you setup a bitcoin wallet you are given a public and private key to that wallet.
