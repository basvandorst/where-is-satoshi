And there's a chance that's what you'll be telling people for this one too. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:29:43
It's still a bubble. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 04:52:35


  
Truly, allowing businesses to decide what services they offer is the very opposite of a free market. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:42:57
At that price, transaction fees would be what, about $150? Bitcoin seems like a better currency by the minute! 
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:27:55
Yep, if you wait enough, bitcoin will always go up, its guaranteed. There's no way things could ever go wrong! 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:44:49


  
It's literally a private business, they don't need to offer you their services if they don't want to. They don't want to deal with the massive headache bitcoin represents for them and that's their right. 
  


  
Ironically the free economy is what lets them choose how they do business. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:47:28
Any crypto currency which doesn't have $30 transaction fees and day long wait times is a better one than bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:41:46
The reasons you would put money in a savings account are literally the exact opposite of why you would put money in a hyper volatile commodity like bitcoin. 
  
You would never put money in a savings account to try to turn a profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:31:02
Yeah, I can't imagine why a currency with day long transaction times and $20+ transaction fees might not be worth as much as people claim it is. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:34:30
With the $25+ fees and the hours long wait times you really have those banks quaking in their boots I'm sure.  
  
Bitcoin isn't a currency anymore it's an investment. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:56:50
Requires adoption rate by the vast majority of bitcoin users (good luck with that) and would only increase the transaction rate by 4 fold. Even if it was successfully implemented the currency would still be the dumpster fire it is today. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:38:29
Bitcoin's only value was from its utility as a currency. It currently has roughly no utility whatsoever as a currency because of the insane volatility, transaction fees, and wait times.  
  
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:47:36
Well, we know Bitcoin has value because people think it has value as a currency. We also know Bitcoin is an absolutely horrible currency at the scale its currently at, and basically unusable with long wait times and massive transaction fees. 
  
  
It doesn't take much extra thought to put 2 and 2 together and see that bitcoin's only so expensive right now because people think they can make money from bitcoin, and there's no underlying value of any kind justifying the price. 
  
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:33:27
Except as long as the prices remain this high bitcoin will continue to have transaction fees above $25 and wait times half a day or more long.  
  
The price of bitcoin rising literally makes both of these issues worse. Bitcoin is a failure of a currency at this level, and there is no substance to back up its insane value. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:51:34
Bitcoin will never be usable as a major currency, with its absurd $25+ transaction fees.  
  
The only reason people have bitcoin now is to try to make money off bitcoin, and the greed is palpable. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:59:09
At $100 and $1000 is didn't cost over $20 per transaction. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:20:55
So for those playing at home, using bitcoin requires paying a $20+ fee and waiting half a day. It's hard limited to 3 transactions a second and there is no way to upgrade the source code whatsoever. 
   
The more people that use it, the worse it will get. So, yeah. I have no idea why people got it into their heads that bitcoin was worth more than Tesla.   
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:25:11
So bitcoin is still a useful currency but only for massive amounts of money? 
   
Wow, such an amazing currency that's only viable for use if you're spending thousands of dollars at a time. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:49:13
Pray the exchange doesn't decide to ~~pull their exit scam~~ "get hacked" during that time. 
  
For a currency claiming to be so secure it's amazing how much faith you guys will put into 100% unregulated exchanges with 0% chance of ever recovering your assets in case of fraud.  
  
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:24:57
The dip isn't the problem. The problem is that at the current price and adoption rates, bitcoin is one of the worst currency systems I have heard of in my life.  
  
Bitcoin's value stems entirely from its usefulness as a currency. How useful is a currency that is hard limited to 3 transactions a second, costs +$20 a transaction, and has wait times of nearly a day? 
  
And the more people that adopt bitcoin, the higher the price gets, the worse these problems get. Bitcoin is a failure of a currency at the scale it's currently at and there's no way to fix it. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:27:33


  
Because a currency that costs $20+ to use *per transaction* and has wait times of nearly a day is totally worth 10x more than it is now.  
  
Which, btw, would make the transaction costs $200 per transaction and god only knows what the wait times would be. Lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:55:30
The vast majority of the bitcoin community would need to agree to the switch (hasn't happened) and it would only increase the transaction limit by 4. That's not nearly enough. 
  
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:57:31
That's not true. Bitcoin is not the first bubble to have multiple crashes. 
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:56:16
Uh, why would they ever do that when they could just let the bitcoin owner deal with the hassle of converting the coin into real money?
@_date: 2017-04-03 09:33:04
Ah, sort of like bitcoin.  
  
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:11:00
None of that gives them value. There is no set number of goats you can buy with your bitcoin. It's worth exactly as much as people think it is. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:49:13


  
That's great. That does not give it value, that does not make them worth anything. 
  


  
How is that remotely related to the topic at hand? 
@_date: 2017-04-03 17:10:28
Tell me again what inherent value virtual coins have again? Can you eat it or get value out of it if suddenly everyone else thinks it's worthless? 
@_date: 2017-04-03 19:49:58
No, but vast amounts of bitcoins have been stolen in scams.  
  
Difficulty to counterfeit does not give something value. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:07:27
You're only taxed if you make more than $100,000 a year. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:14:15
People aren't investing in physical currencies with the hope that they'll shoot up in value and make them wealthy. If they were, it would also be a zero sum game, but since actual real currencies are used as, you know, currencies, and not just investment opportunities, the fact investing in them is zero sum doesn't come up much because no one invests in them. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:33:25
Or I could store my cash under my mattress if that's the route I really want to go. But personally I'd rather my money be making at least some sort of non zero interest.

I mean he did say McAfee virus software is utter shit, so he's not always wrong. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 21:24:17
Let's see, should I trust the heavily regulated banks, or the unregulated exchanges that keep stealing everyone's money... hm...
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:54:13


  
You're right that the people charging fees to buy bitcoin are making money from bitcoin. At other peoples expense. 
  


  
Waiting days and spending $30+ per transaction? Yeah that's sure a lot of value.  
   


  
Except stocks are tied to investing in companies. Companies actually use this money to build factories and such to make things. People invest in bitcoin just in the hopes a greater fool will come along and buy bitcoin for more and make their bitcoin worth more. Nothing is getting made. Everyone who cashes out with a billion dollars took that billion from other investors.  
 


  
No, it's still zero sum. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:07:04
By some metrics sure, like nuclear stockpiles or military size.
  
By maternal mortality rates, salary, healthcare, overall standard of living etc, it's definitely better off than most of the world but a long way from the best. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:50:24
Wow, they finally got it down! 
  
Too bad if the volume ever shoots up again it'll skyrocket again. Also, needing to pay $2.65 to make sure you'll get a 10 minute confirmation time is still utterly ridiculous. If I had a credit card that did that to me, I'd cancel the next day. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:04:48
True, since it's crashed it's what, $10 now? Totally reasonable. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:08:14
Start buying shit with it? Good idea! 
  
"Here's my $5 worth of bitcoin... and here's another $20 of bitcoin to cover the transaction fee" 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:36:41
Yeah, but the point is there's no niche here that needs to be filled. There's no service bitcoin offers someone who just wants to buy groceries at a store that debit / credit / cash doesn't already.  
@_date: 2018-02-04 02:04:25
It's a zero sum game. No one is producing anything with bitcoin, the only way to make profit is at someone else's loss. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:09:09
Because normal currencies are so volatile and unstable, meanwhile bitcoin is super stable and immune to massive pump and dumps. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:12:24


I'm unaware of a single popular money transferring service that is as expensive and slow as bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-03 01:37:36
My credit card will automatically exchange it and gives a pretty decent rate. I don't need bitcoin with it's $30 transaction fees and days long wait time.
