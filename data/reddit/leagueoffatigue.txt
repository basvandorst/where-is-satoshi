This. I thought I wanted a relationship because I was lonely, but then I realized I was depressed and avoiding it. So I made changes to my life until I was happy, and I realize now a relationship would just have been another bandaid to cover up all the shit that was keeping me down.
All my friends are dealing with drama, on time constraints, getting calls from their girlfriends or wives, etc. and I could not check my phone for 3 hours and not have to worry about anything. I couldn't be happier to be single and lucky enough to never have accidentally knocked someone up.

Because people on Reddit, for some reason, have this inherent urge to feel right, and if they aren't, they'll just continuously spew bullshit rather than just thinking "oh hey, maybe I was wrong about this thing that doesn't affect me at all in reality".
Just think of all the bitcoin youtube channels making shit up right now. Predictions, analyses, etc. All bullshit, and yet they get thousands of views.

If you're worrying that much, you probably shouldn't be in bitcoin. An investment is money you don't care about losing, and investing in bitcoin is about hodling. 
If you never sell, you'll never lose money on bitcoin. You'll have the same amount of BTC no matter what. Worrying makes no sense if you actually plan on hodling.

This. Exchanges before them have shut down out of nowhere and made off with everyone's money at no risk to themselves. You do not own those bitcoin. Robinhood does not own any bitcoin. If bitcoin explodes, Robinhood can remove the sell option for as long as they want and hold your money hostage, or as I've already said, literally steal all your money.
Not your keys, not your bitcoin. Buy a hardware wallet and never worry again.

No, not talking about an email lol, email data is sold for almost nothing. Everything you do in the actual simulated crypto exchange is recorded as data, that they can use or sell in a variety of ways, whether it be to gather data on which cryptos people are confident in investing in, when and how much they choose to buy/sell, and plenty of other things that many people would be interested in paying good money for.
@_date: 2019-07-21 21:35:35
There's a reason the fees are so high on these you know. An atm like this isn't going to recieve much use, not yet at least, and has zero competition for people looking to quickly convert to fiat, get rid of some fiat, or their first buy.
Factoring in electricity cost, cost of leaving their ATM there, as well as how much it cost to build that machine, they're probably going to be in the red for a while on these, but as adoption comes, they're going to make a killing on bitcoin noobs (at least until competition brings the fee price down).
What it DOES do well is bring attention to bitcoin, puts the word into people's heads, makes them curious, may even start conversations where one person teaches another about it.
@_date: 2019-07-02 03:02:57
Data from actual exchanges from millions of random people with random amounts of income, wealth, and locations \*somewhere\* in the world. That's one type of data.
Simulated crypto gives people $100k at startup to buy as much of anything they want with zero consequence or fucks about what will happen to their "money". That's a very different type of data. Very valuable to someone with similar circumstances of having $100k throwaway money, or a mathematician looking to build a bitcoin prediction algorithm specifically to see if there's a trend in whale purchases or which trash coins are the most popular and will receive pumps from bitcoin jumps. Who knows.
The data is different, but both are valuable in their own way.

As someone who only used Coinbase once before, waiting 12 days to even do anything with btc that I paid for but didn't technically own yet, was extremely stressful.

I had so many interactions like this on my last reddit account, it was basically a meme to get them. Between "trading" btc, apps, websites, transfers, minimum withdrawal exchanges, and other scams, they all just want your money. Almost nobody does anything like this, and if it involves anything of yours, it's too good to be true.
It's the most fun when you just troll them for a while and waste their time. Act stupid, make passive insults, get them as angry as you can before you tell them to shove their head up their ass in a colorful way.

Think of prohibition. People would drink themselves blind, be heavily addicted, and die from alcohol poisoning all the time. Why? Because there was so much stigma around it that nobody would help an alcoholic. 
Think of heroin, cut with fentanyl or whatever other horrifying things people can get mixed into it. Think of meth, made in water bottles in the basements of meth heads. Think of cocaine, cut with anything to add weight and anything cheaper and stronger to give the user a better feeling. This goes for any drug. And these are all drugs done in locked bathrooms, bedrooms, basements, and other places where one can die completely unnoticed or where it'd be difficult to get to that person.
The government can spend the money from the DEA on making pure drugs cut with non-harmful substances that can be sold/used in gov't facilities that offer physical addiction and mental health help. This also means that the stigma around drug use can be reduced or removed, meaning there's a higher chance that someone can seek help without fear of persecution whether it be legally or in family/friend relationships.

Edit2: I said everything CAN be explained by science, not that it currently is explained. We don't know everything about black holes, but we're on our way to that just as we are mapping out the human brain and trying to find what truly makes one "concious". To say something can't be explained by science under any circumstance is full blown ignorance.

He said he should own them in a wallet right after he said he owns 2.5 btc on Robinhood, so I'm assuming he knows all this already, but still good tips.

Many things were impossible long ago, that are possible today. With quantum computerd and AI on their way, neuroscientists will be able to map thousands of brains, human and nonhuman. They'll be able to simulate and "run" them as if they were computers, and they will definitely explain conciousness.

I second this. Buy bitcoin, and run a node.
To explain a little better, it might seem more efficient and fun to mine, but that's because you don't directly pay fot Btc when you mine. You pay for mining equipment, and you pay for electricity to keep that mining equipment running.
It would take a long time to break even on the mining equipment, and even longer when you factor in the extra monthly cost of electricity based on where you live. The bright side is, you can basically use mining equipment as a way to heat your house, but even factoring that in (unless it's super cold where you live and the gas needs to be running 24/7), it'll still take a very long time to break even.

Knowing about how btc works is a steep learning curve. Protecting your btc is easy as owning a hardware wallet and following instructions.
Though with the amount of people using Robinhood &amp; other crypto 'exchanges', protecting btc is pretty hard for the average person seeing as they're basically renting a fake investment in bitcoin that can be stolen from them at any point with no ramifications.
It upsets me how I used to use Robinhood, but now I spend my days hodling btc that I own and trashing exchanges in hopes someone might get a clue and purchase real BTC.

Use coinbase pro. Basically the same website, just looks a bit more intimidating with all the extra features, but a fraction of the fees. My friend spent over $100 in fees when he bought in, that only went to the website rather than into his btc wallet.
Also, if anyone messages you about btc, 99% scam. If any btc leaves your wallet or you have to give anything other than an address for them to send btc to, it's a scam. Protect your BTC by simply not talking about it. Don't mention your current btc amount, don't mention what kind of wallet you use, don't talk about where you hide your wallet or seed phrase, and never leave your seed phrase anywhere someone can get to it. It seems like a lot, but it's really a lack of doing things that keeps your btc safe.

Hey, I was just like you a few months ago. I had my bitcoin on an exchange that "holds" your private key for you (i.e. you don't own any bitcoin, they can remove the buy/sell options at will, and if they close their crypto exchange, you lose all your money and can do nothing about it. It's happened before, it'll happen plenty more times, unless full adoption occurs but I've my doubts). I was scared of hardware wallets because it was like $80 and sounded so difficult to use. But my Ledger is stupid easy to use, walks you through everything, and once it's done (took me \~15 minutes), you can put your coins on it and hide it as you please.
You do need to connect it to the PC, but only when setting it up and transferring in/out of your wallet.

Right? It was the only legal form of drug that lets you destress. Beer definitely was gross until it was the only thing to drink at a music festival, then I got home from work one day and thought, 'man, I just feel like having a cold beer' and it felt rewarding and tasted pretty good.
Now that weed is legal though, getting drunk isn't nearly as fun, especially when I can smoke all night, pass out, and wake up feeling great the next morning (sometimes a little groggy but nothing like a hangover).
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:48:46
You just don't want to listen. I guess ignorance is bliss.
Maybe you weren't there when they've removed the sell option on btc? Think they're going to willingly lose tons of money on paying people their rightful share? Do you know ANYTHING about Robinhood? I highly doubt it, because I've used Robinhood for stocks and crypto for many months, reading almost their entire website and plenty of articles, both positive and negative, before switching my crypto into a real wallet.
There's zero evidence they actually own any btc multiple times, and it's more likely they sell your money as loans to other people at interest rates to make money rather than actually putting any of your money into what you think it does. And if BTC goes too high and people start cashing out, they're probably going to remove the sell button AGAIN and basically wait until it crashes enough to pay everyone back.
I highly recommend you look up "crypto exchange closes" and go ahead and see what shit you're spewing before you go making these arguments.

But I personally believe that people who make videos like you are just  doing anything you can to pull in youtube money.
Here's a tip. Using the word "technical analysis" in crypto is literally a fucking meme, and you aren't going to be taken very seriously. Teaching people things on YouTube has not only been done millions of times, there are thousanda of videos explaining exactly what you do in your video, by people with verifiable credentials (like a masters or PhD) beyond a google spreadsheet.

If one wanted to fight bitcoin while profiting, they'd simply break every uptrend they could by selling at a lesser profit than they'd recieve from a peak.

When I saw the security footage, a grown 35 y/o man swiped it off the table right at that moment and walked into a crowd before I knew what happened. If they didn't follow him on the cams until he got to his class, they'd never have figured out who it was.
Had enough money put into the phone, case, camera, and earbuds wrapped around it to have him charged with grand theft, permanently banned from the school, and an inability to get his money back for that semester or classes. Fuck that loser.

This. No reason to sell all btc into fiat if one can avoid it, but locking in some profits during a run is a smart idea, even if it's returned in filthy fiat.
If it dips, it's probably worth buying back in, if it doesn't dip, treat yo self with that money.

I don't understand how people think anyone has the answer beyond a speculation. The only way someone would know is if they personally know a whale, who found out about bitcoin through libracoin news, and told them they were buying tons of bitcoin. 
Could just be whales being whales. Could be libracoin. Could be tons of people buying because they're seeing bitcoin atms and talk of a second crypto rush.

If a whale invests $30m into bitcoin, the market will spike accordingly, and if he sold immediately, it would return to where it was. The reason this doesn't happen, is because people will buy, or become more interested, as bitcoins goes through its dives and climbs due to whales, thus further increasing the knowledge of, and demand for, bitcoin.
Ofc people will manipulate the market, especially in its infancy, that's going to happen reguardless of which currency one uses. Also, it won't be possible if/when bitcoin becomes a worldwide currency and fiat is no longer useful.

If you're looking for a safe profit and not a real btc investment, Robinhood isn't bad. I used it for stocks until everything started crashing &amp; prompty made a cool $500 before selling and transferring my money back to my bank account.
Definitely a short term profit sort of deal. Not much learning required.

Thanks for explaining, that really puts things in perspective. Feels bad I down downvoted so much, guess my questions are a bit more assertive than I intended.
Not sure how companies can allow their security to be that bad simply due to laziness/negligence though, especially when news of these things happening can pull away stockholders &amp; users simultaneously.
Did the hack affect the money in people's wallets or those who had money stored on the site? Were they reimbursed if it did? I've heard varied things about (FDIC?) insured crypto, but I can't remember if it said it wasn't, sometimes was, or always was, or if it was dependent on which country you live in.

He'd buy bitcoin for $10,800/btc, and sell it for $12,800/btc.
Seems like a lot, but nobody who is knowledgeable about bitcoin would ever sell enough to make him significant amounts of $ unless they're in a tight spot and need cash.

There are plenty of videos, books, etc. to fit your medium of learning. I recommend a hardware wallet (Ledger or Trezor) if you hold more than $300 in bitcoin as that's the point it seems worth having a highly secure method. Some say $1000, but $300 is where it'd really hurt to lose it.
I use a wallet on my phone (DropBit) that the manager of my local coffee shop used to work for as the middleman for my hardware wallet since I'd rather not connect it everytime I want to pick some BTC up.
Also, I use CashApp (fees are rough, but it's very simple and I'm constantly receiving money on there for beer and food runs). If you plan on regularly investing, I recommend coinbase pro. Same concept and company as coinbase, but more options, graphs, information, and super cheap fees.
Feel free to message me with any questions, and don't get scammed. I will repeat that a million times to newcomers to bitcoin, as there are millions of different scams and scam sites looking to take whatever they can from whoever they can. They are heartless, and aren't looking to help.

Obviously. No way to prove it so ofc he's going to say his predictions on a unpredictable currency have been spot on. These fuckin kids want to feel like geniuses cause they drew a meaningless line. What a great "analyst" we have here lmfao
@_date: 2019-09-07 18:26:01
Well there are two options.
Sell it now, and you'll have whatever it's worth now.
Or wait a couple months and see if you can double, triple, quadruple, etc your return, maybe learn more about BTC from the resources in the sidebar.
Or just never sell it, and if it's adopted as a currency in a country (or countries) it could eventually be worth a small fortune, or if it's adopted as a worldwide currency, you could be rich, who knows. If you keep it, definitely learn more, it's actually pretty crazy how BTC works.
A basic explanation of BTC is a virtual currency whose value is defined only by supply and demand, as well as the value of the currency you use (if you ever plan on converting back). We all hope one day everyone will use BTC and we won't have to deal with a gov't printing too much money and essentially ruining the value of our currency. If you look up or have heard about what's happening with the Venezuelan Bolivar, or the Trade War between the US &amp; China, these are reasons why BTC is such a strong idea.
If you use Robinhood or another company that doesn't allow you to transfer coins, you don't own them and they can be stolen at any time. Electrum is a good wallet I've heard of, but I use a hardware wallet to keep my BTC as safe as possible.
Also, be careful of scammers. If anyone messages you about Bitcoin, ignore them, no matter what they say. They want to make it seem like they want to help you, buy your BTC, help you make money off it, etc. Fuck'em. They're scammers. They see a post like yours and start drooling. Websites where they want you to deposit BTC so they can give you more will scam you. Helping someone buy BTC from some weird website? Scam. Once they take your BTC, there's almost nothing you can do about it. Please do your research and don't get scammed :c

At international levels, they use gold (for now). Moving millions of USD to another country with a different currency would be ridiculous and a massive waste of time &amp; manpower, equally as ridiculous as someone bringing that many Euros to the US.

Betting on anything is gambing, everyone who invests in bitcoin is gambling, short term, long term, doesn't matter. Investing more money than you have, such as investing with a credit card or leverage trading, is definitely a level above regular gambling.
The risk is higher, and the damage you can do to your financial situation is magnified. Sure, if you're lucky, you can beat the odds and make out pretty good. Betting what you don't have is just too dangerous, esp when bitcoin is so volatile. If you're betting what you do have, just buy btc and hodl it in a hardware wallet, it's no different and holds much less risk.

Banks don't hold massive amounts of foreign currencies, even central banks don't carry close to large sums. A couple million tops, but they're not going to be ready for a foreign multi-millionaire looking to empty his account. Yes, they do move sums of USD across the border specifically for exchanging one currency to another, but for massive wealth transfers they use gold to avoid having to take extra steps &amp; time.
It'd work, but having $500m USD sent to Germany would mean a bank would have $500m of a foreign currency that they'd need to transfer all or most of into Euros through exchanges since holding that much money in foreign currency wouldn't be very useful for a bank, so they'd need to trade and sell $500m USD for Euros to other banks, businesses, the gov't, and whoever else might want USD. If you send gold, then they have a material that holds value and can be exchanged/sold to a million different places in exchange for the national currency.
Imagine if they held Venezuelan Boulivars for exchange. It'd literally be useless within a couple months, even if they had trillions and trillions of them, which would be an extreme amount of physical volume and weight.

I wasn't talking about you though. It's fun for us to post speculations and predictions, and when they're right it makes them all that much better.
You didn't try to manipulate data to make it seem like you know 100% what's going to happen, or try to make unrelated data seem relevent to an unpredictable currency. You just said it'll happen, it did, and it's beautiful to have witnessed.

And immediately ban anyone who posts a video to some random guy acting like he knows any more about BTC than anyone else on here. "IT'S TOTALLY GONNA GO UP TOMORROW GUYS, LOOK AT THESE GRAPHS! DON'T THEY LOOK SUPER SMART?"
I honestly can't imagine anyone who knows anything about bitcoin actually watches those videos. They're literally predictions based on 0 evidence(they're meaningless), you'd be better off meeting with a gypsy fortune teller in a tent on the outskirts of town.
Not to mention I've never seen one of these videos that wasn't immediately downvoted to oblivion.

So basically, Binance lost like $56m in fiat due to a hack. Isn't this a massive blow to the future of crypto &amp; the massive adoption by larger companies, as well as to the possibility of ever using BTC as a primary form of currency? One day you could wake up and millions of dollars are gone in an instant, and there's no way to get that money back?
&amp; if there's no way to get those bitcoins back, then why even bother trying to track its movement? &amp; if they do find who's responsible, you can only realistically threaten them with jail time if they refuse to return any of it.

Many questions.
Why are exchange apps so disliked here? I've made decent profits on Robinhood through stock trading for what little I put in since I started last year, and liquidated my stocks/invested everything into BTC around the 5k mark.
I've learned a lot about BTC since then, and would rather actually own it rather than go through the exchange, but I'm not sure what's to come because I invested on an exchange app. Will I get hit with huge fees? Do they happen when I buy/sell or does it come during tax season?
Last question, should I leave what I have invested on there, get setup with a hardware wallet, and put separate BTC on there, or would it be a better idea to pull it all and just add everything into my wallet?
