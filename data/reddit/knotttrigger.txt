They both have a 1 so they must be equal and that means whichever is worth more is mo better.
@_date: 2017-01-02 18:49:51
4) Why didn't I back up my shit?!
@_date: 2017-01-07 19:17:27
Quantify "most" and I might bother.
@_date: 2017-01-05 05:34:24
Forget about "normal".  Welcome to Bitcoin Motherfucker.
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:20:15
Back your shit up or you're going to lose it.  Coinbase hasn't lost any coins as best I know.
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:51:07
It's going to fluctuate forever, get used to it or get out.
@_date: 2017-01-07 18:47:38
Cool story
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:53:07
Yea, I checked the charts after and it looks like a bunch of turtles out there. :)

Happy New Years!

Bitfinex has a history of fucking up rallies.
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:14:33
Work should be fun.

@_date: 2017-01-01 19:23:44
I ask that you please do this every time bitcoin increases by $1000 for the rest of your lives.
@_date: 2017-01-04 00:03:36
If it was anyone but you selling them then they would not be worth as much since they are two factor.  As a collector I had no idea these existed in this type of quantity.  Really nice collection you have there. :)
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:11:55
Since you won't spend it now.  Put in what you can afford right now and do that every month.  Even if it is just $10.  You might not feel better right away but after a few months you will start to.
@_date: 2017-01-01 01:59:27
He's going to yell at you for saying that.  You are actually posting a lot of supload links according to your history. :o
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:39:46
It hasn't yet but Bitstamp just did a minute ago and Coinbase buys from them so any second.
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:36:55
The Coinbase mobile app has not hit 1k for me.
@_date: 2017-01-03 00:30:02
I can't wait for all the talk about being able to buy a whole bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-01-04 00:09:35
Thanks for sharing I didn't know that.

Why assume more risk?  You'll be able to respond to market fluctuations swifter if you hold.  Lending it out will lock it up and add risk.
@_date: 2016-12-24 01:42:05
Nope, there is barely any FUD.
@_date: 2016-12-31 17:47:54
I agree it is an issue.  I get pretty frustrated trying to figure out the weight of bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:23:13
I would buy.  I have been around here a while and one thing making me warm inside is the smaller and smaller amounts moving the charts.  I remember the trades being in the thousands and barely moving it and now buys or sells of a hundred are dramatic.  Shits getting real, yo.
@_date: 2016-12-24 00:04:50
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:45:45
I think it's a bad deal but I'm not a financial advisor.

So you think Satoshi Nakamoto is his real name and he never lied about anything.  Got it.
@_date: 2016-12-29 15:32:47
Speculators speculating.
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:03:58


  
What do you base this on?  
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:21:50
It might be a pavlovian response to identifying a crazy person.  Some are compelled to warn others.   
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:35:22
Different people want different things.  We'll have to wait on the question of majority.  It's interesting to think about but bitcoin doesn't need the majority to adopt it to survive.
@_date: 2016-12-23 23:50:25
dats honey

@_date: 2016-12-23 23:52:03
There will plenty of concern trolling about the perceptions of buying .point something and how we should come up with something better or use such and such.
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:51:46
Did Satoshi ever claim to be an individual acting alone?
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:56:08
Yes, thank you, I just looked it up and it appears to be to cover operating the trust.  Whatever that encompasses.  I see no reason to pay a premium to hold a commodity like bitcoin.  This is a storage solution I can handle on my own unlike gold.
@_date: 2016-12-30 20:34:22
It's a preference and you pay for your preference.  You can go alone and assume responsibility with your money and enjoy your perceived benefits or you can trust a third party to afford you certain assurances and most likely pay more for whatever perceived benefits that gives you.  Bitcoin offers the opportunity to exercise preference.
@_date: 2016-12-30 23:29:31
I hope you get to meet Satoshi some day.
@_date: 2016-12-26 17:24:21
Cloud mining is a scam.  In order for you to make a profit with cloud mining, the cloud mining service would have to give away free money and no one is going to do that.  If they had the hashing power to sell you, they would just mine on their own and cut you out.  Just buy bitcoin and hold it if you want bitcoin, you will lose money with cloud mining scams.
@_date: 2016-12-26 21:31:32
Is btc-e under any obligation to report it if they were?
@_date: 2016-12-23 22:38:01
"I'll take the bits right now."
@_date: 2016-12-25 23:54:58
I recommend that when December 10th 2019 comes around, you don't make the same mistake again.  
@_date: 2016-12-30 21:45:55
I believe each share of the trust is backed by .1 bitcoin so look at the chart and decide.
  
@_date: 2016-12-30 23:40:41
As best I can tell they are both the same in structure for the most part.  What is a true etf?  Maybe this is my confusion.
  
The etf is structured to offer in baskets so I imagine the price will reflect the market conditions at time of creation.
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:33:21


@_date: 2016-12-30 00:00:27
I feel like this should exist but I can't find it.
