Nice try banksters... we will just sit here and watch how you will gonna fail. Hilarious.  
Banks can't exist without endless debt so whatever they want to do, they can't use the bitcoin blockchain for endless debt. it's impossible.

A good prankster should make a call to all those 9 banks saying: hey, I'm the CEO of Blockchain and i would like to sell you the technology, can we have a meeting?"

epay.info - 100k satoshi/day easily, pay weekly. You can do more daily but is quite annoying to stay all the time busy with this. They have 20 faucets rotator  
bitcoinaliens.com - good rewards, serious payments  
weekendbitcoin.com - 800/h, serious payments  
bagsatoshi.com - 1280/10min  
moonbit.co.in - works great with XAPO wallet  
fieldbitcoins.com - works great with XAPO wallet  
skybtc.com - 1800/h - payment ok  
bitcoinzebra.com - works great with XAPO wallet  
freebitco.in - works the same for many years 800/h, serious payments. I think is the oldest serious faucet

I know very well how domains work. I have several domains registered in my name with no hidden contact details and never get that junk you said. Even if I would receive some spam, my email server will reject them based on my own rules of anti-spam.  
For a person that want to fight against gov and make a personal webpage without contact details looks like FAKE! I will never believe what is published on a page that doesn't have real contact details, in special when is about donations etc.  
Also there is no mention of how the feds seized their bitcoins: that was my question too. OK USD can seized them in cash or bank accounts, but bitcoins... need the access to the wallet from the owner. So Burt suddenly gave up his access to his whole stash? Hard to believe that.  
This just another fake story made by feds just to discredit bitcoiners and bitcoin in general.

If you raise the prize to 1BTC maybe worth dedicating some time to solve it. But 20mBTC I can do it quickly from some faucets.

Bitcoin can't be used to finance war because is not endless money. You have wars ONLY because banks are giving to military complex companies endless money. When banks are in trouble, they just start a war.

But the question is how they seized bitcoins without having the access to the wallet. Burt give it to them ? he stored them without any password or what?  
If I would have 186BTC I will store them in a wallet encrypted and hidden, not in my house. If they know my wallet address I will not give them the 12 words password because I wouldn't know it anyway (stored in other 12 hidden places for example).  
So what, they will force me to give it to them? No way!  
Makes me think the whole story is fake or even worse... made by FEDs just to scare out of shit you guys.  
Even the domain burtw.com is registered under private contact.... that not smell good for a domain of normal person that doesn't have to hide anything...

the right answer to their question is : play some fucking faucets and you get your money!

Brazil is a huge economy and is a big player. It is one of the most significant players for bitcoin success... Once Brazil is fully entering into the game, will drag all the other south american countries after. Argentina also it stay closer.

Actually you are right. Because at that time fiat will no longer exist.

Is quite tricky this phrase. Maybe we need more details from Andreas.

scam or they promise something that doesn't have (coins), is not working with xapo account
@_date: 2015-09-18 11:14:38
you are right with "get bombed by US gov"...  
Ceausescu in 80s want to have the currency backed by gold... killed  
Saddam want to introduce gold oil trading ... killed  
Ghadaffi want to introduce gold dinar ... killed  
Now Putin want to dump the USD... is on the list  
China is dumping the USD ... some chemical deposits are exploding... is on the list  
And the list go on. Everybody that is dumping the USD, the military complex of US start a war with them... because dumping the USD will take them out of game.

Price really doesn't matter anymore from this point. With a dying fiat is really useless to think that in 5 years from now or whatever time you will sell your coins for tons of fiat, when everybody will use ONLY coins and fiat will be like fax it is today... obsolete.

The banksters will have a video like this in few years, where is presented a bank account/transaction/visa payment like "in old times"... because banks will be history soon.

What's next? Bitcoin will create hurricanes and earthquakes? Oh I forgot, the last volcano eruptions in Mexic it was because of too many miners in the region...

Based on their webpage  (quite nice actually) they are tourism apartments intermediaries for owners in almost all major cities in all continents.  
Is quite nice actually, I will send them my request for bitcoin payment. This can push a bit also AirBnB and others like them...

This is like in the serie "Silicon Valley"...

The guy that wrote that article missed one thing: in few years fiat will no longer exist, so FED also will be out of the game... or at least they will create the FEDCoin :) but nobody will use it.

cool joke worth a +1.  
I wonder how the MSM will take this joke? They will bring back Dorian Nakamoto ?

no. xapo is actually a btc wallet that make the instant exchange of btc into any fiat you pay with that card. you will never have fiat into that visa card. Is just let's say a conversion interface for you btc.  
It's nice that you never need a bank account for fiat. I use it too when there is no other option to pay with btc. I don't keep too many coins into xapo wallet (they have also a mobile wallet and a vault). i can transfer quickly some coins from other wallet and then pay with that visa card to any merchant. Their fees are quite fair until now.

A BBVA ATM never give back change. When you put money you have to put them in an envelope, you are not allowed to put coins and only multiple of 5, 10, 20, 50 bills. So I don't trust you when you say you handled tens of thousands of orders in Spain.

Wow this is good. Is it working also with USD? I mean if I worked for a US company they can pay me in USD and I receive BTC?
