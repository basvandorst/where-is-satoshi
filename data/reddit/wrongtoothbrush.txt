I was just poking around a bit for more information and I came across the concept of a Consortium blockchain, which could be considered partially decentralized. Considering the banks have called themselves a Blockchain Consortium this could be relevant :)
Vitalik Buterin explains the concept in a blog post from early August.

I feel that raising the blocksize is as close to a no brainer as Bitcoin is ever going to get because I still trust Satoshi's vision for scaling. Imagine when something truly controversial (such as merged mining sidechains) needs to be hard forked? Fun around every corner.

The 30 or so banks in the R3 Blockchain Consortium (including Goldman Sachs) are likely considering an Ethereum Framework for each of their own private ledgers, which will all in turn be able to talk to and co-exist with the main Ethereum public blockchain because of its Turing complete nature.

From what I gather it's a way for programmers to create decentralized applications that piggyback on the Ethereum blockchain. Currently you'd need a whole separate blockchain to create a decentralized Facebook for instance.. Then somehow make it worthwhile for a bunch of miners to keep it secure. Let's say you'd then want create a decentralized YouTube, etc. A whole new blockchain would be required. It's not practical. Ethereum will amalgamate all the things for a new decentralized Internet. I think ;)

Hi. Changetip is a centralized service running on a company computer somewhere. That tip money is in a wallet on their server, but I don't own the private key to that wallet. So technically the btc isn't mine and feels like play money when I send it. With a Mycelium wallet you own the private key and nobody in the world can touch that money except for you. It's a powerful feeling.
The transaction confirmations should average near 10 minutes when using your own wallet. I'm not sure about Changetip but I imagine their withdrawal times would try to match it. 
If Myceleum vanished your 12 word password does indeed work for another wallet somewhere. This I know, but I've never looked in to how.
When you restore a wallet it collects both your private and public keys at the same time.
Good luck.
