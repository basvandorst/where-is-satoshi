Money really doesn’t buy you happiness.  Get some money. Buy everything you want. Then tell me how happy you are when your friends and family constantly beg you for money or almost everyone is trying to scam you on a daily basis. That is mentally taxing. There is a reason why wealthy people totally isolate themselves from everyone else. How you gonna hide all that money? It seems like a good problem to have but many rich people are very depressed and suicidal. 
The happiest people I know are poor rice farmers. 
I’m only here watching this show. I have some money but I’m keeping my risk very low to be taken care of for life. I tried making a quick buck off some forex and I lost 5% of my assets. Gambling is not fun for me. For you to be able to have a strong head and ride out these roller coasters, I commend you. I personally would have sold once I doubled my money and probably would have regretted it for life too. This is why I’m staying away. Honestly. Money doesn’t make you happy. You lose everyone.

If the USD fails, the entire world economic structure would probably fail. I’m not saying it’s not possible.  But the world has more faith in the USD than crypto. 
With everyone making bunny, cat, and dog crypto. How can anyone take this seriously ?

Wtf are you talking about dude ? More and more companies are blocking bitcoin ads and no longer accepting bitcoin or crypto for payments. Are you really that delusional???

But were revolutionary bruh. Bitcoin is gonna change the wooorld. It’s gunna be werth a million dollars if we all hodl. We’re gonna all buy lambs and have our own islands while you wish you were us.  
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:30:43
It’s over dude. BTC is and was easily manipulated by Wall Street. No one saw it coming. This is the problem with unregulated markets. No one will ever want bitcoin same as in December. The only way it could skyrocket is demand with the common man. Do you honestly see demand going up or continue to go down ? This will turn back into Silk Road funny money again. Reality sucks but Wall Street dicks fucked this up. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 10:56:54
Uhhh no. Not gonna happen. They learned from history. BTC barely has any history. No one trusts it. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 17:07:54
No you didn’t. Lol you bought bitcoin so you could buy weed or creepy rape porn. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 11:41:50
So tell me, in historical terms, what happened to bitcoin when normies and Wall Street sharks met in December of 2017?. (Hint; it wasn’t pretty ) 
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:03:09
Every asshole knows you will get a lambo and a pizza. Normies. Sheesh 
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:38:03
YES!! The concept will change the way we do business. But banks and governments will come up with their own block chain software. There is nothing proprietary about bitcoin. The market is already flooded with other crypto currency. You should just take your money behind the barn and shoot it. And for those reasons. I’m out.

Better to invest in hookers and coke. Much better time.
