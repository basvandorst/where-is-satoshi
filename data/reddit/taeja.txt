which one did you get? I can't get money together for the better ones, so I was gonna go ahead and get the 2GH miner. Not sure if it'll be worth it in the end though, although I'll probably at least break even.

He made one point in the beginning about it basically being the same thing as gold. After that he went totally off topic and was frankly weird.

The price will likely drop back to around 2.44 or so by tomorrow before you actually receive the dividend. It's not clear you'd make your money back with this strategy. Last week Bitfunder took almost a full 24 hours to pay out the dividend (which I don't really understand since TAT paid out sooner).

Yes, do it. Post the AMA in to help give Bitcoin more exposure.

I use them for ASICM. I received dividends yesterday and have continued to buy and sell without any trouble.

Goddamnit, that's what I was afraid of. I don't have a smartphone! Well.. I do, but it doesn't have service on it, so I guess I'll have to keep it with me if I plan on logging into my bitfunder account away from home!
Thanks for the tip. I appreciate it. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 01:09:31
What do you mean by this? I'm curious. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:03:06
Yes, you can sell your shares for BTC instantly. I'm not sure about dividends going up, but I know the price of the share itself went up after I bought and I made money on that alone. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:47:13
Yeah, just create the account at Mt. Gox and then get verified if they make you do that to add funds (I can't remember!). Then when you're at the BitInstant screen, choose Cash Deposit --&gt; Mt. Gox, and then paste your Mt. Gox account number (looks like MxxxxxxxX) from the top-right of your Mt. Gox home page and you're set.

Why wouldn't he register?
@_date: 2013-05-18 05:13:35
Hmm.. I thought Bitcoin prevents double spends. What do you mean?
@_date: 2013-05-15 16:49:09
I had a hard time understanding what the difference was last night. What is the advantage to having "real" shares as opposed to passthrough shares?

He was really bad at PR for the first few months and seemed to take all the criticism personally. After he was chastised pretty harshly and the guy that runs Bitfunder was brought into the picture to clear things up, he got his shit together. As it stands now (two months later) he's answered all questions to most people's satisfaction. AMC's received all the Avalons they ordered, the machines have been mining for a while now, and dividends have been paid. 
AMC is releasing news today about progress on developing their own 45nm and 28nm chips. Hopefully good news. I imagine it will be. 
Ken seems like the person to be running the business, not necessarily the person to be handling the PR, although he's improved.

You can invest it on Bitfunder or BTCT.co. Granted, 0.002btc won't get you many shares of most companies, but it's a fine place to start and watch your investment grow. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 03:02:48
Yeah I was told I'd receive the dividend the day after the officially pay-out, but I actually received it about 5 hours later. 
@_date: 2013-06-09 22:54:19
Wow, this looks really nice. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 18:51:37
Let's hope so!
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:55:48
"because its not a bubble what we see here, but the energy and hope of a growing number of people"...
I really like that line. That's what I've been feeling/thinking and not knowing how to express :)
@_date: 2013-05-26 19:44:13
How does one go about monetizing a torrent website? If you have a good plan, maybe going 'public' on bitfunder.com is something you should look into?
@_date: 2013-06-02 23:20:45
bitcoinwisdom.com is nice to look at. I keep the tab open basically 24/7.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:11:56
I REALLY wanna see the other symbol used. The one with the horizontal slash! It looks so much better and now's the time to start using it before it becomes mainstream!
Edit: That being said, Great Ad!

I read recently that BFL never had as many orders as people imagined they had (though they were still overwhelmed). If they really have already begun shipping I may go ahead and order me a 5GH/s machine!
@_date: 2013-07-29 05:15:21
Ah. Do you know how WeExchange handles things?
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:04:28
transfer the btc to coinbase and then convert into dollars there.

I have used bitinstant almost every time I've purchased bitcoins. It's never taken me more than 15 minutes to receive the money in my Mt. Gox account if I do a cash deposit at Walmart.
@_date: 2013-05-15 19:01:15
Very easy. Go to [havelockinvestments.com]( and create an account. Then send your bitcoins to your new address at havelock. Then click Browse Funds and find the ASICM passthrough fund where you can buy hundredths of a share at a time and receive dividends every Wednesday or thereabouts. 
@_date: 2013-05-25 21:23:58
Maybe I'm missing something obvious, but I don't see where I'm able to actually send the code to my phone, for example. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 21:46:26
You don't have to have a bank account to get btc. Open up an account at Mt. Gox and use BitInstant's cash-deposit option to send USD straight to your account.

Okay, can you verify your access to this information, please? A picture of a company ID or something similar would be nice. 
@_date: 2013-06-08 03:11:08
The technology is clearly imperfect. This is the reason we here are the only ones with bitcoins. We have the media's attention, though, and once bitcoins are easier to purchase and there is someway for people to be trading bitcoins without waiting 8 hours to download the blockchain, there's not a whole lot of reason why merchants wouldn't pick it up and offer at least a 2.5% discount to people paying in btc. 
@_date: 2013-05-24 00:57:59
Where do you get that information? I'm interested!
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:34:01
I would LOVE to test it out!
@_date: 2013-05-25 21:29:11
Also... while I'm here I want to ask how to enable Replies on bitcointalk. I assume I have to make original posts, probably 5 or so?
@_date: 2013-05-28 03:17:18
This is an awesome idea! 
Also, I don't think you should use commas here: "We would kindly ask you to spend just a few seconds letting us, and the Bitcoin community, know your stance on accepting Bitcoin." 
I think it should probably just read "...us and the Bitcoin community know...". 
Does anyone else know if I'm wrong about that???

check out the threads I linked to. several people break down the numbers there based on various assumptions that you can weigh for yourself based on your risk tolerance, etc.
