Hi, I've taken a look at Circle, but there's no mention of how to buy bitcoin on the front page. Is it possible to do so or do I need to have the app beforehand? 
Trezor looks interesting and quite secure for long term storage of purchased bitcoins, but not sure if it's simple to setup? If she buys a larger amount then I'd say the extra cost for this hardware storage system would be justified. Any tips for setup and using this wallet would be great.

Good idea, it's probably best to be around to help out... since I've seen non-technical people make the easiest of mistakes on their PCs and laptops. I guess when you make a mistake in the bitcoin world it can cost you big time. 
I checked the linked page, thanks. Seems easy to follow the steps for buying and choosing a wallet. We'll read it over together as she was asking how to get bitcoins with her credit card. And I see there's a section precisely using visa/mastercard, which includes three recommended sites (bitstamp, cex, coinbase). I was going to recommend using paypal but it says that it's far more expensive for high volume bitcoin purchases.

Ok I checked out Coinbase, it looks really easy to use. But I saw some reviews saying it's expensive. Perhaps that's not too bad if I get her to try multiple options for a smaller amounts, then decide from there.
And I like that guide for how to use bitcoin and buying your first bits is quite informative. I also noticed coinbase is referred to here too. The "Choose a Wallet" page will be useful to share as I see this as the first most important step. Thanks.

I saw the price was OK (at least if you are buying &gt; 2 bitcoin it would make sense). But not too sure now that you mention the internal battery. How secure would that be if everything goes when the battery dies?

Cool, thanks for the clarification on Circle and the extra advice. Yeah I'd probably stay with her if she going to be buying any bitcoins. Safest option from what you and others are saying. She's not that techy at all.

Hi, I checked those out. It seems to be full of points that we can read into a little further. There's lots of detail on each step. Bookmarked it. I didn't know about coindesk. It's cool that there's now a whole media channel just for bitcoin and digital currency. Thank you :)
