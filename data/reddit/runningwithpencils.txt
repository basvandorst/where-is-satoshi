It's yours for 20k.  He bought that coin at peak and I'd like to sell it for that same value.  It comes with free air freshener.

I really appreciated this conversation, from both sides.  Of particular note was when Andreas kind of lightly played the "i'm being threatened card" and Stephan shirked it off to the number of followers.   Andreas' response to that was sort of just saying "Okay fair play".  It was a neat moment.

How do I run a node with a ledger/trezor?

Yeah I've wanted a couple but for smaller amounts that don't make the device feasible.  In good time, these things will be common and cheap and I'm very much looking forward to it.

Who has the best rates for normal purchases these days?  Coinbase/Cash App/Abra/Something else?  Not needing to trade, just want to make some purchases.

Be that as it may, they've got a lot of guns and I have a few (which I have no interest in using in such a way!).  Bullshit, robbery, thuggery....it is what it is.  I've always been a compliant little shit.

I'm located in the US and am wondering if I use BTC to pay off a loan, would that be a taxable event?
