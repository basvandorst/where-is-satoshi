True to an extent, but it's leaderless in the sense that one of the earliest ppl/developers in Bitcoin, Gavin Anderson, was unable to chose the direction of Bitcoin. Instead ppl voted with their money the team they support, and if ppl stop believing in this development team. Eventually another financial vote would occur. Whereas with ethereum and most other currencies, the founders still play a crucial role in development and lead the projects

From the well known/popular coins I think it's Bitcoin and dogecoin.

Leaderless movement. When ether had a crisis, leadership can call for a fork and most ppl will follow suit.
When silk road got raided and the funds "stolen" (some ppls perspective). There is no leader to fork the chain to return the coins to "rightful" owners.

I turned off overdraft for my bank. Turns out recurring payments will still go through regardless of overdraft status

I think when he said ATM he meant "automated teller machine" aka that thing you put a card into and it spits out money. 
I don't think he meant "at the moment"

You are better off reading the white paper and deciding for yourself. It comes down to what value ppl see in Bitcoin. Both chains want to achieve low fees and decentralization. One is prioritizing decentralization and the other is prioritizing low fees. Which ever is your priority you'll decide is the real Bitcoin.

What sub was this intended for?

Same thing happened to me in 2013. Bought at $700 and it went to $200. I felt bad for a long time but now I wanna go back and stock pile

I put my Bitcoins in ledger and chose segwit chain (as opposed to legacy). Does it matter which I chose in the scenario of a hardfork

Can you elaborate on this point?
Are you saying as the reward for mining goes down, the people willing to mine and thus electricity cost goes down?

But another poster mentioned that electrical use would also downscale with halving rewards.

I didn't say waste because I don't think it is a waste.
But I am trying to weigh the advantages of crypto to the costs (specifically energy cost)

That's good to hear, thanks for your input

This is a great poitn. I looked it up and internet use costs approximately 2% of daily electrical consumption in the U.S. This cost compared to the benefit is insignificant. 
However I am not sure if bitcoin and the internet are comparable in terms of electrical usage at the same scale. I would really hope so and if it is true then all these articles are simply spreading unmerited FUD.
@_date: 2017-07-08 20:07:39
This is a good point.
it would be interesting to compare the energy demand of all the banks compared to bitcoins operating at that same scale. 
There is also the fact that banks demand significantly more manpower which isn't directly related to electricity, but should be considered when comparing resource used vs service provided. 
Thanks for your input.

Forgetting the money aspect I was wondering what bitcoin technology offers that ethereum doesn't.
