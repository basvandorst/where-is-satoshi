More than half the people i mention bitcoin to as not a single clue of what I'm talking about - at all.
"Is that like farmville money?"

You deserve props for having the balls to admit to this. Thanks for the laughs.

Yep. Sorry the joke got lost on people.

You realize you did that the wrong way, right?

I usually just counter argue by asking people what they think physical money is used for.
My nations national bank argued against removing our unused highest valued bill because it would cause the currency to no longer be used for illegal drug transactions which would hurt the currency overall to the degree of billions in lost value.

I find it especially difficult to believe they can know something is 100% secure when they didn't even design the payment system themselves. It's using opencart.com a free open source system. They just edited the powered by tag with their cool "Design by Anonymous" message.

Care to explain the adult friend finder ad then?

Thats probably whats going on here (or what the goal is anyway). I was just trying to explain the concept of insider trading.
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:06:13
Any idea when the site will be coming back up?

Insider pretty much means someone has information from the inside of a business or institution of some sort which may affect the price of bitcoin.
Perhaps the person who sent the SMS knows a bank is going to invest heavily in bitcoin or he knows the government is going to start accepting bitcoin as tax payment. He would then know the price is going up as soon as this event happens and he then makes moves in the market to either buy or sell before the event.
Say if you knew the 2008 financial crack was about to happen and shorted stocks right before it did, that could be insider trading.
