They're created with a lot of caution with a view to maintaining the economy if that's what you mean.
@_date: 2019-07-28 10:43:25
They officially decoupled from the USD last October.
@_date: 2019-07-16 23:27:49
Like Tether?
@_date: 2019-07-17 01:38:04
Tether isn't backed by anything. 
The USD is backed by the US economy, unlike bitcoin.

Guarantee this will be downvoted but the value of dollars isn't really based on thin air. They are very valuable because of their utility. Dollars are used as the base currency of the world. They have a global reach of recognition. The dollar is stable. The largest financial transactions in the world happen in dollars, so there is a degree of security and peace of mind build into the dollar payment infrastructure - which is stupendously large. The US government would do everything in its considerable power to keep these conditions in place and keep the dollar number one. None of these things applies to bitcoin.

who gets the tax?

Large buys require equally large sells. So they would have to eat up the whole order book, and spend their own extensive fortune buying bitcoin for 1k more than it's worth. Not just one bitcoin, but TONS of them. Good deal, right?
And this would only happen on one exchange. Other orders on other exchanges would correct the price without any kind of price deviation. 
Put yourself in the position of a whale. Think about the steps you would have to take to 'manipulate' a price up or down. Please explain the details because I think once you try to, you'll realize it's not possible.

Do the miners set the fees? There is no way they can keep their whole operations running on 5c / Tx. Would Txs become more expensive?
@_date: 2019-06-03 17:51:52
Yeah, 'good' as a metaphor for 'terrible'

Dreadful time to buy

That chart looked very different a few weeks ago.

It's decentralized money. 
All other forms of money in the modern world require a central authority. In fact, they require one to govern the amount of money in circulation (usually the central bank), and then they require other authorities to track who holds how much (regular banks, like where you keep your account).
Bitcoin is different because both its supply and the who-holds-how-much problem are taken care of in its design. So, there is no need for any banks. Try to imagine money without banking.
With Bitcoin, you hold your own wealth. Nobody keeps it for you, nobody tells you what you're allowed to spend it on, where you can send it, or limits your withdrawals. Your bank can't fail if there is an economic collapse because there are no banks involved.
In fact, since you are 5 years old, you are not even allowed to have a bank account. But you are allowed to have a Bitcoin address, because there are no banks controlling your bitcoin. 
How is it possible to have money without banking? Well, it's through an elegant technical design that is widely referred to as a blockchain. [technical part here -&gt;] A record of every bitcoin transaction ever is distributed and stored across a network of computers. Anybody who wants to can be part of that network by downloading the Bitcoin software and keeping this record active. As an incentive for helping process new transactions, they even get a small fee. This is called 'mining', and it's how new Bitcoins are generated.
That is pretty much all you need to know.

Why isn't the kid getting any older? WHY??
@_date: 2019-06-03 23:15:44
How does it effect the market price?
@_date: 2019-06-02 15:06:28
Okay, give a detailed explanation of how it's done. You have 100 million dollars. Make the price move.
@_date: 2019-06-03 12:17:34


If you bought and held yesterday, you'd already be down about $400 per bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:10:56
If you can't do the time...

That says more about Lightning than it does about either of you.

ETH to USD is the value of 1 Ether coin in USD.
BTC to USD is the value of 1 Bitcoin coin in USD.
ETH to BTC is the value of 1 Ether coin in BTC.
If you bought ETH with USD, then it doesn't matter what the price of Bitcoin is. Although generally, they follow each other in a trend. So if the price of Bitcoin is relatively high then the price of ETH will be relatively high, too.
The price of ETH in BTC does also fluctuate over time, but not as much, since they generally trend together. 
Some alts might be over hyped or even outright scams, but that doesn't mean you can't make money from them. 
USD is also a good, stable place to put your money if you aren't sure what to do next.
@_date: 2019-06-03 20:24:56
OK, show the evidence or describe how it works. 


Because I'm tired of this mythology. It doesn't even make sense. You claim to have been around bitcoin a long time and know a lot about it. OK, well you just told me that you think a TRANSACTION changed the PRICE. And you have no idea how.
So why would you think it would? Did you even stop to ask yourself this question? This 'whales change the price' myth is part of the bitcoin narrative that you are right, has been around forever, but it is clearly false. It's not even logically coherent. 
Prices do swing up and down in speculative markets. This is a global market, that interacts with every currency. There are bots. Lots of things going on that can cause volatile movement. 
Stop propagating this nonsense, since you have nothing to back it up.
@_date: 2019-06-02 14:50:47
@_date: 2019-06-23 19:10:27
It's not a storage if it's not stable. Up or down.
@_date: 2019-06-02 19:22:45
The price is volatile because almost everyone in the market is a speculator. Not because of whales making terrible deals with their own money.
This idea of a few shadowy wealthy people 'controlling' the price of Bitcoin has to die. It is superstitious nonsense. Take two seconds and think about it for yourself. 
As for the wet ground, have you ever heard of dew? Sprinklers? Spills? Springs? Thanks for proving my point.

With my own money? Why would I do that??
@_date: 2019-06-04 12:39:59
Why not sell at the top and buy back at the bottom?
@_date: 2019-06-23 16:50:07
How is it a safe store of value if it's volatile and the value of your coins keeps changing? Don't just downvote me. Give a reasonable answer. I'm here because I love bitcoin but don't buy the store of value argument.
@_date: 2019-06-03 13:25:12
It's a fact.
@_date: 2019-06-03 15:41:08
Link it. I can't wait to see how a single transaction 'causes' a spike in the price.
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:07:46
I'll take the bet. What are the stakes?

They're criminals once they commit a crime, whether or not they're caught. If you don't agree, PM me your address and I'll come rob your house.

OK, show the stats.
It makes sense that for every 'loser' in a trade, there is a 'winner' on the other side.
Whales can't move the price. Why does everybody think they can do this? Do you realize how unprofitable &amp; irrational it is to buy or sell a whole book on just one exchange? 
Explain in detail how you think whales can set the price of bitcoin. This is religion-level superstition.
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:52:04
Why do you think this?
@_date: 2019-06-02 12:10:11
Only 50% of traders could ever fail, because they are trading with someone who got the other side of the deal. 
@_date: 2019-06-02 23:41:08
Well firstly, I don't have to explain it. You're the one theorizing. You don't even know how this 'planned execution' would take place. Even if I gave you 100 million, you wouldn't know how to do it. 
Because it is not possible.
Since you tried to move the burden of proof onto me, I already gave you the answer. 90% of the market participants are speculative, and it feeds into every currency in the world. It's a massive global, market built only on hype, with plenty of modern automated trading. The hype factor alone makes it very volatile. 
Assuming that the price won't move just because it has moved 'sideways for weeks' (btc price doesn't really do that tbh) is an absurd fallacy. 
Just stop. There are no whales manipulating the prices. Without evidence, statistics or even a well-grounded idea of how it would work, you should stop propogating this nonsense SUPERSTITION.

You do KYC when you interact with fiat currencies. That system needs to know who you are, or they risk massive consequences, including fraud and regulatory penalties.

No, I was around. People thought computers were for a nerdy minority.
@_date: 2019-04-30 06:23:38
There's no rights violation involved - some expression of your identity is required to participate in the system. 
If the existing banking system could have anonymous participants, everybody would be laundering and defrauding the banks and each other, with no accountability. 
If you don't want to show people who you are, just don't use fiat money. 
KYC as a rights violation lol.
What do you think rights are??
