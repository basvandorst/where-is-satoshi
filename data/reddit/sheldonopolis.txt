you are absolutely right. in fact, i see that with a lot of "as good as cash" solutions, like paysafecards. 
last time when i bought one the guy behind the desk said "sorry, you have enough today, cant give you a second card" (bought one for 30 euros and was about to get another 15 or so) and he told me that for a 100 euro card he needs to make a copy of my id. 
the gov loves to keep track of everything we are doing and if they could, theyd do it with cash too. (they probably do to some extend, since technically they are able to monitor which serial numbers you have withdrawn from the atm.)

i think they were just making fun of the idea of a physical bitcoin atm when there is almost zero real world acceptance for it, which i tend to agree to.
the whole id nazi stuff (palm print, srsly?) is more to clearly link the btc to a real name without any doubt, so peoples transactions can be tracked. money laundering through cash back sounds more like a third class priority.

its a nice propaganda slogan but within the last years it became more and more apparent that it is actually less of a practical currency because of those huge dynamics. this is a big deal because this way nobody wants to use bitcoin for something else than black markets and speculation.
a cryptoanarchist form of decentralized high frequency trading sounds NOT like much of any money paradigm is gonna be changed anytime soon.
