“Hodl” mentality is silly. Sell high, buy low.

I’ll give it a miss and take the hit.

A dip perhaps but not really a crash unless FUD kicks in on a massive scale and people panic sell, the market cap is so large now that the bitcoin price is fairly difficult to manipulate like that.

Weird post, your analyst is mostly bullshit anyway so there was no "signal" in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:20:26
Seems like a scam, pay $17,000 up front ok then what world are you from?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:49:05
Lambo’s for you, and you, and you, and you!

If you’re going to make a post like this at least know what you are talking about. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 10:31:44
Buying then and resisting the urge to sell are two completely different things.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:36:10
If in for the long term then absolutely, just don’t if/when it dips below the price you paid.

How did that work out for you? ;)
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:08:34
Thank you to the newcomers that sold at the smallest loss. Allowed me to buy at a discounted rate. Seriously, it’s an investment, not a savings account.

Being pumped, I feel sorry for the people that will panic sell  once it’s dumped and play right into their hands. At which point they’ll pump it again.

The lipstick is off putting and weird.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:14:18
Agreed and it’s almost all of the UK media that are especially negative. Wouldn’t expect anything less. Idiots.

Each to their own, I think it looks awesome.

You’re crazy if you sell BTC for BCH right now, BTC is on the rise and you missed the boat for a quick gain on BCH - it’s being dumped right now.
@_date: 2017-11-20 16:54:46
Do you need the money? If so sell, otherwise don’t.
@_date: 2017-11-22 01:34:44
So I lost about $1000 by sending bch to a Segwit btc address with shapeshift. They say they cannot recover it, any chance you can?
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:49:37
You should probably see someone about that pent up aggression you have, seriously.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:38:52
Only difference now is a competitor, interested to see how it pans out.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:23:17
Now is pretty much a great time to buy!
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:36:48
That's can be dangerous, it might not dip and could quite possibly head a lot higher today in which case the dip will be the current ATH. Just buy and forget :)
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:38:58
What about if you sold at 16k? Shoutout to you! 
@_date: 2018-11-22 11:09:40
Your image doesn't support your arguement, you can't say well "look at the thread!" - you linked the image. He clearly sold for 10k, not bought. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:07:11
Yes, and probably a Ledger Nano S.
