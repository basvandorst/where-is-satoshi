One of these guys will be right tho. Like the countless animals predicting soccer world cup outcomes - one year an octopus got them all right.

Some guys kept calling me to join their CFD trading platform. Before we got started they were asking how much money I want to earn, that there's some news coming "tomorrow" that will guarantee massive returns etc. I told them I'll think about it and they sent me an e-mail incase I'm ready. The signature on that e-mail said 83% of people loose money. 
They kept calling and I didn't answer. Then one time I answered (they were calling from local numbers and I was expecting a call). I confronted them about that 83% thing and they were like: "no no no you see we'll give you a personal mentor who will teach you, he will be inclined to help since he will earn commissions etc, you can't loose". At that point I started to fool around with them and entered random CC info on their site and acting stupid not knowing what's wrong. All in all I wasted a good couple hours of their call time and maybe saved someone poor guy from them. 
Last call ended in them shouting at me, that I don't understand how banks work and if they weren't a legit company they'd drain my CC a long time ago.

Is it safe/cheap for tourists? 7usd a big mac meal is still on par with "prospering" north-eastern european fast food prices, how about the rest of touristy costs?

Hey. So if I have my seed phrases written down after them being generated and let's say I never enter them anywhere again and no one ever lays eyes on them, my wallet is safe forever? If not then what steps does one have to take to get access to my wallet, assuming they never see my seed phrase? (Let's not bring extremes like kidnapping and torture in to this just yet)
Edit. And thanks for the info, I'm still a beginner.

This sounds just like the guy from about a month ago that rambled about his lost wallet and that he remembered just part of his passphrase or somethingit, offered rewards for recovery. Different issue but sounds the same. People keep telling him he's mistaken or missing something but he sticks to his narrative.
