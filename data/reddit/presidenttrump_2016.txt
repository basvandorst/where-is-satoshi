As an individual no, but for businesses yes. There are limits on the number of free deposits and the amount of cash you can deposit.
If you should up at the bank 30 times a month with 2000 in small bills, that costs the bank money to handle.

Most people don't realize how costly cash can be for a business. You have to store it, count it, track it, transport it and pay the bank a fee to accept it.
It makes thing a bit easier to just go card only.

The main difference is ease of use. Most criminals are idiots. They will screw up when it comes to anonymous bitcoin transactions for more than anonymous cash transactions.

But with an  ETF, you can use leverage! You are going to struggle getting a 3x leveraged bitcoin purchase.

The big issue: If an employee transfers half the bitcoins to his personal wallet and runs off, what is the SEC supposed to do about it?
If you try that with normal ETFs, they can freeze your bank account and have the bank return the money.

Ridiculed, the violently opposed, then accepted.

We can definitely still tax. We will just have to move to regressive taxes like property and sales taxes.
The rich will get a big tax cut from this at least.

about that...

Sounds like Trump

Great, means the US will have another large wave of illegal immigrants.

The risk probably is overstated. I doubt Coinbase even looks at your account unless its doing large transactions regularly.

Most likely they look at volume. If your Coinbase account is doing a ton of transfers to 1 account and that 1 account just gambles, then they ban.
