Are these secure/accurate? For example, if I were to sell something for Bitcoin, I would have to keep checking on one of these sites until the transaction clears? 
What about sending BTC to another address, how would that be done?

If you're concerned set a limit/stop price on gdax.

That is an option in the future, I may get an encrypted flash drive first.

What about the other way around? How do I send Bitcoins to another address?

Couldn't they just transfer the btc to another wallet and have clean BTC?

if you are really concerned, send a small amount of BTC to it first.

What about for a p2p transaction? Say if I sell a sweater to my friend for Bitcoin.

Can you explain how to do this? Tried googling with little success. Is this something I could run on my computer? Or do I need special hardware to do so?

Wouldn't the trillions of dollars be due to inflation? What would the problem be if we scaled down every payment/purchase/price 10 or 20% whatever it needs to be to accommodate bitcoin market cap

That's the same with other retailers. Newegg takes the same risk

VPN and set up a throttled connection?
