Yeah no. Lightning Network requires increased block size. This is mentioned in the LN whitepaper itself.

It is RIDICULOUS and crippling not using a short term fix while a long term solution is developed. And no, 8MB blocks does not lead to centralization. Block would have to be MUCH bigger to limit the ability of running a node to only datacenters.

Yeah, $35 fees and increasing is definitely not a problem. /s. Currently a massive amount of bitcoin users can't even use the coin because they don't have enough funds to pay the fees. And I'm not talking people with only $35 in BTC, I'm talking people with more BTC but with many inputs.
Segwit won't help, adoption rate is minimal, Bitcoin Core wallet is irrelevant, people that "want" segwit don't switch to it when they find that they have to transfer their funds to a segwit address, and this costs them maybe hundreds of dollars. Even if everyone adopted segwite, it wouldn't be enough since it "effectively" increases blocksize to just 1.7MB.
Hearing"Segwit effectively is a blocksize increase" is funny to me because it reminds me of how people got deluded into thinking that segwit was a magic switch that would magically lower the fees to nothing when the switch was flipped. Instead, fees are now 5 times what they were when segwit was introduced.
Hardforks isn't a "relatively drastic thing to do". Important coins do it all the time with absolutely no problem. Ethereum, Bitcoin in the past, even Bitcoin Cash did a hardfork like a month ago with absolutely no problem. If people hadn't been brainwashed that increasing block size is evil, hardforking Bitcoin would be absolutely smooth.

Bitcoin has historically had &gt;85% of market cap dominance. It has this year massively dropped, in fact, in the last 3 days it has dropped from 55% to 44%. [This is a fact]( It is clear that Bitcoin is each day less relevant, and that's no surprise. 
I don't know why you mention BCH. BTC and BCH aren't the only two cryptocurrencies out there.

Well yes, the people that want to use the currency in a peer to peer fashion (like basically any cryptocurrency today including bitcoin).
Not everyone will like the idea of having to sign up for a channel in a hub, which will probably be under AML/KYC rules, and for which you'll have to pay a fee to create.

It isn't just Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash. Considering how Bitcoin's Market Cap dominance is RAPIDLY dropping, it seems like a lot of people don't agree with Bitcoin's block size.
