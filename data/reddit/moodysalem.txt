Credit cards are probably not going away anytime soon even if we see mass adoption of cryptos. Banks will probably not fare as well since you don’t *need* someone to hold your money like you do today.

I took the test and three weeks later I emailed them about the results and it turns out it didn't hit HR's inbox.

They're not banks though, they're exchanges. You can go meet someone who has a lot of bitcoin and buy it in person if you want. The exchange just facilitates that transfer.

OK I'll bite. How is Ethereum centralized? It's mined exactly like bitcoin with one difference being Ethereum is harder to ASIC mine

Vitalik leads development but the miners control what version of the software is run and the miners are going to follow the price. Ethereum is very much a community project.
Light geth nodes (that don't sync the chain) can run on raspberry pis.

Why would you spend crypto if you’re trying to convert dollars into crypto? Spending dollars is the same exact thing as spending crypto and then immediately buying crypto. That’s why I don’t care that people are holding it instead of using it as a currency today.

In the case of ether it has intrinsic value in a vacuum in its ability to pay for deployment and execution of smart contracts. Besides that, I would prefer to spend crypto when buying high value items in person rather than carrying a large amount of money.

Couldn't you build a coin pegged to BTC on ethereum? At which point I don't understand why you would need RSK at all.

DNS entries are always cached for some TTL. The servers are up and that's what you're hitting. Eventually you'll hit the seizure page when your DNS cache expires.
