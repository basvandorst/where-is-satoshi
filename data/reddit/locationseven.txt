Ok understood but these analogies are not related to fungibility. Fungibility is not about volatility or age of a coin, please read again my post.

1 - gambling is prohibited in Korea so trading cryptos just feels like gambling for many Koreans
2 - Koreans like new technology
3 - After China banned exchanges many Chinese moved to Korean exchanges
4 - it’s hard to move more than 50K USD out of Korea, but with cryptos you can do that easily

Are you being sarcastic? 
If not, I really do not get your analogies, care to explain more?

In the world I envision governments are decentralised too, so we would not need to worry about trusting or not a centralised power.
Think about a system in which you decide how much taxes you want to pay and based on that you would receive different kind of social services.
For example, think if you could decide to give only 15% of your salary, and if you could decide that the amount you give in taxes should go 30% for education, 40% to healthcare, and 30% to environment. 
Then according to how much you give and how you allocate your taxes, you will be offered certain kind of services, for example your children will be assigned to certain schools, or you will receive certain kind of health services for free. If you do not use those services you are refunded your taxes, if you need more services than you need then you would pay an additional sum.
Everything regulated by smart contracts.
This  would be a fair system, and it would be possible thanks to traceability of money. You know where your taxes are going, and you know what they are used for.

Nice video and explanation but I do not agree with the conclusion that “we need anonymity to protect the innocents from governments and corporations”.
I think the innocents and the non-criminals should be the governments and corporations.
Traceability of money allows governments to charge taxes and monitor illegal activities, and at the same time allows citizens to monitor how money collected from taxes is spent by the governments.
We should not foster a world split in innocents vs criminals, or bad governments vs oppressed citizens.

Totally agree.
Those who can’t keep grammar tight in place are loosers

It would also be nice if you could explain why and what is your view of fungibility in Monero vs Bitcoin. Thank you.

Thanks for uploading this!
So basically what could have happened is:
- somebody knew about BCH listing time on Gdax and started buying large quantities of BCH as soon as they opened trading, to pump the price and discourage other people to dump their BCH.
- After few minutes Coinbase froze the trading for obvious manipulation.

The price behaviour you are describing applies to new cryptos.
The behaviour of FORKED cryptos is usually that they are dumped as soon as they enter the market.
Regarding Coinbase it is definitely weird what they did, first they start trading going against what they announced and then they halt trading few minutes after. I am curious to hear what they have to say.

It says that the Korean prime minister said cryptos are highly speculative and many people  specially young ones are becoming “addicted” for short term earnings, and at the same time there are risks of frauds and illegal activities, so he suggests finance and justice ministers to keep carrying out detailed analysis on these issues cause if they don’t do anything the issues may become bigger.
Author of the article thinks this suggests more regulations coming.
About taxation, finance minister said they are considering taxation on capital gain but it hasn’t progressed enough to be implemented in next year reform.
