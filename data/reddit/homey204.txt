lol.  i assumed this thread some some girl spazzing out over nothing.  then i read her post,
"I walk in and a group of people are already sitting at a long table. I say hi and hover for a second, determining where to sit. Entirely uninvited, and before I even have a chance to react, one guy proceeds to grab me by the waist and pull me into an awkward, grope-y side hug next to him on the bench. To reiterate, I’ve never met this man in my life. I try giving him the benefit of the doubt and make some quip about his being a friendly sort, but it gets uncomfortable pretty quickly when he puts his hand on my leg and leaves it there until I squirm uncomfortably. "
there is no benefit of the doubt here.  no one should put their hands around your waist.  the next time that happens immediately tell them to not touch you.

BTCapital14, do you have some capital and time to invest? Maybe we can work together.

america is the leader in bitcoins.  if you are from another country how about just saying you care and people from your country care also, instead of lashing out.  i mean, i just re-read the text above and didnt even see anything american-centric.
hold on, let me add a gratiutious insult... lol europe.

yup.  i have an android now.  i wanted an iphone, and i still think an iphone is better.  but i just hate how itunes is not available to linux, and i cant easily put music on or off the iphone without using there software.  so i stay away from apple.

this guy preet bharara is a real piece of shit.  he is the same guy who took down poker in the USA, he ended the FTP ponzai scheme but didnt put any of the criminals in jail; in fact, the FTP ponzi kings are still living in mansions.  the users have still not been refunded their money.  
looks like its time for him to advance his career by attacking more small time players

how do you know that? what is the law that requires a million dollar fee?
your intuition is right, i dont have "multiple millions of dollars" to pay in govt. fees

i'll try to learn some more of the democrat socialist teachings of this age.  thanks for helping my spiritual growth.

I don't know if its the way to go, just that it's a way to go.  A good thing about ATMs is that it should be scalable, so if one goes well then a person could put down ten more real fast, then put down another one hudred... It is also good cause it should be a relatively low maintence investment once it gets set up... And I saw the numbers the Vancouver ATM posted and it looked wildly profitable, and that was even after the first week when novelty usage may have worn off.  
So to me, I see low work, high scalability, low/medium(?) risk, potentially huge reward.  The downside is figuring out the laws and buearocracy which I hate.  Send me an email to clambunny if you are interested.

something which allows businesses to earn bitcoins, and then hold on to them, instead of immediately dumping bitcoins through bitpay.

i see where you are coming from, but IMO bitcoin is both a currency and a commodity.  it shares property of the dollar and of gold.  so i think bitcoin can get a high valuation

its good that you agree that the guy's behaviour was bang out of order.
but why do you assume i am assume bad things about the girl because im sexist?
maybe its just because i think most people are idiots.  if some analagous post were made by a guy id think he was doing something dumb too.

nothing in particular, im not an expert on the subject but the interface is more intuitive to me, seems less buggy in my experience, and the touch screen has been more reliable in my experience

this is insane.  government uses insane regulations to prevent people from opening up small business bitcoin atm's and instead uses their own personal, already in place, monopoly to cash in on other peoples work.  lol.
@_date: 2014-02-02 04:39:52
yes.  i think freedom is a good idea.

its not a cliche.  that speech is too awesome to be called such.

*individual liberty* versus being *forced to work in team x that someone decides for you*?
@_date: 2014-01-27 05:16:02
that isnt necessarily true.  i assumed the same thing about the bitcoin atm in toronto, but if their reports are to be believed usage has stayed quite high

"stay home until they learn the basics of communicating."  lol.  so cool such an idiotic sentence gets 29 upvotes.
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:47:58
not really.  if you want to disappear you can just convert to litecoin, open up a new bitcoin wallet, and receive there.

ignorant comment.  ron paul is smart and has principles.  if you've seen him talk his strong point is not demagoguery, rhetoric, or playing to the media.  seems highly unlikely to me he made up soundsbites on purpose to say something controversial about bitcoin.  i mean, what sense does that make?
@_date: 2013-12-05 17:45:38
god i hate this asshole.
