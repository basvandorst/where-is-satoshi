It's theft unless it's A) Voluntary and B) you get to decide what happens with the money, which ties into it being voluntary.
I don't care what they say it's for or if they even uphold that "promise". If it's not voluntary then it's theft.
If this was actually the case then the people would have true control over the government because they could simply choose to stop funding whatever they don't like. Don't like what the military is up to? Stop voluntarily contributing to it then. This is the only way it'd be actually "fair" and you'd be actually "free".

I'd talk about it if somebody mentioned it or asked about it but I don't go out of my way to discuss it. Not only do I like to keep what I'm holding private but sometimes you get put in a spot where people try to get you to "defend" it and that's really not worth your time. People basically want you to think for them and convince them to buy it rather than putting forward some effort towards learning about it on their own.

I don't really care about the misinformation and drama personally. Nothing you can do aside from pointing it out as it pops up (assuming you recognize it to be false). Everything now a days is polluted with misinformation and self-interested propaganda aimed at manipulating you in some way so it'd be silly to expect crypto to be any different in that regard. At the end of the day blockchain will either prove its value to the world via real-world application or it won't. It's really just a question of which you think is going to happen.

They do it to give themselves room since BTC is volatile. Similar to how ATMs are often horrendous prices but those are far worse than coinbase due to greed and probably being less efficient.

This is how I feel. I don't try to push crypto on people at all. In fact, I don't even let people know I'm involved in the space most of the time despite it being a significant part of my life (job included). If somebody expresses interest or asks I'd discuss it but I try to avoid being "that guy" who's always yapping about "magic internet money".

My best trades came from just forgetting. Not checking the price, not thinking about the investment, just accepting the potential loss and forgetting all about it. Watching all these price swings just gives you unnecessary anxiety and makes you second guess yourself. 
If you're not able to forget and worry about potential losses daily then you need to consider investing less. You should be 100% capable of eating a complete loss on your investment if you had to. Obviously in most scenarios it would hurt but it's important it's not going to destroy your life if it actually happened.
@_date: 2019-09-20 18:35:27
Some people value their privacy and don't like 3rd parties butting their nose into every little thing they do. For an exchange you could argue KYC is justifiable but for random online purchases and what not it's just silly. 
IMO all of these excessive regulations are only trying to choke crypto. They want it to be such a bitch to use, with so many downsides, that you go crawling back to their bankster fiat garbage.

Well for crimes like that there's a statute of limitations so it's not the same as murder. As long as you stayed unidentified long enough they wouldn't be able to charge you even if you confessed. But yes I'd wager anybody involved in this sort of shit is extremely careful/paranoid. The ones that aren't are probably the ones you see pop up in bust articles lol.
@_date: 2019-09-20 17:37:49
It's a wallet which also offers payment processing for online merchants and stuff. It was pretty great but now they demand KYC for transactions over certain values. I'm sure they didn't want this to happen either but their hands are tied more or less. People will just move to a new service that's not forced to KYC.

LTC is still garbage imho. Profitable garbage, like bitconnect was for some, but better to invest intelligently than gamble recklessly like an idiot. I'm mind blown by how many scams and garbage projects still manage to survive or even thrive these days.
@_date: 2019-09-09 02:34:42
Exactly. Ostensibly they're "failures" but in terms of the real purposes they're a smashing success. It's broken by design because if there's no "problems" to solve they're not able to offer you their perpetual band-aid solutions (which aim to benefit them, not actually fix the "problem").

Their power comes from a pretty wide gap in knowledge actually. Control over the monetary system is just an important piece of the puzzle. It's literally the same dynamic of the slave owning days in the US. You wouldn't want your slave being educated at any capacity beyond learning to work the fields because an educated slave isn't a slave for long. We're all arrogant morons though so we like to consider ourselves educated.
Their evil system is Government itself. No group can rightfully possess rights and freedoms others are not naturally afforded. It doesn't matter of 99% of the population thinks it's the case, it doesn't turn the sky from blue to black. Cryptocurrency is a step in the right direction if the spirit it was birthed in isn't forgotten but at the end of the day it's nothing more than a step. We've still got a long way to go even if it does grow to it's full potential.

Saying "*never*" is kind of silly. This issue is being worked on so, unless you're proposing it's impossible to address, then it'd be more accurate to say "not any time soon" or "not in the near future". I personally think we're getting closer to idiot proof every year. In the interim greed will motivate people to learn more than they should "have to" to navigate the space successfully. In fact, greed is probably responsible for everybody here having the drive and commitment to learn anything about cryptocurrency, much less master the processes of using dapps, trading, safe guarding funds, etc.

At the level you're talking about enriching themselves isn't the end game. Owning you and controlling everything you do is the end game. Want to buy a shitcoin? Cool just go ahead and send in a bunch of identification documents so the government can more easily track your activies. Earned some money from working, which they taxed you on, then invested that on ETHBTCXMRCASH and made 10x? Cool they're going to go ahead and take some of that too. Buy some land with what you got left? Better get used to paying them rent every year via property tax. Still feeling that land of the free vibe? Crypto taking over would not completely solve your problems is all I'm saying. In fact it likely won't be much different at all in the grand scheme of things.

The only one that comes to mind for that scenario is the copy/paste virus. You copy an address, the virus changes it to the hacker's address. That's easily avoided by triple checking your address. Once the funds are securely on your hardware wallet there's no way (that we know of) for anybody to steal them... short of you giving up your device + pin or having your seed phrase compromised (DO NOT STORE IT ON YOUR PC/PHONE)

Gotta spend it to help adoption my friend. I go out of my way to order from sites which take bitcoin. I've found they're usually great anyways, equal to if not better than competitors.
@_date: 2019-05-10 09:30:05
Yep you'd be able to tell it was changed as long as you checked. That method relies on the person trusting copy and paste blindly without checking (which you shouldn't regardless). I personally just check the first 4-5 characters and the last 4-5 characters. This not only ensures you're safe from the above scenario but if you copy and pasted it makes sure you entered the full address and didn't add on any extra characters by mistake. If you ever type an address manually you'd want to check the full thing multiple times for obvious reasons.

Coinbase is the most friction-less option for a US buyer. It's also a great exchange overall honestly I just don't like the invasion of privacy. If privacy is your goal then there's definitely better, albeit typically more costly, options.

You can buy Amazon gift card codes with BTC instantly using bitpay (along with countless other types of gift cards). Not really the same as "buying with bitcoin" on amazon but it works great, you don't get ripped off on the price, and it's instant.
