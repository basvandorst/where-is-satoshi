what you're not understanding is that there are two main types of bitcoiners: the investors looking to turn a profit and the true believers who think this is the currency of the future. the former make their money off the naiveté of the latter.

holy shit you're dumb. what the hell are you thinking getting involved in bitcoins when you don't even have a basic 101 level understanding of economics?

yeah, and why do we waste all this time and money making sure food is up to regulatory standards before it is sold? why not just sell it and if people start getting sick and dying then we know not to buy that particular food. the free market works!

this is your one and only life. when you're on your death bed and you think back on your life do you really want your first thought to be "boy i sure did jack off a lot?"

do you know what sub you're in? you really don't need to link the wiki on antifragile. in fact, you don't even need to post about it. it can be safely assumed that any time there are any issues with bitcoin someone out there is going "b-b-but antifragile!"

i wouldn't be the least bit surprised if i found out you're 16 and you have never been in a relationship in your life. maybe i'm wrong, but that's sure as hell how you come across.

people have been using the baby excuse to handwave the volatility for a long time now, but the thing is unless bitcoin is around for 100+ years it isn't a baby. in fact if it were to die a year from now then bitcoin is currently an old man.
