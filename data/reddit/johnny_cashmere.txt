Sorry I meant trading FIAT for Crypto xP
The fear is what would cause him to sell, first, angry he "lost money", then hating himself for being so stupid, and finally SELLING IT ALL and being left to suffer as the price recorrects.

I already know I am ignorant, that is why I am asking for help lol, just trying to avoid pitfalls. And the consensus in my head tells me I didn't use the word wrong the first time.
Also thanks for the reply, what separates an exchange that doesn't support USD/BTC and one that does? Or has that not been distinguished in our language yet?

Good thanks so much! First bit of advice that seems to align with my research, I pulled an all nighter to educate myself, keep pouring on the love people!
Amazing how EUR and USD can be incompatible with companies that won't tell you otherwise but still work for the alternative currency/country. Talk about biting off more than you can chew!
