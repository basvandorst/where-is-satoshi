Local bitcoins. Companies here request customer information cause they want to reduce fraud. Banks in AU are generally hostile towards bitcoin based business so they have to do everything they can.
The second reason is an expectation of bitcoin falling under AML laws in the future so companies pre empt it.

Look, it's a bit of an odd spot bitcoin is put in simply because the existing definition of money cannot be used for virtual currency.

This is where I disagree that Apple is driven purely zealotus fervour. It does exist but the fact is that Apple do make good products. They created a sleek looking smartphone (which they are not the first but) that was easy to use and I think it's the same values that will propel tokenization forward.
While they do not maintain majority market share, I feel that their numbers have more than enough critical mass behind it.
I think there are also some aspects that are missed in regards with previous tokenization efforts and Apple's. One of the things Apple do well is making a product for the masses. Bitcoin unfortunately is not there yet.
@_date: 2014-09-15 15:08:22

Its not paranoia when one party holds 50% of hashing power that we knows. There are 20% unknown hashing power sources. Ghash could very well be over 51%, does that not alarm you greatly?
@_date: 2014-09-15 13:21:36
I stand corrected. Then I guess the argument comes down to the fact that Apple has the clout to make tokenization the defacto standard instead of other players. The payment market is very complicated with tons of players, takes someone big and forceful to make a difference.
So the question is why has tokenization efforts failed in the past to gain traction?

I don't think so. Remittance is the killer app because it is a need not a minor want. Most people have 3G/4G and do NOT have bitcoin. Why should they jump through hoops after hoops just to get wifi?
@_date: 2014-03-12 15:21:26
Yes. Absolutely. This is how the free market works in that the shop can accept raw bitcoins but they have no way of accepting electronic fiat without a third party so it is not the same comparison. BitPay provides a hedging service and if people want to sign up to something that bitcoins do not provide, then they need to follow the third party payment processor's ToS.
@_date: 2014-10-13 18:17:13
Most people don't care and in general CCs (especially when card is present) are not as unsafe as the bitcoin community makes it out to be. 
It is correct that you have to trust their system and that has been proven to be an issue but with tokenization (ala Apple Pay), security is going to be better.

Just because it is cheaper will hardly makes a business model work because human behaviour takes a lot of other factor into account, one of the prime being convenience. Most people just really cant be bothered to set up and buy bitcoin over multiple steps just to pay for wifi especially when they are not familiar with it.
Projects such as this are only successful when bitcoin is mature.

That's a highly simplistic view of things. Many industries have regulations because the alternative is tragedy of the commons. Environment, finance are two prime example. Regulation itself is not bad but is inherently complicated and needs robust checks and balances. There are many countries with good regulation.
Monopoly itself is not an issue provided:
1. Companies do not abuse their monopoly (Microsoft and IE).
2. Companies do not form regulations that block out competitors (Comcast).
Monopolies are what most companies want as it is how they maximize profit, it's just how the capitalist system works.

Australia has removed signatures and rely solely on PIN (items above $100) and NFC for items under. I think the security is immensely improved and with tokenization and proper NFC implementation (like Apple Pay) most major risks are almost eliminated for both parties.

Blockchain is at the end of the day a technological tool, just like TOR or VPNs.  It is ideologically neutral.  The users define how it be used and therein lies the ideology. It would be blatantly expected that you guys spiel the same defense for those services so do not use the same counter argument for blockchain.
To top it off, be fucking realistic, the world is fucking messy and complicated. What the flying fuck would you expect of a world without passport is going to be? A god damn utopia where violence is going to disappear and everyone is going to chill out and smoke some weed?

Which is? Honestly, I am not privy to it and I do not know Apple Pay enough to comment on it yet.
Besides just because one implementation is faulty does not mean all are. Bitcoin is not the absolute truth you know, it's a massive live experiment.
For most people, the path of least resistance is often the favored one. In fact, CCs have improved in accessibility (debit visa), ease of use (Contactless. Yes I know it is not popular in the US but it has been used in AU and it's incredibly popular. Once merchants get the machines upgraded, people will use them) and security (chip and pin) year on year. Not saying they are the only way to do things but to wish they die quickly and get replaced by something else is silly.

@_date: 2014-09-17 15:10:18
On one hand that is true but on another, consumer protection costs are passed on to the merchant which is passed back to the consumers anyway. Until recently frauds are a big deal and they add a ton of costs to the consumer and this is not even taking into account the massive cost these payment companies charge on the merchant.
But back again on the first hand, I doubt merchants will pass on the costs to the consumer and even if they did the amount is very minor to make a difference. Now that said if the savings are passed back to the consumer, how much would an average consumer save per year.

Also subsidizing a certain industry might not be a bad idea because if the industry has a lot of related industries and consist of a large % of the country's GDP, it is there to prevent shock to the economy. It needs to be done with caution but reality is that outside forces can fuck you over.

I know first hand from one of the people who worked on this legislative changes that is not the case.
For the most part it means exchanges need to collect 100 pts of identity for KYC and do reporting of transactions over 10k for AML and suspicious transaction in general. Now, currently your bank can ask you where the money comes from as is even without the legislation in place.
Australian laws on digital currencies are actually VERY good in that GST for example is not taxed on bitcoin sale starting from 1st of July.

Hysteria should not exist on both sides but traditional banking does not have such problem on a daily basis. Bitcoin's ecosystem (not bitcoin itself) on the other hand has went through a fair amount of security breaches which render regular transaction fair less safer than traditional banking. 
Before anyone jump on credit cards fraud, you do not lose anything as credit card companies absorb the costs. Nothing as such exist in the bitcoin ecosystem. The reality is that bitcoin is in it's infancy and ecosystem problems are to be expected for a long time to come until the ecosystem stabilizes and matures. Anyone thinking it is a reliable alternative to traditional banking now is delusional.

Bitcoin's poor appeal to the mass consumer.
Seriously Bitcoin is fucking cool but for the masses it just have poor appeal. Look at it this way, holding bitcoin is like holding a foreign currency or gold which most people do not do so because on a day to day and month to month basis your value is too volatile.
Let's look at a the 10 year chart for USD to EUR [here]( As you can see for 2 of the world's major currency it is still damn volatile. People just do not like that at all. Please don't talk about hedging because that's just not what normal people do.
People also do not want to be their own banks because that means securing their money is now their risk. Yes, banks have their flaws but not system is perfect and for the most part it works good enough (FDIC insurance, etc). This goes for online payment systems. Chargebacks, benefits, etc are what consumers are willing to pay in fees for, no different to how car insurance is attractive to drivers.
Hosted wallet is here to stay and can get FDIC but they do not offer many benefits of non cash payment systems such as Paypal and credit cards.
Bitcoin just offers no killer app feature for the average consumers.
I personally think there is a place for bitcoin but it will be more like a hybrid of gold (store of asset) and B2B. B2B transactions do not get the benefits I mentioned consumers receive and deals with the issues that Bitcoin has such as hedging but provides benefits such as faster payment. I believe one of XAPO's executive said that B2C is a sideshow and I agree.
There are many superior techs that fail because friction/cost is too high. Bitcoin for consumers is where it is at.
In regards for the underbanked, I believe Bitcoin can serve the remittance market but not for a day to day use.

Huh? Stop making assumption. I am just pulling out economics 101 man, economics for the most part is across the board assumptions. Yes, economics is a flaky field but many econs 101 principle are quite sound. 
I never said if people should speculate or not.  I am a speculator myself but I am just rationalizing VC's decision. I speculate because I cannot pull 15m out of my ass. If I can I would sure as fuck start so many businesses it would make you think twice like I am some central planner commie. I just feel that based on economic theory, they are making a more sound judgement than speculating. 
By the way, I never said bitcoin economy will not recover. I just merely mention that speculation lead to big price volatility which is not the best thing to have in the big picture and it also leads to slow recovery, stagnation or even further reaction because gasp, there is a lack of money used that is used to be invested in the market. Stagnation or generally a reaction can be bad because it shows an incentive not to invest and from that incentive there might be a possibility that there will be a net decline in investors because it is not profitable as few people are using bitcoin as currency.
Thus, the free market can simply decide to abandon bitcoin as a currency or reduce it to insignificance because it has turned into a commodity (ie: enough percentage of bitcoin used for speculating which results in a lack of volume used in legitimate transaction to provide a critical mass for transactional business  to beprofitable.). Speculations can make bitcoin a failure (remember it was designed as a currency in mind, not a commodity).
Oh, and using bitcoin is a choice. Unlike government tendered currency, there is nothing forcing us to use it to buy our daily necessity, that itself can simply be the final blow to bitcoin.
To be honest, my own view is that bitcoin is a hybrid of the two but for it to truly succeed, there has to be a lot less speculation compared to transaction. I also think the utility of bitcoin is excessively valuable and it will persist in the future for transactions. Yet, it might fall out of irrelevance as a currency adopted by the masses because of reasons given above. It might end up servicing niche markets (such as remittance) and that in many eyes, bitcoin is a failure.
PS: 15m is enough to cause another massive crash like the one last month with ease. 15m is more than 2 days' total transaction volume on mtGoxUSD and remember, that volume is a combination of both BTC being sold and bought. And that is not to mention the news of VCs speculating on bitcoin driving it up further.

Gold price fell from 1700 to ~1300 this year. That is not what you consider stable either. Gold 10 years ago was 324 (not adjusted by inflation and even with inflation it should not reach 1300).
We are in the bitcoin industry, we should denominate our services in Bitcoin. Denominating it after anything else is a bad idea because the act sure as hell does not instill any confidence in XBT if the administrator of the defacto bitcoin forum does not use it. 
Businesses change their pricing according to the value of their currency, XBT should be no different and a script can be simply used to peg the bounty in real time to a stable currency.
If he talks about stability, he should denominate the bounty in either Swiss Franc, SG Dollar, NZ Dollar or US Dollar in that order. Or heck use the Stable Currency Index (

No, that is absolute rubbish because it is not ~~adjusted by inflation~~ cross referenced with income so it means nothing. 
Opps my mistake.
Look, it's fiat, it's designed around Keynesian school of thought that hoarding makes recovering from a depression difficult so it is designed to lose value because it is an economic incentive for the person to invest. Of course many of you do not believe this and that is fine but the context is meaningless without cross referenced with avg income. US probably fucked up there mainly not because of using fiat but because your country's economic and finance policies are fucked up. There are many countries that use fiat and end up quite alright (hey Scandinavia, Australia!). 
Look, I believe in bitcoin but I am do not vilify fiat. I personally think fiat makes sense but that many governments do not uphold the pillars that make fiat work. Of course I am just an amateur economist so what I say has little credibility so I want to hear sound arguments on both on ends of the spectrum but that has not happened.

I think the question to start with is that what was the reason it rose so high even during the good years (ie: &lt;2008). Maybe it's cause all the debt the US racked up during their wars? Gold rising in bad economic times is well documented and the fall is expected too. The fall is understandable because the economy is recovering and the US stopped their quantitative easing which means the inflation for USD slowed.

I think 5% + $5 is not a great idea because most of your customers will be buying small amounts. If they buy &lt; 100 USD worth, then those are some very expensive fees. Why &lt;100? Because of how your anti fraud system works (what you mentioned 1st week &lt; 1 BTC which at the price now is ~110).
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:34:42
Good luck trying to rationalize that, we all know perfectly well pools are there to facilitate the generation of bitcoins. If you are mining, you know what you are doing and so do I. Tx fees are not the majority of our profit and many pools do not payout tx anyway. If you think FinCEN are that dumb as to eat that justification, you might need tone down your bitcoin fanaticism and if you are a big miner, you might want not want to be on the ugly side of the IRS.

I find that the bitcoin community has this legion of gold standard fanboys not seen even in economists or finance community. It's a little elitist wanna-be club, seriously.
I could as well put a picture of a mining rig with the words "Worse than gold" and it would have made similar points across by bitcoin's detractors.
Look, I love the bitcoin concept but we need to get off this high horse because 99.999% of the time when people use a currency whether it is fiat or gold standard, they do not know the terms nor care for it. 
What we should do is to promote an ad from a practical perspective such as " no fees", "no quasi-legal authority (looking at you paypal)" or something to that effect.

The market was greedy and all mining shares were overvalued. Simply put, people were not doing their research and hype build upon hype. When people realized they cannot ROI reasonably at 4 BTC per share (with competition in the mining sphere), someone started to liquify and others followed, so a panic sell developed and here is where we end up at.
Is AM worth 4++ BTC? Probably not since they wont be monopolizing the market anymore but I do think if Friedcat do not fuck up with Gen2 deployment, the are worth at about ROI of 3 at dividends of about 30%.

Of course someone will pay for it one way or another, that is something we cannot run away from. If it means the customer paying say 2% of each purchases as a form of insurance against fraud, it is up to the customer to decide their worth and I do think there is some worth to it.

If you are using that as a defence, it is weak because one of the factors affecting gold is an inverse relationship to USD's value which XBT (probably will) shares. More so, if you compare gold's value to USD's value which after taking inflation into account, gold's value rose substantially higher. That rapid growth is counted as instability. Besides, whatever the reason, I have shown the fact that gold is not stable as you claimed.
Hence, it would be a better idea to denominate bounty in BTC (man you HAVE to set an example! Why can't you see that?) and peg it to Swiss Franc like my other post suggest or even use an index which will minimize currency value fluctuations.

As a consumer I do not really care and that is what matters. It's like a car, I do not have to know the mechanics, just that it works. In fact as a consumer I like the benefits credit cards provide (travel insurance, anti fraud and of course credit ability!). The funny thing is that I won't be surprised if I see a bitcoin credit card soon. 
Let's be real, each payment method has it's pros and cons. Identity theft for example is a big issue in credit card. Despite my love for bitcoin, I have always rallied against fanboyism because it is not a silver bullet.

Bitcoin was designed from the ground up as a stateless currency and it still is. We are invested in it's success based on that objective so don't try to rationalize it some other way because now it attracts the attention of regulators.
@_date: 2013-06-01 22:11:17
I can.
BitFountain, the company has 400k shares with promise of no dilution. ASICMiner, the publicly traded portion of the shares consist of 163,962 shares. 
Each share at IPO is 0.1 BTC. A boardseat is 5000 shares (500 BTC). 500 BTC then was about $6500. 
So, 1 share now is worth 2.47 BTC and each BTC is now worth 130 USD. 5000 * 2.47 * 130 = 1,605,500 USD. Best investment ever.
Bitfountain? 236,038 * 2.47 * 130 = 75,791,801.8 USD. I think friedcat says he has 2 other partners. So each person holds about 25m.

You know that is probably wrong. Bitcoin mining through ASICs are pure and simple speculative because using current prices to calculate ROI is not feasible.

I said never said ALL users who buy porn are tech idiots and senile fools. I mentioned very clearly that it correlates. 
The fact is that the ratio of people who consume vs pay for porn has decreased dramatically says a lot about the industry.
Most porn users are happy with pornhub quality and it is not malware ridden. The tech savvy people who buy are porn aficionados and/or have niche interest. They are not a large percentage of the industry consumers.
The porn industry will survive but it will change, much like the traditional publishing industry and the music industry. There will be a place for bitcoins in the porn industry but to think bitcoin use in the porn industry will be equivalent to the days when your everyman who wants porn probably has to buy porn and is a normal transaction is wrong. Hence the impact of bitcoins in porn will not be as strong as you think it will be.

I am ridiculously pissed at KnC. Hosted customers have not started hashing yet and this should not be the fucking case. We paid a premium and expect day 1 hashing, this is NOT day 1 hashing. Mining is most important in it's early days and every day not hashing is costing us into the hundreds. Margins are already thin enough as it is, I do not need this problem.
Oh, might I mention that I asked for a last minute change to my order to be hosted and they called me asking me to pay within the hour or else I would miss out on 1st day hashing because they were going to hash "TONIGHT". That was the fucking 1st and it's the 4th. As far as I am concerned that's downright fraud.

You sound like a conspiracy nut. With all due respect, your justification is pretty weak because you are taking the most extreme point of view with the flimsiest link. Seriously, governments have better things to do than to keep a dossier on someone who is gambling online. That said, you might think I am happy being tracked but no, my reason is simple and that is the fact I have a right to privacy. 
You can even go so far to argue the laws are behind the times. The internet is a fairly border-less place and an activity as innocent as gambling online should not be illegal. I never understood the justification anyway.

You might as well set the price in USD then. If you consider it unstable, peg the price in any other more stable currency using a script. Use the Swiss Franc if you consider USD unstable.
Gold has fallen from 1700/oz to 1300/oz that is not what you consider stable either. 10 years ago it was 324/oz. Even taking inflation into account, it's probably more volatile than just using USD.

If you think that is the ideal circumstance in which bitcoin would flourish in, you are grossly mistaken. Bitcoin is first and foremost not a community nor designed to be one. It is created to be a tool, one with great utility designed for the internet age but still a tool nonetheless. It just so happens to be a community because it is a niche at the moment and finding a bitcoin enthusiast to talk and share the interest is exciting because we are the enthusiasts. The rest of the world? They do not give two shits. People exchange currencies often (ie: when we travel) and people (including us) use those services without raving about the community (if there is even one) behind it for good reason because it's so ubiquitous a community based around that interest would be fairly silly. It's like having an electricity user's appreciation society, isn't that a bit silly?
Coinbase and bitinstant are struggling under the success of bitcoin and that is all there is to be. Many of our services we take for granted such as your mobile phones, the internet, postal service, etc have shit reliability when they were in their infancy. It's all growing pains, that is all. 
This post has the silliest justification I've heard in ages and you, the fanatics need to get off your high horse. We need to promote bitcoin to masses, not make it an elitist club.
Edited cause I had this magical moment where I was able to articulate my thoughts a lot better than what I wrote previously.

Of course, it all comes down to the courts but laws can be made and it will not be overturned until someone challenges it. 
You are free to challenge their notion (or band a group of people together to do so, this is bitcoin, free market at it's finest and at the end of the day the responsibility falls to us to shape it however we feel it should) but if you do not want to challenge it, it probably is not wise to blatantly turn your back on their rulings.

Yes you are right I am mistaken that way. But the concept of dilution (the company issuing more total shares right?) after an IPO doesn't make sense much to me, neither it fair nor heard of.
I have to admit, you must be so happy about your investment and I am envious. I heard a bit about it but at that time I was on a hiatus away from bitcoin. Also, it was a humongous risk back then but I guess $6500 for a board seat is something if I thought about it thoroughly, would have been willing to invest. In fact, if i meet with the person and talk more clearly I would have been willing to invest more. Their business case made a ton of sense, but it was just the trustworthiness that was the issue.

Thank you for the reply.
So if the net profit did not warrant a .1BTC/share dividend, then ASICMiner share holders get 100% of the profit? That was a great deal if it was the case. Was it long before .1BTC dividend was hit?
Regarding the dilution protection, I know it was designed as such but I do not see the issue of shares being diluted. As mentioned above, if I own 100 shares and it got diluted to 50% then i get 200 now. My dividend in total and share value is still the same. So why was it necessary?

This is very nice but I feel at the end of the day this is just for the bitcoin enthusiasts. I do not know how does this work in the country you launch in but here in Australia where online payment is now the main form of bill payment without extra costs, your business model adds extra cost to me for no good reason. 
I feel merchant adoption has always been the key to bitcoin's success, not the other way around. Your business model might be profitable but at the end of the day it's a pointless exercise.

Good point. How about say 51%. It will reduce the growth rate substantially.Hoarding 15m will just make them speculators and often, speculating is a self fulfilling prophecy which if the currency is driven by such growth, has a tendency to crash. These people are not speculators and they know it. They are in the aim of funding business which has the aim of constantly generating income. Hoarding bitcoin does not generate income nor can give a magical number where bitcoin will stabilize at (with a more gradual value appreciation due to it's deflationary nature). It also has a cap on it's growth once it stabilizes. Do you see why they would rather invest in a company now?Finally, bitcoin's ultimate value is in it's utility and that can only come through building businesses around it. Speculating is harmful at such an early stage and takes away money that can otherwise be put into adding value to the economy. I'm quite sure previous crashes have shown you that.

Really? I disagree because 4 common words with a space is not dictionary cracking. The cracker can put those under a specific cracking rule with it's growing popularity and if that is the case just change that to "Correct! 4horses staple battery" and it is still easier to remember. Or even have an easy to remember pass phrase such as "I work at 1 Infinite Loop, Cupertino" would be impressively powerful.

Nothing actually. But for the same reason bottled water is a good business model. It's probably also better to host it online as home connections can be unreliable but now, that adds another layer of complexity outside the reach of the masses.
The reality is that most people care more about ease of use more than security. Credit cards is a good example as it should have 2FA built into 10 years ago and it will only be implemented in 2 year's time as a compulsory measure in the EU (The EU might be asinine on certain issues but they sure are at the forefront of consumer protection).
