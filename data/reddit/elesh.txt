Its money period. Currency that people can use in transactions rather than barter. 
It's not created out thin air, but rather raw computing power. How is that less good? What would you have more faith in?

Well he earned it *not* flipping burgers. You can't undervalue having meaningful productive work that develops your skill sets.
