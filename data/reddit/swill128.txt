Not more people, more coins are being up for sale than there are being purchased, right?

I just don't know what you all expect law enforcement to do when you're caught breaking the law. Again, I'm not saying the LAW shouldn't be changed, but if we don't expect law enforcement to enforce the law, what do you expect from them?
@_date: 2019-07-10 11:26:52
Well it sounds like you were using it to buy something illegal which would be an appropriate reason for the seizure. You can disagree with the law but you shouldnt disagree with law enforcement enforcing the law.

It is? How? Lending, taking on debt, and establishing credit are how banks work.

Sorry, the peak before the peak before it.

Do not buy the dip. You canno time the market. Waiting for a crash will not maximize your returns. Buy as soon as you have the money.  Each trough is higher than the peak before it so buying early is the key to success.

That’s how it should work yeah, but banks can loan out essentially unlimited amounts of money, and as long as people are paying them back they’re in the clear.
I know this is how we got the 2008 crash, but nothing changed since then.

Plot twist, the bank doesn’t have $600k either!

It's an ad for a job board though...I don't understand what they're trying to say.  It send like they're saying "lost all you money to Bitcoin? Come look for jobs here" but security clearances require solid financial standing so they wouldn't want to advertise to someone who's bankrupt.
@_date: 2018-06-10 12:34:57
Okay but as an ad for a job board where users must have a security clearance it doesn't make any sense. The ad is implying Bitcoin is a risky investment, but you won't get a security clearance if you're not in good financial standing so I don't know what it's trying to say.

You know saying things like that are just as likely to put you under surveillance as admitting you do illegal things...

Yep, not even 6 weeks.

Your rights have already been violated, you're activity is already being tracked. Saying "don't use that because kyc is a violation of rights" is just as much of a tip-off to the authority as browsing black market sites.

AT which point more people will buy until it reaches another all time high.  This has happened again and again. Block chain and decentralized currency are powerful ideas. They aren’t going anywhere

This is what happens without regulation. Do you want libertarian utopia or governmental control? You don't get both.
@_date: 2017-09-09 05:15:38
But with a modicum of regulation the big powerful rich people and companies will just invest more resources into getting around the regulation, which brings more regulation.
I'm actually all for regulation, it ensures steady growth over the long haul, shortens the peaks but fills the valleys too.

Maybe this already exist but I'd like a graph various currencies ( crypto and fiat) plotted against bitcoin with time being the x axis. The graphs I usually see are comparing the coins to dollars.
