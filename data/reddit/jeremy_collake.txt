LOL, yea they get cash up-front alright. And you/me/whoever lose cash up-front. Cloud mining is common sense scam. That said, out of curiosity, I tried one, and finally got enough to withdraw, and haven't even been able to withdraw, lol. Scammers

I signed up at Minergate's Cloud Mining as an experiment. A assumed a loss, but figured I'd get at least some of it back, and maybe all over a really long time. However, I didn't know they'd straight-up rob me. Supposedly I have this mining going on, until it accumulates to where I can withdraw it. BUT when I go to withdraw, it stays in a "processing" state for a couple weeks, then goes to "failed", then back into my 'supposed' holdings at Minergate. FWIW. I dunno why they would do this to themselves, maybe it's more like a ponzi scheme, and they do pay out if they have the money, or maybe it's a bug that has been allowed to persist indefinitely (feature).

Dunno if SEC or FBI, but definitely it is fraud by whatever name.

The entire US code (and US States 10x worse) is 'Super Weird', along with the IRS 'guidelines' (mandatory), and if anyone actually manages to figure it out, I am pretty sure they can shorten it too: "We [they] can do however we please, stfu".

And we know they are oh-so-trustworthy that when it comes time to pay out, especially in a bubble, certainly they wouldn't just retain your cryptocoins. Yet...

Many are most likely ponzi schemes tbh
