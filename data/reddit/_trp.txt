I think you've lost it a bit. They're not worse than mining companies that don't ship for a year or a company that disappears into thin air with your BTC. You didn't sign a contract or anything right? Just don't use it. If it's too expensive people won't use it and the fees come down or the company dies.

1. An exchange isn't equivalent to a bank account at all. An address in a wallet is where your money is held.
2. Paypal and GW are third party applications for the transfer of money. Off chain transactions can be instant as well. The only thing comparable to bitcoin in this respect is physically handing cash over in person.
3. Blockchain bloat is a non issue because drive capacity will outstrip blockchain growth
4. Bitcoin is as anonymous as you want it to be. There are ways of completely anonymizing the identity of the owner of any given coins.
5. Bitcoins can be taken, but it is completely dependent on how you store them. There are ways of holding bitcoin that are not practically seizable because there is no way to link them to any identity, let alone the owners.

My point is that a newb is going to be confused regardless. If his question was 'What is a microbitcoin?', this thread wouldn't exist, even though that does happen. If a uBTC was called a pip, he'd be asking, 'what's a pip'?


That will likely naturally happen if a higher price is sustained (above $1k). As less and less people transact in whole bitcoins, the bitcoin just become synonymous with the network, and less so the currency as the bit is used more and more.

Pretty much everyone thinks bitcoin can't work when they first learn about it, it's just that some people take the additional steps required to understand what is actually happening with the technology and why it could have potential. For those that don't, the disparity between what they think should happen and what is actually happening causes confusion ("why are people spending *real* money on a virtual game tokens?!"), which then leads to anger. That's why from their perspective bitcoin is always about to crash any day now, it's not about facts, it's about comfort. It's also why when talking to people that are anti-bitcoin they will rarely actually understand basic principles of the technology ("blockchain is great but bitcoin can't work!" etc). 
They don't want to validate bitcoin by taking time to learn about it because that would amount to admitting defeat, so they are trapped in a low information - high confusion state.

For purely internet based payments the 'push' transaction of a bitcoin spend is superior to the 'pull' payment of a CC. When you upload your CC details to a website you are trusting that they keep that information secure and only charge the amount they said they would. You can't have extra fees applied with bitcoin unless you agree and send the payment beforehand, and they don't have any of your bank details to re-charge you in the future. 
Once you are inside the bitcoin ecosystem buying things online across multiple websites is much smoother with BTC. No card detail entry, verified by visa passwords or security numbers, just copy-&gt;paste-&gt;send. The fraud protection isn't there because a CC is just an agreement to pay in the future, not an actual payment like cash or BTC. But fraud protection will likely be available in the future with bitcoin third party processors for those that want it.

Because it's tactile, people can understand the value of gold by holding it. With bitcoin it is conceptual so psychological impact of "size" on value is far more important. People on the whole will be more comfortable handing over $1 for 1000 of something than they would for 0.001 of something.

I personally am of the opinion that people that are new to bitcoin shouldn't be mining, at least not for anything other than a hobby that will cost them money. It's like someone that has never been to an airport walking into one and asking 'So how do i fly one of these planes?'
Mining was initially just technical, now it requires technical knowledge and a large investment to see any worth while returns (if any are made at all).

You rarely directly use your private key, but your wallet knows all your private keys. Every address you have has a private key so if your wallet is showing you 10 public keys it is holding the 10 private keys out of sight (in the wallet.dat file most likely). The password you use to log in has nothing to do with your private keys and just allows you to access your wallet.dat file.
You may use a private key when moving funds to a new wallet without using the bitcoin network. You could import the private key into a new wallet (copy and paste it into the new wallet) and your bitcoins would appear there.

When bitcoin was worth pennies, it was geeky. I wouldn't say it is that geeky anymore. It's just *hard*.
You need to be knowledgeable enough of the technology to both understand its potential use cases and feel comfortable enough to sink time into learning, and money into buying.
You will need to be at least somewhat of a risk taker. Risk averse people are going to avoid bitcoin like the plague because it is an unproven asset grafted onto the back of an untested emerging technology. Even if completely comfortable with the technology, a risk averse person isn't going to put their money into a high variance/high risk asset.
You also need lateral thinkers. Nothing about bitcoin is about sticking to the status quo. People that can only see everything as it is today are going to struggle with bitcoin. "I can use my debit card for that already", while a valid argument is completely missing the potential of where the technology can take us and thusly the reason people are using bitcoin today. Granted you can't have this understanding of its potential if you are not knowledgeable of the technology, which takes us back to square 1.
So imagine a venn diagram: bitcoiners all live in the section where tech savy, risk taker and lateral thinker all overlap. It's not a big area.
With time each of these requirements will be lessened, but for now this is why even many 'geeks' are not going to be receptive to the idea of cryptos.

Bitcoin isn't a distance or weight, it's digital. Length and weight have the advantage of being physical attributes.

You are exactly right, which is why you should understand why Doge will never supplant Bitcoin and why a sidechain is superior to an alt.


Exactly. So why Bitcoin? Because it is what the market is going to choose. The bitcoin infrastructure is far more developed than all the alts combined, the market caps reflect this. So if all bitcoin alts and bitcoin are all the same in terms of its use, except bitcoin is accepted at 1000's more stores, has more exchanges, has more ATMs, more companies utilizing the protocol, more documentation on development and use, what is someone that has never used crypto going to be more likely to use? That is the current network effect, and is why bitcoin is consuming more of the crypto pie over time.  
Sidechains allow this far higher user number to gain whatever supposed technical advantage the alt has, without uprooting from the entrenched infrastructure. A Doge-sidechain would be equal to Doge but with increased security and user number of the bitcoin network. There are no downsides to using the sidechain over the alt and many pros. The flow of users is going to be to the better technology, which is the sidechain.

Their profit isn't really connected to mining at all, the 'mining income' is just the carrot that attracts the people that haven't run the numbers and realized it is not profitable vs just holding BTC. This is why they want as large a % of the hashrate as possible, it is the best possible advert for them, and why it is hard to keep up with them as they can mine unprofitably and still profit overall.

I didn't think it was going to do well in 2011 either. I gave bitcoin maybe a 2% chance of surviving. But the value proposition was still there, because I knew if it did succeed the price was going to increase by more than 50 times. They don't need to think it is going to work, just understand that on the off chance it does, stuff is going to happen, including huge returns. I'm a lot more confident than 2% these days.

And it isn't, because bitcoin used as a transactional token isn't volatile at all. The volatility is swallowed by the merchant processor. Bitcoin is only volatile when held as an asset, which companies deciding to hold it as an asset, fully understand.
@_date: 2014-09-10 19:08:48
If you are holding bitcoin it isn't being used as a currency but an asset. This is where your confusion is coming from, you are trying to compare bitcoin to traditional currency and it is confusing you. 
Bitcoin can be used as a transactional medium and held as an asset, mutually exclusively. In dollars these two properties are dependent on each other, with bitcoin they are not. For businesses holding bitcoin on their balance sheet, it is an asset. For companies accepting it via Bitpay, it as a currency.
Fluctuation does not affect companies accepting bitcoin via third parties (the currency). Fluctuation also doesn't effect long term holders of bitcoin (the asset) because its trend long term is deflationary.

Variance will not force a complete loss of interest in bitcoin. For one it will always attract traders. Then eventually supply runs out. This is one of the strengths of bitcoin. If you want to attempt to manipulate it through supply, you have to buy into it first.
I would say they will try to stop it, but it wont be through selling bitcoin. They will try to manipulate the price down through fear mongering but will also, while denigrating it, be stockpiling coins off the books as a plan B just in case they can't stop it.

That's the wrong way round. You are betting on the price of bitcoin denominated in USD so the bet value should be in USD, otherwise there is unfair equity on the 'over' side. ie we both bet 1BTC each, I bet under, you bet over $600. If it ends $700, you win $1400 of BTC. If it ends $500, I win, but i only win $1000 worth of BTC, for the same amount of value risked. No one betting under should take the bet.
The bet should be for '$xxx' or '$xxx worth of bitcoin', independent of bitcoin price.

While this is all true, you can only learn all this once you understand what bitcoin is.

the use of milibits would die out as the common nomenclature moves to bitcoin/bits/satoshi, but even before it does there is a 6 order of magnitude difference between 1 mBTC and 10 satoshi so context would clarify value easily, i.e. are you buying a mansion or a packet of sweets. No one would be using milibit to describe a sub unit of a bit because smaller units are denominated in satoshi (and a milibit in our new context doesn't even exist), like there are no milidollars. Our cents are satoshis.

Volatility was way worse 2 years ago. Every weekend mtgox would get ddos'd and the price would drop 40% and then recover by Monday. Volatility goes down as usage increases and liquidity rises. If Bitcoin is too volatile for investors now, it has always been to volatile for them and it will remain to be so for a while yet. Bitcoin isn't currently for average investors, it is for v.high risk v.high return investors. The people putting money in bitcoin now are not expecting it to act like equities, currencies or commodities, they will understand the kind of vehicle bitcoin is.
Once that volatility is low it will means the period of large gains in value are finished, and it just becomes a hedge against inflation.
20% is nothing, and the type of people that will put their money in bitcoin, know that.

Cloud mining is never going to be profitable unless you can offload the hashes onto someone else for more than they are worth. It's trading, not mining. They will never mine more than they cost.
If you want to mine profitably you'd need direct access to the hardware for cheap and cheap electricity.
All in all you are better off just buying and holding bitcoin. Many people end up investing 10 BTC in miners only to end up with 6 BTC after 2 years. If you buy 10 BTC and hold, in 2 years you have 10 BTC.

I don't think it started out as a scam, I think Vitalik is super smart and did legitimately want to come up with a new interesting technology that was legit. The problem is he is a computer guy, not a leader of men, so a few guys that feel like they missed the boat with bitcoin are desperate to find btc2.0. They jump on vitaliks back and are trying to steer it to meet their agenda. Look at how bloated the 'team' is now. How many of these guys can even program? There are 20 pilots in the cockpit and only a few of them know what the fuck they are doing.
Also I doubt it is a coincidence that the fundraising was suddenly started right after the BitLicence guidelines were issued stating that anyone making an alt without a license is breaking the law.

Both would be an insult, because a 10 cent tip would never be seen as sincere unless you understand the context that its given in.

It is not unsafe with some knowledge. The best way to learn is to just buy a small amount, an amount that you wouldn't mind if you lost and keep it in a usable but lower security environment like a phone or online wallet. You can then learn the ropes and look into cold storage for securing larger amounts once you are more familiar with what you are doing. You are unlikely to buy $20 worth of BTC and get instantly hacked, but if your computer happens to be insecure/have malware its a cheap lesson.

It's interesting watching people stick to old school techniques of safe guarding goods even when what they are securing allows so much more flexibility than a physical object. People need to start being a bit more creative with their safety, a key is just a string of letters and numbers after all. You can hide a string of 40 characters *anywhere* in almost any medium. You could even hide keys in a way where they are hidden in plain sight. A lockbox is what burglars look for. Put your keys somewhere a burglar would never dream to look. And always keep backups!

The thing is as the BTC price rises, almost everyone will decrease their absolute BTC holdings as it becomes a larger and larger % of their net worth. I doubt the Winklevii would still be holding 130,000 BTC if the price got to 10k if they had 'only' $30 million in traditional assets, it would be insane. Naturally as the price rises, they and other large holders, sell some % off.

This is true but only to people already accustomed to cryptocurrency. To people outside of crypto it looks and feels like spam because in the real world a 10 cent tip would be offensive.

There is an argument to be made that the outcome of this experiment is binary. As the utility of each dollar you gain falls as you accumulate more wealth, if the price of BTC rises high enough, there may be a point in time where the gain in utility between having 250 and 25 BTC is not worth it vs initial risk of investment. It depends on personal factors.

Keys come in pairs, public and private. The private key is like the password needed to access any bitcoin sent to the public address.
A HD wallet will generate the same keys when you use the same seed because the seed is just a representation of the Master Private Key. All of the private keys in an HD wallet are derived from a Master Private Key.
Seed --&gt; Master Private Key  
  
Master Private Key + 1 --&gt; first private key --&gt; first bitcoin address  
Master Private Key + 2 --&gt; second private key  --&gt; second bitcoin address  
Master Private Key + 3 --&gt; third private key  --&gt; third bitcoin address  
    
So as long as you know the seed, you can always derive the same list of private keys, which will give you control over the same list of bitcoin addresses

It's got nothing to do with easy money. The scarcity is fundamental to bitcoin's utility. 
You can't pass value through the network if the bitcoins themselves are worth $0. They need monetary value in order for the network to have utility. In order for bitcoins to not be worth $0 they need certain properties. One of which is some amount of scarcity. If every person on the network could create an unlimited amount of bitcoin, they would each have a value of $0 and the network would be useless.

Right, if they get some pips, they don't even know they've received bitcoins. They would still have to learn what a pip is, which is no easier than learning what a bit is.

It's the opposite. The institutional investors are positioning themselves nicely for the next rally by acquiring coins from people who panic bought in the rise to $1000+ and are either losing too much capital or losing faith in a technology they don't understand. The coins always flow from the weakest to the strongest hands but it takes time, that's what the trail off in price is, consolidation in strong hands, which creates the price floor that supports the next speculative rush. 
It's happened several times before and will probably happen a few times more.

In OP's case keeping money in fiat and intermittently changing into and out of bitcoin is his comfort zone for risk tolerance (low risk) but inevitably carries the delays that come with legacy banking. I don't fear the volatility of the market and so can make instant BTC payments. It's a trade off.
If the volatility is too high for people that is understandable, but what isn't understandable is then complaining on r/bitcoin that you can't get your bitcoin fast enough because a SEPA transfer took a week.

Just saying 'not bits' does nothing. If nothing better gains momentum it will end up being bits because there is an ease of use case for using smaller base units and so far nothing else has gained much momentum. 
IMO the pro of the marketability of transacting bits trumps the worry that of a subset of people will confuse the two in a niche scenario. I imagine in the few areas where data bits and bitcoin bits overlap people will make it clear what they are talking about by using XBT or BIT notations for clarity. ie Thai bitcoin exchanges won't use the ฿ symbol for bitcoin for obvious reasons.
1 million bits in a bitcoin doesn't require any explanation to a new user. It just works as is, intuitively. As long as I can say to people 'you can get 2500 bits for $1' and have them understand the nature of the granularity of a bitcoin right away, bits is going to get my vote.

If you are sending to a friend you are not going to double spend the coins so no fee is necessary unless your friend needs the coins soon. If you are at a market, most shops aren't going to be waiting around for 8-20 mins for the first confirmation so they are going to be using a 3rd party. The ones that don't use a 3rd party will mostly be accepting purchases on 0-conf anyway, so you wouldn't need to pay the higher fees

There is no hassle. The point is that the word doesn't have a widely used specific single meaning.

You would think so, but in reality it rarely happens. For instance in the UK the money is pounds and meat is sold in pounds.
"Can I have 5 pounds of beef?"  
"OK. That's 10 pounds."
Everything seems to work fine. Bit just isn't commonly equated to something specific enough for this to be a problem. bitrate != bit and megabits != bit. So realistically only when purchasing very specific technology could this possible confusion even arise. For 99.99% of all commerce it's a non issue.

You're thinking about this like a 'computer science guy'. Which is fine, but realize that 95% of the world aren't thinking of bits of entropy or computing bits.
Bitcoin has to be made as easy as possible in every conceivable way. Using 5 decimal places isn't the easiest way. converting back and forth between milli and micro isn't the easiest way. The easiest way is to define the base unit of bitcoin as the 'bit'. Maybe not the easiest thing for the programming guys, but easier for *everyone else*.

It could be a few reasons. They:
a) don't understand it. It's a natural human reaction to fear something that you cant understand, so in most cases it will be this.
b) they somewhat understand it now, but dismissed it in the past only to see the price appreciate 1000%. They feel like they 'missed the boat'. The 'what ifs' sickens them to where their hate of Bitcoin has overtaken their life. I have no doubt if the price tanked to &lt; $50 some of the most militant anti-bitcoiners would be buying some, money does weird things to people.
c) They are the type of people that never excelled at anything, and only really learned to take pleasure in the failings of others. They try to keep those around them at their level opposed to improving themselves because it is far easier. [Crab mentality](
d) They have genuine concerns with bitcoin which when paired with the fact that they are always on the internet, has grown to a resentment as bitcoin pops up on their screen more and more. They don't want to be proven wrong and the more positive the sentiments on r/bitcoin (as unsurprising as that may be in the *Bitcoin subreddit*) the more of an outsider they feel. This is why r/buttcoin exists, so that they don't feel alone in their position, no matter how often they are proven wrong.

Confirmation speed is inversely proportional to security (i.e the reason confirmations are used). A 2 min confirmation time is 5 times less secure than a 10 min confirmation.

It would likely do what it has done in the past. The quick price rise garners attention creating a buying frenzy, the increased demand raises the price and the positive feedback loop makes the price do a 10x, a whale sells and weaker hands sell and the price settles back to 50-80% of the ATH

They replace them because they take any of their claimed utility. Basically if you are trying to use the alt as a currency you would use the sidechain because it will have 10-100x more users. If you are trying to get rich with an alt you are going to try and take your chances with the alt, but it will fail as it will exist only as a shell, as it is owned only by speculators at that point, with no infrastructure for use.

No. Because he knows the price of bitcoin, because he just purchased 5 BTC worth.


So at this point in the future 5 bits ~ $5, so 5 BTC is ~ $5 million worth of bitcoin. How many people are going to be walking around with $5 million worth of bitcoin on their smartphone so that they can buy some smokes? 
Of this % of people how many people are going to be technically literate enough to own $5 million dollars of BTC and equally incompetent enough to hold $5 million in a hot wallet and get scammed for it?

Holding bitcoin has inherent risk. The higher % that they hold the more the market price of BTC effects their revenue. This isn't good with products with big companies with thin margins where you can make a load of sales and end up making a loss because the BTC price tanked that week.
I'm not saying it will never happen but it won't happen until volatility is way lower or companies have some kind of insurance policy against market crashes. Until the market matures, all (big) companies are going to be converting to fiat. 
But it doesn't matter. What they do with their bitcoin isn't important at all, just that they accept bitcoin.

Its a lot rarer now. Naysayers are all about the status quo. When bitcoin was only used by hobbyists it was easy for the uninitiated to call it a ponzi/scam. Once dell, microsoft etc start accepting it and regulation and ETFs start getting the go ahead, calling it a ponzi frames you as an uneducated outsider, so the argument has to shift. Most have now conceded that there is in fact some kind of future in cryptocurrency, but they are still invested in their initial position of 'this won't work', which is why the new status quo of "the blockchain is great but bitcoin isn't" has popped up. It's a nonsensical position, but it is the "safest" position (least polarizing) for the less technically inclined mainstream

I don't think its been ignored, its just harder to get full consensus when so much theorizing and prediction is involved. If and when bitcoins price stabilizes at a higher value, the shift will come quickly and relatively easily as it will be made out of necessity. The framework is already there, we have SI units as options in most wallets and an alternate naming convention: bits, in others like breadwallet. The market will do the heavy lifting.

They really are not, it takes a huge amount to overcome the feedback loops of something like bitcoin that spreads virally with inbuilt economic incentive. The alts all drink each others milkshake, diluting the resources of that demographic. This can be seen as the majority of alt holders hold BTC, but the majority of BTC holders don't hold alts.

They don't currently in any significant way. Look at the market caps. It is also reflected in the documentation on BTC vs Alts. There wont be any significant dilution until a consensus is found on whatever *the* viable alternative to bitcoin is.


Security is everything, not just in real terms but in perceived security because building trust takes time. People don't dump their savings into new alts in short time frames, which is what would be required for any kind of dilution of BTC to occur in the short term
