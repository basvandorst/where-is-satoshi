Authenticator rejected. Only phone working. Seriously fucking annoying, NOONE responds at Coinbase, NO way around it. Again, that's the game we're in and it's early stage, but damn, how unprofessional

Is anyone still unable to log into Coinbase? My Authenticator codes stopped working and I get the error page. Fucking frustrating honestly

Ok. I did not choose that, my bad I guess. I still can log in on my phone, but if they reset everything like they seem to do randomly, I'm screwed

Coinbase still not allowing me to connect on my laptop (does not recognize Authenticator codes), app going fine but seriously annoying
Am I the only one (I guess / hope not but sheesh...)

Thanks. I understand your point, but have not enough time - nor enough money at stake really - to get into more complex solutions. You'll obviously argue that risk + Coinbase not handling traffic is no simplicity, but I view BC strictly as a speculative tool, albeit a fun one. I go for the simplest solution, and I accept that they take advantage of this (also: they can be credited of bringing 100k's of new users to buy as well)

well I do, but then I have to use Authenticator (2 level security). The only working authenticator (ie that use the QR from Coinbase) is on my phone. Should I lose it I don't know of any other way to get into coinbase esp. to validate a sell order
