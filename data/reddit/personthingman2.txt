You could try out nicehash. It mines the most profitable altcoins for your system and pays you in bitcoin.

I think you're thinking of bitcoin as a company. With a web interface or something that you log into to use to make payments and such.
Bitcoin is simply a protocol. One that does not specify any personal identification except a private key. So there are no usernames/passwords, no unique user ID, no central system you need to 'log in' to. You need only follow the bitcoin protocol to transfer bitcoin.

Your key is randomly generated when you set up the device. All of the code is open source too, so if you really don't trust that you can search through that to see *exactly* what your ledger is doing.

[To answer your first question](
A hardware wallet is basically a paper wallet only you don't need to import it to a computer to spend coins. By importing your wallet, you risk your coins to any malware that may be on that computer. When you use a hardware wallet your keys never leave the device. So you could plug it into a 100% infected pc and you'll be completely safe.

This is not true.
LN is a distributed network. Not a 2 person P2P network. You do not need to have a channel open with the person you're making a transaction with. As long as you and the other person has 1 channel open to another node on the Lightning Network, your transaction can find a route to the recipient via hopping along existing LN channels until it finds its way there.
If you have 1 channel open, you can find a route to anyone else with a channel open.
This is of course assuming you don't have a network split, where you have 2 isolated networks, but this is solved the moment one node opens a channel with a node of the other network. But I have no doubt that the Lightning network will grow rapidly so this will not be an issue for long after launch.

It's completely within the banks rights to cancel the transaction. If you cannot convince the bank to let you make the transaction, switch banks.

The idea behind hardware wallets is so that you can securely store your bitcoin. You buy bitcoin wherever (coinbase, gdax, gemini, whatever), but what if where you store your bitcoin goes out of business? or gets shut down by the government? or gets hacked? This is why you buy your coins and then send them to your ledger for safe keeping.
It's like buying gold and taking it home and storing it in your safe.
@_date: 2017-12-04 18:26:09

As I understand it, No you don't need to open a channel with every vendor. If you want to send coins to a vendor that you don't have a channel with, you would send coins to a channel that you already have open and that transaction would bounce between open channels on the network until it made it to the vendor. 
So if you're node A and you want to send coins to node B but there is no channel between A and B. You could send coins to node C (which you do have a channel open with) with instructions to relay those coins to node B (assuming node C has a channel open with node B). If node C does not have a channel open with node B, then you can repeat the same process until a node is found with a channel open with node B.
I'm not too keen on the technicals so someone please correct me if I'm wrong.

GDAX is also good. You can deposit funds to it and if you do limit trading there are 0 fees. Market trading is also significantly cheaper than coinbase.
As for why I use gemini, it's because I lost access to my 2FA for coinbase/gdax and I'm waiting for support to get back to me. So I've been using gemini for now. It's not as pretty but it does about the same thing as coinbase. You can't buy with a credit card, but when you do a bank deposit, they give you credits so you're not missing out while waiting for your deposit to go through.

GDAX doesn't show the transaction until you have at least 1 confirmation, the ledger will show as unconfirmed the moment it hears it.

The difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks. So the difficulty would take a significant amount of time to drop down to those levels.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:26:09
Make sure your ledger is up to date I guess? I'm not sure why it wouldn't be there other than that.
Yeah you could wait for it to drop out of the mempool, it might even get confirmed in that time. You could also load up your seed in electrum or something and send the transaction again with a higher fee. That kinda defeats the purpose of a hardware wallet though.
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:04:17
You don't need to "log in" to a wallet to send a transaction. Bitcoin does not have "accounts" and it is not a service. It is a protocol. All of these desktop wallets and such just manage all your keys for you so you don't have to do it by hand. You can follow the protocol with a piece of paper and a pencil if you so desired, only using an internet connected device to broadcast a transaction.
You can use a service like [this]( to send the raw transaction data over the bitcoin network.

It goes to the miner that mines the block your transaction is contained in.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:15:57
Because every node verifies every activity on the blockchain. 
Lets say some miner decides to try and change the limit and give himself more coins in a block he just mined. Currently the block reward is 12.5 bitcoin, but our miner decides to change it to 100 bitcoin.
The miner will mine the block and send it out to the network. Every single node will look at that block and see that the miner tried to give 100 bitcoin to himself instead of 12.5. They will immediately reject the block because it does not follow the bitcoin protocol.

They would need to set up a channel unless whoever they get the coins from initially is kind enough to set the channel up for them, and your transactions would never be 100% settled on the network unless the channel is closed.

@_date: 2017-12-06 00:15:25
If less people mine the network will begin to slow down, which will cause the difficulty to re-adjust downward in order to maintain our 10 minute blocks. 
If the entire world stopped mining right now, I could run the entire bitcoin network with my phone after the difficulty adjusted.
The only reason bitcoin mining is such a huge problem is because it is profitable.

It's not a percentage, it's based on the size of the transaction *in bytes*. So if you set a 40 satoshi/byte transaction fee, and your transaction is 200 bytes - you'll pay a 8000 satoshi fee. Which is ~$0.94.

It gets a bad rep because it is fundamentally a scam. If you had tons of bitcoin miners, would you sell its hash power for less than you could make by just mining yourself? Their supposed business practices make no sense.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:46:09
Because what happens when your exchange gets hacked?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:50:17
No need - I don't have a soul in the first place.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:04:56
Yeah. Sorry it's really confusing. Use one of the wallets recommended on bitcoin.org: 
I would personally recommend electrum.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:59:23
I use bittrex for altcoin trading. It's all good for me. Just don't store large amounts in there.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:44:21
Yes you can. You can also use electrum, mycelium, breadwallet, and a whole ton of others.
@_date: 2017-12-18 05:43:23
Please read the rules before posting.
Rule 


@_date: 2017-12-01 04:58:48
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:59:30
RemindMe! 1 year
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:11:05
Yes? Is that not what you were asking?
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:58:05
I think it needs to be pointed out that you can nullify a transaction by double spending with a higher fee to another address. So you cannot trust a transaction until it is in a block.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:37:00
The government will find a way to tax it.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:24:58
You're literally asking people to send you almost $2,000. At least read the rules before posting:


@_date: 2017-12-02 06:02:07
Select 'Forget this transaction' in your wallet and send another transaction with a higher fee to an address you control.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:29:14
Contact coinbase. We can't help you.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:05:00
A change in the protocol would result in a hard fork. The new chain could have a higher supply, but the old chain still exists and it's rules apply.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:22:16
So you bought bitcoin through coinbase (bank transfer or credit card?), then you got an email saying $200 was transferred to coinbase. Now you have nothing in coinbase and $200 in GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:07:44
Make more salary.
In all honesty though, just put in like $20 a week or something.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:07:43
Because some countries are kind-of isolated financially due to strict international banking laws. Say you wanted to take advantage of this price difference so you set up an account on Mercado Bitcoin and send some bitcoin there and sell it. But how do you get your money out? They won't send it to a foreign bank account.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:38:28
It means blocks will come slightly slower.
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:24:40
What do you mean "recognized by the blockchain"? The blockchain contains transactions and only transactions. You loading your private key into another wallet is not a transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:32:42
Next release
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:59:02
Only a few hundred dollars. But I intended to buy more.

We have lots of new people who are not interested in memes
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:44:43
Regardless of the current state of the network, ethereum can handle significantly more transactions per second than bitcoin can.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:15:21
Yeah. Your private keys never leave the device itself, all transaction signing is done on the device. So you could plug your ledger into a 100% infected pc and be completely safe.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:19:12
If bitcoin dropping to $8000 screams exit to you, you're in for some real shit.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:55:39
If you transfer bitcoin out there should be no issue. Now if you transfer USD out, you may run into some problems with the IRS and the bank.
@_date: 2017-12-04 01:13:51
Nice. Not many people can make it in the day trading business.  
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:39:17
This is the sketchiest website I've seen in a while
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:41:18
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:18:42
coinbase charges 4% on credit card transactions and 1.5% on bank transfers.
You can bank transfer to GDAX and do limit orders for 0 fees.

@_date: 2017-12-18 22:11:44
Bitcoin is not a government
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:07:29
Depends, do you see potential in that coin? Is it worth the $30 loss to you?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:27:19
I like gridcoin, because mining it gets science done.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:56:34
Have you tried loading it up in bitcoin core yet?
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:17:24
But transactions are done on the Lightning Network. The only thing that needs to happen on-chain is channels opening and closing. I guess we'll have to see.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:26:56
What wallet are you using? If it's an online wallet, they like to clump transactions together to save on fees.
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:06:17
It's basically top down every block. Miners can include whatever transactions they want so why wouldn't they include the highest fee ones?
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:29:03
He said in his post the transaction had 200+ confirmations.
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:46:37
You only have to worry about taxes if you cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:29:10
only for a few seconds.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:26:31
They'll give you a transaction id when they send it out
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:16:14
I'm sure something like that exists but I've never seen it before. I wouldn't expect a community like that would require payment for help finding a paper though.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:20:59
Because most of them are traded in relation to bitcoin. Many alts you cannot buy using fiat directly. You have to buy bitcoin and trade that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:16:38


I fail to see how supporting a competitor of bitcoin would be considered treason.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:07:22
Then the LN channel doesn't close
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:51:10
You don't. You don't own that address and that output was never intended for you.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:23:21
Miners get transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:37:26
This is why everyone should use a segwit wallet
@_date: 2017-12-19 06:54:19
Nothing personal, but I don't trust you *at all* unless you provide a source.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:28:47
No offense but with such a sizable investment you probably should have stored your coins somewhere in your control so that they're not at the mercy of an exchange. And contacted the exchanges *before* you tried to cash out $2.5 million.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:35:06
No more possible than getting your coins on the main chain stolen
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:22:36
I hope you're joking
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:33:48
As long as one copy of the blockchain survives. So does everyones bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:28:55
Not due to inflation past 2140.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:01:04
Highest fee transactions get in first. Once the high fee transactions go through, the lower ones do. As you can see around 14:40 a few 10 sat/byte went through because there were no more high fee transactions left.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:28:47
Yes. I see that as a real threat for bitcoin at the moment.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:10:56
Because the mainstream media is uneducated about new technology. They don't bother to actually research anything before they tell the world what they should think.
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:15:55
You store $1 million in an online wallet/exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:13:49
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:14:14
And custom
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:13:44
This is only 1 scaling method. If Lightning Network does not scale enough then we introduce additional scaling methods. Whether that be an increased block size, layer 3 or 4, or some other scaling method.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:00:23
By using the lightning network, you're moving transactions that would be on layer 1 to layer 2, thus freeing up space on layer 1 for opening/closing channels.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:13:53
No you can limit trade with 0 fees too
@_date: 2017-12-04 05:40:51
What kind of protections?
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:43:14
It means there are 2^128 different 12 word seeds.
I.E. A very large number.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:55:48
You're probably safe until you get a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:30:56
They'll probably try, I don't see it succeeding though.
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:42:26
It is mathematically impossible to calculate the private key from the public key.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:29:31
Because when you buy your coins aren't transfered through the bitcoin network, they go through the exchanges centralized system.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:07:04
The blockchain contains the information that says "X public key contains Y bitcoin". Everyone knows this as it is on the blockchain, however in order to do anything with those bitcoins, you need to have the private key. The receiver has the private key for the public key you sent those bitcoin to, so only they are able to spend it.
Not sure if this answers your question or not.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:09:32
Yeah that is unrelated 
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:45:28
 &gt; Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.
Sorry no it won't work.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:19:14
Then pester them until they cooperate. Talk to a lawyer or something. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:34:35
Some will die. Some will become currencies for niche markets/uses.
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:05:10
You could also see if there are any bitcoin atms near you, but some of them have a pretty big price markup.

Check out the sidebar -&gt;
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:28:35
The thin lines show the high/lows of that candle while the thick bar is the total gains/losses. It just means someone sold really low for whatever reason

I thought it was jan 1st
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:55:22
As far as paper, I would think cardstock would be good. But the best wallet would be to stamp your private key into metal.
@_date: 2017-12-13 03:36:58
You only have to worry about taxes when you sell.
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:55:52
An institution can fire up a LN node just like literally anyone else. It's no different than setting up a full node in that regard.
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:56:27
I think they only accept 100 per hour
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:08:49
Yes. *Never* store your seed online. That is the number 1 no-no when it comes to bitcoin.
Write it down and store it like you would any other important document. Like in a safe box or something.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:22:55
There is literally zero benefit to paying the high fee on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:03:23
Probably. But is that any different than the last 3 months?
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:07:18
Miners get transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:58:59
Honestly it's up to personal preference. They're both great wallets.
I got the ledger nano because it's concise and looks like a usb drive. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:00:40
You need to send it to an exchange that supports BCH, sell your BTC for BCH, and then send your BCH wherever you need it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:45:18
*Casually opening my phone to 18 more notifications*
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:03:56
Depends on what wallet you're using. Usually you right click on the transaction and there is a 'Forget this transaction' or something.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:30:57
A proper full node takes an ass load of bandwidth. You can still play games on it and stuff but I run one and it transfers about 150-200 gb a day

We're definitely still in early adopters.

Let's wait to see what lightning network can do
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:49:18
Miners get transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:29:04
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:30:02
Well segwit was the first optimization, which was required for lightning network. Now we're on the verge of lightning network. Even with that we may need another solution or simply a block size increase. However I think increasing the block size should be a last resort.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:43:01
You're thinking too hard, the people running bitcoin futures don't think this hard.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:03:55
I don't believe the Ledger Nano S supports that yet. But I would be delighted to be proven wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:15:57
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:44:08
Lightning network is on its way. Instant payments.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:18:36
Just wait for transaction fees to go down. Lightning network still may be months away.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:36:49
When looking at the blockchain, all of your receiving addresses will look as though they have no relation to each other.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:23:32


You what now?
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:05:43
1. You'll have to buy off exchanges, as exchanges are subject to KYC laws so they require your SSN and such. You can meet up with people willing to sell and they can send bitcoin to an address you can manually generate. Just sit down with a coin and flip it 256 times, write down a 1 for heads and a 0 for tails. This is your private key. From there you can calculate the public key. This involves some math, but google is your friend. After a little googling I found [this bitcointalk thread]( As for finding people to buy coins from, you could try [localbitcoins]( I've never used it but you can supposedly find people in your area to meet up with and pay for bitcoin in cash. You could also see if there are any bitcoin ATMs in your area. Just input cash and your address and it will send you coins. No identification needed.
2. Your wallet *is* your private key. What you have is what's called a paper wallet. You can see an example of computer-assisted paper wallet generation [here]( As for exchanges, you can forget that if you want this level of security. All (legal) exchanges are subject to KYC laws which requires them to know *exactly* who you are. Exchanges kind of defeat the purpose of bitcoin in a lot of ways but that's what happens when new tech attracts investors I guess.
3. If you go full computer-less for coin storage, I would recommend you keep a small amount of coins in a hot-wallet, keeping the bulk of your coins in your paper wallet. Because let's be honest, making transactions using this method is really annoying.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:29:14
As far as I'm aware - You cannot do this with a ledger.
When I say exact same, I mean *exact*. Your transaction must contain the same inputs as the old one in order to invalidate the old transaction. Otherwise you'll just be sending the coins twice.
This requires you to tell your wallet to forget about that old transaction, which you cannot do with the ledger wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:37:29
Depends on how confident you are that your computer is safe
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:50:13
Use a program like speccy to check temps. Anything over 80°C should probably be fixed. Anything over 90°C turn it off now.
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:18:51
If a miner controls 51% of the nodes, *only* those 51% will accept the block. The other 49% will see that block and reject it. 
This is how hardforks happen.

Because I'm selling my $32 billion in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:42:15
Coinbase is indeed simpler, but the fees are pretty high so it's worth looking into GDAX next time.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:05:07
I think you provided the wrong transaction ID. That transaction ID is the one from receiving your initial balance.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:03:58
What comparison can you even make between bitcoin and tulips?
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:20:33
We don't know that yet.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:48:15
Use any of the wallets bitcoin.org recommends.
I would personally recommend electrum.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:08:35
Just select whatever you selected before.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:32:57
Not going to happen.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:11:15
This is no 1 universal price of bitcoin. It's different on each exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:53:47
From the view of the blockchain, 2 addresses in the same wallet are completely unrelated. The only thing you can determine with reasonable certainty is the creation of a change address, you can assume 2 addresses are related when a change address is created.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:53:03
Please no
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:21:34
Is this what the moon feels like?
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:16:40
Your private key is a random number between 0 and 2^256 - 1. 
You can generate your public key from your private key and send coins to that. 
You can also sign your transactions offline using your private key and broadcast them to the network from an internet-connected device without exposing your private key.
This is of course only necessary for the most paranoid of people, but it's a hell of alot safer than using another banking system, which likely uses intel cpus and are vulnerable to the exploit you mentioned. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:56:07
Is there a wallet.dat?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:42:09
As long as one copy of the blockchain survives, so does bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:35:17
Because you can bet on the price of bitcoin going down.
If the price goes down and you only hold bitcoin, you don't benefit. But if the price goes down and you bet on bitcoin going down, then you profit. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:06:32
Yeah you can track large scale mining operations based on energy consumption. But not all bitcoin mining is large scale.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:26:54
Yeah. You can try a few over at 
EDIT: It actually appears to be down at the moment, maybe try later.
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:29:29
Probably not.
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:19:38
Sounds like you didn't make big enough swap file.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:35:56
If half the network stopped mining righ now for whatever reason. You would be correct in saying transactions would take longer and fees would go up. This will only last a short while though, because every 2016 blocks the network difficulty is adjusted and it will drop due to less people mining.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:21:42
When the price spikes like bitcoin tends to do, It's generally considered an unhealthy price gain and it won't sustain itself as the price is very volatile. So when the price goes back down after a recent spike it's called a correction.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:55:46
I wouldn't count on it. It's definitely possible though.  
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:43:27
Please read the rules before posting:


@_date: 2017-12-01 08:09:43
Transactions are now measured based on a 'weight' system. So there is a weight limit, not a data limit. I'm not exactly sure how it works beyond that though.
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:30:42
No. The difficulty will always target 10 minute blocks. No matter how many miners or nodes there are.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:19:33
Interesting. This is something I did not know you could do.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:12:22

The balances at every address is 100% public knowledge. When you tell coinbase to send coins to an address, they can assume that is your address.
The ledger also generates a new address every time you receive coins.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:17:45
I'm not sure. I've seen this happen sometimes but I don't know why it happens. You could try right clicking the transaction in bitcoin core and click "Forget transaction" and send it again.

No address needed. Just enter the seed into and BIP39 compatable wallet and it will recover all of your addresses and bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-12-01 05:08:04
Actually a lot of people care what they have to say. It's why everyone doesn't have bitcoin today.
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:08:35
That is not bitcoin, that is coinbase. They bloat their prices so they can make money on top of the fee they slap on it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:38:26
What makes you think that?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:05:35

The *only* part of what I said above done on an internet connected device is broadcasting the transaction, which contains no revealing information about your private key or the transactions origin (IP address or otherwise).
It is impossible to know the origin of any transaction on the network as each and every node on the network relays the transaction in the exact same way you initially broadcasted it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:41:20
Every time you receive bitcoin, it creates a UXTO. When you send bitcoin it needs to include these UXTOs in the transaction, which takes space.
If you have a lot of UXTOs your transaction will be large.
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:37:54
Well he could but 12 words is still alot of security. So I'd say you're safe. If you're paranoid you could just make a new wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:16:53
No. The size of the transaction is the exact same no matter how many addresses you use.

Not that I'm aware. They just like to trick new users into buying bitcoin cash instead of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:54:15
Currently there isn't much of a reason to buy things with bitcoin. It does however help increase bitcoin adoption and further separates us from the banks. So until the price of bitcoin levels out I would recommend buying stuff with bitcoin when you can and then turn around and buy the same amount you just spent (or more)
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:20:36
No, because the virus will say "Hey wallet, give me your coins" and the wallet will say "No". 
Now if you're talking about making a transaction like the client does, the virus will say "Hey wallet, make this transaction" and the wallet will say "Sure, let me just ask the user for confirmation" and it will give you a confirmation prompt on the device like it does whenever you make a transaction.

Not without knowing the network difficulty and what people are paying for fees. The last bitcoin is going to be mined around 2140 so we really don't know what the state of bitcoin will be like then.

Bitcoin does not require more power the larger the network gets.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:26:29
What? This makes no sense. Miners cannot add falsified transactions to the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:49:14
Then learn. You have an entire internet at your disposal here.
Once you've learned, decide if you want to buy any. Then you'll have some.

If coinbase and bitcoin gets big enough (with government approval), the government might bail them out like they did with the banks, but coinbase will not get any sympathy from bitcoin users, devs, and the blockchain itself.

Coinbase doesn't tell you the address they keep your coins at. Coinbase actually pools all of their customers coins into one (or a few) addresses. So if you transfer coins out of coinbase you'll see they come from a completely different address.

Yeah I can see how it might be difficult to get a fiat system setup, and they might want to see a functioning exchange before they open business with you. So if fiat trading isn't a launch feature, at least don't "wait for traction" to implement fiat trading.

The network is really congested at the moment. We're all waiting to see if Lightning network will solve this.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:41:00
Segwit transactions have 4x less weight than a legacy transaction. So if every transaction was a segwit transaction, the network could handle 4x more transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:13:22
At least 7

Yeah this is definitely a scam
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:25:51
Theoretically you'd pay 4x less than if every transaction was non-segwit
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:57:03
This is actually very interesting. I wish they would supply more details. Like is it open source? Can anyone run a node? Why would you use this cryptocurrency over another?

You're WAYYYY too late for that. About 9 years too late.

To answer your original question though. Cryptocurrencies are a basically completely unregulated market and anything goes. If you really want to manipulate the market you totally could, there's nothing illegal about it.
That being said, some exchanges do have some rules against market manipulation techniques. For instance, bittrex has taken steps to prevent market manipulation and I believe some people have had their accounts locked because of it. 
Just be careful out there friend.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:01:56
Is that not exactly what I just said?
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:18:01
Yeah it's relative. To the traditional investor though, they're not used to seeing more than a couple percent change over a year or so. So when they see 10%+ price change in a half day, that looks really volatile.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:00:24
What the fuck
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:40:16
To answer your question - There is no transaction so nothing will happen on the blockchain. But you can load your private key into any wallet and spend from there. The private key allows you to spend the bitcoin at that address, no matter what wallet it is in.

People will still mine, just not to the point of having massive mining farms eating loads of electricity.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:48:30
The fee is dependent on the size of the transaction *in bytes*. So a transaction with more inputs/outputs would result in a higher fee.
@_date: 2017-12-14 17:19:03

Because in order for your computer to get information from, well, anything - It needs to request that information from the device. Whether it's your hard drive requesting a specific piece of information, or a flash drive, or a server on the other side of the world.
If your computer says "Hey wallet, give me that private key", the wallet will straight up refuse the request.

Rule 


@_date: 2017-12-02 22:38:26
You're thinking of UXTOs (Unconfirmed Transaction Outputs) I believe. In that scenario you need to send 1 transaction with 10 inputs and 1 or more outputs. I guess you can send 10 individual transactions if you really wanted to, but fees are a thing.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:11:02
Yet you provide no details whatsoever 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:10:55
Basically. Take the features that are compatible with bitcoin and are 100% tested and safe.
Take ethereum and their smart contracts for example. That jr developer poking around the code a few weeks ago managed to accidentally destroy millions of dollars in ethereum.
I'm not saying ethereum is bad, I'm saying altcoins are where the innovation happens. So that if there's a problem it harms that altcoin instead of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:35:28
Yes but you put the dollar amount
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:04:26
Then don't let your private key ever touch your computer. Simple.

If GDAX had an issue with this they would have stopped it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:41:15
It takes up to 10 days for the transaction to go through and it should show the transaction as pending in your coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:34:21
The blockchain would be preserved on thousands of hard drives across the world. You'd just have to get mining started again
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:30:24
I see you have a couple other coins listed there, are you open to suggestions for other altcoins?
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:29:05
Bitcoin is not coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:03:26
GDAX pays the fee for you. There isn't even an option to include the fee.
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:37:09
That really sucks dude. Did you have a backup?

Segwit is currently more usable than legacy. I still wouldn't make transactions now if you don't have to.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:34:52
Do your research. Many people here are going to say fuck BCH, but that doesn't really answer your question.
My advice: Do your research and invest accordingly.

Probably the windows installer. The standalone is more for running on a flash drive or something.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:17:55
Your GDAX transaction operated entirely within GDAXs system. It is not decentralized, verifiable, trustless, or irreversible.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:44:45
If the bitcoin network can currently support 5 tx per second, then after LN the network can support 5 channel open/close per second. And each channel can support any arbitrary amount of transactions. 
Correct me if I'm wrong but this sounds like a major improvement. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:47:12

@_date: 2017-12-02 05:58:29
Send another transaction to an address you control with a higher fee
Edit: I should say cancel the first transaction first, your second transaction must contain one of the same UXTOs as your first one.

@_date: 2017-12-12 08:34:12
But keep in mind, given how big this exploit is - You could say the same thing for almost any other computer system. All encryption can be broken using this exploit. Which is what cryptocurrencies and any other banking system relies on.
Honestly I'm surprised this isn't getting more press. But it might be good it's not getting press. The less people know about it, the better. Your average computer user is not going to be able to do anything about it anyway.

Bitcoin is not a stock
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:56:50
The last bitcoin will be mined in 2140, not 2040.
Also miners get transaction fees as an incentive.

That transaction should just disappear from your wallet and your coins will be back. They technically never left your wallet, your wallet just locks them so you can't double-spend.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:46:18

Yes you can totally run linux on a usb! A couple quick google searches revealed [this guide]( which looks pretty good. But if you're not familiar with linux, this might not be the best option as it can be easy to fuck stuff up on linux.
As for reinstalling windows: 
Grab the Windows 10 media creation tool over [here](
Grab a usb drive at least 8gb (maybe you can do 4gb idk).
Open the windows 10 media creation tool and follow the prompts to install the windows 10 boot media on the usb drive.
Shut off the computer and boot into the bios (you should need to press one of the function keys while it's starting up, it's usually F2, F9, F10, or F12. You should be able to look up the key for your laptop online).
This part is going to require you to do some searching around the menus as every bios is different. So use the arrow keys and the enter key to search for a way to boot boot into your usb drive. The usb is normally named something that includes the manufacturer name in it. So if it's a Lexar usb drive, it's probably named Lexar something.
Once you're booted into the installation media, just follow prompts for installing windows and you should be good to go.

There were several bugs in the code. I think what did it was there was an off-by-one error in the block creation code so the miners were trying to make a 2 mb block early, but the block validation code did not have the same off-by-one error. So a block was getting made and then immediately getting rejected for being over 1 mb.

I'm sorry, I seem to have been reading this wrong.
0.1 btc was sent to this address and then it was sent out to 2 addresses. This is probably coinbase managing its addresses, which makes it difficult to look at from a blockchain standpoint. It is also one reason why I don't use coinbase (because stuff like this happens).
I would contact coinbase.

I think you can import the private keys into electrum without downloading the blockchain.
Head over [here]( and download electrum. Then go over to your bitcoin core address list and copy an address. Go to the bitcoin core console and type 'dumpprivkey &lt;paste address here&gt;'. Grab that and head over to electrum. Go to the wallet tab &gt; Private keys &gt; import &gt; paste your address.
Then rinse and repeat for the rest of your addresses.
You could also just let the blockchain sync all 150gb
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:08:59
Let me try explaining it a different way.
The blockchain is a building full of doors. Some of the doors have money inside of them. Some do not. Corresponding to each and every door there is a key that unlocks the door, and there is a door for every possible key.
This building full of doors is as you can imagine giant, and really hard to navigate. So what people do is they get curators to handle accessing those doors for them. These curators are what you would call a wallet. 
Now you you want to spend some money, so you tell your curator to go to your door and take some money from it and put it in a little mailbox slot of another door. This is a transaction. But in order for your curator to open your door, they need the key. So you hand over your private key. Your curator can then go perform the transaction.
Now lately you haven't liked how your curator is doing their job for whatever reason. This would be like you not wanting to sync your wallet. So you want to switch to another. You get a new curator and want to make a transaction. Once again, your curator requires the key to open your door. So you hand over your private key, the exact same way you gave your last curator your key.
Notice how the same thing happens no matter what curator has your key. Money is removed from your door and placed in someone elses. The blockchain does not care who does the transferring, it only cares about how much money is behind each door.

Your 15 coins did not impact the market like you thought it did. It was a coincidence that the price did what it did. Just look on GDAX, they have a 30,000 BTC volume today alone, and 15 coins is not going to move a market that big.

Your first statement is accurate.
If the user wants to send coins to a wallet they control the keys for, and that wallet does not have any channels associated with it - Coinbase can do 2 things. They can pay to open a channel with the new wallet and send the coins over the lightning network, or they can just send the coins over the mainnet.
I'd imagine that mainnet settlement would not be something the average user would need to do every day, but it would be good to settle channels every once in a while.

Yeah that's probably it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:23:40
Worst case scenario, your transaction drops out of the mempool after a few days and you can spend your coins again.
You can send the same transaction again with a higher fee and it will replace the old one essentially. Make sure you're sending the *same* transaction though (IE make sure you tell your wallet to forget about the old one). 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:55:30
You could also just ask your question here.

What did you expect when you entered an exchange of any kind? They exist to facilitate a moving volume of money where a practical use is not yet dominant. 
When you invest in crypto not intending to day trade, you invest in the technology. You're investing so that in the future bitcoin might have enough traction to displace fiat currency. You're investing for the day that exchanges like GDAX won't exist because bitcoin isn't just a store of value, it's a currency.

You don't get your keys from the exchange. You generate those yourself, the exchange just sends you your coins.
Saying you get your keys from the exchange is like saying you want to pay someone, so instead of sending them money you just give them the bank account. It's just not how it works.

The senario you presented included a brand new wallet which doesn't have any channels open with it. If a wallet has at least 1 channel open, then it is likely that you could get payment there by hopping everywhere.
The difference between an IOU and lightning coins is that if you want to claim an IOU you need to rely on someone to pay you what it states on the IOU. With lightning coins you can manually close the channel, and since channels are 'pre-loaded' with coins - payment is completed on the main chain without requiring anything of whoever you have that channel open with.

Since when has anything in this world not been about making as much money as fast as possible?
Also just think about it: Cryptocurrency is a day traders dream world. It's completely unregulated. Exchange operation is *lightning* fast. And it's pure market watch, no bullshit 'insider' information or anything.
If you really want to be someone who day trade with bots - then day trade with bots. There's nothing stopping you. There are plenty of free, open source, and example bots out there that you can play around with in test markets and such.
That's the wonder of cryptocurrency. Nothing is stopping you.

Is it that the network can only support 40 million users? Because that's a hell of alot higher than it can now.
In you example above you said the network can handle 157 million tx/year. That's ~80 million users opening/closing 1 channel per year, but making as many transactions as they want on it OR 80 million users making 2 transactions per year.
I don't know about you, but I make significantly more than 2 transactions per year. Having a LN channel open means I can make as many transactions as I want.

Thing is - We don't know if we'll need bigger blocks in the future. If we do it should be implemented as it is needed and not before. Usually preparation for the future is good, but in this case it is not.
It would be different if increasing the blocksize is inevitable, but we don't know if it is inevitable.

Well 1 satoshi is 1/100,000,000th of a bitcoin so you take the price of a bitcoin ($7280 on GDAX right now) and divide it by 100,000,000.

@_date: 2017-11-15 22:08:08
I'll respond because nobody else in this thread is giving helpful responses.
Bitcoin core (in it's current state) does not have the scaling capacity as bitcoin cash. I hope people can agree on that.
However increasing the block size is only a linearly scalable solution. What bitcoin core is doing is working on an exponentially scalable solution (side chains). It's not ready yet but when it is bitcoin core **will** be more scalable than bitcoin cash.
At the moment, bitcoin core is only coasting on it's developers reputation, the bitcoin name, the market state, and the ambition of it's scaling solution.

First of all - Don't kill yourself. It just is not a good idea no matter how big of a hole you feel you're in.
As for your friends behavior - This isn't something specific to bitcoin. Let me explain my thoughts on what's happening:
Sometimes people find themselves in a hole of just not knowing where they belong. These people tend to latch on to the first culture they find, and reorganize their life around that. 
Your friend found bitcoin and saw the potential in it. His beliefs were only strengthened by the value of bitcoin going up this last year. What it sounds like is you served as someone who listened to his ramblings about bitcoin, even if you didn't necessarily care. Maybe you we're the only person he had to talk bitcoin to about, maybe everyone else already dismissed him. I'm not saying this is probable, but it's definitely possible.
People are weird. We start to feel possessive over strong beliefs we hold. When you started to dismiss bitcoin. He felt the need to defend his possession, his belief.
As for what you should do - it depends on your relationship with him. It might be best to just not contact him again. You could reach out to him and try to explain that you're not in a position to invest yet. 
There is no need to rush this situation. Just take your time and think over the best course of action.
I hope this is helpful.

Most of those units are really obscure and I've never heard them in the wild. Just remember:

- Milli-bitcoin (mBTC) = 1/1,000th of a bitcoin
- Micro-bitcoin (μBTC) = 1/1,000,000 of a bitcoin

Lets say you buy 1 bitcoin from coinbase. Coinbase is basically saying "We'll do whatever you tell us to do with this 1 bitcoin." Coinbase is pretty good with this, but you don't actually 'own' your coins. What if coinbase goes out of buisness? Then you're fucked.
So if you buy off coinbase and then send it to a wallet you have the private keys for, then you actually own your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:52:57
That's a change address. You are unable to have a partial UXTO as an input, so what it does is it creates a new address (the one you're seeing, the change address) and sends coins to that address as well as the one you wanted to send to.

What I think is happening is every mining payout you get it sent to a new address, and when you transfer coins the transaction contains a ton of input addresses and 1 output address. I believe you can send your coins to a single address to reduce the size of future transactions, and start getting mining payouts to a single address, maybe changing addresses every once in a while to maintain security.

234 sats/byte is the default for mycelium at the moment. You did not change the fee.
Mycelium will allow you to go all the way down to 1 sat/byte regardless of the transaction.

Probably about a week, if at all.
I would do a 2 sat/byte transaction. It has a significantly  higher chance of being confirmed.

The trezor holds your private keys and signs your transactions with those private keys. When you use the web interface, the trezor will send your public keys to the computer, and the conputer will look up how many coins are at those public keys. Your trezor does not know how many coins are on it as it only stores your keys.
The whole point of the trezor is that your private keys never leave the trezor.

Your phone/computer is connected to the internet. This means there is a risk you can be hacked and your bitcoin stolen. With a hardware wallet your keys are never exposed to the computer it's connected to and therefore never touches the internet.

1. You can use different [units]( of bitcoin. For example millibitcoin (mBTC) seems to be catching on.
2. I think many altcoins will die, and the ones that survive will be used in their own niche. And will always be valued in respect to bitcoin.

Coinbase is not a wallet where you actually *own* your coins. Coinbase just says "we'll do whatever you tell us to do with this bitcoin" but they are ultimately in control of those coins. If you want 100% control over your coins, use a wallet you control the keys for like electrum or something.

There are no safeguards. If you generate a private key it could very well be satoshis. It's just that 2^256 is such a massive number it's so hard to comprehend its magnitude. There is a higher chance I can smash my face on my keyboard and get your bank account login than there is there will ever be 2 people that get the same private key.

I'm just going to copy-paste a response I made to [this same question]( just an hour ago:


How do we solve this though? Side chains.
By migrating transactions off the main chain, you can slow the growth of the blockchain considerably AND dramatically increase the volume of transactions that can be made worldwide.
Now I'm not exactly sure how the specifics work as to how you can securely perform off-chain transactions, but it's still in development and I don't believe the core devs are stupid enough to make a change that would jeopardize the integrity of a $122 billion market. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:34:06
at least 7

Depends on how you bought. If it was a bank transfer it will take up to 10 days. If it was with a credit card it should be instant, but they've been under some extreme load today. So it can take longer.

Quite the whitepaper you got there.

Why do you want to transfer to coinbase and then transfer it right back out?
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:51:36
Yeah, they left some crucial details out. But everything there is technically accurate, to an extent.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:51:21
I like that calculation much better. Keep in mind the bitcoin network does not require more miners as the network grows. If everyone stopped mining right now, I could mine all the blocks on my phone after the difficulty adjustment kicked in and still process the same number of transactions. All we can do is hope mining becomes less profitable in the future as the block reward goes down, so less people will mine.

The fee is determined by the transaction size *in bytes*, not the amount you're sending. So you could send a billion dollar transaction for a $2 fee.

Blocks contain transactions. So when you mine a block, that block contains transactions, and when a transaction is put inside a block it is considered 'confirmed'.

The network fee is a set fee, but I'm sure coinbase adds their own fee and I'm not sure if its set or a percentage. Either way, if you want your coins out of coinbase you have to take the fee anyway.

@_date: 2017-11-27 00:32:22
No, GDAX cannot pay the fee because the receiver cannot pay the transaction fee. That would be extremely exploitable, I could send a 0.1 btc transaction to you and make you pay a 300 btc transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:06:00
I wouldn't think coinbase would care about you sending coins to a gambling site. I think it's likely it's a coincidence.
Is it only eth that's locked?
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:57:40
The market will likely have some massive movements around the time of the fork, nobody knows which way though.
Also be sure to be clear on the difference between segwit and segwit2x. Segwit has already happened and it was a soft fork, segwit2x is a hard fork in about 10 days.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:13:19
I don't really have a predicted endpoint, but I know it will be well over 10k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:08:36
That's not coinbase. That is some completely unrelated website.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:22:18
I'm not very knowledgeable about this, but as far as I'm aware - only a few of the ~100 bitcoin developers are employed by blockstream. Some people may see this as an issue but let me ask you this: There are several Intel employees that are working on the linux kernel, does that mean Intel controls linux development? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:39:24
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:37:18
That happens ever 1k
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:45:31
It only hit 10k on some exchanges
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:27:29
It was that flash dip a few days ago.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:21:33


Don't do this
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:27:00
I assume it would be adapted into loaning cryptocurrencies instead of fiat.
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:20:33
Yes this is normal. Every time you recieve it generates a new address. However all of your old addresses are still valid.
@_date: 2017-11-01 20:06:59
Bitcoin does not care who you are, who you buy it from might however (exchanges usually do). You could also buy it in person with localbitcoins or at a bitcoin atm.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:20:01
Nope, I bought with a bank transfer through coinbase. I still don't even have the coins.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:36:23
How fast it gets to your wallet depends on the fee it was sent with. Do you have the transaction id? You can get a rough estimate on when you'll get it based on the transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-11-04 00:29:55
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:03:14
Anyone can view all transactions and all address balances. But unless there is something linking you to that address, then you remain completely anonymous as nobody knows who owns that address.

Because we already know it's a problem and we're patiently waiting on a solution. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:47:48
Coinbase is supported but GDAX isnt?
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:39:22
No it means the size of the transaction is 225 bytes, it says you paid 79 sat/byte.
It should confirm rather quickly
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:05:12
The network is congested, everyone is having issues. Worst case scenario, your transaction drops out of the mempool and you get your coins back.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:53:58
What the fuck
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:05:45
I think it's quite stupid they require that. But yes, it is safe.

Don't worry about segwit2x, officially it was canceled but a small group has decided to go through with it anyway.

Quite the notification bar you have there

Just mine the coins and hold them. The coins you mine will also grow in value.

GDAX has zero withdraw fees.

Have you tried buying more?
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:44:26
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:54:46
Yes it is still possible, however if it does happen there will be significantly less support and the chain will die.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:03:31
Bank transfer takes up to 10 days, credit card is instant but has higher fees.
@_date: 2017-11-09 07:55:29
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:42:19
Nope you're all good
The segwit2x fork is unrelated to segwit
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:32:38
You can right click the transaction and click forget. Then you can resend the transaction with a higher fee. Both transactions will be in the mempool, but one of them will be put into a block and the other one will be thrown out.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:48:37
I'm not exactly sure how decentralized exchanges work. But I believe they use a form of atomic swaps. One that is not enforced by the algorithm, but by the exchange platform.

That's how dips happen

When it comes to the ledger and trezor, you really can't go wrong with either one. I got the ledger because it is concise and looks like a usb.

Out of curiosity what payment method are you using? I've never seen a limit so low on coinbase.

If a node sends a block with corrupted or invalid transactions, then the network will reject it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:46:07
Yes it is technically an IOU until you transfer your coins out of coinbase to your own wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:45:12
Probably. You just gotta pony up for the initial cost, and you've gotta have somewhere to put it legally.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:18:07
I wouldn't count on it. There's basically no laws that protect either side of a bitcoin loan.

Tether was hacked and 31 mil was sent to an unknown address. Later 15 mil was sent to a known bitfinex address and the drop happened around then.

@_date: 2017-11-28 17:03:37
They say 2-4 days but in my experience it's more like 7-10, just like coinbase. 
If you do limit orders there are zero fees.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:27:56
If you bought with a bank account and not a credit card then it is. It can take up to 10 days.

Nobody needs to request the transaction. When you request, all it does is generate a new address and when you put an amount it changes the QR code to automatically fill the amount field of the person scanning it.

Well then bitcoin isn't for you then.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:40:11
The 10 minute block interval was selected to reduce the amount of orphan blocks. Also this has the same effect as increasing the block size essentially.

Yes, you get an equal amount of bitcoin cash as you had bitcoin at the time of the fork. You're all good.

Coinbase has a transaction fee for transfering out. But if you deposit to GDAX first and then withdraw from there, they pay the transaction fee for you. So you will receive exactly what you bought.

Coinbase credit card transactions are instant.
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:43:26
Write it down and keep it somewhere safe, that only you have access to. The hardware wallet will be protected by a pin. **Don't** write this down, memorize it. The wallet is useless without it. If you forget the pin or lose/break the wallet, you can restore your coins using your seed in any wallet that supports mnemonics. 
So your seed is more valuable than the wallet itself.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:17:12
Coinbase will combine multiple transactions into one to save on fees. It just means someone else it transfering 8 btc somewhere.
@_date: 2017-11-10 17:40:08
You can transfer them to GDAX and withdraw from there with no fees

If you bought bitcoin on coinbase (not depositing fiat), then your price is locked in at what you bought at.
So if you buy at 10.5k and by the time the purchase goes through it's 11k. You'll get coins at the lower price.

It uses an average transaction fee and then they add I believe 1.49% rounded up to the nearest dollar.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:18:22

There has been a spike of transactions and not enough space in the blocks. The devs are working on the lightning network, which makes it so you don't have to cram every transaction on the main chain.

Many altcoins are still worth mining, I would do some research for what you want to mine. You could also use nicehash, which picks altcoins for you and pays you in bitcoin.

Nodes that don't have the whole blockchain will accept them. For instance, electrum will blindly accept the transaction and appear as unconfirmed before eventually disappearing.

Decreasing block time decreases the amount of time a newly made block has to fully propagate through the network. 
Lets say you have 1 node which mines a block and sends it out into the network. 5 minutes later, the last node on the network receives the block, and starts working on the next one. If you decrease the block time to - lets say - 2 minutes, A node would send out a block and because it takes 5 minutes for the block to make it all the way through the network, a node on the other side of the network may also mine one and send it out before even hearing about the one that has already been mined. Now you have 2 competing blocks in the network. Most of the time, the network will instantly reject the block - an orphan block, but sometimes the blocks we're mined close enough together you can get a split in nodes, one following one block and the other following the other block - This is a fork.
In short this is a means of network security, and 10 minutes was selected as a happy medium between low orphans/forks and a fast network.

well bitcoin isn't physical either. And I'm not advocating for bitcoin cash but the whitepaper does specifically say "electronic cash"
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:08:05
Only if someone who knows your address can link you to that address. For instance, if you buy bitcoin on an exchange that requires you to verify your address and then you transfer bitcoin to an address, that exchange can assume that you own that address.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:51:30
Lightning network should solve this
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:15:43
There can be softfork upgrades which don't require a fork. There can also be hardfork upgrades, and the network has to agree on it for the new fork to succeed.

@_date: 2017-11-14 23:17:22
That is not at all a loaded question, thank you for asking!
Currently the max block size is 1mb and you can fit about 2500 transactions in a block on average. Lately we've been hitting that limit a lot so fees go up.
Bitcoin cash went with the most obvious solution to just increase the block limit to 8mb (and 32mb if necessary) so in theory you can make 8x more transactions per block than the main chain. The issue with this is that the blockchain now can grow at 8x the rate. The current ~160 gb blockchain is already really big and growing fast too, but this basically makes it 8x more of a problem.
Why is this a problem? Bitcoin is supposed to be decentralized, and if the blockchain is so big people can't run it in their own home, then that would leave only miners and corporations running nodes. They could more easily perform a 51% attack and take down the network.
Another issue with larger blocks is that because the blocks are larger, it places more strain on nodes in the network. It takes longer to receive, transmit, and verify those blocks. Meaning it takes longer for a block to propagate through the network, thus you get more orphan blocks and forks. An unstable network is an unhealthy network.
Bitcoin core is currently working on the lightning network, which allows you to make transactions off the main chain. Essentially (without getting into the technical detail) you tell the blockchain you want to open a 'channel' with another person. Transactions can now be made freely between those 2 people without telling the blockchain and without fees. When the one of the 2 people want to close the channel, they tell the blockchain they're closing the channel and a transaction is made of the sum of all bitcoin transacted between those 2 people.

I would recommend getting a ledger nano s or a trezor. They're both rather small and the ledger nano s looks more like a usb drive while the trezor is more identifiable. The idea is you need to connect them to a computer to spend but the private keys never leave the device, so your computer could be completely infected and your bitcoin will remain safe.

If you log into gdax (same login as coinbase), on the left side there's an option to deposit from your coinbase account. Do that and then withdraw your bitcoin to your hardware wallet. The reason you want to do this instead of withdrawing directly from coinbase is gdax pays your fee for you.

Extend the observation period.
If you have a Bitcoin (BTC) balance on Bittrex during the Segwit2x hard fork block 494,784 occurring in mid-November, you will be additionally credited the equivalent amount of chain split tokens on a 1:1 basis. i.e. 1 BTC on Bittrex held during the on-exchange snapshot will get you 1 chain split token. BTC held on orders will also be credited. Only the BTC held on your account is eligible for chain split tokens.

Miners get paid the transaction fees of the transactions included in the block they just made. And the first person to find a valid hash for the next block gets to 'mine' it, take the transaction fees, and 12.5 bitcoin out of thin air.
I would watch [this]( video, it explains alot.

Bitcoin can be expressed out to 8 decimal places, so there are actually 2.1 quadrillion individual units of bitcoin. And I believe this can be changed in the future to move the decimal place back (whether that's a hard/soft fork idk)

If you boradcast a btc transaction, that transaction is also valid on the s2x chain. Essentially when you send one coin, you're also sending the other. So if you send you're s2x coins to an exchange to sell them, you just lost all of youe btc as well.

Bitcoin cash is solving the scaling problem by increasing block size. This solution only scales linearly over time, and causes the blockchain to rapidly grow in size to sizes nobody wants on their home computer, leading to centralization because only miners and corporations can afford the storage necessary.
Bitcoin is solving the scaling problem with sidechains. That way not every transaction has to be made on the main chain, leading to a slower growing blockchain. Transactions are only made on the main chain when side chains decide to close and 'square up'.

All wallets work like this. The ledger just asks you to confirm it.
Lets say you receive 1 btc.
That 1 btc is stored in an Unconfirmed Transaction Output (UXTO).
Lets say you want to send 0.2 btc somewhere.
You cannot have the transaction look like this:
Your Address(1btc) -&gt; Output Address(1btc)
Because UXTOs cannot be split, you would be sending 1 btc to the output address instead of 0.2.
You CAN however do this:
Your Address(1btc) -&gt; Output Address(0.2btc) + Change Address(0.8btc)

In that case, if you have the bandwidth - Consider running a full node to help support the network. You already downloaded bitcoin core and the blockchain so all you have to do is forward port 8333 on your router.

Difficulty is how hard it is to find the hash of the next block, and difficulty increases as the total hashrate of the network increases (higher hashrate generally means higher power consumption). Currently the hashrate of the network is ~7.6 exahashes at a difficulty of 1.3 trillion. If the hashrate goes down (people stopped mining) the difficulty would also go down. So if the difficulty was very low, you could reasonably mine with your phone.
I would highly recommend watching this video on how bitcoin works for more information.

- The seed is **more** valuable than your private key, as it is essentially *every* private key in your wallet
- Hardware wallets **do not** run on batteries and must be used in conjunction with a computer you plug it into.
- Your private key is randomly generated. There is no guarantee that nobody has that key already, but you must understand how **extremely** unlikely anyone will **ever** generate the same private key as you. Watch [this]( video for more information.
- The best place to store your wallet depends on your use case. I use mine for minor transactions every once in a while, so I just keep it in my desk drawer. Is this the most secure? Probably not. But if you're looking for the most secure method, I would probably go with a safe only you have access to (IE not a bank).
- Some people take their seed words, split them into chunks, and distribute them to people you trust. Tell them when you die to put the words together to get your bitcoin.
- As for how keys are generated randomly, it depends on the wallet. But you're breaking into a whole branch of mathematics on how to generate random numbers.
- In theory, hardware wallets are just a secure as paper wallets, but it is a device that probably isn't perfect. For instance when trezor was first released there was an exploit that made it possible for someone to retrieve the private keys off of it (which has since been fixed). Probably the most secure way of storing keys is to generate your keys by hand: Sit down with a coin and flip it 256 times. Write down the results, heads = 1, tails = 0 (or the other way around, it doesn't matter). That is your private key.

@_date: 2017-11-03 21:15:48
I bought mine from amazon and haven't had any issues with it. Just make sure to inspect it carefully for tampering before you put any coins on it.

Become comfortable with electrum, it is the way to go.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:55:13
If you're using coinbase, you can deposit it to GDAX (same as coinbase login) and withdraw from there. GDAX will pay your transaction fee.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:49:33
Interesting. There's not many of you windows xp guys left.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:25:53
Your bank will either deny the transaction or it will overdraft
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:56:25
Lightning network allows for transactions to be made off the main chain, Which is currently not possible. In short a channel is "opened" on the blockchain and an unlimited number of transactions can take place on that channel until the channel is closed. When the channel is closed a transaction is made of the sum of all transactions on the channel. It happens like this:
-computer 1 opens channel with computer 2
-computer 1 transfers 0.1 btc to computer 2
-computer 2 transfers 0.25 btc to computer 1
-computer 2 closes the channel
-Transaction of 0.15 btc to computer 1 from computer 2 is made on the blockchain and fees are paid as normal
2 transactions were just made for the price of one
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:37:29
The device checks for tampering every time it starts up and will not work if it is tampered with. You should be totally fine buying from amazon.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:29:59
Yes but what if you can pay to cut in line? And everyone is just cutting you because they pay more?
This is just a bad analogy.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:12:47
Bitcoin does not require tons of power to function.
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:59:53
Well not exactly. They know what address you withdrawed to, so they can track funds at that address. You can make it difficult to track by tranfering it around and through exchanges (which are really just very big addresses that act like a melting pot of sorts) but then that exchange knows where you withdrawed to. There are things called bitcoin tumblers which make it extremely difficuly to track but I've never used one.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:00:47
Many people try to items for bitcoin on craigslist
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:55:03
50 sat/byte should get it confirmed rather quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:03:14
Mainly company error. I trust their security just as much as any other company that stores money. It's just that if the company goes out of buisness or something, you're just as fucked as if you we're to store your coins in the normal wallet. Keep in mind the government won't bail out coinbase if it goes under unlike banks.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:25:39
Depends on how you want to use them.
If you want quick access on the go I would go with Mycelium or breadwallet on mobile.
If you want easy access on a desktop/laptop I would do electrum.
If you want more secure but less easy access on the desktop I would do a nano ledger s or trezor hardware wallet. (costs money)
If you want the most secure, hard to access wallet - go with a paper wallet, which is free. There's ways to generate a paper wallet online/on a computer but the most secure way is to sit down with a piece of paper and randomly write down 256 1s and 0s, that is your private key and your paper wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:55:26
Rule 


@_date: 2017-11-23 05:38:00
Basically it has it's own memory for storing apps and private keys, and it has a very simple processor for signing transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:45:54
The core team is not a company. It is a team of developers operating in an open source community where anyone can contribute.
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:43:48
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:34:59
Worst case scenario, your transaction drops out of the mempool and you get your coins back.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:18:46
An increased block size would definitely mean more transactions could fit in a block, it would also mean the blockchain would grow much faster. The blockchain is already ~160 gb and as the blockchain grows less and less people will want to run it, leaving only people with ample storage being able to run a node. Eventually only big players being able to even run a node, thus - centralization.
How do we solve this though? Side chains.
By migrating transactions off the main chain, you can slow the growth of the blockchain considerably AND dramatically increase the volume of transactions that can be made worldwide.
Now I'm not exactly sure how the specifics work as to how you can securely perform off-chain transactions, but it's still in development and I don't believe the core devs are stupid enough to make a change that would jeopardize the integrity of a $122 billion market.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:44:18
Why wouldn't it be?
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:24:49
Please no
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:28:12
Because they bought into bitcoin cash being promised low transaction fees, now they can't spend it anywhere/convert it back to bitcoin without selling at a loss.
They would benefit from bitcoins failure essentially.
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:59:16
I have no idea. Coinbase might not even know.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:59:55
It removes the security of bitcoin. Transactions are no longer secured by proof of work.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:44:37
Well if you'd like some reassurance just look at what happened to the value of bitcoin right after the bitcoin cash fork
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:27:32
Yes but payments are irreversible and the integrity of payments are proven by the blockchain
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:51:05
Because they would be throwing their reputation down a hole.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:42:35
Wait a few hours and then contact GDAX support
@_date: 2017-11-01 03:07:10
I guess, but there are ways around that. For instance you could send it through an exchange where everyone does not have a unique address. A 'mixing pot' of coins so to speak. And then withdraw them out to another address.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:45:54
Try localbitcoins
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:06:41
Write a poem and use that as the seed
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:42:04
The price listed on the front page is the sell price. Coinbase bloats their buy price, but it tells you what you'll be buying at on the buy page.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:45:33
Not unless you encrypt your wallet (which you should)
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:41:09
They do. I found this in bitcoin new.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:33:14
Noob question, but can't you also charge back a credit card? I've never needed to so I don't know.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:59:02
Just use any computer you have sitting around
@_date: 2017-11-20 07:21:58
Does your wallet not do this for you?
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:03:35
It is against the rules here to ask for free bitcoin
Check the sidebar -&gt;
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:48:53
Yeah but they're insured by the same government that may shut them down in the future.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:05:31
@_date: 2017-11-01 01:38:09
because you don't own your keys, so they're technically not your bitcoin.

Not even close. You seem to underestimate the amount of computing power directed at bitcoin mining.

Keys for your keys, love it.
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:00:15
The green side is buys, the red one is sells. When you see a wall it means someone put a massive buy/sell order at that price, so for the market to get through that wall, that order must be filled first.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:36:01
Just forward port 8333, install bitcoin core, run it, and let it do its thing. It will download the blockchain (~160gb) and run as a full node.

Yep, happens all the time.

What's different about this stress test than what bitcoin is experiencing every day recently?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:00:27
There was basically nobody selling after 10k, because they know if it is gonna go past 10k then it's gonna go much futher. So why sell right after 10k?
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:28:06
This transaction is 20 minutes old. Not 3 days.
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:19:17
Bitcoin itself is anonymous. The exchanges are not. If you want to be completely anonymous, you can buy bitcoin in person with cash with localbitcoins, or you can use an atm.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:38:05
What happens if coinbase goes under? You're fucked.
@_date: 2017-11-21 20:54:47
Yes, segwit addresses are fully backwards compatible.
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:14:23
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:28:56
It can take up to 10 business days for it to appear in coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:47:18
You didn't mention you're using coinbase. Yes, you should be fine.
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:08:06
The network is congested, everyone is having issues. Worst case scenario, your transaction drops out of the mempool and you get your coins back.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:06:46
Segwit is 100% compatible with legacy addresses, there is no risk in selecting a segwit address.
@_date: 2017-11-16 01:15:42
Transfer to GDAX first, then withdraw. They pay the fees for you.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:58:50
They're all protocols? That means nothing though. It's like comparing the protocol for the united states military launching a nuclear bomb and the protocol for making a pb&amp;j sandwich
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:41:28
The mempool seems to be growing a bit, so it may take a bit longer to confirm.
@_date: 2017-11-12 23:47:01
The transaction was confirmed just one block ago. Wait a few minutes to see if bitstamp updates, if not, contact bitstamp. All is good from the coinbase/network side.
@_date: 2017-11-21 18:52:14
Perhaps making it a little more fluid? Right now it seems a little like you just mashed together a bunch of frames - something I could easily do by having multiple browser windows open.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:52:01
I don't really understand the implementation of it, just the concept. I'm sure there are much more knowledgable people out there that have actually dove into the code.
@_date: 2017-11-10 07:50:31
Segwit has lower fees.
That's about the only difference.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:57:06


logic checks out

@_date: 2017-11-14 19:31:11
Anytime dude :)
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:07:47
The x axis is the price, so someone has a large sell order at $8,230.
The y axis is the amount of bitcoin, so that large order is ~300 btc.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:39:57
That is not what they said. They said the chain with the most accumulated difficulty would be called BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:52:12
Don't buy bitcoin with money you don't have
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:46:30
The price takes a shit and recovers after a while
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:22:57
I doubt reddit has enough money to impact the price much
@_date: 2017-11-07 00:51:24
Just a random number I pulled out of my ass. You get the point.
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:25:21
Look up atomic swaps. It allows you to trade coins without an exchange.
@_date: 2017-11-12 00:20:33
No, deposits and withdraws run into the same problem as everyone else and they must pay  a high tansaction fee if they want to make transactions in any reasonable amount of time
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:18:02
I wonder why...
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:31:51
I think we wait until lightning network to see if we actually need it after that
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:01:38
Then we get an ass load of blocks very quickly until the difficulty adjusts. Issue is, now a 51% attack is much more in reach than before.
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:02:10
A node receives and distributes blocks, miners create the blocks 
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:55:42
Holy shit that cliff
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:11:47
Honestly I thought this was a joke when I first saw it, and it still might be. But it has a [market cap]( so idk.
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:31:31
The machine doesn't need to be that powerful. I have an old dell with a pentium 4 in it running a full node.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:41:50
Open bitcoin core. That wallet.dat could contain bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:34:58
There is nothing wrong with that, just be very careful as it can be very easy to lose bitcoin while trading.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:28:14
Well, was it worth it?
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:56:29
How would you ban/regulate bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:23:15
That's why atomic swaps are such a big step forward.
@_date: 2017-11-14 00:39:25
Depends on what wallet you're using. Usually I just find the transaction in your transaction list and press 'forget this transaction' then I send the same transaction again, only with a higher fee. Not sure if this is the official way to do this but it works for me.
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:15:55
Segwit transactions are smaller. Smaller tx = lower fee
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:02:23
Honestly just leave it for fp.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:33:28
What's the question?
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:30:34
They can, doesn't mean it'll work. I'm not counting on it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:06:45
Because segwit2x was canceled
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:33:53
Crypto might mean cryptography. Not cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:52:48
I hear people like Breadwallet for iOS.
Coinbase _is_ a wallet that you _don't_ own the private keys for. When you buy bitcoin off coinbase, coinbase is basically saying "We'll do whatever you tell us to do with this bitcoin but we are still in control of it"
@_date: 2017-11-06 01:31:29
I believe the estimate was around 12-18 months
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:06:00
Sure you can kill the market cap of bitcoin. I'm saying you can't kill bitcoin as an entity.
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:37:22
If you have 1 bitcoin, after the fork you will have 1 bitcoin and 1 segwit2x coin

Look for a file named wallet.dat, without it you have no coins.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:28:51
There should be a "how to increase limits" button somewhere
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:40:06
Just keep a backup (or a few) of your wallet.dat file. There is no need to manually manage your keys.

@_date: 2017-11-17 21:32:28
I agree, but it is infeasible to create a truely decentralized worldwide blockchain while including every transaction ever made on it. If you can find a way to make this happen, I and a lot of other people would love to hear it.

Hardly sounds like a reason to send you anything
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:55

This will likely eventually drop out of the mempool and not ever get confirmed, you can increase fees/cancel transaction by right clicking on the transaction in the bitcoin core wallet
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:02:41
Then people would make powerplants in their basement and destroy the environment even more than they are now.

Bitcoin is still in its infancy and is still working out all it's kinks
@_date: 2017-11-12 03:42:32
You can manually encrypt your seed. Take the plain text seed and manually go through the math to convert it into base64 or something.
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:28:38
Then your transaction was confirmed.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:53:55
No, but does it have to be? Google retains every right to close your account as they see fit.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:56:46
It is completely safe to give you address as they are all public knowledge anyway, the only thing you thing you should never give out is your private key (hence the 'private')
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:41:36
You mean the whitepaper?
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:14:20
Check out coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:24:49
Hold on there, we're not quite there yet.
@_date: 2017-11-03 21:46:19
That fee is completely insane and you should never need to pay anywhere near that to get it included in the next block
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:40:57
Sorry man idk what to tell you. I would contact coinbase support if that's the case then.
Coinbase support is notoriously shitty though.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:15:03
Do you mean BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:04:55
Reducing the block time would result in more orphan blocks and forks.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:26:57
Unfortunetly no this is not possible. You would need to transfer through the blockchain.
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:06:38
Nobody is going to give you interest on bitcoin. Just hold it and watch the value of it go up.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:10:09
Yeah, bitcoin is likely going to get a fuck ton of press after it breaks 10k. Making the price go up even more.
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:23:32
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:54:30
You only get the benefits of segwit if the segwit address is the one sending, and coinbase does not use segwit addresses yet so the fee will be the same.

Those bitcoin are lost forever, decreasing the number of coins in circulation, increasing the value of each coin still in circulation.

@_date: 2017-11-06 19:53:38
Yes, if you make any btc or s2x transaction there is an uncomfortably high chance you'll lose the other coin. The s2x devs intentionally did not include any protections for this as they intend to replace bitcoin.

When you set up the wallet you are given a 24 word seed. You can use this to recover your bitcoin in the case of the wallet breaking or you losing it.

Coinbase has a 1.49% fee for transfering, rounded up to the nearest dollar. Then they add the network transaction fee.
If you deposit to gdax first and withdraw from there, they pay the transaction fee for you.
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:20:19
Yes it is possible. But why would you want to? sounds like a real clusterfuck if you ask me.

Depends on if your coins we're stored in an online wallet or a local wallet. If it was an online wallet (like coinbase), just download the app again and log in. If it was a local wallet (like mycelium), download the app again and use your seed words. If you don't have your seed then your bitcoin are lost.
@_date: 2017-11-03 22:04:40

I believe they're gonna lock everything up 24 hours before and after the fork. After that time, nobody really knows what you'll be getting.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:35:13
They just buy bitcoin using a portion of the money you pay them and send you it, then they keep the profits.
They have no reason to actually mine anything.
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:43:37
Bitcoins will always be mined. The block reward is halved every 210,000 blocks. Meaning it will go from 12.5 to 6.25 to 3.125 to 1.5625 and the block reward will never reach 0.
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:27:10
They probably used bitcoin-qt. Look for a file called wallet.dat
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:46:45
The nano ledger s software tells you about how much your bitcoin converts to, and I don't have experience with the trezor but I'd imagine it does the same thing.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:32:34
They support segwit2x apparently
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:18:18
Just put in a little bit periodicly. Like set up a recurring payment every week or so, so you don't go all in at once.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:07:44
Because not everyone follows bitcoin very closely. If the name changes to b1x or something, and segwit2x takes the BTC ticker, then many people will say "I'm gonna buy bitcoin!" and they end up buying segwit2x thinking it was the original chain.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:18:56
Yes, regardless of the wallet you send it to the fee will be the same

You may try asking this in As much as they hate bitcoin, you may get some very insightful answers.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:33:43
Bitcoin is almost impossible to steal, and it would be much more expensive to attempt to find private keys than it would to just mine it. Your credit card info got stolen, not your bitcoin.
EDIT: you might be able to chargeback, and then wherever they bought the bitcoin from would get mad at them and you would have your money.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:02:23
You could just plug it in once and write it down somewhere
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:14:48
Yes you get charged the network fee. People seem to like electrum, bitcoin core also works.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:16:49
As for issue 1, I've seen some people say give only half of your private key to someone you trust and the other half to someone else you trust, when you die they can put the 2 halves together to get your bitcoin.
You need to makw sure these are people you 100% trust though.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:50:01
This whole situation with the fork is really confusing and I feel like it needs to be specified WHICH bitcoin. I see too many people (specifically over at rBTC) refer to Bcash or S2x when they say "Bitcoin". 
If you want people to know what you're talking about, you have to be clear in your message.

It depends on how fast your internet is and how many connections you have to the bitcoin network. At full speed I get about 9% an hour

@_date: 2017-10-24 04:33:52
Please give the transaction id 
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:51:47
For anonymity I assume. Everyone can see how many coins your address has, so if one of your clients sees you have a bunch of money in the address you gave them, they might try to steal your private key.
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:42:34
Trezor is a physical device you buy. The ledger nano S is also another option for about the same price.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:53:14
Well you have bitcoin on one side of the fork, and bitcoin gold on the other. Splitting is the act of seperating them so you can spend both of them independently. I am not sure how this is done though.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:09:55
You can just store it in electrum or something until you get your hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:07:22
r/btc is not going to like this...
@_date: 2017-10-22 21:27:17
Honestly nobody really knows what's going on with bitcoin gold. Development is done behind closed doors and the devs aren't communicating much. I hear the fork was actually done sometime in the past and is only activated in a few days, I also hear the fork has not already happened and is a few days from now. Either way, you probably won't get your bitcoin gold if you keep them in coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:40:45
How are you sure of this?
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:05:14
still faster than fiat.

I keep it on my keychain. Mainly because I know Ill lose it otherwise.
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:04:05
Yeah you're right, I misread. That is a much bigger problem.
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:01:47
Difficulty does not increase due to the amount of transactions. Difficulty increases as the amount of hashing power increases.
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:43:02
I think we'll go all the way down to 5k, but I'm just some random guy on the internet don't listen to me.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:59:04
Well if it disappears then you can spend it again.
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:01:10
Immediately move it out of coinbase - No matter the amount. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:09:09
I believe you can initiate a transaction in coinbase and it will tell you the fee. I don't think coinbase lets you customize your fee, so you'll just have to go with what it says.
I have heard you can avoid coinbase fees by going through GDAX? But I've never done it so I don't really know.
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:40:04
Where would the problem be?
@_date: 2017-10-30 19:26:01
Between the 2 you really can't go wrong. I got the ledger nano s because it's conscience and looks like a usb drive.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:37:13
I mean, I guess a few people can profit? It's an incredibly risky move that I would definitely not take.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:27:41
By default bitcoin core will only allow incoming connections. It will download the blockchain and continue to stay up to date by accepting blocks from other nodes but will not send them. If you forward port 8333, it will become a full node and will begin sending blocks to other nodes.

You can transfer bitcoin out of GDAX without the fee
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:21:52
The credit card option is not new as far as I'm aware.
People are mad at coinbase because they're supporting segwit2x, and that they generally run on bankers principles, which is what bitcoin is trying to avoid.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:22:39

@_date: 2017-10-22 22:02:04
You have to wait until your funds are no longer pending
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:23:06
you paid a fee to buy and a fee to transfer, that is why you don't buy small amounts through coinbase.
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:14:25
From what I heard, coinbase wasn't 100% clear in their announcement about the fork. I believe they said they would recognize both coins but they said nothing about what next.
As for the price, once again nobody knows.
Just move/keep your coins in a wallet you control the keys for, that way you're guaranteed coins on both sides of the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:41:53
I'm glad you're asking questions. So many people over at r/btc don't.
Segwit was a soft fork, meaning it was not an exact *change* to the bitcoin protocol (IE bitcoin cashes 1mb -&gt; 8mb), but rather an *extension* of it. Meaning it is compatible with the current bitcoin protocol. Thus no fork.
As for segwit being a 'corporate takeover', I'm not really sure where that argument comes from actually, and I would love to see something point in that direction.
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:14:53

Cryptos in general have infinite supply.

Definitely make a paper wallet. Never use coinbase to store your coins, only buy/sell there. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:59:08
I would think it sends those coins to the coinbase account associated with that email?
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:56:09
The bitcoin core wallet. All other wallets are developed in accordance with bitcoin core.
As for payment - I really don't know, but seeing as bitcoin is open source, I would assume they are not paid.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:59:55
I feel like Im gonna light my private key on fire using this.
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:38:19
Yes definitely move it out of coinbase (or any exchange for that matter). A paper wallet is the most secure option, hardware wallets are still very secure (personally I use a nano ledger s), and software wallets are secure in principle but keep in mind your computer can get hacked and your keys stolen. 
@_date: 2017-10-30 20:27:40
If the fee is too low it will eventually drop out of the mempool and you can spend the coins again.
@_date: 2017-10-19 02:40:58
can't you just take (current block number) - (past block number)
@_date: 2017-10-16 03:06:27

@_date: 2017-10-20 18:04:11
It doesn't have to be an altcoin. I usually trade in low profile coins though, ones that don't have literally everyone keeping an eye on the market. And sometimes you can find market mismatches on different exchanges, where an altcoin is 4$ on exchange 1 and 5$ on exchange 2. So you buy at exchange 1 and withdrawal to exchange 2 and sell. Sometimes withdrawal fees get in the way of that though, so you can sometimes exchange your altcoin for another altcoin with a lower transaction fee, withdrawal that, and exchange that for your altcoin on exchange 2, then sell.

Miners are rewarded the block reward plus transaction fees for transactions included in that block, and miners are only rewarded if they solve the block.

You're gonna be fine leaving it in there for only a temporary amount of time until you get your hardware wallet. Just don't use coinbase as a means of permanent storage.

@_date: 2017-10-22 05:08:16
They don't give you your private keys, so they're technically not your bitcoin. If anything ever happened to coinbase, or they decide to close your account, run away with your money, whatever - There is nothing you would be able to do about it.
As for the urgency, It really isn't. I just personally don't like to have my coins in any exchanges for too long. Coinbase is perfectly fine to buy coins from just don't use it for long-term storage.
@_date: 2017-10-23 01:24:41
the destop client is useless without the ledger
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:08:12
If you buy on coinbase I would suggest buying larger amounts, the fees will eat it up. A $5 buy has a $1 fee, which is crazy.
@_date: 2017-10-30 22:22:59
If you have 3 chuncks(out of order) of 4 words(in order), there is only 6 ways you can reorganize them. So just try them until you get it.
This would be a much bigger problem if you did not group them like you did, there would be 479001600 ways you can reorganize them.
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:43:35
If bitcoin reaches 100% adoption the dollar will be worthless and therefore there is no need to measure the value of a bitcoin in fiat, meaning you can buy the same amount of bread today as you can tomorrow with 1 bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-22 04:44:14
Well traditionally DoS attacks are carried out on a single server or a small group of servers. Because every node on the network is essentially a server, you would need to attack thousands of nodes to have any noticeable impact. You would need an absurd amount of computers for an attack like that.
I'm not saying an attack like this is impossible. It is however, very much less susceptible than any centralized system.
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:55:20
Well I'm nowhere near qualified enough to make bitcoin price predictions (I just like the tech), but you have to get a gimps of the the big picture. Bitcoin is an almost brand new concept that most of the world really doesn't know what to think about. Tomorrow the US government could decide they want to kill bitcoin and take an aggressive stance against it, and what follows might be considered "bitcoin taking a huge shit".
Point is - bitcoin is not a well established form of currency.
When it comes to comparing to stocks: Stocks are not a currency. You cannot go to lunch and pay for your burger with stocks. Stocks are not a store of value (at least not directly), they are a share in a company. Bitcoin is a currency, and is intended to be spent freely.
However, if you compare the prices of stocks vs bitcoin. I guess you could see the prices align over different time scales. Where bitcoin is like a super-fast form of stock trading.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:25:09
I don't actually belive there is a max fee, but any fee over 100 satoshi/byte is probably gonna get confirmed as fast as possible.

@_date: 2017-10-15 03:57:58
Probably. The thing is you don't know your private keys with coinbase, so you technically don't actually own your bitcoin. So if coinbase just runs away with all of your bitcoin there isn't really anything you can do about it. You just have to trust coinbase won't steal your money.

This is completely wrong, ssds do not 'lose charge'. They do however have a limited number of read/writes so an ssd will go bad if used excessively.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:47:56
Thank you for making another shitpost
@_date: 2017-10-14 05:00:51
I vote we stop measuring the value of bitcoin in dollars and start measuring it in ps4s 
@_date: 2017-10-15 03:42:52
I've never used a trezor but I see people speak highly of it. I own a nano ledger s which works great.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:44:31
We are such a minority in the world. 99% of people don't invest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-18 16:21:31
Id imagine hardware wallets use some very resilient storage but i am unsure of the details. Id also like to know how it works.
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:21:49
According to coinbase the fork has already happened but according to the bitcoin gold website it happens in 8 hours. I really don't know.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:07:07
The receiving address does change but the old address is still valid. And its not a good idea to use the same address for everything but that's what you've gotta do if you don't want to actually use the ledger to see your addresses.
I guess you could also put your 24 word seed into another wallet and use that, but that kinda defeats the purpose of using a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:57:28
did you just call yourself an asshole
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:25:34
You mean literally always in this sub
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:04:02
Just saying - If this ever does turn into something less-than-legal, they'll probably find this thread so I would delete it if it comes to that.
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:25:26
8 is the max if you're not running a full node
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:31:58
All nodes verify all blocks. If there is an invalid transaction in one of the blocks (the transaction is not properly signed, IE: a fraud transaction), the block is rejected.
@_date: 2017-10-23 02:25:31
They will be rewarded with the transaction fees
@_date: 2017-10-21 20:41:14
Depends on where you store the bitcoin. If it's in an exchange it would probably be up to the exchange. If it was in a private wallet only you hold the private keys for, then the bitcoin are lost forever.
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:11:54
I would assume that's what you were refering to when you said "Gold something". Otherwise I don't know what you're talking about.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:32:31
Why can't it replace usd? Bitcoin is divisible out to 8 decimal places.
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:05:39
Nobody really knows what the price will do this next few weeks
@_date: 2017-10-25 01:26:10
just make an account at coinbase and add a credit card
@_date: 2017-10-18 14:24:34
Well shit.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:56:26
Yes a hardware wallet should be just fine
@_date: 2017-10-19 17:47:18
It's essentially the same thing, only segwit has lower fee and faster transactions.
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:39:44
It should work right away (minus the transaction time which should be only a few minutes).
I've never made a paper wallet, all I know is a paper wallet is just a piece of paper with your private and public keys on it.
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:22:10
You'll want to keep your coins in a wallet you control the keys for hard forks. That way you're guarenteed coins on both sides of the fork, and you're not at the mercy of whatever exchange you have coins in.
As for keeping track of addresses: Software/hardware wallets should handle that for you. I know some wallets offer complete control over your addresses, but I've never done it so I can't say anything about it.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:31:27
This is correct
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:17:18
A double spend attack is executed by the sender, and if someone manages to actually do it on you (they won't), you'll get double the amount of coins.
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:33:27
Miners are paid transaction fees as well as the block reward
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:14:20
Honestly it sounds like you're doing great. Just make sure you're not putting in money you're not comfortable losing.
@_date: 2017-10-30 17:02:24
This is a great reply
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:36:21
Most software wallets allow you to use a custom fee. Just keep in mind, lower fee = slower transaction
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:51:39
Way too many people have this exact same mentality. If we don't address them appropriately, bitcoin will struggle more than it needs too.
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:14:08
Everyone is trying to get out of coinbase and gdax for the fork. Its congested.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:59:19
Theres a little lcon in the bottom right you can mouse over and it will tell you
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:19:41
I completely agree. Bitcoin is still in its infancy and has a long way to go. If bitcoin ever becomes a mainstream means of payment its value will stablize.
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:39:54
Yes that would be better. I buy about $100 a month.
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:41:07
I'm not. 
I don't support bitcoin cash or segwit2x.
The main problem with bitcoin at the moment is obviously scalability, some people think that the solution is to increase the block size so more transactions can fit inside each block. This is a very temporary fix, and I'm sure you know that. Eventually the blockchain will get so big that people don't want to run full nodes, leaving only the big boys running nodes, thus, centralizing bitcoin. But off-chain transactions allow for you to make much more transactions without blowing up the size of the blockchain and is extremely scalable. However, until this is ready we have to make due with what we have.
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:03:19
If you're just holding a paper wallet is perfect
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:30:51
The hope is that bitcoin will eventually stablize so people can comfortably buy things with bitcoin. For now, when you buy things with bitcoin, immediately buy more bitcoin to refill what you just spent.
@_date: 2017-10-20 16:48:18
Literally nobody knows
@_date: 2017-10-27 20:43:57
It has been happening increasingly lately. Increased segwit adoption and the upcoming lightning network should sort all this out.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:07:26
Yes, print out as many as you need.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:27:50
We're all skeptics, bitcoin is still in its infancy.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:28:19
Someone should fork bitcoin and just straight up call it shitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:03:46
Well the only real difference i see between your 2 scenarios is that one is money and the other is not. Bitcoin is meant to be money. Is bitcoin officially recognized as a form of currency by law? I really don't know but if it is I'd imagine it's taxable.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:42:51
I think you have the wrong sub.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:45:24
Nobody knows
@_date: 2017-10-18 18:52:56
You have the 24 word seed. So if it gets lost or destroyed you can recover your wallet. And the ledger itself it useless without the 8 digit pin.
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:33:18
I hope this is a joke...
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:49:26
You read it on the internet therefore it must be true.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:19:32
Idk what a super node is but a full node is what you described as a super node
@_date: 2017-10-29 04:04:40
Just copy-paste your addresses
@_date: 2017-10-26 00:10:55
If bitcoin reaches 100% adoption and all coins are mined, then bitcoin price should become stagnant.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:23:23
The goal of bitcoin is to be a currency, and it is - to an extent. You can't go out to lunch and pay for your burger with google stocks.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:25:55
Literally nobody here cares about your shitpost-tolerance. Just know that you're not helping by making another one.
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:52:17
The transaction fee is very low, that would be why
@_date: 2017-10-22 20:47:13
Devs program - they make updates, add features, make sure bitcoin is secure. Currently the main problem they're trying to solve is scaling.
Miners confirm transactions and create blocks with large amounts of computing power.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:34:07
You can't just say something like that and provide no source...
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:29:08
I think it would be the exchanges fault, for misleading buyers, and I think there's gonna be some very angry people that buy b2x thinking its btc.
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:43:48
Very constructive post you got there
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:36:53
I thought that was a joke.
@_date: 2017-10-20 19:25:20
It only hit 6k on some exchanges, not all.
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:50:54
Only spend money you're willing to lose. You seem to be in a very financially stable position, so I would go for it.
@_date: 2017-10-27 07:29:36
There's probably a more technical term but I'd call it just a node.
@_date: 2017-10-27 17:48:31
The mempool is a little congested at the moment. Your transaction fee looks fine, how long has it been unconfirmed?
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:35:13
Your post was not deleted
@_date: 2017-10-25 15:31:00
You will make practically nothing
@_date: 2017-10-22 22:04:58
You what now?
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:24:45
wow that was fast
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:41:04
Any coins acquired before the fork will result in coins on both sides of the fork
@_date: 2017-10-15 04:03:42
I've never owned a trezor, but I do have a nano ledger s. I would assume the process is similar - when setting up the device it will generate an address you can send your coins to.
@_date: 2017-10-22 06:00:41
No need to be sorry for asking questions!
As I understand it: your 24 word seed is a way of generating a massive amount of unique keys and addresses. Your seed is basically the keys to every address in your wallet. So my nano ledger S has a 24 word seed I wrote down on the little card it came with. That is my paper wallet, and it contains all of the information my nano ledger s currently has.
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:59:06
@_date: 2017-10-23 05:29:27
Why? We already struggle with full blocks. We need effective off-chain transactions or something before we can even consider reducing the block size.
@_date: 2017-10-31 01:11:35
n             o             .
@_date: 2017-10-23 23:31:10
Yes however you may need to split it. I'm not exactly sure how you do that though.
@_date: 2017-10-25 16:28:40
at least $7
@_date: 2017-10-30 21:40:46
@_date: 2017-10-11 16:54:22
I really don't know who this is directed towards...
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:31:56
tbh I like it, little overpriced imo
@_date: 2017-10-24 00:27:40
Many people consider 2 as being valid
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:49:58
They want to take bitcoin away from the core devs. 
Because they're evil... or something.
@_date: 2017-10-13 06:45:13
I just bought one off amazon a few days ago, everything seems fine. I set it up just fine and didn't notice any red flags.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:11:26
Both the trezor and nano ledger s have a 24 word seed that can be used to recover your coins and addresses in the case of losing or breaking your wallet
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:28:21
Nice try
@_date: 2017-10-28 21:26:54
I find a scenario like that very unlikely, but if it does happen the longest chain would win, and all other chains are invalid.
@_date: 2017-10-30 16:59:23
Leading up to the fork it's almost certain the price will go up. After the fork nobody really knows, people may dump bitcoin for segwit2x or the other way around.
@_date: 2017-10-15 02:06:20
Nobody really knows what coinbase is going to do for sure. It's best to be safe and just move it into a wallet you control the private keys for.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:46:58
The idea is you sell on spikes and buy in dips, that way you end up with more bitcoin than when you started. You can certainly try day trading, but it can be very risky. One wrong move and you just lost a possibly large amount. If you want to try it, I would recommend getting your feet wet first and throw 10 or 20 dollars at an altcoin and see what you can do from there.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:23:10
I would assume so, why wouldn't it be?
@_date: 2017-10-22 05:09:33
Well that has been the trend for quite some time now
@_date: 2017-10-19 01:42:50
I use the little string it came with
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:11:23
I would not recommend this as there is no replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-20 18:20:22
Bitcoin mining with a home pc is not at all profitable anymore and you won't even come close to covering electricity costs.
@_date: 2017-10-29 05:51:06
The only reason it is rarely used is because it is such a new store of value. Compared to fiat which is hundreds of years old, bitcoin is only 8 years old. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 04:55:53
Just keep in mind the worst case scenario - you throw all your money down a hole.
I'm not saying bitcoin is going to crash tomorrow - it's incredibly unlikely. But it is possible.
EDIT: I should probably add: Definitely invest in bitcoin, it's just how much is the question.
@_date: 2017-10-25 02:28:51
you were probably hacked
@_date: 2017-10-23 06:03:42
The dollar has lost 90% of its value in the last 100 years.

Someone has to buy the forked coins for anyone to profit.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:54:06
Well bitcoin cash hard forked bitcoin, they changed the protocol. Shouldn't the chain that did not change be refereed to as bitcoin?
And with segwit2x you can apply the same logic.
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:30:36
I actually do support small blocks, it just needs to be implemented in a way that doesn't cripple bitcoin. You can't reduce the current block size without further bottlenecking transactions. We need LN or something first.
@_date: 2017-10-17 21:38:33
Paper wallet would be the best. It's just a peice of paper with your keys on it, which are valid on both chains.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:31:45
If they start buying, the price is gonna skyrocket and they're gonna run out of money.
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:05:39
I believe it is to reduce orphan blocks
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:00:58
transaction fees go to the miner, they don't go away
@_date: 2017-10-25 14:54:16
Until you get a hardware wallet: yes
Indefinitely: no
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:41:18
Your full node is secure in principle - but what if you get hacked? Then your bitcoin could get stolen.
Your hardware wallet leaks no data to the computer it is plugged into, therefore it is more secure.
I would keep your bitcoin on your hardware wallet and continue running your full node
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:18:27
Storing your coins on a hardware wallet is perfectly safe for a fork
