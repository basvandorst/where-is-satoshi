Where did you buy it? coinbase?  
Was it a manual dollar cost averaging method?
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:33:01
But if you didn't sell it at $500, and then it went to, say, $2400...would you have sold them then??
I'd say you probably would. The fact is, you wouldn't have hedl on this long to your BTC.

The way the questions were answered was not to my liking. I had to turn it off when she started saying what you could buy with bitcoin.
Explaining that it's a payment system at the same time, also means nothing for people who know nothing.

Apparently a cult leader kept the money that his followers gave him in cash donations.
Is this what ~~cults~~ cash brings to the table?

I heard that single this morning and thought I'd look to see if this was mentioned. Obviously you didn't get much kudos for this.
@_date: 2014-04-22 20:26:26
At least 13 down votes. Anyone care to explain?

Exactly, I signed up expecting a free ride (heh :-) but I just got a page saying well done, you're now signed up, download the app and don't forget to give that app permission to use every fucking thing on your phone and check all your accounts.

Surely you mean minimize and not close?
What phone do you have?
@_date: 2014-12-17 15:28:02
you can put it in once and save the device for 30 days to avoid putting it in. 2FA is never silly IMO.

Reminds me of Visa's failed Visa Cash experiment.

You say nodes are cheap. But you have at least $28,950 worth of crave locked into your nodes. Cheap is relative.

I think that's a good attitude. Do you know how to find out what POS coin returns the best at a given time?

What's your point? Is the OP stupid for living in a small country?

Don't forget to have a simple dial that goes from 1 - 11 which makes the alarm go off if the price changes by 1%-11% in a given time frame.

Ya, I was showing reading incomprehension.

I think you should take out your original 40,000 when they hit $700.

I took it form the image that he *bought* at that price. He's "all in long now" meaning he thought it'd continue to rise?

How are you getting up votes for this?
Where are the clear alternatives you are talking about?
OP is obviously an Irish customer and Ireland has no free alternatives (unless you keep thousands of euro in your account).

You'll see why he thinks it's deflating. Hint: because it is. Personally I think they'll level off around $350.

The lawyers told them that they NEED to know who they're dealing for so that they don't get closed down for laundering assistance. They're based in the UK as far as I can tell and they by law would have to keep your personal info very safe. They're also very strict with their verification so personally I think it's ok.

How about BTC-E.com? Is there some issue with them like fees os something? Sorry for the noob question.
