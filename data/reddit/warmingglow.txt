Because I can immediately start using a new computer. What a terrible analogy.

If someone has access to your Google account, can't they download authy and reset the authy password and install it on their phone and login to your authy account?

I'm not doubting Amazon will get into Bitcoin, I'm doubting your part (which you have since edited out) where you implied his reason for doing so would be to make some kind of name for himself, or that bitcoin would take over credit cards "soon."

Why can't he just multiply 10k x 100?

You mean "live analysis" that is completely drowned out by the EDM you have blaring over the stream? Cannot hear a word you are saying. 
@_date: 2018-05-06 02:03:26
They won't regret it "soon" because there is no way btc will replace credit cards "soon."

We are discussing it. Right here in the DAILY DISCUSSION thread.

People could have enter the market just as easily when it was at 19k how is now any different? You don't have to buy a whole coin.
@_date: 2018-06-15 07:55:43
The idea that you're laughing out loud at it dropping another $1200 when it has already dropped 13k makes me lol.

I sold at 11,500 and just set a stop buy order at 9800. Does anyone think this is a bad idea?

There is no parole in the federal system. His only chance is a presidential pardon (will never happen) or overturn by the Supreme Court. He will die in prison.

I don't know what ladder buying is. I really have no idea what I'm doing. I've only got 2k on the buy. I just wanted to see if I could make an easy $200 or so since I've seen the price fluctuate so much. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:47:07
I want to place an order on GDAX only if the price goes up to 9600. Would I do that through a Stop Buy order set to 9600? When I try it, I get a message that says "This order may fill at a price less favorable than the stop price. Are you sure you would like to continue?" What does that mean? 
@_date: 2018-03-09 02:28:25
Great advice! Right now I am mainly trying to save up enough to own 1 BTC. I'm close to .5 now, and I have been hoping for a crash for awhile so I can buy more until I reach my goal. Then I will just sit on it for ten years and see what happens. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:02:18
Thank you! I leave the "Limit Price" section under Advanced blank, right?
@_date: 2018-02-17 13:24:47
If you believed in it you would be spending it and using it as a currency.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:59:27
But it wouldn't be drastically higher, right? I don't want to end up buying at 10,500, but I am okay if it executes at 9700 or so.

I'm not watching an hourlong video in order to give it an upvote. Add a TL;DW and maybe I will. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 21:59:52
Because I don't want to watch an hourlong video to find out what someone could explain in five minutes, it means I don't support the crypto community?
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:04:08
Thanks. I guess my thinking is that I don't wan to buy now if it will drop further, but I REALLY don't want to miss buying if it starts to go up. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 21:27:17
I thought I was hot shit because I sold at 11,800 and bought at 9500. Wish I had set that stop order just a couple hundred higher. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 00:37:16
Ha! Yeah most likely with my luck! The only good investment I have yet to make is the $35 I put in 4 years ago. All downhill since then. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:04:31
GDAX - can anyone explain to me specifically what to do to set an order in GDAX so that if Bitcoin goes back up to 9500, I automatically place an order (preferably with limited fees)? I tried reading up on limit/stop orders to do this with a sell order and I screwed it up and ended up selling at my lower limit. Thanks for any help!
@_date: 2018-02-19 23:20:29


No, because you are viewing it as a store of value, and it has no value unless people also use it as currency. If everyone only holds onto it and doesn't use it, it will be replaced by another altcoin that people do use, and its "value" will plummet. Nowhere in Satoshi's whitepaper does he describe any use for it as a store of value. Fortunately, there are other people who actually believe in it as a currency, which balances out the stupid "just hodl" advice most of this subreddit pushes and keeps your value positive. You're welcome. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 21:20:02
Thanks! Volume would only be $1500 worth.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:48:24
OKay I guess you are correct in that you can say they "believe" in Bitcoin as a long term investment, they just don't believe in it as a form of currency, the way it was originally intended (in Satoshi's whitepaper).
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:42:58
So you just took the top post from and then added the word "bitcoin" to the title?

What are you basis your assertion on that "7200 and 6800 aren't likely?" It dropped 9$ in 24 hours. It went down to $8100 today. You don't think it can drop another $900 within 30 days when it just dropped $1000 in a day? Oh my innocent summer child...
@_date: 2019-09-25 01:01:55
Your portfolio is way too leveraged in bitcoin then if you are down that much.
