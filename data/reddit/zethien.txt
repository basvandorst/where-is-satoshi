its noticeable to you because you came late. For everyone already holding when the price was very low at the beginning, the price/gain is high. This is why bitcoin is unfairly stacked against you. The greatest rewards go to the earliest entrants.

That's not really at all the most fundamental problem. The problem is the economics of bitcoin. Where the hallmark deflation+cap drives speculation. As such, we also unfairly bias the rewards to the earliest adopters who managed to hold large sums. Holding essentially means taking coin and purposefully doing nothing with it, removing yourself from the productive economy. New entrants are left to speculate on the available supply and actual producer's overall efforts go to unfairly reward those who did none of that producing. This is still why to very astute people they liken it with a ponzi scheme, because rather than the value of the coin be rooted in actual production, its rooted in speculation and how many people you can convince to drive up the demand and price of the coin for you the previous entrant. Additionally, speculation is really one of the major components everyone really has a problem with in fiat, all we did was turbo charge it. So I know we like to think we made something new and great, but if all we really do is continue to repackage the same underlying problems that people arent able to recognize that they really had with the predecessor fiat systems, then what did we really change? In otherwords, we havent yet really changed the old way of thinking yet... thats the real cognitive dissonance...

Whats so crazy to me is many bitcoiners recognize the problems, they just dont want to complete the equations:
*    "missed the bus"
You recognize that the earlier you get in and do nothing with your coin the longest that you're getting the greatest reward. No production or real work on your part.
*    "if satoshi sells his coin it'll crash the market!"
You recognize that people holding and restricting the supply ups the price, because people are speculating on how much is available. I saw somewhere someone say, "Satoshi should send his coin to a burn address so we know that coin will never come to market and then price will go up!" In that case, what not just algorithmically get rid of unused coin? By supply-and-demand that'll up the price. (Plus it'll encourage an actual economy) Or hey, why even make new coin at all to begin with? All that new coin from mining is keeping the price down, why dont miners hold on to their coin instead of dumping it for fiat!
Point is, its set up rather poorly, and I dont think its totally the fault of the original idea, its largely in part of bitcoiners treating as something to buy, with the assumption that its always going to up up up. The wealthiest in the prior system are the only ones able to move into the new system; if I want to work for bitcoin, the longer and harder I work the less coin I receive over time, because my labor is the real constant, while the price per coin goes up. Meanwhile all you had to do, if you even had the ability to and was born early enough, was buy coin and sit around and do absolutely nothing, and your wealth goes up, just spend a fraction of your gains. Bitcoiners are really not looking past themselves, and the short term. And thats sad because many of us really do want to see something like bitcoin succeed. We've been given the opportunity to change the world for the better, not repackage the same bullshit I thought we all were trying to get away from. Buttcoiners dont have to want to destroy bitcoin, alot of bitcoiners are ultimately going to do it themselves, if they dont start looking at things critically.

if you are referring the "the white paper" you realize white papers are more like product proposals and are not peer reviewed scientific papers. Papers that skip peer review process are probably doing so to avoid rejection, rejections cuz its wrong, rejection cuz its not well referenced, whatever the case may be. And even then, good science still calls in the peer review for peer review. Thats the process of finding something *is right* (to the extent of our knowledge). There is no perfect math here for bitcoin. A little bit of peer review would have been nice and would have made some acceptable math, and would have put bitcoin in a better place than it is now. Currently, its definitely far from perfect.

Just a note on the use of the word "We", often times its just writing style. I use "we" all the time when writing journal papers, etc, even though its often just me... It sounds more professional if you absolutely have to use a pronoun, but the best case I personally think is to avoid any pronouns to begin with.
And then just a comment, personal opinion, so doesnt mean anything. I've always doubted that Satoshi Nakamoto was actually japanese. The Japanese are not particularly inventive or revolutionary... innovative yes. But hierarchy and structure and government and "the established way" are huge points that are never really opposed... so, yeah. Ideologically, he and his work dont sound to me like they would fit the japanese mindset, as per my own experiences of course.

Looking purely at the numbers, the **hold** mentality, together with intrinsically set up deflation/limited-supply, creates and drives speculation. Which is fine for an investment, but not so much for a currency nor a **fair** store of value. Taking coin, holding it long term, afraid to spend it because tomorrow it will always be worth more because others speculate as to whether that supply is actually available or not, and the price goes up, not because of economic product, but because of uncertainty. The expectation of it rising, is in reality the expectation that everyone will increase your wealth and purchasing power for you, while you purposefully do nothing. If *everyone* has this same mentality then the economy doesnt actually work. And even if only a few have this mentality then the effort and production of others trying to get in later is the actual production sector, and should be the actual economy; what did we change from the fiat world we supposedly wanted to leave?  In essence we are rewarding the most those who dont produce/participate. I too am optimisitc of the technological potential and theory of the crypto movement, but being more academically inclined I'd like to see more study on these sort of topics (for the majority in crypto right now, your guess is as good as mine). Even though I'm not an economist, its at least within my ability to question how economically qualified are computer scientist and libertarians (who make very bad economist to begin with)...

In my opinion the more important method of creation is what he mentions as Bank credit in his chapter 7: 
Banks really do create the money. And in the end the FED just agrees/backs up that the banks have indeed created the money. There would be no mechanism for the FED to raise money through bonds without banks. There would be no new money in the money supply available to you and me with banks. To put it even more in perspective, the FED actually doesnt have any idea as to how much money is actually in the systems, its a guesstimate largely based on what banks report. SO a bank has its own private ledger, that its then asked to report... not saying that this is the case but banks really do have every incentive to fudge the numbers, how would anyone know when the bank itself is the key to knowing whats in the system? (We saw this with the libor scandal a few years ago...)
@_date: 2014-07-06 06:14:15
You're speaking of a bank run, which is exactly what happened for the great depression. The majority of money at that time already was "virtual" in a sense, and it simply didn't exist in a tangible form (cash) when customers demanded the money in their account. Today, it's unlikely a bank run would really affect anything for amounts &lt;100,000$ per account. (Because of FED backing)
What would really hit the banks though, is for everyone to pay off their debts. Debt is a form of money creation for banks (money gets created at the bank, not the FED, via lending). The process of paying off your debt is in effect a money "destroyer". You make that money no longer available as either debt nor asset to the bank. Pay off your debt completely and THEN pull all your money out of your account with them. That's the way to make them hurt.

I really hope people give attention to these types of articles, rather then bandwagon them out of existence. Fact of the matter is, if we want anything around here to be successful, its far more productive for us to be critical of the flaws, not just in technology, but more importantly the flaws in the social and economic structure we are making. Without attention to details outside of the technological, the lifecycle of bitcoin or any other coin will likely be very very short. Once we identify those problems I'm confident that technology will be our solution, but we have to understand the system we're trying to build in the first place.

Not sure what you were driving at, but if you actually look at the definition of liquidity it has to do with how readily a thing can be bought and sold. HODLing in the crypto world impedes that and reduces the liquidity. (usually increased liquidity is the more favorable thing)
Savings by the Keynesian definition is "the amount left over when the cost of a person's consumer expenditure is subtracted from the amount of disposable income that he or she earns in a given period of time. "
There is a difference between saving and hoarding.  Savings via a savings account does not remove money from the system, and instead puts money to work while its not in use by the owner, as such the supply of the money has nothing to do with the purchasing power of the money. This is why savings accounts at banks usually have a minimum balance, along with a maximum # of times you can withdraw per month. Putting money back to work is what's called a money multiplier, and allows for increased production, which does have things to do with the purchasing power of the money. Hoarding does not contribute to a money multiplier and it removes money from being available for additional production, with the explicit intent of driving the price up by nothing more than speculation on supply.

in addition to what theNicestMonkey said, when you invest in a company, the company has a sort of obligation to you to give you a ROI. There's an obligation, a responsibility, and accountability. When you "invest" in bitcoin, you dont have any of that. Bitcoin isnt obligated to do shit for you.

Voluntary is a tricky word. From the point of view of a democratic government the people *voluntarily* give bailouts to the banks, or allow citizens labeled as terrorist to be indefinitely held without a court hearing, etc. The people are presented with a false choice: "this that I want you to do, or something bad", the people *voluntarily* choose only from what they've been presented, and almost always choose the "this that I want you to do" out of a desire to avoid harm (even though its actually harming them). Or it is seen that the people can *voluntarily* choose to not reelect those individuals in the next election cycle (which doesn't really happen...). I think the US is a great case in point that "voluntary" can be overwhelmingly corrupt. And frankly there was never any nostalgic golden time in the past where we did have freedom or whatever. We quite simply never have. 
How was there ever democracy without some medium like the internet? There wasn't. The closest we have to real capitalism is the tech/web industry, the internet allows for low barriers of entry, actual free markets, and all that jazz (though still plagued by monopolies). How was there ever communism with dictators at the top, and no free association? There wasn't. 
With the internet, we can finally test all these ideas in their real forms, and most (if not all) of these ideas technically pointed to decentralization in some way for their time(s). Hierachy only seems natural because historically that's the only method within our capacity we could ever implement. Our capacities and potentials have changed with the internet, so too can our outlook toward hierachies.

actually... ecuador aside, in the long term, consider that the deflationary and set number of coins in existence drive speculation, which is fine for an investment, but maybe not for a currency or **fair** store of value. Consider the hold mentality: I'm going to get in *early*, buy as much as I can and just hold on to it, never spend it, never touch it. You've become a non-participant, and a non-producer to the coin economy. Yet the effort and production of everyone in the smaller space where coin is moving increases the price, *and your* wealth. So in essence we are rewarding the most those who purposefully dont do anything. And maybe its even worse, because we are rewarding most those that did nothing the longest/first. So as new generations come in and want to be within the coin economy, first, how are they to know what coin is actually available? What coin is actually lost, or  just being held on to by people not wanting to actually do anything with it. You wouldnt know, and you'd have to speculate. Which again, seems perfectly fine for an investment. But maybe not for a currency.... and secondly, are we to expect that miners would be a fairer distribution or issuance of money to new participants? I dont know. 
Maybe what we really want is to peg 1 coin to the value of 1 acre of land, or something more imaginative or something like that. Maybe we actually do need to have a fluid number of coins in existence as the number of people in existence is itself fluid and changes. Maybe there needs to be a way to determine when coin is lost, versus just sitting around doing nothing. I dont really know. But something seems a bit short sighted about one of the main-pillars in the way we've set up alot of coins.... If the wealthiest of people are those who came first and arent really doing the most of anything, what did we change from the fiat world we supposedly wanted to get away from? What I'm trying to say is I'm not so sure about this **treats all participants equally** statement right now. Does it even need to be that way? I'd like to see it that way. But not sure it is that way now, or will be that way with the current set up... thoughts?  I guess it all depends on what you want your end goal to be: do you just want to make profit for you and screw everyone else in time that comes after you? Or do you want something that really does treat everyone fairly and equally, and honors effort and production, even for those that have yet to be born?
That aspect aside, technology wise, the bitcoin platform is far superior and will continue to get better. There's really no reason a government couldnt do it I guess... give each citizen a standard fair miner. Maybe that would fix the money issuance distribution problem, even across time (new generations of unborn people). That's kinda the growing pains we saw in bitcoin and litecoin as it went from the distribution of "most everyone" to "mega mining farms that the later average person will never be able to do".
I'm more academically and theoretically inclined and I wish there were more rigorous studies by real economists and political scientist and not just amateur investors pretending to be economists cuz they read some wiki pages (even worse, on libertarianism...). Your guess is as good as mine, but if we are to really get anything around here to survive, I think its a better idea to be critical and questioning. (sorry for the long ass slightly off topic reply, I feel like i'm doing my part by trying to start up this type of conversation more every chance I get).

@_date: 2014-09-17 02:36:15
well right now its probably great to borrow, since the price per coin is going down (that is if the terms of the loan isnt denominated in fiat....). That means if you wanted to borrow 1000$ worth you'd get more coin now, than you would if the price per coin was higher. But because most people are expecting the price to go back up, they probably wont lend.
Long term, if the mechanics of bitcoin worked the way they were set up to, you really wouldnt want to borrow, because the price per coin would increase, meaning you would owe significantly more even though you are just paying back the same amount of coin... To put it more clearly, if you were working for coin, since your labor is much more constant than anything else, you would have to work more and more hours as time goes on to pay off the increasingly valued coin.
The former point is the problem with speculation. The later point is the problem with a deflationary currency...

If you subscribe to MMT (Modern Money Theory) then this is an excellent website that explains the broad money supply generation: 
In short the bank relies on the fact that the vast majority of your money is in digital form (in this sense bitcoin isn't very "revolutionary"). When you pull a loan, the bank simply makes up those numbers in a computer. Once issued they rely on that loan is likely not cashed out, you simply deposit it in your account, which is likely held at the same bank! So its all just numbers in a computer to them. The notion that banks "raise money" via these deposits (or even that governments "raise money" through taxes) seems to be false. Its all just numbers in a computer. Once a loan is issued the bank then turns around and does a couple of things, first they might deal with reserves (which are mandated to them, but don't much matter towards our question... canada as an example has no reserve requirements) which they do through interbank transactions in the after hours market. If necessary that go to the fed who **will always** issue them reserves (like recently, at no-to-negative-interest). So in essence the bank created money in digital form, and the government says that it is money, we the people in turn say that our government is the authority on this subject. And that's it. The other thing the bank does is use your debt as a commodity, they package it up and sell it, bet against, buy it back, whatever, which brings in more revenue towards their net worth.
I think, what you'll realize is that despite political discourse, there's actually very little incentive for the banks or the government to really ever want the debt to be paid back. Because paying off the debt destroys that debt-created-money (there's an interactive tutorial in the link above).

As a note: I am uncomfortable with this and many many other things about our current financial system. I think questioning and thinking it doesn't all make sense is a good thing...
Now if you are asking about the subject of where does **value** come from, that's even harder, I dont think there is any widely accepted be-all-end-all theory on that yet. I'm no expert, but frankly I dont think anyone can even tackle this question (and the broader question as to "what is money") unless they bring in all resources of political and social theory, economics, psychology, etc.

(I like throwing jabs at everyone so to rustle more jimmies) Everyone likes the century-long questions of "why are we here", "who made us", and think something like the bible is an answer to that and everything else. IMO If the bible really was all we needed and the basis of everything, it'd answer another important question "why do we even use money? And where does its value come from?"

obviously 1$ is an extreme, but if the price right now is 200$ and I got my coin for practically free at 0.02$ a coin, then yeah, I dont really care, I still have a gain of 10,000% at that price. So yeah. The better reward goes to the earlier adopters.

I think if you are likening this to a lottery then you are already very skewed. You could say that the founding fathers and the first bankers and captains of industry in the new born US took an "enormous risk on a super volatile and unknown asset". Therefore the system should always forever be skewed to reward them or whomever they choose to succeed them enormously disproportionately. They created it all.  "Of course the reward should go to those who are in first/earliest, they're the networks strongest reason for success and its staunchest supporters." Isn't this what we already have? Isn't this what we already think is unfair about the US and other countries and their respective fiat currencies?
I wonder why (if you do actually believe the quotes above, dont want to put words in anyone's mouth) why you have a problem with the banking system and the traditional fiat systems we have right now to begin with. You just said, those people took the risk, they are the reason for the success of everyone else. They *deserve* it all. The individual who came later (who, as an example, was simply born later, a lottery of birth) on the other hand, from that perspective, hasn't done shit all in comparison. I dont believe that to be the case of how things should probably be, and I do think that all we're doing here right now with bitcoin is "fixing the problem" by "putting myself in place of the people I dont like". That's not really fixing any problem...
To exemplify my issue here, instead of a lottery, lets liken this to a different situation. Say you are down on your luck, you cant pay rent. There's and individual who can really annoy you, but he/she is the only friend or family you have. So you go to them ask them, "hey I just need 200$ for rent this month, I promise I'll pay you back". So lets think instead of strictly $, lets just say debt. The $ amount here is a debt you owe, bitcoin could be a debt, gold could be a debt, whatever. Debt. You take that borrowed money, turn your life around, it was a big part in making you the successful person you are today, a neuroscientist making millions a year. **If** the debt you owed to this person obeyed a *mathematically* predictable equation (AKA an agreed upon interest), then no problem you pay back 200$ + interest. But if there is no mathematical model, and only **speculation** as to how much that initial 200$ contributed to your now successful career, that annoying guy you had no choice in going to could every year, as you become more successful say you owe him more.  After all his investment was "an enormous risk on a super volatile and unknown asset". He was your first/earliest and strongest reason for success, and in many ways your staunchest supporter-- he took the risk on you. I imagine most people would say that's kinda bullshit. Yeah he gave you 200$, but you did all the work becoming a neuroscientist, he didn't do anything. 
This is the situation I speak of here in bitcoin now: we're going to reward those who took 5$ first/earliest and then expect everyone to owe them more and more as everyone else becomes more and more successful. (The way they keep you owing them is by never moving that debt, they just keep it and hold) If you dont personally see a problem with that, then I guess we can't have much of a debate. But I kinda feel somewhere deep down that if that's the way things turn out then we didnt really fix anything, we just replaced problems with pretty much identical problems in different packaging. Additionally, if we want to poke at the longevity of a fiat currency because of its inherent systemic problems, then since we're not all that different, we could say the lifespan of bitcoin will be just as (if not more) short lived: because the same motives to leave the system and seek a more fair and worthwhile system will just reemerge in a couple of generations....

Indeed it did, because its proven the need for proper currency management both money creation and money "destruction", as well as the absolute need for regulation. Everything that libertarians set out to prove got proved wrong.




Unfortunately the reason why bitcoin and other cryptos have like 2 active engineers on them is because the community has made it too toxic for all the other engineers to actually work on it. Engineers and scientist are **supposed to criticize, analyze, and improve**. The community actively prevents them from doing that, hence why all the engineers and scientist have left and arent here... (many of them I think are over in with their alts)

This is unimaginable because the bitcoin network can't even handle 1% of the worlds transactions to begin with. Lets say each human on earth made only 1 transaction a day (a hyper conservative estimate). 1 percent of 7 billion is 70 million or 7x10^7 transactions in a day.
Lets be liberal and say the bitcoin can process 100 transactions per second (which it cant, its more like 2.7 tx/s), that's 100x60x60x24 = 8.64x10^6 transactions, that's 1 order of magnitude short, assuming that all transactions go nicely onto the longest chain (no competing chains) and that they were processed immediately (0 confirmations). Even by giving bitcoin an exaggerated upper hand, it still wouldnt come close to servicing 1% of the world's most conservative users...
Long before a sybil attack is even considered I think transaction capacity would need to be the number 1 priority...

new industries, and innovation are not encouraged under deflation. When people are not buying new things, there are no markets available for industry to grow in ("you think people will by this new invention called Iphones?", "likely not, no one is spending money, the available market is only 1000 people who have enough money to spend everyone else wont spend it on iphones", "ok, then we wont make this iphone").
The whole point of capitalism is to put to use money that is not being used, when everyone is hoarding, money doesnt flow. An economy is by definition the flow of money.

I thought scarcity was what supposedly gave bitcoin its value. Wouldnt government then be good for bitcoin? Price to the moon?
@_date: 2015-02-14 06:08:48
tl;dr as simple as I can make it: deflation is different from depreciation.
you're confusing too many things thinking they are the same thing. First nice 2 second look at deflation: 
Second, remember your econ 101?  Cost of production goes down due to technological and strategic advancement, with costs down a company can do 2 things: 
1) keep its prices the same, and make a larger profit margin: profit = sell price - cost. Companies like Apple are very good at doing this on a number of their products, hence why every year the company profits go up.
2) it can lower the sell price, and make the product available to a wider market. With more people able to buy, the company is able to sell more. An example of this is Ford at the beginning of the automotive revolution, hence their profit goes up.
Its up to a company to decide the right balance between the 2 options.
However, both of these things relies on the ability of consumers to have available funds to buy. With controlled inflation, people are not encouraged to hoard, and are enabled to borrow if they need/want to. With deflation, people are encouraged to hoard, and are discouraged to borrow, even if they need to. You can grab a piece of paper and make a table/matrix, and work out the perato superior choices)[ With consumers, it doesn't matter what price your cellphone will be next year, people will forgo buying it if they feel discouraged from buying, sounds kinda obvious right? On a macro-scale, without people buying things, new industries will have a tough time trying to convince investors (who would already be discouraged from investing under deflation) to lend them money to take the chance on selling a new product that consumer dont know yet if they want. 
To address your example of cheaper smartphones every year: thats (depreciation)[ ie the utility lifecycle of a tool (smartphone) only goes for so long, knowledge of this encourages buyers to seek out a newer version at the end of the products lifespan, however they are further encouraged to make the deal if the item is cheaper this year than it was the last year they bought the product. So a company tries to meet this expectation by being technological progressive each year, if they dont, then competition will do it and consumers will go there instead. So two things at play: 1) the company is able to lower its cost of production by technological and strategic advancement and 2) the electronics industry tends to choose  from above and tries to make the product cheaper so that they can sell more to more people. Apple and their iphone/pads again a notable exception (the power of branding).
