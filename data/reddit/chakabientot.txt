Have you found someone there who will sell you some land for your BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:08:27
Hedge funds, mostly. Guys who have moved national currencies (like Soros with the £). 
Someone said it above, but this has a lot of hallmarks of a pump (with a dump to come).

I don’t know if it definitely is the case in the US, but most countries I’m aware of (certainly in Europe) allow you to offset capital losses and capital gains (and occasionally gains against income). I would be very surprised if you couldn’t use some losses against any gains you’ve realised.
Presumably though you would have to cash out before any gain crystallises - so no matter what the value / price now nothing until you sell.

Hedge funds are going to have a field day when the CME futures market launches.

Sorry to burst your bubble; put people have shorted (and won) in far bigger and harder to manipulate currencies than bitcoin before.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:07:46
That’s true; but currency is meant to be a medium of exchange rather than a store of value. A successful currency needs to be mildly inflationary so it isn’t simply hoarded.
Wealth creation and growth should be achieved through investing in assets, and that’s what bitcoin is right now: an asset. There’s nothing inherently wrong with that, but to suggest that it will be able to replace fiat is odd.
Perhaps a better crypto will come along and gain widespread usage; one that has the propensity to grow at a rate that supports low and stable inflation therefore allowing it to be used as a real fiat alternative, but that is a long way off.

Lol no i think I was either going to say “displaying the signs of (emotional investing)” or “you’re deceiving yourself”.
If you are investing because you see BTC as an incredible panacea you’re very likely deceiving yourself. You might be right but there’s an incredibly small chance: and the chance of you having that view because of emotional bias (on this sub) is exceptionally high. 
And I agree about investing what you can afford to lose; that’s exactly what I’m advocating for. Rational investors invest and take calculated gambles; emotional investors occasionally strike it lucky but, usually, the big boys eat them up. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:35:40
Ignore anyone who answers with HODL. They’ve swallowed the kool-aid. They might luck into being right, but meming an answer means they’re probably investing emotionally rather than rationally.

Next thread: how can I evade tax and help get bitcoin regulated into non existence in five easy steps? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:36:19
It’s almost like there are some hedge fund shills in here or something ��
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:19:07
Lol if the “regular money system fails” in anything other than the very long term in an orderly way you’re better off buying AK47 ammo than a bitcoin.

I did get a nice Christmas card today, actually. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:07:45


Not all that many. Unless they somehow get together to market time sales so as not to drive down the price of a highly volatile asset that’s value is inherently supply driven. 
You bet if all the people on here who claim to be BTC millionaires (most of them are probably bullshitters to be fair) sold simultaneously not many of them would be millionaires at the end of it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:45:31
I agree; but you’ve kind of supported what I’m saying by providing a reasoned and thought out response rather than a one word meme that looks like you’re just regurgitating what you’ve been told already. 
I’m not here to criticise people’s strategies; if I understood bitcoin as well as some I’d have bought it five years ago. I was here to make the point that noise investing isn’t a sound basis for decision making. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:27:04
It has a fundamental flaw that limits its viability as a currency: it in inherently deflationary.
Currency needs to be mildly inflationary (otherwise people just hold onto it as much as possible ie it becomes a store of value).  It has no necessary day to day use (ie being buying food or paying bills) so there’s not even that use. Which means everyone (like the memers in this sub) “hodls” it.
It resembles a store of value far more than a currency. And as an intangible store of value with little real world utility at this point it’s probably going to head towards store of value or death. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:50:47


No stupidity gets you killed. And assuming your BTC is going to matter if there’s systematic collapse within the next five years is stupid. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:28:26


You’re basically deceiving emotional investing. And it’s that attitude that leads to people getting burnt.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:00:48
That’s because this sub is full of HODLers who are either complete believers (zealots who cannot be reasoned with) or imminent sellers talking it up in the hope they can discourage panic selling and realise their own gains.
Because you know no matter how much everyone says they’ve made they still say I’ve made $/€/£ X because - ultimately - BTC is just an investment vehicle and not a true currency. It’s funny how everyone is talking up their USD wealth...
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:07:46
The implicit guarantee of a national economy? The strength of eg the Federal Reserve? 
Bitcoin might be intended to be a currency, but right now it’s acting like a real asset. It’s more like gold than the USD. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:57:15
Keep as much in your current account as you need for running costs until your next pay day and keep a necessities only emergency fund (ie your housing / food / heat for the next few months) and no more in cash.
That’s the golden rule. Anything else you have consume now (if you want to consume, that cash is worth more now* than it ever will be again) or invest. 
*unless you live in Japan. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:51:59
You don’t think they already have? They’re probably the reason for the recent spike. And right now every noise investor around is piling in just before the dump (when they’ll panic sell at a loss to protect themselves) to the big boys who will rinse and repeat. 
Again - some people will do well. But they’re going to be the lucky ones. Most of the HODLers in this sub haven’t got a clue. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:14:25
Presumably an institutional investor (or more likely a hedge fund trader) can enter into something akin to sec lending transactions with some of the whales whilst shorting?
Edit: tbc BTC is fungible. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:09:06
It definitely won’t. A crash of that kind in FIAT in five years will set us back centuries. You’ll be more likely hunting your food than buying it. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:57:04
It doesn’t behave like a currency, it behaves like a precious metal. Right now it’s value is driven by the belief that it is valuable. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:16:42


It seems you completely missed the point, and that’s fine. 


I don’t value it is a form of currency, no.


I’m not trying to convince anyone of anything; as I already said in my first comment most people are too blind (wilfully ignorant, if you like) to convince of anything on this subject.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:52:34
Or the mercenaries can just turn their guns on you. Of course you’d have absolutely nothing of value because, despite what a lot of people talking it to the moon will tell you, if FIAT fails completely nobody will give a crap about how much BTC you own. We will all be fucked. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:53:05
Having the backing of the largest economy the world has ever seen will do that. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:56:28
Yes: can confirm I don’t run a hedge fund. What’s your point? Are you one of the deluded ones who thinks fiat will disappear?
