In the case of both responses, I followed the rules, I'm not a troll, and Google only supplied me with info that would lead me in a shitcoin direction.  That's my whole issue here... asking for help, even though I understand the basics, is looked at like I'm a chump. 
I understand how things work, but I was hoping that someone much more educated on the subject could reccomend a place where I could get unbiased information to further my education.  I mined a whopping 0.2 of a coin on a pool like 5 years ago, but beyond that, I havent invested, don't have the money to invest, and only want to UNDERSTAND so that I'm aware.  
A few people gave me some info, which I appreciate.  I  just don't understand why it's needed to treat me like a fuckboy for asking a question which seems pretty pertinent to your Sub. Sorry for bothering everyone

No, if I ask the question directly again, I'll get the thread locked again.  I would very much like an opportunity to discuss

Yes, your answer helped, and ty

Im not worthy of asking help from a community of peers?  I can read biased articles all over the Web.  Hell this sub is biased,  but I fell behind the cutting edge of crypto knowledge, and wanted an ELI5 answer to a question you all appear very knowledgeable about.  So, bye, right?  Don't inform the ignorant about the "most public currency in history" right?

Its all good, I thought I was following the rules from the info,  but apparently Im not.  I think people here want to help, but others just see the newb as a troll or not worthy of education.  Thanks though!

The lock is lame though.  I want to understand from a Reddit community I trust, not the Web at Large...  real talk

It's awesome to hear of large transactions like this using bitcoin as a currency like it's meant to be used.  Nothing wrong with people using crypto as an investment vehicle either, but with the current state of things the currency part of crypto-currency takes a back seat in the media and for lots of people.  Pretty cool IMHO!
