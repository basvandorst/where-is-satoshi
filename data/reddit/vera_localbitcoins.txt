We aim at helping users to use our services smoothly and assist them in the best possible way when something goes wrong, but it is also our policy to prioritise the security of the funds of the vast majority of our users. 
We do not currently offer a recovery service for transactions containing cryptocurrencies that are not supported by our platform due to the risks it incurs - LocalBitcoins does not support Omni Protocol and we do not process USDT transactions. 
As you must know, it is responsibility of the receiver and the sender of a transaction to make sure that the wallet used is owned by the correct recipient and supports the coin that has to be moved.
Thank you for understanding!

Terve! 
Actually, we are still very much active in Finland (where we are headquartered).
As to the whereabouts of our founders, I am afraid they still have some harsh winters to face up here in the North :D

When there is a pending investigation or evidence that characterises an account as high risk, the account might be temporarily suspended until the issue has been resolved. Once the account is deemed safe for use, it should again be set to work regularly. 
You have done the correct thing by contacting support; our agents will give you instructions on how to proceed.

We are aware of this case and we apologize for the delay in completing your trade - we conduct the necessary investigation to make an evidence-based decision regarding each dispute. 
LocalBitcoins does not favor any part in a dispute, but analyses the information and facts provided from both ends of the trade in order to arrive to a fair and justified conclusion. When necessary, we also contact external services to cross-check data, which might cause the process to last longer.
Even though your feedback here is appreciated, only information posted in the trade chat/dispute form can be taken into account for dispute resolution. 
@_date: 2018-08-03 03:31:31
Accounts are being blocked in larger numbers as we have been adopting a more proactive approach in the prevention of fraud in our platform. The suspensions are removed once the reason for the original ban no longer exists and the account is considered safe for use in our services. Kindly note also that the processing of tickets for banned users can take a while, as we must thoroughly investigate the cases individually.

LocalBitcoins account's ownership cannot be transferred, i.e. you are not allowed to sell or give away your LocalBitcoins account. Aside from violating our Terms of Service, you will be deemed liable for any fraudulent/criminal activity conducted through the account.
**DO NOT SELL YOUR ACCOUNT.**

Firstly, I am sorry that you had a less than positive trading experience and I apologize for the communication problems with support - we have contacted you directly through your ticket with more detailed info on your case.
When a trade is started, Bitcoin are kept in LocalBitcoins’ custody (escrow) until the trade is completed. By our Terms of Service, if Bitcoins are held in escrow, LocalBitcoins has the legal means and processes to transfer the funds to either the buyer or the seller, and there is no need to create support tickets.
Cases that fall outside of that category - when the BTC is no longer in trade escrow - can be legally very complex as some processes involve 3rd parties and BTC ownership becomes unclear. Such cases cannot be simply resolved by us without the help from officials.
LocalBitcoins.com is always willing to collaborate with the law enforcement agencies, but an investigation can be interrupted for reasons that are beyond LocalBitcoins’ scope.
We sincerely hope that your issue will be soon resolved and we are available to provide all the assistance within our reach.

No - users have no access to our private key.
Unfortunately, it is not possible to recover transactions sent to LocalBitcoins addresses containing cryptocurrencies that are not supported by our service.

Hey! I talked to the person in charge of your case and we have contacted you through email.
@_date: 2019-03-04 06:51:20
I am sorry to hear your dispute is taking longer than you expected - we work with a limited staff on disputes over the weekend but note that in general, dispute agents will take as long as necessary to collect the evidences and information from both sides of the trade to support the dispute resolution. 
If you believe your dispute needs to be reviewed, please send me your trade number through DM.
@_date: 2019-11-20 07:35:42
I am sorry to hear that you are having troubles to verify!   
We are aware of the issues with the liveness test form; it might not load correctly in iOS devices or Safari, Internet Explorer or Edge browsers. 
At the moment, you should try to submit your T3 verification request using a different device/browser. 
If you have submitted the liveness test but you believe it has not been processed correctly, you should report the problem to our support agents through a ticket and they will get back to you with instructions according to your case. Unfortunately, support response time is longer than usual atm but we are working on improving it!
@_date: 2018-10-01 07:06:04
Support is able to give you that information if you send a ticket through the form  If you have not received the information yet, please send me the ticket number through DM and I will get back to you.
@_date: 2018-10-08 06:34:16
LocalBitcoins does not ban users for disputing trades; a support agent will be able to tell the reason behind an account's suspension. 
If you disagree with a deadline provided by the dispute agent or believe it is insufficient, you should explain it in the trade chat so the agent can evaluate the case before the dispute is resolved. 
@_date: 2018-10-29 08:44:52
We are sorry to hear that you had negative trading experiences in our platform! 
Note however that users can sometimes request extra ID verification to comply with their local regulations or for safety reasons. Traders are not allowed to refuse to complete trades without a fair reason; for instance, if a trade has been opened through an ad, the BTC corresponding to the purchase amount has been taken into escrow already therefore the seller cannot claim not to have funds to complete the trade. 
When you complete a trade, we strongly suggest that you make sure to upload proof of payment through the trade chat, so in the case of a problem in the trade, admin will already have access to your payment receipt when investigating the case.

Your LocalBitcoins wallet is as safe as your account - make sure that you enable 2FA, login guard and access the website from a bookmarked page to avoid phishing attempts.
We recommend that our users use their LBC wallets for trading purposes (keeping the funds to maintain ads active and what wish to sell) and move their BTC to a personal wallet (where you have control of the private key) for storage

Hi Bitmexxed,
I am sorry that your case is taking longer than you expected.
We have received your evidences and processed your request successfully - note that if a dispute has already been resolved and there are no coins in escrow, a process might require manual procedures that are handled according to a slower queue.
The issue under your trade has not been forgotten - our agents will contact you through your ticket or trade chat to update you.
@_date: 2019-12-03 08:41:26
Tier verification has been announced in June 2019 and gradually implemented until November 2019, giving users time to adapt to the new requirements accordingly. Note also that LocalBitcoins recommends that all users follow their local regulations.
Regarding your data protection concerns, please review our Privacy Policy carefully where our practices and your rights are described in detail  .
@_date: 2019-04-24 10:06:20
Accounts can be suspended when there is a violation of our Terms of Service and evidence of fraudulent activity - in most cases, the ban/wallet freeze can be lifted by following support's instructions or when the account is deemed safe for use. If you believe your case has been mishandled, please send me your ticket number through DM.
@_date: 2018-07-31 08:50:04
We understand your frustration and we are very sorry that your trading experience has been less than positive.
The duration of a dispute depends on the complexity of the case; claims and evidences from both sides must be investigated.

Regarding your case, we have contacted you with more specific details through DM. Your collaboration is much appreciated!
