We had kids and naturally became more risk adverse.
@_date: 2019-07-15 14:03:49
Yes, you are the only one. You are personally responsible for the inevitable price recovery.

Was gonna post just to say "Bart!" but I don't want to appear juvenile.

This post = 5 out of 7.

More stupid bitcoin memes.
@_date: 2019-06-11 04:58:04
Probably 30 of those are my various throw away accounts.
@_date: 2019-06-12 03:20:13
If bitcoin is a rabbit,  what would be the carrot?
Let me know if I'm doing this metaphor thing right.  I'm kinda new at it.
@_date: 2019-06-15 23:00:45
So what I'm getting from this is that once Bitcoin stabilizes above 9000, I don't have to look at any more Vegeta memes?
@_date: 2019-06-03 01:26:42
Do you want to attract a lot of mosquitoes? Because that's how you attract a lot of mosquitoes.
@_date: 2019-06-06 10:24:55
Bitcoin stock?
@_date: 2019-06-16 07:38:53
Try to ignore the flood of stupid bitcoin memes.
@_date: 2019-06-08 13:05:37
Or end up mugged or in prison.
@_date: 2019-02-27 03:01:04
Yep.  I don't hide money stuff from the wife.
@_date: 2019-02-26 05:11:31
Your argument is well thought out, supported and convincing. I'm in. 
@_date: 2019-02-28 20:16:53
So... I'm probably the odd man out here, but I say let's celebrate their acquisition by Coinbase. Everyone's going to hustle to make a living and maybe... HOPEFULLY... if they've found gainful employment with Coinbase they'll stop with the whole tracking journalists and dissidents stuff.
Let the downvotes commence.

One is a computer network, the other is a country.

Programmed scarcity.
No technical limitation per se, but it's intended that there be a finite supply to prevent inflation.
@_date: 2019-04-23 00:51:29
Here you go.
@_date: 2019-04-25 00:22:32
Me too! Hell, I even have a relevant username.

Assuming you are in the US...
You pay taxes on whatever gains you've made. If you sell 1btc and your profit on that 1btc is $300, you have to report that $300 as gains.
You determine the cost basis the same way you do for anything else, I would suggest Googling cost basis securities.
@_date: 2019-04-15 21:11:42
Now that I agree with.
@_date: 2019-04-22 09:53:40
Title needs more exclamation points.
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:24:22
Seems like you're being an ass rather than a "nice person, helping a stranger".
Just sayin'.

"money not liable to sudden appreciation or depreciation in value"
It most certainly does not qualify under that definition.
Not saying bitcoin isn't awesome ('cause it is) but it certainly doesn't meet any reasonable standard for "money not liable to sudden appreciation or depreciation in value".
@_date: 2019-04-15 19:33:09
This guy gets it.
My wife, brother-in-law, etc. aren't going to touch bitcoin until many of the sharp edges are removed.
Once it's easy to use (and not so easy to make crazy expensive mistakes) then we'll start to see general adoption.
@_date: 2019-04-13 15:29:41
Charge your phone.
@_date: 2019-04-30 23:35:32
Oh man, we totally need to put party hats on the blockchain.
@_date: 2018-11-21 12:39:41
The issue that you're describing has existed longer than the stock market has. Not sure you can do much to change it, or even be heard above the noise of all the memes.
@_date: 2019-05-13 18:20:46
Some life advice...
Telling people they're simple minded isn't the best way to open them to your point of view.
@_date: 2019-05-13 11:58:21
I'd be careful using the word inevitable. There's a lot that can happen with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-05-06 03:19:02
Looks like someone got photoshop for their birthday.
@_date: 2019-05-27 14:01:55
Two types of posts I hate on this sub: memes and "why did the price do X in the last Y minutes?"
Thinking about it, it's probably 80% of the posts. Drives me into an old man rage.
While I'm venting, get off my lawn.
@_date: 2019-05-05 05:29:45
Always is a long time. Just saying.
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:46:48
@_date: 2019-05-17 16:54:47
Nice high-effort post you put together here. 
How about if you're expecting people to spend time answering your question,  you provide enough information for them to do so.
@_date: 2019-05-17 10:19:13
Dude, you can't mix whales and sheep in the same metaphor. You have to use whales and minnows or wolves and sheep.

Found the real Satoshi!

While I appreciate that, my timeline is 10-20 years not 1000-2000 years.

NOT submit text about price.
@_date: 2019-05-12 17:14:05
Listen guys, you're going to drive yourself nuts checking the price and trying to validate reasons for Price movements every 4 hours.
Lengthen your horizon and then go watch a movie or cook your mom dinner or something. 
Happy Mother's Day everybody.
@_date: 2019-05-14 18:43:45
Just adding that you also are right, and now  there's nothing more to add.
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:47:28
Thanks. That link is helpful.

Waiting for my wife to notice.  :)
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:51:29
I'm with this guy.
@_date: 2019-05-17 17:23:10
Maybe take a pic of just the text and get it translated?
@_date: 2019-05-22 02:59:08
I'm thinking about taking a shower.
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:53:44
Or... there's a fire somewhere in china!

Question seems odd. Humans "care for" networks.
