This is an esoteric attack, and it's easy to detect and defend against in two different ways:
1. Miners will see the transactions and can choose not to include any conflicting transactions.
2. Relay nodes can fall back on regular block delivery when collision rates are high.

Weirdest, most long-winded argument I read in a while, from Lombrozo whose arguments are generally fairly clear.


Eventual consistency is the weakest "guarantee" one can offer. A blockchain that's never extended is eventually consistent. So the phrase "strong guarantees of eventual consistency" is non-sensical. 
The entire post boils down to "if the nodes are not running the same protocol, they are not running the same protocol, and humans will have to talk to each other to agree on the protocol." Obvious point is obvious. And the need for discussion forums, to achieve that human consensus, should also be obvious.

Your entire post, in defense of the phrase "strong guarantees of eventual consistency," shows that you're in dire need of reading up on distributed algorithms.

His "analysis," such as it is, has always been wrong. He just says middle of the road things that are thoroughly, fantastically boring. 
The root of the problem is that he actually has no expertise to share. Well-spoken but devoid of proper content.

Hey, why don't you back up your statement with evidence and prove him wrong, instead of outright talk shit about the man?

I read the whole thread. You are wrong and definition of fungibility is correct. Further, your definition is not also incorrect, but also less precise than his.

That's not how the law works. That's not how any of this works. FinCEN rules make it legal to own and transfer bitcoin. End of story. There's nothing questionable about cryptocurrencies.

Thank you for this clear-headed description. You were both correct and precise in your definitions. Your description came through clearly, probably because you're an academic and know how to define things, or possibly because the other guy is an idiot.
