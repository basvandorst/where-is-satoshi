It basically shows a lapsing interest on the demand-side of Bitcoin. The good news is that this makes Bitcoin more viable as a currency, the bad news is that the lower demand will also lower the value, and thus investors will pull out for more lucrative crypto currencies. Expect the value to drop next week.

Is that before or after taxation?

It's highly unlikely bitcoin will still be around a century from now.

All it would take is a tax regime that makes bitcoin more expensive to hold than fiat currency.

Don't gamble with money that you're not willing to lose.

It's called inflation and in moderation it's what you want for a stable economy. If people belief that their money is worth more today then it is tomorrow they are more likely to spend it on goods and services.

Nobody is an expert and everyone is having no idea what they are doing. Tomorrow crypto could go up, crypto could go down, crypto could be banned, crypto could be manipulated by any of a number of players to do whatever they want it to do. From day one this has been a gamble and anyone who says that they saw (or see) the success coming is either lying or delusional. Just ride the rollercoaster and enjoy the scenery.

What's so funny about taxes?

Praise the heavens they are, otherwise we would be right back in the stone age.

By not paying taxes you're setting yourself up for years of financial problems, possible resulting in bankruptcy and jail time. It's your own choice but I think the revolution is better off when I'm actually able to participate in it.

That's what they are doing, option b.

Taxation is theft, right? /s
