Thanks for the share

Wow, thanks Michael. Very useful.

Thanks for posting! I found the Nieto connection with BTC interesting.

Thanks for reading. It was an interesting experience that caused me more consternation than anything. I didn't talk to Carl much, but I think he's a complex personality and hopefully works out his issues and can contribute meaningfully to society in the future.

I thought it might be interesting to share this experience and get my foot in the door at Motherboard. Nice people over there. 
@_date: 2015-12-04 23:36:25
I think perhaps a bit of both? 
@_date: 2014-12-16 23:59:03
if you look at the notes closely, you might notice this is not so easy.

That this is "click-baity" is your own opinion. I've read the Reddit guidelines. There is nothing wrong with posting to your own stuff.  The whole point of this post is just to say that merchants adopting Bitcoin is bullish. Are you arguing that Newegg offering massive discounts for BTC related stuff is negative for price? Or these companies having Bitcoin logos on their websites? 
@_date: 2014-09-28 07:52:45
I am not sure the process works exactly as such. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:13:08
You're not alone, man. I JUST wrote this piece: 
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:50:15
I am definitely opened-minded towards both lines of thinking. I think we need more data to know exactly what is going on. When I started writing the article it was going to be about how PayPal is price negative for Bitcoin but I honestly wasn't convinced by the info I found this was the case. It seems more merchants accepting Bitcoin is good for demand. The Newegg sale probably caused people to buy bitcoin in order to get the discount. Regardless, lots of factors at play here. I will try to write a follow-up on this and if you have any links please share. I totally acknowledge what the price has done since the PayPal announcement, but I am not sure the cause-and-effect.

DPR is not these theoretical children's parents. But I understand your point.

The Robocoin kiosk is the size of Dr Who's fucking phone booth. And the phone booth travels through time and space. Genesis  has slicker looking stuff.

I don't think payment processors are selling over listed exchange markets.  They are fulfilling the buy orders of partners quite possibly. 
@_date: 2014-10-15 17:31:22
Oh, good point.

He is pushing for the Tenth Amendment and will in Sacramento if elected he says.

sure but it's also possible that i am a space alien.

Listen to the radio show here 
They start talking bitcoin at 58 minutes.

It is quite dangerous selling those bitcoins...

I wonder if Alex would campaign to repeal the 16th amendment...in Encinitas...
@_date: 2014-08-27 09:08:15
allegedly. Again, I see your point, however I think the above article's point makes sense too.
@_date: 2014-09-02 16:42:44
Great job, Trace. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:04:48
No. Why would you even ask!? :) 
 “I’ve made contracts irrelevant and unnecessary in my life.” 
Steve thinks we all should try this, too. And he makes a great argument for doing that in decentralize.fm's interview. I am not convinced the headline is as sensationalistic as it is not boring. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 18:43:54
headlines are headlines. Content of a post is what's most important. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 22:39:35
Dually Noted, Tony. People will likely not take kindly to how Steve views the entire complex of crypto-assets, etc. I've transcribed most of the interview and plan on doing some more stuff on it, namely using it in a longer work i've developed. This is not the end. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:01:20


Yes, but lots of what Steve says in the interview throws into question the entire nature of the contract. While it is true Steve might not totally understand a smart contract, his business acumen is clear. 
@_date: 2014-09-29 18:09:37
Agreed. Funny, too!
@_date: 2014-09-07 03:24:03
I think Alex's goal is to push for change in Sacramento first via Tenth Amendment. 
@_date: 2015-05-15 18:04:14
I'm with _DoctorMidnight on this one. I've not seen a single comment in this thread or on the cryptocoinsnews.com thread that enunciates in a cogent manner the smart contract and how it would work in "objective reality" if you will. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 20:58:48
DecentralizeTony, we should link up. I personally don't think the title is all that misleading. Perhaps a bit sensationalistic. Thanks for the interview
@_date: 2017-02-07 21:48:29
thank you! :)

What have you produced today? 
@_date: 2017-02-12 20:44:18
Colu has a colored coin model basing btc transactions in the regional currency, but its not in production. 
@_date: 2015-05-13 21:07:34
I agree 100% Bitcoinopoly. The rest of the world can learn from what people like Steve say, and perhaps p2p tech is merely a stepping stone towards that utopian world.  I think Steve  appreciates the utility of bitcoin as a transfer of value.

graph was inserted after I submitted the piece. There were also text changes made by editors. I don't think I call any redditors bitcoin core developers in the piece, but do quote people in BU's slack.

FIFA manages to have younger referees. I was just pointing out that people recommend robot umpires before younger ones.

Hello, it is linked at "long-serving podcast." But my hyperlinks are the same color as the text (not on purpose). Changing this is on my to do list.
