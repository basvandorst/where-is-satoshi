Etf kinda misses the whole point of controlling your money and financial sovereignty. If anything, it’s another oneramp for the wealthy to manipulate price and try to shake out your weak hands. People in this sub who want an etf literally just want a short term pump with no regard to anything else. That said, I think they’ll probably approve one within a year or two because btc is getting so popular.

Bitcoin core is a client that is compatible with the bitcoin protocol that existed before the fork. 
Bitcoin cash is a different protocol that requires different clients (e.g. Bitcoin ABC). It is not backwards compatible to the system before the fork.

An easier way to add this same redundancy would be to get a single trezor with a pass phrase. Memorize your phrase and write the seed words down multiple times. The seed can’t access your keys without the phrase so you can put the seed in a few different safe locations. If your device dies, just buy a new one and restore. This will give you the redundancy you’re looking for without having to buy multiple devices and also without leaving an unencrypted seed laying around.

People who don’t like bitcoin do mental gymnastics to convince themselves it’s too expensive... my last transaction I set the fee at 2sat/byte so it was $0.035 in fees and it made it in the next block. I probably got a little lucky with that one to be fair.

With Robinhood you don’t have access to your private keys. Because bitcoin is based on public/private key cryptography, you won’t actually gain any access to use the network.
Bitcoin was created (among other reasons) to give people back control of their own money. Robinhood follows the old system of having a 3rd party control your money for you.

Harvesting hate-clicks for ad revenue is one of the more viable business models for online journalism today. For example this article is deliberately inflammatory probably because people tend to share content that makes them angry. Ironically, it is possible that bitcoin could solve this problem with more frictionless micropayments over the lightning network (see yalls.org) offering a new business model where you could monetize good content.

Im just saying, to block you from the network somebody would need to block you from creating any channels to any sufficiently funded nodes which doesn’t seem realistic. You are right, controlling your own bitcoin keys and running a full node is the ultimate security. If bitcoin becomes more successful, owning the keys will be very important for securing your wealth. There is simply not enough room for 7 billion people on the chain - I don’t think anybody is claiming that. Nobody thinks bitcoin can match visas transactions per second so you should sell if you think that will cause the project to fail.

We’ll probably end up with custodial wallets where the average person doesn’t ever go onchain or open their own lightning channels. From my experience, most people don’t care at all about how any of this works underneath the front end user experience.

Maybe you bought in in the last hype cycle or listened to people who didn’t know what they were talking about. Nobody who understands the protocol would claim that you could do tens of thousands of transactions per second on layer one. I’ve been buying bitcoin since 2014 and I do believe it will be the new monetary standard but it’s gonna take some time and it will be scaling in layers. The beauty of the open source code is that people make it better and better every day. A year or two from now there will be new things built on top of the btc protocol that you or I couldn’t even think of today. That’s why it’s best to have a stable protocol that people can use as a platform.
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:08:22
Truth. It just makes me nervous to not hold the keys myself so I always try to withdraw asap.
@_date: 2019-01-03 16:01:15
Proof of keys is just some arbitrary day. I wouldn’t factor it into decision making process. Be prepared to lose all coins that you don’t hold the keys for. If the “returns” aren’t being sent to you in the form of bitcoin you have no way of knowing if the service is being honest with you. I could easily make a website that would show you nice returns right up until the day I shut off my web server and bounce.
@_date: 2019-01-04 15:03:44

It’s different because you have the option to be your own bank if you want to (and if you’ve reserved some room for yourself on the blockchain), another difference would be that no central authority can inflate away your value by printing money because the underlying asset is still trust-less.

Basically just do some research before putting your hard earned money into anything. Bitcoin cash is different from Bitcoin with different consensus rules and vision. It is a project that some people are working on/believe in, although a lot of people market it as the “real” bitcoin which is deceitful because it isn’t. I personally think BTC has a better roadmap for lots of reasons, but especially because networks generally scale in layers rather than all on the same layer. (Think of the tcp Internet protocol). But yeah, people will always want you to buy into their coin because the more people on the network the better for them, that’s why it’s best to think about it for yourself, good luck!

Even if something extreme happened, like the fed wanting to capitulate and exit the dollar. I don’t think it would be possible to buy more than 1 million bitcoins at this point max. Most bitcoins are locked in cold storage by people who don’t want to buy fiat. Only a fraction of the supply is traded.

Bitcoin is actually extremely easy to track. Every transaction is public info that will be recorded forever and potentially audited in the future. If you are looking for something that can’t be tracked, you should probably use physical dollars. Unless you’re really tech savvy and want to try a privacy coin.

If it hits 100k then you would need 10btc to be a millionaire. There’s probably less or equal to 1 million people holding 10+ btc considering the amount lost and the early adopters sitting on larger stacks restricting the supply.

With a million dollars you could still get like 170 bitcoins though and that’s a lot
@_date: 2018-12-14 04:47:17
Its possible, if somebody really wanted to inconvenience the network. To push and hold the fees up to $10, you could spam the chain with $10 transactions. Assuming 7tps that would cost about $6million per day. So yeah definitely possible if somebody owned a lot of bitcoin and was strongly interested in slowing down the network for a bit. You could probably always outbid them though and open up a channel or two on lightning
@_date: 2018-12-21 13:35:40

It seems like a 2008 type event is probably coming... so maybe proportionally the same as that but with bigger numbers? Tough to know....interest rates are a lot lower now so that’s going to be one less tool the fed has to use if the bottom falls out. On the other hand, maybe the bottom falls out on the dollar which could cause the dollar value of stocks to go up a lot. All I know is that I’m bullish on bitcoin and unsure about everything else.
@_date: 2018-12-30 16:28:47

Uber is not a profitable company. They continue to raise more and more venture capital to finance their operations and use the new money to raise the share price for earlier investors. There is no path to profitability and the IPO is the final phase of raising money. From this point, they will need to find a profitable business to engage in or they will go bankrupt. I wouldn’t trade my bitcoin for Uber shares.
