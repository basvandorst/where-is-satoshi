A block chain where the reward is constantly 50 bitcoins without ever halving will still have an inflation rate that tends to 0% as time goes on. A block chain where the reward is 50 bitcoins and increases by 0.01 bitcoins each block will *still* have an inflation rate that tends to 0%. A block chain where the reward starts at 50 bitcoins, increases by 0.01 bitcoins each block, and has that increase rate go up by 0.01 bitcoins every 100 blocks will yet again have an inflation rate that tends to 0%.
The decision to have a hard cap had nothing to do with trying to have a manageable inflation rate; it was a decision to have a hard cap to emulate the finiteness of gold.
That being said, I'm also in the "it was a bad idea" camp, but I'm in the "it was just plain stupid and there really was no excuse for it" camp.

True. Which also invalidates the rhetorical argument that Mac is as "free" as Linux just because it runs on a kernel that's a derivative of a freely-licensed one.

I was more countering the rhetoric that Rectores was spewing that "because Mac runs on a FreeBSD kernel, it somehow escapes the 'lack of freedom' argument".
Also, perhaps all *your* data is portable (and so is mine), but a lot of people who use Microsoft's integrated services don't have that luxury. So to them, it's not "free" as you describe it.

Normally arbitration and retribution are very hard-nosed, coarse ways of dealing with problems. Have there been successful private forms of mediation and restorative practices as well?


No party-based, centralized government, perhaps. List a few examples of what you mean by "no government".


Depends on what government, and what form of murder you're thinking of.


Certainly there'd be slightly *more* chaos, as there are indeed many people in the world who behave only because the rules tell them to.

It's not actually infinitely divisible. It's "practically infinite" only because nobody's ever had to use 100-millionths of any currency unit before.
They could change the algorithm to accommodate more decimal places, I suppose, but that can only go so far (up to 11 places without overflowing a 64-bit integer, which is the way they're stored now).

Of course. What I mean is that there are better ways to resolve disputes before resorting to arbitration and retributive justice, even if they don't work all the time. (Because, well, neither do arbitration and retributive justice.)


If that "monopoly" were *actually* run by the people, I don't think there'd be too much of a problem. But you're right that a government bought out by lobbyists (a monopoly, as you say) and such will be ineffective.


I think a private, competitive market for justice would probably have more biased arbiters and less reported crimes, even ones with victims. What sort of motive would these companies have to stand for any inherent set of values, and not also be bribed one way or another? Remember that both honest and dishonest parties brand themselves as honest, and you might not get the full picture even talking to everybody.


I said mediation and restorative practices (that bring the two conflicting parties together to make the resolution themselves), not arbitration. I know you have a lot of arbitration and what have you.


Oh, you meant in wars! Excuse me, I'm being stupid. I thought you were referring to the lack of universal health care (or even widespread private medical practice) being a slow fire to the population or their economic policy causing millions to go penniless and starve to death or the death penalty or something.
(Had you not continued after "how does this matter", I would not have stood corrected. Thank you for going that extra mile with your explanation. I know quite a few people who wouldn't, as if they were afraid of insulting my intelligence.)


Yeah, I get what you're talking about there.


First of all, I wouldn't believe that most people would be able to afford such services absent of a government to provide it to them. If you believe that's their own problem, fine. But what measures would those private defense agencies or law enforcement agencies compete on? How much justice is served? How much they charge for their services?
Would a private law enforcement company go the extra mile to convict somebody who was innocent, just because they were being paid enough to do it? And what happens if the two parties can't agree on an arbitration service to use? How would that even be enforced? How can you be sure that neither you nor the private law enforcement company is acting unfairly? You say no government doesn't mean no rules, but who makes the rules? Can you even be sure the rules will be the same? What's okay in one country isn't okay in another; do we really want that to apply to the neighbourhood level as well?
Both public and private law can go horribly wrong in practice. It all depends on the people running the system and what motives they have.


I think that would be because I'm not American. If this subreddit is mostly America-centered, I'm sorry if that made you make assumptions about the point of view I'm working with. Personally, I find pledging allegiance to just a flag, instead of the country that flag represents, abhorrent. It's blatant idolatry and an abuse of symbolism, and I'm glad I was never subjected to it by going to school in the US.


Please enlighten my un-Americanness. Which dead rulers are we talking about? The Founding Fathers?


I personally think the bigger issue is apathy. The consumerist Americans have their bread and circuses.

Why does it matter that the object is physical? The relation of intent is what matters.

I think I'll place a buy order for 100 bitcoins at $1 apiece (or for 10,000 bitcoins at $0.01 apiece), for exactly when this scenario happens. If the price never gets that low, no big loss. If the price gets that low and never goes back up, $100 is no big loss either.

Actually, I wasn't really referring to the "gambler" part when I commented on your username and its relevance to the comment. The name just seemed representative of the kind of junkyism that Bitcoin is known for, calling yourself a "gambler" because you're betting on bitcoins, "anon" because Bitcoin is an "anonymous" currency, and, well, "bitcoin" because Bitcoin.
You'll notice that the part I quoted didn't even reference gambling at all. I apologize if the reference seemed unclear.


Eh, I'm not really one to use derogatory nicknames. I was just linking to the site since you mentioned the name. I always call them "Bitcoin" and "bitcoins" myself.


As long as I have to. If Bitcoin really does find the widespread public acceptance it was looking for, I will admit my mistake and join in with the rest of the public crowd. But it'll take a lot to convince me to prefer bitcoins over more traditional speculative investments such as gold and silver.
