I didn't notice. Maybe they charge for higher amounts, since mine was quite small.

I intend to spend my money on Skrill since I can't withdraw or spend it on anything else. Is local bitcoins worthy? Also, what difference does it make if I buy BTC locally instead of from seller that offers for lowest possible price?

I don't keep them there, I immediately transfer them after buying, but I've noticed they charge nothing to transfer. That's why I was wondering...

You're right. Good point.

I gave you an idea, huh? :)

Payment returns? Based on what excuse? Why 90 days?

Fantastic! I wonder how can people sell anything on that site... Would they sue me for cca 40$ (and also, I'm not American, I live in E Europe)?
edit: Unbelieveable!

Isn't this a contradiction?
@_date: 2016-04-29 16:23:17
But it's profitable...

NINETY DAYS??? I wonder why those people who sell still sell on eBay... How did they not get fucked over by this scam? I will never ever sell BTCs there again! Wait, what if I spend all the money on my account, how can they charge if I remove all cards? What can they do to me?

I don't think I understood half of what you just wrote.

Question: If they give positive feedback, do they have the right to claim that they didnt get the item? It wouldn't make sense. Maybe they could claim that their account was hacked, as one tried, and failed. But I dont see any other ways to scam sellers...
