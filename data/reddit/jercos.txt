An effective way to buy pizza.

A GET request could be stored in browser history, and could result in passwords being dumped into server logs unhashed, allowing a compromise of either client or server to reveal the password with no MitM shenanigans needed.

I bought a guy a pizza. :|

Yeah, at the time the cost of a couple pizzas seemed pretty large when compared to something that could be mined in a few days on a handful of computers CPU-mining. We've come so far since then.

Pizza is delicious. You can't eat bitcoin!

It's harder to eat Bitcoin than it is to eat pizza.

Is true.

Sadly, no. Those coins were sold mere months later, at perhaps 20x the value of the pizzas. I expected Bitcoin to become a successful currency, but didn't expect the massive growth in value. While I've profited from holding onto some coins, I also lost a large amount to Mt. Gox, and to the collapse of other exchanges and marketplaces.

I invested a couple of pizzas in Bitcoin around then.

Very much so.

Hi yes, I am a jercos.

Yup, only one I know of.

In a chaotic world, Pizza is the only truly stable currency.
