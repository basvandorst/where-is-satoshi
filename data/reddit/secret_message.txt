You win, bro. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:35:46
Hope you left it on Coinbase...
@_date: 2018-01-03 19:38:46
Left them on Coinbase and didn't sell. We both won!
@_date: 2014-10-06 01:06:09
Done. Which mall?
@_date: 2014-10-05 21:18:59
Why so bearish?
@_date: 2017-08-02 15:17:23
Go ahead, vote me down. But they are holding back the sellers at the gates while they pump the price up. It's called a pump and dump... and as soon as they open the gates the dump will commence.

Except no one has been able to sell BCH. The exchanges are not allowing deposits of BCH, so the price is going up due to no sells... totally price manipulation.
@_date: 2017-08-10 04:08:24
Down 50% in a week...
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:24:06
Who cares? BCC is going to be worthless.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:10:30
No, it's not.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:09:35
What data do you have to support that?
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:04:28
Cap gains taxes 
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:08:20
What if I told you that I have absolutely zero connection to Coinbase?
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:17:26
If it's worthless, then the BTC is a trivial amount that is probably less than what I earn per hour doing other things. It's a literal waste of time. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:42:09
...or maybe i believe in Coinbase's ability to protect my coins more than my ability to not lose my wallet or keys. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:19:20
The second trading opens up, it'll be a race between trading algos to dump their BCC as fast as possible so they're not holding the bag. Humans and retails investors will be stuck with worthless BCC. Meanwhile, I'll be working on my day job and day trading BTC... making money. 
...and the assholes, like assholes before them, who made the altcoin will get rich. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:43:21
Agreed on buying opportunity. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:15:38
Waste of time.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:39:54
3 years in a row now. ��
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:14:36
There's no reason for it to drop though. Did BTC drop when any other altcoin was created? No.
@_date: 2017-07-28 16:11:56
Don't touch your bitcoins. Do not listen to these pumpers.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:08:03
When you get audited every year, you learn to follow the law. Don't worry, you'll get enough BTC to get the IRS's attention some day too...
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:12:37
It's unreadable on mobile 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:08:45
What valuation is that?
