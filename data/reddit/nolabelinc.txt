Bitoasis is quite cool, use them here as Dubai resident.
Dubai government is generally very advance and had their own e currency for all govt transactions for years now.
Also unlike other govts whobsre afraid of tax implications of bitcoin no such proboem exists here since no taxes exist here.

I really dont get why they wouldnt release it everywhere with btc donation requests. It interviews the right people which is a good start

That's interesting. I am in Dubai and was contemplating some similar experiments. My concern is the cooling costs.

No offence but that's some entry level advice.  Doesn't work when you are in the triple digits

Yea I'm feeling that too. Somehow I imagined seeing a big fat stash of fiat feel better than it does

Yea it's annoying

Thanks guys! Found it. Idea scrapped.

They stopped as far as I know

Well, the main issue is payments.
I can't "hold " a room. I can basically buy it or not, it's binary.
Since there is a delay with transactions of between minutes and hours it's not feasible to book until I am certain I have received payments, thus creating an internal wallet is essential.
Thus it must have an account to control it.
Also how to view your bookings? Still need an email etc

@_date: 2017-06-29 16:17:29
They rank for the term but when I go to currency I don't see 
Moreover I searched and searched but couldn't find an actual  price anywhere or a checkout page. Help?
