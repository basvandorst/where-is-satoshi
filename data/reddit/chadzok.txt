totally one-sided news and information. keep a critical eye.

To offer a different perspective, those who have invested the time to study or are actively working in the area might be more prone to biases such as echo chamber/sunk cost.
To continue the analogy of a crappy channel, the Jamie Dimon story was 'covered' in this sub as an extreme example of a fool who was either totally wrong or completely deceptive. To hold that up as an example of the opposing viewpoint makes it very easy to dismiss anything that disagrees with your opinions.
I'm not opposed to trusting in expertise; science wouldn't go anywhere without standing on the shoulders of prior knowledge.

Propaganda swings both ways, my friend. I'd be interested to hear what the specifics of your epic battle with corporate attack looks like.
As lame as it is, I looked through your post history. Not a whole lot of technical conversation, mainly meme application and calling things 'FUD' - particularly when they disagree with you.

I’m not ‘looking’ for anything. But if the news is always good, you’re watching a shitty channel.

There’s a difference between ‘FUD’ and a healthy skepticism. That kind of attitude makes for echo chambers which will drown out potentially relevant information. If your beliefs/investments are based on solid ground then there’s no harm to be done by testing them against critique.
