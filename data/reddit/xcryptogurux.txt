Exactly why it's game over for bcash by mid 2018. BTG is a way better fork than bcash with an actual purpose - ASIC resistance. I absolutely abhor ASICs, it has only served to centralize mining. bcash has no long-term value proposition.

Having first come across Bitcoin nearly a decade ago, I'm happy to regale you with tales or engage in a discussion about the timeless merits of blockchain.
However, I'd NEVER beseech anybody to put their money in it. Only a select few are bestowed with the sagacity to peer past the price of emerging assets. This aptitude cannot be communicated to those with skin in the game for fiat profits.
Sophisticated price manipulation machinations across the market are also far too overwhelming for new hands to get their heads around and they invariably end up taking a bath.

The only issue of centralization in Bitcoin is parallel processing\(mining pools\). This is something which can be easily addressed. Bitcoin is capable of becoming resistant to parallel processing. ASICs and mining pools are the worst thing that ever happened to Bitcoin.

You're saying the same thing I did, that centralized services compromise Bitcoin, after arguing for centralized services. How about you make your mind up first?

That you, as someone who's apt to pontificate on the function of centralized Bitcoin services, are not aware of non-custodial decentralized exchanges sadly exemplifies the deviation and normalization of the centralized compromise that can only be addressed through education.

Wait, you know what I'm worth? Hello, IRS. Fancy seeing you here!
Now since you mentioned rich/poor dichotomy of corporate capitalism,
The system, which we're inexplicably saddled with in this digital age, has always been ill-conceived, especially so for the last 48 yrs after the US unilaterally withdrew from Bretton Woods and instituted a debt-financed monetary system with limitless free money for those closest to issuers and eternal inflation fobbed off as an additional tax on the taxpayers.
What they're trying to do now is water down the digital revolution in money by pushing centralized iterations of Bitcoin as "safer" alternatives, which will allow them to retain control of monetary supply and perpetuate the fiat fiasco on the blockchain.
It's a shame that the ones whom the system benefits the most are those we allow the power to change it. But with Bitcoin, it doesn't need to be that way and it's frustrating that people don't get it. It's hard to blame them as they've been conditioned to being in thrall to central authorities and don't know it any other way.
Bitcoin's fate rests not in the hands of governments or central banks, it doesn't matter whether or not they approve of Bitcoin. It lies in educating people about this simple truth.
@_date: 2019-11-07 10:21:36
How is that an indictment of Bitcoin?
Coinbase is a centralized TTP service built around Bitcoin, a decentralized peer-to-peer network, built to function as a monetary system per se.
These centralized legacy services defeat the point of Bitcoin. You're giving for-profit entities, not dissimilar to conventional private banks, leverage to not only play the market with your money, but also mismanage your money the same way banks do.
This is exactly what I mean when I talk about educating people.
@_date: 2018-06-23 12:21:31
Not universally true. I've spent and will always continue to spend but not interested in selling out to fiat, ever. There's no point cashing out to paper money unless you really need fiat/you're only in it to make fiat profits.

To familiarise with Bitcoin payments. It's a great feeling, probably difficult to communicate to someone who only seens Bitcoin as a SoV, which is what it's going to be until satoshis become UoA.

Bitpay is one of the startups backed by Ver. They blatantly shill Bcash and practice highly questionable fee structures to make it seem like Bcash is free to use and Bitcoin is not. I wouldn't recommend using Bitpay.

At the time of writing this, there are 1626... sorry... 1627... beg your pardon... 1628 shitcoins
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:25:24
The first blockchain layer of BTC allows it to be used as a SoV. BTC now has a secondary layer for instant payments, which is currently a network of over 6000 nodes for routing payments without using the blockchain layer for every transaction.
If internet relied on just one layer, it would be too cumbersome and impracticable to connect the entire world to a single network. Internet relies on 5 major layers to achieve 'scaling' \- Physical layer, Data layer, Network layer, Transport layer and Application layer.
You don't need to understand all of these to use the Internet. Similarly, you don't need to understand the various layers of Bitcoin to use it. Bitcoin, in the future, will not only support simple scripting for payments but also advance scripting features will be implemented across multiple\-layers to support various applications.
Those who understand this inevitability stick to Bitcoin. Those who, in their wisdom, think a new coin could ever achieve the level of trust, notoriety, robustness, FUD\-resistance that it took Bitcoin 10 years to establish hold shitcoin bags and shill it.
Besides, all these other coins can be easily assailed and shut\-down if push comes to shove. No matter which government 'bans' Bitcoin, nobody can actually destroy Bitcoin or stop you from using it. The genius of Satoshi was not only in creating Bitcoin but stepping away from it forever and leaving it in our hands.

Yes, but some goods, often virtual goods, are also priced in bitcoins. The value will stabilize with greater adoption.

Welcome on board! Buying Bitcoin with money you can afford to dispense with is the absolute right approach. Don't keep looking at the dollar/pound price 10 times a day. Try spending small amounts of bitcoins where it's accepted.
Also, don't just own bitcoins, get acquainted with the basics of Bitcoin \- [

I'm loathe to talk about this chancing ch\*nk. If you own the majority of hashpower on the network, you think you can own the network. He sure owns Bcash and can do what he wants with it.
FWIW, I saw this coming 4 years ago. Bitmain's ultimate goal has always been to seize control of Bitcoin. I used to mine bitcoins back in the day but quit mining since the ASIC invasion. Worst thing to happen to Bitcoin by a long chalk.
For Bitcoin to truly move forward and realize global adoption, we've got to rid Bitcoin of this pervasive, harrowing, consumptive influence.
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:42:44
Yes we are but you don't have to worry about that. You're buying small amounts with what you can afford to lose. Don't listen to people who claim to know where bottom and top are. Rest assured that in a few years' time, your 50 pounds worth will be worth a lot more. Bank of England prints over 3 billion pounds a year, only 700k bitcoins were mined in the last year.

The only problem with decentralized/non-custodial exchanges is lack of liquidity.
The only way to solve that is by moving funds en masse out of custodial exchanges to non-custodial exchanges. Personally, I haven't used a custodial exchange this year.
Bitcoin is not Bitcoin when nearly all active, circulating supply is locked up in the hands of a few central entities. It's not trustless, it's not peer-to-peer and it's sure as hell not secure.

Significant support at 7k. Also, if you were to chart a rational, secular bullish progression over a 6-8 month period, we'd be around that mark.
In Jan-Feb 2017, most people wondered if Bitcoin would double in value by the end of the year. Despite all the attacks, contentious forks and altcoin/ICO bubble, see where it finished the year.
Nobody did but say, you called Bitcoin 19k valuation by end of year in Feb 2017. Imagine the reaction.
Likewise, it's not a great moment right now to make bullish calls but it's a moment in time and it will pass.
The technology is in a better place than it was at ATH valuation. That's all that really matters.

You seem to have no idea if you're arguing in or against favour of technology determining long-term value. Technology matters insofar as determining whether an asset is likely to appreciate AND retain value long-term. If you read the original post, you'll find that's precisely the point being made.
Yet, you argued that technology really doesn't matter and now you don't? Make your mind up, fella!

I understand people who bought high being miffed at this very moment, it is a moment in time, but I cannot stress enough how reassuring it is to have been through it. The attacks Bitcoin has survived in the last 7 years should have killed it if it were to die.
If you believe in the immeasurable value of a decentralized economy, you invested responsibly for that reason, you shouldn't overly worry about corrections.
If you invested to make fiat profits, you're welcome to sell but just know that the underlying technology is better than when you invested, even if it was a month ago.

Bitcoin had 2 limitations, scaling and ASICs. All educated wisdom regarding blockchain points to second-layer scaling as the most practical long-term recourse for scaling.
Bcash not only perpetuates ASICs but promotes centralization of the network under Bitmain's auspices.

The Bitcoin network owns Bitcoin. Bcash network(aka Bitmain), which is not much of a network to speak of, owns Bcash.
Roger Ver took money and vouched for Gox's solvency after it was already insolvent for almost a year. Gox cost people in the network 850,000 bitcoins. What did he care? Did he pay off those investors with the money Gox paid him? Now he's messing with people's money again.

1 - Sure, but non-consensual minority forks can never claim to be Bitcoin. Bcash is a Bitmain project.
2 - Nothing to do with trademark and everything to do with cynical, deceptive, disgusting and exploitative practices intended to take advantage of the ignorant and innocent.
3 - Bitcoin is BTC. A forked coin is whatever the minority that forked the chain wants to call it but NOT Bitcoin.
4 - Bitcoin has evolved, like all inventions which have stood the test of time - telephone, television, internet... Nothing could be further from Satoshi's design than Bitmain coin with majority full nodes under direct or indirect control of Bitmain. Bitcoin diverged from the original design when ASICs emerged.
5 - Any minority fork claiming to be Bitcoin and propagating lies to the effect is impersonating Bitcoin. Why? Because without trying to steal the Bitcoin name, it would have exactly ZERO value.

Decentralized apps will not happen without a decentralized economy. As for why Bcash is a scam.. it's a Bitmain fork of Bitcoin to centralize and perpetuate ASIC monopoly, shilled by a group of veritable frauds, shysters and sock puppets. Pretty much all Bcash full nodes are under direct or proxy control of Bitmain, which is also why they achieve ready consensus on 32 mb or even future 1 tb blocks.

No, that's not how it was meant. No one person or group of people within the network owns Bitcoin, the entire network does in the sense that is belongs to everybody. Bitcoin is the original chain and the chain with consensus. Bcash is a non-consensual minority fork actuated by Bitmain.
You actually make a good point at the end for why Ver has no right to mess with your Bitcoin or mine... our Bitcoin. He's engaging in social engineering laced with disinformation and deceit to take over Bitcoin and it's not the first time he has tried it.

I'm also sending some material on Roger's past brushes with the law, his previous conviction, while also exploring whether he could even be sued for taking money from Mt Gox to vouch for them when it has since been revealed, by Mark himself, that Mt Gox was already insolvent at the time and trying to paper over some very huge cracks.

@_date: 2018-04-23 20:44:38
I don't give a rat's arse about minority forks either but a minority fork can never claim to be Bitcoin, much less one where pretty much all full nodes are controlled by one entity. Bcash is a Bitmain project to centralize Bitcoin and it's going to end very badly for the crooks.
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:17:38
Self-policing is calling on the carpet and punishing deliberately underhand, deceptive and fraudulent practices such as shown in this very picture.
The crooks behind Bcash are calling their centralized minority-forked altcoin Bitcoin. If this were to be let go without punishment, that's an indictment of decentralization, for plagiarism and deceit entail serious consequences in the real world.

No and learn why
In Bitcoin's nascency, the blockchain size was small, few people used it and anyone could mine with CPUs, there were no ASICs.
Since you know Satoshi implemented the block size limit, I also expect you to know why it was implemented.
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:08:25
4 times actually. We're not talking about block generation time. Litecoin blockchain size is a fraction of Bitcoin's(&lt; 10%)
@_date: 2018-04-24 01:32:59
It's called evolution. Bitcoin needs to evolve. If it tries to be faithful to Satoshi's ideas, it cannot evolve. Satoshi hasn't had an idea since 2011 and we're in 2018.
But just to debunk the tedious nonsense bcash shills keep parroting, 32 mb blocks, centralized full nodes, ASICs and DDA are the furthest from the real Bitcoin.
If limitless block size is the answer, why are all other altcoins adopting second layer scaling like Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-01 00:15:06
Yes sir! In thrall to sharp power.
@_date: 2018-04-25 00:06:46
Talking about block size as pertains to cost of operating a full node. DAG is not a blockchain. IOTA's version of it is not even decentralized yet. Presumably Ripple? Why do you presume? lol. Ripple is a centralized protocol where the gateways and Ripple Inc. operate all 'validator' nodes.
What's said for Litecoin would also be true for Bitcoin but again, that's not big blocks, just a technological evolution in economizing use of block space which is very healthy practice and will continue to evolve.
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:16:27
Because pretty much all full nodes on Bcash network are under Bitmain's direct/indirect control. There will never be a non-consensual upgrade of Bcash.

@_date: 2018-04-24 01:45:21
You really think 1 TB blocks should be 'explored' as the long-term solution to scale permissionless blockchains? Seriously?
Guess why no other coin except Bitmain wants big blocks?
It is accepted wisdom now that second layer scaling is THE long-term solution. Why else do you think all the altcoins are looking to adopt it now?

He's promoting a minority-forked altcoin as 'Bitcoin', which constitutes fraud and is actionable tortfeasance.
Btw, that's just one charge. He can also be charged with collusion with Mt Gox to defraud investors. It cost investors 850,000 bitcoins. It has been revealed since that Mt Gox had been insolvent long before the 'I've seen proof.. not lack of liquidity' avouchment.
Roger's rake's progress makes it easy to enumerate a litany of charges which would ensure that he never ever messes with Bitcoin again.

It's not called DoS attacks but to prevent spamming tx, yes. Big blocks make it impossible for standalone miners to run full nodes. It's not a problem for Bitmain coin. They run all full nodes. Bitcoin actually needs to rid itself of ASICs to become fully decentralized again.
He conceded that it will not suffice when the network gets bigger, whereupon solutions may be considered. Satoshi is not an authority on Bitcoin in 2018. 2010 Satoshi couldn't say what do to with Bitcoin in 2018. Although Satoshi is the inventor, Bitcoin is adapting and evolving with time like all great inventions, it's a human project, it's a decentralized project, definitely not a Bitmain project.
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:20:59
Lol ofcourse. I was just talking about Bcash right now.
The infinite money came from Bitcoin, not from those jury-rigged explosives or the computer hardware shop. Mt Gox paid him a pony sum for the avouchment even as investors lost 850,000 bitcoins.

Is there any other big-block altcoin? No, because no altcoin is dumb enough to be blatantly centralized.

If Bcash fails to find enough dumbasses to convince that they're 'the real Bitcoin', there's no Plan B.
