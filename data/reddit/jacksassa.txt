Anything that takes money out of the pockets of Bitcoiners. That's what all these companies are doing and it seems to work well.

He has absolutely no clue what he's talking about. He just randomly adds stuff as he goes. 
Nothing but ridiculous conspiracies and fantasies based on pretty much nothing.

You think the NSA stole your coins?? Wtf?
Every day when i think people in this sub can't get any crazier someone proves me wrong.

Notice how pretty much every "answer" you give is downvoted? Maybe it's time to step back for a minute and wonder why this is happening. 
Let me give you a hint: You're full of yourself, you're arrogant, constantly wrong and filled with teenage rage. It's not a nice combination. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 22:53:53
This is so ridiculous i'm not even gonna discuss it. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 17:06:06
Why don't you just answer him instead? I would also like to see the answers to his questions. Even more now that you ignored it. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 19:28:39
The latter.

How many coins did you buy today? 
@_date: 2015-04-26 23:00:55
Many here fail to realize that the rest of the world outside of this sub doesn't give a shit about Bitcoin. That's 7 billion people. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 17:25:07
Someone dumped some coins to make profit. Probably the same person who pumped it last week at 215. 
There is your explanation. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 23:09:13
Dude, it's been posted 20 times days ago. And the original article was full of inflated numbers. As with every "this is huge!" news it did nothing to the price so nobody gives a shit anymore.

6 years is not early. Especially with technology. 
Hilarious all the downvoting. As if my statement isn't true. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 21:36:42
Never wrong? You're joking right?

You are suggesting banks are trying to figure out how much not buying a few 1000 coins would cost them in case the price goes up?
I don't think you have a clue how big banks are and how much money they have and how Bitcoin compares to that.
