Faucets are BS. Don't waste your time.

imagine all this fortune in bitcoins.. 
they could never put their hands on it.

Most of these wallets are business, and it's only the beginning, it should spread with time.

i'd say it is brazil specific problem
used to sell stuff and brazil post is worst and most corrupt in the world, many packages can be tracked till they arrive brazil and then they dissapear
if you have option to use ups/dhl/fedex/ems when you get package in hand it is most secure cause brazil post worst than bermuda triangle

There are many services who provide fake documents of every king with every information you want, receipts are probably easiest to fake.
Trading unreversible for reversible funds you must always get the money first not matter how persuasive they are, eventually this is how scammers make money, by lying.

it happens before confirmations, and anyway they should not allow use coins before confirmation, after confirming transactions all these issues are gone.
mtgox is not the only exchange, all other exchanges deal with this successfully without any problems.

no physical address on website, wordpress, co.il = israel, under his mother name?

not sure if its a scam but i am sure it is unprofessional and that's enough for me to not give them my money/

Hi all, I'm new user on reddit.
What is the problem with news posts?
It's all new and not double post, and I get many karma.
Please explain.

bureaucracy sucks but that's nothing compared to them seizing money in your account.
@_date: 2014-02-25 08:43:00
first deposits were more than week ago and most from same accounts, probably owners coins.

@_date: 2014-01-14 00:52:04
I think the obvious points are enough,
prepare good answers to stupid questions like bitcoin is for illegal stuff and such.
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:04:27
Except US Dollar in paper cash sounds a solid investment,
I'd rather invest those 20% in alternate crypto currencies, cause if at least one of them skyrockets it will cover the others.
@_date: 2014-02-10 13:32:59
this "issue" known from 2011,
problem only with unconfirmed transaction,
bitcoin built to deal with it in the first place.
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:59:28
Don't worry, it's not only you, they just ignore everybody.
After reading all the horror stories I thought better to go through the verification process before transferring them anything, sent all the documents more than a month ago and no response till this moment. Guess if my money was there they would ignore me the same way.
The term "GOXED" has not come for no reason.

Try bitcoin armory, it's friendlier and more secure.
@_date: 2014-01-13 19:47:36
check genesis block calculator its more accurate
@_date: 2014-02-01 16:06:21
to check if people use bitcoin in certain country i check localbitcoins.com, there is only one ad in Belarus so i guess bitcoin not popular there

They are not verified scam, I thought maybe I'll be one of the lucky people who successfully withdraw money from there but apparently I'm not.
@_date: 2014-01-14 13:15:37
Despite its a big store, still its only a store started accepting bitcoin, no major breakthrough.
News is not enough to get a price going, if after those news many people would buy tons of bitcoin then price will go up, meanwhile nothing major happened to make more people buying more coins.
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:54:01
people who own bitcoin want price rise to profit,
people not owning bitcoin want price to fall to get in or to confirnm their assumption its a bubble,
both consider it legitimate cause otherwise there were not so much money in, and because of facts that it is usable and has value
@_date: 2014-02-08 13:14:07
when you create wallet with email, blockchain sends backup by default, and this backup becomes the weakest link in wallet security cause if this file stolen you loose your wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-05 11:25:48
bitcoin nor karpeles have nothing to do with your stupidity.
what you call 'investing' it is actually gambling and if not bitcoin you would loose your money somewhere else and than what? you would blame this something else just not yourself..
investing is putting sum of money which will not ruin you if you loose it, not going all in.
conclusion: being idiot does'ny pay.

Maybe it will work with small payments, but the big ones will need confirmations.
Also seller can insist for at least one confirmation even for a small payment.

My PC is not private, and it can be stolen and I'm not security expert so I keep my coins on several online wallets with 2FA
In my case I feel this is more secured
@_date: 2014-02-28 14:49:52
even if it is stolen most of it will be cashed out or used to purchase so thieves will not hold it for long, easy comes easy goes.

even if you are correct, still it is better than fiat
