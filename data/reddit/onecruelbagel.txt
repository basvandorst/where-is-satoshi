I'm playing on GDAX, so as long as I stick with limit orders there aren't any fees. I'm feeling a bit frustrated with ETH at the moment as it's still trending downwards compared to BTC, but I'm hoping it'll catch back up again. I think this is largely because BTC has done really well the last few days and ETH hasn't, so it'll probably switch around soon. I hope.

I think you're right and I am still hodling. It's half way back to where I bought already (0.039 BTC/ETH, bought at about 0.043). I'm learning I don't have the mentality for day trading - I keep trying to cut my losses too soon. Or I sell too late.

I do see what you mean - the amount I've invested, I'd be upset if I lost it, but I wouldn't be in financial trouble, so I can afford to leave it there for a while. Maybe the answer is to leave half of it permanently and not touch it, and try trading up and down the dips with the rest... I suspect I might make less overall though, so perhaps there's no point. 
I'm arguing myself in circles... Perhaps I should just try it!

I've been wondering about that... Currently all the money I have on the exchange is tied up in BTC, so unless I sell some (or put more in, but I feel I've put in as much as is wise - don't invest what you can't afford to lose, etc) I don't have any money available to buy on the dips.
So, given that BTC's general trend is upwards, why haven't you invested all the money you've assigned to it - how come you have some spare? Do you reckon you make better profits from buying the dips and then, presumably, selling when it gets higher than you would just hodling the whole lot?

460 now. It's going down!

Could be. I was thinking about whether it was worth doing short term trading with money I don't want to tie up long term - so many peaks/troughs are really obvious when you don't have anything you can put in them! But then, I'd probably make more money just investing and hodling it. I've not done well with day trading so far - trying to convince myself not to bother!

I'm in a similar position... I'd made a few bitcents trading back and forth between BTC and ETH, but in the last 24 hours, ETH has dropped about 20% relative to BTC, which basically wipes out all the gains I'd made. Still tempted to hodl though, especially as most of my money's still in BTC.

Or selling 10% of the way into a 50% drop and then buying at the bottom. I did that on the first part of the crash and made an extra 15% on it (ie, 15% more BTC than before). I ended up riding it most of the way down in January though because I wasn't convinced it would go much further. 
That takes more time and effort and risk though, so might not be worth it in the long run!

Personally, I just use a smaller ISP which gets me a faster connection and doesn't do the blocking (even Pirate Bay is unblocked). If this becomes law or the blocks do start to affect me, I shall be looking into VPNs though.
