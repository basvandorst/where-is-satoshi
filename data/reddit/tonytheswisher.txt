I'd pay to hear Trump try to explain Bitcoin and Cryptocurrency verbally, if a journalist reads this please ask him.

I was given a lot of latitude in digital marketing decisions, it was Microsoft that wanted to do the soft launch and it really was their call to make.

Ver was one of the first investors in BitPay so he was around for a while. He also was an early investor in Augur, a project I was a founding team member on right after I left BitPay. Ver was a good dude, haven't talked to him in years....he seems polarizing as hell now.
It's funny because I left the space for three years and got way back into it, now I'm not nearly as keen on other projects as I was...but Bitcoin is still the real deal!

I worked on the project when Microsoft started accepting Bitcoin when I was with BitPay back in 2014 and thought this would be a fun story to share here.
We worked on the project for months and had to go through a ton of testing and other things as Microsoft is obviously a big corporation and they were eager to get on the Bitcoin boat ASAP for competitive reasons. They also massively underestimated the enthusiasm of the Bitcoin community, specifically We warned them that a soft/quiet launch wouldn't be a good idea as someone would realize they would have this option and post it here very quickly, they disagreed and thought no one would care (this is a story we could share with a ton of merchants back in that era). We wanted the relationship to be great so we honored their wishes and they did a soft launch about 48 hours before the big announcement that would go on their social feeds and their blog. 
Needless to say about two hours after they started accepting Bitcoin, a thread was posted here showing it and the cat was out of the bag. They were shocked that many people would care and apologized to us.
The funny thing is the same story happened with 50 Cent and his people, The Sacramento Kings and Warner Bros. Records to a minor extent. None of them had any idea it would be as big of a deal as it was, even after we warned them multiple times. It was really a great time to be in this space and every week brought some exciting news and a new group of people getting exposed to Bitcoin.

OP was alerting the community to a possible scam and this is what you replied? 
Scam/phishing alerts should NEVER be off topic!

I got it too and I’m fairly certain it’s a phishing scam. Everyone be aware this is going on and thanks for posting this!
