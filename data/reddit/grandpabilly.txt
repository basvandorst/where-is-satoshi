Should've used Bitcoin where no fraud happens. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:14:32
Find another hobby. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 15:26:30
Bitcoin has grown a lot this year and the price only went down. So no, it isn't safe to assume that. 
Can you downvoters at least explain to me what part of my comment is wrong?
@_date: 2014-12-12 07:35:23
No!? Really?
@_date: 2014-12-12 09:23:19
No. They made a mistake. I'm not even gonna explain it to you. Put away your hate against banks for a minute and use some common sense. I don't like banks either but we still live in this place called reality. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 07:53:17
But it's about your freedom! Not about a drugs market owner who broke the law apparently. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 07:28:29
You really couldn't find out? It's mentioned in about 100 articles the last 24 hours. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:13:05
"I have no idea what i'm talking about, i just want free money". 
Sorry, can't help you. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 16:08:36
It's nutters like you who attract all these trolls. 
And no they aren't paid. They just like to make fun of certain people here. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:35:22
You're not gonna believe this, i know it sounds crazy, but nobody here knows where the price will go in the future. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 07:32:46
So what exactly do you expect? That we have crystal balls here that will tell us the future price? 
I understand that you are new to Bitcoin but this odd question gets asked daily here. How are we supposed to know if you should invest or not? The price might go up, it might go down. Just like any other investment out there. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 08:12:39
Great. The 100th thread where people will post random numbers between 0 and 1 million. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 20:10:12
You must be looking at a different chart. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 11:08:14
@_date: 2014-12-13 14:38:17
When it goes the wrong way then people here are suddenly very quick to point out this flaw. But when it predicts 10k by next year it's all good. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:31:22
@_date: 2014-12-13 09:37:52
No. You prove to us that it is. 
That's how it works. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 18:57:32
I'm not a Ross hater at all. 
I'm just getting tired of the "i love drugs and Bitcoin so Ross has to be innocent" nonsense. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 09:00:34
Thank god this one isn't. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:29:46
No, she doesn't. You just made that up. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 17:39:43
I wonder why one person is asking why Bitcoin can't just die already. I wonder how it affects his life in such a negative way that he wants it gone. 
The ignorance and hate from these people against something they don't even understand is unlike anything i've ever seen. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:16:44
Keep telling yourself that. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:18:02
As you can see OP, your thread isn't too popular here. Reality and facts never are. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:31:36
Not at all. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 00:13:17
Who told you you could make Bitcoins?
@_date: 2014-12-14 19:03:52
Yes. Exactly. Suddenly everyone is political correct as fuck when it's about their druggie messiah. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 07:46:16
About our freedom? How is my freedom affected exactly?
@_date: 2014-12-13 08:11:20
It gives you the shills??
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:30:44
Because Ross is their bitcoin and drugs messiah. That. The only reason. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 15:51:52
I seriously think he has mental problems and thinks his reasoning is flawless so he can't possibly have made any mistakes. He also doesn't seem to realize the impact of the situation. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 19:43:55
I hope you're not talking about the price because recently i keep reading that the price isn't important. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:14:20
Only 6 years. 
Edit: can one of you downvoters please explain to me why you are downvoting the comment?
@_date: 2014-12-14 16:59:53
Nice quality. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 12:07:52
Getting kinda sick of the word. I see it used almost daily here. And every day for something else. 
Just like "this is huge!".
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:37:54
Look man. Everybody is tired of answering this. There are at least 200 similar topics that would've answered your question. But you refused to use the search. 
Besides that your question was just silly. I have no money but i want to mine. What kind of answer do you expect then exactly?
And downvoting everyone won't help your case either. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 15:27:31
Sorry, i stopped reading after the first sentence. 
So no proof? I'm shocked. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 08:51:05
We had no idea!
@_date: 2014-12-11 19:47:56
A few different sources, sure. The same story posted every 5 mins for 49 hours? No. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:08:48
What drugs are you currently on? Please tell me you're not sober. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:04:04
A meme with a grammar mistake is just meh.  
@_date: 2014-12-14 18:36:04
You don't know this. Stop making up shit. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 00:33:50
No way!
@_date: 2014-12-14 18:42:49
Doesn't matter. He will reject it anyway. Even when found guilty. He will then call it a conspiracy or something. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 18:59:38
How many more times and days are you gonna post this? Don't you think 100 times or so has been enough for everyone already?
@_date: 2014-12-14 15:18:46
Absolutely horrible indeed. Now i'm just waiting for proof that all this is actually used by whatever company. I'm sure you have that proof and will post it soon to educate us. 
@_date: 2014-12-13 10:04:10
That's also not how things work. 
You have an arrogance problem. 
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:42:02
Those comments are crazy. Totally crazy. Even now ms accepts Bitcoin people just keep screaming scam without having a clue how it works. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:37:10
Why should i have doubts? 
I don't know if he did it but so far everything points to he did. With quite some evidence. 
It's unreasonable to doubt it just because he seemed like a nice guy. The excuse i see here all the time. And which you are probably using as well. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 17:53:00
@_date: 2014-12-13 09:37:00
No. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:28:10
@_date: 2014-12-13 14:39:53
It would also be extremely bad for Bitcoin if it dropped that low. Maybe that's more important than you being able to buy a few coins 50% off. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 17:54:59
He may read this? 
This is based on what exactly?
@_date: 2014-12-12 01:15:51
Well to be honest that's not how providing proof works. 
You can't make a claim without proof and then ask others to proof you wrong. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 12:29:15
He's being charged with hiring a hitman in Maryland. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 18:43:43
That is not far fetched at all. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 18:44:29
The bs from you Ross fanboys just goes on and on...
@_date: 2014-12-12 07:58:49
This bone has been gnawed on in 10 previous topics alreadyb 
@_date: 2014-12-11 15:01:36
There is absolutely no evidence that Facebook and Amazon will follow soon. 
This place would be so much more readable without this constant circle jerk nonsense. 
@_date: 2014-12-12 08:53:31
"Should have". 
And no. It wasn't his money. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 15:13:03
Paid off? Why who exactly?
@_date: 2014-12-13 15:12:32
How do you know it never will happen?
@_date: 2014-12-11 23:31:23
Stop with this bullshit man. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 18:46:40
Yeah poor guy. Tried to get 6 people killed and is now punished for it. It's just not fair!
@_date: 2014-12-14 19:35:23
Yet most of his fanboys act this way. 
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:09:32
Reality hurts, doesn't it?
@_date: 2014-12-12 22:31:07
So after 2 years you still think people can predict the price and know where Bitcoin will go in the near future??
@_date: 2014-12-14 20:33:24
I shouldn't even have clicked that bs but couldn't resist. 
I stopped reading after the first sentence though. It started even worse than i imagined. 
"This why:
– It was too much effort, a waist of time and energy, just to build it to be only religious center."
Some people shouldn't have internet access.
