It's going to kill liquidity for actual BTC

lol alright man. In the industry we always laugh at guys like you who read a couple Michael Lewis books and think that makes them an expert. Keep doing your thing.

I understand how a short sale works. That's why I understand that these institutions probably already loaded up on BTC, then they're going to take out a bunch of short positions and sell the BTC from the lender at top dollar, then sell out their currently owned positions at the top of the market as well and use that combined with other market manipulation to drive down the price and close out their short. This double dipping on profit and hugely so. Like I said, happens very frequently.

On the short selling point I should've been more clear. Yes you buy something to close out a short position, but before doing that you would try to manipulate the market and crash the stock price. This is not infrequent when large institutions have taken short positions and the price is going up too much for their comfort. You crash the stock via different ways of manipulation (sometimes this might even entail selling off any non-short positions that your institution holds) and then close out your short position and give the now much cheaper stock to the original lender. Typically, this causes sell offs as other institutions and retail investors either see the price dropping fast and panic sell or the price hits their stop loss order causing them to sell, driving the price down, and hitting even more stop loss orders until the panic subsides and the price levels out.
As for the rest of your comments, you are not entirely correct, but what do I know I'm just a lawyer for a Wall Street institution. You probably know the law and what goes on at an asset manager better than I do.

This response legit has me cracking up

Pretty sure I confirmed that I do know that in an earlier comment and explained how having short positions can cause a large institution to have a desire to manipulate the market and cause a sell off prior to buying back and closing out the short. Sorry that my original comment was unclear, didn't mean to give you an aneurysm

^ this. I would change that to "most likely will be a negative side to this"

This is going to be very bad for BTC liquidity and price since there's no need to actually buy the BTC when doing a futures contract. Wall Street is going to short the shit out of BTC. They did the same thing with gold and silver back in the day.

Yeah lol, what is that guy talking about? The futures haven't launched yet. Clearly knows nothing about the CME or much about futures at all. The guy further up the chain is exactly right. This hurts BTC liquidity because you can just buy a cash contract instead of an actual bitcoin

Lol that dude is fucked. Sold within a year? That's a short term capital gains tax so it will be taxed at his ordinary income rate.

I think you have a general understanding of shorting, but I don't think you fully realize how hedge funds and major wall street institutions can essentially move the market however they want. Shorting for institutions like that is not as risky as you would think. They can pretty easily shift the price however they want it.
The world of biotech stocks are a good example. A bunch of institutions take out a ton of shorts, but the price is going up too much so they get antsy. They start selling out of their own positions in the stock, which causes a sell off, helped in part by triggering other investors stop loss orders which cause them to sell. This happens all the time. I'm not saying it will be the death of BTC by any means, but you are drastically underestimating the ability of financial institutions to move the market in the way that they want. They also have much more of an interest in lowering the price than they do in betting that it is going to increase. Look what they did to gold and silver.
