Cryptorush. Hes a fat scamming fuck hiding in peru.

Yes, because people cannot withdraw BTC. So they want rid of it and into things like doge, which may offer them a way out of cryptsy. Check out the doge price. Higher than everywhere else.

Withdrawn 90% of coins. Thank you.

Because at the moment which exchange can we really trust? 
Bitfinex is supposedly solid, their backend and staff are at least. Shame I cant say that about their platform as its riddled with bugs and they still havent integrated AlphaMidas engine.
Okc have a shoddy and shady company but an excellent back end and trading platform (so far). 
So in that respect id rather leave what im willing to risk in return of a good trading platform. 
@_date: 2015-05-30 21:56:11
Traders need liquidity, itBit has none afaik and coinbase will never get my details. I'm already ashamed of placing my details into the hands of Okcoin. 
I also use 20x for my trades and at the moment Okcoin is the only decent solution.

Are you guys a **PROFESSIONAL** company or some fucking monkeys? 
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:57:09
I'd like to trade where I'm used to and I won't be butthurt if they do pull a gox.

Nope, I've encountered 1 margin call on a short position (which I didn't feel comfortable in anyway) which happened whilst I was asleep due to the Microsoft Pump back in Nov/Dec I think it was. Other than that I've been on the platform close to a year with nothing as such happening to me. Bear in mind I do not have the capital etc which I think OKCoin would see and think "hmm, we could use that money". Maybe if I had hundreds of BTC on there taking stupid positions something might happen to me.

Again I would never put my details on his site.

These issues are not new. Finex has been crapping up for months.
Phil sounded pretty tipsy when he was on TS on the night of the dump too. Many called him out on it. *stokes fire*

This totally this... its CS. Not school kiddy cod.
6 teams, 5 players a team. Each play each other. Best of 1 matchmaking. Players must specify their rank and will be slotted to a team which makes it fair across the board.

This way EVERYONE has a copy of the legitimate chain. If they all had different snippets and copies how can we sure someone hasnt forged some coins or added transactions? Its for validity.

What they have in mind is fascinating.
Bitcoin is not to be used by humans. Its a token for machines and devices to communicate alongside sharing data instantly across a decentralised and trusted network.
'Just provides continuous liquidity into the system' - if your device has a means to load up Bitcoin, or connect to the network and generate some, it is officially online and connected. It can use this coin to reach out to other devices on the network or vice versa, 'tipping' them for their service. The higher the payment, the higher up the queue you go. Devices become asynchronous machines working together on prioritised tasks, one whole truly efficient mesh network. 
They have received the most funding for a reason, do not doubt their genius, they know the power of Bitcoin more than anyone and I'm certain they know how to use it.
