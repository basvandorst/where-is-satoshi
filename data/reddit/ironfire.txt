China have legalised and banned crypto more times than I can count.  Chinese have been trading bitcoin and mining bitcoin on a large scale since the early days. IMO their banning/legalising statements are about influencing the price/difficulty.

Prediction: bitcoin continues to trade sideways for the next few days, then starts a January rally. Traders knew they would be away from their desks over xmas so divested. Once they are back at work they'll want to buy back in and then it will snowball from there. Add that to the new crypto trading desks and new futures derivatives, there are a lot of people who need to buy enough bitcoin to manage a reserve.

last time it went crazy up, but who knows
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:39:22
The same thing happened with the $1200 spike, but if the ppl who bought in on that hype HODL then they are laughing now. Same thing on the $200 spike before that, and the $30 spike before that, and the $1 spike before that. Over the long term bitcoin still has a long way to go up.

1) Faster javascript to show updating buy/sell orders in the trading tab. Sometimes it can take a second or two to refresh.
2) Faster servers that are happy processing larger volumes of trades. The site slows down whenever any serious action happens.
3) Forget about adding any fancy new features, just make what they already have run smoothly.

I'd stopped setting up miners with an aim to be profitable, but now I'm thinking about setting up a bunch more just because BIP 16/17 has made clear that we need more independent mining operations that are not using pools.
I think on most votes, I will simply vote against, as I think it is healthy to have this resistance to change to the code.
Also, I'm thinking we need an alternative to bitcoin.org that provides all versions of the client for download, including a simple, easy option that is as close to the original client as possible.

Hmmm, so I'm expecting it to return to the moving average, but it would be nice if it dipped down once more before it did so.
(edit: I predict it moves up to 6.25 by the end of the weekend, to make my statement falsifiable :-)
@_date: 2012-08-16 00:39:26
If you look on mtgoxlive, there are several flat lines that the price line bumps up against. Those are walls going down. Seems like there is a lot of upward pressure. At some point, word will get out about this and when that happens lots of people will probably clammer to get a piece of the action, so I expect to see something similar to what happened last summer.
(Additionally I suspect the spike that just happened will provoke optimistic subscriber alerts by bitcoinbullbear and the like, which will cause their subscribers to add to the already existing buying pressure)

Well, yes, I have been shorting today, as the price was going down so it made sense to do so. I do think $1.50 is unlikely, but I also thought it wouldn't break the $12 level and it is getting dangerously close to that ($12.1 at time of writing).
The bit that worried me from S3052's post is "If 14 $ – 14.2 $ zone falls, we may quickly see declines to 10 $. And if this falls, a free fall.".

There is currently a 10,000 bitcoin trade wall at $8.50, and this isn't unusual.

"The terms shorting and going short are also used as blanket terms for tactics that allow an investor to gain from the decline in price of a security."
@_date: 2011-07-05 18:55:43
Between here and $10 there aren't many open buy orders either. Big wall at $10 though, so hopefully that will stop it.
@_date: 2011-07-05 19:39:52
Sell some bitcoins then buy back later. If the price went down, you have more btc than before. If it went up, you have less.
edit: But remember to factor in fees charged by the exchange. The price needs to move more than you've paid in fees.

I'm watching for it to break $7, the last decent high. If it goes past $7, I'm going all in.

While I think bitcoin will trade in this way once it has matured, I think it is currently trading more like a tech startup stock. It's seen as a speculative play and not a safe haven. I agree that it will trade this way eventually though.

The cost of electricity used when mining bitcoins is going to become less of an issue. With GPUs it was a huge concern, but with low-power ASICs, it is rapidly becoming a negligible cost. So I think most miners will keep their rigs running regardless.

@_date: 2013-03-25 13:48:35
Huh? Do you mean 0.0005 per block? It is completely possible to make a transaction without adding any transaction fee.
Miners are still making healthy amounts from new coins, without requiring transaction fees on top. So for now, set it to nothing, or one satoshi.
@_date: 2013-03-25 14:04:33
Nope, it's the opposite. It costs more $ to buy the mining equipment to produce the same amount of BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-04 15:51:08
If litecoin succeeds, then the price would rise and this argument will no longer apply.
Bitcoin's decimal place will get moved at some point, making the numbers easier to manage for everyday transactions.
Bitcoin doesn't weigh anything, so there isn't a clear need for a gold/silver/copper situation. It is just as convenient to carry ten thousand bitcoins as it is to carry 0.0001 bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:30:40
Is this a scam or real?
@_date: 2013-03-04 14:02:16
We could probably safely move one decimal place right now. $3.4 for a bitcoin, not bad. :-)

A mesh network incentivised using bitcoin. If you serve up some content for someone (whether because you have a wired internet connection, because you're passing the content along a chain of meshnet nodes, or because you've cached the content and are serving up from there) then you get paid a tiny amount of bitcoins by the person requesting the content.
Incentivising this way, would encourage people to set up more nodes, and upgrade their nodes to be able to handle more traffic and over a wider area. The meshnet would grow in a similar way to the bitcoin mining network.
@_date: 2013-09-04 00:07:23
I think the problem is that people do calculations either using current difficulty, or some graduated decline of it. If you are getting your ASIC delivery, so are a lot of other people, and you're probably not right at the front of the queue.

If one person has a bitcoin they want to sell, but there are two people who want to buy this bitcoin, this is what it means that demand is greater than supply. Only one bitcoin will change hands, but because there was greater competition on the demand side, the price would be higher, all things being equal.
@_date: 2013-08-27 15:10:40
I'll believe it when I see it.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:28:07
True. Same is true of saying '1 bitcoin is worth $1000'. All arbitrary measurements.

Every $1 spent on bitcoins at the beginning of 2011, would be worth more than if you had spent it on GPU rigs and had them mining 24/7/365.
GPU mining was profitable, but not more profitable than buying and holding bitcoins.

So you would like the default value on installation to be lower? Mining pools don't have any control over this, other than to refuse to mine those blocks, but market forces will take care of this problem.
The core developers do have some control over this, but bitcoin is open source, so all you need to do is fork the code and set a new default value. Then compile, make available on a website and anyone who wants to can then download and use it. Looks like someone is attempting something along these lines here: 
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:41:06
Have some upvotes. Your original post looked a lot like spam, so that's probably why you didn't get them before. Also your website doesn't look very good, so hard to trust that it isn't just something a scammer knocked up. Plenty of web designers who work for bitcoin - hire one if you get some sales. :-)
@_date: 2013-06-26 15:48:28
If they ripped off one of the ASIC designs and sold that (delivering say, within a month of order), they would find that the size of the market would increase dramatically. Might still be a few thousand people buying, but how many they'd buy is the question.
@_date: 2013-03-07 16:03:28
There you go again, 'evil' and 'should'. These words have no place when engaging with a market. Nobody is 'fucking with' anybody. These are all consensual trades between people who have different opinions on whether the price is too high or too low.
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:17:50
It took several months for the price to fall down to $2 after the spike to $30 a couple of years ago. If history repeats itself, the price has a way to drop yet, but it will take its time doing so.
@_date: 2013-05-03 12:07:30
Long term I'm also bullish. But by selling when it is relatively high (such as now IMHO) and buying when it is relatively low (at some point over the next few months, again IMHO), you have more bitcoins.
