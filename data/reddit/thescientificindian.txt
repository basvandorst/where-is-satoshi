So which bank do you work at?

Fuck. You're motivating me to burn through more money. I'm jumping back in. Thanks OP!

Sending money Instantly? Even that has lost its meaning.

This actually proves why this entire crypto world is in a bubble. This is exactly how it all went down with the DOT com bubble. Every Investor threw their money into any company making even an announcement of establishing an Internet company, they didn't even bother to see if the tech was good. Just claim you're a startup in silicon valley and here all the founders suddenly turn into millionaires.  Read the article folks before downvoting this comment. Accept it. It'll burst. But it is the future, so it'll rise and become stable as how every Internet company in the world is now.

Seems like the case. How exactly can they patent an open source technology?

I agree. Speculative markets like these make it much interesting to always second guess and predictions.
