I agree the video exaggerates a little, but neither do I think any of your solutions are 'long-term'.
Seeking aid from other countries or the IMF may stabilise the Lira temporarily, but it would also shows that the Turkish government itself has acknowledged that their economy is in trouble. Furthermore the aid has to be huge to recover from their current predicament.
A statement by the government would also help, a bit, but atm they are asking for the Turkish people to prop the lira up themselves. Unsuprisingly, Erdogan is managing this horrendously. 
The Lira was already in freefall before the the US tariffs, so a reversal wouldnt help.
I believe that the Lira will depreciate further, maybe to 13 TRY to 1 GBP. No way do I see it recovering to 4 or 5 in the short-run. I have family in Turkey, and helped them to buy substantual Bitcoin, Euro and GBP last year. Now we are looking for opportunites to buy cheap property in Turkey

Im with OP on this one. Up to 7500 we had steady growth but from that point on it seems like people are pilling on simply through fomo. I never believed bitcoin was a bubble, and still dont, but am a little concerned
