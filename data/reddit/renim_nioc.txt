There's not much difference between a paper wallet and paper copy of seed when storing.. It's when spending that hardware wallets are superior.
With a hardware wallet the keys never leave the hardware, so you can plug it into a virus-ridden PC and your keys are safe.
However if you load your paper wallet into a compromised PC you can lose your coins before you get the chance to spend them.

Does it reject the seed as invalid? Or does it work but present you with empty accounts?
If the latter, maybe you used passphrases before - go into advanced settings and enable passphrase encryption.  
Then "forget" your TREZOR device and reconnect it (and hope you remember the passphrase)

You can't import a wallet file into a TREZOR or other hardware wallet.  
However if your wallet file was generated from a BIP-39 compatible 12 or 24 word seed, you can import (restore) that.

Yes the address you're sending from will be empty, but you will have a new address in your wallet that holds your change.
edit: some wallets will send the change back to the same address it came from

sure, you can keep receiving funds on that address.
Just bear in mind that anyone that knows that it's your address also knows how many bitcoins you're transferring in and out, which is why you're generally advised to use a new address every time.

BCH has replay protection.  Upcoming forks don't.
Move your BTC to another paper wallet first, then import your private keys from the old wallet into something like Electron Cash.

Yes, if you have the "use change addresses" option selected (under preferences -&gt; Transactions)
And it'll either keep using the same "change" address, or if you tick the "use multiple change addresses" it'll create a new one every time.

A paper wallet and a hardware wallet (with paper backup seed) are identical, until you go to send your coins out.
You will need to load the private key from your paper wallet into a (potentially insecure) software wallet to send coins, whereas with a hardware wallet the private key remains safe.
You can also add a passphrase to a hardware wallet which means even with the seed (or "hacked" device) your coins remains safe.

In OP's case the wallet is irrelevant.  If you didn't hold BTC at the exact time of the fork you didn't have any BCH either...

Why would it be obsolete?  TREZOR supports segwit, and has done since only a few days after activation.

If you look at you will see that many people are reporting issues receiving funds into CoinBase today.
Your address is different because CoinBase (like most wallets) generates a new receive address every time - that way people that send you money can't see what other money you've received/will receive in future.

The main problem is that if someone accepts USD (via credit card etc) and sends bitcoin, the USD transaction can be reversed by the sender (chargeback etc) but the bitcoin transaction can't.   Nobody wants to take that risk!

Gee I wonder why...
@_date: 2017-09-05 07:24:49
If mining isn't profitable, fewer people will mine.  
When fewer people mine the difficulty goes down, meaning more coins are rewarded, making it profitable again.
It's self-balancing.

This is a question that gets asked all the time, so not surprisingly it's in the FAQ:

It's a pity there's so much fear around replay protection.
Lack of replay protection doesn't suddenly mean people can steal your coins (provided you hold the private keys) especially if you've got them in cold storage.
Lack of replay protection doesn't mean the cryptography securing bitcoin is suddenly broken.
It simply means that if the Bitcoin blockchain is split in two, transactions on one subchain are equally valid on the other subchain.
Your private keys are still required to create transactions on either chain, so if you don't create them they can't be copied (replayed)
If you don't care about the new chain then just ignore it.  
It's only if you try to extract value from both chains (like with the BTC/BCH split) that you need to take care.
Again if you're HODLing long term, just ignore any and all hardforks for now, only when you're ready to move those coins do you need to decide if you want to try and claim both sides.
By then I suspect there will be plenty of guides on how to do it.

The keys are generated from the 24 word seed, with a standard algorithm (BIP38) that many other wallets support.
In other words, you need to make sure you keep the 24 words in a secure location because if you lose them/someone else gets access to them, you lose your coins.
In that sense it's no different from a paper wallet.
What makes TREZOR and other hardware wallets different from paper wallets, is you can use them to sign transactions (send coins) without ever exposing your keys to a potentially vulnerable computer, but with a paper wallet you need to scan the private key into a computer (or phone) every time you want to send coins.


Consider that if someone manages to install malware (virus, trojan etc) onto your computer they can gain access to your keys.   Even if you encrypt your wallet they simply need to run a keylogger and wait for you to unlock it.   
With a hardware wallet the keys never leave the device, so you can plug it into an untrustworthy computer and still know your keys are safe.

To be fair, although Tim Berners-Lee created the first web browser - as well as the underlying language (HTML) I believe this is more comparable to Satoshi's work - inventing the blockchain as we know it, as well as the first software that talks to it.
It was [Mosaic]( and later [Netscape]( that first catapulted the WWW into public view.
Both were co-authored by [Marc Andreessen]( a big proponent of Bitcoin.

There's no BTG infrastructure yet - no nodes, no "mainnet" network, not even a testnet
That means there's no way to transfer BTG to or from anywhere (including exchanges)
All they've done is taken a snapshot of the Bitcoin blockchain and are madly trying to finish the rest of the coding required so they can actually launch (and in the meantime pre-mine themselves a bunch of coins)
@_date: 2017-09-28 08:16:07
Because it's only relevant if you care about both chains!
As I said [elsewhere]( lack of replay protection doesn't mean Bitcoin's cryptography is broken.  It simply means if you make a transaction someone can replay it on the other chain.


Au contraire.  If you choose to only use one coin and ignore the other, replays won't affect you.
