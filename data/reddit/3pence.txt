If you can distribute the app to parents they can buy tokens (which are bitcoins) at the door, receive them on their wallet and pay for the goods that way.  Community members will be glad to know there is a student base with knowledge of the mechanics of electronic payment systems so you create awareness to outside philanthropy that way.

Its a free market, out of altrusim the network has to make the best option available and maintained.  All the major cryptocurrrencies go through periods of pools going over the 50% mark and everytime people boo hoo (competitors probably) but answer always has and will be P2Pool.  Whats going to happen the minute and hour after a pool pulls &gt; 50% and whether by choice or by folly there is a alternative chain fork ... watch the market sell sell sell!  
So Mr. A. Antonopolous and fans, there is an incentive for a pool or operator at a pool to try a 51% attack.... a 51% attack is a viable option for price manipulation to buy cheap coins.  The Bitcoin the network is a unregulated system or sorts and this is all free game so long as operators like the numerous exchanges and hardware venders that the defacto "professional" bitcoin talking heads defend or look the other way when the commercial bitcoin operators are allowed continue questionable practices that go against the core values of bitcoin itself.  Mr. Antonopoulous knows that network security is a practice and not just a box checked off on the list as a goal met and to allow pool operators to acheive &gt; 50% is pure laziness by bitcoin the community.  There are no bailouts or legal recourse for the bitcoin network the day and months after a pool operator does create a fork.

The report does not indicate in any way that a 51% attack would be unlikely or without consequence.
Whether by choice or by folly a blockchain fork linked to a 51% event would send the price down.  There is no recourse except social media if it does happen...
Conclusion:  There is an economic incentive for pool operators to create an environment for cheap coins and pr reputation bolstering opportunities for bitcoin community social media boffins to calm the community with their logical well reasoned comfort talks in times of crisis like that a 51% forking event would cause.

The phishing attack that has target coinbase (bitcoin holders) customers is one where a link is sent to you and asks you to sign in to google or yahoo even though you are already signed in.  That is the big warning.... the problem then becomes the link html expires without a trace within minutes of it being accessed so there is no proof of the page that captured  your username &amp; password.
Go through your emails for the past month, any email that link has expired should be suspect.  And stay suspicious of any emails even if you have met the sender especially if it was through a bitcoin meetup or conference.  These type of assholes are a dime a dozen and they use basic trust or confidence as a gateway to pull off a sneak, seek and steal attack.

Do not think because you know the person that the email cannot be the one phishing link. 
Send the email and information to coinbase security.

So if you are just increment a salt on the random seed you will have a HD wallet of addresses. And if you have two random seeds and increment the salt on the random seeds you would have a have in effect the basis for a HD multisig wallet.  Is that correct?
@_date: 2014-10-30 18:06:28
1) Colored coins can be provide an atomic unit for transactions
2) At scale it would be tough to track every address to an identity.  You do not have to have users register there identity with vote wallet just to qualify to receive vote tokens
3) Traditionally random vote tokens are as secure from vote stealing/buying as voting is in most family households.

China first said nothing, and the market gods felt great.
China then delivered an advisory and there was panic but eventually relief and things went back to "normal" euphoria.
Then China made another explicit advisory with a deadline for immediate compliance and the market gods sank and there was no good news as China had destroyed liquidity options within the countries border...  The official policy of china is bitcoin is not a valid commodity to exchange RMB for within its borders via authorized financial institutions.
The best news possible out of china would be that the cryptocoin communities are innovating uses for cryptocoins and not implementing another exchange.  With out real world use bitcoin will bomb like dogecoin because it is just a hyped up token to trade.
If Chinese started online markets that only use cryptocoins, that would be reason to get excited.  Another form of cash to coin exchange is not in and of itself a sign of anything except someone betting there will be tolerance towards small cash transactions.

Bitcoin supporters need to rule out what is not the a driver of the price.
If it is the amount of miners in the system selling off unhedged positions in mining power this could be deleterious to Bitcoin.  It would be even more of a problem if no protocol changes were made to accommodate something like this out of hubris about the perfection of Bitcoin.
Just saying it might be time to step back and put some serious work into evaluating the economic incentives for Bitcoin participants now that we have 3 years of robust data.

Your assumption is it is mining inflation alone, you are not considering the cost of mining hardware for new miners to appreciably cover the costs of mining.  If miners cannot cover the costs they will sell at any price to avoid a total loss.
In the long run a equilibrium will be found but we are not there yet and as long as Bitcoin is primarily used as a trading instrument and asset to mine it is going to be a very bumpy ride up and down.  
We need to underhype bitcoin to achieve stability and then let the mercantile commerce system take over as the price driver.  This is not to say Bitcoin's intrinsic value is faulty, just that speculation cannot not be the driving force in price... actual utility in the use of Bitcoin needs to be better appreciated in real non currency to currency exchange.  i.e. goods and services.

Build a bake sale or lemonade stand app that accepts bitcoins that the school intranet can access.  Have the class learn to code basic html and js and contribute to a class project via git.  
Then I would consider funding so you can buy supplies for the sale and use testnet so parents or staff do not have to aquire bitcoin.  Thats business, coding, bitcoin all into one.  Bitcoin does not need more miners it needs people using bitcoin for commerce.

If the price is booming some people will use these but outside of that these types of exchanges do not get a lot of market traction.   
The centralized real time markets do well because they offer immediate neuro feedback of gains and losses and that in itself is like a drug to many.

One solution is not put misplaced trust in the "Bitcoin Foundation", but instead support a "Blockchain Foundation" that promotes best practices, provides design and regulatory advice for application specific blockchains.
Bitcoin is a great blockchain for the purpose it was initiated for but not yet a great currency for users at large. 
However, blockchains are finding niche uses in many places so too many in the blockchain user and development community are finding "Bitcoin" too narrowly defined in comparison to the general expectations of "smart" blockchain enabled p2p network applications.  The biggest problem is people's expectations and realizable vision are out of scope of the core purpose of "Bitcoin" the peer to peer payment blockchain.
"Bitcoin" is working within a too narrowly set of defacto rules to make itself useable for peer to peer payments in the form of digital gold at this time unless of course, the devs believe scaling is a more important issue than market volatilities.  Bitcoin was not ready for mainstream adoption at the time of the Foundations formation.  Bitcoin was fit for lobbying just not broad scale commercialization for consumer use and this is where the Foundation got stuck.

I respect Jimmy's work a lot and ironically almost asked Paul to put me in contact with him at the very time they were going back and forth on reddit during the last article unbeknownst to me. 
It appears he is only going off of publicity and marketing information to get the details of Factom, which was my mistake when I first assessed Factom.  According to the devs, the marketing team has asked the technical crew not to speak about the technical features.
The more I talk to the development team the more impressed I am with the planned deliverables.  As far as I can tell, Factom is a hybrid system with the scalability improvements proposed for Bitcoin. There are more capabilities planned beyond hashing stamps into blockchains.
I think the marketing strategy is "underpromise and at least deliver on that".

With web rtc you can create a federated in browser client-server trade network using atomic cross chain protocols.   you need signaling servers (which can be federated) to make the connection, but after getting connected to another browser you can confirm that the counter party funds are ready and perform the trade.  In case multiple parties are interested you can use the micropayment coineffine style protocol to perform the transaction (in case there are multiple buyers on one offer to protect all parties)
I really think this is the way forward for simple trades, however feedback from business heads want centralization to protect a market stake.  From a UX perspective, I think it can fit into the three step rule very well lowering the cognitive dissonance for users and email like trades.

1. Earn Bitcoin, do something that people will pay you for in bitcoins.
2. Not worth investing in bitcoins.  Invest in understanding Bitcoin the protocol and the themes and variations that are being built and used in the ecosystem.  i.e. Ethereum, Counterypartyd, Colored Coins.  
3. No.  Its not worth trading bitcoins.  The currency will only settle (validate itself) if many many people use Bitcoin the currency as a transfer mechanism regarding ownership. Speculator activity has no intrinsic value and is deleterious to the ecosystem unless the exchanged resource is finite and in demand from an end user for value added production.  Without demand from an end users who engage primarily in non speculative activities (not more trading),  its just gambling.

1. Bitcoin devs are invested in Bitcoin as the open standard protocol for programmable transfer of value.  They would rather have a solid unfancy implementation of value transfer than entertain changes to the way the main protocol works.  As far as the protocol goes they are more open to removing a feature that can cause a problem then add a new feature that could have a cascade of consequences into unkown territories.   They are staking their professional lives on Bitcoin and carry the attitudes to maintain this preventative approach.
2.  People with novel ideas for and outside of Bitcoin are welcome to join to show and discuss at length their own ideas with others.

To my understanding decentralized automated contracts is a main objective for mastercoin.  I believe your concerns hold strong for colored coin as conceived at their debut.  Regardless, if enough people like the idea of the new transaction possibilities they will enforce it by adopting the use of enough node clients to carryout the new protocols.  Perhaps the new protocols will be bound by transparency on the block chain; but with crypto libraries like Open Transactions being vetted and integrated into the eco system I think you will be surprised on what the new transaction libraries can achieve in terms of automated enforcement  by the network and/or federation of participating nodes.

Innovative and interesting in comparison to bitcoin, Freicoin is at least attempting to create a digital currency not like bitcoin in its economic design.  Interesting that they are designing a currency that is boring in comparison to huge bursts in valuation....

http is a well defined protocol that uses the tcp protocol.  http uses primitives of tcp to implement and transact the http protocol.  Mastercoin uses the bitcoin blockchain to carry out its own protocol.  The mastercoin author is explicit that mastercoin is just a protcol layer for other things to be built on.  Satoshi more than implied that bitcoin was just a protocol to be built on.  I see no conflict in interest or intentions; just peoples understanding of the endgame for the current crypto currency technologies.   Satsohi wrote the bitcoin scripting protocol too but it never passed all tests and no one has taken the time to vett it to a fully functional working order.  **I see mastercoin as a safe alternative to the bitcoin scripting layer** which has known serious flaws.

The Nakamoto bitcoin protocol has a lot of "hidden features" still.  Look up Mike Hearn talks to find out more about them or get on IRC and ask around.  Its not so much that they are hidden as they are undeveloped and need a maintainer or someone to develop capabilities into features.  You will be learning many layers deeper into the current breed of cryptocurrencies then an altcoin (testnet) coin will teach you; even if it is just clarifying or updating wikipages.

bitcoin has left the currency realm and has moved into the commodity realm.  Buying bitcoin is an investment in the system as a p2p payment system.  A bitcoin can still be broken down into a million units per coin.  It is possible that people will just transact in satoshis some day.  In a sense buying bitcoin is like buying speculative shares in a p2p payment system of the future..

Its mutually assured devaluation of the Govt coffers for both sides.
Devalue the dollar, devalue return on debt that the chinese bought in hopes of at least breaking even on, chances are they bought the debt to spur their own economy, but if there are no suitable buyers for their mega manufacturing complex then they too sink further into economic uncertainty,  their housing bubble will most likely implode returning their new middle class and politicos into the ranks of the poor.... its a pernicious anemic economic cycle devaluing the dollar could create.
At this point a collapsing bubble with chinese characteristics is a cyclone followed by a tsunami relative to other economies in the number of people it affects.

10 minutes and 6 confirmations was a arbitrary buffer to protect people from making transactions hastily.  You can choose to allow zero or 100 confirmations if you wish.  Nothing is stopping that but your own judgement.  The block time of 10 minutes might be necessary to buffer new mining technology that comes online.  Most of the smaller altcoins with minute block times run into volatile difficulty issues with the target block times when asics jump on and off their block chain.

The official ruby api is fairly easy to use
Could be a good project to learn some basic programming.
   Writing data into csv is something you can learn easily very early on.
   Once you get that down you can have Office Libre update the worksheet automatically once you start the script.  If you really want to look further into it learn to demonize the ruby process or an easy but effective route is to add the script to your chron jobs and update in the background automatically if your computer is on.

Alice tells Bob of the escrow service.
Both Alice and Bob have to send their Public Keys to the escrow sevice.
Alice &amp; Bob send their verified correct qr to the escrow for processing of the transaction because sending long strings of text is old school and its going to be 2014.

+1 
I cannot agree more.
Everyone wants a distributed exchange (stock / currency market).
What we all really want is for bitcoin to proliferate as a currency not an asset class.
At least a payment asset class that we can use for anything from chewing gum to buying a house.
For this to happen bitcoin type payments need to proliferate in use amongst people who exchange it for goods and services not gains in market value.  That is the bottle neck many do not want to face head on in practice; if bitcoin was worth a buck but could be used any where that would be just as valuable to the endgame of a viable currency as any $1300 fair value call.

In my opinion it is a matter of conflation in concepts, nothing more.  Mastercoin does not set out to peg the value of its derivatives to the value of bitcoin only the technology.  Yes, the mastercoin folks talk about the potential high value of mastercoin but they say that because it makes blockchain transactions programmable and births a more fluid crytocurrency scheme with potential for exponentially more diverse types of transactions.  The potential for a exponentially greater variety in transaction types is what gets all the mastercoin and colored coin people so big eyed.  They both are doing this in a very open and no tricks up my sleeve manner.   One might rise and one might fall or both will serve niche purposes.  When the mastercoin folks talk about the extreme value potential of their protocol it is just to get heads attention and talking.  As it stands in my opinion mastercoin is the **safe alternative to the faulty bitcoin script mechanism**.... same with colored coin.

Buy Bitcoins then Freicoin at cryptsy or bter.com
Freicoin deserves a better reputation in the crypto currency community for it is one of the few altcoins that is in fact innovative in its design and is reasonably thought out economic design.  The core devs have even talked about the idea of pegging the freicoin value to a basket of non perishable commodities to reduce volatility.  At this time if deflationary volatility hampers bitcoin users faith in the bitcoin network and its ability to be a p2p payment system, Freicoin will be first in line with a well thought out solution and network ready for new users.  But as you can see from btchombre response (which I agree with in half) we are deep into the bitcoin hype cycle so Freicoin poses no immediate value except for developers to try out a different economic design in a crypto currency.

actually you are being targets with ads specific to bitcoin because you have been searching for it.  BFL seems to be the highest bidder for bitcoin advertising at the moment.
BFL is a company most would love to support but like you have noticed the information they provide is in no way inspiring.  If they default on producing asics in the next week I would not doubt if there is a severe market correction...  and bitcoin will be the lauging stock for the rest of the year and many history books to come in fraud.  How they will respond is unknown.  Many people believe they mean well in producing an asic line but they have no core experience in bringing a asic products to market .
Bryan Micon of Seals with Clubs fame; a leading advocate of consumer protection for the bitcoin community has BFL labeled as nothing less than a scam. Without a product or update this week regardless of their eventual output I am not sure they can reasonably repair their image to that of their initial projections.

No one has been able to implement the regular scripts without crashing a client.... part of the scripting protocol is not implemented in the main bitcoin network, only the testnets.  I think ultimately mastercoin aims to be a full feature programmable tx layer without compromising the underlying bitcoin network as the full implementation of the scripting layer has been shown to do.  
TLDR; its more user and network friendly.

I think this is a side effect of the price being &gt; $10 and divisible by 8 places,  8 months ago you could by &gt; 5 bitcoins for less then $100 not that is not the case but you can still buy .0X bitcoins for less than $100...  this is a side efect that the exchanges might not have considered as a imminent threat.  When you add the volumes up into blocks of trades it looks fine but when you have to process 100x the number of trades per block (metaphorical) it taxes the trade engine alot more.

How do you prevent a ddos on the central trade engine, if it is open source people will pick and share their findings of the trade engine ip which then have to bare the burden of trade requests and a ddos which is what is happening now.
You still multiple exchanges with multiple trade engines so there is not one easy to target point of failure.  Exchanges other then MtGox need to tighten their security, and audit the trade engines to professional standards so they can find more clients to use their platform....

I think the price got ahead of the adoption for a little bit but with the euro situation bitcoin found a highly valued utility among a much wider audience... with each watershed moment similar to these modern situations the value of bitcoin is realized.
You are probably smarter than I and that said this is the question i had to put upon myself; if I do invest it because Bitcoin as an idea; a p2p exchanges of value is solid, workable, and indeed a valid solution to the modern complexity of finance and value exchange in a networked world.

As foresaid; the first bubble never popped.  A DDOS on an exchange that could not safely upgrade as fast as demand had a lapse in ability to meet trading volume while fending off a DDOS whence panic selling ensued.

I think its a matter of inaction and lack of interest in using the scripting features.  The core devs seem involved int helping master coin fit on the block chain without interfering with it.  Mastercoin and Colored coin have similar aims via different methods.  Besides Mike Hearns talk from a  year or so ago I do not find my self hearing or reading about the next great service being implemented via the scripting protocol.  Unless that is part amir taki's dark wallet; but his latest posts have been all about the core devs moving away from the purity of bitcoin...

AS the price gets high people buy bitcoins in smaller units but that means there are more orders to process for the exchanges.  Normally we and they are looking at the aggregated number of bitcoin volume moving in and out of the market in usd.  When there is a DDOS as many suspect; the volume of transactions is beyond what they are used to processing because there are not 1000 trades &lt; 1.000000 bitcoins plus all the &gt; 1.000 btc trades that were bought 6 months ago happening all at the same time.

Why would they not use alternative channels to join spamking in smoking the central bitcoin service servers???  Its a free market  when something is unregulated so the dynamics are as varied as the imagination.  When you use visa or mastercard it is a vcurr with accounts immediately tied to your local currency....  Bitcoin is not necessarily better than the established value transport systems in its technology; its just not tied to government regulations that add costs to doing business that traditional systems have to comply with.

I like bitcoin but the community is becoming a tech savvy hipster versions of Scrooge while posturing as fighting against an unfair financial system...

It can exist with namecoin which is a key value store underneath the domain registry
We could create a service protocol were people register their green address  as the key and the value is a pgp key, name, trade reputation, 3rd party verification etc

You should be trying to understand it all before you profit from it.... thats the real problem.

I can sell you these over amazon payments if you like; here is an overview of the alternative currencies to bitcoin.
There is:
    a system that uses the bitcoin protocol to maintain a key value store in the truly public cloud.  It is being used to host the domain .bit at the moment
 
    a fork of the bitcoin codebase that is exponentially more difficult for gpus to process (initially it was said to be gpu proof but this was worked around, asics might work wround this one day too)
  
    an energy efficient version of bitcoin
    a bitcoin with twice as many coins rewarded twice as fast
    an inflationary bitcoin
Most bitcoin users disdain these coins as they are just copies of something that is not yet broke; but should the bitcoin system have a flaw in its economics or code these coins might be worth something some day...  Namecoin is the currency with the most utility, liteocoin has a large user base (not large in the bitcoin sense just more than anyone else)  Terracoin PPC have alot of fans too.
Rumors about MT Gox starting to trade litecoin and namecoin are looking to be true.

Get some finance legal people on board.
It cost Mt. Gox 25 million in regulation conformance with US law.
