You can also convince yourself that the convicted felon Roger Ver, who has done nothing but lie, cheat and deceive to make his fortune is a good guy. He has done nothing but take. 
After this latest scam with Coinbase, that literally rattled $100 billion dollars out of the crypto market cap, millions are learning about this creep and will hold him and his enablers at Coinbase accountable. 
The one thing that the crypto community needs in order to grow is integrity. Ver has shown over and over again that he has none. Coinbase has joined him in this.

Agreed, but I’ll make the coffee or give back-rubs ... anything to help it move along. 
BTW-couldn’t they get to work faster in lambos?

I’d have to partialy disagree with you: it is now older code that cast off the developer community and has a one-trick, temporary, solution that will quickly max out. 
Free coins won’t save em when the duct-tape falls off.

Agreed, and we do need to HODL and move on. 
That said, we do not need to be happy about the actions of "Vermen": anyone who supports or promotes the egotistical, immature and destructive actions of Ver and his absolutely shameful representation of the crypto community.

Thanks! I love that point that $9600 = 1 Million Yen! I'm giving a shirt with this design to a friend who is going to Tokyo next week. Great observation!

I love all the crazy memes and have actually started my own shop ([hodling.io]( It would be a bit of work, but I think it would be fun to make custom designs like this. Should I do it?
