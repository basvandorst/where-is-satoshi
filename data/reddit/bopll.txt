If I already have a private key exported then I just sweep it from the new address?  Or does the fact that its only one key screw me?

It says "no inputs found".  Which I am interpreting to mean that this private key doesn't actually belong to the wallet I need... Which makes no sense since I haven't had any other wallets on this drive... But I dont exactly know where this key came from.  All i know is that its about a year old, is just one single key, and I saved it as "electrum_private" ... Obviously not a full sweep

Ah, well that didnt work unfortunately.  Oh well, I'm screwed :-/ thanks for the help

No dice :-/ 
I'm seeing a "freeze" option on the addresses, what does that do?  If it does what I think it does, would it be worthwhile to freeze the destination address until I hear back from customer support for the source wallet?
Edit: nevermind.  I think its time to try and crack this sucker.

About $2000.  Live and learn indeed.
I'm holding onto hope that I can crack the password just based off of what I remember... Shot in the dark.  Either that or this key sweep thing works.  I have an old private key saved...

You say private key, but I assume you mean password/seed?  I dont have those backed up anywhere (sad, I know) but electrum does give me an option to export a private key... I am not sure what that would be used for.
