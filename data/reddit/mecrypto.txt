Eth and IOTA... Hey as long as we are talking about centralized systems, better invest in PayPal as it will always be faster than both.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:58:16
Because devs typically suck at marketing

Good, he should be scared. Satoshi is the Don that hunts down banksters.

Congratulations you have unlocked the next level! Most new people have not reached this level and are still buying alts...

If we want the best of both worlds, implement Drivechains. By using Drivechains, we can create a chain that has larger blocks, dynamic blocks etc... Drivechains allow us to have our cake and eat it too.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:18:11
Should marginally make Electronics cheaper!
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:53:43
Sidechains (and more specifically Drivechains) IMHO, are most important and should be implemented as quickly as is safely possible.

No, traders already use 'sats,' just use Satoshis
@_date: 2018-08-06 15:31:30
Perhaps I misunderstood your comment. Do you agree, the original claim that this is 200m in jewels is not correct and this is actually 100m in jewels?
@_date: 2018-08-06 13:33:57
In accounting you value inventory based on cost. Depending on his margins, his inventory is probably closer to 100m.

Traders already say 'sats' when referring to anything less than 1 coin.
.1 is 'ten million sats'.
.09 is 'nine million sats'

~~More foundry cost details: [List of Foundries](    
    
~~Very rough estimate would be 3 Billion. For this amount of money I expect this could be done as a token sale or regular crowdfund as a non profit.~~
Update: Foundry not needed. Would want to work with existing foundry.
@_date: 2017-11-25 14:59:03
@_date: 2017-04-15 21:53:34
Yeah, few years ago.
@_date: 2017-04-15 17:53:56
Great, yeah we would keep it outside of any country with a valid patent. In fact it probably would be good sense to patent Asicsboost, and then immediately release the patent, anywhere it is not currently patented.    Does anyone have, or know someone with, a very good understanding of Chinese patents?
@_date: 2017-04-15 21:28:24
Regardless, do you agree, ceteris paribus, that more Asic companies are a good thing?
@_date: 2017-04-15 18:20:13
Do you know if anyone on the other post, actually have started working on a croudfund or ICO?    
Or if they have started working on this at all?    
Edit: added question.
@_date: 2017-04-15 20:30:39
The lowest I was able to find is 16nm found [here]( beneath BM1385.
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:32:23
As vjeuss pointed out, a foundry and a few billion is not needed. What we need is the design and contracting with an existing foundry. 
With the Asicsboost patent, what stops us from forming a company in a different county and having chips made with the same Asicsboost advantage? Obviously assuming we were to raise the needed funds for the chip run.
Edit: spelling
@_date: 2017-04-15 19:47:17
Exactly. This is not to be some fly-by-night operation, BFL repeat. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:48:22
If people were willing to throw ~$180 million at the DAO, it seems odd more people have not tried to raise ~$10 million to create mining competition. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 01:46:25
Yes, only specialists. The only way that I will continue to pursue this is if I can get the best in the industry as I'm not interested in wasting my time, money, and others' money on some half-ass chip designers and a BFL repeat.
@_date: 2017-04-15 18:53:12
Just reached out to Alex, Thanks!
@_date: 2017-04-16 01:21:00
Could not agree more, this is why I have reached out to a handful of people today and started this discussion. If I have community support, I will get this done.
@_date: 2017-04-15 23:02:28
Okay, sounds good. Let us know, we are happy to help with the filing fees if needed.
@_date: 2017-04-15 16:23:17
Agreed. Learning more, from comments and research, as I delve further into what this would require. 
@_date: 2017-04-16 01:37:01
Do you know what the legal implications would be, in regards to the patent, if we were to do an ICO where the coins could be used to rent mining time (something akin to AWS, Azure, G Cloud etc..), rather than selling the chips outright?
@_date: 2017-04-16 02:43:22
Thanks for the support. I'll checkout IDA Ireland!
@_date: 2017-04-16 02:51:07
No worries, I'm technical but am not afraid to admit that I do not have experience with chip design. With not many other companies entering the mining space, I understood it to be the case that there was a pretty strong monopoly on foundries that could manufacture a bitcoin asics chip, obviously this is not the case.
@_date: 2017-04-16 04:53:51
Do you have any evidence of chips that are smaller than 16nm?
@_date: 2017-04-15 18:44:36
Does this look correct?

@_date: 2017-04-15 16:18:27
Excellent point. I looked [here]( and found that Bitmain is/was using [TSMC]( to manufacture their chips.

Good work. paste an address and I'll shoot you some coin.

Demand is limitless -- everyone wants to consume. Nobody needs to encourage others to spend money. Spending money can be done by any idiot, what is hard is production. 
What is important to understand is capital structure.
Why deflation is good: one man's savings is another man's capital equipment loan. Savings allow us to invest in our ability to produce and export goods for a profit. The profits are then saved, making us all wealthier.
This debate can be boiled down to 1. going into debt to consume (for losers) vs 2. saving to produce (for winners).
@_date: 2018-02-24 14:24:47
To buy and hold BTC, is to short the financials.
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:52:59
No, I said one man's savings is another man's capital equipment loan.
That loan, by definition, is going into debt to produce.

You linked me to a specific section of the video... I'm guessing that was a mistake.
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:26:50
In response to the video, what conspiracy against core devs?

Thank you. We will implement a dedicated warrant canary page that follows the examples you linked.
