I understand, I am not part of the dev team. So I couldnt adjust their financial side, I am just a chatbox mod.

There are many methods that Dwolla/MTGox offers for users to purchase Bitcoins through a variety of processors. BTC-E however does not accept payments like Paypal/Visa/Mastercard due to the nature of attempts to chargeback.

In my opinion having a chatbox is what made BTC-E continue to grow at an even more faster rate. It got people to network with other people, ask questions when support isnt around, and overall have a good time.
I do know there are trolls and I spend countless hours removing them from chat.

I personally believe the chatbox is a tool used as a means of discussing, reporting and communicating with one another.
If you ask me, there have been many traders from MtGox and Vircurex who come on btc-e just to chat and trade as it allows them to enjoy their time while investing in cryptocurrency.

There was no security breach. They just added an email login to prevent people from bruteforcing peoples accounts.

BTC-E gets a large number of DDOS Attacks on a daily basis, but this just means that theyre improving on buying many more servers. If we dont have these issues dealt with now, then there wont be a future for cryptocurrency trading platforms.

As a moderator on BTC-E. This picture has NOTHING to do with  and therefor you guys can ignore this without worrying about your funds.
