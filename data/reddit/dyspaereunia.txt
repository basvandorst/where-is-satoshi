I hear ya. I have a collection of paper money. Some notes I have spent over $1000 on. I don't plan on selling but I do have delusions that they're going to double-triple in value. The Zimbabwe note was a novelty I bought just to have the oddity. Didn't think it would have any legitimate value. You should ebay half your notes and exchange it for bitcoin.

Hilarious this thread. Bitcoin hits $12k and we're talking about how awesome it is that our $100trillion dollars notes are somehow valuable.  ��

Is that 90K₿?

He's fudging his statistics.

Actually I bought the note in 2013 for $5 and it goes for $20 something last I heard. So I just hope the bubble doesn't burst. 
edit: [$65]( . Something ironic about an inflationary currency now defunct now worth 13 times what it was worth 4 years ago.
