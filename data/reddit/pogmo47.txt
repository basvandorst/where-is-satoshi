any detail on the UI? I really feel a good market is to license a  standalone UI with libraries, source etc and let punters go nuts with their own ATM animals, they could get supported by a yearly license etc. Anyone see an open source version UI?

I can only tell you what I know..
What I know is that I have used Coinjar for many months and they are great. You can ring them.. speak to them.. ask them directly what went down in the past if it is relevant, it's the Australian way. 
Cut through the bullshit, plenty of keyboard cats here with no balls to ever pick up a phone and ask the guy what the deal is or was.. my opinion anyway.. 
Call &gt;&gt;

ok! &gt; Steve is taking his neighbour to court for compensation of loss and damages. The GM farmer is being supported by pro GM lobby group the Pastoralists &amp; Graziers Association. This case is the first of its kind in the world, where an organic farmer is seeking compensation from a GM farmer when his rights have been violated by GM contamination.

News from China Devastating for who? and what? ..  explain
No government will let Bitcoin potentially undermine their own currency. A threat to the local currency is a threat to the existence of governments and financial institutions.
-- True &gt; I still cannot see it being &gt;&gt;banned&lt;&lt; from any country   regulated &gt; ok
If some merchants are pulling Bitcoin support, this is also very bad. If people have no means of spending Bitcoin, it doesn't have any real value and the growth of Bitcoin will be capped.
--Where? China? Baidu? anywhere else? don't think so..
The purpose of Bitcoin is to be decentralised and require no government or bank to control it. Bitcoin reacting to the news from China is proof that the currency can easily be regulated by governments.
-- Bitcoin traders reacting to making money ..  People who spent more then they can afford .. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 07:34:24
fucking skeptics everywhere, bullshitters never explain the last 18 months like this lol..
What excites me is that Big Governments think about it.. think about that.. they actually give a shit about some code... Now that is cool and a positive in my opinion, that this Bit is that confronting, game changing etc that massive governments of the world will give dialogue to it..  to alter it's course..  to steer their ship away from the Bitberg.
Buying from $70 up is real skin in the game and see this as actually a bigger punt than a dungeon child cranking out Bits while jacking it to Britney Spears in 2009.
Cheers &amp; Beers man..

I have been thinking along these same lines for a while, imagine indy film makers being able to embed a QR in a story line and punter able to hit it.
turning up behind a news presenter with a bitcoin qr sign actually rewards the effort for the punter but also educates the masses.
