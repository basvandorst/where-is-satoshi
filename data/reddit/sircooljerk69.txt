Hilary lost - the election win was for winning the electoral college votes - that was the contest, not pop vote. Hilary knew about the electoral college thing, and spent a billion dollars trying to win it. Trump knew it was about EC votes, that’s why he campaigned hard in all the flyover states.

A cpl weeks ago, CNN finally did a report on Bitcoin and brought in their top finance expert who presented a basic story on the simple rising value of Bitcoin. Her final analysis: "At $16000, its too pricey for me to buy in!" -That's the "experts" we are dealing with....

You can't say or think "What if?!?!" 
You may as well beat yourself up over "what if I picked the right lotto numbers" -but you didn't / so it don't matter.
When "ifs" and "buts" are chocolate and nuts it will be Christmas every day....

My wife knows nothing about Bitcoin or that I even bought some a while ago. I decided to tell her about it last night and after 3 explanations of what it is and how we'd multiplied our investment exponentially, her eyes widened and she shrieked: "Quick quick sell it all..... ahhhh no, NO! No, let's buy more right away!!!"
