You seem to be the sort of savvy young go-getter we're interested in. I encourage you to consider joining team Blockstream. We still have some exciting positions available.

I have a question. 
About this: A person wishing to claim the bounty would have to send information such as the time and place of the killing in advance. **The contract would pay out after verifying that those details had appeared in several trusted news sources, such as news wires.** 
How does a contract verify details with news wires?

For fork success there needs to be a super-majority of 75% iirc.

You're right. How dare I. That was a horrible thing to say. Just downvoted myself.

I don't understand how you can say Bitcoin wants to be anything. Bitcoin is what it is and whatever it is 'store of value' isn't it, whatever that even means.

Sympathy for the devil. Can't blow stolen loot on testnet!
By early 2012, a small group of Mt. Gox employees, all of whom worked on one-year contracts, began to worry that customer funds had been diverted to cover operating costs that they estimated to be rising. Those costs included rent in a Tokyo high-rise that also housed offices for Hulu and Google, high-tech gadgets such as a robot and a 3-D printer and a souped-up, racing version of the Honda Civic imported from Britain for Karpeles, people who have reviewed expenses said.

The current system where every user is a network node is not the intended configuration for large scale. That would be like every Usenet user runs their own NNTP server. The design supports letting users just be users.
