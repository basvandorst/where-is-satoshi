But to what avail? What do they gain from investing their own money? They aren't asking me to put in my own money.

So today someone offered to help me invest in crypto by putting their btc money into a wallet in my name. The caveat is This money had to be sent to their portfolio managing company (which I cant find anything about) to be compounded etc. They said all I had to do was give them their initial investment back (in installments) as the interest payments start to roll in. Then they asked 40 more people to do the same. "Congratulations your a millionaire"..... 
Now the skeptic in me screams dodgy. What is the deal here?? Is it possible to launder money in this way?? Hiding assets?  Why would someone do this? I have trouble buying the "good heart" theory but I'd love to understand this. Any insite appreciated.

I appreciate you taking the time to reply. Unfortunately I know alot of people who have dove into this "deal of a lifetime". Friends. Family. How do they get out? They cant see the money now in the hands of the portfolio mgmt. I'm glad I steered clear.

How do they gain money from this if all I'm giving them is the initial back? Are they controlling more on their end then what i can see? Are they secretly the "portfolio manager"?

Could they be using this money to manipulate a stock?
