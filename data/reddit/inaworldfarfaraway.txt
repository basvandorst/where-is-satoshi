or if you read this and don't buy BCH, are you being manipulated?

Simple, Bitfinex is printing USDT for cheap. That's why he went there...

The reason I phrased it that way was because I saw multiple times where Gavin Andresen said he believed it was Craig S. and have "proof", thus my reason for asking to disprove.

Totally depends on the length of flight. Transatlantic, for example, these type of seats on british or american is called business (wtih first being almost identical with slightly more room). Short haul is much different with Euro Airlines First Class being more of a joke.

Not trying to troll, but do you have any good articles to disprove it was Craig? Asking b/c my initial reaction was that he was faking it, but have seen a few (i.e. more than 1 doc/article) where Gavin Andresen has said he believes it was Craig S. and that he has the seen the private keys etc.

Thanks for the info. Havent read yet, but shocked that Gavin "the super smart btc developer" was so gullible, apparently...I wonder if we'll ever know...

I think were saying the same thing. Business/first is the same thing typically for short haul and the blocked middle seat is what is used in Europe and is what I was saying is a joke.

Thanks for taking the time to explain. As someone who doesn't have time to surf this subreddit and come up with all of these conclusions myself, it's very helpful. I'm sure my comments about asking for opposing proof will be downvoted, but hey that's reddit.

Pasting same comment as I did to another person.

With all due respect, your link to a few comments doesn't answer my question.
