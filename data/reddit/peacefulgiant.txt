Man I cannot believe this, I obviously did not explain the technique well enough for you to understand. I thought it was pretty simple, but I guess I have all the data so it's easy for me to see. 
I edited the OP to include the fees for each transaction and the profits made by the thief at each iteration. The 4 TX is 1 iteration, there were over 1,000 transactions completed so each profit soon adds up. High fees, but what the fuck does that matter when the profits are all yours.
Look I was wrong with my first %11 fee, I didn't take into account the fees for *both* buy and sell transactions. The full fee for a whole iteration of the loop (me:sell, thief:buy, thief:sell, me:buy) will cost him 17.68%, which is a lot, but considering &gt;82% is pure profits, wtf has he got to lose. Do you honestly think the attacker is going to run his script (without modification) for hours on end, transferring my balance at a FUCKING loss??
Sorry, but my god it is frustrating. People telling me the thief must not be making a profit, when he drained my account with transactions occurring multiple times per second, over a course of multiple hours. He knows what he was doing, he's not stupid. I have all the data in front of me, it's pretty simple. But you all are pretty dull, or maybe I'm just not explaining it properly. If you can't figure out the OP, then just give up and move on. But don't accuse me of not understanding, I'm the one who figured out how he did it in the first place &gt;.&gt;

I am a believer in cryptos and still am. I think it's a wise investment. But I should not have stored them on the exchange, I just didn't think something like this would happen to me.

I have paid the same fees as he has, as our accounts were "mirroring" each others trades. The fees were not too substantial (~ 11%).

The exchange could implement an algorithm to detect this type of attack and stop it, before it gets serious. So in some sense, the exchange could have prevented this whole thing. In the future, I believe all popular exchanges will have this safety net, but we're still in early stages of crypto exchanges, so unfortunately these safety nets do not exist yet.
Just take a look at all the safety surrounding internet banking, there is a lot of it. Back when internet banking was new, there were a lot of unknown vulnerabilities. It takes time for safety algorithms to be thought of, designed and implemented.

Partially, the attacker did not take everything. I am not sure why. In fact he performed multiple attacks over a course of 24 hours, with pauses between attacks. The account was vulnerable for several days, before I realized what had happened.
Sorry I misunderstood the question, let me clarify. I had *thought* I had deleted the keys. When I logged into the exchange and deleted the keys, the exchange took quite some time to load and once it finally did load, the keys appeared to be deleted. However, I later found out the keys were not deleted and the website must have bugged out. 
For this particular exchange, they implement a UI design, where in the site appears to have loaded the page, when in-fact it is still loading data from the server under the hood, without indicating this to the user (usually a loading indicator is used here).

Sorry, I don't think you understand. Our trades are mirrored, so the fees I received are identical to the fees he would receive. He would make 89% profit, minus any withdraw fees. Read *The Thieves Technique* section of the OP for the full explanation.

Turns out the exchange does not care at all about the hacker, even though they're on their (the exchanges) platform and can be easily identified. They have told me that they're sorry but they won't do anything about it (except lock my account until I prove I am the owner).
If I had access to their database I could find this guy in under 5 minutes. It's honestly sickening how they are protecting this hacker. I guess these attacks do make them a lot of money, so why would they care :/

I deleted the keys from the repository and thought I deleted them from the exchange. However their website is not great and displayed my API keys as "deleted" when I clicked delete. In reality, the page was still loading under the hood and the keys were not deleted. Pages do this all the time to load data dynamically (e.g. via javascript AJAX to PHP) - but usually there is a loading indicator, in this case they did not display any such indicator. 
In short, due to the absence of keys on the html page, I assumed the keys had been deleted.

Very shortsighted on my behalf. I didn't consider this kind of attack, thought i was kind of safe if the worst the case happened, as the keys only granted trade access. The app doesn't have much to do with the crime, it's only relevant to the story to explain how the keys were leaked. The app was just used to aid in placing many trades in one go. A modified version might have even been used against me in this attack.

I'm sorry for your misunderstanding. Are you sure you read the OP?
I understand your point and I'm telling you the fees incurred will be close to identical, regardless if you're the attacker or victim in this scenario.
 If the exchange had large fixed fees per transaction, then you're argument would have more merit,. But in this case, they use dynamic fees based on percentage, instead of fixed fees.

I will consider this. Thank you for your support,

Totally agree, I should have triple checked the keys were deleted from the exchange and repository. Instead I played with fire and got burnt,  badly.

It wasn't hard coded. They were stored in a file in the root directory of the repo, I had added the files previously with message to user `replace with api key`, and ran commands `--assume-unchanged`. But I switched to another pc and used `git add .` without reviewing the commit. Silly mistake. I know now to add files individually.

I see. Well that makes sense, I'm sure you were not, but the general response here has been quite negative. I understand crypto holders don't want to hear bad news and I understand it was my fault this happened. It is quite frustrating for me and I'm not doing well handling this change. Appreciate your understanding. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 14:57:12
Yes you are right. I realized this after making this mistake. The app did read the file only once,  then stored in memory. But for better safety the file should have been outside the repo folder.
