No one gives a shit about Bitcoin any more. It was a fun idea for a while, it created a minor bit of movement, and started planting seeds for future evolutions of currency. In terms of its actual success though, it's fucked. If you don't want to piss away your money needlessly, sell before it's worthless.

That is an impossible statement to either prove or disprove. You have no idea of the depth and breadth of the systemic impact that patents have had on our world, and even if you had a reasonable hypothesis you wouldn't be able to test it anyway. 


Well, it doesn't divert effort away from the D in R&amp;D, in fact that's what patents support. You can argue they divert effort away from explorative research, although you can't solely blame patents and IP law for that. The entire research funding model is skewed towards to applied end of the research spectrum; that is a function of managerial short-term-ism. 


The problem with not having any monopolistic protection whatsoever is that inter-firm competition massively increases. Now, of course it brings down the cost to consumers. That is a function of 'perfect competition' but the problem with anything approaching perfect competition is that the entire capitalist paradigm relies on businesses making profit. It's impossible to know what sort of society would exist if a central tenet of Western civilisation was removed.

I do understand ad hominem, and indeed you saying I "*clearly* don't" shows that you're more than willing to enter into ad hominem debate yourself. 
I didn't read those papers, no, and not because I don't believe what they say. I'm sure someone can spend lots of time picking holes in patents, I've spent some time doing it myself. But just because someone can make a counter argument to someone doesn't mean that the thing they're arguing against has no validity. Patents have had a tremendous impact on the way that the industrialised world operates. Some manifestations have no doubt been bad, but others have facilitated innovation, as intended. 
I'm not going to waste my time digging around for evidence to support my argument. You're a sentient being with access to the Internet, go look it up for yourself if you want convincing. But you don't want to be convinced about patents, you just want to grind your axe. You only want to read materials that will conform to your bias. I recognise the limitations of patents, whereas you are unable to bring yourself to recognise their benefits.

Yes, indeed ditto. Except I add Facebook to this too. And because it neatly fits into my life I get to keep in touch with old school and university friends, and family, on a more regular basis. 
I think people (although not necessarily yourself) like to think they're making a statement by disassociating themselves from Facebook because it's too mainstream. Pretty fucking hipster if that's the case. If it doesn't add anything to your life then fine, but it adds plenty of value to millions of people's lives.

Shares are quite a lot more interesting than Bitcoin to be honest. Bitcoin is a clumsy currency used almost exclusively by tech people and hipsters. It is continuously jaded by fuckups with people drunkenly deleting wallets or putting in the wrong send address and accidentally and permanently losing their life savings.
Aside from the relative security, with shares you have partial ownership of a business, you can attend the AGM, you can invest in businesses you believe in. That's a lot more exciting and interesting than Bitcoin, which is just an overhyped complex tech currency. Not to mention the fact that Bitcoin in itself will soon be victim of the same technological disruption that created it, it won't be long until Bitcoin mk 2 comes out causing everyone to bail from mk 1 making it ultimately valueless.

Probably because people are coming to realise that Bitcoin is a pretty clumsy technical currency that is lightyears away from becoming publicly established. It probably won't be the digital currency of the future anyway, right now there are thousands of people innovating new and better currencies to disrupt Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin was an important development, but as a gateway to future currencies, not as a major contender in its own right.

One paper unpublished and the other published in the Journal of Libertarian Studies? Don't make me lol with your pseudo-intellectual bullshit. 
Patents release innovation into the public domain, without patents there wouldn't have been half the amount of knowledge transfer as there has over the past century. If you want to truly monopolise an idea or formula you don't patent it, you lock it away. 
Patents incentivise knowledge sharing by giving the innovator a period of protection. It's a fair system in principle. But of course, like any system, it's open to abuse. Unfortunately that's assholes for you, and you can't prevent people from being assholes.
Rather than abandoning the whole thing in some puerile libertarian dreamland, it's better to engage with IP/patenting to try to improve it to make it less susceptible to trolling.

Arbitrary misinformed statements and estimates plucked from thin air. Gold makes a load of useful alloys, which are used throughout electrical engineering and materials science. The reason why it's not used more in industry, isn't because it's not useful, it's because its price is ludicrously high due to the artificial inflation from commodities investment and global banks. I'm not saying gold's value is based purely on its utilitarian value, my original comment said "gold is pretty useful" - WHICH IT IS.

Ok, so miner competition does offset the problem somewhat. 
But I don't know if supply and demand, in the typical commoditised sense, works with Bitcoin does it? 
Even if there was only one Bitcoin, worth the entire current market total of Bitcoin, it could be near-infinitely subdivided couldn't it? 
In other words, excluding the issues around mining etc, is there really that much difference between between 1 Bitcoin worth 1 billion dollars, subdivided 1 billion times, into 1 billion 1/billionth of a bitcoin - and - 1 billion bitcoin worth 1 dollar each. 
I know there are technical differences, but basically, the economics wouldn't be particularly different? Thus, supply and demand dynamics would be different, right?

That's assuming that the value of Bitcoin hadn't been impacted by the slower confirmation / negative attitudes towards Bitcoin though, right? To me, and I admit I'm not an expert (at all), it seems like it's a spiral. 
The less valuable Bitcoin is -&gt; the less viable mining it becomes -&gt; the less effective the Bitcoin network -&gt; the less valuable Bitcoin becomes -&gt; and so on, until it completely crashes?
