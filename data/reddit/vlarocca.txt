Speaking as someone who started out mining and then switch to buying I consider this logic incorrect. Once the amount of Bitcoin received from mining was less then I was paying in electricity, I sold my miners and cut my losses. I immediately bought Bitcoin with the money made from the miners because I believed Bitcoin's price would go up.

"Bitcoin Is The Solution
Regardless of how anyone wants to look at it, the squabble between different local fiat currencies is destabilizing the global economy. If financial experts truly want to create a stable economic level all over the world, we will need to transition to a global currency. Right now, Bitcoin is the only suitable candidate, as it works the same in every country and has no central oversight. "

@_date: 2015-12-15 17:44:46
Great article laying out very logical arguments for Bitcoin. I bookmarked it!
Here's one example:
"Bitcoinist: Can you tell our readers your opinion of Altcoins?
Daniel KrawiszDK: The value of a currency is caused by how widely demanded it is. The reason you hold cash is because you know you can very easily get rid of it in exchange for whatever you need at any time. The interesting thing about that is the more that people want cash, the more objectively useful it is. This is what I mean by the network effect. If the network effect really is the explanation for the value of a currency, as I claim it is, then it becomes very difficult to imagine how two currencies could be in equilibrium with one another. Any trend which promoted the growth of one at the expense of the other would tend to reinforce itself: for the growth of the network inherently improves the usefulness of the currency, thus attracting more people to it regardless of the original reason that the growth took place.
I think that altcoins are networks of people who talk a lot about issues that would be moot without answers to fundamental questions about the economics of their situation, which they have consistently been unable to provide. For example, a necessary prerequisite before I would invest in a currency other than Bitcoin would be an explanation as to how it will beat Bitcoin. If you’re not even going to try to do that, then from an investment standpoint, I would say that you might as well not bother creating the altcoin at all."

"The strength behind Blockchain technology is in the authenticity of records, content and transactions, and its decentralised nature. Which opens up the possibilities of many use cases beyond FinTech.
Proof of ownership of digital purchases and content
Proof of authorship of digital goods and content
Digital trading, transaction history, transfer and ownership authenticity
Code authorship in application development
As Mike Gault described above, every type of document and type of record could be made a part of blockchain technology. In which case, every piece of transacted data within the Internet Of Things, every handshake between devices and the parsing of information between them, could also become part of the blockchain. From a corporate point of view, this is invaluable and the backbone of the Industrial Internet.
The consumer side of IOT is far different, and I’ll tackle that in another article.
For Blockchain, this is only the beginning. Take the following definition as a hint: a distributed database that serves as a public ledger."

Great explaination why Blockchains can't exist w/o tokens: "A block chain without an economically valuable token reduces to a centralized system or database.
This  is because the consensus mechanisms used by blockchains \(Proof\-of\-Work  and Proof\-of\-Stake, the algorithms that generate the blocks of any  chain\) are ultimately rooted in the economic self\-interest of the miners  and/or stakers. A blockchain without an economically valuable token  lacks the incentive to encourage consensus and will promptly either stop  functioning or be overtaken by spam."

I would think that wider adoption and greater distribution would flatten out the fluctuations. 2/3rds of the limited supply is already in existence, with only 21 million serving the universe for all time. it would have to be a money on a small scale or get much more expensive overtime, doesn't that mean further volatility?

Seems to me this is just the Laws of Supply and Demand at work. Demand is low right now in comparison to supply. This is why the price is going down. Supply increased because miners and retailers and early speculators put there coins on the market faster then consumers demanded them. 
Speculators who were buying began to leave the market for various reasons. Government policy, less profit, more risk, less confidence, more fear. 
Finally and mostly when a enthusiast wants into the Bitcoin scene now, it's getting cheaper to buy it on the open vs mine it. Again the laws of supply and demand at work.

I think he nails the heart of the matter: 
“For all of the reasons why the blockchain is exciting and has the potential to change the world, it’s really only possible because it’s secure — it has the capacity to process large amounts of transactions. The only reason it’s secure and has that capacity is because there’s a bunch of miners around the world that are dedicating energy, money, and time to mine bitcoin. The reason why they’re doing it is not because they’re good citizens; they’re doing it because they want to make money. And they make money by receiving bitcoin through rewards and transaction fees, so if you eliminate the money making opportunity from mining you’re [not going to have the proper incentives to secure the blockchain].”

"Hill: All right. Here's something we haven't talked about in... I don't even remember the last time we talked about bitcoin, but we're going to talk about bitcoin.
I feel like, if he's listening over in Germany, Matt Koppenheffer is smiling, if not outright laughing at me, because I've been bearish on bitcoin from the start, and over the past year, the price of bitcoin has quadrupled. It broke the $1,000 mark last week, and it's dipped back down. But you're someone, like Matt Koppenheffer, who's been pretty bullish on bitcoin. First, before we dig into the news with bitcoin, tell me why. Why the bull case for bitcoin? Because, to me, it just seems like Monopoly money, it seems like a made-up currency, and as I have admitted before, the fact that the Winklevoss twins were involved in this doesn't help the bull case, in my opinion.
Erickson: Right. This is kind of an ethereal discussion here, Chris. There's a lot of speculation in bitcoin right now. We don't have any stocks tied to this --
Hill: Not yet. We'll get to that.
Erickson: Yes, exactly. But it is a very interesting story. Just, generally, my personal thesis, disclaimer, I own one bitcoin, have had quite a year with that. [laughs] 
Hill: Congratulations, that's worked out well for you.
Erickson: But, I think there's just a lot of transactional friction in the way that we buy and sell things today. Think about it, we're build off of a financing infrastructure. You have a bank account that you have a credit card that ties into, you pay your statement at the end of the month, and every step along the way, somebody is taking a small piece of this. But it's the way that we built it out over the last several decades. And if you build a digital infrastructure correctly, as bitcoin did and Blockchain is trying to do, you don't need a lot of those steps. It's basically digital cash. I always think about it as, you're handing a digital dollar to somebody, and that's it. There's no statements. There's no financing. There's no APR at the end of the year, anything like that. But to do that, there's a lot of regulators who don't like that because you can do bad things with that. You can't track the person giving you the cash at the end of the day and various other things. That's had bitcoin held back on what its true potential, possibly, could be. But at the end of the day, you're starting to see more and more transactions using bitcoin all across the globe, not just in the United States, but in China and Japan and a bunch of different places. Because bitcoin is going to tap out at 21 million bitcoins, once they're mined, you have a fixed supply and increasing demand, and that's pushing the value of each one bitcoin up over the years.
Hill: We've seen this run up over the past 12 months, and you look at the fact that the SEC is considering three separate potential bitcoin ETFs. Considering approval of any one of the three. Let's say one of them gets approved -- what kind of run-up are we going to see then? Because if we're seeing this run-up now... this actually gets me, I don't want to say bullish on bitcoin, but it gets me slightly less bearish as an investor, because ETFs are a way that a lot of people invest if they're looking to get exposure to something without really having the concentrated upside and, therefore, downside of a single stock. I'm not looking to buy a bitcoin, but I'm slightly more interested in a bitcoin ETF. What happens if they actually approve one of these things?
Erickson: Sure. On the continuum of uncertainty, it goes down a notch. If the SEC is going to say, "This is alright, to create bitcoin ETFs," and they have until March 11th, I believe, to approve of this, but the people who said, "No way, this is too early, I have so many questions about this even being possible," those people will start saying, "You know, this still sounds speculative to me, but I think it's interesting now that the SEC is behind it." Basically, anything new, almost all of innovation has got a zillion questions when it first gets introduced that, over time, as it grows and gets more and more approvals or people behind it, the questions tend to either linger or go away. And I think that's what you're seeing with bitcoin. That's what the SEC decision is going to have an impact on this."

Great list, have to consider Volatility as a factor that works against Bitcoin as a form of Money, but possibly for it as an investment, and store of value. Also, major controversial changes by soft fork seem to be very improbable this again is either a plus or minus, depending on the way you use Bitcoin.

Thanks for your thoughtful response. "Casey observes that the feds,
like to blame a lot of the problems on a lack of transparency, but with blockchain and the Fedcoin technology, they can see everything, everywhere. So it’s complete transparency ….Without cash, you have no privacy. If you have to put everything through a bank account, the government knows exactly what you’re buying, what you’re selling, how much you are earning. They’re in complete control; able to take what they want…including your entire account if you become politically undesirable."

Great analysis of the defensive strengths of Bitcoin's decentralized network. It argues that decentralized networks are a great defense to manipulation by bad actors.

|Baxter pointed to bitcoin miners dropping out of the network as evidence that the cryptocurrency's economics failed to "stack  up". 
The law of supply and demand is primary to economics. This logic is counter-intuitive to economic realities. When prices/demand go down, suppliers (in this case minors) leave the market.

4. Yahoo, which tracks Bitcoin USD price in their Yahoo Finance section.
7. Wikipedia, which has accepted Bitcoin donations last summer.
19. eBay, which is using PayPal to test Bitcoin applications before they join in the future
32. Reddit is not only a merchant that accepts Bitcoin but has one of the most active Bitcoin forums online.
34. WordPress, which has been one of the longest merchant partners of Bitcoin since November of 2012. Plus, now they have many plug-ins to help member WordPress sites accept Bitcoin as well.
39. PayPal has recently accepted Bitcoin as we covered last fall.
48. Microsoft, the largest company ever to accept Bitcoin, was brought into the fold last month to close 2014. This makes seven of the top 50 websites worldwide as Bitcoin acceptors or partners in principle. (eBay is not counted among them.)
64. xHamster is the second largest porn website after XVideos based on online traffic volume, and has accepted Bitcoin since last summer.
76. ESPN integrates Bitcoin not through payments, but as a major sponsor with a three-year college football bowl endorsement deal. “Bitcoin Bowl” winning teams can accept their winning prize share in Bitcoins.
99. Wikia.com, which is a derivative of Wikipedia-Wikimedia, making the running total ten out of the Top 100 worldwide websites.

I believe your right on Bitcoin not depreciating in the long run it appreciates and is inflationary because of scarcity. Difficulty increases when more miners enter the market and keeps the Block creation times at a standard of 10 minutes and keep the rewards constant at 25 bitcoins every 10 minutes. Adding more bitcoins every 10 minutes needs a corresponding demand in order to keep price stable.
@_date: 2015-01-04 14:23:22
It would take the coordinated effort of governments the decentralized nature should give enough hashing power at any point in time to keep the network safe.
If I were a Bitcoin hater with that much power / money, I wouldn't buy mining power or inhibit it, I would capture the market buy printing enough money to buy a majority of the bitcoins on the open market, and destroy it with market problems in price, ect.

The exact same argument could be used for why Bitcoin will be of great worth in 20 years:
"Sulzhik believes autocratic regimes will continue their attempts to censor and ban internet, but not because it may facilitate protests and revolutions. The reason for that, Sulzhik thinks, is in using Bitcoin that may facilitate capital outflow, exchange money for any foreign currency, and provide maximum personal control over finance."

The scaricity built into Bitcoin will make it deflationary in the long run, and this has created price instability that economists have used to discredit it as money, for not meeting the criteria of being a good store of value.
This attribute was built into Bitcoin purposefully and remains on of it's main critical characteristics. In order to change this you would have to make the currency fluctuate accordding to supply and demand at any given point in time. Many altcoins have this feature as a claimed improvement to Bitcoin, but none have yet to become popular.
Crytocurrency can be built to shrink and grow in supply as demand warrants and I'm sure we'll see some variation that becomes popular that does. This could be a Bitcoin sidechain coin or an altcoin, but no one has been successful in making a popular coin with this attribute yet.

"Extension Blocks and Soft-forked Sidechains
Another idea similar to the concept of sidechains is called extension blocks. Much like sidechains, extension blocks allow users to opt-in to blocks of transactions with different validation rules.
The key difference between a traditional sidechain and an extension block is that upgraded Bitcoin full nodes validate the transactions on the extension block. This means that the extension block is tied much more closely to the main Bitcoin network than a traditional sidechain.
The level of separation between extension blocks and the Bitcoin network is almost non-existent, which means issues on extension blocks are more likely to cause issues for the entire Bitcoin network.
With sidechains, there is a layer of separation between two blockchains, which means the main chain can be protected from issues on the sidechain. For this reason, it’s likely that more experimental ventures, such as RSK, will be implemented as a sidechain rather than extension blocks.
Recently, Bitcoin Core contributor Johnson Lau posted an early version of a BIP draft for effectively increasing Bitcoin’s block size limit through the use of extension blocks.
Since extension blocks can be implemented via soft forks, the features of the extension blocks are essentially opt-in for users. Even in the case of extension blocks with a larger block size limit, users are not forced to upgrade and validate or propagate blocks that are much larger in size. Those who wish to enjoy the level of decentralization offered by 1MB blocks can continue to do so, while those who would like to experiment with much larger block size limits can do so on an opt-in basis.
Although users are able to opt-in to extension blocks, miners must upgrade to continue mining valid blocks on the main chain.
Soft-forked sidechains are similar to extension blocks, with the key difference being that soft-forked sidechains are merge-mined rather than mined as part of the main Bitcoin blockchain."

"The rise in gold and Bitcoin is the equivalent of a failing report card for the central bankers and governments around the globe. It is proof that the world is becoming dubious when it comes to the full faith and credit of governments and monetary authorities that print paper currencies. It also is a sign that people are ready for transparent alternatives that only increase or decrease in value based on actual fundamentals and not manipulation. Central banks used to provide markets with stability and comfort, these days when they speak markets react with fear and uncertainty. Central bank creditability has become an issue, and that makes currencies worth much less as an asset class."

I'm not aware of the details as to why people have migrated to the larger pools. I can say for the time that I mined I went to the pool that had the best returns as far as lowest fees taken and consistent payout. It was as simple as any supply and demand equation, I went to where i got the best price for my hashing and electric dollar. Unfortunately I found it unprofitable to mine and wound up selling my equipment and buying BTC with the proceeds and continue to buy instead of mine. Why don't you mine?

"By far the most important aspect of the report is the committee’s recommendation that the GST law should be changed to include digital currencies within the definitions of ‘money’ and ‘financial supply’. This would mean that GST would not apply to bitcoin exchange transactions, and it would only apply once when bitcoin is used to pay for goods or services."

The first time I got interested in Bitcoin is when I heard an advertisement email by Motley Fool, whom I love. They spoke of Google and other tech companies doing research about the next form of money and believing it was the next big thing. Being a computer geek I did my research by reading Andreas book and decided this new money was based on proven science and math, and began investing and using it because I believed it would improve the world and my place in it.

he asset management industry and a technology that has found favour with drug dealers do not seem like natural bedfellows. Yet blockchain, the technology that underpins bitcoin, the controversial digital currency, is being heralded as “revolutionary” for fund houses.
The nascent technology’s would-be impact on financial services has been likened to the effect the internet had on the music and media industries. Blockchain has the potential to turn the finance industry on its head, saving asset managers billions of dollars and “making the whole investing process much quicker and more transparent”, says Jeff Levi, a partner at Casey Quirk, a consultancy.

FirstFT is our new essential daily email briefing of the best stories from across the web
It is a far cry from a few years ago, when bitcoin — and by default blockchain — was labelled the “Wild West of finance”. The cryptocurrency is best known for its fluctuating value and use on the dark web, the part of the internet that is only accessible by means of special software and which is often used for criminal activity, such as buying drugs or guns.
The focus has shifted from bitcoin to blockchain, which, in essence, is a giant, online public ledger that keeps track of who owns bitcoins — and who owned it in the past. If you bought an item using bitcoin, the blockchain would record that the ownership of the digital currency has moved from the seller to you.
It is this continuous and quick recording of transactions that has the financial services industry both excited and scared. “It is a really, really exiting area for the asset management industry,” says Jackie Alvarez, who is carrying out research on blockchain for Investit, a consultancy.
Most commentators say blockchain’s biggest impact on the fund industry will be in the clearing and settlement process, the often dull side of asset management that involves moving ownership of securities from one investor to another.
When an asset manager buys a security, a large number of in-house staff and service providers set to work processing the transaction. A record of the trade is submitted to the clearing agency, often a bank, which then matches the buyer and seller records. Money to pay for the security is moved from the buyer to the seller, while the security is given to the buyer.
These labour-intensive jobs can take days, tying up cash in the process.
Widespread adoption of blockchain could mean almost instantaneous settling of securities, says Hu Liang, senior managing director of the emerging technologies centre at State Street, the US bank. “It is an efficiency play.”
Quicker settlement would also have a big effect on asset managers’ balance sheets. Fund houses would need far fewer staff for some roles, says Mr Levi.
Faster settlement “changes the whole workload. That is a fundamental change in their operating model”, adds Chris Mills, who runs the global blockchain initiative at KPMG, the consultancy.
Asset managers could get rid of their cumbersome and expensive IT systems, adds Charley Cooper, managing director of R3, a consortium of banks and fintech companies working together to use blockchain. “All of this would have a significant impact on reducing costs,” he says.
Steve Libby, co-chairman of the digital/fintech forum at Alfi, the fund industry association in Luxembourg, adds: “The knock-on effects [of faster and more accurate settling] are very positive for the asset management industry.”
Other uses for blockchain include making it easier for asset managers to trade directly with each other, cutting out traditional middlemen such as brokers.
Blockchain could furthermore play a role in preventing money laundering by helping asset managers to understand who their underlying investors are.
The adoption of blockchain by asset managers would be good news for investors, says Mr Cooper. “Any time you can make the system safer and reduce costs, that is good for investors.”
Despite all the potential uses of blockchain, few asset managers are running projects to see if the technology works.
Alex Birkin, advisory leader at EY, the consultancy, says: “A lot of asset managers are observing [the work that is being done to develop blockchain technology], rather than committing a lot of their money.”
This is in stark contrast to other parts of the financial services sector. JPMorgan Chase said last week it had begun a trial project using blockchain to cut costs and reduce the hassle of trading. The US bank is working with Digital Asset Holdings, the New York-based start-up run by Blythe Masters, best known for creating the modern credit default swap.
The Nasdaq stock exchange used blockchain for the first time in December to transfer shares.
Banks are also working together in consortiums such as R3 to see how blockchain can be used in financial markets. R3 recently opened up its membership to asset managers, although none has joined so far.
One of the reasons behind this reluctance to embrace blockchain is because of its associations with bitcoin.
“The stigma around bitcoin has distracted people from the benefits of blockchain technology and the applicability of blockchain. Had there not been the stigma around blockchain, people would have realised faster how useful the technology could be,” says Angus McLean, a partner at Simmons &amp; Simmons, the law firm.
Many asset managers still have concerns about the technology, chiefly how scalable it is and how robust the encryption is, says EY’s Mr Birkin.
Then there is asset managers’ general reluctance to embrace technologies. “In the asset industry, technological change comes at a glacial pace. It tends to come later rather than sooner,” says Amin Rajan, chief executive of Create Research, the UK-based consultancy.
Asset managers who think blockchain is not a big deal for them are mistaken, says R3’s Mr Cooper. “If you are sitting there thinking this doesn’t affect me, that is not the case.”
‘Wild West of finance’: Digital currencies grow, but concerns remain
Bitcoin has a chequered past.
Since its invention seven years ago, the digital currency has been heavily associated with crime. It has found favour with individuals looking to buy drugs or weapons on the dark net, the part of the internet that is only accessible by means of special software.
Its value has fluctuated widely. The price of a bitcoin reached a high of $1,124.75 in November 2013. It now typically trades at between $200 and $300.
There are widespread concerns about the security of the digital currency, while officials are worried about the lack of a central authority overseeing it.
Thanks to these issues, one US regulator described bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as the “Wild West of finance” in 2014.
Mike Hearn, a prominent developer of bitcoin, recently called the cryptocurrency a “failed experiment”.
Yet bitcoin is gaining some legitimacy. There are 100,000 merchants that accept bitcoin for payment, including PayPal, Expedia, the travel-booking site, and Microsoft, the technology company.
The UK also wants to become a hub for bitcoin trading and Europe’s top court ruled bitcoin should be treated as money for tax purposes.
The court’s decision “is the first step in securing bitcoin’s future as a genuine alternative to national currencies”, Richard Asquith, a vice-president at Avalara, the tax compliance company, told the FT.

Very interesting and productive approach. Mutual gain is key. 
Invent the options for mutual gain
The authors identify four obstacles to inventing the options for mutual gain:[7]
    Premature judgment: deciding on one option and failing to consider the alternatives
    Searching for one single answer
    The assumption of a fixed pie: assuming there is only a win/lose solution
    Thinking that "solving their problem is their problem"
The authors also propose four ways to overcome these obstacles:
    Separate invention process from decision making
    Broaden your options
    Search for mutual gains
    Invent ways of making their decision easy
The process of inventing should be in an informal atmosphere where the both parties sit together and brainstorm about possible solutions. Wild and creative ideas should be encouraged. After the list of possible options is made, parties should use a process of evaluation to find the most promising options. It is helpful to look for shared interests and also to create options which are appealing to other side and which they find easy to agree with.

The argument is: If the cost of a 51% attack of the network is less than the value of the market cap of the network then opening a short position and paying the cost to crash the price becomes economically feasible.
" What is the value of attacking bitcoin? It depends on who is doing it. To a speculator with a large short position in bitcoin futures, the value of attacking is the profit he would realize if bitcoin’s price were to plunge. In such a case, calculating whether bitcoin is vulnerable to attack is relatively straightforward."

"We could be the first company that goes out there and say, look, if we move US$300-billion worth of prepaid access value worldwide onto the blockchain, we would require two to three million bitcoins over the next five to ten years.

I like Bitrated and see it as having value in Bitcoin's future. 
"Reversible transactions
Registered users can use Bitrated's payment system to make reversible e-commerce transactions using 2-of-3 multisig smart contracts in its arbitrated marketplace. To do so, the buyer and seller must nominate a trust agent to act as an arbitrator for their transaction.
If the transaction goes smoothly, the buyer and seller agree and release the funds to the seller without the trust agent's intervention.
Trust agents will only intervene if a dispute arises. In this instance, they would be required to review the case and decide which party to side with, either refunding the buyer or releasing the funds to the seller."

There has been no shortage of coverage of Bitcoin and the technology surrounding it over the past year. It seems at every conference a panelist talks about the impact digital currency will have on the industry.
So it's only fitting that at the Fintech Startups Conference in New York someone decided to give their two cents on a trend that seems to continue to pick up steam in the industry.
David Jegen, managing director of Devonshire Investments, which is the private investment arm of $1.98 trillion Fidelity Investments, was that person, joking that it wouldn't be a fintech conference without mentioning blockchain, the technology behind digital currency.
"Blockchain is a great long-term opportunity for Wall Street," Jegen said. "I think especially on the clearing and settling side."
Jegen said the three things needed during settlement ─ both parties making value simultaneously, trust and something to record it all on a permanent ledger that can't be reputed ─ are all offered by blockchain.
Companies that are familiar with blockchain technology and would eventually be able to translate it to the settlement process are of particular interest for Jegen.
"We very much like companies that are trying to take that and apply it to the digital currency world today, which seems less consequential and threatening to Wall Street, but build the settlement process that could later be extended into core products like credit defaults, swaps or interest rate swaps."
It's a big opportunity, Jegen said, not only for the amount of settling that needs to be done every day in the industry, but the money it costs.
"Nobody really likes it," said Jegen of the settlement process. "In fact, the only reason Wall Street likes it is because they own a lot of the institutions that do it, like Omgeo, Swift or DTCC."

Here's one unique to Bitcoin:
Bitcoin is a groundbreaking technology based on math and crytology. It is tried and proven to have been the first form of digital currency to solve the problem of doublespending. It is quickly gaining mass acceptance as the next form of money and is destined to solve many of the current problems with fiat money, including non scarcity, inexpensive banking and transport, and decentralization that keep the greedy and unscrupulous middlemen out  of the equation.

Interesting discussion, by being amongst the daring that invest in Bitcoin we stand to win or lose significantly because of the volatility.

I agree the chances of this working are too great a risk to even try, however we need to be vigilante to our vulnerabilities. Too many of us want to subscribe to group think w/o carefully considering all future possibilities. One of the considerations for future holders is when the reward becomes so small that the network is running on fees, the fees need to be high enough to support the network or the networks maintenance costs become unfeasible. I'm sure we'll overcome all these challenges but we have to remain aware of them to do so.

There is something of real value here and it's not necessarily going to be reaped by me, but I will pioneer it!

I love this approach, it's well thought out, practical, and conservative. It takes an iterative approach to only making the blocksize as large as it needs to be to get it to the next level. It takes into account that special interest on both sides are not serving the central purposes of Bitcoin, but instead their own special interests.
I've been thinking lately that Bitcoin should have a purpose or mission statement. Something that says what it's ideal purpose would be in the future. By doing this you filter all decisions through your purpose statement and serve the ideal central interest vs the special interests of the individual actors.

To understand the equation mentioned in this part of the article is to understand some of Bitcoins greatest potential.
"As mentioned above, Bitcoin’s monetary base growth is predetermined in the protocol; it depends on the rate of Bitcoin mining, and the number of Bitcoins that have been mined. Therefore, it doesn’t respond to the demand pressure in the same way as gold does. Considering that the price of each Bitcoin is P, and the supply of Bitcoins (which is fixed by the network protocol) is S, and the output of an economy is 0, then by the basic law of economics,
Price, P = Output, O/ Supply, S
This means that the price of Bitcoin will only act proportionally to the output of an economy. In simpler terms, the digital currency will truly reflect the growth of an economy."

 "It is the technology underlying the digital currency Bitcoin, a technology known simply as the blockchain. This technology platform is open and programmable and therefore holds the potential to unleash countless new applications -- of which Bitcoin is one -- and as-yet-unrealized capabilities that have the potential to transform everything in the next 25 years."
It's odd how many folks seem to separate the Blockchain from Bitcoin as if the Blockchain could exist w/o a reward system for keeping it decentralized.

When you re at home you connect to your wireless at home. When you re away from home you search for wireless (hotspots) with your phone and connect to ones you are authorized to use. I'm guessing people who want to be paid fees, authorize the service to be used through their Abra service. They get paid as a pass through when someone looking to use the service sends money with their Abra service. Very Uber-like as Lejitz so aptly put it. Guessing is the operative word.

"At the Future of Payments Forum at Payments International 2015 last week, a number of speakers addressed the benefits of the underlying blockchain technology used by Bitcoin and its ability to change the payments industry.
Neil Telford-Reed, Director of Technology Innovation at WorldPay said that he thinks cryptocurrencies are interesting but it is “blockchain as a technology that could change the world.” Speaking during a fireside chat with Bradley Howard, Head of Endava Labs and Head of Digital Media, Endava, Telford-Reed said he believes that the potential for blockchain to disrupt both payments and insurance industries could be extraordinary.
25 per cent of the audience at the payments forum on Friday said they own a Bitcoin and the other keynotes discussing how far technology has advanced prove that people are now more willing to try new things.  Mark Stevenson, author of ‘An Optimist’s Tour of the Future’ said there has been a billion fold increase in processing power since 1965 and with the testing of driverless cars, “we’ve gone from something impossible to something possible.”
Lasse Birk Olesen, Product Manager, Coinify said that bitcoin blockchain is a technology, and like any technology it intends to be around for a long time. According to Olesen, blockchain presents an opportunity to offer new services and products to bank customers.
When it comes to the state of the payments industry at the moment during his keynote, Telford-Reed said that when his mother was a child shop assistants knew who she was and would hand over the goods to be paid at a later date but this scenario of trust and recognition has since changed and “we are now having to use technology to put trust and identification back into payments,” he said.
According to James Governor, Co-founder, Redmonk, “software is eating the world,” and we are moving from systems of record to systems of engagement, with players such as ApplePay adopting an “embrace, extend and extinguish approach to business” and Amazon Payments, who he thinks has an even more aggressive approach than Apple. Governor believes that the banking industry should be terrified of challengers such as Facebook who have recently announced that users can send money to their friends using their Facebook Messenger app.
Luke Olbrich, Head of EMEA Core Payments, PayPal said that as more new payment providers enter the market, the more regulated they will become. “More and more payment providers will become regulated and if Bitcoin technology gets big enough it will become regulated also.”
Stevenson mentioned IBM’s proof of concept for ADEPT, and news last week that IBM is considering adopting the blockchain technology behind Bitcoin to create a digital cash and payment system for government and central banks. Stevenson said that blockchain’s technology is based on a network of trust, something which is lacking with third parties and he believes “trusted third parties will be replaced by networks of trust.”
Since IBM joined the race to adopt blockchain, Intel is reportedly also planning to investigate the potential of blockchain technology and the rest of the industry is waiting to see who will transform the payments landscape with blockchain technology first."

This idea does not seem outrageous to me, in fact it seems like a move to capture market share of the new de facto standard of currency Bitcoin by making an inferior version government promotes as backed by government there fore superior.
My guess is it will completely legitimize Bitcoin, and make it a competing Cryptocurrency with the new standard. This should ultimately bode well for Bitcoin in that it will be the one with guaranteed scarcity.
Sidechain coins will be pegged between the new currencies  giving Bitcoin legitimacy that can't be taken away.

The crux of the idea in layman's term:
"While this may sound complicated, essentially it works like this – If all bitcoin transactions are being discussed in an open forum, its public ledger, the lightning network allows parties to enter into a closed room for a period of time, conduct transactions during that period, and at the end of the agreed time, broadcast these transactions to the network"

Not to argue against your point, but to better understand. If IBM and the banks were to create a closed decentralized network (intranet) where they competed for the correct answer to a math problem, making all entrees transparent to the closed network. This would be as close as they could get to replicating the Bitcoin technology. Would this work? If not why?
I hate the idea of banks trying to beat Bitcoin using it's own technology against it, but want to know the risks.
One risk for certain is the failure of some banks like the one in 2008 creating a risk of a 51 pct attack against the network.
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:23:13
I understand your point, and understand why on a bitcoin thread this idea is not well accepted. Still there seems to be other dynamics that could come into play.

Furthermore, Bitcoinz USA is now offering Bitcoin for sale to consumers in Vietnam through the Vault 51 website.
Currently, the company's management team believes that Vietnam has the potential to become a huge catalyst for Bitcoin worldwide. To continue, "as an emerging growth market with aggressive technological advances, and a burgeoning population, Vault 51 in Vietnam provides a tremendous amount of growth potential not only for Vault 51 but the Bitcoin eco community in general"-JW Walker President Bitcoinz USA.
Vault 51 is an offline storage system for Bitcoin users, which is represented by a Physical Bitcoin. The electronic Bitcoin is then stored off-line in a secured computer chip known as Vault 51 and embedded in a Physical Bitcoin, which is not connected to the internet. This process is also known as cold storage and is done to avoid hacking, loss, or theft."

"But there is no direct correlation between less revenue to the miner -&gt; price adjusts to compensate."
I would say there is at least an indirect correlation. If the price does not go higher mining is less profitable and there will be less miners. If price goes up more miners can continue to mine profitably.

"Bitcoin’s money supply growth is programmed to slow down each year. For example, this year the BTC inflation rate will be 10 percent. Next year, the amount of BTC in circulation will increase by 9 percent. After the protocol halves the mining reward to 12.5 BTC in late 2016 or early 2017, it’s projected that the inflation rate will fall down drastically to 4 percent. In theory, since all of this is known before hand and programmed inside the bitcoin protocol, it should already be priced in. In practice, I’ve seen smaller less efficient altcoin markets rally after a ”Great Halving.”"
So the increase in bitcoin will be 10% this year and decrease to 4% two years from now, while hopefully increasing in popularity and use. It pleases me that folks don't realize the time to buy is now. If all goes well there's going to be an awakening followed by nice price increase.

Very well thought out prediction and the best reasoning I've heard for Govcoin's ultimate failure.
 
"The Govcoin will not work out because the whole point of being decentralized is that it allows there to be no weak point that hackers can attack. There is no central location that can be taken down; this is why Bitcoin is unhackable. A Govcoin will be easily hacked as a digital currency is the ultimate target for hackers. IBM working on this project alone will not be able to defeat Bitcoin because it is open-sourced. IBM may have a lot of smart programmers employed, but it can't beat the thousands working on Bitcoin."

    Intel will be hiring someone to do a similar project which will likely fail.
    The use of the blockchain might help Samsung and IBM create products in the "Internet of Things" category.
    Facebook's messenger payment system and Apple Pay will be disrupted by Bitcoin in the long run although they will succeed in the next few years.

It's a good question T0 was using the Bitcoin Blockchain (I believe) to start out with, NASDAQ is using a private blockchain for their pilot, so the way this post reads could be either. Both T0 and NASDAQ intend to use private blockchains eventually from what I've read.

Than what is the incentive? isn't it to be able to share files therefore the files are the incentive. Seems like a reward to me. Still a good point the blockchain could be set up so that the rewards are shared amongst the owners and no one else gets to participate. It would seem a closed network might present some other vulnerabilities a truly decentralised network does not have to worry about.

I wonder if the CEO of Bitreserve understood how damaging his statement was to the Bitcoin ecosystem of which they are part. It seems he should be one of the biggest advocates. He certainly lost my respect, and he seems to act like a spoiled teenager who speaks out badly against his parents.

No one mentions price stability here, which I guess is because it's going to be a long time before it happens.
All three answers have something interesting to say. Here is the top one.
“Retailers begin to notice that a significant number of consumers own bitcoin and worry that if they don’t accept the currency they will be at a competitive disadvantage to the retailers who do. This leads to mass adoption by retailers that are trying to avoid being left behind in the new cryptocurrency revolution.”

I have to agree with this article with clenched teeth. Still I believe one of the Sidechain coins spawned from Bitcoin or mass adoption so great it deemphasizes the volatility will help Bitcoin prevail.

This interview is great. I have a couple of questions. 1) Are sidechain coins always distributed/pegged on a 1 to 1 ratio to the underlying bitcoin, or can it be a some other consistent ratio, say 100 Sidechain coins to 1 bitcoin ? 2) Do Sidechain coins have there own Blockchain or do they always use Bitcoin's blockchain and proof of work system? I will email these if it's easier to collect questions that way. Thanks so much for your comment/post. Oh, and is there a youtube video of the original interview you can post for us to watch?

I will look for it in the future, didn't realize I'd sent folks to a crappy site. I will delete.

It would be a big win for Bitcoin if they do.
@_date: 2015-02-04 13:21:37
no I was thinking more of a coin that would throttle back mined coins or create more based on volitility.

"The startup further mentioned that there are currently over 20 integrations with its platform, and that it is collaborating with at least two other startups: Warranteer, which aims to digitize product warranties via the blockchain, and Bitt, which wants to bring “global financial access” to more than 200,000 unbanked people with a blockchain-based “Caribbean Dollar”."

Love this concept..... I will be looking more into this in future months.
@_date: 2015-02-20 06:33:50
It would be interesting to know if there is a cap on how many coins are minted and how closely the source code is tied to the Bitcoin open source code. Unless someone steps forward only time will tell.
@_date: 2015-02-05 00:00:59
Another clenched teeth statement.... This won't be done quickly by Sidechains because, as I understand it the first iteration of Sidecoins will be pegged to Bitcoin on a 1 to X ratio  still guessing this can be brilliantly overcome one day by one of the future coins. Bitcoin was built with scarcity in mind, so overcoming it is somewhat counter intuitive and would more easily be done by some other cryptocurrency

The original article mentions agnostic blockchain. 
"Despite his staunch support for the bitcoin network, Byrne was also keen to stress that tØ intends to be ledger agnostic, meaning it can work with any decentralized ledger, he said, with a few weeks of integration."
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:14:56
Great explanation on the economics of Bitcoin's scaling debate, and how it's played out over the last couple of years.
@_date: 2015-10-07 21:44:06
For most the scarcity will be there before they do anything about it. Buy now while it's still relatively cheap.

Of course it probably won't get read for all the down voting of anything that has to do with regulation, even if it spawns a self regulating thought. You should put your idea in a separate text post, I for one will certainly upvote it :)

Interesting article on the quantitative easing done by central banks. Related because as other currencies become inflated, Bitcoin should go up in price just to name one economic factor.

I'd say for fairness sake. The mother of all significant crytocurrencies should get her due.

Got upset with Coinbase for this and started using Circle.

I believe if Google uses Bitcoin as it's platform's currency for mobile and internet payments, Bitcoin will gain mass recognition.
@_date: 2016-07-10 04:49:33
I've heard a lot of speculation that the price would go down immediately after the halvening, because of all the folks who bought in for the short gains. I've got some money ready, should this happen. I'm thinking the price will stabilize in the six hundreds for a while and then progress upward, because of the constraints on new supply, but that's just my guess.

Yes the all might well be propaganda. Still an interesting read on their approach to mining. I can't believe they can offer a cloud mining approach that can offer sub $100 bitcoins.

Gotta love Seafile for standing up to big payment providers. Paypal has done their share of unscrupulous stuff, it's good to see them get put in their place. I'll be using Seafile's services in the future.

 is this good for Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:03:16
There is a correlation between Bitcoin price and all other cryptocurrency prices, therefore  imho they will dip too.

I went the route of mining when I first got into Bitcoin. It wasn't long before I realized I couldn't compete with those who were getting their electricity cheap, so I sold my miners for Bitcoin.

The return on investment would come from the combined hashrate that goes toward's Core's solution. I'll have to consider if I want to give up $714 plus shipping and cost of running - bitcoin return on investment.

The programming code would have to poll for price and decrease the number of coins rewarded when price was down and increase the number of coins when price was up.

"What will they do when the 21 millionth coin is mined?" By the time the 21 millionth coin is mined, miners will be built into computers as a method of paying for services on the Internet of things.
@_date: 2015-02-08 14:39:10
pretty scary if they can capture that kind of mining share.
@_date: 2017-06-04 15:18:16
There will only ever be 21 million Bitcoins. The more users that come to use them the less Bitcoins there are in proportion to their users. This will make the price go up which gives each Bitcoin greater buying power, hence the idea that they are deflationary.

When they did this, I immediately withdrew all of my holding on coinbase, and moved to circle, two days later they unfroze my account.
