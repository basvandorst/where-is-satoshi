It's on my to-do list, for sure!

Yeah, that’s my node. I’m in the process of moving some things around so it will be back online soon. Until then, I’m using OpenNode to handle payments (which is working well).

Yes, if you don’t want to share your existing email address then you shouldn’t sign up. I completely understand your concern.

Technically feasible? Yes, since Postfix is open source, it could be modified. But beyond that, the list of what's technically feasible is vast, and there's all kinds of scary things that people can do on the internet. I can tell you that I don't do anything bad, but I'd never ask you to trust me (because what would be the point, especially in the context of a subreddit that holds trustlessness as a core tenant?).
Ultimately, if you're concerned about unauthorized people reading your email, you should be using tools like [PGP]( and viewing messages in plaintext only. You should also run your own mail server and secure it to your personal standards.
[Trusted third parties are security holes]( and omg.lol is clearly a third party. It's good to be cautious. Only you can decide how much risk you're willing to accept when using any third party.

Great questions, and I'm happy to answer them.
The service runs the open source Postfix mail transfer agent, which is configured to forward mail for subscribed accounts (using the forwarding address provided), and to send all other mail to /dev/null (where it's immediately deleted). After a message is forwarded, it's deleted from the Postfix queue. Nothing is retained other than a simple log indicating that a message was received and where it was sent. Here's a sample log entry from an email I just sent (to testing which was forwarded to adam

I only keep this log for basic troubleshooting, and the log data is shared with account owners (you can see your own mail logs within the service). There's no content from the messages (like subject lines or message text) within the logs, only the minimum data showing that an email was successfully forwarded.
So to answer your second question: **no**, I can't read any emails. The server just forwards them on, purges them from the mail queue, and then waits for the next forwarding request. I put an incredibly high personal value on privacy, not only my own but everyone else's too (because I think we're all better off when things are private, including stuff that doesn't belong to me).
I hope this answers your questions, but let me know if you need any more detail or have any others!

Hey, thanks! I really appreciate that! :)
@_date: 2019-04-17 19:08:38
Thanks! Yes, TLS is coming (I wish there was something as simple as Let's Encrypt for email). The web page hosting is \*super\* basic right now, but I have incremental (weekly) feature additions in the works, with the first one rolling out tomorrow. Good stuff ahead!
@_date: 2019-04-05 05:27:21
Thanks! And yeah, as someone who works in that real business world and who pretty much works out of an email inbox all day long, I'm wondering how email is going to work for the younger folks who eventually enter the workforce. The concept of "checking email" is completely foreign to my kids. It's gonna be interesting, for sure.

Hah, that's embarrassing! I really appreciate you catching that, and I just fixed it (I was still setting a session cookie in a couple of scripts, left over from before my anti-cookie approach, even though no application data was being stored in those cookies). As part of my totally-just-now-made-up bug bounty program, I'll PM you with a gift code that you can use for an  address. :)
As for the nature of cookies, I totally agree with you. Cookies are great and they make life easier. I just really don't like all of the "This site uses cookies and you agree to letting us use them blah blah blah" plastered all over the web, and I don't want to be a part of that. I think the GDPR is great for consumers but I'd rather engineer my way around using cookies than have to make a big deal about using them, get consent, etc.

At the moment, everything is configured for forwarding only. In theory anyone could spoof an outbound email to make it look like it came from any address, but doing that with an omg.lol address could cause issues with the existing DKIM/SPF configuration.
That said, I'm exploring ways to support sending messages from omg.lol addresses. I'll be adding an updates page soon that will track the progress of in-progress stuff and requested features, so stay tuned.

Thanks! :)

Thanks, appreciate that! I just fixed it. :-)

Yeah, well said. And very succinct. :) You’re 100% correct: it does come down to trust. I don’t have any issue with people who don’t trust me, and paradoxically I actually sympathize with them. Bad for business, but I totally respect the sensitivity around email.
@_date: 2019-04-05 15:11:55
That’s totally fair. I’ve been burned more than a few times by companies that yank stuff out from under me (still especially bitter about Google Reader) so I understand where you’re coming from.
