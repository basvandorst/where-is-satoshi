I understand that a change would be necessary, but what would happen to Bitcoins? And would people really invest their money in another crypto-currency that could, without much warning, be made worthless, after seeing what happened with Bitcoins? I guess what I'm really trying to ask here is, if the cryptography behind bitcoins was broken, would people have enough trust to use another crypto-currency?

It releases a huge amount of personal information on a guy I don't like (home address of him and everybody in his family, pictures of his dick, all kinda neat shit) on several different sites and emails said info to several of my friends with instructions to continue spreading it as far and wide as they can.

It's not about it being money. You go to a casino, buy chips, gamble with those chips, then exchange however many chips you've got afterwards for money. That's still a casino, despite the fact that casino chips are not "money".

"I want to start a business and I need some money but I won't tell you what it is okay that sounds good to you right?"

But with cash, you've got at least *some* chance of getting your money back. I like your explanation though.

I think he just manually sent you the bitcoins.

Yeah, based on me making that personal trigger I'm actually going on to make it into a full project that I'm eventually going to release on GitHub. It'll have a control panel, a big custom event system, a nice calendar display of when the trigger should go off, etc etc. :D

But it's not like if you broke a bank's crypto, you would suddenly have all the money and nobody would be able to stop you like it'd be with BTC. From my understanding, if bitcoins' crypto was broken bitcoin wallets and bitcoins themselves could be taken by anybody with the tools to break the crypto, in this case, probably a quantum computer. With a bank or w/e else, since it's centralized, the powers at hand could just freeze everything until a neccessary change was made, then fix the issues themselves.
(Correct me if I'm wrong on my understanding of what'd happen if the crypto was broken, this is based off of my limited knowledge of how bitcoins and their keys and hashes and whatnot work.)

I solemnly swear if Humble Indie Bundle starts accepting bitcoins I'll pay them 2btc for the bundle

To extend upon what everybody else has said about recurring fees and making them hard to cancel: This also works in the site's benefit because nobody wants to go to their lawyer and say "HorseCum.com won't stop charging my credit card, help!"

You shouldn't need a TOS to tell you not to commit the crimes of defamation, libel, making threats, or harassment. Those are crimes on their own.

Yeah, I'm not going to lie about it to get them into bitcoins, I'm just trying to find a way to soften the blow, you know? Like, to someone who isn't super tech-savvy and typically uses PayPal, I can see how not being able to fix a mistake would be frustrating and a turn-off.

I made a digital dead man's trigger (which serves an entirely unrelated purpose) on my website a week or two ago. If I don't visit that page once a week (this could easily be changed to months or years) then it triggers something to happen. In your situation, you could make a similar contraption and have it say, email the key out to someone you trust.

Criminals will get domains either way, but with a currency that is semi-anonymous by design it makes it even easier.

It must've taken a lot of self control to not scam them simply for being such an idiot.

Shit, can you just imagine how great the people who bought at like $0.05 feel right now? They're $40.10 right now. They're worth fucking **802 times as much now as they were then.** That's crazy. If you put $1,000 into this back then, you would have **$802,000** right now.
Bitcoins are awesome.
@_date: 2013-02-19 00:26:11
Not really. They don't actually give a shit if you're 18 or not. It's just a legal thing, they sound more responsible if they do it this way.

Question to all:
Maybe I misunderstand this, but why does it matter if you pay with Bitcoins VS a payment method like PayPal? If buying and using a VPN is legal where you live, legality is not an issue. And the privacy offered by bitcoins is nullified by the fact that, unless you're using a second VPN under the VPN you just paid for with bitcoins, you're connecting to this VPN with your clearnet IP address. I mean, don't get me wrong, I think it's great that they're accepting Bitcoins, I just don't get what privacy bonus it adds.
@_date: 2013-02-15 20:20:53
I can sort of see why they don't accept bitcoins though. If you allow payment for domains in bitcoins, you basically allow a slew of criminals to get domains. I don't like the old "bitcoins is for criminals!" argument but in some cases, it's just begging for crime. Sites like  and  (might be down) are purchased anonymously already which is what allows them to have crime on them - bitcoins just make that easier.
@_date: 2013-02-18 03:44:46
Maybe I misunderstand, but can't a bank just change their crypto pretty easily? Not like, easily, but a lot easier than changing the entire way Bitcoins work. Maybe I'm just missing an obvious point here, I dunno.
