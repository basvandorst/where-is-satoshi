Another chump who thinks BTC is the only form of crypto currency. Sour Grapes...
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:35:38
Then don't invest? The thing about bitcoin is the people heavily against it try so hard to convince everyone else they're wrong.   
Why do you care? Let suckers be suckers if that's how you feel.

I don't know how anyone who says "don't invest more than you can afford to lose!" can't see that as funny?  
You literally said it yourself... Play stupid games, win stupid prizes.

Then it promptly dropped to $2000 amirite?

I can tell you're an old guy, probably going to pass aways soon, because you think you're time alive has prepared you for everything, and can't admit to being wrong.

Kifflom brother brother!
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:40:33
Love you :)

Looks like someone took an L recently. Yeah, it's actually funny.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:32:42
99% of crypto investors.

In this context, it's funny. If someone says "Hey give me money, I'll double it" and you give them money without doing any research, it's funny when you lose. There's another sucker born every minute.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:01:44
Ah yes people have literally only lost money in Crypto!  
You know so much, tell me more!
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:08:56
And that's fine too. Hold or don't, just do you. At least the day traders don't shit on people who hold, it's always the other way around. BTC, LTC, ETH all scams? Fantastic, don't put your money in them. Otherwise these people need to shut the fuck up and keep their day jobs.

Homelessness is strong with this commenter.
@_date: 2017-12-25 06:15:31
Fair enough.   
They should stop bitching about it on Reddit all the same.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:30:40
Yall buying at ATH deserve to lose every time. It's fucking hilarious.
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:55:47
No, people like you don't die of old age. They die because they think they know everything until they don't. Stay poor friendo. Don't invest. But why do you care if anyone else does? FUD for fun? or Gay for pay?

Nah, this entire sub is strictly tools. Bunch of people crying because it's "baby's first investment." If you can't take the dips you don't deserve the gains. Thanks for your comment though.

So you still lost $2000? I don't see your point? But keep buying high and selling low please.
