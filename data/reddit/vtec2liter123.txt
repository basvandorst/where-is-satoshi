Im aShibe all the way started with dogecoin only have dogecoin Im haveing so much fun its crazy. I love Bitcoin because we would not be here if it wasn't for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is revolutionary. I know that Dogecoin has been a great help to bitcoins image and rightly so. I cant speak for everyone but I would love to see Dogecoin Bitcoin and Litcoin all do a sponsorship of Josh! That would be the best.

My intention wasnt to moch, just to state a fact the craziness going on with bitcoin sucks and im sorry you all have to go threw it. But i just felt like going back to the fun and silliness. You all are going to get threw it, its growing pains and the sowing up of security flaws. If I a fended  anyone i apologize. There is a lot of emotions flying around and rightly so, sometimes you  need to take a step back and relax and have some fun. Remember we all are apart of this wonderful experiment and it has and will revolutionize the world. I  just had a failed attempt to lighten things up a little. I see to much panic and negativity flying around with bitcoin, Bitcoin is a powerhouse and is only as strong as the community that surrounds it. Much Love and Silliness! Much MooN?
