Because not everyone (including me) agrees with this idea, so raising the Block size will create a hard fork that will divide bitcoin into two coins and two communities. And later, when it is reduced again, another hard fork will take place. We might end up with three coins.

So if everyone had segwit, there would be no need to wait for 6 confirmations?

I'm using electrum. However, electrum creates bech32 segwit wallets. As far as I know, no other wallet or exchange supports this format. Is there at workaround, or should I go through the hoops to create a "legacy-style" segwit wallet?

Don't get me wrong, I don't support the guy. But this wallet is great.
- It has a consistent, easy-to-understand, modern UI
- It can set custom fees
- It warns you when one of your adresses has a lower balance than the transfer fee.
- It supports multisig.
- It has support for fingerprint on android
- It can show the value of your bitcoin in non-standard currencies, like SEK.
- It shows detailed information about the fees, like how much it will be in both BTC and your currency of preference. 
- It has options to customize your wallets with colors and names.
It's a very user-friendly wallet. The only thing it lacks is segwit support and not being backed by bitcoin.com. But no other wallet on android offers the same user-friendliness, which is important for newcoiners. This is the only wallet that looks like it has been designed by professionals. Try to convince a non-technical person to use electrum on android. It looks horrible, is slow, buggy and is not easy to understand. Before anyone accuses me of being a shill, know that I used to use this wallet because it's the one that looks most official on the app store when I was a newcoiner, but I recently stopped using it. I've tried all the wallets recommended on bitcoin.org. Breadwallet is the one that comes closest.
And in contrast to what people would like you to believe, this wallet doesn't push Bcash on you in any way. The app just supports both BTC and BCH.
I'm not shilling for the wallet, and I don't want anyone to use it and support bitcoin.com. But we should recognize that for bitcoin to take off, there should be work done to make newcomers to crypto feel at home, and right now, this wallet is doing it best.

Nice work! Could you also show how much the fee would equal in dollars?

It's also much more expensive to buy at coinbase in Europe because we have to buy in Euros.. is it possible to circumvent this somehow?

I have bitcoins in this wallet. Can someone recommend me a better one? And should I just transfer the bitcoins to the new wallet as a transaction?
