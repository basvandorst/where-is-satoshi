I synced one of my old wallets back during the 20k days and after 8 hrs (if I recall), I found that I had 6 Satoshi in it.. wooot!

Just so you're aware, GDAX is owned and operated by Coinbase

gdammit.. why wasn't that posted 2 days earlier, ugh :(
@_date: 2014-11-25 15:09:25
Ah right, I may be mistaken

You listed the two downsides of a BTC transaction without escrow. :(
@_date: 2014-01-02 21:36:58
They only take payment in BTC and LTC. Time to try to track someone down and get the word out!
@_date: 2014-01-01 09:19:37
I read everything here, but I missed why you sued them? Also by BFL I assume you mean Butterfly Labs? 
I've purchased from them and I got what I ordered and the devices work as expected.

Interestingly enough it seems nearly impossible to report someone for fraud on Google Analytics. I have yet to find any contact or forms to utilize.

Didn't see that excellent deal on the PS4, wow!! j/k also not what I bought, since I have one already.

True, FB can and will do whatever they like with posts. I'm mainly commenting about the legality and the suit.

So youre bagging on bitcoin or me here? I've made thousands on BTC already so who's the dumb one here? Have your chuckle, this post is here to help others learn from my mistake.
@_date: 2014-01-01 19:32:00
Yeah I suppose I have been with BFL. I only purchased from them when they had the items in-stock; I definitely stayed away from pre-ordering. All but two of my BFL devices were purchased via ebay for a decent price. I hope you get your money / coins back!

Good luck to them, you're protected by the 1st amendment (assuming you're in the USA). tl;dr A form of speech protected by the First Amendment as a "distorted imitation" of an original work for the purpose of commenting on it.

EDIT: Also, not only is this legal, the content is TRUE!

I have instant-buy on coinbase; I confirm.

100% illegal for a state to do this, good luck Texas; you're gonna need it. 
@_date: 2015-03-05 18:30:23
Don't mention that Taiwan is not part of China either.. aw snap..
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:20:47
What kind of ad services are supported when the app connection originates from China? I'd love to offer my paid apps if I could recoup the cost of allowing a direct download of the apk.

Not to be the barer of bad-news or to state the obvious, but you can consider your coins gone. I stopped trusting these "other" crypto-coin outlets after I lost 4 BTC and that was when it was only $900 a coin after the first bubble.
