I might be run out of this thread for saying so, but your potential for gains is much greater with altcoins if you're only working with a few hundred dollars.
@_date: 2018-01-03 04:25:00
Yup. Higher risks, higher rewards.
@_date: 2018-01-19 18:10:58
Yup, they are absolutely swamped with new customers and issues, expect them to be exceedingly difficult to reach. But they are one of the few, if only, vendors that are FDIC insured.

But this could also be its downfall. If they aren't able to fix transaction times (they've been better in recent days), BTC might not even have function as a day-to-day currency. I really do see it more as a store of value in the crypto world. I'm hoping it becomes adoptable on a large scale, however.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:42:50
One thing I'm wondering is that a lot of exchanges seem to temporarily go down during large increases or crashes. So say bitcoin is crashing but you can still sell at 10k, but the website isn't running, then you're fucked until service resumes. By that time it could be too late
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:39:03
Put in $700 on October when it was at 4K. I'd previously invested a few years Ago but sold when it dropped back to 300 and I needed money. Wish i put in more last October, but also don't because this looks too good to be true.

Cmon man, the dank buds were worth it. 
(I made the same mistake)
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:10:35
That really doesn't matter if there's not a consensus to change. That still doesn't make it bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-08 02:20:18
"Eye\-koze" ffs Gates at least pronounce ICO properly and pretend like you know what you're saying.
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:39:03
No, why are you pro BCH.
@_date: 2018-05-03 18:05:44
Why would he get banned? I simply wanted to know his viewpoint on BCH and why he supports it. I'm trying to start a conversation to understand it better.
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:09:02
Yea, this type of discussion basically fuels the surreptitious discussion of "is bitcoin cash the same as bitcoin?" It's obviously not, and asking that question in the first place is missing the real issues entirely.
@_date: 2014-04-13 17:52:27
I have a question because I'm only a lurker on here and own very little bitcoin. But how do these machines work exactly? Do you withdraw money, or withdraw bitcoin onto some type of card? Do you just type in your wallet address? How do you confirm it?
I truly and honestly don't understand what these do.
@_date: 2018-05-03 17:12:10
I mean this honestly and sincerely: Why?
@_date: 2014-06-10 00:40:10
You know what, you're totally right. I forgot to provide a credit card! Ah, thank you sir. It's tough to keep up with all the limitations on these sites sometimes.
@_date: 2018-05-04 03:16:59


Amen, brother.
@_date: 2018-05-03 20:14:01
Honestly man, I didn't realize I was in r/bitcoin, I thought I was replying to a post from cryptomarkets. So firstly, I was kind of surprised that anyone was in favor of Bcash, and I was also interested to know why they are actually in favor of Bcash. I'm open to listening to people, and I wanted to learn more, but yea r/bitcoin is probably not the best platform for that discussion \(though I think there should be open discussion about it, because it's important\). I'm a pretty decidedly anti\-Bcash person, but I also have $0 invested in bitcoin at the moment. The best choice between the two seems obvious to me, but I like to keep an open mind about it.
@_date: 2014-10-05 19:35:20
Yes. Say, for instance, a Midi controller costs $150. I buy $120 worth of bitcoin while it's low. The price of bitcoin rises, and now I have $150 of bitcoin. I can now buy the Midi controller.

@_date: 2018-05-03 18:35:47
Oh shit, I'm sorry I actually thought I was on a different sub! My bad.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:42:01
I'm hoping to buy, wait a week or two for it to raise, then use those funds to buy household objects by spending less when bitcoin is low. Then, when it goes up, I can purchase from Overstock or other sites while it's high. Savings, basically.
edit: I also look for electronic equipment so saving on that can be *huge*
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:40:34
If you sell bitcoin, does it dispense one's local currency? Or is this for digital transactions only, i.e. you still have to find a business that accepts bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:33:42
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:33:36
I guess I was just asking if there were any projections of it rising. I'm not a big spender, I just like to buy shit off overstock and what not.
@_date: 2014-05-06 01:41:23
I've never felt so ashamed to own bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:03:21
Should I seriously buy right now? What if it keeps dropping? I just bought at 380 and 336 the other day and come on today and it's near 250. Are there any expectations it will be back somewhere around 350 soon?
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:30:20
Do you basically have to have a smart phone in order to pay with bitcoin at stores like this? 
@_date: 2014-05-06 03:15:34
Or the ill-fated failcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-17 22:29:51
I've seen zero freaking out on the dark net forums. Perhaps this person doesn't know what they're talking about whatsoever.
@_date: 2014-10-06 17:53:12
Indeed. I keep it in low amounts, generally under $200. I just like to follow it and keep up on news and whatnot, but I don't have the money or resources for being a true investor. If bitcoin were to skyrocket to 10k or something, I'd probably completely miss it with my luck.
@_date: 2015-01-17 22:31:19
For small vendors, yes. But I'm fairly certain the large ones are laundering the money through a legitimate business. These are huge operations going on and most of them aren't stupid.
@_date: 2014-06-09 06:40:56
Cool, will check this out.
@_date: 2018-06-06 06:14:13
It's almost like a psychological study in bias. It's frightening how many people will trust a headline simply because it's a headline. And then we wonder why there's a war on media.
Hint: It's because you didn't verify the information you were given. Some news sources are shitty, others are good. Make your own conclusions.
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:57:47


Patently untrue. There are many news organizations that have the utmost accountability; in fact, their entire organization is based on truth and verified claims (AP, Reuters, Bloomberg). 
It's that type of mentality that's going to keep us in the dark ages. The press is the Fourth Estate of democracy, and we should respect it as such. That doesn't mean you have to universally agree with all news organizations, but there are many who actually operate in a fact-based world and you shouldn't just eschew them because you think all news is "shitty."
edit: by the way, it's kind of funny I ran into you on this subreddit as well. 
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:22:23


Amen to that.
and: [this conversation](
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:03:45
No, I meant thank you for removing a post that had no article associated with the headline. And also for restoring it.
@_date: 2018-06-06 14:34:49
Thank you.
@_date: 2018-06-06 15:12:39
No, I'm appealing to the formative standard that OP shouldn't post a headline without substantive evidence. It's not about authority, it's about integrity.
@_date: 2018-06-06 04:47:19
What the fuck is this? It's not even a link to a news article, it's just an arbitrary image. I'm downvoting out of principle, not message. The crypto community is already misleading enough, we don't need random headlines with no facts or content.

It's only in its fourth episode, ffs. I wouldn't be surprised if this was introduced into the story later.

It's gotta be a mental health issue of some sort, which consequently makes him a huge troll. You don't sit in front of congress with a shit-eating grin while scoffing at them unless you have some type of personality disorder. The article says towards the end:


How the hell did he just turn himself into the victim when he's made his money from price gouging life-saving medicines? It's unbelievable.
@_date: 2016-02-15 18:05:52
Didn't think so. Unless Nakamoto uses his influence or something to trace down the market and hold someone accountable? That doesn't make any fucking sense either. Secondly, why would Nakamoto even bother? Shkreli angers me beyond all comprehension.
@_date: 2016-02-14 14:18:18
Holy shit I hope this is true. [This is hilarious]( if it actually happened and he deserves this type of punishment and much, much worse.
@_date: 2016-02-15 18:18:52
It's from the Guardian, one of the most reliable papers on the planet. Furthermore, it's a quote from Shkreli. I was asking about the plausibility of it, which I figured was zero but still wanted to ask.

Hey at least he was nice enough to wait two years /s

Same with all the other crashes/corrections AS they were happening.

The Coens are fantastic at drama as well as comedy. There's little humor in *Blood Simple* and *No Country for Old Men*, for example. You really couldn't ask for a better filmmakers to tell a story, and quite frankly Ross *didn't* know what he was doing entirely and made a bunch of a very stupid mistakes.
@_date: 2016-10-16 14:57:45
Joel Cohen is one of four writers credited for that script. It's possible they wrote and developed it during group sessions, but far more likely it was one of those horrible scripts that was passed from screenwriter to screenwriter until the studio execs were satisfied with a slightly less shitty final draft. That happens A LOT in Hollywood, often resulting in little to no credit for the original writer. By that time the studio has already purchased the rights to the script so they can do whatever they want with it. At least the original writer gets paid for selling those rights, whereas the second writer brought on may rework the script for six months only to be told that the studio is going in a different direction with *another* writer who will inevitably steal the ideas from the  two previous screenwriters, and will be the only one to see his or her name in the credits. It's a bullshit, cutthroat industry a lot of the time.
@_date: 2016-10-15 13:35:17
It's Coen, guys. The Cohen brothers wrote *Garfield*. 
@_date: 2015-03-18 15:24:29
The charges for murder were dropped because they were determined as entrapment by a police officer. You can easily find this story online. The other aspect is the Ross could possibly be a scapegoat for several other people going under the name "DreadPirateRoberts" as implied by the name itself, which is from the Princess Bride. There's a lot of interesting things to the story. It's one of the most fascinating, I think, in recent memory. Expect a movie to be made of it.

I'd suggest Circle or Coinbase.
