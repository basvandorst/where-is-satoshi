Bit desperate here. Not getting help anywhere else.
Have some fiat petrodollars and want to invest in cryptocurrencies such as BTC (BTC proper not BTrash endorsed by hufpo tentacle of the n W o for centralization) and mainly a bunch of alt-coins.
1: What is a good exchange site or sites, if multiple are needed as some do a two-site process, to sign up for that offer a great amount of anonymity, wide range of payment options and coins available, security, fast transaction times, and friendly intuitive user interfaces. L-I-V-I-N (or trying to) in the fasco-communist U.S.S.A still, if that means anything, without a VPN/proxy at the moment.
2: What is a good VPN/proxy combo, if needed? (For ex: HMA vs. Vshield vs. others) Tails? How does T O R work? Had a friend who was into this stuff and saw some markets and other functions of such years ago but haven't seen or spoken to that person in almost two years. Read a redit post or two dated from years ago about ripping out hard drives and finding a LinuxOS computer and using other wi-fis and opening browsers while not connected to the internet, is any of this still necessary or have there been improvements since? Eli5 this semi-newb longtime lurker.
3: What are/is a good hard cryptocurrency wallet(s)? (For ex: Trezr vs. Ledgr vs. others) Not all coins this user is interested in are currently shown to be covered by either of these two main wallets, so if they are added later, will it be through a patch via software or will this user need to buy a new hard wallet (trying to avoid planned obsolescence here)? Eli5 the pros and cons of each iteration of each of these wallet companies please.
Here are the coins this user is interested in HODLing in no particular order of favor or importance: D A S H, M o n e r o, N E O (read something about accumulating G A S with it, what is this process?), V e r t, V e r g e, C a r d a n o/A D A, L T C, and B T C proper, to name a few.
Bonus question: Looking to buy a new computer soon, recommendations with such questions/activities in mind? Laptop vs. desktop? Retailer vs. build-own? Any particular parts or functions if building own or looking in stores to watch out for and why?
Thanks for reading. If anyone can create a comprehensive "roadmap" for this user that's greatly appreciated.
BECAUSE THERE'S A WAHR ON FOR YUH MIND! PEACE, LUV, AND ANRCHY!
