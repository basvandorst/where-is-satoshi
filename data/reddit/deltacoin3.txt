Sigh. And that's why most people don't use Copay. What I'm asking doesn't break anything. You don't listen to what people want. And here I go open a Bitgo account. 
Edit: Ok so I created a Copay wallet, is very nice, I still want that feature tho.

I don't think you understand my request. I'd like to have 2 keys and another person only one key. But I don't want to run on two devices and don't care if both my keys are on the same because I allow myself to transact without the other person. But I don't want the other person to transact without my approval. 
This is a very common scenario

So that the other person can initiate transactions too. 
Say I'm the business owner and the other person is my manager, I want them to initiate transactions to pay bills, but I want to approve. But under the same wallet I want to be able to initiate transactions and also sign them without my manager. 
This is an extremely common scenario many others I know have.

You could do it as the other key is encrypted with a different password. Then when I do 2 of 3, I can transact myself or my partner can ask me to sign something but cant transact herself.

That's a very scandalous title. Looking at your account it seems you have all kinds of illegal shenanigans. Maybe they are just covering their asses.
I initially had my refused for missing information. Then added the missing email to a new request and had my funds sent to my new Copay wallet with no issues. 
You can just send a new request.

How does the RBF detection work?

Very cool, can I use it with my Ledger multisig wallet? 
@_date: 2014-10-07 18:30:27
Yes, on iOS. The app is not giving me a choice.
Why the Downvote??

What a stupid wallet, I loved their directory but after updating the app, this wallet took over the "bitcoin:" link types I had to **uninstall the app completely.**

Tor doesn't handle traffic like this well yet.

Does it [work with Coinkite Multisig like the Nano?](

Until you are flagged and they lock you out.

No traction and with 12+ staff, they are just trying to buy another 8 months of runway.
There are many better alternatives, these ppl can't even pick a decent name.

Cool! but with so many option (Copay,Coinkite,GreenAddress), I wish was not Coinbase. 
They have a terrible track record with privacy.

That's the issue I had with some of the other options, I hate linking my bitcoins to my real information.
