The goal is that when big payment processors start using Lightning, there will be much more block space and blockchain fees will drop.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:28:31
Yes it is. Hibernating stores the memory state to a disk and completely powers off, and it reloads it back to how you were using it when it comes back on. Sleep is a different story. Sleep is power on but just enough to keep memory, but hibernating is completely off.
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:10:45
Yes, I've done this multiple times. You move all your pre-fork bitcoins to new addresses before trying to access forked coins. It was also a great opportunity to move my cold storage bitcoins to Segwit addresses :)

In the current state, if ~10% of nodes went offline, then chances are that your node isn't going to be able to find a route to pay another node. But if all nodes opened a second channel with another random node, it vastly improves the mesh interconnection and vastly increases the tolerance of nodes going offline. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:06:24
Yes is it "really off." The power supply stops supplying power until the power button is pushed to turn it back on. No components are functional in the off (or hibernating) state.

Aaaand it's gone. It's all gone.
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:47:27
I was also about to make a post about this. If you have the ability to enter your own fees, look at  and estimate them yourself! You could cut a 1000sat/b fee to 500 sat/b and still be estimated to be confirmed within the hour.

I've found this to be the most informative and best explanation of what exactly happens and why it can solve scaling. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:40:11
...which is still pretty bad to be honest.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:42:25
Yes, spot on. This is needed. We can't stay at 1MB forerever, and even with full segwit adoption it looks like it still wouldn't be enough to sustain the massive growth. I believe in Lightning network to do its thing but it's not here yet and it still might need some increase to handle the opening and closing of channels with the backlog we have right now. 4MB wouldn't hurt anything. And the longer we wait the more people are going to lose faith in the developers to keep the system sustainable. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:41:07
If it's not needed now with ~$30 fees, 280K unconfirmed TX, and confidence levels dropping lower every day, at what point do you think would necessitate it?
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:41:06
Bitcoin will have to dip down to ~$1000 before I would actually lose anything I've put into it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:52:10
Weren't they using BitPay and exchanging for USD immediately? And only after the transaction is confirmed? Why would the price volatility have any effect on Steam's acceptance? As well as the fee being voluntarily decided by the user? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:19:34
Absolutely not. There is nothing logical about percentage based fees. You pay for how much space you take in a block and nothing more.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:03:04
I can guarantee you that there will still be plenty of miners even when the total block reward + fees is 0.005 BTC. The security of the system is not dependent on having a million asic miners and jacking up the difficulty. 
@_date: 2018-05-01 02:31:05
Pretty sure it had to do with Bitcoin Core version 0.16 coming out and using Segwit by default.
@_date: 2017-02-24 00:17:33
Those are the existing sell orders. Meaning when the price hits that point people will sell. It makes it harder to push the price past that point when there's so much at one price.
@_date: 2017-02-22 15:10:18
Fees are paid by the sender. Although they can deduct the fee from the sent amount, they have chosen not to, like most businesses.
@_date: 2017-02-22 04:47:46
Yep I quit trying to play the market today. Wasn't in it very long before I decided it wasn't worth it. I'd have more coins if I just held. There was only one time where I made a significant amount on a good trade and that was at [this predictable oscillation after this dip.](
@_date: 2017-02-22 15:00:55
Because of the competitiveness of mining, the difficulty level is astronomically high compared to where is was some years ago. Even the dedicated USB mining hardware I had a few years ago us completely obsolete. It's no longer viable to get anything out of mining with old PCs or even good GPUs anymore. The power cost will greatly exceed what you'll get out of it with today's difficulty.
@_date: 2017-03-31 19:23:00
If nodes didn't have the full chain, then who would have it? There is no central computer. The nodes ARE the record-keeping network for the chain. Nodes download the blockchain history from other nodes.
Mining is a competitive process to having a computer solve a problem. The difficulty is adjusted to where solutions are found at a relatively constant rate. As computers and the ASICs used to mine get faster and more prevalent, the difficulty rises to make it take more time to solve.

Other jobs. We still have massive amounts of skilled job vacancies. Until then its a really lame excuse for "give me free money now because I don't want to develop any needed skills."

What typically happens in an economic collapse is hyperinflation. Bitcoin/gold/stuff that holds its value relative to dollars will be useful to mitigate against that.

I donated some coins to the Libertarian Party of Venezuela or something like that which used them to get supplies for people, I believe.
@_date: 2017-08-30 06:54:32
Well perhaps not party, but some organization that connected with libertarians and accepted bitcoin donations to help people over there.

Because of the limited space, miners will choose based on fee per byte. If your transaction uses more data in the block then it'll be more expensive to be confirmed quickly.
@_date: 2019-06-21 23:34:43
Aaaand it's gone
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:44:30
Only if you're trying to guarantee yourself in the next block, which shouldn't be necessary in most cases. And if your wallet won't let you set your own fee, you need a different wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:20:01
If you're using services from US servers, it could potentially. But I believe this is not as big of a deal as people make it and there probably won't be any noticeable effect. People only argue things that *could* happen but if an ISP makes their service overly restrictive then they'll have a lot of backlash and hurt themselves so it isn't likely.
@_date: 2017-11-15 15:20:45
The blockchain is the same before the split but after it is completely different so I don't think it's as simple as copying it. For the purposes of converting forked coins it's probably much easier and faster to use a wallet that won't download the whole blockchain. I used Electron Cash. Ensure you move the BTC to a different address for privacy and security before you sweep your BCH coins into an BCH wallet. In the Bitcoin Core console you use "dumpprivkey [address]" to get the private key out of your core wallet for each address that has BCH which you can import/sweep into a BCH wallet. From there you can send the BCH to an exchange (I used HitBTC) to exchange for BTC.

It's risky. It's difficult to predict exactly when it's going to happen. I tried doing this with a small amount and I just ended up losing money trying to time it. It's on an upward trend so this is why just hodling is less risky and much easier to do.

And confirmed not more than a couple more hours after you posted. Confirmed within a day for a quarter. Fees are not bad and they're getting better.

The supply of Bitcoin is always defined. It may be more difficult to mine but there is still the same amount of coins generated according to the schedule. The price changes that occur are demand-based. AKA the user activity and user interest.

The cost of running a node? Just a computer, some disk space, and a network connection. Didn't cost me anything with what I already had.

Not so much the deregulation as it is the banks that gamble not being allowed to fail.

0.16 gives much better Segwit support. Having to use the console to generate segwit addresses was tedious for many and thus not utilized. The release of this version will likely increase Segwit usage which will help maintain the currently low fees.
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:23:35
"By decree" meaning a government has dictated that something not of value (paper) is to be given a specific value (dollar). Bitcoin has value because demand gives it value. It's value is genuine and NOT by decree. Therefore, bitcoin is not fiat. It is a commodity of value.
@_date: 2017-09-02 12:22:06
It's a string of text that is attached to a certain public address. It certifies you to spend the bitcoins associated with that address. If someone gets ahold of it, they can spend the bitcoins in an address. If you lose it, it's impossible to spend the bitcoins in an address, so it is very important to keep backups and keep them private. In Bitcoin Core they are stored in the wallet.dat file.

When looking at the blockchain.info transaction scroll through, most of them have a very large amount of inputs being consolidated into one output. It's not spam, just very heavy users deciding that now is a good time to consolidate. That's what seemed to happen when the mempool spiked briefly earlier this week. It'll pass.
@_date: 2018-02-03 20:12:07
Lightning is the game changer. It'll make most alts obsolete so their capital will likely move over to bitcoin, as well as real-world usability will open it up to consideration for many more people. I told myself I wouldn't buy anymore but I did because we have nowhere to go but up.

Blockchain is the trustless infrastructure. In many merchant cases, the ability to have instant authorization is a bigger priority for ease of use by customers while trusting a third party than to have trustless payment. 
Also why Lightning is important, so we can have the ability to trustlessly pay instantly so we don't need to sacrifice trustlessness to have instant authorization.

To "invest" in bitcoin is typically referring to purchasing bitcoins and holding them with hope its value will increase. Bitcoin is about freedom, there is no age you have to be to have them. Although some exchanges may place limitations on who can have an exchange account, to hold bitcoin from whatever source you purchase them from is free to anyone.

Constitutionally, as president of the National Assembly he is the one that assumes the presidency in the absence of a legitimate election.

Only once was I tempted, when it hit $19K and the total of my worth hit a significant benchmark. Had I listened to my gut I could have benefitted immensely but you always have that thought in your head "What if it keep rising?" since with a run like that you never really know when it'll stop.
To this day I still have never sold any bitcoin back into dollars.
