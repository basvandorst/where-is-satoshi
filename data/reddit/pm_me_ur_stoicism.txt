It's recommending that I make the fee ~$12 but I made it something like ~$2.30... I might be really fucked.

This whole discussion depends on how much was in your savings and how much money meant to you at that time. If it was a couple hundred dollars and you weren't close to broke then yes I agree.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:40:10
huh? Nobody mentioned $5k. And anyways, so what? The majority of the planet doesn't have $5k in savings
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:16:44
I saw that and thought about posting it myself. Nice work

Fucking seriously? christ...

Your actually be a dumbass if you put all your savings into some new tech without any proof behind.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:40:39
I never said Your actually be a dumbass?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:57:03
Wait, why? I don't understand why two people have called me a dumbass
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:54:36
Why do dogs deserve any lesser  than a human?
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:05:22
You act as if it's impossible. Wrong mindset friendo
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:51:14
Are you seriously calling people who have the mentality that you should save an animal from euthanasia instead of breed them for pleasure brainwashed cunts?

A puppy forced into this world for the sole reason to be exchanged for $$$. How great...
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:38:36
Can someone tell me why there are so many people in line? What is there country's current climate that makes this picture reality?
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:56:28
I expected this answer and you're right. But for the average joe in 2011, I'd say it was almost entirely a gamble.

And lucky, don't forget. Millions of people play different kinds of lotteries and lose, bitcoin happened to be a winner. For now, at least.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:44:39
? I don't understand
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:47:30
"looks like garbage"
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:23:00
Uh, what? did you photoshop that or something?
It's different on my screen
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:12:11
Because I only ever see men talk about it
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:49:48
Don't buy bitcoin if you can't do simple math
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:30:55
Funniest one yet!
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:06:01
Baby I got $33 in bitcoin now, all the way up from $23! YEEEEHHHHH
