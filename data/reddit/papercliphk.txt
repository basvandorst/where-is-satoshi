(DRINKS INCLUDED)
The Blockchain describes the new disruptive technology at the heart of Bitcoin which has the potential to disrupt more business as usual in a number of areas including corporate governance, legal contracts, accounting to having your house know when your home and open the door for you- the countless opportunities are only just being explored now. Blockchain technology makes it possible for humans, machines, real world devices (Internet of things) to talk to each other in a completely secure, trustless and decentralised manner- even in the absence of an internet connection (mesh networks). Applications can act, operate and 'think' entirely autonomously on the blockchain without human intervention- an area being explored by a number of projects right now.

Paperclip's keen to blow the cover on Bitcoin at our Big on Bitcoin event on May 29th. Hong Kong is fast becoming the Bitcoin hub for startups and we believe it's because bitcoin falls into one of HK's global competitive advantages, which is Finance and Financial products.
