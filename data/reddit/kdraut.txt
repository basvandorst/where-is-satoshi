i asked a question, i got a answer then i preceded to ask questions about submitting my id for verification which is when i got no response. the question was on the same topic of getting my account in good standing. Thats when i got frustrated because never in my life of speaking to a support agent via chat have this ever happened. No message was shown to me to say if he existed the chat i was just sitting there looking at it waiting for a response.

The issue was me waiting 5 fucking days. As a consumer i have options if i would of knew ahead of time about this bs i wouldnt have joined the site. Whatever reason they canceled the order they could of contacted in the waiting period to let me know. Then for me to contact support ask a question and when i respond i get no response because the ass wipe ended the trip its an issue. I only came to reddit to share my experience thats all, and for all the lames talking about i joined 0 hours ago wtf thats suppose to mean? I made the account to write the fucking post....

I thought it worked how it was advertise. I have no problem waiting but that bs turned a 5 days wait to 12 days wait.

I know how ach works, and i know they add the additional days to make sure my order is correct. The money was taken out the first 2 days. Now its been 4 since they said they refunded me and i still dont see my money in my account. This is why i have the right to be angry.
