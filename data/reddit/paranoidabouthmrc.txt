I came across this article the other day when I was trying to find out about tax information on spending bitcoin.  
Interesting strategy, especially as I believe that you are not liable for tax if you spend but you are if you cash out (although I'm still checking that one)

Are you sure that is tax evasion/money laundering?
Advice from my UK accountant says this is fine, but he knows very very little about bitcoin, so its definately not gospel.

Can someone explain to me what the "vault" in Coinbase is for and how it works?

Ah, the advice is based on bitcoin which is earned (some of my work gets paid in btc), rather than bought.  Perhaps that is the difference.

" as a foreigner, I can go visit the United States with no problem"
Erm, I dont think thats generally the case.

Whats the tax situation on using btc?
I'm in the UK and I understand that I am liable for capital gains tax if I sell bitcoin, but I havent been declaring it when I use it...like to buy flights etc.
Should I?

As to following the law, my income is so low that is below the income tax threshold, so there is no advantage to not declaring it.  However, I am concerned that if I dont declare it, they will question how I am managing to live with zero income, but if I do, then they may question how I got the money.
I have been paid in Euros before, but there was a paper trail.  The is no paper trail really for my btc other than the blockchain.  I didnt get a "receipt" when I converted it into cash, and I'd really not reveal my btc addresses to HMRC.
I have a feeling that my accountant (who already despairs at my shoddy book-keeping) is going to throw a hissy fit when he hears about this.
