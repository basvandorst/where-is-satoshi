Nah I am not agains BFL or againt anyone who supports BFL. you agreed its a game. In poker you bluff and by chance you win. or you have higher cards than the others and you win. My question is, how sure are you BFL is not bluffing? in fact, BFL didn't say this is a project funded by our money which can succeed or also fail. instead they pretended as its ready to produce.
Risk tolerance! perhaps you should be more realistic and recognize the risk and the inconsistency in BFL's announcements!

I dont know, most probably they will convert the price back to current BTC value and give it to you. which means you've LOST your bitcoins. I am affright!

yes truth is bitter sometime. Think about this! what do I gain from accusing someone for nothing? I have trusted them and invested. INVESTED MEANS I have invested in a technology they have pretended as it is ready. Not in a poker game to risk win or lose like the other commenter said. 
Moreover I am not saying they are scamming or about to go bankrupt. As an investor and after all this pitfalls with delivery slots it made me think like that! I am not judging someone by their past or by their hair color but certainly, i am interested whats going on with BFL and my money.
BFL could have allowed this comment and explained I was wrong or added more information to prove their customers will get their product. how many of us asking for picture of packaging?? (since they said product is in packaging stage). Instead they just ignored. which made me think they are hiding something. i think its normal??

yea.. thats another scary stuff. they never email you back when it comes to refund :(. I seriously regret i should have bought coins this January and trippled that money

BFL never released what is happening in their. instead they followed this:

another BFL member? wow you must be joking. I don't have any intention to give any false information and waste my time to do so. there are reasons! there are facts. just because you support BFL in forums does not means they give you free ASIC product. If you have preordered 4x ASIC product from BFL and paid them all completely and seen bitcoin from raised 7 to $40 you will understand the pain of loosing money.  A NORMAL PERSON WILL THINK ABT IT!

Thank you for the information. Since BFL is ignoring refunding emails your post is very helpful.

I seriously advice to use google. 
here what i've found:
if you are clever you will find two more links which leads to another forum talk where BFL employee confirms it!!!!.
if you still want to be stubborn be it..

did believe them too until february i was patient. after February it changed when they said ( we're about to send out, packaging now) and then suddenly extended to April.  Then it made me think when you have a product ready to ship out it must be working right? then suddenly bfl says chips haven't arrived yet or @ bumping. i was like, wait you said about shipping the product now saying chips haven't arrived yet. you know what i mean?
@_date: 2013-03-10 14:01:28
WOW... thanks for the link.. this actually should be posted everywhere and make most of asic investors aware of it..
@_date: 2013-03-10 14:09:06
haha true said 
@_date: 2013-03-09 14:52:11
perfect this is what I am talking about.. just imagine 4x $1200. if i would have invested that money buying coins im now $$ man. its obvious BFL is playing. they always says one more month so people think ok its just one more month. and got fooled!
@_date: 2013-03-10 10:08:50
when I ask you why did you lie, why do say because others lied thats why i lied... fact is you lied.. just admit it.
you don't care about development methodologies but the hash? you are tying to get juice without fruit. just hope they will get the fruit one day and will make juice for you.
Don't expect me to read entire 4000+ forum for my answers. I have personal life unlike some retired investors. BFL didn't allow this comment why would they call their customers stupid talk down to them where they are tying to sell? where is polite and manners and where is diplomatic behavior? as a client i have reasons to be frustrated after all this pitfalls. not the company mate. 
@_date: 2013-03-09 13:57:18
Probably BFL members are down voting this. Fact is that there are topics about BFL COO was imprisoned for scamming. If you are a BFL customer and down voting this topic. Comment here why you have down voted and i would like to know how sure you are that BFL is not playing?  
@_date: 2013-03-09 21:32:04
I am pretty sure, most of the BFL investors must be feeling like "holding a Tiger by the tail" ;) ;) 
@_date: 2013-03-09 14:00:19
haha ;). im just thinking i should have bought bitcoins with that money and sold it at higher price. or even getting interest from bank. damn BFL
@_date: 2013-03-10 10:00:45
So basically BFL is not actual manufacturer? Something very new to me. can you post the link also here?
well everyone else expect me to read the entire forum. I have personal life where I work mon-fri and weekend I'm spending with family and other things. Have no time to dig a forum with more than 4000+ entries to get to know that the company I have invested aren't an actual manufacturer but whole seller/reseller/marketing people.

WOW... thanks for the link.. this actually should be posted everywhere and make most of asic investors aware of it..

;) thank you for your concern. lets be honest. did you also pre-order anything from them? lets say you get delivered end of December maybe mining dificulties increased or BPB dropped to 25. won't you think you should have invested that money in BTC rather than waited so long? 
just asking, maybe can get some idea of it..
