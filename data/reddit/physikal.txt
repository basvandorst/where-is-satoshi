But why mine if there are no more coins to be mined?

How long until we can start offering storage with DriveMiner?

I'm not sure I follow. Tx fees go back into the chain as blocks to be remined? So essentially it could be mined forever, in theory?
@_date: 2014-02-10 07:08:02
I tried that and not one answer about why you would spend money on power to continue mining with no BTC reward. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 05:25:13
You are exactly why I still use coin base. Keep on keep'n it real.
@_date: 2014-11-23 06:05:25

I had to update the app (Circle) again after the iOS update. Then it worked.
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:51:30
Try this once more, 15000

iOS is a nightmare to dev for compared to Android. Wish Apple would fix that. 
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:50:11
I'm w/ thank you! (I hope this works) 15000 bits
@_date: 2015-04-09 21:45:17
I'll take it! Better than me accidentally sending him 5000 BTC heh.  Plus, it's sad that I don't know how to use changetip yet.  Shame on me.
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:51:17
dammit, tipped the wrong guy hahaha.
@_date: 2015-04-09 20:52:20
Aaaaaaand again.  15000 bits

This is quite funny.  If you are JPM, or any bank(s), how do build a system and convince people to use it when all the money comes back to you?  I would think most people would pick the system that doesn't load the pockets of a few select human beings, who are bound to be consumed with greed and corruption.  Let's face it, 90% of the time that's how we end up when we have that kind of money/power.
Edit: Those are just a few reasons of why Bitcoin is far superior.

Wouldn't these smaller "proprietary" networks be easily attacked/overrun by a hackers ASIC network if he were to breach the system and basically attempt a 51% attack, taking over their network?  
I believe the benefit of blockchain/Bitcoin and the currency/incentive behind it is that with all contributing minors, it's MUCH more difficult to take over the network.  I'm talking out of my ass here as my knowledge is limited. But this is my general understanding of it.

Anyone have a link to original video? Now I want to know what's so Damn funny
