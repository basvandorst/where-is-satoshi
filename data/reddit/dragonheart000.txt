So now we just upload this every day and upvote it to and the price will go to the moon!

Wait, this person that sent the bitcoin to the address may be onto something. One of the clues is


You get this from a [comment that op deleted](
We know there is an infinity symbol in here and an X inside a box. The X is already of **much** significance as it is THE ONLY thing in the entire image that overlaps anything and the thing it happens to overlap is the number 257, that text also happens to be the only thing, that I could find, that has some colouring that is off. There is an orange tinge to the bottom of the characters.
So here's the thing, if we draw a line from the infinity symbol to the X we get this: 
Notice the key words that are in the line: "Provide, fast, cash"
Now granted it is a long shot, but perhaps sending the address bitcoin would be noticed by a bot and then some bitcoin will be sent back to the address that sent it.
I don't fancy throwing cash at this to see what happens since I don't have the spare capital to do so. But this does seem to be a fairly logical solution that isn't 100% a shot in the dark and also could have been one of the consolation prizes that op was talking about.
If this is one of the consolation prizes that op was talking about it looks like the person that sent the bitcoin to the address may have missed out because looking at the address it appears to be an exchange, not a personal address.
Since this seems to be a thing we are doing: If this does help you out and you're feeling generous remember me :)

So I have noticed a few things on that name analysis.
1) If you save the image directly from the post you get the name you said "NdLEoUJCqNLlZFQBKEr7lxTK-PKQjqi5FtBM8k5lqs8" but as eliooses points out that is generated by reddit so we can throw that out.
2) If you open the image in a new tab you get the name "g4rbvtbiwry01" that may be of some significance. Same name if you save it from this tab obviously.
Remeber me if you crack it before I do :)
@_date: 2018-05-26 16:53:17
Actually yes it could be, op stated that there are consolation prizes in the image on top of the 1 bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-29 10:07:59
Is there even a -1 in the image? I have not found it; anyone else able to locate it?
@_date: 2018-05-26 16:37:10
Well solve this and then sell the bitcoin, add a bit more cash and buy her this dudes kidney

I thought CS has that but guess I was wrong, Dota2 is the most played.
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:04:04
Yeah I was really regretting that I had a lot of my btc loaned out at bellow 5% when I saw how often it hit 5% and stayed there today. But I'm hoping since a lot of my rates are fairly low but much higher than normal that they may let them stay open till the end
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:00:43
No you're guaranteed to get the money back. The person taking out the loan can not lose enough money to where they can not pay back the loans, if they do it auto cancels all loans and makes sure the lenders get all their money back and the money that was earned from the loans interest
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:10:46
Sooooo, is it still operational? I'd like myself some 5 free btc ;)
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:22:12
I have been waiting since $5k to buy a lot but wanted it to drop down back to $4k. It’s never gonna be that low again. I regret it a lot.
@_date: 2019-06-06 17:43:28
I was just watching that movie again last night with my girlfriend and I was thinking the exact same thing
@_date: 2019-12-02 02:45:26
I’m sure 90% of people on this sub would so in this theoretical where it did drop to $1 it wouldn’t stay there long at all.
@_date: 2017-11-06 14:09:15
I got in at a little over 1800. I just wish I put in more

CC partial world is very limited with what you can actually do well with it but the same effect may be achievable but it would make more sense to use a better plugin

If you keep your coins in an exchange they are not your coins.
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:47:35
I ordered mine off of amazon last Wednesday. It should arrive today hopefully
@_date: 2017-09-04 03:29:09
I saw one at a local gas station. I was gonna use it but the cut they wanted of my transaction was so high
@_date: 2018-02-12 16:21:10
I’m mining at viabtc.com, is this a good pool.  It’s kinda just the first one I joined as it was what the person I bought my miner from was mining in. It was also just a temp thing since I planned on experimenting by trying out different pools and even get my own pool going for me and my mates, not that we’ed expect to get anything but it would be a really fun project and something I could add to my website.

I wrote cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2019-09-13 11:05:14
I was in high school when bitcoin started really getting public notice and as I was already using it I was the cool person in my friend group that knew how it all worked. Only lasted like a week before people didn’t care nearly as much and then I was just the nerd again
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:50:46
So you and another person were saying to get out of poloniex specifically but what is it that you guys are seeing that I don't. I don't see any issues with them and know other people that use them too
Edit also I'm not keeping thousands only hundreds
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:29:06
I mean if all I wanted to do was sit on it yeah I wouldn't use a service like poloniex to keep my btc, but that's not what I wanna do, I want to lend it and exchange it so I can make even more money from it. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:20:33
Oh alright that makes sense thanks. The things you say Craig said don't really seem like the kind of things that Satoshi Nakamoto would say but I should do some more research, seems interesting
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:41:05
Almost never do I not have at least most of my cryptocurrencies lent out so I do do it VERY actively. I normally even check on it at least once a day to see if the loan is still active and loan rates and prices.
Also I'm only talking hundreds not thousands. It's an amount if not be devastated over if it all went away, of corse is still be pissed. I only got into cryptocurrencies about two months ago or so.
Thanks for addressing the fact that I actually like loaning it instead of just sitting in it which no one else has addressed.
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:35:28
From this sub I have only seen things against him never any of the lies you're talking about but perhaps I am just lucky; also I have only been subbed for a month or two so I am fairly new. Also I've been putting most of my attention towards eth and not as much towards btc so that may be part of the reason I haven't heard much and am not well informed. I do greatly appreciate you explaining it to me
@_date: 2017-07-16 20:29:22
I bought at $2700
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:31:29
But like I am using it all. I have all of it currently out on loans. Also it's not like I have a shit ton anyway, were talking hundreds not thousands. An amount that wouldn't devastate me if it all went poof but still an amount large enough that I want to grow it into more by lending and such.
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:44:37
I'm not trying to get rich per se but I want to increase my investment without spending usd since I don't really have enough to invest a lot.
Also the only risk with lending is having it on an exchange and before today I was unaware of that risk.
Also you make it seem like that risk is super prevalent but if it was wouldn't there be a lot less people who keep a lot in there?
Anyway I'm just looking to slowly grow what I have even if it does take a long while
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:18:38
Well from what you said, and of course I'll do more research, it is making me want to store it all in a wallet I control, however, what about lending. I like lending out my cryptocurrencies and correct me if I'm wrong I wouldn't be able to do that if I didn't have it in an exchange.
@_date: 2017-07-29 21:05:01
The risk seems so low though. But I feel this is a risk I'd be willing to take since as I said it does seem low and before today I saw 0 risk with poloniex. Sure it will make me rethink it but this is the first I'm hearing of it. Perhaps I'm just out of the loop though.
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:11:21
You just write down your private key and keep it on a paper? 
@_date: 2017-07-17 08:17:10
I was planning on buying some more eth if it hit bellow $100 but looks like it's going up again.
Also my mom bought some btc when it was at its peak but yeah I'm telling her to ride it out and maybe buy more
@_date: 2017-07-17 23:46:24
I know people that still think this whole cryptocurrency thing is a horrible investment and would be willing to bet against it if given the chance. One of the tries to remind me of how much I messed up by getting into it everyday but when I point out that if I sold out now I would still have a net gain from what I paid at first and they just reassure me that it won't be for long. I'm just gonna wait and eventually when they miss out I will run it in their face the same way they thought they could try to me, except cryptocurrencies have always been the winning side 
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:59:29
Well on poloniex rates hit 5% per day and is currently around 3.5% per day so I am making bank right now. I'd recommend checking it out however read a few more of the comments on this thread. A lot would disagree with me
@_date: 2017-07-06 21:38:04
Could someone ELI5 this to me? I've read a few of the recent posts but I've only fairly recently started caring a lot more about bitcoins and other cryptocurrencies
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:24:53
Yeah I know of mt Gox but don't know what you're referring to with btc-e.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:17:57
If it hit $1k I would dry out my bank account in a heartbeat and maybe ask my parents for cash too and offer to pay it back with interest
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:37:42
Okay so I kinda knew what happened before now but not really but with the spam I woke up to of people telling me about that I looked at it a bit more.
However, no one is addressing what I said I like to do with my btc. I want to lend it out which I couldn't do if it wasn't on an exchange. I'm not trying to just sit on it.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:26:18
Man now I wish I could say it was sarcastic :(
@_date: 2017-07-07 00:25:21
So why do some people believe he is? I mean there's gotta be some good evidence for him if the counter evidence is this blatant
@_date: 2017-07-29 10:51:44
Was gonna make a funny comment about it but then I couldn't really figure out why you wouldn't keep at least most of your money on an exchange. I have most of my cryptocurrency in a few different coins on poloniex all being lent out so I can make money on that. I don't see the issue
Edit: also yes I do have a wallet with some eth in it but almost all of my btc, all my doge, and some more eth are on poloniex.
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:44:42
On poloniex I am lending out btc at a rate of 4.7% per day which is the most absurd thing ever. Still, I probably would have made more keeping it becuase of bcc 
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:21:33
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:21:32
As for how long I intend to hold I'm not too sure but it would most certainly be over 6 months. But also the more I have the more I make. I don't really fancy spending $3k to get one btc but if I could slowly work my way up to one that would be great. I guess I should say, I'm not looking to make usd I'm looking to make btc also I've tried mining but I have a 1080 and nvida cards suck at mining. Most likely if I had another source of getting more btc other than spending usd on it I wouldn't be lending.
Edit: I've considered getting a miner but it's our if my price range and I've tried mining burst but that's been the biggest pain ever to set up and I only have 1tb that I had dedicated to it. When I was even able to get everything set up correctly with help from someone else that's I know mines burst it just simply wasn't working
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:47:46
What signs do you speak of? I haven't seen any. Could you show me
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:54:22
I came after the trollbox was gone (fairly new to the whole thing so I appreciate all this) but my boss who has lots more than I do on poloniex was there before it and he said it was taken out because people would try to get support from admins there instead of support tickets and admins couldn't help everyone also that people would try to manipulate prices by convincing others that the price would drop/ raise soon
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:03:11
Do you know if a better exchange becuase I still want to be able to loan out my btc, I want to get as much of a bitcoin as I can and I like having active loans becuase anytime I don't have a loan active I feel as though I'm missing out on my chance to get money
@_date: 2017-07-29 20:56:51
Yeah that's the best way to learn. I feel I am being very stubborn and I recognize that, however, it's most likely becuase I haven't learned yet and if I need to learn the hard way so be it. However I see this fork as HUGE loan rates and a perfect opportunity to lock in some good rates so I will not be pulling out of poloniex for this. Perhaps I won't put even more in though becuase of your warming since I was considering selling some cs skins for keys and selling those to a bot I use for more btc.
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:38:17
Is this a meme or something? It went right over my head if it is.
@_date: 2017-06-13 13:09:44
Oh that does gotta be really bad considering a lot can happen in a time period like that. Thanks for the heads up
@_date: 2017-06-13 02:21:44
I use poloniex. I am fairly new though, would you say that's a fine site to use?
@_date: 2017-06-13 03:42:01
Good to know
