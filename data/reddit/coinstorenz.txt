Yeah it kinda sucks.  I would love to go. Its a shame.  I know these events cost to put on.  The venue,, speakers etc but it still seems a little excessive
@_date: 2014-07-08 21:10:22
I live around the corner from this event.  I was so happy to see when they announced this.  I wad so gutted when I saw the cost of tickets.  $300+ if I recall just for entrance. I think you would get a way bigger turnout if the tickets were a more realistic price.I am absolutely Btc obsessed.and I'm seriously not considering going due to the cost alone. sad but true.

Edit : The price of " early bird tickets" is $350.
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:01:19
Well now that you have explained this I understand the costs.  I'm sorry for having a go but I was not aware the event would attract so many people.  Count me in for two.
@_date: 2014-05-27 11:39:28
so basically these guys are clearly cunts. there prices are unrealistic as fark.
I did happen to get some information from them. I dont know if these are their BTC address I have now way verifying this.
I tried....
here is one of their possible BTC addresses with around 100BTC in it.
heres another one apparantly with around 14 BTC.
again.  cunts.
but more importantly here is their paypal email address :
im notifying paypal of these shady farks now and you should to.
