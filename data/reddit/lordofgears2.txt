Yay, time to tip away!

Can you buy from the store in BTC...?
Seems ironic if you can't, ha

Why does your wife care? It's not really normal to think about divorce this early.. considering you're not even married

In your post you wrote, in response to someone saying it meant the US gave it value by selling,


Those are two completely opposite statements...? 
@_date: 2014-05-09 22:35:55
weeeeoooooow TIPS FOR ALL
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:13:57
Oh huh. I figured it would be who posted this. AKA bucky.
@_date: 2014-05-09 02:41:57
Oh! Thanks! That's awesome! You just made my day! 
Any ideas on what to buy with this?
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:22:58
That sub is horrible. This is a direct quote from one of their frontpage posts:


TLDR of that post?:


@_date: 2014-05-09 04:10:57
[Seems]( like I can do it, and I use T-Mobile.

Also, you should expect all your customers asking YOU about bitcoin. They will want to know what it's about, and of course will assume you will know as it's your restaurant. If you wish, you can learn up some on the coin, and maybe add a little booklet by the machine explaining BTC.

2k comments. I have a great chance for getting millions of bits, I just know it!
also, I'm kind of new to bitcoin, is there like a list of things I can buy with it?
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:10:21
And English to Japanese, or no?
@_date: 2014-05-14 23:38:41
Why shouldn't he? It will most likely stop trolls saying that he needs to learn how to speak before posting. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 21:47:13
You can use Virwox, but they take a heavy chunk.
@_date: 2014-06-30 08:02:21
lmao 
@_date: 2014-05-13 20:55:00
These are what make the BTC community worth it!
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:14:16
Why isn't posting this?
@_date: 2014-02-02 22:36:38


explain that?
@_date: 2014-05-13 13:12:54
It was sarcasm, because the money is sent with the internet, costing them probably nothing at all. Maybe the bank pays $50 a month for internet.
@_date: 2014-01-21 03:48:08
Why didn't i think of this?!
@_date: 2014-06-17 20:13:13
@_date: 2016-12-02 15:44:17
It did work :)
@_date: 2016-12-02 02:16:05
Who knows
I've been waiting for my transaction to go through for a lot longer than normal :/
@_date: 2016-12-02 04:58:13
Wait if you spend coins twice won't it like cancel one of them? Or what do you mean?
@_date: 2016-12-02 05:17:00
also happy cakeday
@_date: 2016-12-02 05:10:40
oh sad life :(
@_date: 2016-12-02 05:32:30
I sent basically all of it so the amount left was too small to even realistically pay a fee on. I bought more and will deliberately send some of the change coins with them once the NEW coins confirm. I just hope coinbases $.15 fee is good enough
@_date: 2016-12-02 03:56:45
I don't use Blockchain, but when you send BTC a fee is taken for the miners. This calculates the fee you need in order to be on the next confirmed block (aka fast as possible). Somewhere when you send BTC with blockchain there has to be an option to set the fee amount you want unless they don't allow you to (which would be stupid)
@_date: 2016-09-09 00:06:50
Lmao it's possible
Imagine you're the culprit. You install some miners in the back of the server room quietly.. making some bank for free. 
Then you are on reddit and see that someone found some miners... haha someone else didn't hide theirs well enough! Oh, shit, what if they're mine?? Oh, I'll just ask the state to see..
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:37:20
Oh, that makes sense. I never thought of it as a seller really, thanks for the help.
