I say good! More people will move to smaller banks and hopefully credit unions!
Fuck the big banks!

I like that and I am stealing that!

Compared to a market crash, a crypto crash would be negligible

Very helpful, thank you

Are you insulting my grandmother's retirement plan?!?!

Awesome success story you have. Basically financial independence and then some
@_date: 2017-12-17 00:16:20
That is not true

Way she goes boys!

Well if you are feeling philanthropic and want to pay someone’s student loans, send me a DM!
But seriously, that’s awesome! Good for you!
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:16:04
Thank you. That is amazing.

Are you making money through gains of the currency? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:36:27
This is great! What do you think of all the other cryptocurrencies though? I suppose there is room for all of them just like there are 100s of other currencies in the world.
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:15:54
Thank you!
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:51:59
Wow, awesome. Do you work as well?
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:14:23

Did you just insult nurses by saying they are uneducated? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:55:56
Hell yea. I call my btc “FOMO Insurance”.

$10?...good for you!

Likely the vast majority of that $4M is 401k. If his mortgage was 250K, cashing out 500K and paying cap gains plus state taxes probably netted about 350k or so

I was under the same impression until last week when someone showed me this:
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:21:23
Probably not because the system is rigged and he probably wouldn't have been allowed to debate. Bullshit

Lesson learned:
1. Get financial aid funds
2. Buy bitcoin
3. Study hard
4. $$$$$

Oh good lord...thanks

That’s not what this link states

What do you think about people who use market caps for the value of coin? A valid metric?
@_date: 2018-10-02 05:14:25
I hope you’re right. What makes you think it will be 10x in one year?
@_date: 2018-06-03 12:52:22
So your response is “put all your eggs in one basket”?
@_date: 2018-06-02 17:40:37
To get unbiased info, you should post to a crypto sub, not bitcoin.
If 8000 is all in, absolutely diversify. If you had money to invest in the stock market, you wouldn’t put it all in one stock. Crypto is no different

No one knows what is going to happen. Crypto currency is such a novel concept, there has never been anything like it before.
