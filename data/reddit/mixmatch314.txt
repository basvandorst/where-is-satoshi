If you aren't transacting there is no point in moving your coins now when you can wait for increased Segwit adoption overall, and lower fees as a result. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:41:30
A hodler would of course anticipate their transaction activity and move coins to a Segwit wallet before making further transactions. I mean if you want to proudly beat your chest because your funds are in a Segwit address, that's fine, but you aren't actually doing anything to improve fees and transaction congestion by doing so if you aren't making any further transactions on the network. When Segwit is implemented by the majority of individuals and exchanges that are regularly transacting on the network, the recent fees due to congestion should decrease and provide an good opportunity for holders to move their coins.

Yeah, the internet sucks for the same reason. IPv4, IPv6, ethernet, wireless, TCP, UDP, routing protocols, encryption layers, transfer protocols...

It is rather amazing how human cognitive emphasis on symbol identification and pattern matching allows us to see things that have a slightly similar shape, but are actually entirely different, as being "almost identical."
@_date: 2019-05-13 06:04:03
Even ignoring the blatant manipulation of the x axis by OP's comparison, one can see that while the trends may look similar, the variations are significant. One would likely find countless irrelevantly similar trends in various assets if we allow for skewing the scales of time and value as much as necessary.

@_date: 2018-12-15 02:19:11
Seems unlikely, but we are all free to speculate. BTW the larger the network the more people are invested in keeping it from going up in flames, thus decreasing the likelihood of anyone being able to pull off a successful attack.
Edit: I'd love to see a large attack attempt though. It would be a valuable data point regarding the long-term viablility of the PoW system and crypto in general.

@_date: 2018-12-15 03:54:24
Who the fuck is "trapped" in Bitcoin? There is no barrier to selling or trading it at any point in time. Also the number of disgruntled miners is not the same as the number of network clienteas that want to completely destroy the network, any investment they may have in the network, while also tarnishing the popular trust in crypto currency of handling assets securely. I do agree that Bitcoin could easily defend against some extreme attack vectors by changing the hashing algorithm, but it looks like hardware can be made for almost any implementation given enough time so that option would definitely anger anyone who has invested in hardware, as well as requiring constant maintenance.
@_date: 2018-12-11 11:25:00
You should take your own advice.
@_date: 2018-12-15 13:13:26


I'm pretty sure that developed out of the mining ecosystem all on its own. Bitcoin did nothing to stop it, which is different.
I guess you didn't hear about Monero forking this year due to hardware miners coming on the market? Ethereum saw hardware miners hit the network this year as well. I don't know anyone using this variable hash algorithm in the way you are suggesting, but I wouldn't be too shocked to see hardware come out that could support multiple hashing algos if there was profit to be made. Let's not ignore the challenge of developing and managing a system with increased complexity here.
Maybe there will be some miners that want to ensure everything they have invested in BTC becomes worthless. I guess we will see.
