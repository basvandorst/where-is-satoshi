I won't be fully buying into crypto until an alt coin is evenly distributed initially.  THEN people will have reason to trust a crypto ledger as a unit of account.

Yes; I just think that if we design a coin that can be distributed equally we'll get there faster.  It's a bit of a technical challenge though, and I've chosen other projects for the time being.

I have 6 questions regarding claiming my BTC:
I get an error when I attempt to log in at [ . (1) What am I doing wrong?
Details: I checked my balance successfully. As far as I recall I did NOT file for a bankruptcy claim. I attempted to log in a couple times.  The page just refreshed.  After the second or third time I got the Mt Gox error statements as shown here, [ .  I called +81-3-4588-3922 at 8:30 PM Japan time but no one picked up.
At [ , in the section “For users who did not file a proof of bankruptcy claim under the bankruptcy proceedings”, it states, “Login to the System with … (ii) the password **registered with the online system of filing proof for bankruptcy claim**.” (2) WTF? I just said I did not file a bankruptcy claim.
So I checked out the Offline Proof of Rehabilitation Claim Form. The last page of the form asks for username and password for your financial institution. (3) Do they really expect me to give that to them? (4) Or does it not ask that, but instead asks for your Mt Gox username and password? (5) If so, what do the other boxes reference, my Mt Gox info or my financial institution info? In what I presume to be the financial institution info section they ask for account number twice.  (6) Why?
I really cannot stand how idiotic this court is at attempting to produce something that people can use.

Yeah, I guess if you can't even find the name of a person who gave a talk you watched, it will be difficult to feed you any information you can absorb.

You will not find a book that contains all your seed words unless it is a dictionary.  I've tried it.  You won't even succeed with a 12 word seed.  Take [this seed]( for example.  [War and Peace]( is missing boost and script.

Haha!  That's basically what they're telling me.

As concerns your refund policy it simply comes down to this:   If your device does not work with a computer either get it to work with that computer or offer a refund.  That is how approximately every other peripheral electronics refund policy on the planet works.
Good point on the sources for the Trezor security links in this case.  I've updated them.  The link at the end of my article discussed gaining access to private keys, whether that is through memory dump or PIN bypass is irrelevant to a user.  Here's another story about dumping private keys,

How do I submit a non-link post (so I can give a description) in this forum?
