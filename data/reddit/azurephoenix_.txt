Having same problem with BTC.com, bought pre fork and I have no BCC/BCH in my chain.  Frustrating and confusing.

It was just delayed, finally showed up in their recovery tool.  Thanks for the help.  Btc.com has been great, not sure where to send it now as they don't support it inside the wallet however.

Politics front and center I see!

Forgive my ignorance but I bought BTC yesterday and deposited it into BTC.com which supports BCH and my wallet shows I have no available (BCC as they refer to it/BCH).
Did I do something wrong or does it just take time?  I use their tool to check my wallet as well.

Sounds like the same thing I hear as a penny stock is crashing and bagholders are trying to get out.

After losing money to penny stocks last year and seeing the types of people operating those scams.. I’m convinced those same people jumped on the crypto bandwagon, to pump and dump it the same way. No thanks.

Sentiment is extremely negative, government took this down and nothing will stop its fall until a negating condition exists.

Pretty common for pump and dumps.

Only people who are losing talk like this..  I own no bitcoin and I wouldn't touch this with a 10 ft. pole until the bleeding stops, no fomo even if I don't catch the bounce.  Not worth the stress.
