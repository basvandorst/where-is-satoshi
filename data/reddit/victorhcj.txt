Well if that's the case then that guy was not arguing that you can't be born transgender so your comment was still a pointless strawman.


Explain to me how the person who wrote this believes people can't be born transgender. All he's saying is that men can't choose to have periods and that women can't choose to grow beards

But he doesn't outright say it or imply it in any way. You make too many assumptions about people's believes

So you believe a man can decide to have a period?

I would if you would explain it but you don't even though I keep asking. You're willing to write that entire paragraph critiquing an idea but then you're not willing to explain why you think he holds that idea when I'm sceptical he does

He's not arguing that you can't be born transgender. Where did you even get that from his comment?
He's just saying that the idea that there's no difference between men and women is inaccurate. You don't disagree with that do you?

The fact that you even have to ask is proof enough of your bigotry, shitlord. Sexists like you are exactly why I run my Tumblr blog on intersectional feminism.
