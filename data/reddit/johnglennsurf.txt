Staking coins would be NEO as the return is 4% in the form GAS and its recommended by the Palm beach confidential.

Also if you do secure the coins I'd suggest staking in altcoins for a income just my 0.0000001 btc if i had 200 btc

I think you have to have bitcoin core to access your wallets not the same software as before.

Yep my dad actually met him during the Gemini and apollo program lived in orlando ever since, 
I'd suggest navcoin for starters but only for speculation as its a up and comer in the same vein as monero with a great roadmap and dev team, besides that theres a few I've been following that are based off the ethereum protocol and fintech startups. 
Privacy is in my opinion is king in crypto and people will pay handsomely for it.

Yes seriously I should just be able to use my debit card to purchase bitcoin or litecoins but noooo I have to go through 5 Russian merchant sites and there are compounded fees and costs associated with for a newer entry like me it's really ridiculous
