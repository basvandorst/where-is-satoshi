Funny way of saying "productive" vs "unproductive".


No it's not. The planet is fine.


Globalism is the reason there are two acid attacks per day in London together with one of the highest crime rates in the world. Globalism is why Sweden is the rape capital of Europe now. And the end result, the dissolution of the EU, is going to be one of the most violent periods of time imaginable as nationalists take back control of their countries. Think holocaust x 10. Thanks Globalism.

No, for the same reason that "technical analysis" is nonsense.
By applying ML/TA, you influence the price behavior of the asset in a way that your ML/TA did not take into account. Thus it cannot be used to predict price.
Say you apply your ML/TA to some history that has only natural "human" elements. Your ML/TA tells you (correctly) that the price is about to go up and you should buy. So you buy a bunch of the asset. But now since you've purchased the asset, you've influenced the market in a way that your ML/TA did not include in it's calculation, and by buying a lot you caused some other people somewhere to decide to dump a ton, so the price plummets due to behavior your ME/TA never expected.
The squiggles of the market are already composed of lots of people applying ML/TA to predict the price. Then more is caused by people who are running algorithms exploit the predictable nature of other people's ML/TA. So your ML/TA has to take other people/s ML/TA into account and so on forever. These feedback cycles are infinite and ensure that the behavior is essentially random.

Again, you're missing the point. Once ASIC technology is no longer changing, there is nothing to "time". All ASICs will be identical for many years. You might see 3-4 years between the release of new ASICs.

CPU development has already hit a dead end. You have no idea what you’re talking about.
The financial incentive to find ways to improve CPU speed is in the trillions of dollars, far greater than any bitcoin scraps, and CPU manufacturers have failed to do it for a while now. Clocks speeds stagnated 15 years ago. Now process shrinkage has stopped as well.
This is a far bigger problem than any crypto garbage. There is FAR less to optimize in a simple SHA ASIC than there is in an x86.

China has an advantage because they're the ones who developed and manufactured ASICs before everyone else. As a result, they had access to the best technology. By the time their ASICs have shipped out in necessary quantities to the rest of the world, they've already developed new ASICs.
This improvement is not infinite. The improvement of mining equipment will slow down and the rest of the world will have time to catch up.
In the end who has the highest share of the hashrate will depend largely on access to cheap electricity. Which is also why "ASIC resistance" is nonsense.

The hypothetical bar, not Gab. Idiot.


They've reached out to people who are currently being censored by established tech companies and platforms, which today is is anyone even slightly right of center. There is no evidence that they only wish to serve people with those views, and censor people with opposing (left wing) views. They get anyone they can for obvious business reasons.


No it's not, Islamic hate speech is sanctioned and even promoted on most social media and even cable media platforms today. Reddit for example is filled with anti-Semitic, anti-israel, anti-christian, anti-western, and pro-Palestine messages. The women's march itself achieved widespread positive media coverage despite being organized in part by Linda Sarour, a pro-sharia Muslim extremist that supports female genital mutilation and also receives favorable coverage on Reddit. The Democratic party itself right now is seething with anti-Semitism from its increasingly Muslim constituents and representatives.
Twitter is filled with Islamic extremism that they don't remove. I think at one point ISIS was even recruiting people using Twitter.


Left wing and Muslim extremists have no reason to go on Gab because they are welcome to express their views on mainstream media platforms.

Sorry but yes. You're suggesting that character and credibility are not factors when deciding whether somebody's argument is right or wrong. And that's nonsense.
Humans are not computers, and rely overwhelmingly on heuristics to determine what is right and what is wrong. This was identified as far back as Aristotle's Art of Rhetoric which separated persuasion into 3 parts, only one of which has anything to do with having a sound argument.
If a man ran up to you on the street and told you that the CIA was after him and put chips in his brain and if you help him he'll reward you with a billion dollars, would you believe him? Is your choice based on the merits of his arguments? Or his character?

First off, this isn't true. China has a whole buttload of issues that makes it difficult for them to manufacture anything more than plastic toys for mcdonalds happy meals. Did they make good crypto ASICs? Sure. But they're  behind in many more important semiconductor markets.
Secondly, a lot of their technology has been attained simply through theft, and many people are trying to make them pay a price for it.
Thirdly, the rest of the world doesn't need to manufacture their own ASICs, they'll just buy them from China.
The issue isn't that China is a lead manufacturer in ASICs, that doesn't really give them that big of an advantage. The issue is that they had first-access to the best ASICs as they were being developed. As this plateus, the advantage they have disappears and mining centralization becomes a function of access to cheap electricity.

The definition of the word crypto. You don't seem to actually understand what these words mean.
Crypto currencies aren't limited by "adoption". That's always been nonsense. They're limited because they suck because they can't actually scale. It's a technology problem.

Then you're wrong. Value is created by supply and demand. Both are dependent on context.
 Bitcoin has value because of a fixed supply, and a demand. Historically, there has always been demand for hard-to-counterfeit assets that can be used as a currency.

No we don't. That's the whole point.
Off-chain scaling is achieved through new ideas and innovation. Lightning, 
On-chain scaling is achieved by selling off bits of decentralization for a bit more performance that is a dead end anyway.

Or the could serach for his username all of the net and see if he used it before. OP's doesn't seem to be a throwaway. Or he might screw up in the future.
Or they could follow transactions of exactly 10 BTC in the last few days and see if he ever posts his address or transactions somewhere online, linking the coins to his identity.

It's a bit different with hashes. Say you hashed all numbers from zero to 2^256. Would you have seen all possible Sha256 hashes? No. Because plenty of them could have collided, so there are still hashes you haven't seen. So is there a set of items you could hash to guarantee that when you're finished you've seen all possible hashes? No, at least in theory.
"Progress" can only be made if there is some fixed set of candidate strings to hash in which it's guaranteed at least one will hash to your desired hash. So if you've made it half way through the set, you know you're at worst 50% of the way to finding the hash.
But in Bitcoin/Sha256, there is no such set. You can keep adding arbitrary data into the blocks **theoretically** forever (in practice, you're limited by block size). This could mean that for some blocks, there is no solution. Although this is extremely unlikely.
There is a fixed number of lottery tickets, so you're making progress. But there is an infinite number of things you could hash. Even if the difficulty is set so low that statistically 1/10 hashes will be correct, you could hash for a million years and never find it if you're extremely unlucky.

The main problem is here:


You need to think more about what this means. All this means is that at a given moment, people were willing to give you $100k your X amount of Bitcoin. That's it.
Tomorrow you could check and see that you now have $95k USD worth of Bitcoin. So now people are only willing to give you $95k. What happened? Did the value of Bitcoin go down? Or did value of the USD go up? You need a lot of other information.
Another problem is here: 


No it's not. Bitcoin value can be expressed in terms of anything else you want to trade for it. Dollars, Euros, pokemon cards, mittens, cats...whatever.
Nothing is based on anything. It's all just about what you can trade for it. Always think about "value" in terms of trade. Nothing else makes sense.
