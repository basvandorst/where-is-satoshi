We had an agreement from you that you will no longer work with 1btcxe for return of the coins you earned. you agreed. Why are you back on their site?

This person is a fraud and had submitted false documents on his application. Repeatedly lied about his identity. 1btcxe has blocked him several times in the past and he continues to sign up using different emails. We requested from him several times that he stops using any of the exchanges we work with. No one took any of his coins.  Easy to come online and to try to blame some else for him submitting false documents to a financial institution.

Bitcoin survives based on the utility that it provides, Not on the BTC/USD ratio. It was never about the Fiat side of the coin. It was always about the ease of use for merchants and buyers to interact with each other.

Its not a concept. Bitcoin is currently being used as a medium of exchange for goods and services. I have been personally using it for that exact purpose over the last couple of years. If you just buy bitcoin to sit on it, it won't do anything for you. If you actually used it for what it was designed for, it is one of the greatest things ever.

Everyone claims they are Bitcoin experts, so this will be a nice way to actually test them before they get hired. Go get certified, accredited then come back to see us.

You move the funds from your Crypto Capital account directly to an Exchange that also has an account with Crypto Capital. The transfer is internal and instant.  GTS is one of the funding options your have to send funds into your account.

You still need a bank and a credit card to use Apple-Pay.. Bitcoin solves this issue to the many people around the world that are currently unbanked and don't carry a credit card around. There is plenty of room for both Apple, Google and Bitcoin to grow.

Bitcoin was not created for speculation. It was created to fill a need by the 80% of people in the world that don't have access to a bank and a credit card. It was designed to cut out the middle-man. That is why people feel that it is worth $500 or $50 or $5000.  Two years ago no one wanted to give me $10 for BTC, today there are plenty of people willing to give up $500 or more for just 1 little virtual BTC.  There is a need and a place. It may not be there for you at the moment, but people invest in companies where they don't necessarily use the product or service of that company - And that is the speculation side of BTC to USD.

We are not a High-tech company with a flashy site. If you like to improve on our current site we will be happy to listen... We take care of the Fiat legacy banking side of things.

If I could send Beanie Baby as easy as I can send BTC everyone would probably have Beanie Babies everywhere.
