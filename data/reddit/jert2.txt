I've done a lot of reading on the subject, and for anyone that uses a logical and rational thought process, not one based on tradition or 'just because',  bitcoin is a much more valid form of currency than fiat debt-money. 
I love reading the banking cartel's anti-bitcoin propaganda. For the majority of the arguments they use, they be can applied exactly to fiat money, with more effect. 
IMHO, the greatest strength of bitcoin is how difficult it is to counterfeit and create.
Our current global financial system makes almost no sense, it is borderline fantastical. But it is so dominant folks can't understand how an economy could work with non-debt based money. Or money backed by gold, like it used to be (and should still be, if the citizenry demanded their government to follow the Constitution). 
When you have a **private company** printing the global measuring stick of worth (USD) that every currency is pegged against and **profiting 6% from every dollar they create** by creating an IOU and selling it for another IOU (which is a promise that the tax payer will pay for the dollar in actual wealth) you have a serious problem.  
And then later down the road when you have Goldman Sachs effectively creates and controls your government's economic policy, you have even a greater problem. 
Then when you can loan $100 or $1000 for every dollar you have in the bank, things get worse. 
I sincerely believe that is far more likely that fiat will have a major collapse (say, lose &gt;80% of its worth) than will bitcoin. 
I encourage anyone to read up on how money is created, how money used to work in history (when it was backed, or made out of precious metals) and how Goldman Sachs employees (and other banks) have been changing governmental economic policy in their favour to a tremendous extent over the last 2-3 decades, and furthermore, how likely this house-of-cards system will crash (a fiat currency has never survived that long in historical terms, against the wealth of rare commodities or metals). This system is explicitly designed to move money up, not down. This is simply a fact, just look for yourself and how wealth is becoming more and more concentrated to the few thousand people on top of the pyramid. And more so each year.
You should also know that every fiat dollar you save will likely lose about 5% or more of its worth over the next 12 months. 
Finally: ask yourself if it makes any sense that the majority of 1st world, wealthiest countries in the world are looking at bankruptcy? Then ask yourself where did the money go? And then realize that most major corporations, such as Apple, pay less than 2% tax, and finally, you will see, just how screwed you are getting from our financial system. 
If wealth was even **remotely** dispersed evenly there would be a severe lack of people who sadly spend their lives and energies making money for someone else in jobs they have no passion for. You do not have to live your life like that, it is a choice that you can make. 
Bitcoin is going up so fast more so because fiat currencies are losing value against it, because bitcoin is not created from thin-air. 
Goldman Sachs employees in the government: 
6% profit, which increases with 'quantitative easing' i.e printing more debt-money which is then used to purchase real assets, such as commodities or real estate: 
It is more fair to say that fiat currencies are a 'bubble', then bitcoin. Why? Because again, fiat debt-money is created from nothing and must inflate to survive. Once the inflation goes run-away (which happens most of the time) the currency will collapse. Do you think this will go down? 
How does an economy work using debt-based money? Well if you were born today in America, your share of the national debt would be about $400,000 right off the top. **Your government has promised you'll pay your entire life's wages to cover the interest on some purchases made a few decades ago.** You may haven given 50% of what you earn working full time, your entire life, to pay for some tank that was never used, or some great night out for a visiting politician. That's sad, no ? 
Imagine if you had 40% more assets. Did you know income tax is a very new invention? 
Read the Constitution. It's a great read. It says really wild stuff, like you can not be spied upon without just cause. And stuff like the government can't sell you into debt-slavery the moment you are born. Really far-out ideas that people actually died for, to see it pass -- can you believe it? 
We now have an alternative option. A viable one. For the information age. The age of iron and machines is coming to pass. Debt-money won't last. Cryptographic currencies will. They are the future. Get off the sinking ship and get on board.

A much better primer on the realities of our money situation is the great documentary series  "The Hidden Secrets of Money" . I recommend checking that out if you want to be informed. It isn't bullshit, it's facts on the fallacies and dangers of our present day world economic system. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 09:51:42
That is silly to say, because how do you know that at least 6% of the world's assets, fiats, real estate or whatever, are not owned by criminals? They likely are...

May get down-voted for this, but I'd just really be surprised if any person in their early eighties could wrap their head around bitcoin. 
I don't think I've met anyone in their 80's that even fully understands how the basics of email works -- and these are the better ones, most older seniors I've helped in IT get confused with the differences between 'THe Internet' and a web browser.

HSBC helped out drug cartels more than Silk Road ever did. Silk Road were individual sellers.  HSBC's buddy drug cartels moved product for entire countries, WAY more volume. Yet you don't here about how the U.S dollar is a 'criminal dollar' and that it should not be used anymore.

Fiat currency oligarchs are also what, about 50x, 100x more common in the non-bitcoin world.  
So bitcoin would be an improvement. 
Too lazy to look up exact stats, but its somewhere around 35-45% of bitcoin is held up the bitcoin elite, whereas I would imagine 80%-98% of the world's fiat wealth is controlled by the elite. So its progress.

I just wish people would stop using Gox. They are directly responsible for at one of the few major crashes of bitcoin, more likely, responsible for the three of the major crashes. 
Yet people always go back. It is frustrating.

Please stay out of the 'bitcoin fraud' . Have fun with your debt money and  being ass-rammed by the banks your entire life.

Just STOP using GOX everyone PLEASE. 
Did folks stop using them after they helped (or arguably caused) the first and second big price crashes? No.... [shakes head].... 3rd crash, and now this? I really hope people stop using them.

Okay I'll give you two payment options. Anyone? Okay on one hand you could be paid in a currency that gains over 1000% a year.  In the other, a currency that declines in purchasing power by 5% a year.  Hmmm...this is going to a tough choice, gonna give you time to think about that.

Keep in mind, most of the bankers and other monterary policy makers are baby boomers who just barely mastered the use of email after 10 years of practice --  for many of them, no doubt the technical nature of bitcoin is beyond consideration.

That's not what he saying at all draygonia, you are way off. 
His move probably had a lot to do with how Facebook is forced to give complete access to the NSA and other member of the Five Eyes states.  Judging from his reasons to get into bitcoin, I would assume that he is not morally okay with having to lie to the public regarding the data mining. Especially as an IT security professional whose job it is to protect users from illegal data access by criminals.
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:04:55
My take on it is that he left BECAUSE of the NSA illegal data collection going on. He seems like a moral person that would have trouble having all the facebook info being easily accessible by the spy agencies--- of which is going on, and which he can not talk about under threats and court orders from said agencies.

You need a decentralized exchange for a decentralized currency. It's the natural fit. The software should be open source and done through a software protocol not a website. 
Projects towards this direction are in the works and I hope they come to fruition (coming from a guy who lost cryptocoins to corrupt and hacked exchanges). 
@_date: 2014-03-14 00:42:58
Awesome man, know exactly what you are saying. 
The most excited I have ever been about IT has been bitcoin, matched only by the crazy dot com days of the late 90's.  It really feels like something new and vastly important has been undertaken and there is so much growth that if you have a great idea you can make your own niche in the new economy we are building.

I was going to write the exact the same thing until I saw that you beat me to it. 
Exactly what you said. A currency that is not completely fabricated will always do well against a commodity, asset, or backed currency (either backed by gold, or back by proof of work, like bitcoin). 
Our world fianicial system is a very dangerous house of cards that is almost guaranteed to fail in the next decade, whereas bitcoin is a commodity that can not be counterfeited and can be accepted internationally.
Cryptocurrencies will eventually replace fiat currencies I believe, now that we are really getting into the Information Age, it is just more logical system of exchange than fiat paper-printed debt-money.

The Canadian dollar is not a 'mainstream currency' ??? Where the fuck do they find these so called experts? I don't understand why, for an article on Bitcoin, often fianancial papers seem to ask people who don't any idea about Bitcoin (or even really the realities of modern semi-magical Goldman Sachs/American gov' monetary policy).
 ""It's never going to be a mainstream currency," says Stephenson. "If you go to Cabo and you need to take a taxi and you give someone a $10 US bill, they know exactly what that is. You give them a Canadian dollar bill with Gene Wilder on it, they don't have a clue what that is. And, ultimately greater acceptance is what's necessary to calm volatility."

Please folks. Just stop using Gox, it is that simple. They have been directly responsible for at least 2 major crashes, probably 3. 
The company is staffed by a large proportion of morons.

Same here ! I CPU mined bitcoin when I first hurt it mentioned. I stoped after 3 or 4 days deciding that although bitcoin was a great idea, it would never catch on.  
Each time it has gone up, to 10$, than 30$, than $150, etc etc to the last ATH, I could not believe it. Now a days I don't doubt any price it could go to. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 05:02:19
Yes, I think that is exactly what happened here. 
He could not, because of being a moral person, allow this to happen to users without at least being able to tell them it was happening.

Been enjoying MDMA, about 1 - 5 times a year, for over 10 years, and it has yet to lose its magic  =D
The problem with MDMA is actually getting good pills though, can be tough unless you have a solid dealer. 
I wouldn't try a pill with a print like that before reading up on it on pillreports.com

Congrat's.  Hold on to the coins, hold on to the coins, hold on to the coins.  Maybe you already know this.  But I can imagine your smile will be huge when a customer who paid in BTC today for his $300 vaporizer, and you wait a year, and it'll turn he actually paid you $3000 for that vaporizer. That'll be a good feeling.

Ya I hear that. Somehow I was convinced by many of my friends who know 1/10th of what I what I do about Bitcoin to sell many coins around the $250 mark. My bad. But whatever, considering I bought them around $20 it was fine, and I still am holding on a few so, I guess I'm not too broken up.
