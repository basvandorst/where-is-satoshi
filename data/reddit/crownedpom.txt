What do you think? It probably won’t be that much because I will have to pause it sometimes when I want to game etc.

That’s true! Could I get more out of it by over clocking my GPU?

Would it make a difference over clocking the GPU? According to nice hash, I could make $78 monthly.

Why wouldn’t everyone mine Zcash if it was an equivalent exchange to bitcoin? Also, what do you yield daily since we have the same GPU?

Making over $2.00 a day! I feel hopeful. Bear in mind, this is just for fun!

You mentioned you mine Zcash with EWBF. May I ask how much you yield Daily/Weeky/Monthy? If you don’t want to say you can PM me. Is Zcash a close or equivalent exchange for buying bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:50:15
Wait so you mine Zcash and buy bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-07-30 20:50:40
It's more than $2, my friend!

I haven’t heard good things about Jaxx. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:25:11
$76 a month isn’t bad in my opinion!
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:21:20
I just edited it. My apologies, it’s late and I completely forgot to add the specs! 
@_date: 2017-07-30 08:37:15
What can I buy with Zcash?

Isn’t 1 ZEC every 11 days with EIGHT GPU’s? Did I read that correctly? Lol. I’m just tying to figure out with my single GTX 1070 if I can make a little profit for fun. I have a hard time understanding the 
.00030322554 looking numbers.
