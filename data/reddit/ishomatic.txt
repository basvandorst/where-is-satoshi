Interesting, who came up with it first? Just curious?

I think people are overlooking the fact that BitGo's daily limit policies are useless if you don't also monitor for discrepancies between txs signed by bitgo vs txs actually published to the Bitcoin network.
I posted about this here: 
But have yet to receive feedback.

* 1) Ask the people of Cyprus (or the customers of MF Global) about getting their deposits back.
* 2) Exchanges getting hacked != Bitcoin being hacked.
* 3) You are correct to be concerned about security, far too many people don't give it enough thought. The thing is Bitcoin (if you control your own keys) gives you direct control over your money. With the bank they are in control and you are beholden to them to do the right thing.
* 4) If you are not comfortable with the volatility then it's probably not for you. But volatility works both ways, up and down.

You obviously don't know Gün.
He may have published more original research on Bitcoin, smart contracts and crypto currency related topics than any other academic.

Agreed that BitGo should care from a marketing perspective. But are they legally or morally responsible? I'm not saying I know the answer. My point is that it doesn't seem very clear cut to me. We don't know that they didn't provide them with best practices. And we don't know they didn't check exactly what Bitfinex was doing to the best of their ability. From what I know about BitGo they probably did.

Thanks for the reply. Its good to see an overview of who's publishing. I didn't mean to imply I know a lot about the state of academic research community, just that he has published a lot.

Not in 2015? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:17:17
Using BitGo is not just like a hot wallet. You define a security policy and they only sign the transaction if it fits with in that policy. 
Now, if I sell you a security tool and you don't implement it correctly i.e. (Badly defined policy) am I responsible? 
I guess it depends on some factors, like did I properly train you how to use it? Did I audit your implementation and give you good advice? Did you ignore the advice?
I can't see how you can make a blanket statement about BitGo's fault with out knowing the full story.

No problem. But, do I need to report my realized gains from that tip? ;)

Not only that but using keybase.io's interface ( the message doesn't even verify. Could be user error on my part, please correct me if I'm doing something wrong.

No. Netagio is a separate company from Goldmoney. It just happens to be owned by the same people. 
I have a Goldmoney account and would LOVE IT if they let me transfer money into my account mainly because my bank in the US routinely make it more and more difficult to do international wire transfers. Also it would make it much more affordable to do dollar cost averaging on a monthly basis in to my account. Hopefully they are thinking about offering this soon.

Thanks for the feedback guys. My experience with them is very much like tunaretunare's
The lower level support people obviously can't figure out what the problem is but rather than give me a refund or credit they just keep telling me they'll get back to me, but then don't. It's super frustrating and I have no idea what to do.
@_date: 2016-06-30 22:27:40
ABRA balances are denominated in fiat, the value is stored on your phone backed by bitcoin and a hedge against the fiat currency. So, it's not really a bitcoin wallet in a traditional sense.
@_date: 2016-06-30 22:11:22
Whoa!? I think you guys are being a little harsh on the Planet Money folks. Sure, this story was pretty weak and they totally left out some of the key components of the story that make it interesting and less one-sided. But I truly doubt this was intentional bias on their part. I listen to the podcast all the time and granted it's pretty mainstream and light on details, but the stories are generally pretty interesting.
I'm pretty sure they would have just used the default send option in the blockchain.info wallet. It's been a while since I used that wallet and I have no intention of using it again so I can't be sure. Having transactions not go through because of a too low fee has been a very common experience for a lot of people over the past year or so. In that sense the way they reported on it was not dishonest at all.
You got to look at it from the point of view of a layperson. The block size debate is difficult enough to understand for someone intimately familiar with Bitcoin. Even if the Planet Money reports fully understood it, which I doubt they do, they would still have to dumb it down for their audience.
I will grant you that this was not Planet Money's best work. It felt really dated as well, like this should have been aired 6 months ago. Almost as if they recorded the show back in January never aired it because it kind of sucks and are just digging it out now because they need something to fill a gap in their programming.

I bought bitcoin as soon as I could after learning about it. But it's true I wish I bought more. I only bought enough to play around with. If I had bought even a modest sized investment I would be able to retire now. :/
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:05:15
I thought people did this mainly for shady stuff like personal financial information.

Dude, stop telling me how I should use my bitcoin!

Nice. 
Maybe the first frame should be the QR code so when sites like reddit create a non-anmiated thumbnail it doesn't show up as a white box.

Obviously Paypal is only going integrate bitcoin in a way that benefits them, but I think bitcoin could actually save them a lot of money. They must spend a fortune dealing with credit card fraud and disputes from charge backs.
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:04:27
I'm sure you are right that the banks would win any court case, but I would still like to see that court case play out.
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:49:40
Paypal doesn't get 3% the credit card company does, that's why you don't get charged when you fund your account with a bank account.
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:24:30
Not only that... but they were purposefully processing withdrawals in an order to maximize the number of overdraft fees. If you had a $5 charge, $1 charge, and then a $20 charge with $24 in the account. They would process the $20 withdrawal first and then $5 one, that way they can charge you overdraft twice. Sneaky bastards.

Kryptokit looks awesome. But it doesn't appear to be opensource. Or at least I can't find any links to the source anywhere.
@_date: 2013-12-11 17:01:38
Oh, for a merchant accounts. But not for personal transactions. 
Anyway a lot of that fee goes to the credit card companies. Which is how most of those transactions are funded. When people do use paypal balances and/or bank transfers paypal profits quite a bit. Plus they probably get a much lower credit card transaction fee because they do so much volume. But 2.9% is pretty standard for a small volume merchant account. It's about the same for Square etc. Paypal is just charging the market rate.

Super nice. I just installed it and sent some extra change I had sitting in my localbitcoins.com account. A couple feature requests:
1) A setting to use millibits would be nice. Especially since I will probably only use this for small payments.
2) It would be nice it it pulled in the price from bitcoinaverage.com and showed you the fiat equivalent for your balance and payments.
Also, it seems to crash a lot.
@_date: 2013-12-11 02:53:56
I totally agree that PayPal could seemlessly integrate Bitcoin as a funding source for their wallet. But I'm not sure why the volatility would be an issue. 
The user holds bitcoin in their account when they want to fund a payment paypal converts the bitcoin, takes a cut, and sends the recipient fiat.

I signed this petition a while ago. 
I've been a long time iPhone user (since the first version) then last friday I bought a new  Galaxy S4 precisely because I want to use bitcoin apps. I'm still getting used to it but so far it seems pretty nice. Now that I've made the switch I don't care so much about Apples blocking of bitcoin apps.
@_date: 2013-05-24 00:15:36
Actually I heard from a good source claiming that was precisely  Erik's motivation for creating Satoshi Dice in the first place. To draw attention to the fact that the current implementation of bitcoin does not scale all that well in terms of volume of transactions. 
Luckily there are quite a few ways to improve the situation and people seem to now be hard at work on those solutions.

Is there a way to get better logs? I opened the developer console but didn't see any messages.

Oh, we misunderstood each other. I was talking about personal transactions not accounts. If I were buying bit coins from my friend I would use a personal transaction.

Me too, I'm thinking about getting the Nexus 5. (another suggestions? I'm not up on the latest Android models)
I tried using an Android a few years ago and liked the OS... my main complaint was that it didn't have a lot of the Apps I wanted to run but now that Apple is banning apps that I would use every day they're making the idea of switching quite compelling. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 03:13:59
That perspective makes a lot of sense on one hand... but it also sounds like an awfully convenient argument for banks to not work with any company working with Bitcoin, a revolutionary technology that directly competes with the banking system's monopoly over the current financial system.
@_date: 2013-12-12 01:01:11
Yeah, I use paypal all the time and never pay fees. see below.
You do? Is it different in different jurisdictions, maybe?
