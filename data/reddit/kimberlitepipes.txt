Haha - that is awesome - I showed her this and she laughed - fabulous 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:09:32
That’s her wallet since she did the Science Fair Project on bitcoins. She saves her chore, babysitting and little monies and buys a few bits here and there of bitcoins. I also add to it thru the years as I have a little extra. 
It’s her wallet. I think she will use it for college or just keep holding. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:14:08
Gotcha. That’s probably what I need to do. Thanks for the help. This sounds like a good plan. Right now it’s just in a safe deposit box. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:29:56
When she did this in 2014, she passed out paper wallets with small amounts of bitcoin to about 30 classsmates. 
Those 30 kids are all now about 15 and  they all have their wallets, so cool. My daughter made sure they added little bits to their wallets in the bitcoin lows (and highs - haha). 
Some have never spent and are saving for college or gonna hold for the long haul. 
Little Alaska group of crypto kids talking about decentralized banking, forks, and the current issues with bitcoin now when they hang out.  
All from this little science project in 2014 - thanks again r/bitcoin - would not have been possible with you ��
Now I just have to worry about the dating thing and turning 16, and driving. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:24:49
i agree. Agree a lot. She is a good kid, and she has been good at taken our advice, and i think will just hold and not spend a lot. :)
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:40:21
She had a blast.  She has so many friends that has set up wallets for that now have bitcoins. I can’t believe the price then was around $ 850.  Funny to look at this project - I have it saved for her. ��
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:50:22
[hypothesis ]( 
@_date: 2017-12-26 00:14:39
Yep. I put the private key away for her in safe spot. She is 15 now. I figure when she turns 18 she can decide what do to with her wallet. 
Maybe help her with college or I think she just like holding and watching. And adding to it - haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:28:29
No she is looking at a 77 bronco with drum brakes and some rust in the panels - gets -40 below zero here - haha - not sure what to buy her ��
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:48:33
She says thank thanks thanks x 10 ! :) 
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:02:03
I was involved, she has seen it on the news as well. She reads about it and she is really smart with computers so this came naturally to her. 
She comes alive with excitement when she talks about crypto currency and how it will work in the future. I think she envisions this being a big part of her generations currency. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:12:15
i just showed her it, and she is reprinted and has fixed that sentence, thank you she said.
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:50:53
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:12:40
I am gonna figure out how to get them shots of her presentation and the details, excellent idea. Yes how interesting that she used a macbook pro to mine bit coins and basically process her bit coins and research and her FIRST BITCOIN purchase was an iPad case cover for her iPad, kinda ironic ! haha

@_date: 2014-02-07 20:27:42
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:44:51
oh thanks so much, - i sent her a pic of this little comment section and she said tell all of you she spent recess at school with all the kids gathered around her going over paper wallets and the difference between public address and private keys, how mining works, what future bitcoins will hold for her generation, investing, hash rate, and so many other questions she said. so cute ! 
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:26:55
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:26:24
Okay I understand now. Thanks ! 
@_date: 2014-02-06 17:55:06
UPDATE: she has everything set up and she is ready for her presentation. Here is a picture of set up (she will add laptop and other stuff during her speech) 
She had kids and parents coming up to talk with her about Bitcoin and she is explaining it over and over to everyone. I heard comments from so many people this morning like "I heard about Bitcoin in the news, wondered what that was". It is exciting for her and she is really interested. 
She had 6 sub categories that she could have placed her topic of Bitcoins under for her Science Fair. One of the subcategories was Investigation/Research - this is what she and her teacher chose was the best category for this topic of Bitcoins. She is only 11.
She has a little savings bank account, and has had one since an infant, we live in Alaska and every one of her PFDs (and other $$ - birthday $$, christmas $$) has been placed in her little savings account, so her initial seed money to Coinbase was from her savings account - yes I helped her transfer it, but it was her money and her investing. Her bank account is for her college one day.
I am proud of her and  would imagine that there will be thousands of people that will see her project and learn a little more about Bitcoin, and that is good. She is a really smart little girl, and I support anything that interests her. I will update after I know how she did at today presentation. 
Thanks everyone for the support of her, she has read the comments and just smiles, you all are awesome to support her ! 
UPDATE after presentation: She is home from school, and she said all went well, she felt good and spent all day explaining Bitcoins and how things work. She said the judges asked about mining (she demonstrated her little mining on Bitminter with her USB block erupter), they asked about benefits and she explained transparent and decentralized banking, she discussed difficulty levels in mining, she discussed is value since start, she discussed consumer opportunities in use with current business and potential vendors. She told me that she was asked about process and she discussed about how she got help from r/bitcoin and read about it, she talked about her interview and visit with local crypto currency expert and miner u/joemattie, he really amazed her with his intelligence and abilities (this guy is a genius and amazing) - we will know her results in the morning it seems, judges still finishing up. 
thanks r/bitcoin ! she is asking why there is not a reddit for kids now, she thinks there needs to be one. Hmm good idea. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 03:40:37
thanks so much ! she is excited to use the bitcointip and she is smiling ! she is gonna show this tomorrow when she presents her project :)
@_date: 2014-02-06 03:31:30
she says thank you so much ! she is gonna show her address activity on her bitcoin address and this will be awesome she said ! thanks again ! 
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:17:34
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:33:31
@_date: 2014-02-08 06:50:35
I showed her - she will fix it - thanks so much :) 
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:53:56
you explained her mind beautifully ! She learned a lot and it made her want to learn more, so thats a good thing !
@_date: 2014-02-09 03:02:26
its suppose to be -35 below zero tonight - i am from florida (native lake city florida girl) but i married me the hottest eskimo man in alaska 20+ years ago and made me a florida/eskimo baby girl and life is good ! but it gets too cold here ! 
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:56:00
i will do that. She has some my sister gave her, but its time for more, this project has really made her really interested. She seems very happy it comes to her naturally
@_date: 2014-02-06 08:02:06
You are a superstar ! She talks about you in her speech tomorrow and she has been mining with her block erupter (she cant take her eyes of it) - she is so thankful for your time !  
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:27:08
Oh boy another "miner like me" she said. Thanks so much. she only has a tiny ASIC block erupter and her mining amounts are real small - but she makes that little thing work hard and watches all the details. Again, thanks so much ! 
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:33:19
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:56:55
thats great !
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:31:45
i just saw Raven (my daughter) and she said thanks so much and it will be there forever for her college fund, and to tell you that lots of kids at her school are now bringing home info to their parents about Bitcoins (she gave out info sheets to all about Bitcoins) - so fun for her ! 
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:24:11
Okay - I will. I have a section on the board for loans so this will be included ! You all are awesome ! 
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:23:56
She is not spending anything, she is just gonna save it for college she says and i support this. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:23:00
She is up now and she said thanks so much. Today she is going to help some kids do a couple bitcoin purchases and guide them. They are all in the same class and they are gonna watch it grow together. She said tell him it's for college :) 
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:41:54
i sent her a copy of what you just wrote via a text and she replied "yes, mom, i know" hahahahaha - sadly at 11 she is smarter than me - hahahaha
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:59:28
Yes, are far as i know, she is the only one that did crypto currency, she presents tomorrow and she is READY ! She has practiced and practiced - Her talk is great and she knows more than me really. I will update tomorrow with what happens at the judging.
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:52:56
She is only 11, so smart, and Bitcoins are her interest, and I just let her go for it. Its not perfect, but i am a proud of her for not doing something simple, she spent hours and hours and more hours learning all of this. 
It was hard to kinda get it all on a board, but she has lots to talk about as she presents it and really enjoyed learning about mining, and how the process of Bitcoins works. She wants to teach all the other kids and teachers about Bitcoins and what she learned, so its a win win for her and her generation. And i love her too much to not help and support  her with things that interest her. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:32:46
fairbanks, alaska
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:46:31
i texted her again at school and she said that Litecoins and other alt coins are gonna be her weekend project to study them and learn more, she said tell you thanks so much ! 
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:44:40
That's funny :) 
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:24:16
i showed her this and she is reading about it now !:)
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:23:25
She as been watching Bitcoins and reading about mining for some time. We have had those dinner table discussions about it, i remember her telling me that they were like 75 bucks a coin, so it was some time ago. 
She is really computer smart discussing coding and programming beyond her age, so this might be her "thing". But she is only 11, and I am just proud to see her doing really interesting stuff that challenges her.
@_date: 2014-02-06 05:27:46
oh my, thats incredible, she is so excited, she is dancing around the house and excited about her "investment" fund. She thanks this person who did this so much. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:28:06
coooooooool !
@_date: 2014-02-06 08:02:44
oh wow, thanks - i will tell her in the morning, she is asleep - getting a good nights rest before tomorrow project presentation
@_date: 2014-02-06 21:31:53
:) 
@_date: 2014-02-06 07:17:51
sorry, i am tired, its been a long day. I meant to say she is retyping it and will reprint the sheet for her board. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 06:26:07
i showed her how its dropping now a little and i told her about mt Gox issue (she knows they have been having problems) and I had told her about the peaks and lull in price bitcoin will have as it grows and normalizes. She is never gonna touch any of til college she says - yeah !
@_date: 2014-02-08 00:31:35
You are so correct, I can truly say that this reddit experience and all the positive communication and  knowledge she has gained has made her realize that there is a much bigger world out there. Being so far north in Alaska is a different lifestyle up here, and this has really sparked something in her ! 
@_date: 2014-02-08 07:35:49
she said thanks so much, all of you have got her so excited about cool people outside of alaska ! 
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:46:32
She is with me now - she says that is an excellent idea - she watched what happen last night with the slight drop possibly from mt gox and/or apple fiasco - and she bought a tiny bit when low (I am allowing her a little allowance each week for this) (she is a great kid and never asks for anything and has never got an allowance before now, oh lord) - she said she explained to people that went home and researched bitcoin after her presentation and came back to her today and questioned price drop.
She told them it was a normal, expected drop and it will stabilize. And she told them it's for long term investing ! She said thanks for the advice - she will add this to the presentation :) 
@_date: 2014-02-06 18:13:07
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:58:18
Oh you are wonderful sir/madam - we have done the history/how it developed and got her coins coming and info on miners and wallets to show the other kids and teachers - but the info u gave is excellent and we will add all of that - I can have my laptop setup and show transactions that way ! Thanks so much ! Once we get a all put together and the board complete I will post a picture in bitcoin for u all to see :) thanks again :) 
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:29:58
Hello fellow Fairbanks person ! Yep - that's where it will be presented at regional competition ! Sweeeeet ! 
@_date: 2014-02-06 07:18:28
i will let you know ! she will find out late tomorrow or friday
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:34:45
Okay I will check it out - thanks so much ! 
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:24:49
Thanks x a million she said. And she LOVES you guys/gals. She will save this all for college one day :) 
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:53:01
It's fabric from Joanne's fabric that has money printed on it - she wanted to make "bitcoin" fabric but that was not in the project budget - haha ! So she calls that money fabric her "fiat money fabric" in her speech ! Too cute 
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:00:26
UPDATE: She won her school competition and she is now going to district competition. Several others are going as well from her school too. I am so proud of her and thanks again r/bitcoin ! 
Here she is: 
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:04:45
They are not gonna let us come and see results until tomorrow morning is what I am hearing  - the judges are still in room (Alaska time, so only 3:00 p.m here) - she is on way home from school soon) - parents were not allowed to watch presentations, only judges - but she called me later and said "it went well" - I will know more soon - but probably won't know until morning results if judges don't finish soon. She sounded excited and happy, so glad for her :) 
@_date: 2014-02-09 02:27:26
thanks ! she is actually reading about dogecoins today and learning about other coins. Thanks so much she said !
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:54:34
Oh wow - I will make sure she knows right after school gets out. So nice of u - she is so excited about her presentation on bitcoins - thanks again for your generosity :) 
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:56:40
she will, she is my priority and i love her soooooo much !
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:25:33
thanks :) she is so excited to present tomorrow and "teach" the judges about bticoins. Go Bitcoin !
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:38:46
i commented :) excellent comments you put there by the way :)
@_date: 2014-01-30 07:28:38
Okay - yep ! Just her public address - thanks for the example - I am gonna do this with her account and do some more deposits and give it lots Activity. Thank you again :) 
@_date: 2014-02-07 01:38:12
hi ! thats my awesome daughter who did the Science Fair on Bitcoins and crypto currency. Kinda ironic that my little 11 year old used a MacBook Pro to mine tiny amounts of Bitcoins, research, and putting the pieces together for this project. She also used an iPhone to check progress, perform tasks, review, and monitor aspects of her little fun Bitcoin Science Fair project. 
But the most ironic aspect was that the first thing that she decided to buy with her Bitcoins was an iPad Air case for her iPad at overstock.
Oh apple, how would like me to explain all this to my 11 year old daughter ? kinda sad for her cause she loves apple products, but now she loves Bitcoins too :) 
@_date: 2014-02-06 04:28:37
oh good, she tried to do the things all of you suggested and it worked out like a champ - she understood it all and she is even mining on a little block erupter:)

I remember working on our new TRS 80 Radio Shack computers in my gifted class many many years. We thought we were so cool with our big 'ole floppy disks. hahaha
@_date: 2014-02-06 06:18:43
wow, thanks so much she said !! such awesome people making this sweet smart little girl smile !
@_date: 2014-02-07 00:20:41
uh oh, thats so true ! i should somehow send this to them. hahahahaha
@_date: 2014-02-07 19:24:19
I can promise you that her presentation was really good (she is only 11 years old) and the judges and all the people understand what Bitcoin really is and how it came about. It was hard for her to convey it in her 10 min presentation, but she included details about how it started, mining, using it - etc. etc. No one thinks Bitcoins are her idea. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 06:32:46
I noticed on coinbase u (maybe) could have a "website" take donations by them scanning her QR code and using an app to send bitcoin (I think that's what I am reading) - I could make a little website if needed. Just want it so maybe somebody with paypal or whatever can send her a buck and learn about bitcoins. Maybe can't be done unless they have a wallet. Thanks so much for ur time :) 
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:31:45
She said "thanks so much, I love reddit" - haha - she is smiling and dancing around the house. Thanks
@_date: 2014-02-07 21:19:14
I know ! She is so excited ! She seeded the address with .5 bitcoin from her own savings to start and then she has bought some small amounts a couple of times off coinbase and put it there too, but she is so grateful for r/bitcoins love ! I know she bought last night or this morning when price dropped - she told me over breakfast - she is allowed small amounts per week to invest if she chooses. I trust her. She loves you guys !

i was hunting grouse and had shot one, using a 1022 semi auto, went to shot another and the hill i was on collapsed and i fell about 30 feet with my 10 year old daughter, and my hand hit trigger and boom to my foot. I should have put the safety one, a big lesson.

@_date: 2013-05-07 03:47:51
I Love bitcoin and i am a woman. 
And i cook awesome sourdough bread, i am married to the hottest eskimo in Alaska, and i shot myself in the foot grouse hunting last fall.
