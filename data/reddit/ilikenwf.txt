If you could also consider hiring developers to contribute to efforts like  so we can have truly open source firmware for our devices, that's also a very very worthy cause.
Organizations that combat child exploitation, domestic abuse, and human trafficking would also be a wonderful thing to donate towards.

 is always a nice choice as they do great work backing up our history for all to enjoy, as is Project Gutenberg. Alternatively you could donate scanners and rare books, or just scans of rare books and other media, to such places.
On that same note perhaps found or join with a group and start a nonprofit dedicated to freeing the source code and use rights of abandonware and other things that should be public works by now...
Considered Convy of Hope? They generally respond to disaster faster than Red Cross ever has or does... 
Try and found a startup that finds new ways that are cost and environmentally effective for processing e-waste so it doesn't get into our water!
You can also go looking for schools, communities, cities, etc who are in need of things - IE libraries and schools needing computer labs or learning equipment...donating towards the fine arts is always nice since it seems only sports get funding these days.
Likewise efforts for computing privacy enhancements - the ME cleaner guy, people developing consumer RISC computing devices, etc - any of those backed by foundations?
Maybe donate towards MJ legalization efforts, at the least for epilepsy treatment?

Sell the BCH coins first, donate to cancer research or something?
