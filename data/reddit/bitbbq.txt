Every currency fluctuates in value, just popular currencies fluctuate much less.
But in the long term, every currency goes down. Bitcoin is going up. Adopt now, gain advantage over people who adopt later. Or just watch once in lifetime opportunity slip avay.

Why Tether failing will decrease bitcoin price? Tether users will be screwed though.
@_date: 2018-07-13 07:58:48
Well, if nobody did pay any BTC for real goods, bitcoin price would be zero today. And he probably rebought (or mined) BTC later anyway, so I would not call him short-sighted, I would call him pioneer.
@_date: 2018-07-13 08:56:36
It is not single usecase, but without it there will be no value. If nobody accepts BTC for good and services, why people will be willing to buy it with fiat?

I am afraid I cannot get your point. Are you saying bitcoins are casino chips?
@_date: 2018-07-13 09:24:55
Well, if you bought at 20k, you have a point. But if you bought at 1k or 0.1k, then you are taking profit spending now.
And if downtrend continues, you can still buy back at lower price regardless of when you bought it originally.
@_date: 2018-07-08 12:11:51
Because TA === BS
@_date: 2018-07-16 07:38:52
It comes down to your operations cost - electricity &amp; rent (if large scale). If your electricity is cheap, it still can be profitable.
You can still buy bitcoin with cash locally or via bank transfer p2p on localbitcoins, even if regulations are strict. Running mining operation is risky and easily detectable.
@_date: 2018-07-24 18:33:48
Now they have, before they did not. A lot of legacy software can send BCH to BTC address.

Lets be realistic: technical analysis does not work. At least with cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-04-14 09:22:58
Problem in node-voting systems is "sybil attack" - attacker can create many nodes to win majority. Nodes can be very cheap - for example, smartphones with malware or compromised servers (back in the day mining was done on CPUs). Mining on the other hand is easily detectable and burns physical asset - electricity.
Great discovery by Satoshi was that for miner it's more beneficial to mine honestly, if miner controls &lt;50% of hash power.
It makes more financial sense for miner to mine honestly then to cheat the system.
Another neat feature - the deeper you want to rewrite history, the more resources you need to spend. 
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:23:03
Yes, this is deliberate. More, it does not distinguish itself on the net and will connect to BTC node and (try to) exchange messages with it. Probable because it's network is not viable by itself and relies for sync up to the fork point on the BTC nodes.
@_date: 2018-04-22 18:24:22
Yes, but you can't verify randomness of your revealer zero. Should generate pair and print yourself (with transparent laser printer film pretty easy, then laminate for protection).
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:15:57
Value of altcoin is determined through market. LN BTC has the same value as on-chain BTC.

@_date: 2018-04-22 18:43:17
Well, just imagine this scenario: you are NSA (or other authority) and generate revealers deterministically from single seed. Then some authority raids someone and finds encrypted seed. They can scan it and do sweep over revealers to get seed and prove that person owns bitcoin account.
Another vector: you keep shipping addresses and sell them on black market along with services for decrypting seeds.
In both cases assumptions you need both encrypted seed and revealer to access bitcoins or prove ownership is broken.
@_date: 2018-04-13 10:54:02

No problem.
@_date: 2018-04-15 20:50:52
So how was it resolved?
@_date: 2018-04-16 18:59:39
Well, put "bitcoin accepted" logo on the first page then.
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:19:09
Yes, but not withdrawn to address C but signed with key corresponding to public key K. Yes, you can have transactions spendable only after time T.
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:45:18
or, you know, people will learn to check reputation and do not release crypto before fiat arrives, and do bigger deals in stages.
There were a lot of losses on centralized exchanges too, but it did not stop people from buying/selling.
In many cases I can get BTC at +-1% of market price (depends on mode of payment of course). But on exchange you have deposit/withdrawal/trade fees too.
@_date: 2018-04-15 21:24:56
You mean, like... get paid for work?
@_date: 2018-04-16 21:18:42
Can you add "total" counter?
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:03:02
Password &amp; password confirmation should be on the same page. Switch transactions/channels is not very noticeable/handy.
@_date: 2018-04-10 22:21:57
There is of course all of that - less trading, segwit, batching etc.
But another major contribution - people do not want to spend bitcoins now, waiting for it's value go to the moon in next months. Rather than buying Golf today, they want Lambo next year.
@_date: 2018-04-15 22:45:11
Re exchanges: meet p2p exchanges.
No stores? People will shop online in jurisdictions where it's legal. Or just move there. People move from country to country more and more, and countries compete for skilled and wealthy people.

Proof of work promotes cheapest sourced electricity use. Now cheapest electricity is from PV (photovoltaics, AKA solar panels).

You can open "channels" to multiple parties, and network can route you payments from one party to another. But currently you can no pay more than biggest of your channels at once.

What do you mean "ban them"? Cryptocurrencies are actually protocols, you can't "ban" them. Sure, some governments will ban accepting crypto or event owning them (knowing the key, how do you ban that or even prove?). But others will see opportunity for attracting investment and will welcome them. Maybe we will not need governments or even countries once we will have global currency?

You still own your BTC in LN channels. At any time you can close channel and settle on-chain. No other entity can spend them.
You can think of it as converting you gold bullion to gold sand, which is much easier to pay with (it was used as currency at the times of gold rush). You can re-melt it back to bullion.
@_date: 2018-04-15 23:40:10
You will be able to buy steam (amazon, etc) cards with bitcoin (as you can now).
Large fiat payments can be split up to reduce risk of fraud.

It's not the same. LN BTC is not pegged, it's the same BTC - you take if from the chain and lock into the channel. If you can create something with similar properties, allowing payment between parties without compromising ability to settle to bitcoin chain - yes, it will be same as LN.
Regarding Tether - you have to trust Tether Limited that you will be able to convert USDT to USD. With LN, you do not need to trust anyone (except devs, hardware and OS).

Bitcoin has smart contracts, but they are intentionally limited. Lightning is essentially built on Bitcoin's smart contracts.
There are some projects to bring turing-complete smart contracts to Bitcoin via sidechains. Most mature is RSK (rootstock).

Cryptosteel or similar backup solution.

New block was just mined.
It's random, deal with it.
@_date: 2018-04-23 23:12:26
Hm, try this with gold...
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:41:57
How much was the fee?
@_date: 2018-04-06 20:57:38
You can pay via lightning via Eclair Wallet (Android).
@_date: 2018-04-15 18:33:24
I think there are, but limits sucks (like $500/year).

at least with unencrypted seed I know it's unecrypted, and act accordingly. But I can rely on perfect security of one-time pad and do not use other means of protection (like passphrase).
Well, you never know - you can keep records and do not offer them for sale for a while, and as soon as your revenue goes down from competition you can cash out.
@_date: 2018-04-18 12:30:09
They will be from May 15. 
@_date: 2018-04-14 11:03:05
As soon as you buy something with crypto it is.
@_date: 2018-04-23 17:06:17
That's how Eclair Wallet works right now.

You mean "that" video? I had transaction failed once of twice, out of dozens. And as network grows and software matures, you will not see it anymore.
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:05:12
For opening channel you need one transaction. For closing you need another transaction. I do not know from where 3 transactions came.
And at some point Bitcoin will increase block size, but not before all other options are exhausted.

Exchanges can be p2p.
Exchanges are important for price discovery. How else will you price your goods in bitcoin?

You deal with unemployment by dealing with it's causes.
There is no such thing as "too big to fail". 
@_date: 2018-04-07 23:04:20
How big are fees?
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:25:54
Except it should really work. You do not want fire extinguisher that does not work in case of emergency.
@_date: 2018-04-08 22:09:32
Yes, like cash USD, account USD and card USD are separate markets.
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:11:38
Don't ask in Lambo dealersihp then. I think no one will target you even if you pay with bitcoin in grocery store.
@_date: 2018-04-13 19:00:16
Actually ASICS are ok. As time goes buy, mining will become more decentralized. Head from mining will be used for heating, and farms will be burning cheap energy from renewables.
Mining should be expensive and energy-intensive, making 51% attack improbable/too expensive.

Read user reviews and use your own judgement. You can try small at first.
I know some users were burned and even their amazon accounts blocked because they were sold stolen code, so use with caution.
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:11:15
Good tactic, spread the word.
@_date: 2018-04-17 18:34:47
Interesting, did he setup some scheme for his family to get his BTC?
@_date: 2018-04-10 17:18:07
I will not use until it's 3 percent, except in emergency.
@_date: 2018-04-17 20:56:54
One can argue it wasn't because of the failure of the GM, but because of the failure of the government.
@_date: 2018-04-21 14:01:04
How they are produced?
@_date: 2018-04-11 18:47:21
Trust maker of this coin they do not have copy of your private key? No, thanks.
@_date: 2018-04-16 00:36:56
Where is the logic? Why he can't worth a trillion"?
@_date: 2018-04-17 00:22:36
It looks like BCH is flatlining.
@_date: 2018-04-22 22:45:48
There is no harm in asking. You just letting them know that you want them to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-04-22 23:12:38
I think poster really meant once per establishment, not every time he/she shops.
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:06:18
"everyone" as in 0.000001% of global population?
@_date: 2018-04-22 16:43:39
 - already implemented lightning deposits/withdrawals
 - coming soon
