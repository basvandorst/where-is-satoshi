You're not doing anything novel here from the perspective of someone who would want to rip your code. That's not to say it's not a great app, but you're not solving a problem that is difficult to solve and couldn't easily be copied without your source.
Open it up. I would never install this app because I have no idea who you are, there's no trust. I'm not going to spend my time sniffing network traffic (and it's SSL, right?) when I could just use another app. Also, sniffing doesn't prove you're not doing something maliscious, it only proves it for the time I'm checking. Open it up.

What are you talking about?  Why is "legally" in quotes and what is the practical outcome of whatever out of context statute you're going to reference? They don't legally own your money, that's just nonsense.
Yes, banks can refuse cash payouts in severe circumstances. That does not mean your money has disappeared, it is still federally insured via FDIC up to 250k (you have &gt; 250k sitting in your savings account?), it just means that they do not have the cash and, if they paid everyone who wanted their balance, the bank would have zero liquidity. Even if that happened they would sell assets in order to pay out the cash, but it won't be immediate. Even after they pay out it is unlikely the bank itself would be insolvent (and don't forget about FDIC!)
The dangers of a bank run are far less than you seem to think. You're not George Bailey and your funds are perfectly safe in a bank. You don't seem to understand any of this at more than a superficial level.
Edit: your username... so you're, what; 14 years old? Time to learn to keep quiet about things you don't understand.

It's a criticism. He has also said to "stay away from it"

You people are nuts. You're getting your money back. Your fund in a bank are insured by the federal government. A bank is 100x safer than a crypto exchange. You say you live completely off of crypto, hope you have a backup plan for when your coin(s) of choice sink and you lose all of your money.  That's like having literally all of your cash in a commodity, how dumb is that?
Please let me know where you live so I can loot the silver bars you have stashed under your mattress.

True, but also Warren Buffet:

They essentially hold a monopoly in the PC gaming market and are a multi-billion dollar company. The decisions they make matter.
Keep telling yourself it doesn't matter and that you, couch potato reddit neckbeard guy, know better.  I mean, really; what's your argument? Why is it a bad decision? Which parts of their reasoning is wrong?

Right... 
Adoption as a speculative investment maybe, but certainly not a currency.

That's nice, but it still has a _looooong_ way to go, and with volatility like this it will simply never happen. Vendors get paid one moment and lose 10% on the deal the next. Non-starter.

Probably just not willing to help an immature, selfish asshole who got loaded and risked other people's lives.

If a currency isn't properly designed to address issues such as these then it's not a real currency to begin with (we all know BTC is far from "currency", but you get my point.)
BTC can be gamed by people with money. You don't want regulation, right? Well this is what you get.

Why would you pay off your house? Assuming you have a reasonable rate you'd be much better off investing that money in something safe. Hell, a CD would be better than paying off your mortgage.

You seem to have missed that bit
@_date: 2018-03-31 00:05:35
You still seem to miss the OP's point. His claim is that the people shorting it _are the same people who dumped money into it in order to raise the price_. They then take money out and the price falls.
