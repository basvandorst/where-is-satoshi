Two points define a line in geometry.  Assume that the line is defined by the function f.  So set your secret to be f(0) and draw a line passing through it.  Now publish:
Having just one of those isn't enough to solve for f(0), but having both is.  That's one way to do it.
If you want 3 of 5, then use a parabola, which is defined by 3 points, and publish 1,f(1), 2,f(2), 3,f(3)... 5,f(5).
To make it secure, you need to use modulo arithmetic.  If the line slides off the top end of the graph, it wraps around to the bottom edge.  Without this it would be possible for something with 1,f(1) to eliminate a few answers.
There are other methods, too.

If it got too large, couldn't you transfer all the different accounts into a new account and ditch the old keys?

Wasn't a scam. I had police at my door a month later telling me that they intercepted my goods. Got driven to the station and showed the package, which was camouflaged to look like books from Amazon. Grilled for a few hours. Eventually they let me go. That was a shitty day. Was paranoid for weeks after that. It's been a few years now, though, so I don't think on it.
They probably know what's up but what're they going to do? If you could put someone in jail for receiving a package, I would mail drugs to Donald and Hillary and cinch the election for Bernie.

You buy a seventh and then when the cops get you for buying an eighth, you show how they measured wrong and get off on the technicality!

My story: made a purchase on silk road back when btc was just a few bucks. The goods never arrived so I asked for half my money back and got that. Forgot about the btc after that until I read about them in the news. I have around 30btc. No biggie.
