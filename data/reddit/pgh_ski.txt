Ah, I actually did a "manual cross post" here haha. So you're posting in @_date: 2018-01-11 05:07:59
Wouldn't that first transaction (sending to the channel address) have to be confirmed though? Don't know much about LN that's just my intuition. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:18:26
I think that would likely be the case in that idea...Any sort of human-generated random passphrase would gave to be memorable for it to serve as a "brain address", and therefore easier to guess.

A lot of people on hate it, but I'm a huge fan of Bitcoin Cash. Definitely fits the criteria of being usable right now as a currency.
Of course I don't actually get to buy stuff with crypto that often...I have small amounts for trying out wallets, introducing others, and buying things when it's available as an option (I want to promote adoption!). Most of the time I use fiat cash and my debit card.
Just picking on you a little bit for promoting CC payments on a crypto sub:)

Is literally everything an attack on the network? All I ever hear from hardcore BTC only people is that *actually using Bitcoin* is an attack on the network.
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:09:03
I would rather promote crypto *currency* adoption than use a credit card to buy stuff...isn't that kind of the point?
Then again I guess a lot of people don't see Bitcoin as a currency anymore...
@_date: 2018-01-10 13:58:26


Which is a damn shame. Bitcoin should be for everyone, *especially* the poor with no access to banking.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:16:08
Since everyone else is giving the joke answers....NO! The seed words are used to derive your private keys and should always always be kept secret.
OP is rick rolling, haha. Those aren't his real seed words.

Ha! You read my mind. That video in particular inspired me to write several articles on proof of work as well as code a side project. It was a really well explained technical video.
He's an amazing guy, all around.
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:35:29
I'm a software engineer by trade, not working in crypto specifically. Just find the technology to be fascinating and want to learn more!
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:07:13
He's a great guy. The perfect blend of technologist and communicator. I have him to thank for most of what I know about cryptocurrency!
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:18:16
Cool, I looked and his website says he takes donations in other cryptos but doesn't specify any addresses. Might have to reach out somehow.
@_date: 2018-10-31 12:18:23
It's a truly incredible system. The technology behind its decentralization is fascinating...the cryptography, proof of work based consensus, all that. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:30:37
I only have $100 worth of bitcoin lol. I don't speculate I just use it to buy stuff.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:54:21
Absolutely. He could still be involved with bitcoin, even still hodl a good bit of that. Depends a lot on OP's risk tolerance. Mine is low when it comes to debt, I hate it haha.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:05:38
Totally makes sense and I think that's a very reasonable way to look at it!
The nice thing about cryptos is that it's a free marketplace, so we can have things like Bitcoin as more of a store of value, and things like Bitcoin Cash and Litecoin for people that want to use it for smaller purchases.
Going to be really neat to see how these things play out in the future. Scaling, use cases, and more...old on to your britches fellow crypto enthusiasts. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:04:22
I disagree. I think bitcoin is at its most interesting as a means of exchange, and a lot of its original value proposition comes from being a way to transfer value in a global, decentralized way.
I think the way to go is to use it for purchases or buy a little to hold for the long term. I don't care for all the risky investing people encourage around crypto. 
This is all just an opinion of course but I think it's worth sharing.
@_date: 2017-11-15 20:06:18
Did it cost $10 to buy a $3 coffee? Seems to me like Bitcoin Cash or Litecoin would be more usable in this space.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:56:04
Definitely depends on OP's tolerance for risk and attitude towards debt. Me personally, I hate debt so I'd get rid of it today if I could. But OP may be different.
It's also possible to take a split approach and use some to pay down debt and keep some bitcoin for the future.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:39:44
Also, if you don't mind me asking: besides the fact that community is going that way (seeing it as a digital store of value), what about bitcoin makes you think of it that way?
I can certainly see that decentralization and stable supply are useful properties of Bitcoin in that sense. Anything else I'm missing from that perspective?
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:07:32
Same, I only hold small amounts of BTC, BCH, and Litecoin for day to day use since I'm not in the financial position to try and make money with crypto. Thanks for the good discussion!
@_date: 2017-11-03 04:29:12
I might reconsider selling some of that. Don't speculate too much on the price of BTC when paying off debt is a guaranteed rate of return. 
Plus, there's a huge peace of mind and financial freedom that comes with being debt free!
Just my 0.02 mBTC.
@_date: 2019-04-01 00:56:18
Thats cool! What processor are you using? I know bitpay accepts BTC and BCH but didnt think they would process anything else. 
@_date: 2019-04-01 01:06:03
Shameless plug, if OP wants to explore how different parts of the system works I publish articles and videos at 
Everything is geared towards how the technology works and not price discussion/markets.
@_date: 2019-04-01 01:05:52
Andreas is responsible for a large chunk of what I know about Bitcoin. As a software engineer I've learned a ton about the inner workings from mastering bitcoin in particular.
@_date: 2019-04-01 00:53:55
Yep, the green logo is the most common for bitcoin cash. Usually it's rotated the other way as well. 
@_date: 2019-04-01 01:02:16
Fork propoganda, really? Bitcoin BTC stopped being useful as a currency and Bitcoin Cash fixed it. I don't think that's propoganda, it's a function of use cases.
Most people hold on to BTC hoping the price goes up and don't care much about transacting.
Most people like me that use BCH more often like to use it to buy things since that's what it is geared towards. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:21:10
I'm interested in the technology as a software engineer but haven't been in a financial position to buy a lot of bitcoin. 
You can always buy a small amount and buy something small, try different wallets, etc. 
That's what I did. I bought $50 or so worth a few years ago, bought a JavaScript book and pinged the rest around a few different wallets. Worth about $16 now and it's just cool to say I have some bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-09-17 02:10:08
Personally I'm most interested in Bitcoin for the technology, as a software engineer.
I bought $50 worth a few years ago (when 1 btc was worth $600 or so) and bought a JavaScript book and some vape juice. The remaining $1 or so I pinged around a few different wallets I wanted to try. It was so neat to actually see this fascinating new technology in action.
I could have bought more BTC, hodl'ed, and made some money. But, as a student then and fresh grad now I am not in a financial position to speculate with my future.
I'll leave the potential gains for the other folks here and just be fascinated with how freaking cool Bitcoin is.
@_date: 2017-10-07 18:10:51
Absolutely love Andreas' work. Got introduced to him through Joe Rogan's podcast, and I've listening to some of his talks on YouTube. 
A particular favorite of mine is his lecture on consensus algorithms, ie how the blockchain works. I left feeling a bit less dumb about how bitcoin actually works which is my biggest interest in the space. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:47:58
Absolutely! Have fun exploring what bitcoin is all about. Buy some stuff, try some wallets, or just keep it. I've never bought a large amount myself.
