I'm a college student with not exactly a ton of disposable income, so I utilize dollar cost averaging to make automatic small investments at the beginning of each week. I have recurring investments set up up via Coinbase and once it clears I just import it to Gdax and transfer it to my hardware wallet where I'm hodling. I'd recommend a similar strategy for you because I definitely don't think it's a waste of time. Continue to keep up with Bitcoin, educate yourself and I'm sure you'll agree with me.

Yes. Could be a wild night, I still think it could dip down a little further so stay posted
