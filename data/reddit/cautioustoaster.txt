These tokens are more like convertible debt. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:05:47
Ok true. What the coin would represent would be up to the contract/Bitfinex. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:54:04
Even if you are a US customer since they're located in Hong Kong the SEC/FINRA wouldn't have authority over them. Now how you are taxes on it would certainly be the IRS's business, if you declare it ;)
@_date: 2016-08-08 01:35:07
Ugh... god damn US regulations. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 19:55:25
No, like on a blockchain. 
@_date: 2016-08-11 01:44:44
It's not illegal to buy your own debt back on the secondary market. Governments and corporations alike do this.

1) BFX are denominated in USD based on the settlement time. 
2) Good question, hopefully. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:22:19
Thank you for being transparent and communicating with the community. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:27:27
Doubtful since they are based in Hong Kong. If they were US it would be a different story. I'm sure the SEC would disapprove haha. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:25:35
I hope BFX tokens will be tradable. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 16:28:13
Yep, counter party risk.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:47:47
sorry brotha may good fortune find you. Hopefully bitfinex is able to make good on client deposits. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:40:20
Why would you put your life savings into bitcoin let alone store everything on bitfinex?
@_date: 2019-07-01 15:33:33
You wish buddy!
@_date: 2015-12-13 01:09:39
Why do people, including this thread, always think volume numbers are fake? 
@_date: 2015-12-29 02:37:30
Would a shortage of space on a block really be that negative? It could weed out spam transactions and miners would probably make more money on higher fees. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 13:53:05
I'll look into it a bit more, thank you. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 13:11:29
Just because an exchange has 0 fees and the price isn't moving doesn't mean legitimate trades are not taking place. I think it would be very hard to inflate volume numbers because then you'd have traders clamoring about not receiving executions. 
@_date: 2015-12-13 13:15:09
By "always" I mean in every thread about liquidity at least one person comments that it's fake. But fake trading volume wasn't the issue with Gox...
@_date: 2015-06-11 13:10:46
It doesn't have anything to do with dirty coins because all transactions are published at the end of the day. The purpose of the dark pool is to not influence other market participants by showing large order on the order books. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 23:57:47
you think Litecoin and Dogecoin are fraudulent too?
@_date: 2014-12-30 15:24:07
My apologies, I appreciate the clarification. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 01:18:29
hmm I disagree, I think altcoins have their place in the crypto currency ecosystem. Although I believe Bitcoin will be dominant in the end, I see no reason to discourage people from using them. 
@_date: 2014-04-08 01:07:55
You're missing the point. Bitcoin serves as an amazing medium of exchange. The goal isn't to convert from USD to BTC and back and forth, its to keep, and use Bitcoin. I believe the Bitcoin economy will continue to grow, and look forward to using BTC to make purchases. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 05:56:14
22 and a veteran financial professional? I'm sorry but no. Veteran implies experience, and that is not something that can be gained in the few years you have worked in the finance industry. Experience is gained by observing the market over long periods of time. Although you may be successful in finance, veteran is a stretch. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 17:43:09
Even with the dogecar racing again, dogecoin price has not increased. 
@_date: 2014-05-18 20:31:36
I agree, the exposure could certainly lead to an increased demand for Doge in the future. 
explain yourself, downvotes.
@_date: 2014-05-07 00:04:03
The point of sponsoring the UFC fight is for publicity. The goal is to reach more people, make them aware of Bitcoin.

Where can I watch it?
@_date: 2014-10-12 19:53:20
I'll be honest... I would watch this if it were free, but have no desire to pay for it. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 01:28:50
Not true, they also serve different purposes from Bitcoin. They aren't get rich quick schemes. 
@_date: 2014-03-15 17:01:59
BRK.A ~180k
180k/300 BTC = $600/1 BTC. 
I'm sure BRK.A will grow at a modest rate in 2014, but I personally think bitcoin will grow at a faster rate. If BTC returns to $750 this bet is over. BRK.A would have to appreciate near 25% just to be even with BTC at $750. I personally wouldn't take this bet as i am bullish on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-05-04 22:11:30
Poor liquidity on the first day of trading, under 800 units. Egregiously wide BidxAsk, OTC markets was quoting $44 by $180. Hopefully as it gains more attention the bid ask narrows and volume picks up. 
**Edit:** For this exact reason, if you want to try to purchase GBTC, please NEVER use a market order. This security trades OTC, use LIMIT orders to define the maximum price you are willing to pay. 
Also you can get quotes here:

Why do fees go down when block size goes up? 
@_date: 2014-07-12 23:23:50
why do you think he is a fraud?
@_date: 2015-05-05 02:34:03
It's not necessarily bad to trade, but due to its nature it is advisable to be careful if you choose to trade it. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 02:19:29
You can't convince everyone not to trade it, so those that do should still exercise caution. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:56:02
You'd be surprised. 
@_date: 2015-05-06 17:06:09
No I'm not just referring to the risk of the underlying issuer, this is more an issue of illiquidity. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 16:43:10
I'm not surprised. GBTC is dangerous for retail investors. Your broker is just covering their own ass by not allowing you to trade it. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:13:09
I'm not trying to convince people not to buy it. I don't care what you do with your money, buy anything you please. What I am trying to do is provide best practices for those who intend to purchase GBTC. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 03:22:23
This is huge for Bitcoin because it means that we will have more reliable exchanges. I'm not saying licensing makes it good but that this will allow exchanges to operate and be run in the United States.
@_date: 2016-01-25 15:10:17
I agree that it's more useful if the price is stable, however to see 75% of my Bitcoin wealth destroyed would be devastating.  
@_date: 2016-01-23 23:32:39
You clearly don't own many Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-05-05 15:31:03
This only works if there is sufficient liquidity for GBTC. 
@_date: 2019-11-04 18:47:47
Do it, bet you won’t :)
@_date: 2016-06-27 00:37:00
So you're telling me that big block trades occur off exchange? Interesting how similar this is to equity markets. 
@_date: 2018-10-06 18:24:22
Am I the only one who thinks the plural of bitcoin is still just bitcoin, not bitcoins? 
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:10:37
That sucks but its the risk you take when you trade on their exchange. The current announcement states they'll give you another chance to cancel, so if you have any more remaining open orders remain vigilant. 
@_date: 2018-10-20 16:15:34
Nonsense, that’s how science progresses.

Maybe you're not the targeted audience. This is a succinct recap of what has been going on, best for someone who doesn't already intimately understand the situation. But I believe some people in this sub will find the article interesting, so I posted it for them. 
@_date: 2015-08-19 23:04:41
You didn't answer my question. 
@_date: 2015-08-20 11:16:27
That's exactly what I was trying to understand, thank you 
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:43:45
How does increasing fees facilitate more transactions per block?
@_date: 2019-06-24 00:35:24
Hey I posted this first!
@_date: 2019-04-19 14:44:25
Sorry I turn to the Bitcoin subreddit for meaning conversation about bitcoin, not lowest common denominator memes like this. Honestly the altcoin subs have far better discussions at this point.
@_date: 2019-04-19 14:02:20
This subreddit continues to disappoint with drivel like this.
@_date: 2015-08-17 03:32:38
Why do they prefer smaller block size limits?
@_date: 2016-02-15 19:45:36
Agreed, it's turned digital. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 18:14:28
There are other ways to avoid negative interest rates. Just use the 1000 bill. Or convert into another currency (USD, BTC, ect.. ). Or convert into Gold. Or use your digital cash to buy Walmart gift cards. Also bills aren't degrading because of this policy, that's always going to be a factor. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 18:29:31
I was just using Walmart as an example. Any gift card works. Even if you do not have access to Walmart, but have access to a market for Walmart gift cards, then the purpose serves the same function. These store credits do not have negative yields. $100 in Walmart cash is worth $100 a year later. As long as you can convert back to fiat then you can avoid negative interest rates. I bet if negative interest rates ever became more substantial than a couple basis points that markets for cash substitutes would become popular. 
@_date: 2016-02-15 17:26:00
Edit: Should have clarified which part is nonsense. Yes, the ECB is trying to move from paper to digital cash. No, this does not reduce the money supply thus accelerating negative interest rates. 
The point the author makes is complete nonsense. The purpose of removing the 500 note isn't to drastically reduce the money supply. It's not like existing 500s would instantly become worthless, there just wouldn't be any new one printed. Literally no one loses money in this situation.
@_date: 2017-09-23 22:57:26
I don't believe that Dimon's comments didn't actually had influence on the price, traders were mostly focused on China. Anyone who's taken time to understand Bitcoin knows it's not fraudulent and that the technology holds up. I doubt he himself even believes it to be fraud but is acting in the self interest of his bank. In fact, he went on the make a bullish case for Bitcoin later in the exact same statement, mentioning the value in escaping hyper inflation. But that doesn't fit into the narrative and our soundbite cutler.
@_date: 2015-11-04 04:30:42
Why is getting the coins off the exchanges so important?
@_date: 2015-10-02 16:09:07
If you measure stdev over the same period of time BTC (23.7) is less than SPX (29.67). 
@_date: 2015-10-03 15:14:34
Bitcoin is exchanged for cash hundreds of times per minute on exchanges, this is the process of price discovery. There is no price discovery for fallout 3, only a glut of supply.
@_date: 2015-10-02 13:51:12
To measure by month is no more or less arbitrary than to measure by year. What method do you suggest to measure change over time? 
@_date: 2015-10-03 15:10:06
They're not in the business of developing alt coins, they're saying the blockchain can be used to improve secure ledges for securities and transactions. 
@_date: 2015-10-02 14:33:15
Definitely agree with this point. Bitcoin has shown resilience in the past couple months
@_date: 2015-10-31 22:59:48
Well if he sticks with Bitstamp or Bitfinex liquidity should be ample. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:33:45
Unrealized losses are just as real as realized losses. This idea that you haven't lost anything until you cash out is false. Same goes for gains. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 16:05:51
Best explanation I've read so far, thank you. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 19:28:45
That's actually incorrect. If you are short a security you pay the dividend is spinoff.  
@_date: 2017-07-16 14:41:11
You have missed potential gains by not investing in Apple sure. The notion that "any" investment will yield a gain is a scary thought. There have even plenty of good companies that have failed. 
@_date: 2016-07-27 03:44:47
I've seen Scottrade go down. I've seen Optionshouse go down. I've seen TD have order routing issues. Believe it or not even major US brokers experience tech issues from time to time. Tech issues do not immediately mean that the exchange is fraudulent. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 12:47:29
Very interesting, thanks for the response. 
@_date: 2016-07-26 12:20:49
How does one do this?
@_date: 2016-07-26 12:21:35
So do you pay interest on deposits?
