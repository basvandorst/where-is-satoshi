Why does it seem like OP is being paid by the service to say all these things?
@_date: 2014-12-25 03:35:06
They cancelled my credit card order. No bitcoins involved.
@_date: 2014-01-05 17:33:14
Is it just me or did the op mean 2014?

But then the abacus manufacturers will want to "burn-in" their abacuses before they ship them, it will take a few months before you can buy one.

How is a linux vm going to protect you from viruses in the host OS(windows) being able to read any file including the linux virtual drive?
@_date: 2014-06-01 14:41:03
Assuming the fs is not that fragmented, all you have to do is scan the whole file for the wallet header, and then read stuff int he vicinity.

Don't do it! It was probably used in illegal transactions! Not worth the $0.25!
@_date: 2014-12-25 02:46:45
I had the same problem. I ended up paying via paypal given that  I had no bitcoins on hand.
@_date: 2014-08-03 01:34:35
Isn't one able to reflash the piece of code that shows the warning?
@_date: 2012-03-06 03:25:46
And I clicked that third last link as soon as i saw the price.
@_date: 2012-05-18 13:40:21
Where do you magically get referrals from?
@_date: 2012-11-06 17:05:55
So how would you give each person exactly one key for them to vote?
With bitcoin you can make as many wallets as you want therefore you can have as many transactions as you want(assuming 1 transaction/wallet).

[09:03] &lt;sipa&gt; ;;later tell gavinandresen &lt; amstan&gt; is gavin in here? there's a reddit iama request for him: 
@_date: 2011-06-18 01:58:53
I also had the same idea yesterday. I was asking for details about it on irc.
I eventually plan on developing such a device.
Do you guys think there will be a market for it?
@_date: 2011-12-01 15:57:30
I like how they cited wikipedia.
Wikipedia probably cites them.
@_date: 2011-12-06 15:24:50
They don't have a choice. It can't just be blocked.
@_date: 2011-07-10 01:39:30
Dream about what? loading thecomedynetwork.ca homepage?
@_date: 2011-07-06 15:25:30
Looks good
@_date: 2011-12-29 14:50:06
All they have to do is wait until most trades happen at 7. At this point a lot of people will have autobuying set for something lower that average, like 6.
By selling at that a significant price under the average one could monopolize all trades.

It was mostly a joke referring to the circlejerk that's been around in here.

Switzerland bans bitcoin, bitcoin users unaffected.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:42:30
I understand that. But if it's compromised and someone else has access to it too that you don't want. What could possibly be the use for it to stay in your wallet?
@_date: 2013-06-29 01:26:35
How do you go around the recent limits on micro transactions imposed in the bitcoin client?
@_date: 2013-12-08 22:10:51
Well.. get ready to buy when they do!
@_date: 2013-12-22 22:18:38
When did you clear your recycle bin? If it was a while ago it's probably gone.
@_date: 2013-07-23 14:12:18
How easy would this be to port to an mcu? I'm interested in making a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2013-12-30 22:18:38
Why is this still an issue? I thought this was done to death...
Just put it in the sidebar already.
@_date: 2013-05-23 18:44:43
Not really relevant but i'm too lazy to post anywhere else:
On this page:  there's a typo, "he's consent" is supposed to be "his consent".
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:23:59
So why bother the electrons in your computer to calculate that hash? Why bother even saying you have it?
@_date: 2013-09-22 19:59:55
How does offline "check writing" work without previous knowledge of the block chain? So how is an offline hardware wallet able to sign transactions without having the other input transactions?

Gavin is a trusted developer of bitcoin. He doesn't dictate what other people do. The project that he controls(github.com/bitcoin) is merely a suggestion for the miners. Whatever the majority of them decide to do is what will actually happen.
@_date: 2013-08-15 02:02:26
Why can't that money be used?
@_date: 2013-03-08 02:38:03
I never understood how manufacturers can design such stupid hardware that overheat when they're on full usage.
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:38:58
Why don't you use futureme.org right now to email yourself in the future to remind you about it?
@_date: 2013-08-29 16:07:16
This is useful: 
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:29:16
I guess a good reason to remove a wallet is if someone discovered the private key of that address and you don't want your wallet app to use that address anymore for mixing.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:21:40
I heard that this will be followed by a bitcoin miner implementation in labview. Stay tuned!
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:31:56
I'm not sure, maybe it doesn't get reused.
But it seems like a waste to have that address in the wallet when it's compromised.
Might not be the reason in op's situation but i'm just throwing ideas around.
@_date: 2013-03-26 23:21:50
That hash is useless, he can't even publish it. It's trivial to reverse it:

His ebook probably says "Get people to buy your ebook with $recursive_content in it.". I wouldn't even be mad if that were the case.
@_date: 2013-12-24 03:59:30
That's ridiculous! You would think the 3 squares are supposed to make the reader autodetect the orientation.
