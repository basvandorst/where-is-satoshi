Maybe they used Dual_EC_DRBG to generate their private keys?

Well, sooner or later, mining is going to be paid for by transaction fees, not the built-in block reward.  Maybe we'll see miners that come online only once the outstanding transaction fees make it profitable for them to do so.

Please use P2Pool.  Or, if not that, anything but DeepBit.  It's not very good to have so much of the hashing power of the network centralized in the hands of the pool operators.

Just so you know, the blockchain is about 2.0 GB right now.

TL;DR - Biometrics are like a weak password that you can't change.

The EFF's position is special, because they would likely want to intervene as an amicus curiae in a future Bitcoin case, and to do that, they can't be a party to that case.  Their reasoning really doesn't apply to anyone else.

Not possible unless the price of Bitcoins remains stable or declines.  Seriously, just pay your taxes.  It's not good for Bitcoin if it becomes known as a vehicle for tax evasion.

The server is sending an expired intermediate "StartCom Class 2 Primary Intermediate Server CA" certificate, but some Firefox versions have their own copy of a certificate for the same public key, but with a later expiry date.  Whoever is running en.bitcoin.it should update the intermediate CA certificate on the server.

What would actually happen is that the Bitcoin developers responsible, who aren't that hard to find in real life, would be held accountable through the legal system.

There's a really simple Python script here:
    git clone 
    cd bitcoin-mini-gen
    git submodule update --init
    ./bitcoin-mini-gen.py 
Outputs something like:
    Address:        1EYMUo1QYXq4VHSY82WExX69GGxE7e9ayq
    Privkey:        5JZKtqM1FnpoiegQ2sZ89MckJi6s3U2HfLGhf35hF7pewKNhiKT
    Privkey (hex):  61BA3109743DEF2E9801BC34A91A936D6D5B465F1ABE3F05121F8EFC2B27482B
    Privkey (mini): S27PbgCSF8KWWgGD5WGKDA5R1CnhaW
You only need to write down the ["Privkey (mini)"]( part, and the address.

I wonder if this had anything to do with it: [Full Disclosure: multiple critical vulnerabilities in sophos products](

Heh.  Pirate is not a Bitcoin core developer, as far as I know.  (God, I hope not.)

Nothing.  Also, nothing stops the thief from sending small amounts of "tainted" coins to anyone whose wallet he wants to poison.  It's a great DoS attack opportunity, which is why the idea of having "tainted coins" is a bad one.

It's still a password that you can't change.  The paper's response to the question about the "glass slipper" effect seems pretty naive.  There's absolutely no reason to believe that a single organization with its own readers couldn't create a database of millions biometric images.

That's a pretty long thread.  Mind linking to the actual post?

What about FBAR?
