There needs to be consensus, we all want what's best for Bitcoin both in confirming transactions and in profitability. 
From a mining perspective Bitcoin must inflate or break, however they know if they commit to a hardfork which could cause a price correction to &lt;$1K again which means mining will become very difficult and monopolised as running small rigs is already not profitable so they either desire market dominance however the risk to them is if confidence is completely lost no mining will be profitable as the difficulty requires the price to be this high or higher.

You think loosing 100% though litigation like mt got is better? I'm, no employee, I've even shared a video that explains to you why this socialised loss model is so interesting, you're just throwing toys out of the pram. If they 'robbed them' as you say why would they not just shut down the site and go insolvent, they could make all the USD into BTC and make it disappear overnight dumb dumb. The directors are not liable for a limited company, so the company would enter receivership and the courts would look for the assets and loose the trail in a blockchain tumble.
If you knew anything about bitcoin it's that any company that has your BTC in deposit can do what they want with it.
What they've done is one of the most commendable things a company could do and try to earn every penny back. I mean you complain but what solution do you suggest is better?

Yeah, you'll also have to find someone willing to sell a house for 1BTC that theoretically could drop to 0 before legals complete, unless there is a very stable price. Someone should open a test case and see if anyone will sell a property for the relevant amount of Bitcoin tho; would be very interesting legally. Although that really would force the government hand in legislation as you say.

Who can decide what is safe or not safe for Bitcoin? The division will create competition in the sector if BTC fails due to a messy divorce of the miners &amp; node operators ETH will be there to clean up.

The problem is trying the ETF in the US where the SEC can say that the exchanges are unregulated. Where Bitstamp provides a regulated exchange so the first registered security is already being set up in the European market via Caceis. The SEC is only one international regulator, when there is greater international precedent they will follow suit or fear loosing the market appreciation.

Thx. That's not exactly what I'm asking, I get generally in markets a rate rise in any nation causes a stock market lull (it's not always a crash) but it could be worse for any traditional investors. 
On past performance, have you noticed major swings leading up to FED rate change news and after i.e. The previous fed adjustment vs the EFT swings?
The larger market is irrelevant I know it will drop if the rate rise occurs, they can afford that. Bitcoin &lt;$1K again tho (risky as it'll create more hoarding &amp;amp; less reason for widespread adoption). 
@_date: 2017-03-12 22:35:59
Unless you make a deal with the seller to exchange the house for BTC, then as the property has sold as what the uk considers a 'single purchase voucher' the house is virtually worthless and it's like swapping it for a tin of tuna with the current regulation. No stamp duty, no tax, you haven't even any capital gains as it's not technically capital yet. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:22:50
The thing with BTC is if the chain breaks or if/when it [the price] gets stuck. Bitcoin can only inflate or die when it stops for too long the processing power used on it will be switched off as miners become less profitable. 
If it were to reach the 100K+ level we are also talking serious transaction fees which make widespread adoption impossible. 
It's a bit like trying to serve 5* meals at McDonald's pricing and speed; there's an inbuilt dilemma. (And I'm in BTC 100% which is hugely risky but the potential is also exponential)

It's probably safer than the bubbles across the alts; although there was little price correction after the fed decision, little correction after the SEC ruling. Most recently however the UK have now confirmed Brexit which means a weaker euro so we should have expected a rise to around $1300 but the scaling debate and hard fork is real, big holders are moving into ETH creating double digit% rises over a few hours.

Depends on your country of origin but if you want to link Bitcoin with your bank without using a formal exchange try uphold.com if you want to sell without any bank local bitcoins although that could take forever. 
@_date: 2017-03-12 23:46:04
You're right I don't know. I'm fairly certain (semantics) nevertheless in the UK when the base rate changes the FTSE usually drops (sometimes just slightly); also after certain announcements like tax on a lower capital gains threshold will most likely cause a drop in investment &amp; money to leave investments and be held in fiat.
Yet news and stories cause huge fluctuations in the BTC price for the day traders so I'm guessing a rush to 13/3 and a drop of the rate is up and a new price (hopefully) if no rate change. ��

How did they lie exactly? I think you'll find, I'd rather have 97% of my money back than 0 and so would most people with a brain.

Not really, bloody hell/heck is used for dismay, bloody good is used for something that's very good. Can be positive or negative depending on the verb. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:47:10
I think it just took some time. There was a fall after the news in U.K. Exchanges and today has been a negative price correction but if it's the fed or the scaling debate causing it is uncertain.

Uphold.com or Bitfinex.com

If you look at the market the price &amp; transaction volumes are at all time highs. Yeah alt coins will have their place but for now Bitcoin is king. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 07:54:30
Actually if these people waited until now their loss was 3% and even if they didn't believe the bitfinex team your can't see the bigger picture. 30%&lt;100% and customers that invested the tokens in Bitfinex it's self actually will be in profit from the end of the month by 20% in equity + RRT (I admit the rrts are most likely worthless) but many people have been reimbursed 100% or more. 
Do you even follow the story, it's an amazing way to deal with a potential company insolvency. Any chance you deny climate change, live in a cave and think the wold is flat? What you suggest is all customers loose 100% while a judge lets a receiver pay 90% of the remaining assets to the lawyers. Then you say people are idiots for thinking this plan was better; it's like laughing when people tell you the world is actually round. The rules can change and a company can pay people losses out of operating profits instead of saying 'sorry we're broke all your money is gone.' 
Bitcoin is not banking, if you want government protection, stick with a checking account and your pentagon backed dollars. 
I'm not saying losses are acceptable, but this is an exceptional way of dealing with it.  
@_date: 2017-03-14 00:39:06
Are you American by any chance? The law is different around the world ya know... And the joke about what you say; 'it's not about compensation' Is like saying well I know the other way is less ethical and more unfair on those involved but that's just how we do it because it's in law; fairness be damned. Like WTF? Have you heard of the red flag act where when automobiles first came out you needed a team and someone to wave a red flag ahead of the vehicle approaching. )(British Law) the vehicle was not allowed to go over 7mph. 
So law can be flawed and impractical, nevertheless law is restricted by the country it is created in unless there is an international convention, treaty or agreement in place. If you are referring specifically to the US people with money on margin lending deposit it's complex as with all investment there is risk of loss which is clear in the TOS I read. But again, why the heck would you argue for the people to loose more and gain less compensation? Would you like to go burn some witches someday?

This is because they attempted innovation and to allow clients to retain control of their private keys. This helps track transactions. They didn't lie, they said it was a mistake to remove the 'hotwallet' which is now back in place so a theft on such scale shouldn't happen again. 
Furthermore, there was a second issue with this multisig system where transactions were auto verified. 
There's been videos and hours of discussion on this, you seem a little sour, did you cash out your BFX @ 30c on the $?
@_date: 2017-03-16 17:21:51
Of course but so would an open comment from the core team that if BU gains significant support they'd berry the hatchet and help ensure the success of Bitcoin not fork and keep a core chain too.

Can you prove that ifinex stole anything? If they did to offer the BFX token, at a $1 exchange rate for class A (voting) shares in their company, they may well have just made company/consumer history. 
They may end up giving the people who lost 10x what they lost in an exit event, plus the recovery right tokens.

So did gay people in the 1950, slavery was also acceptable in law, is that okay with you? You have 2 real choices; either understand laws can be flawed or go back to your cave and turn off the internet. 
And 7 countries do not represent the world dude; read the law of the BVI or just watch the video I shared with you. ✌️️

BTC has very unique properties that other coins (even ETH) haven't and can never replicate. Predominantly the story and history of how it has reached a $20B market cap to date. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:42:15
It's happened tho, I looked last night at ETH was $32 I almost went in but thought as the fed hike didn't effect the price BTC will continue up and most other alt coins have hit all time highs. Perhaps if one of these has a problem we'll see a price rise, yet I'm worried. 
@_date: 2017-03-14 16:46:23
The proof of work on Bitcoin is superior at the moment. Most people see Blockchain, Bitcoin and cryptocurrency as synonymous. You also need another coin to reach the mass adoption, mining and nodes. Myspace would still exist if people didn't use bebo &amp; facebook. Although this is a little different as Bitcoin was the first mover so it's more like the www. Yeah ww2. could be faster but few people are on it. Another coin could eat bitcoins lunch but saying it's not got any advantage over others is foolhardy. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 06:17:37
Whatever happened caused a lot of USD withdrawals from those exchanges.

Not in the BVI, it's completely LEGAL. Plus if you compare it to what mtgox did, you'll find people have been reimbursed far greater. What you suggest would be the company enter liquidation and take all customer deposits to pay legal fees and enter insolvency. You have to be stupid to think that's a 'better' outcome. Get with the times dude.

This is wishful thinking as lots of the hoarders are now dumping for ETH. I'm hoping we're stable at 1200 but the scale debate and hardfork risk has created new instability.
