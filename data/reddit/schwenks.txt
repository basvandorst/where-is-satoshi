He mentions reddit several times in the interview, always nice to see when media personalities make an honest effort to become involved and understand the community.

Definitely some crossover features or aspects of the Liberty Dollar to be seen in the architecture of Bitcoin and the blockchain. 
Interesting interview and good luck with the documentary.

Sure, couldn't argue with that. Though this isn't something most people will experience.
More importantly, after becoming familiar with the underlying potential for innovation and expansion of the Bitcoin protocol, it's exciting to imagine the possibilities for disruption outside of finance.

I agree, a confident and measured voice in the Bitcoin world. I expect to see more interesting ventures comming from Mayer given his admirable track record. Nice interview.

He is right about the identity of Bitcoin's creator. The proof is in the code. Tethering a person or collective to Bitcoin wouldn't serve to better it, probably just to hinder.
There's a good use of historical examples which is not often discussed enough imo

That's an interesting segment, Wall Street must be paying very close attention to Bitcoin. Its massive spike in value alone would be enough to turn heads, and that is (imo) one of the least exciting aspects of Bitcoin.
