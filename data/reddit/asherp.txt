Trickle down or up are both bad interpretations of reality, because wealth is not a conserved quantity like mass or energy. For instance, wealth gets created whenever an honest trade occurs, because each party gains more than they give up.

We all have an unfair advantage over people who are probably more deserving by some standard. Or maybe you're just smarter than other people, but being born smart isn't morally supperior to being born rich. I choose not to believe everyone's an asshole just for being alive.

yes there will be some risk associated with having your coins on a sidechain. It will be prudent to keep most of your holdings on the main chain and use sidechain tokens if/when you need to. 
I think eventually a sidechain will have more security than the main chain, so more value will be stored there. Once the block reward runs out, the original chain won't be needed. 
@_date: 2015-06-15 19:54:51
I don't quite understand - how does mining on a sidechain reduce the incentive to mine on the main chain? And why would miners attack the main chain? Why not profit from mining tx fees on both?

I agree with this viewpoint, but you should also consider how this might apply to companies and governments: every agent is utterly replaceble, yet the thing lives on. These lifeforms compete for resources, some symbiotic (corporation and state) while others more directly, through war. Markets are evolving toward intelligence, from subservient to dominant species, and we are about to see them eat governments alive.

That's fantastic. It's refreshing to see that you didn't just issue your own coin to be run on this network, but use bitcoin as the incentive mechanism. In your paper you compare the approach to ethereum and you note that yours is also turing complete. Do you see any benefits to using Ethereum over Enigma in terms of scalability, ease of use, etc?
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:49:53


the concept of Gas in Ethereum.  Unlike Ethereum where every computation is run by every node,
in Enigma different nodes execute different parts of each computation and need to be compensated
according to their contribution, which is measured in rounds.  Recall that every function is reduced
to a circuit of addition and multiplication gates, each of which takes one or more rounds.  A node
participating in a computation is paid the weighted sum of the number of rounds it contributed to
and the operations it performed (addition, multiplication).


balance each node maintains.  A request will not go through unless the account balance is over a
minimum threshold.

As far as gaming is concerned, the sheep are the ones trying to game a pm, and the wolves (those with hidden information) follow the sheep. 
By the way, users can vote yes, no, or undecided if they believe a market is unethical. If there are enough of these, the market reverts to 50%. 
I understand the worry, though: completely unregulated pms are uncharted territory. I believe the public goods that will be generated from this will far exceed the public evils, but I have a lot more faith in humanity/markets than most.
Edit: there are a couple other implementations of truthcoin in the works, but the creators wish to remain anonymous, satoshi-style. I think they're afraid of the inevitable controversy.

How does he prevent other miners from doing the 2-way-peg? Can he really stop the transfer, or does he just delay it?


Yes, if demand for a SCBTC is greater than BTC, a market for trading between the two will emerge. If I want a SCBTC now and don't want to wait to convert some of my own, I'll buy it from anyone who wants to convert back from SCBTC. So even if the miner could prevent conversions, he still can't charge more than market price.

@_date: 2015-06-15 21:31:02
I think I've chilled out a lot about where bitcoin is going. I used to think that we have these incentives so carefully balanced that any changes would break what we have going. But I have a feeling that bitcoin is more robust than that. If sidechains don't happen, services will emerge to fill those needs anyway. I guess the only fundamental I believe in is the 21 M units.
@_date: 2015-06-07 00:56:30


The main thing I'm excited for is *conditional* unregulated PMs. These allow people to place bets on outcomes that *depend on other prediction markets.* For example, if a candidate bases their platform on the assertion that they can lower unemployment by enacting certain policies, then people who are confident one way or another can take a position on that outcome. The price of that outcome then reflects the probability of that policy being effective: "if Bob is elected, there is a 30% chance that unemployment will drop by &gt;1%. However, if Sally is elected, there is a 50% chance that unemployment will drop by &gt;1%" , which informs voters as to the merit of those campaign promises prior to the election. Candidates with promises that are unrealistic or damaging to the economy will not get elected. Instead of governments controlling markets through inane policies, prediction markets will start influencing policy on a global scale. 
There are a lot of other applications Paul has talked about, but something I've been puzzling over is the possibility of having PMs for everything, especially prices. Now, if the state of the economy is the set of all prices, this would imply that the economy is predicting and influencing *it's own state*. This is basically how an AI is supposed to work, which is absolutely mind boggling to me. It's like the market is becoming self-aware, with us humans acting as the neurons and prices as the signals in some enormous thought process. If the economy does become sentient, how would we know?
@_date: 2015-06-15 21:06:02

@_date: 2015-06-07 03:01:06
This is exactly what decentralized prediction markets give us. If the market's state is the set of all market prices,  the market will soon be able to anticipate its own state.

Taking the idea of security as a service to a whole new level. Edit: don't understand the downvotes, so I'll explain. The guy that took most of the funds discusses it on the forums [here]( He was running a script that looks for weak signatures, stole the funds before the bad guys did, and now he's trying to get info on the original holders to return them. People have suggested that Blockchain.info should contact him, since they already have the ability to prove ownership. Most likely, they'll compensate him for doing so. 
Basically, this guy has just created a new business model which actually counters what the bad guys are already doing.

Combine several read/writes into a single transaction to save on tx fees. Thoughts?

You are right. Counterparty can use open transactions to do high speed off chain trading. I guess I don't see what their value proposition is: if they are targeting wall street then you need to be off chain for speed anyway, in which case you can use colored coins and OT contracts. If they are targeting small businesses or developing countries then the price of issuance becomes a barrier to entry that grows with adoption.

Agree. But that's not why I brought up dogecoin: it's a community built entirely around a meme. Dogecoin did not require regulation for its adoption as a tipping method, yet its already rivaling the bitcoin tipping bots in volume.  


When I said "you cannot ban something everyone has" I was not referring to the present. 


The part in bold is where you misunderstand me. It is politically very hard to ban something *once it has already been widely adopted*. What I take issue with is your tacit assumption that the *only* way for something to be widely adopted is if it is first regulated and legitimized by the state. For example, when you said:


you're making an assumption that the price would be lower if Fincen hadn't done anything. For all we know, the price could have been higher, since the guidelines Fincen set do preclude several business models from operating.


Yes, this is indeed what happened. I'm saying we don't know what *would* have happened without it. You're assuming a top-down approach is the only feasible one, while I'm positing that a purely ground up approach - where everyone obtains some bitcoin through social tipping, for instance - could have also paved the way for businesses to adopt it. 


Charlie Shrem was advocating the same things last year. Now the system's turned on him, and he won't be the last CEO to be taken down under trumped up charges. Of course the major players want regulation - it's part of their business model to work directly with banks. That doesn't mean regulation is necessary for bitcoin to exist as a widely held commodity.


I really hope this is what the future holds, but if there's one thing I've learned from the past year of Snowden revelations it's never to bank on the benevolence of any state that insists on monitoring all of your activities. I agree that regulations are *currently* favorable to bitcoin, but after reading this [piece]( from a prominent economist I sincerely doubt the state will stand by while bitcoin becomes more and more anonymous. It will be demonized, but if we can get it into the hands of the majority it may not be criminalized.

I should have added that some also believe the economy can only function with the benevolent guidance of the state. People can believe whatever they want, and I don't blame them for acting accordingly.


Hey, thanks for making this personal. I've got a wife and two kids, a PhD in physics and I work at NASA, a government agency. So yeah, I'd say I have a lot to lose.
Not sure what you're on about that you make more money than I do. I could care less.


Again, I'm not asking you to stop paying your taxes. I do wonder if you've given any thought to what else your taxes fund, such as the ever-expanding surveillance state and wars without end.

It's a donation for people like me who's only interest is decentralization. Additionally, anyone who believes centralization is inevitable will take our side of the bet, since right now it's a "safe bet". This makes the pot much larger than it would be otherwise, amplifying the pay-off for bringing down the pools.
Edit* it's also not really a donation for bitcoin holders to take our side of the bet, because much of bitcoin's value to its investors comes from its level of decentralization. Because they have a vested interest in keeping it decentralized, the pay off may be worth it.

I agree they will make examples of prominent people in the bitcoin community, Charlie Shrem being one of them. My guess is that the results will be similar to the crack-down on illegal file sharing: they thre a few people under the bus but it didn't stop the tide.


The risks for using cash are different from bitcoin, at least in theory. You can't do multi-sig with cash. You can't travel with more than $10k. You can't support relatives in Mexico, etc. It will still be risky, but when combined with other ways of avoiding taxes it certainly compounds the problem.

.. and their customers can immediately flip their cash to replenish their BTC. 
Personally, I don't think it matters what both parties do after a trade is made with bitcoin: one party accepted it as a form of payment, the buyer sent btc, and the seller provided his product. Clearly, btc acts as medium of exchange for that transaction. Anything that may or may not happen in the future is irrelevant. It would be like saying the USD is not really a currency because after retailers receive it they immediately cash out in exchange for supplies.

I agree that bitcoin's mining alg does the job of balancing user and mining incentives. In your original comment you had said a permanent 50 BTC reward would be more profitable for them, but I was trying to say that's not the case or they would have switched. I thought you meant profitable in real value terms. Edit I see what you mean about other users not propagating the transactions, when I said fork I meant fork the code and effectively start a new altcoin. in any case my point is that this has nothing to do with the miners ideology: I believe when it comes time to choose, they will pick the version of Bitcoin with greatest return in real value.

Yes, and this is why those who *don't* want centralization need to offer you a financial incentive not to join a pool. We do that by betting that you'll stay in a pool. Basically, whatever we don't want miners to do, we bet that they *will* do it and this creates for them an incentive not to.


Yeah, but that's not what I meant, it's just what led me to the idea: I said if *any* pool has more than, say, %30 of the hashing power during some period of time, *regardless* of which pool it is, then the bet evaluates to TRUE. As a miner you would vote FALSE and keep switching to pools that are under %30. Does that make sense?

Stuff like this continues to amaze me, and really shows the life cycle of a bitcoin feature at work: developers come up with small modifications to the core protocol, which get torn up, tested, and eventually embedded in the miner software. Start-ups then race to take advantage of the changes so they can push out new features to their customers. Eventually it shows up as an app on my smartphone. 
It may seem like this stuff takes a long time to implement, but the wait is worth it. These changes aren't cosmetic, rather they create new modes of trade that have the power to affect people's daily lives. Anyway, nice job, Peter.

This opens up whole new classes of transaction types (from [mailing list](




ensure that all funds are kept in 2-of-2 multisig transaction outputs that
require the co-operation of both parties to spend. However, they recognise that
in exceptional circumstances such as either party getting "hit by a bus" they
need a backup plan to retrieve the funds. So they appoint their lawyer, Lenny,
to act as a third-party.


either Alice or Bob to steal the funds illegitimately. Equally Lenny may prefer
not to have immediate access to the funds to discourage bad actors from
attempting to get the secret keys from him by force. However with CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY the funds can be stored in scriptPubKeys of
the form &lt;code&gt;. At any time the funds can be spent ... After 3 months have passed Lenny and one of either Alice or Bob can spend the
funds with the following scriptSig:




the co-operation of both parties to spend the output. To ensure the failure of
one party does not result in the funds becoming lost refund transactions are
setup in advance using nLockTime. These refund transactions need to be created
interactively, and additionaly, are currently vulnerable to transaction
mutability. CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY can be used in these protocols, replacing the
interactive setup with a non-interactive setup, and additionally, making
transaction mutability a non-issue.




such that one keypair is controlled by the user, and the other keypair is
controlled by the service. To spend funds the user uses locally installed
wallet software that generates one of the required signatures, and then uses a
2nd-factor authentication method to authorize the service to create the second
SIGHASH_NONE signature that is locked until some time in the future and sends
the user that signature for storage. If the user needs to spend their funds and
the service is not available, they wait until the nLockTime expires.


signature for some or all of their transaction outputs. With
CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY rather than creating refund signatures on demand
scriptPubKeys of the following form are used instead &lt;code&gt;. Now the user is always able to spend their funds without the co-operation of
the service by waiting for the expiry time to be reached.




2-of-2 multisig, tx1, and then adjust a second transaction, tx2, that spends
the output of tx1 to payor and payee. Prior to publishing tx1 a refund
transaction is created, tx3, to ensure that should the payee vanish the payor
can get their deposit back. The process by which the refund transaction is
created is currently vulnerable to transaction mutability attacks, and
additionally, requires the payor to store the refund. Using the same
scriptPubKey from as in the Two-factor wallets example solves both these issues.




by first proving that an encrypted file contains the desired data, and secondly
crafting scriptPubKeys used for payment such that spending them reveals the
encryption keys to the data. However the existing implementation has a
significant flaw: the publisher can delay the release of the keys indefinitely.


with CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY the problem can be non-interactively solved using
scriptPubKeys of the following form &lt;code&gt;. The buyer of the data is now making a secure offer with an expiry time. If the
publisher fails to accept the offer before the expiry time is reached the buyer
can cancel the offer by spending the output.




variety of cryptographic protocols. Proving sacrifices of coins to mining fees
has been proposed as a ''universal public good'' to which the sacrifice could
be directed, rather than simply destroying the coins. However doing so is
non-trivial, and even the best existing technqiue - announce-commit sacrifices
- could encourage mining centralization. CHECKLOCKTIMEVERIFY can be used to
create outputs that are provably spendable by anyone (thus to mining fees
assuming miners behave optimally and rationally) but only at a time
sufficiently far into the future that large miners profitably can't sell the
sacrifices at a discount.

"The reserve amount is a fraction of the deposit amount". Agree so far? So what about the fraction of deposits *not* on reserve? That's what the bank loans out, but it is still less than the amount on deposit.

1. Where are you getting this? You can implement whatever you want as a sidechain - it doesn't even need to be a proof of work system. The only requirement is proof that the BTC backing it are locked away.
2. Did you not read the section on fraudulent transfers? You can design a sidechain such that transfer times depend on relative hashing power of the two chains, which would make stealing funds as cost-prohibitive as a 51% attack on Bitcoin.

Given that bitcoin is becoming more and more anonymous, I'm not so sure how effective the law will be at recovering funds.

According to what I quoted, you can set up a side chain such that transfer time scales with difficulty. So a 51% attack would raise the difficulty and force the transfer to rise. Meanwhile, the rest of the network catches up and invalidates  the double spend. I could be way off, of course.

Edit* To be clear: say a bank has D in deposits and lends out L in loans. You're saying Fractional reserve banking means L &gt; D.

In that case, the total money supply increases by 1/R assuming every bank's reserve ratio is R.

I agree that historically the use of force has been the strongest factor in achieving monopoly status over any industry, whether it's laws or drug distribution. There is one thing that has fundamentally changed - the ability to leverage math to solve problems that have been historically solved through force. I think bitcoin as a currency illustrates this in a powerful way. Silk Road's another example, though I don't know the extent to which violence was used on the production/supply side. There's also the internet, where control of information is becoming untenable. Fundamentally, it will come down to whether crypto can compete with violence. We'll just have to see how it plays out.

Isn't this one way to legitimately avoid capital gains/losses for daily transactions?
* use Last-in-first-out accounting
* pre-buy whatever bitcoin is necessary just prior to your next spend
You'll never realize a gain on daily purchases this way; it also has the nice side effect of not reducing your holdings. The only time you need to keep track of the price is when you're adding to your bitcoin savings or when you need to dip into them. In fact, you may want to keep a spending wallet which you prebuy/spend with, and a savings wallet in cold storage with different addresses for each deposit for subsequent accounting.
If everyone did this, we'd also see a huge reduction in volatility, because every bitcoin sell from a merchant would be matched with a prebuy from their customer.

This assumes that hashing power stays fixed. In theory, the amount of hashing energy poured in to a side chain should match the value added by it. Edit: the reason for this is transaction fees: as the block reward winds down, bitcoin mining is subsidized by tx fees - so mining on a side chain can theoretically be supported by tx fees, for the same reason we expect tx fee subsidies to work for bitcoin. Individual miners will flock to where they can earn the most from tx fees from users, and users will choose the chains with the most value to them. Ergo, mining power on a given chain should rise to match the value the chain adds to bitcoin.

The value proposition of an altcoin lies in the ability for its protocol to do something bitcoin can't do.

Tragedy of the commons refers to shared resources, which does not apply here because all the equipment is private - miners are not forced to rebroadcast each other's blocks. 


I'm not sure what you mean - the difficulty is unrelated to block size. There is a natural limit on the cost of inclusion due to the network's limited bandwidth. So if your block is too large, miners are less likely to retransmit it and your block could get orphaned.

This is what I mean - here you're waiving away a fundamental trait of what makes something property: the ability to transfer ownership.

If you had only one mining company with no competition, then sure you wouldn't need a blockchain. However, there are some asteroids so large that they contain more iron ore than has ever been mined in the history of humankind (and purer too), so there's *plenty* of room in space for competing mining companies to set up shop. So why would they use the same currency? Well, resupplying from a deep gravity well like Earth isn't cost effective, so they will *depend* on gathering resources from other asteroids to sustain operations. However, different mining companies will specialize in what minerals they can extract, since different asteroids are composed of different metals (with the heaviest orbiting closer to the sun). They will be forced to trade in order to get what they need, so they will need a universal currency.

tl;dr The block size is an artificial barrier that will result in a correspondingly artificial (higher) price on transactions relative to cost, while an unlimited block size lets the market determine the price, based on costs to miners' bandwidth. What will happen is that paying less will mean your transaction will take longer to process relative to paying more, because only the miners will the highest bandwidth will include your transaction in their block.

You could add a btc incentive without changing anything about the bitcoin protocol itself. As my business model, I could set up thousands of full nodes all over the world. As a customer, you would pay me a small fee to verify that a given transaction hasn't been double-spent. Competition for node fees increases the number of nodes and makes the network more resilient to ddos, while driving down the price of node fees to cost. Basically, the sender pays a tx fee to miners to process the transaction, while the receiver sends a fee to node operators to verify the transaction.

My guess: it takes time to convert btc onto a given sidechain, and the weaker the chain the longer it takes to convert. The devs could have already started several sidechains that expand bitcoin's features, moving their own btc onto them. When they announce their new sidechain, they can offer to trade for coins on the main chain for slightly above the 1-1 peg. Those who want to use the sidechain can either a) convert their own coins which could take weeks or 2) buy premined sidechain coins for a small fee.
@_date: 2014-04-22 19:40:17


I don't think this is true. Only bitcoin miners will be mining on the bitcoin blockchain. I'm no cryptographer, but as long as there is a way to 2-way peg bitcoin to safecoin, then the economics of farming safecoin won't change. Users would just be paying farmers with bitcoin-converted safecoins.
edit: note that Ethereum is in the exact same boat. they have an internal currency (ether) and a platform funded by premining.

The merchant could use the market rate and still offer a better deal than customers are getting from localbitcoins.

Well litecoin has faster confirmations and would be more robust against attacks if it had the same hashing power behind it. I think a litecoin side chain would do quite well. Quite sure scrypt is possible, since the only requirement is that the BTC value is reliably locked away. Edit: To use the silver/gold analogy, sidechains are more like alchemy. You could even implement Bitcoin as a Litecoin sidechain, so its shaping up to be a battle over digital scarcity itself.

He mentioned something about gold mining, and that content would never be destroyed but could be recovered by going to the bank. So I guess you would have an expanding set of virtual assets chasing a finite supply of money, which would lead to deflation.

If they took it a step further, they could use cryptographic signing to export assets for other games, which would be a win for the industry imo.

If the money supply is fixed, prices will only fall when the economy is already growing, so it doesn't make sense to put money into ventures with a lower return relative to the rest of the economy. Loans will slow down until the economy stops growing and eventually starts shrinking. At that point, prices rise and it makes sense to lend again. So a fixed supply produces a self-stabilizing effect instead of the boom/bust cycles we're accustomed to.

Instead of humans using the blockchain to trade goods, with a little seed capital goods would trade themselves.

There is an incentive, but it's not clear what value you're getting for the cost you're expending.

Scbtc is convertible 1-to-1 with btc, which is the whole point of a two-way peg.

For example, a user could query the blockchain for gavin andressen and see 10 profiles but only one of them is verified by twitter, facebook, and his government-issued state id.

Ok, reading up a bit it [looks like]( it depends on whether you're using First-in-first-out (FIFO) or Last-in-first-out (LIFO). In the LIFO case, you're taxed on the gains for the bitcoin you most recently purchased. In the FIFO case, the oldest coins get taxed first. So if you're using LIFO you essentially never pay capital gains, provided you Rebuy prior to making each purchase. I don't know if today's announcement requires you to use FIFO.
@_date: 2014-03-25 13:56:14
To be honest, if you're running a full node and not mining then you're doing it out of charity. If you don't think it's fair, please stop doing it. It's the same as running a Tor node in order to support user privacy, then complaining that no one is giving you money. 
Of course, there should be an incentive to run a full node, and that's exactly what Tor is now looking at. I think we'll see the same thing happen for bitcoin nodes, and you'll get your fair share.
tl;dr if you don't think it's fair now, stop doing it: better incentives are en route.

People like to pretend that taxes won't be an issue for bitcoin. The main reason people can't avoid paying taxes is that banks will turn you in if there is any suspicious activity. The more commerce is pushed out of the banking industry and into crypto finance, the harder it will be to catch tax evaders. Add the fact that audits are too costly to perform en mass, and the government has a serious revenue problem on its hands. Here we have a technology that gives everyone complete control over their wealth - how can that *not* affect the current tax regime?

While the idea of government has been around, individual governments are having shorter and shorter lifespans. They are also very different from days past due to changes in technology favoring decentralization. Just as the printing press moved sovereignty from the aristocracy to the majority, the internet may be moving sovereignty from the majority down to the individual. 


At the moment anarchy is unstable, because new governments are able to extract taxes and control the flow of wealth across borders. For example, if some warlord takes over a region, the people couldn't send money abroad for mercenaries to come in and displace them, so the mercenary market is too small to counter the natural regional monopoly enjoyed by governments. In theory, any technology that allows people to hide or transfer wealth should directly affect how much power a government can have and still be called a government.

I think the bitcoin community tends toward Austrian economics because it is the only theory that explains why bitcoin is taking off in such a fashion. For example, if the deflationary spiral argument were true, then why does bitcoin spending *increase* when the price spikes? Why are people spending precious bitcoin on startups and charities when keynesian economics says they're supposed to be "perpetually hoarding"? 
I think bitcoin puts a lot of core economic assumptions to the test while it affords one the opportunity to opt-out of monetary policy. 
By the way, do economists really think world-wide adoption of crypto-currencies would be the worst thing that could happen?

Sure, we can debate the merits of property rights if you want. The main difference I see is that there is no notion of implied consent with  property rights and certainly no moral claim being made. You don't stay off my lawn because of moral obligation, but because of the threat of violence if you don't. Personally, I think property is more like an amoral protocol. Like money, it can be used for good or evil. Property *rights* only come up in disputes when trying to persuade a more powerful third party. Anyway, social contract theory rests on the notion of implied consent, which I find immoral in this context: "Because you were born here, you implicitly consent to everything we demand of you."

There are a lot of things in the works to reduce volatility this year: 
* Automatic re-buy after purchase: this will allow bitcoiners to spend without reducing their holdings. It also allows every sell from a merchant to be offset with a buy from their customer. Matching buys and sells will reduce spreads and thus volatility.
* Futures on bitcoin price should reduce volatility significantly, and it will allow merchants to hedge against a drop in price.

Let me explain the different time scales involved for some hypothetical side chain. The idea is that this chain will have tokens that are pegged to the bitcoin. Converting a bitcoin to and from a side chain  token is what may take the longest, basically as a security measure similar to waiting 6 confirmations to consider a bitcoin payment verified. Once a token is considered verified, the transaction time on the side chain may be very fast, depending on the implementation. Alternatively, you can swap someone else's side chain token for your bitcoin, which is much faster than creating the token for yourself, but they will probably charge you for it.

It has its own chain and currency called ether, but its power is that its a turing-complete scripting language. This means users can issue programmable contracts that get stored on the blockchain.

There's a tacit assumption there -  I don't see how you can assert that one is necessarily the cause of the other. If we're seeing lower prices in one industry it could also mean that industry is just improving. 


My point is that (in theory) we could live in a world where prices change only *in response to* improvements in scalability, infrastructure, etc, in one or more sectors. But this would only be possible if we had a fixed supply in the currency. My thinking is that currency manipulation just obfuscates cause and effect.

I would argue that trade is the mark of a successful society, and it occurs in spite of government, not because of it. Governments cannot exist without taxing trade. Otoh, governments rise and fall yet the people live on. To answer your question, the best example of society without government is the internet itself, borderless and leaderless. That being said, show me a successful society that has no rape. If there are none, does that mean rape is a necessary part of a successful society?

A point about miner revenue: miners don't need to convert their transaction fees back to the main chain manually. In fact, it's more profitable if they sell their sidechain fees to those who want sidechain Bitcoin and are willing to pay a premium for them rather than wait to transfer their own. This sets up a market where the supply of BTC backed sidechain tokens matches the demand for them. A third unpegged token is unnecessary.

In the case where the shocks are not caused by government, they would say the economy needs to adapt on its own. The Austrians view historical events very differently. They would say that any intercession a central planner makes only exacerbates the problem, favoring over investment in some sectors and causing larger busts than would have occurred if they just did nothing. I would ask over there, since they would do a better job of explaining it than I.
I'm a physicist, not an economist. I only took one course in macro years ago in college and it was taught from a very mainstream perspective. I started looking at Austrian economics because I was trying to understand Bitcoin, and it was the only theory that accounted for why bitcoiners behave the way they do. For instance, they are investing and giving to charities when they should be hoarding.  They also spend more when the BTC price goes up. Also, the Austrian theories are just simpler, which is just how I prefer all my theories :)

I don't think bitcoin "was always property", simply because a rigorous definition of what qualifies as property is hard to come by in the first place. If your definition relies on possession then it's not obvious what possession means in the context of bitcoin, at least to me anyway. Ex. if two people have the private key to the same bitcoin wallet, is it now both of their property? If I publish the private key on some forum, is it everyone's property?

There are two threats to a sidechain. The one most critics are concerned about is stealing funds during a conversion onto the sidechain. This attack can be mitigated by making the transfer time a function of the relative hash rate.
The second attack is from irrational miners who would rather waste energy attacking a chain than gaining money by following the rules. I think the success of Bitcoin so far proves these people are few.

In the case of money stolen from your house, the police literally do nothing. With fraudulent credit cards you can usually get your money back. But yeah, I understand what you're getting at: that punitive damages are justified by the idea that property rights exist and therefore would extend naturally to bitcoin.


Agree totally, so I think it's important to first establish a definition for "property" in general and see if this is meaningful in the context of bitcoin. 
I hold a subjective view of property as any domain over which an actor is willing and able to exert control. With bitcoin, this means control over private keys. But with physical property, this *necessitates* the use of force. For example, if two actors claim that the same physical object or resource is their property, they are in a state of war until one side loses (in the case of theft or "appropriation", depending on how you look at it) or they negotiate a peace and the boundaries are re-drawn. 
The notion of property rights comes into play when one party is trying to persuade an arbitrator that the boundaries they've drawn should be honored, being very careful to choose a justification that the arbitrator *happens* to agree with. But at the end of the day, it's the arbitrator that enforces the boundaries - property rights are there to justify that choice.
Enter bitcoin and things get a little weird, because now the arbitrator has no ability to enforce the claimed property rights. Punitive damages (i.e. violence) are the only tools they have left. So when I say that "math renders the law useless" I mean that the law can't give me the justice that I want if their only solution is to lock someone in a rape cage for several years on my behalf. So I say screw property rights, I'd rather have better crypto.

Interesting developments in the Zerocash world, then. I wonder if their market cap will stack up to bitcoin's. 


The trust issue is why OT is going to be part of ethereum. Chris Odem has been working with them to make it happen. 
Ethereum is turing-complete, so I guess it's possible to implement zerocoin in it. But this illustrates why having a fixed fee structure in ethereum presents a problem: if it's cheaper to send a transaction on a separate zerocoin blockchain than run the same transaction through an ethereum contract, then people will do whatever saves them more money. This is the exact opposite of what the ethereum devs are hoping for.

This is not how a hedge works though. With a hedge, losses in one asset are supposed to be offest by gains in another. However, a 51% attack would shake confidence in both bitcoin and any other altcoin prone to the same kinds of attack. except it's worse for the altcoin, because the cost of pulling off an attack is a lot cheaper. 


I think this logic held before sidechains were possible, because the altcoins had fundamentals that were different from bitcoin.

Out of curiosity, instead of a Turing complete protocol, couldn't a basic Turing machine be built on top of colored coins? For example, you could have a deterministic wallet that defines a contiguous block of addresses (literally, bitcoin addresses). Reading, writing, and erasing would be analogous to spending a satoshi to or from that address. You could use colored coins to limit read and write permissions, so apps could share memory only if they have the right color.

Yes, I meant Bitcoin relies on the majority of miners acting rationally. This can extend to sidechains by choosing the conversion time to scale inversely with the relative hashing power of the two chains. For instance, if a sidechain has 1/thousandth the hashing power of the main chain, then it may take days before a coin transfered to or from it is considered valid. The hashing power required to steal from the sidechain can be as high as that required to perform a 51% on Bitcoin proper. At any rate, let's reserve judgment until they release actual code.

I don't see why. A sidechain only adds to Bitcoin's utility. Besides, they don't actually have to be public blockchains if that became an issue.

Hey, thanks for the detailed response. Merchants are already being set up with coinbase, which links to their bank account and automatically converts to fiat so there is no volatility risk. Merchants also offer cash back for debit cards in order to reduce their cash, but there is still the risk of fraud so they limit it to $50. Now, a person sending Bitcoin can't do it fraudulently, so merchants could raise their cash back limit at no additional cost. No insurance is needed. Why is this not competitive?

Stealth lets you publish a single payment address without revealing your transaction history. When combined with global identity such as OneName or Twister, you get the equivalent of a meat-space bank account. For example, I could send payments to  over twister without needing to know any of your bitcoin addresses: the wallet software handles all that mess in the background. That means no more QR codes, no more copy/pasting addresses. It's like what DNS does for IP addresses.

Yes, though if the market is forward-looking, it'll probably happen long before sidechains get implemented. 


No, you can't transfer existing altcoin assets into a bitcoin sidechain, else it would change the number of bitcoins in existence. You could have multiple assets existing on the same chain, though, which would facilitate decentralized trading.

They don't have to. All altcoins are open-source, so it would be almost trivial to copy an altcoin and release it as a bitcoin sidechain. If the features added by the sidechain have any value at all, then miners can profit from transaction fees.


Yes, they would love to. I would also love it if everyone mined asher-coin, but for some reason no one will. No matter what features I add to my coin, they can all get duplicated and my coins become relatively worthless.

So, there's a big difference between market-driven regulation and monopolistic regulation enforced by government.
Credit Card companies enjoy a monopolistic advantage in the market because of the high expenses inherent in meeting monopolistic regulation, which in turn allows them to have inflated fees. Increasing regulation makes it harder for startups to compete in any marketplace. Second, monetary policy encourages expansion of credit instead of savings, which drives more poor people into debt.


To an anarco-capitalist, drug cartels are more akin to government than they are to what we would call a company: they enjoy a regional monopoly of force which they use to extort their "citizens". Unlike government, they don't pretend they are doing you a favor when they rob you and use the proceeds to fund their war machine. 
Re: externalities: Capitalism does not mean there are no consequences. Rather, it means individuals have to bear the costs of enforcing their will on others instead of socializing that cost via taxes. 
Re: regulations The question isn't whether or not companies should be regulated, but whether such crucial regulation should come from a single largely inept organization at the cost of the unwilling. Would you support Americans secretly ordering drugs from Canada that aren't approved by the FDA? Ancaps believe that freedom should be up to the consumer, to choose the intersection of products they want from the regulating agencies they want.
You seem to believe that people are poor because some people are rich, that they have externalized the cost of being rich onto the poor. There is a certain class of individuals where I think that actually applies: scammers, professional thieves, and the like.
As far a I'm concerned, the allure of capitalism isn't meritocracy, since it's impossible to objectively say who deserves what and why. Rather, it's the only system that seems to reward cooperation via consent: for every honest trade, both parties value what the other has more than what they are giving up, creating a net increase in wealth from each party's perspective. The alternative, redistributing wealth from one to the other by force or trickery, creates no wealth regardless of the justification for doing so.

Im just learning, but id imagine instructions would be encoded as a bit sequence using deterministic wallets. For instance, the most basic instruction would be to check if three consecutive  addresses have a satoshi: 1,1,0 means write, shift down an address, halt.
Obviously it would be freaking slow, barring sidechain speedups, parallelizations through multisig, etc. But there may be some applications where a calculation needs to be done and witnessed by the blockchain, so tamper-proof memory would provide that.
Incidentally, I started thinking about this because of the recent paper on neural network Turing machines from DeepMind. Basically, by giving a neural network access to RAM, they can get massive improvements on performance. Theoretically, a similar thing may be happening with the economy: the system of trade is a neural network and money is the RAM.

There are two things we're discussing here: the legal definition of property and, more broadly, what defines property as a social construct. So, to be clear, I agree with everything you've said regarding the legal aspects of property and bitcoin's treatment as such. 
I'm more interested in the nature of property apart from the law, because the blockchain doesn't care about our laws. Also, when laws conflict with nature you get weird results, like people getting fined for copying mp3s, or thrown into solitary confinement for whistling into phones. 


What I'm suggesting is that property is more closely tied to changes in ownership rather than ownership itself. It's similar to how potential energy isn't observable, but changes in potential are. In the car example, the car is merely an object like any other. The title is a social construct that declares who is allowed to transfer ownership of the car. Indeed, when a car is purchased, the previous owner has to sign the title. Without this act, no one will enforce your property rights and your claim of ownership becomes meaningless. Ergo, the title is what makes the object someone's property. In the same way, bits of copper are not currency until they are used as a medium of exchange - a social construct used to transfer value.


Largely agree. The blockchain is data. bitcoin's algorithm is a mathematical construct used to extend the blockchain ledger by re-assigning ownership of tokens to keys. However, bitcoin holders don't even need to posses the data in order to spend bitcoin. In fact, the proof of ownership only comes into play when a) there is a transfer of ownership or b) you are proving you can transfer ownership. So, again, it's being property is part and parcel with the ability to transfer. If you break into my house and move my bitcoins, the blockchain says you own them.

I think it was sjura who brought up peace. Personally, I think war is inevitable whenever two parties claim ownership over the same thing.

Yeah, I have no idea how it's going to work in practice. I think of sidechains like products, where some cater to the masses and others have more niche markets. Every supplier (miner) will choose which products they want to "produce" to meet the needs of those customers. As long as people are willing to pay a tx fee on your sidechain, some subset of miners will compete to drive that price to just above the costs for including it.

Even *if* centralization is a bad thing, it could still be prevented with prediction markets. For instance, I could start a bet stating that no single pool will have more than %30 hashing power for some period following a certain date. This creates an economic incentive for miners to switch to the the smallest pools, since they can bet the opposite and only their actions affect the outcome. It also creates an incentive to DDOS the pools when they get too large, which would be reason enough not to join them in the first place.

In a deflationary economy with a fixed money supply, you only invest in ideas that you expect to have a higher rate of return than the deflation rate.

Search within r/austrian_economics for starters.  Basically, if the money supply is fixed then prices can only decrease when the economy is already growing. Without a central authority manipulating interest rates, investment slows down until the economy stops growing. Conversely, investment should increase when the economy contracts, because price inflation makes investment favorable to saving. So if the money supply is fixed a la Bitcoin, you would have a self stabilizing economy rather than boom and bust cycles.

If the block solve times are low enough (&lt;second) then your blocks get orphaned no matter how much computing power you have, so only devices in close proximity can contribute.
I wasn't thinking of using GPS at all. Instead, let every device merge mine with its nearest neighbors and ignore all devices that don't. If a new device shows up, its relative (not absolute) location can be approximated by having it merge mine with whichever devices it is nearby. 
To get absolute locations, you need more information. For instance, if I know where I am in the network (and a few others which I visited), then by proxy I know the locations of all devices relative to mine.

If governments tried to make up for the lost revenue in property taxes, the value of property would plummet. It becomes a liability instead of an asset.


Apparently, the UK already "loses" about £1 in every £8 of VAT due. According to wikipedia:


Bitcoin is becoming more and more anonymous, such that transactions are basically cash-in-hand, making it easy to understate sales. 
Perpetual auditing is not scalable, because they would have to recover from fines what they lose from taxes in aggregate + pay for the auditors and, more importantly, all the social services they're committed to.

Funny, I just had an argument with my dad about crypto contracts vs legal contracts - he has a law degree from Harvard. Maybe its like this with all lawyers, but he gets very defensive when discussing any kind of contract not backed by government. I think there are two opposing philosophical views here: the conservative view, based on the belief in the rule of law, is that a contract is legitimate if/when the laws of the land/courts say so. An alternative view is that a contract is a law that you consent to, while the laws of the land are not.

No problem - thank you for taking the time to answer.


Agree, but the cost of their activities is currently subsidized by government. The cost of doing it on their own would depend on the size and scope of the business, but it would show up in the price of their products. This means the consumer would only indirectly pay to secure the company's assets, and only for those companies whose products they want.
If you're interested in hearing some theories about how security, law, and regulation might work without government, David Friedman wrote the book on it and has a lot of lectures on youtube, but you can take all this with a grain of salt because no one really knows which business models will work.
Take Cigarettes, for example. The theory is that a person shopping would see many brands and several different regulating companies approving them. The regulating company's reputation depends on them doing a thorough job at regulating. (Being able to anonymously leak damning evidence in exchange for crypto-currency helps too.) However, the higher the cost of meeting a particular standard, the higher the price of the end product. So cheap cigarettes may be arguably worse for you than the more expensive brand, but no one's prohibiting you from buying either and you should seek the advice of your doctor in any case. The point is, the manufacturer isn't being honest out of benevolence, but rather because he can charge a higher price if he gets approval from the regulator.


I'll take your historical evidence of the evils of unregulated markets at face value and raise you the millions of dead at the hands of governments, both directly through war and indirectly through economic policy.


If we don't like corporations because they might become as bad as states, then how can we rely on the benevolence of states to suppress them? 
This is why I've stopped thinking of governments as representatives of people and instead as rights enforcement agencies that have a regional monopoly on the use of force and great PR. Think about it, if you wanted to create a startup that guaranteed your customers protection of life and liberty and whatever else is in your EULA, how would you do it? You would need some great PR, a lot of capital, and more importantly a lot of guns to kick out all the competition. Then you tell your customers that you can change the terms of the contract without their consent, that it applies to their children and their children for all time, and if they don't like it they can go to Somalia. At that point, you don't even need to make a profit to stay in business since you can just print your own money.
So, yeah, I don't think the state is an answer to problems within capitalism. It's an institution that grew out of it when the printing press made the idea of a sovereign monarch obsolete. In the same way, I think the internet makes the idea of a sovereign regional collective obsolete, replaced by the sovereign individual.

I've been mulling over something kinda weird lately, but hear me out: Markets already fit the common definition for artificial life; I'm wondering if artificial intelligence and general intelligence are the next step in their evolution, rather than something programmed by us? 
For example, we can think of trade as a metabolic process, where money acts as a store of energy to be converted to and from labor and materials. Price signals act as the mechanism for propagating information through an economy, which it then uses to reallocate resources more efficiently (think of the way price gauging during disasters increases the incentive for people to truck fuel in from outlying regions). 
What's interesting about the time we live in is that cryptocurrency could vastly increase the amount and frequency of trade in the global economy, that the number of market participants and trade between them becomes comparable to the number of neurons and synapses in the brain. At the same time, decentralized futures markets can allow the economy to anticipate changes in its state and allocate resources to meet them, which is starting to look a lot like planning. 
What do you think, Could markets become intelligent on their own? How would we know? Would this be a good thing?

Proof of location? I've been trying to work out a way to do that. The speed of light puts an upper limit on how far information can travel over a unit time, so there should be a way to triangulate a location based on the time it takes for a signal to be observable at that point. Come to think of it, that's basically how GPS works except that GPS can be spoofed. *Edit: this paper looks like it could help:

Thanks for the insight. One thing that concerns me is how to deal with the time dependence of risk. I guess the chance of a key being lost or hacked is really a time integration over a probability distribution function. So, as soon as you associate one key with Alice, the odds get worse over long periods of time. 
Eventually,  I'd like to set up a kind of endowment that pays out to my descendants, say 10% every thirty years. So I need some way of setting up the keys so that one generation can't just spend everything. The most responsible heirs need to always be given the most weight.

I agree that enforceability is one important aspect of a contract, but it is not the only one. Two parties can form a contract just to establish a record of intent, such as with a marriage, although maybe you wouldn't call that a contract. Perhaps a bigger  question is what gives that third party a legitimate right to enforce your contract? 
I think there is a distinction between legitimacy from a legal perspective and one from a moral perspective here. For instance, slave ownership used to be legitimate in a legal sense, but most would say those laws were illegitimate to begin with. Under whose law are they appealing to? So, yes I think a contract can be legitimate in a moral sense but not in a legal sense. In answer to my own question, the two parties should consent to the third party to enforce it, and if so I claim that the contract is legitimate in the eyes of all three parties.

This is the hope, but I think it's far from the truth. I once voted for a man who promised a new era of transparency and instead got the NSA up my ass. Maybe I misunderstood him. It seems to me that the most important issues aren't actually up for debate when it comes to election time, that instead the issues are chosen to divide and conquer us.


I'm saying that it is more efficient for me to give a man a dollar than to have that same dollar, obtained through taxes, squandard away by bureaucracy in the hopes that it reaches the same man.


I am saying that *if* I believed that participation in the political process actually yielded results in proportion to the effort extended (which is what this video attempts to debunk), then it is still not economically rational for people to do it, because they all get the same reward. A lobbyist's money, on the other hand, has a much greater pay off.


This does not mean I have to show consent for their rule through the act of voting. If I can show my lack of consent by abstaining from the political process, I will. Moreover, if I can support solutions to public problems with private means, a la bitcoin, I will. If I can help those less fortunate by building them a product they can afford, one that empowers them, I will. I may not be able to stop people who claim authority over me, but I can devote my resources into finding a better way.

Doesn't that depend on how many coins have been moved to the sidechain? A sidechain may be preferred for, say, faster confirmations, but they are more scarce than main chain bitcoin so you will have to buy them off someone or convert your own which will take time.

I agree entirely, but that is not what we were arguing. The question is whether the bank is allowed to lend *more* than they have on deposit. For example, if the total amount of deposits for customers is $100, are they allowed to lend out $200? No. They can only lend at most (1-reverve ratio)*$100, which is always less than $100. Since all the banks do this, we get a money multiplier effect, but it's not because banks are allowed to loan more money than they have. Their reserve ratios are mandated.

Ah yes, you can always contribute even more time and energy, but what do you get in return? You are helping them get into office and remain there, but how does this actually benefit you?
Let's take your argument at face value, that by supporting a particular candidate relates in some way to them meeting their campaign promises, and that your calls somehow get through to them to keep them honest. Now if I choose not to participate and rely instead of those more informed and civil minded to do the work for me, then I reap the same benefits you do by doing nothing. Participation in the political process is a public goods problem: I can benefit at the expense of the informed. If you are asking if I would rather be ruled by a majority of fools or a minority of informed individuals, I would say neither. 


Actually, you can change a lot of things by spending your time and energy actually helping people or producing something of value to them. If I want to feed a homeless man, do I spend an hour of my time campaigning for someone who gets him 5 cents on every dollar, or do I simply give him a dollar?

I think a potential application of embeddable mining chips is proof of location. Basically each chip could mine its own alt-chain with a ridiculously low block time, so low that you have to be nearby the device or your competing blocks will get orphaned. Then, Device B can prove it was close to device A by getting its blocks accepted into A's chain.

A lot of African countries already use digital currency in the form of cell phone credits, like the [M-Pesa]( Smart phones are on the rise there too, so conversion to and from BTC should be straight forward and won't require widespread infrastructure.

pretty awesome. my only criticism is that there isn't really competition from other block chains such as namecoin, since different block chains can be mined simultaneously. Also, namecoin serves a completely different purpose from bitcoin.
@_date: 2012-12-24 02:50:04


Both, actually. The bitcoin protocol rewards miners 25 bitcoins automatically for solving a block. This is how new bitcoins are created. A few weeks ago, it was 50 btc/block. Every four years the mining reward cuts in half, so that the total supply approaches 21 million. On top of the automatic reward, the miner who solved the block receives any transaction fees included in it.
@_date: 2012-11-16 21:51:05
As miners leave, the difficulty goes down while the reward stays the same. Basically the remaining miners' profits will go up and there will always be an economic incentive for someone to keep mining.

Not sure if you talked about this elsewhere, but I think one thing missing from the discussion is the concept of collateral. If I get a loan from a bank, i have to put something up for collateral in case I default. In the physical world we think of houses and cars as being collateral. In the digital world, these would be digital assets that can be confiscated by the lender instead of relying on the legal process of foreclosure. I'm thinking open-transactions here, but this could also be done with blockchain scripting. The end result is that you could never borrow more digital monies than you have digital assets backing them.

If anyone's looking for it, [here's the paper]( that explains the study. Abstract:


to test the validity of the assumption that diﬀerent random choices are made each time keys are 
generated. We found that the vast ma jority of public keys work as intended. A more disconcerting 
ﬁnding is that two out of every one thousand RSA moduli that we collected oﬀer no security. 
Our conclusion is that the validity of the assumption is questionable and that generating keys 
in the real world for “multiple-secrets” cryptosystems such as RSA is signiﬁcantly riskier than 
for “single-secret” ones such as ElGamal or (EC)DSA which are based on Diﬃe-Hellman.

My rough understanding: there is an in-game currency (diamonds) that you can mine and exchange for goods, but people are allowed to steal it from each other in-game, which creates an economy around hiding/protecting it in some secret place (Columbia?). Somehow this is to test different economic ideologies. However, the bitcoin-diamond trade gives people a "safe" outside the game world, which subverts the presumed fairness of the in-game system?

Every time you work with someone, you sign off on the success of the venture with your public key. Someone with a lot of signatures might be worth investing in, since cheating their next customer ruins their reputation.

It might take a while to gain enough of a reputation to get a huge loan, but a system like this would get savvy entrepreneurs to the top.

Denise Howell sounded pretty positive, but it was cool to see how the others reacted too. Evan Brown made a point that I haven't heard before: instead of outlawing bitcoin altogether in the US, states or the federal government could say that contracts that stipulate bitcoin as payment for services rendered could be voided. This means you wouldn't be able to sue someone if they broke their contractual obligations. If I understand him correctly, the law would have to be passed before the contracts are made, which means the legislature would have to act quickly. On the other hand, it's possible that the government's role in contracts could be replaced by alternatives, such as anonymous reputation systems like bitcoin-otc or the Global Bitcoin Stock Exchange. Essentially, if they try to restrain us, we will adapt.

See the bitcoin paper, section 6 on Incentives.
We know there is incentive to mine because miners are rewarded with 50 BTC every 10 minutes. However, the mining is really there to secure the block chain. Once no more bitcoins are mined, the incentive to mine comes from the transaction fees. 
As the difficulty increases, the cost of mining increases, and this is built into the protocol. With current hardware, 2.5 Megahashes cost 1 Joule of electricity. Difficulty will always increase until the number of hashes required per bitcoin is slightly less than cost of electricity to produce them, which is the break-even point for mining. 
The modern world runs everything on electricity, but there are no other currencies that have a finite and consistent electrical cost to produce them. With fiat currencies, the energy required to produce them is negligible to their value, so governments have incentive to print them. With bitcoin, their production cost will always be tied to the cost in electricity, such that mining profitability increases when new forms of power are discovered. A new technology that allows us to more efficiently mine gold will not improve the economy. On the other hand, a technology that allows us to get cheaper electricity is good for the economy, so it makes sense that a currency should be tied to that.


It is interesting to look at how the USD, the Joule, and BTC are now linked: 
The current hash rate of the bitcoin network is 13.4e12 hash/sec. Dividing by the mining efficiency (1.5e6 hash/J) yields 8.93e6 Watts of electricity, which are spent in total looking for bitcoins. By design, 50 BTC are given out every 600 seconds, so right now 
1 BTC costs (8.93e6 J/s * 600s/50) 1.07e8 Joules to make. If you live in the residential US, electricity costs 11 cents/kWh, which means 1USD buys you 3.27e9 Joules. Finally, the BTC to USD exchange rate is hovering around $10/BTC.
So just in terms of electricity, the three really are linked in a concrete way. 1 USD spent -&gt; 3.27e9 Joules -&gt; 30.56 BTC -&gt; $305 USD, which makes mining theoretically profitable. I think eventually, you'll be paying your electric bill in BTC, while you can always earn BTC by spending electricity. At that point, BTC will ultimately be backed by the Joule.


I don't know if BTC will eventually be hacked and some other protocol will take over. The important thing is that the idea is out there: having an easily-transferable currency inherently tied to energy independent of where it comes from is what counts.

A "massive Zimbabwe-style inflation" would be if someone was able to generate an arbitrary number of bitcoins and get them accepted by the network as legitimate. This is just regular inflation, not Zimbabwe-style inflation. But thanks for the insight, Redditor For 12 Minutes.

Last night was the first time I've bought bitcoins (or invested *anything* that didn't involve an exchange of goods for that matter). My asking price was $6.2/BTC, which at the time was a lot lower than what I should have bid if I expected to get any. I can only tell you why I chose the price I did: 1)  said the price wasn't likely to rise and he turned out to be right. 2) Investing at a lower price reduces my risk. That being said, I'm hoping it'll rise again due to all the press it's getting these days.

This [thread]( discusses how to choose a random person from a p2p network. 


The players would first agree on a deck before the deck is shuffled. Each card could be represented by any piece of data - a picture of a cow from a particular website could represent the queen of hearts, for example. Alternatively, whoever builds this thing could publish some recommended decks. If you don't accept the deck, don't buy in. (You then have to agree on a commutative encryption algorithm, but the client should choose one by default.) If you can't decrypt your cards, then obviously someone sent the wrong data. Any money you have tied to those cards should be returned to you after a certain amount of time has passed, and it looks like bitcoin's contracts features allow this.


Hmm I'm not sure exactly what we're talking about then. Do you mean non-human players? Please understand I'd really like to see this thing built myself, so I'd like to know exactly what's missing from the architecture.

I find it strange that these articles always mention drugs and gambling as the best uses, but they consistently leave out porn*. Apparently, the porn industry loses a lot of revenue to fraudulent charges from their own customers - since traditional payment schemes lack anonymity, people don't want to own up to what they've already paid for.

Thanks for the detailed response! I suppose the difference between a virtual currency and a virtual good is that I don't need to prove ownership in order to use my brand new ThorHammer at home. For something like a MMO, it might be more useful. maybe new games would require authentication for each asset, and only honest nodes would be able to communicate. Assuming that works, DLC would be more streamlined - you could literally pay as you go (buying the content as you explore).

Actually, there are already "folding pools" of a different sort used by the [Fold.IT]( community. Instead of doing brute-force, they are folding proteins by hand (and at faster rates). Some are better going solo, but folding teams often work on the same protein together, each person contributing insights that might lead to a better solution. At any rate, finding more efficient ways to fold, whether by some brute-force or human-guided approach, is what we want. If you offer a financial incentive for that service, and people end up "exploiting" it by curing cancer, then by all means let them!

I would argue that the music world is already like this. I can't tell you how many times I've heard someone say "I was into that band before they got big" or "my taste in music is sooo obscure you've probably never heard the music I'm into". The system I'm proposing is just a way of formalizing this - a way for people to support artists by promoting work they think is valuable. In this model, everyone pays what they think the song is worth, whether it's 1 BTC or .0001 BTC. At the end of the day, the artist gets paid and that's what counts IMO.

They can still correlate your spending even if you try to obfuscate it through multiple addresses. however, if you transfer through a bitcoin laundering site then the direct links are broken.
@_date: 2011-05-22 05:31:54
I think the problems occur when you try to eventually spend the money. Say you took 100 BTC from a given address and dispersed it to 100 new addresses. In order to buy something, a retailer would issue you a bitcoin address into which you make payments. All the coins you dispersed would pay into the same address, so an observant auditor could infer that the purchase came from your original address. I don't fully understand how the laundry service works, but basically someone has fronted a lot of BTC (~1000's). When you transfer your coins to the retailer, they first get sent to the intermediary pool, which then pays out to the target address using one of its own addresses over time. This way, no direct link exists between your address and the target address. The more people use the pool, the more difficult it is to make correlations.

I've been in the space physics field for 7 years and my PhD thesis is on a certain simulation of the Earth's magnetic field in response to solar activity. What the OP is referring to is a definite possibility: if there were another storm like the one in 1858 we would lose the whole power grid and pretty much all communication satellites for a while. While a lot of people are worried about it, it's hard to plan for something that's never happened (especially if making preparations is expensive). More to the point, it's interesting to consider what would happen to the internet and, by extension, the block chain:
High-energy particles will wreak havoc on data centers, so if you're going to store your encrypted wallet in the cloud then be sure to put it in as many places as possible. the block chain will survive in pieces, since exchanges can still be made locally. However, when you reconnect them you have to decide which of the new coins are valid, which could be bad. There was a [thread]( on the bitcoin forums that discusses this. BTW, a new internet based on [mesh networking]( could help the situation immensely.
tl;dr In the event of the apocalypse, bitcoin will survive!

I may be in my own bubble here (I've probably read every article being written about it these last few weeks), but I think the public image of bitcoin is kindof not-so-important right now. By its very nature bitcoin is complex and, yes, lay persons will stay away due to all the FUD written about it. This means only people who take the time to learn a few things about crypto and such will be smart enough to buy some before the rest of the world realizes what's happening. The fact that the bulk of the world's computing power has moved over to solving bitcoin problems is evidence enough of its lasting appeal. It's as though the internet is rewarding all the geeks for their years of quiet service with boatloads of cash...

Again, here is the [solution]( and the [code]( that implements it. This was a very active area of research about ten years ago. No trust is needed, and collusion can be practically eliminated by randomly choosing the players from the network.

 * Build a p2p-poker system (see r/crypto) and we can start gambling for bitcoin. If it's built with no rake, then it's legal in most places.
 * Game development using crowd-sourced funding. Designer comes up with an idea, sells shares on GBSE, employs artists/developers with bitcoin. Makes game. Sells game for bitcoin. Sends dividends to investors.

I think the problem is that the Venn diagram does not distinguish between all the people who understand the technology and those who end up using it. Satoshi himself clearly understood cryptography (math), currency, and investment, which is why bitcoin exists at all. 
@_date: 2011-05-20 02:30:12
Let me explain: the way bitcoins are transferred from one owner to the next is by verifying the chain of ownership all the way up to the first owner. The same can be done with any piece of data. For instance, a band like Radiohead could "release" their next song by posting it as the genesis block on the market (for a very high price). This "original" song can then be transferred from one owner to the next just as bitcoins are (or any original work of art). The only difference would be that each owner would be able to spawn subsequent generations of the song: ideally, the protocol should insure that exactly two copies exist for the second print (for half the price), while the third print has four copies, etc. This way the number of "legit" copies expands geometrically at lower and lower prices. There is no incentive to torrent your version because yours is unique and will appreciate in value if you don't. Fans will want to buy earlier generations, while others can buy later generations for a reduced price.

Yes, it can work, especially with all the crazy things you can do with bitcoin [contracts]( It all depends on the way you transfer bitcoins. For instance, you can "partially transfer" coins to a bank who holds them in reserve for you, but you can do this in a way that forces them to only send the coins back to you. This prevents the bank from lending out your coins, while at the same time benefiting from their added security. I'm guessing each customer would set the fraction of their savings that the bank can loan out.

Bitcoins are what they call pseudo-anonymous ("pseudonymous") in that ownership is purely dependent on who owns a particular coin's private key and isn't directly tied to one's identity. It's relatively easy to keep track of individual coins in the same way that you could mark a dollar bill. However, it's just as easy to launder them using a service like [bitcoinlaundry]( which mixes up people's money so that sender and receiver connections are broken. Any service that has multiple users can act as a mixing service - for example, the global bitcoin stock exchange (GLBSE) will give you other people's coins if you make a withdrawal. For this reason, bitcoins don't really need to be purely anonymous on their own.

The reason I would pay in BTC: the prices are *lower.* Why would a merchant charge the same price for mastercard when there is an alternative that incurs negligible transaction fees? It's the same reason many vendors don't take American Express, the reason you have to spend at least $5 to pay with a credit card in most places. Therefore, if a vendor accepts both forms of payment, then they could lower the price if the customer pays in bitcoin and *still* make a higher profit relative to credit cards.

It seems like the sort of thing missionaries would get into. Basically you'd go into a village and teach someone how to set up a bitcoin wallet. Then record a video documenting how they plan to invest their donations, perhaps with someone holding up a sign with the village bitcoin address written on it. Any funds that get sent to the wallet could be taken to the local exchanger and traded for cash, which in turn is used to buy farming equipment, hire teachers, build wells, buy raw materials for making clothes, etc. There just needs to be good documentation of the project so people know where their money's going.

I couldn't agree more. The implementation of anonymous trust systems is already under development. This is basically how systems like eBay work. I'd imagine you could put up assets on the GLBSE as leverage. If you used your public keys to sign off on all your e-commerce activity, then you could use your reputation as your line of credit.

Basically the site administrator has a lot of bitcoins in reserve. When you send bitcoins to the site, it sends new coins from a different address in its reserve.

For those who don't know him, Krugman subscribes to the Keynesian economic theory (as do most economists), wherein it is assumed that deflationary currencies are bad because they promote "hoarding". Hoarding is when you save your income instead of spending it on the things society tells you to spend it on. Hoarding isn't a problem with inflationary currencies because savings are automatically discouraged due to the devaluation of your money over time. Again, I highly recommend the recent Keynes vs Hayek BBC [debate]( which pretty well represents both views.

Think about China for the moment: we have an entire nation of people paying for bootlegged versions of western media. It's not that the Chinese don't like to pay for things - they simply aren't able to buy them in their own currency for an affordable price.

I believe you are *underestimating* the intelligence of most people. The criminal world is moving toward bitcoin because they are smarter than the rest of society (that's how they make a living).

fyi the whole point of quantum computing is that it is inherently parallel. Last I heard, researchers were able to factor the number 15 into the prime numbers 5 and 3, which is a major first step but not enough to break Sha-256. If the D-wave really is a quantum computer (and there are lots of [skeptics]( who say otherwise) then it could be used to crack almost any cryptographic scheme, not just bitcoin's. Such an ability would be worth more than the market value of bitcoin today.

We should note that Counterparty also has drawbacks relative to colored coins, too. 
* asset issuance on counterparty requires you to buy XCP, whereas colored coin assets are issued at the cost of a bitcoin transaction.
* a counterparty buy/sell order can't be revoked once its been transmitted to the blockchain. Colored coin trading isn't decentralized, but it can be done almost instantly peer-to-peer

We had scientists, hackers, some guy who traveled cross-country on bitcoin only, finance guys, entrepreneurs, a dude from a big-name consultancy, and a guy that collects bitcoins for charities.  At the start of the meeting we discussed all the news since the last meeting, and inevitably China came up. The guy hosting the meeting started talking about how this means it's a good time to buy. I was more interested in *why* is China allowing bitcoin to thrive while the US seems more restrictive, and what followed was a lively side discussion about states vying for economic power, even contradicting themselves as factions within the government have different goals.

It is said that a necessary condition of money is that it must function as a medium of exchange, so I don't think a freshly minted bitcoin is money until it's used to conduct trade. If the miner never spends it, it can't be used in trade; it is as though the miner sent it to a null bitcoin address or lost his private key. Based on this condition, the first bitcoins created did not technically count as money until someone apparently used them to buy a pizza. does that make sense?
edit* This is not to say that unspent gold or bitcoin isn't *valuable* - someone may wish to trade for it at a later date. But until they do it's not functioning as a money.

I disagree in the sense that an economy is made up of individuals, and I *believe* that which benefits the individual has a nice side effect of benefiting the whole. Alternatively, we could say that which aims to benefit the whole could also benefit the individual. This seems to be a pretty controversial topic; arguably the merits of everything from capitalism to communism hinges on the answer. So, as empirical evidence I would point to centrally planned economies that have failed spectacularly.

Yeah, I see what you're saying, but you're using the term "cost" in a weird way, is all. Cost refers to what was required at the time of transaction. Maybe you're thinking of value?

EFF also supports Tor, so that would have been a perfect place to point out that bitcoin users who want to conceal their IP can easily do that.


Didn't read the whole white paper, but it basically describes a system of trust in a group of central authorities. 


It is controversial in the sense that free speech is controversial: you have one group trying to restrict the public's right to speak when/how they choose vs having one group trying to influence when/how they spend. Clearly, EFF believes the former is evil. I don't think they've figured out that the latter is just as (if not more) evil.

They both suffer to some extent. Rich people are forced into playing the stock market which exposes them to risk, while poor people are forced to spend every cent they make. The people who benefit are those whose business depends on debt, such as banks and governments.

The top graph shows the bitcoin price as a function of time, where "price" refers to the trade that occurred when the lowest seller sold to the highest buyer. When you mouse over the top graph, the bottom graph shows the "market depth": to the left you have the number of bitcoins people were trying to buy at a given price, and to the right you have the number of bitcoins people were trying to sell at a given price.
I think the reason this is interesting is that if you go to other websites they usually show the *current* market depth, which changes whether or not a trade actually occurs - some orders could be there just to game other people's expectations. This historical view removes all the spammy orders and just shows a snapshop of the order book at the time of the trade, so it more accurately reflects what the market is doing. I'm no day trader, so please correct me if I'm wrong.

What you're asking makes perfect sense from a socialist (lawful-good) perspective: "May I have permission to participate in your voluntary society?" since to a socialist it is the state that *permits* freedom. 
On the other hand, the question makes zero sense from a libertarian (chaotic good), anarcho-capitlist (chaotic neutral), or bitcoin-protocol (true neutral) perspective - it doesn't matter whether the existing user base likes you or not, because the first rule of voluntarism is *you do not ask for permission*. it would be like asking whether or not you have the right to breathe.

Bob's overall goal isn't necessarily to maximize his chances of solving a block, but to maximize his *profits* should he solve the block. The longer he waits to start mining, the more high value tx fees he can collect (tx's that show up after t=0). At some point he can't wait any longer because the payoff will be less than if he hadn't waited in the first place. Therefore what's his optimal wait time? Or, can you prove that his optimal wait time is always zero?
@_date: 2013-03-01 18:55:22


Not exactly - miners will still be competing with each other, so any miner that sets an arbitrary limit on their transaction fee will lose revenue to other miners who don't. It behooves every miner to fill the block with as many fees as possible, sorted from highest to lowest. 
The problem is that if the blocksize is unlimited, memory becomes the limiting factor for revenue, rather than just processor speed. The tie between the Joule and the bitcoin would go away. As a physicist that just seems wrong to me.

(3) Seller tries to eat a 50% loss in the *hopes* of receiving the remaining 50%, so he sends a payment to the buyer. Now the buyer is back to step 1: he demands another ransom in exchange for another promise.
(4) Let's say the seller knows step 3 will follow from paying the ransom. What incentive does he have to throw more money at the buyer in the first place? He already knows the buyer has a proven track record of dishonesty (else, he would have sent him the money in exchange for the product in the first place).
(5) Buyer knows he can't get a ransom because he has no leverage. He is back to step 1: no incentive to keep the private key save for pure malice.

No worries, mate. I agree, though I also find that people tend to accept each other once they understand one another's mindset. This is helpful since no one will remember that you asked nicely :) 
For example, in the bitcoin community, a common theme you'll see is "given problem X, what is the voluntary/free market solution Y, such that all interested parties are served?" So you'll see stories/comments upvoted when they fit this narrative. So if you say something like, "we can solve X by passing a law/taxing/coercing certain parties by changing the protocol" then you'll most certainly get downvoted into oblivion.

"carry the transaction history" means the coin represents the integral of all trades that have occurred between the person who mined the coin and the current owner; by verifying that the coin has the right atomic number, the holder infers that a chain of transactions exists between the miner and the current holder. bitcoin takes it a step further in that it proves not only that a chain of transactions exists, but you can also show all the transactions leading up to the current owner.

It sounds like we're just going to have two bitcoins - one with the old limit and one with some other/floating limit (aka an altcoin). Bitcoin is all about voluntary exchange, so there's nothing stopping those of us who want to keep the limit as is from agreeing to pay higher fees, thus providing incentive for some miners to process them. The rest can change the blocksize or whatever - only time will tell if the market price of your new altcoin can compete with the original.

I'm not sure it's impossible for Bob to come up with a winning strategy that works on-the-fly.

Your initial statement: "If Bitcoins take over as a currency, how the hell would anyone buy a car or a house?" I am simply stating that one does not necessarily need a loan to buy a house or a car if they can accumulate enough saving to do so. In a debt-based economy it makes more sense to take out a loan than to save simply because of inflation destroying your savings over time. With bitcoin it is much easier to save because it can be used as a store of value in addition to being a medium of exchange. So yes, whether you're getting a loan or saving up to buy something has everything to do with the currency you use.

He should have gone into more detail here, but here's a link to episode [68]( of Let's Talk Bitcoin, which this post summarizes. At 28:30 they interview the founder of ZipZap, who are setting up remittance networks with bitcoin as the backend. Their goal is "cash in, cash out" meaning neither the sender or receiver need to own bitcoin. Remittances are a huge portion of the GDP for developing countries and bring in more than foreign aid, the difference being that it goes directly to the families of those working overseas rather than trickle down from the government.

One thing I haven't heard is that if the block size needs to be increased once, it will need to be increased again and again, each time requiring a hard fork. This is because there's a feedback between efficiency and consumption. Anyway, the limit might as well be non-existent, kindof like the debt ceiling. An unlimited block size leads to centralized mining, and centralized mining makes bitcoin vulnerable to violence by the state.
Besides, there is also a consensus among economists that bitcoin is a joke. I'd rather this not be left up to a vote, but through reasoned argument.

A licensed doctor can give bad advice too. This is a reputation problem and it isn't unique to a knowledge marketplace. For example, how do you know the bread you're buying is really bread and not sawdust? Some say that it's the USDA's label that validates the consumer's confidence. On the other hand, the bread maker has a reputation to maintain and he'll lose business to a competitor who doesn't cut corners, so this produces a self-regulating effect as well. eBay, bitcoin-otc, and Silk Road are good examples of reputation tracking, so perhaps it could work here.

I think what I'm saying is that if a miner is trying to optimize his profits, he has to take into account both the block reward and the tx fees, which means monitoring the network and finding a balance between maximum payout and likelihood of success. The more miners start doing this, the more directly tx fees will correlate with confirmation times, which will be crucial for bitcoin going forward.

Indeed. I've heard that miner revenue is a better measure for growth. This [graph]( shows that transaction fees (in BTC) per day has been rising steadily since December, almost by a factor of 2. Given that the price has doubled over the same period, I think we're seeing real growth in the economy and not just speculation.

I just mean that we know what houses are, but it's unclear what makes a house become one person's property and not another's. Just as with money, there seems to be a lot of debate on what property *is* in general, and all the rights pertaining to property depend on an agreed upon definition. Just as with money, most of the time we don't need to think about such things - I own property because this piece of paper says I do - until things change and suddenly ideas are property too, and it's your army of lawyers vs my army and who wins determines what ideas belong to me and shall not be infringed upon. Anyway, the whole idea of property is due for a rude awakening. \rant

for me, a lot of my interest in libertarianism was *because of* bitcoin. From a liberal economics perspective, an economy cannot succeed without a benevolent government steering it toward prosperity. And yet, bitcoin is succeeding in spite of no central authority backing it. That success makes one question the extent to which the state is necessary, which was enough for me to find the libertarian arguments appealing.

You can do whatever you want with the bitcoin source code to make it fit your ideal of what is fair. Release your morally superior version and see whether the market adopts it. I think you'll find that no matter what you do, your monetary policy will have to favor some minorities over others. Even *knowledge* of your new monetary system will put those who don't know at a disadvantage. If the goal is simply to eliminate rich people from society then I'm afraid you'll have to either murder them or make everyone poor, which has also been tried....

It looks like they're trying to build a knowledge marketplace. Sellers are people with expert knowledge in a field who compete with each other for quality. Buyers are people who want knowledge and have to compete with each other for price. Competition minimizes price while maximizing quality. Saying that all knowledge must be regulated is akin to saying that all labor must be regulated, and it produces the same effect: prices will go up, pushing out those who can't afford it. So, a regulatory environment is great *for the people who can afford it*, just like doubling the minimum wage is great for those who get to keep their jobs.

I think Austrian economists would say that most of the bubbles over the last few decades were induced by the state, such as the housing boom and the resulting crash. They would also say that an economy free from central control would be more stable in the long term and everyone would be more prosperous as a result. I would check out the austrian_economics subreddit for more details on this view. This goes against the mainstream view, which is that an economy managed by a benevolent central authority is more favorable to the collective whims of mere mortals. If your base currency is the dollar, it's easy to argue for either view. If you live in Argentina, not so much.

Not sure I understand what you're saying. If he waits the payout will be higher than if he doesn't wait. His probability of finding the block will just be lower because he spends less time mining (and less electricity). I am just arguing that there must be a trade-off between the two.

I see what you're saying. I understand the demand is uncertain, but I'd like to anecdotally offer my pain point as a physicist: I've spent days hacking away at stuff that I'm sure a more capable person could have seen quicker ways through, with better math or methodologies. That kind of advice only exists on forums, where the merits of the question are determined by the crowd and the charity of the person answering. The alternative is to figure-it-out-for-yourself, and people are *shocked* that it took you 7 years to get your PhD. Sure some people make it through and you get the occasional breakthrough, but I've seen so many people get burned out and depressed by that grind, going down rabbit holes that don't need to be explored, in the name of science that someone already did 50 years ago. Today it feels like academia is where science goes to die. It's sad and wasteful, but it's also an opportunity to build something better. I hope someone finds the way to capitalize on it, even if it's not you taking the risk.

This is awesome for another reason: it should increase price stability. Here's why:
Let's say for every purchase made with bitcoin, a merchant converts the received btc to fiat, while the bitcoin customer converts the same amount of fiat to bitcoin. Lets say both orders show up on an exchange at the same time - one buy matching the lowest seller, and one sell matching the highest bidder. This increases the spread slightly; however, market participants will respond by bringing the bid-ask spread closer together. A reduced spread should result in increased liquidity, and thus price stability. 
Of course, I've left out a lot details - there a multiple exchanges, there are exchange fees, and there are middle-men like bitpay. Regardless, there should still be some price-stabilizing affect coming out of this.

You seem to be saying that a sufficient condition for money is that it is the most liquid asset. I am not disputing that. I'm saying that another sufficient condition may be that it somehow embodies an economy's trade history.


I see your point, but I don't think you would accept my coffee cup as money *especially* if no one else has. Continuing your analogy, the problem is that we're used to seeing and driving around in cars, so nobody will dispute that something that looks like a car is a car. However, if I told you some guy named satoshi invented a machine that looks nothing like a car but will forever change human transportation, then yeah we would have to look at what it really means for something to be a car.

I agree to some extent - that's why I say "effectively". here in the US taxes are usually taken out of your pay before it hits your bank account, so no tax dodging there. but there are a ton of people working under the table already, and bitcoin just compounds the issue. if the shadow economy offers more economic opportunity than the above-board one, then tax revenue would take a huge hit. Also, it makes fractional reserve banking useless, so that's two knobs.

You can prove that such a trade history *exists* by checking the authenticity of the coin, even though you don't know what the trade history was. Bitcoin works the same way - you know these transactions occurred, but you don't know their content (the parties involved, what goods were exchanged etc).
edit: another way to look at it is that gold stores the integral of all transactions leading from the miner to the current holder, while bitcoin breaks up the integral into segments connecting bitcoin wallets.
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:34:23
I see what you mean. I was thinking in terms of the nodes discriminating between bits that have a fee attached vs ones that don't and that this would be seen as discriminating between the "haves" and "have-nots". In any case, I think it's going to be controversial.

Silk road the site was shut down, not the vendors themselves. I agree, eBay's payment method reduces risk, but that doesn't make their reputation useless either. bitcoin-otc has scams yes, but not for the highest rated users. You can read the reviews and judge for yourself.
For an individual knowledge seller to build a reputation, they would have to start small: they would have to offer a lower price if their rep is low relative to an expert with a proven record and higher rep. The buyer can then choose to get cheap advice from a less reputable source or pay more for someone with a proven history.

The bitcoin customer can also buy them up again 10 seconds after purchase, basically negating any negative effects the merchant has on the market. The pairing of equal buy and sell orders should lead to a more stable price overall.

This is why I think it's actually a cool escrow method. Google defines scam/fraud as 


In this case, the buyer doesn't gain anything by not fulfilling his part of the bargain, so greed has nothing to do with it. It would take a special kind of asshole to not send the private key (or the buyer could have gone into a coma or something..). The important thing for the seller is that it reduces their risk to the set of clients who are just pure evil, while excluding those who are doing it for financial gain.

On the other hand, it's always daytime somewhere and bitcoin knows no borders. I think there will still be a processing time, but only if the blocksize is reached:
Say a miner sorts tx fees from highest to lowest and begins hashing. Every time a tx with a fee higher than yours shows up, your tx moves further down in his ranking. If your fee was low enough, it will eventually get kicked out of the miner's current working set (due to the limit on blocksize), so if that miner happens to be the one who solves the next block your transaction will not be in it. However, the probability that the miner finds the correct hash before kicking your tx out is non-zero. So, you have a reduced chance of being in the next block because you paid a lower fee, but that chance will be the same for each consecutive block (assuming the distribution function of fees doesn't change too fast). 
Say the probability of *not* being in the next block was P. For N consecutive blocks, the probability of not being confirmed is P^N which tends to zero. This means that if you can measure the distribution function of tx fees, you should be able to estimate the time it will take to get your tx confirmed if you pay the corresponding fee, which would be a boon to the bitcoin economy IMO.
tl;dr. Yes, the confirmation time should eventually be correlated with tx fee, but not because of the time of day.

To clarify: does this mean that when the block limit is reached, those paying a lower fee will still get included in the block chain, just at a later time? This fits well with the notion of [Time Preferences]( but for transactions.
