took about 3/4 year, but had to hone the settings to get it running well. in the first few months it crashed often. see top post. thx for the tip, but not looking for options. i am trying to run it on my smallest hardware (except tplinks with openwrt, that would be fun, fullblock spv or something hehe, maybe create a challenge for full/pruned/spv bitcoin nodes on smallest hardware possible)

just to clarify WHAT I'm running: it runs on RPI1 because i have adjusted some cli options. "checkblocks=50" for faster startup, "checklevel=1" for less verfication but i use another server i run to sync only from that one ip. "maxmempool=5" limits mempool to 5mb, i could set this lower. "maxorphantx=1" could set this to zero. "disablewallet". "prune=550" prune to 550megs. "dbcache=20" database cache to 20megs. "connect=IP" and "maxconnections=1" to only connect to this IP. "minrelaytxfee=0.0001" could increase that to 0.001 imho. "limitfreerelay=5" sh/could set that to 0. AND i use a mini-usb-harddisk to store the bitcoin directory. it works really well and because its a HDD it doesn't wear out, it just fails haha. AND i have a 2GB swapfile on the sdcard seperate from the bitcoin-dir. AND i don't run as root and doesn't run as highest priority so no problems with ssh. linux is like a baby, feed it the right food and it'll keep on living. Blockchain took about 3/4 of a year to sync. But now i just copy it over from my normal node when i need to kickstart a RPI. Also the settings were not perfect from day one. (Problem with reddit, people like me are scared of the politicising masses that have no idea of running anything, maybe one should create a reddit where one has to solve a riddle with a random programming language, PoWpow *politicsoff*, to the mods: thx for still allowing throwaway accounts and also great job done here making the sub readable)
