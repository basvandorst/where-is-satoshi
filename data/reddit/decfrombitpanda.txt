What would you like to know exactly?
Founded in 2014 by early Bitcoin enthusiasts. 
Wanted to make it easy to get Bitcoin in Europe at a time that it was difficult and shady. 
Six years later and we're about to launch our exchange, we have a payments license, 30 digital assets including precious metals and a bunch of awesome features like Bitpanda Swap and Bitpanda Savings :D

What symbol? 
@_date: 2019-03-19 11:22:52
Hey there We launched with credit cards as they are the easiest to implement but rest assured that we are working on other payment methods. Unfortunately, it's not as easy as just clicking a button, like some people think.
Hope that answered your question! Keep your eyes on [our Twitter]( as we announce everything there first.

I would say it's more reasonable to add the context of the last year of relative stability
@_date: 2019-03-19 09:22:05
Very nice to hear it. We just try to make it easy for people to get their hands on BTC! If you need any help, just let me know :)
@_date: 2019-03-29 15:22:49
**But**... as there are no 'set dates' where the price is low and high, then one can't plan. Plus, the price is still currently volatile. Maybe cost averaging is the best way to negate the negative effects of that volatility?
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:48:15
No. But that would be pretty convenient. 
@_date: 2019-03-28 11:19:29
He gave us ([Bitpanda]( a shout out and we we were pretty pleased!  
@_date: 2019-03-18 18:48:42
We do make it pretty easy anyway though! 
@_date: 2019-08-10 10:46:40
We have said for months that we expect iOS app to come out before the end of the year.

Have you tried [Bitpanda Global Exchange](   
(We offer maker and taker fees as low as 0.05% plus 25% off starting this month if you hold our own token BEST.)   
Might help you bring your trading costs down :)  
Also, if you're regular user then join [our sub](

Wow. This is the first time I have seen a reddit user posting about our ads. Thank you, If you live in Vienna and want to check out out other ads, head to the underground stations Praterstern and Schottentor where we have more variations from our new ad campaign!
Cheers, guys :)  
Edit: We are certainly different to Coinbase!
@_date: 2019-06-05 12:20:55
And if anyone has any questions, just let me know right here!
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:57:36
Subway is never a bad idea, I was a sandwich artist once but my sandwiches always looked like abstract Salvador Dali pieces so no one wanted to buy them :(

Hi Are you using iOS or Android? Currently we only offer an app for Android but iOS is in development as we speak. 
Here's the link to the Play Store: 
Lemme know if that helps,
@_date: 2019-06-05 14:46:23
Thanks for the kind words, we really just want to make getting Bitcoin as easy as ordering a pizza or going on Netflix.  
As a Bitpanda user, you should also look into [our IEO]( which will launch before the exchange next month.   
The new Bitpanda coin will be called BEST and investors will enjoy up to 25% fee reduction on trading fees.   
Any questions about $BEST - lemme know here or just look at the landing page above.
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:31:59
Me, but I work there so that makes sense.   
If you need anything then let me know :)
@_date: 2019-06-05 12:48:02
Hey Thanks for sharing our video. Of course, we honour Bitcoin! There would be none of this without Bitcoin.  
If anyone here has any questions re. Bitpanda the platform or our upcoming exchange - please let me know and I'll do my best to answer.  
@_date: 2019-06-26 12:40:45
We're not an exchange, we're a broker.   
However, we did recently announced that Bitpanda Global Exchange will go live in August for global trading :)
@_date: 2019-02-26 14:52:06
Unfortunately not yet, but we are very aware that many of our users use an iPhone and we're making moves to get the app out, it's important for us to release a working product and not rush anything. Hope you understand :)
@_date: 2019-04-02 17:56:24
My favourite so far
@_date: 2019-04-02 12:07:41
Hey, This is part of a set of three and this is the most recent one :)
@_date: 2019-04-04 10:17:21
What does this mean for us and the industry? Well, we are one of the few European cryptocurrency fintechs to receive such a license and it allows us to offer even more innovative products and services - we can begin to connect the world of cryptocurrency and payments.
@_date: 2019-04-05 08:41:36
I believe we were the quickest o get it but don't quote me. I will check back and respond with a more solid answer today, @_date: 2019-04-02 12:48:38
I'm really happy you saw it there  :)   
It could be the case that they were rolled out by the partner at different times at different places.
@_date: 2019-04-04 12:34:01
Thanks for the congratulatios I can't say too much right now but I would have a look at what Lukas Enzersdorfer said in the article about halfway down...
  
edit: ...and make of that what you will.
@_date: 2019-04-29 12:34:42
Hey !  
I remember your post in our subreddit! What exactly do you think you can't do with Bitpanda? I'm sure I can help you but I remember your post didn't quite make sense.  
All the best,   
Dec (from Bitpanda)
@_date: 2019-04-03 05:26:44
Thank you, oh oinky one. 
@_date: 2019-04-02 15:19:17
Badam tss. 
@_date: 2019-04-05 08:39:22
Thanks, and nice name haha.  
Follow our [subreddit]( to see the exciting things that will happen this year, maybe you will use Bitpanda again in another way :)
@_date: 2019-04-04 17:47:50
We now have a payments license which opens then doors for what users will be able to do with Bitpanda. We are basically allowed to handle payments.
@_date: 2019-04-29 12:43:15
From what I understood, you wanted to search for your transaction on the blockchain. This is perfectly possible, you just need to visit a block explorer and make sure you're using the 'deposit address' from your Bitpanda account.  
The important part that you use the deposit address and not any other number such as the transaction number.   
Let me know if that helps :)
@_date: 2019-05-29 05:58:13
What was the problem? We rarely have complaints but are always open to feedback.
@_date: 2019-05-28 17:22:22
You noticed our ad! Very cool.
See if you can find them all like Pokemon and keep your eyes on our social media the next few weeks as we have some pretty exciting things in the pipeline.

Hey /u/ AtTheEndOfCopes  
 
No paper gold here. Just real, physically-backed gold. We're announcing details about delivery in the coming days but you're more than welcome to have a read through our [landing page]( :)   
All the best and if I can help anymore, just let me know.

It's in development as we speak.
