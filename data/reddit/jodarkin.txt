Nixon took the Dollar of the Gold Standard in 1971. But don´t feel stupid, you are not alone, many high level business people and CEOs still don´t know that also. The same with fractional reserve, it doesn´t exist today anymore with 0% required reserves. The term Dollar actually was a measure for the weight of a certain amount of silver. So 2 Dollar meant twice that amount. The paper version just represented having Silver in a Bank Vault. Like the british Pound. Meaning sterling silver= a pound of silver in .925 purity. All western nations had that. But when people got used to trade paper for goods, the new generations thought of money being identical to paper. And then the printing presses started to print more than silver was in the vaults.

And indeed it does exaclty that. Everytime some miner announces a new block and the nodes relay it thru the network all other miners stop their work and start a new block, collecting unconfirmed transactions and include the last blocks hash (hash=the fingerprint of the entire new transactions the miner included in the new block, plus all the other blocks). That is how all blocks are chained to gether. Hence the term block chain or in newspeak blockckain. It is costly to run miners and not finding a block has to be compensated by the times your miner finds one. So all the money that flowed into mining operations created processing power bigger as 50.000 times more powerfull than the 500 best supercomputers (the numbers are even old ones and it is even bigger now). That ensures that no single entity can just simply start mining, create all the blocks by itself and basically controle what gets written and what not. Mining uses hundreds of MW electrical power and even all google servers world wide would not even amount to 1% of that.

But deflation has another more valuable reason that always gets ignored. Since people want other peoples money and they see more value in waiting, but still have needs, the people that want money are asked to offer better solutions to the people with money.
It is actually awesome. It means our economy will become driven by real solutions and not just some schemes to get other people money.

What miners do is try to find "a specific thing" called a hash. That hash can only be created in combination with the previous blocks hash and the transactions they put into it. In ELI5 its like there are individuals having for example 5 dice and the want to have 2 sixes in one throw. that does not happen maybe on the first try. So they try again. Now the protocol aims for 10 min for a block to be found. That means the more computer power there is, because more people add computer power to also get btc to later sell them, in ELI5 it would be like more people trowing dice. Surely one will have at least two sixes in one throw, so the protocoll recalculates after roughly two weeks and say that now there have to be 3 sixes in in one throw. Makes sense?

That is the route the bitcoin core developer aim for. Segwit is a step that enables things like lightning network. A way where people commit some btc into a payment channel and are able to send these back and forth as often they want. When they close the channel the end balance just needs one transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain instead of all the transaction between those parties. Basically having unlimited transactions within the blocksize as of today. This reduces a lot of data, making it possible for everybody to run a node to verify everything on the blockchain yourself. Otherwise with   bigger blocks some people will not be able to to that and will rely on companies that are well financed and have good network connections/live in the better part of the world. Wanting to do bigger blocks will always require needing even more bigger block as the world connects to the Bitcoin blockchain for every thing. Think of IoT (Internet of Things).

A miner has to include the hash value from the previous block. A newly found block by some other miner would mean your block with the small PC would not be accepted because the network already added new blocks to the chain. So you would have to start again, but this time with the newly found last blocks hash value.
