Bitcoin doesn't need sensationalist titles linking to manipulated charts. Raw data, or at least accurate presentation is a much better option. We should all be taking the high road here. Any professional see's through this kind of thing instantly and it takes away credibility from all who promote it. Sorry if that is harsh, but it is true.
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:07:24
You don't need to disclose exact numbers if you don't want to. You do need to put in zeros on the days with no BTC sales. The chart will look very different. Displaying the days with no BTC sales as having a volume cause by a different days BTC sales means the chart is useless for showing anything of value.
@_date: 2014-01-17 07:10:46
This should be a bar graph, or have 0 entered for days with no sales. Kind of useless as it stands.

The money is not created with a ledger entry. I can write a ledger entry creating a billion USD in my account but it is worthless. The money is created because the depositor still THINKS they have money, while in fact the borrower actually has it.  
  
The borrower spends the actually money which they borrowed as normal. At the same time, the depositor spends their OTHER money which is not in the bank is if the total amount of money they had INCLUDED the money in the bank, while in fact it is not there.  
  
They spend more of their money not in the bank then they would if it was ALL of their money, because in their head they have more money then they do physically on their person.

I would suggest you read the link I posted in my edit of the top comment of this page to the wikipedia article for Money Supply before proceeding.  
  
Also understand that basically all the arguments on this page are in response to this statement:  
  
"Fractional reserve banking entails the creation of new money that is fungible with already preexisting money, i.e. it can be used interchangeably within the currency’s payment systems. This is impossible with Bitcoin."  
  
Economics can be complex, trying to address the central idea of statements like the one quoted is more important than correcting the semantics. The original authors use of FRB banking is irrelevant. It was not in scope to correct his semantics, how he should have worded that sentence more correctly, so it could be incorrect more clearly. Instead it is more important to address the idea expressed.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:05:37
Money market funds hold securities (notes/bonds). I am not sure what your point is.
First line of Wikipedia on FRB:
"Fractional-reserve banking is the practice whereby a bank retains only a portion of its customers' deposits as readily available reserves from which to satisfy demands for withdrawals."
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:05:17
Thank you, that is exactly my point. The argument going on here is that some people think bitcoins created in the same manner are not "real" bitcoins, while USD created this way are. The market affects are real, so it is real money even if it is not "real" bitcoins or USD.
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:42:38
If that constitutes a bitcoin substitute, then every dollar you have in the bank is NOT a dollar, only a dollar substitute. All your dollars at Chase are in fact only "Chase Dollars", not REAL dollars. Do you act like they are not real dollars? No, of course not, you act like they are. You can go get them whenever you want. That is why having them there increases the money supply.
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:00:21
Yeah I got a notification that it will take 48 hour to clear as it is my first transaction. Seems fair. Site has been operational for a while I am not worried.
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:41:31
Just so you know, I graduated with a near perfect A average BA in Economics. I started a dissertation about bank manipulation of the business cycle through controlling the money supply by fractional reserve lending. When people say banks create new money, it is in the MIND of the person who thinks their deposit is in the bank, while in fact only 10% of it is there. Every time it is lent up to 90% of the original deposit is "created". 
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:08:08
I love how you change the subject after every singe rebuttal. This is once again totally off topic and completely irrelevant.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:25:10
M1 would include checking account funds. You would need to look at M2 for savings accounts or money market funds. M3 includes CD accounts. M4 includes bonds/commercial paper.
These are all examples of how the more you lend money, the more the supply of money increases.
Did you write the original article? If so I would suggest you correct it before writing another.
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:14:49
The M0 of USD is not fuzzy, it is the physical currency in circulation today. It is exactly interchangeable to bitcoins created through block solving in every respect. While the final amount of bitcoin's M0 is set in stone, it really has no bearing on this argument. We are talking about effects that happen whether or not M0 is increasing or static.
Inflation does occur through increasing of M0, but there are far bigger effects when monetary policy of the higher M's are changed. It is why everyone follows the Federal Fund Rate so closely. Tight money and loose money are the common terms for when then FED increases or decreases interest rates to money lent to institutions (banks). A small change to the cost of borrowing money can lead to gigantically larger inflation or deflation then actually changing M0. If banks can borrow money for basically free as they can now from policy trying to stop the depression they borrow more, lend more, and increase M1, M2, M3, M4 in the process. The lower the interest rates set in the Fed Fund Rate, the "cheaper" it is to borrow money. 
Here is some hard data to back that up:
Current M0 is 1.1 trillion.
M1 is 2.6 trillion.
M2 is 10.9 trillion. 
That means basically checking and savings accounts have 13.7 trillion vs 1.1 trillion that actually exists as cash.
That is over 10 times the amount of money created from lending, as created from printing. It follows that policies related to printed, will have less effect than policies related to lending of the money.
A BTC FRB bank doesn't need to gamble that they will mine money, they gamble that they get new deposits, or repayments of loans, before people come to withdraw.
BTC has huge advantages over USD in terms of being regulated by processing power rather than edict. The US can make laws about its use in the US, but they can not void transactions unless they have 51% of the network, which is fairly unfeasible if it is adapted globally, and would likely cost more that the entire marketcap of BTC.
BTC would expand and contract through FRB just like any other currency, but it would be based on global economic markets. A country could make a big play for BTC, and buy a large percentage of it if they choose. In that case they could control much of the market by regulating how they lend the BTC they bought. But this would still be a true market force, rather then one by edict, as they WOULD have to buy it at market prices.

It is only defalcation if the site you deposit on specifically says "we will hold your original bitcoin in your own personal wallet and never have access to it" and then lends it. If they make no guarantee, or better yet specifically say they WILL lend it, and pay you interest, then it is FRB. There is no way the BTC protocol can stop a company from becoming a BTC bank that lends out deposits if it chooses to. Lending of deposits is FRB.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:27:14
Yes, they ledger entry is important to the system so that when the depositor goes to get their money back, the bank knows how much to give.
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:15:27
Creating new USD if the mints shut down is impossible as well. It has no bearing at all on FRB banking systems. They can still exist.
Issuing a mortgage, and issuing a mortgage backed security are 2 very different things.  
  
If I deposit my money in a bank account, I am lending it to the bank.
@_date: 2013-12-15 22:39:56
This is why we have M0, M1, M2, M3, M4 etc. They are different ways of accounting the supply of money. The Federal Government and really anyone involved in any market all agree that bonds and commercial paper are an important part of the money supply, and track them in M4.  
Pure BTC would be M0.
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:23:00
Fractional reserve banking can not exist in USD either if people have to **hold** all their money as cash. However they do not have to hold all their money, they can lend it to a bank. It is at that stage where FRB because a reality. It has absolutely nothing to do with the medium at all. It as a byproduct of lending. Bitcoin is not immune in any way shape or form, people do not have to hold all of their bitcoin. If they for example keep bitcoin in a coinbase account, they are no longer holding it.
Would you argue that "fractional reserve banking cannot develop within the USD system of transfers"? Because USD are hard physical cash? Is it not a valid point.
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:52:57
I agree with you, however I feel this comment should be addressing Throwahoymatie one level higher instead of me.
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:07:09
I ask you, what is this "actual" expanding of the money supply that you think happens with FRB USD lender and not with a bitcoin lender? I advise you to read up on what the money supply is and the different methods of accounting it:
  
  
If you are talking about M0, then for bitcoin that would be the coins created through mining, in USD that would be what is printed at the Mints. FRB does NOT increase M0, to increase M0 you have to print more money. FRB DOES increase M1 and M2, as they would increase the M1 and M2 of bitcoin as well.  
  
I think what you and others may be confused about, is that M0 is not the only, or the most important, measure of the supply of money.

My Magna cum Laude Economics degree says otherwise. What are your credentials?
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:23:31
That is what fractional reserve banking is. Banks holding USD can lend 90% of deposits and must hold on to the remaining fraction (1/10) in cash. There is no "Bitcoin Central Bank" to enforce 100% reserves as the article states.  With bitcoin there is NO reserve requirement at all. The article is factually incorrect on many counts.
@_date: 2013-12-16 06:39:41
This comment is totally off topic on what I wrote here. Are you calling M4 a 4th derivative? If I go and buy a treasury bill, the value of that bill goes into the accounting of M4. That is not a derivative product, it is a security. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:24:00
You are once again changing the topic. What bearing does a government printing money in the case of a bank run, have on "actually" creating money at the time of lending? They are two completely separate events.
I will not even try to address the topic of printing money to stop a bank run as I know you will change that topic when I reply as well. Please stay on topic or this discussion can go nowhere.
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:26:21
Well said!
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:30:16
I have no idea if coinbase or any other sites does this, it was just an example as to why the article is incorrect. If coinbase does choose to account in this manner there is nothing to stop them. If users are OK with the policy and still held BTC at coinbase then fractional reserve will develop. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:45:36
Don't forget all the transaction fees if I was to sell for USD! Probably more like $135.
I view the expenditure as motivation to learn more about Bitcoin and stay on top of the news. However if I have the chance to buy beer with it I will empty the account!

Note that it is the withdrawl that will take time to clear. The Bitcoins are already cleared from the purchase in Linden Dollars and now they are being transferred from an internal wallet to my personal wallet.

This so far has been the only way I even found it possible to get USD into Bitcoin. What is a better alternative? I wasted tons of time setting up accounts at places like Dwolla only to have them shut down after giving them all my personal information and spending weeks verifying transactions and transfers. I had numerous people go silent during one to one transactions on sites like Ebay, after taking my money. Then go through dispute processes. I was sick of wasting so much time on frustrating processes, that I gave up.
At least now I finally have SOMETHING to show for all the time I have spent researching, following and attempting to buy Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:48:27
Yeah it is. It just feels wrong. However I spent MANY wasted hours in the past trying to get Bitcoin, so taking into play a $/hour cost of my time this was much cheaper, although I never actually even got any until now despite my efforts in the past.  
@_date: 2013-12-15 21:33:11
It is not double spending, read my original post. If coinbase gives my coin to another user who transfers a coin out, and does not replace it until I request it, then I still think I have a coin while it has actually already been transfered.

The farmer buys the tractor for 1 real BTC at time 0.25. He uses the tractor to harvest his crops which he sells for 1.1 real BTC at time 0.75. He then pays back the real 1.1 BTC at time 1.  
  
The tractor was sold for a real BTC.

Like sprinkler said. This is not only possible, but happens quite often. It is called a bank run, and is why the FDIC exists for USD deposits.

This article is incorrect in its statement that bitcoin cannot have fractional reserve banking. It is just as easy, in fact far easier, to have fractional reserve banking with bitcoin then USD.  
  
If you "have" bitcoins in your coinbase account. There is nothing stopping coinbase from giving those bitcoins to someone else. If they just keep a marker as to how many bitcoin you are supposed to have, and replace them when you want them, you are none the wiser. When they do that, the other party is getting bitcoins while you still THINK you have bitcoins even though you do not. That increases the supply of bitcoins artificially, which is what they state cannot happen.
  
Regulated banks are required to keep a fraction of the total amount in cash as a reserve, fractional reserve. Bitcoin has no regulations, and as such is even more of a target for manipulation through this type of accounting than USD. Sure if everyone held their bitcoins in their own personal wallets this would not be a problem, but it would not be a problem with USD either if everyone held cash.
I think it is important that people realize, that the money supply in both USD and Bitcoin, is not mearly the amount of physical dollars, or bitcoins, minted. That is only one part of the money supply, **M0** to be precise. Another method of accounting the money supply is **M1**, which includes checking accounts. Coinbase would fall into M1. M2, M3, M4 and other accounts of the money supply exist as well and are all vitally important for many calculations in banking, and general economics. You can read some more about it here:

Are you convinced 1 is incorrect at this point?  
  
The thing about FRB, is that it IS optimal in many respects. Where do you think your car loan and mortgage come from? What about all the small business loans? They are important parts of society.  
  
Also say I have BTC that I don't need to spend this instant, and do not want to lock in to a long term investment. If my choices to deposit them in a BTC bank for a small interest rate or leave them in a wallet and get nothing, the small return is optimal.
