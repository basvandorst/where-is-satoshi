I would pay 10x what they charge. You can always use other software.
@_date: 2015-06-10 06:43:16
It's not a feature for people not to want - it's a fee to use the software. It's its a problem fork it or don't use it.
@_date: 2015-06-18 16:12:36
great hardware actually - but ruined by robocoins software. The  conversion works great
@_date: 2014-01-22 15:48:52
I'm going to hazard a guess here - snapCard probably accept your bitcoins, convert them to dollars and pay your taxes for you in $.

If the hacker sent straight to an exchange - that exchange should have the hacker's KYC docs and potentially bank details. If they do we get the cops involved.

The test was for the UK site. Making it global is very little work so I expect a short test period then a roll out.

In terms of completeness I think we have made a system for a small niche. BitID and bitauth have a wider range of applications.
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:33:31
I think this may be an option. Again a long shot, but I'll skype you and we can put together a short email to a bunch of exchanges.

I have helped a couple of people set up payments like this. The first question I have is what country are the partners based in? In some places it's easy to cash out of bitcoin, but other lack infrastructure still. Depending on your answer it may not be too hard, or you may have to only pay a portion of them in btc to start with.
Email me @ hugh if you want to discuss things further.

It's with bitpay, but they are tempted to just hold the coins.
The bitpay integration is done already (and was done in  days with 2 devs). The rest is plugging in their standard workflow. They said if they did it it would be max 2 weeks work but should be less.
@_date: 2014-07-21 23:58:51
Thank you for helping out.

I wouldn't worry - bitstamp have a track record of slow withdraws during heavy periods. I hope they fix their systems, but so far the withdraws have always turned up eventually (for me).
I'm waiting on a withdraw from last night - 11 hours ago. It's annoying because the coins aren't for me - I have a customer waiting for his coins. If I could cancel I could send from another wallet but alas it's in limbo so I can only wait.

Most alt-coins deliver a make money fast to the moon campaign. Look at the ethereum code - they are adding computation to the blockchain. This will be the world's first distributed singleton - 1 computer whose state everybody can agree on. This is huge!

Every one of your problems is solvable and I am working on it with a network of very well placed companies and individuals. I'm hoping we'll pull it off within 6 months.

Hugh here from Quickbitcoin.
I'm not sure that would be an issue. People are paying us fiat and we are sending the bitcoins. If the hot wallet is shared among 2 people then how will the web wallet know whose account to credit? I don't think any could be built like this.
For payments out that would make sense of course. Webwallets often pay out from the same addresses but deposits have to be to unique wallets for every user.
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:27:49
The hops were too quick for that. Possible but very unlikely.

You can use egopay or wire transfer via a third party (mayzus financial services) to deposit on cointrader.net

Do you have any data to back this up? Won't help here, but all the fuss from the regulators about bitcoin being mixable and laundered - it would be nice to show that in fact it's traceable and that the current system is the one that's broken.

BIP38 is an encryption method. Means you need a password.
New ways may appear but you'll always be able to use the old.
unlike VHS you don't still need a working VHS player - just a bit of code ;)

TEACH is a charity in Tanzania who now accept bitcoin donations. I'm glad to see more charities finding bitcoin useful.
From their website:
'TEACH – Time to Empower Africa's Children is a dynamic, frontline charity working to alleviate poverty through the power of education. We provide innovative and holistic educational programmes which place the power to change firmly in young people's hands. Sustainability is at the heart of TEACH's work – which is why we believe a hand up is more effective than a hand out.
TEACH are committed to empowering the next generation of youth leaders in both Africa and the UK. Our field projects in Tanzania and Ghana focus on fuelling internally-driven change through local change-makers. We work with rural youth to equip and empower them with the relevant skills, knowledge and mentorship to identify &amp; tackle the challenges in their immediate surroundings, uplifting themselves and their community.'

I'll pass it on to the charity.

Please can you keep posting updates here as the case progresses. There's a lot of bitcoiners that'll be watching.
@_date: 2014-10-21 14:16:14
Paying out the btc is simple - the issue is how the recipient converts that back to fiat locally.
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:18:22
Its a step towards merchants accepting bitcoin directly. Should help ;)
@_date: 2014-08-08 11:21:51
not quite. So far you go through the order process, you choose your food, pay with bitpay, then - no order is sent to the restaurants and no food is delivered.
They said it would be under 2 weeks work to finish it off and test... The team who built it are very keen and say it could be online within a week. There was another guy who seemed to be in charge of decisions on whether they go ahead or not - he was slightly more nervous - which is why they told me to gage interest by tweeting at them.
The more tweets the faster they'll do it ;)
@_date: 2014-10-08 15:42:29
Do you know what exchange this is?
@_date: 2014-08-11 14:49:29
I invested because I want the network to exist so I can build on top of it. Making me rich from the launch would be nice of course but there's far easier coins to pump&amp;dump and make money out of.
@_date: 2014-05-05 11:56:31
it uses a radio sygnal ;)
@_date: 2014-08-04 14:24:58
haha - I want the legal system to clarify the terms they use to classify bitcoin. In the UK the HMRC (like the IRS) used to say bitcoin was a 'face value single use voucher' which was plain wrong. They have now removed this and learnt about bitcoin and rephrased it properly.
We need a clear legal arena for all this.
@_date: 2014-08-08 15:32:16
Or use cointrader.net - much easier to deal with
@_date: 2014-10-08 15:43:34
I know - but given the mixing wasn't done properly (or at all it seems) then maybe he messed that up too and used a real identity.
@_date: 2014-10-09 22:32:27
This opens a wider question - should we attempt to get exchanges to opt into publishing their hot wallets. Might be a good idea for this and for proof of solvency.
@_date: 2014-07-31 23:49:27
the ether in the ethereum sale isn't all going to the founders. The profit will go to those who create apps on the network from my understanding.

@_date: 2014-11-16 18:42:42
Hugh here from Quickbitcoin.
I have looked (briefly) at both of these in the past. I think our login system is a far simpler but more limited in terms of what applications could use it. We actually don't need to confirm the identity of the user by them logging in. We can confirm the identity from the name on the payment which allows for this simplified method.
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:51:51
Whether it's a good idea technically or whether it will actually work aside - we do need a solution. I had transactions made to me paying 0.0002btc as a fee - double the 'standard fee' - which took several hours to confirm because the blocks were full. This gets in the way of normal business.
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:57:52
If the effect of this is more centralisation and the community care about decentralisation then no one will upgrade.
@_date: 2015-08-17 14:56:12
If this is truly a consensus system miners have the choice to vote. No one is forcing XT onto miners - just like bitcoin core, it is a CHOICE. You are attempting to force people away from doing something - exactly what you are arguing against.
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:17:10
I think the only option to get a technical vote is get a more powerful computer.
The other way of course is to get involved in online discussions about it and persuade more people to join.

Circuits can be printed but they end up quite large. We could probably print a QR code wallet. I might give it a go.

unless the merchant pays for access to the government specified API. This will never work as laws are different in different countries. This is stupid.

They accept UK bank transfers. Average time to receiving your coins is approx 15 minutes.

you can print solder wiring due to it's low melting temp. Basically you print the channels in ABS, then print the solder into it. -

Yes we can, but no we won't. In the UK this is not legal. In the US I understand you can print your own if you have a license?

except the unleashed beast is still young. Regulation is good for bitcoin, coinValidation is terrible as it centralises governance.
