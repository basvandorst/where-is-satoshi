You're right. I got them confused. Pretty cool though!

They've accepted bitcoin for a while now.

Transaction purgatory... this is the best way I've ever heard it described. Gonna steal this for future explanations.

I generally wiggle things to loose them. Sometimes I use a wrench.

I think litecoin would be better as an alternative for noobs to use. It is established, similar to bitcoin, and lacks the divisive politics/FUD/misinformation that can be found in the btc/bch space.

I think the "thus far" implies that, while they have not reached the goal (low fees), they are making progress at a rate which OP is satisfied with.

At what point did he say any of those things? I also hope that we can have a society with roads and hospitals, and I'm not a communist.

Don't worry about questions, we've all been there at one point or another. Bitcoin has an overall upwards trend in value, so holding your bitcoin will most likely result in profits. If you invested at the start of 2017, you could have easily tripled your money. When I was having thoughts similar to yours, bitcoin was worth about 500$. I didnt end up buying until it was in the 3000s. It will never be "too late" to invest. 
Taking in the system as a whole can take a while, so if you feel any doubts, try spending a smaller amount of money as a "test". Buying less than 1 bitcoin is totally cool; there is no penalty or anything like that.
There are some options when purchasing Bitcoin. Most people I know spend there initial few hundred dollars through Coinbase. Coinbase only requires credit card information and pays instantly. However, it has a weekly limit (about 200$ I think). Their fee is 3.9% if I remember correctly. There are other methods, and I recommend you try them out later on, once you get to know the ecosystem better and plan on spending larger amounts.
Make sure to keep your Bitcoin in a secure wallet. Immediately transfer any and all money out of any online wallet if you plan to use cold storage. You can try software wallets, hardware wallets or even paper wallets (I highly recommend looking into all of these). A hardware or paper wallet would be best if you plan on a long term storage. When moving a lot of bitcoin around, I usually send a small amount first, and make sure I have the correct wallet address before sending the full amount.
TL;DR/My suggestion: Start with a smaller amount of Bitcoin and get use to the way things work. Then decide how much you really want to buy and how you want to buy it. Make sure to use a secure wallet, and always be careful and double check things in any situation where errors can be costly.
Hope that helps.

There's a new card coming out called Monaco card. It will have low fees, and it will allow the use of many crypto and fiat vurrencies. It even has cash back! Rollout is expected in Q1 of 2018.
