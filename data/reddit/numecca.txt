I heard from a friend who knows the guy that published the original material on quantum computers popping bitcoin wallets, that it will happen within 5 years. Publicly he says 10, privately he says 5.
What should we do with this information? Also coming from academia, the price will collapse by end of summer.

It’s nearly infinite when we get off this rock. As you know. Which blows a hole in scarcity. Which I guess it appreciates on earth at 1.5%. 
So I also disagree. I think gold is for pirates ;)

Great comment!
Its social acceptance outside the bubble is as follows:
We have a very warped view of what it looks like to the world when we see it on MSMBC, etc. like the average person doesn’t care, and this is the actual brand recall in the wild.

It’s not efficient and it’s old. People who argue for a rock are weird.

I never asked, but maybe not to alarm people? I have no idea, I was just passed this information from a friend in that world.

I have addiction to weed since it is so accessible in CA. Never thought I would smoke weed since I hated it as a kid, but I have found that I prefer being high all day. 
I just bought this pack to endure the sweats  from cutting off weed. Have to stop because the habit is too expensive. I have to smoke half a joint just to get the effect of three puffs when I started. 
Don’t smoke weed kids. It makes your pee pee fall off.

If the marketing stays like your post, good luck. Sorry. This is not going to move what it needs to to get to network crystallization point.

That’s nonsense (respectfully). People don’t trust the government but they have father mother master syndrome and they’ll take this digital money if it’s ten times better than what they have.

Good luck getting the eyeballs to follow. Unless there is a coordinated diaspora from top creators, it’s unlikely. Switching costs are too annoying and the network of value remains on YouTube.

Just say digital gold. Because even my 71 year old father understands this and anybody who is GetCPA is probably a grandpa or a defiant millennial professional who is actually interested, but just resistant.
I tend to believe people who say these things are outside of an age that gives them an inherent acceptance and understanding as to what this is. The demo/psycho is the same as gamers. Last I checked the oldest among that group are turning 38/40.

What the overwhelming majority outside this bubble are thinking when walking past this Kiosk...
(At least this is the reality today)
I would say that this is the difficulty equivalent to reconstituting Paris Hilton’s brand equity. Just rely on Greed and time with Bitcoin. Circumstantial progress will normalize it to the consensus paradigm eventually—after Apple, Facebook, and the banks go after the digital cash proposition.

You will realize why this is significant when you are older. It can happen really young for some people. Maturity. 
After the first comment I would have just admitted to being an asshole if it was just a bad day. Or I contact them privately. You see no issue with that behavior in your current stage of evolution.
It’s all good, dude. Just be nice. I know you know that is correct. And so you’re going the right way. If not, come back and read your tonation, etc. in a week.

You were not nice on the internet. 
A man slapped you and said be nice. 
You are now defending your position and qualifying why it is okay to be dick. And you’re insulating that with your opinion on wealth, which doesn’t matter at all. I know you see all this. 
So the right thing to do, would just be to ignore me and apologize privately to the kid you were giving a shit sandwich to. That’s what I think the right thing to do is. And I think it would make you feel better to clarify that you didn’t mean to come off like an ass, and just make sure he is good. I would do that. You do what you want. It’s your life.

But it does lock the perception model into in game currency and that’s my point.
I agree it’s a good place for the concept to spawn because it’s so easy to introduce, but no game has done shit with this. Like Helix credits from Ubisoft. It’s like a conversion system for all of those deeds and optical labor from any game in their galaxy. And you can use it to buy items, etc. 
I don’t know where this could spawn where it could ever escape the perception model of where it was born no matter what the organizational principle is.

He’s probably old. He’s a CPA. Look at the demographics. His brain cannot understand digital cash. He can understand commercial space flight and somewhat believes in Starship Troopers as a possible future scenario.  But he cannot yet conceive of digital cash or how that financial system might be erected. He only sees Vegas, and he’s 100% correct. 
Not that Bitcoin has any future as digital cash. It’s absolutely worthless currency for buying drugs and people online, no value at all, right?
I believe when they die off. After commercial space flight, we may actually get our digital cash. 
He will fully accept it when it comes from Apple or Facebook or a bank. Free money? No way. We’re way too stupid for that. 
@_date: 2019-04-12 20:55:07
It is not your job to be rude to people and tell them they are poor because they have victim mentality. If you want to be helpful to people, don’t insult them. And definitely don’t close your point with an insult. The framing was terrible. And it’s because you want to be right. Who cares, kid?

The problem with gaming currency is that it will get locked into this as a perception model. So even if that is a viable distribution vector it gets trapped.

The length of this is too long to read. I won’t read any of it. And I doubt anybody else will.  There simply is no time for stuff like this. Unless it’s important. Is this important?
@_date: 2019-04-12 21:10:43
I don’t think you’re actually insane, I think that you are wasting your time.
Just try not to care so much. Because you have no control over your behavior when you get pushback. Or you think it is not important, which is how I knew you were a lad.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:13:30
Mmmmmm thanks for your kind wishes. We have a true believer here. Your criticisms are valid though.  Pay attention to Grin. That seems like a good project for you. 
@_date: 2019-04-12 21:25:58
It’s fine. I’m just not going to read any of it. That’s why I am saying it is insane.
But in the sense that it is a waste of time. Like me replying to you is a huge waste of time because it’s not building towards anything and you might reply back and we could just keep doing that. 
Who cares is what I am saying. But be nice is just a general rule and you don’t have to be, but it would make you a more effective communicator. Maybe you’re just having a bad day. Who knows. I am just saying I have done what you are doing and then I said sorry right after. 
Like I did when I called you insane. But because I wanted you to know that I don’t mean it literally.  I mean that this is an insane waste of time to. Write this incredibly long nonsense towards nothing. For me it’s a bunch of crap. You pushing that in my face and happening it in, does not make it more believable for me. It makes me want to get away, or worse, engage to wreck you, which is what you did when you were talking about tears etc. 
Do you think he came away better from that? He thinks you’re an asshole. I just think you’re young.

@_date: 2019-01-24 09:54:29
I will be shocked if the world accepts Bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Less than 1 half of 1 percent of people who have access to the internet on this earth have touched it. Bitcoin has an existential problem that presents itself if it wanted to become a medium of exchange due to its extreme consolidation. That is why Grin is tuned with their deranged emission model. Learning from “the trappings of Bitcoin” I’ve seen it referred to. Bitcoin is locked into being a store of value. Unless you think that a tiny percentage of the people on this earth should have all the money. That doesn’t make any sense.
Be fine with being digital gold.
