Not planning on buying any large amounts yet, bitcoin is something that sparked my interest so just getting my feet wet. I'm all for ease of use but I would like to support smaller exchanges as well :). Do you have any complaints about Mt Gox?
It's this kind of stuff that worries me..

I actually just met someone this evening and bought some bitcoins. It was  a really good experience. Met at starbucks, exchanged money, and a few minutes later had my bitcoins. And he gave them to me for $4 to 1BTC!

I was considering setting up a Dwolla account. Is Dwolla slow? Or is CampBX just slow to accept the funds?
