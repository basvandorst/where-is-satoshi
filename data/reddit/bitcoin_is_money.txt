It will be free money, but not for you but the banks.
Stupid plebs do you really think the banksters will share their profits with ya? How naive of you ?

Lemme ELI5
1) The network gets overloaded
2) People cant sell their coins
3) There is no supply on the market
4) The price skyrockets
5) The attacker goes bankrupt
6) The network is restored, and the price is now ultra high

They might hate bitcoin because it threatens their fake derivative profits and bond holdings.
Who knows they might attempt to do this.

You dont need to buy coins for the market to go up.
The few sellers left will just bid the price up, and the askers will follow. But since only a few trades will happen the demand will go out of proportion with the supply, therefore the price can really climb to the sky.

Why would it go back to the old price ,when the attacker just spent many millions of dollars pumping up the price essentially by buying bitcoin and flooding it.
New information gets into the market, the equilibrium shifts above

Alright, lets hope some crazy billionaire attempts to do this, and then we will have practical evidence.
@_date: 2016-07-14 10:31:38
Please do this, it would be so good, the price would skyrocket and we would all be happy.
The attacker would lose all his money and go cry in his bed.

This guy really needs to lose some weight
@_date: 2016-07-14 10:29:18
blablabla who cares what random people's opinions are about bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-07-14 13:41:49
First of all the attacker has to buy coins for a few million dollars, so that is already a pin up.
Then you have a huge rally, which will probably have a little correction after the attack ends, but then all speculators will join seeing that the price goes up.
They will literally climb out under the rocks to buy bitcoin, from all over the world. When the speculators and opportunists are going crazy, then you will know that the price will go up
You know the types of crazy folks that sell their family house to buy bitcoin, those type of maniacs

Second that.
We are tired of crappy middleman and parasites that want to leech off our privacy

Except with every thrust up in price new peoples join, new entrepreneurs, new customers, new developers, new inventors. So if the price goes up it can brink more value (that will manifest itself later), than what the price currently shows.
So if an attack can keep the price at 100,000$ for 1 week for example, i guarantee you , people would climb out under rocks to grab some bitcoins.
They will just claim some IOU from the exchanges in the meantime, and probably many scams will happen too, but it will definitely be positive in the long run
