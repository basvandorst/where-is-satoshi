The place your looking for is DigitMint Inc. They're the ones who put up the ad on South Campbell. They're located further south on Campbell next to Diventures.

The KYC is required AFTER the user “creates” the account so there could quite a few spam accounts counted in the figure

Copying and pasting this from another post that I commented on
I'm 17 and been buying Bitcoin since 13 so here's my advice.
* LocalBitcoins - Do the deposit cash into bank account transactions where you just deposit money into the seller's account and you get Bitcoin. Don't worry, they have escrow. Just make sure you're buying from a reputable seller.
* Uphold - I just learned about this one yesterday. Uphold doesn't care if your under-18 so just signup and link your bank.
I got some other techniques that would be frowned upon by the mods so PM me if you want to know.

I started mining Bitcoin when I was 13 and working with smart contracts when I was 16... we do exist.

The amount of bitcoin apps on WP is quite suprising

If you can get yourself to a local credit union you could probably buy Bitcoin with cash from someone on LocalBitcoins. You wouldn't have to meet then face to face, you would just deposit cash into their account and they will send Bitcoin to your wallet.

Yah it’s called the ability to codify rules inside a public ledger aka smart contacts. If you don’t consider that valuable then your a lost cause. Consider gold, it’s easier to understand for someone like you.

Ethereum is innovating in top of Bitcoin thus its an advancement...

Or I actually care about building the ecosystem and not just taking a piss like you. You sit here and leech. You don't provide anything to the crypto community.

If you don't see any innovation, even after I've shown multiple times the innovation across different chains, then you must be more blind than Hellen Keller. Do some research you nut
@_date: 2019-10-30 04:12:57






Aight so you don't believe in the innovation that led to the device that you're utilizing to voice your asinine opinions? Aight.. case closed.
@_date: 2019-10-29 19:56:30
Your comment contained no facts. Being blind sighted to what innovation entails in this industry and simply spewing out that new advancements are “shitcoins” shows how childish you are.
@_date: 2019-10-29 19:02:14
Why even comment with this childish shit
@_date: 2019-10-30 03:52:06
Aight chump, by your logic ever printer after the Gutenberg printing press is a “shit printer”. Everything after dialup is “shiternet”. Every telephone after the rotary dialer is a “shit phone”. While your at it, go back to an agrarian lifestyle with horse drawn carriages.
@_date: 2019-10-30 03:58:55
Yah it's called innovation.. how in the world is that a foreign idea. Iterative design is part of software development. This is why gold is good for someone as feeble minded as you. If you can't come to grips with advancements in DIGITAL currency then you have no place here.

Tron created scaling smart contracts with low and sometimes free transaction fees. That’s innovation you half whit

So I'm 17 and the way I get around the restrictions is by generating a burner card on Privacy.com(funded by your bank) and adding that card to Coinbase. You get a $50 weekly without any verification. Create multiple cards and multiple accounts and bam you got Bitcoin.
