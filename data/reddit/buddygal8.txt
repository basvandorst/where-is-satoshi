You can withdraw from vault to wallet on Coinbase desktop not through phone app. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:25:41
yes the ladies!! :-)
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:30:21
I would not even call it a correction. Nothing to get nervous about. Supply and demand. It will always go up. Invest whatever you can without getting worried of losing. HODL!  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:36:01
Or sooner :-)
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:12:31

@_date: 2017-03-09 03:30:15
Yea I think I better stay away from Xapo. :-/
As for having an extra debit card on hand I do recommend Shift card. Connects directly with Coinbase. I also have it for emergency and already test it out for purchasing at retail store and ATM for withdrawal.Smooth transaction and I like the fact when I make a transaction I get a quick text on my phone for the activities I've made. :-) 
I just ordered myself a card from bitpay as well so I'll see how that goes.. 
@_date: 2017-03-09 18:57:37

Wow!! That is awesome! I try to save little here and there to buy btc. If you don't mind to share the wealth so I can go back to school I'd greatly appreciate it ��
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:29:46
I’m right with you! I’ve been hodling since 2014 myself so from averaging $300-800  then going up from $1000-3500 and back down to $1500 back up to $3000 and now we’re close to $10,000 is just amazing. I remember back those yrs we could not wait for this day to happen. For some reason I could already imagining end of 2018  1 BTC will be $80,000-$100,000 
That’s right I’m going to say it first end of 2018 my prediction 1BTC will be $80,000- $100,000 ��
To the Mooon!!!
