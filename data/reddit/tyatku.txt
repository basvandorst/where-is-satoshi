Satoshi wanted every home to be able to mine bitcoin. I hate this ASICS are good for the network rubbish. The average joe can't mine bitcoin anymore. That is an obvious problem that few here can muster the courage to accept.

Destroys the reason I thought bitcoin had potential: decentralization. Lost my faith in it

This information I send over the internet is essentially electrons being transmitted over a network. Electrons have mass. The same is true for the information identifying each Bitcoin, or fraction of it. Also, it takes quite a bit of energy to produce Bitcoin.
