The bitcoin block chain is a public ledger. *Bitcoin* **is** *an accounting system* that is proven to work. In other words, the essence of bitcoin is accounting.
Any government entity making transactions through a public blockchain (bitcoin or otherwise) could easily be audited. No funds would go "missing" because it would be obvious exactly which address the funds went to and where they came from. These facts would make it easy to find who was responsible for sending the funds to an unauthorized address. How? Because you know who has the keys for every government address.
In the case of MtGox, no one knows who had the keys to the addresses, or even if the addresses were protected by keys.
The MtGox issue is not one of accounting. It is one of security.
So if a public blockchain is so superior to internal accounting systems, then why doesn't the government use it? That's easy, a public blockchain is simply too transparent for a government.

A Ponzi scheme needs a Ponzi, first of all. A Ponzi takes money from new investors based on promises of a return. The Ponzi keeps the money. For returns, the Ponzi simply credits accounts in a ledger kept exclusively by the Ponzi. If an investor makes a withdrawal, then the Ponzi takes money from the Ponzi's own funds and gives it to the investor. When too many investors simultaneously go to the Ponzi for withdrawals, the Ponzi scheme folds.
I hope you get from that description that the Ponzi scheme requires a Ponzi. It's a tough idea to wrap one's mind around, I know. Here it is, shorter:
No Ponzi, No Ponzi Scheme.
Now, if you take any other type of investment, and can (1) identify a Ponzi (an actual single person), (2) the centralized and falsified ledger, and (3) Ponzi's own store of ill-gotten funds, then you likely have a Ponzi scheme.
If you can't do that, then you don't have a Ponzi scheme.
One more time: No Ponzi, No Ponzi scheme.
Now, before you call something a "Ponzi Scheme", make sure you describe (1) who is the Ponzi, (2) what is the centralized and falsified ledger, and (3) where is the Ponzi's store of funds.

Look, stock is tangible, it's, you know, "backed" by something. See, when you walk into a corporation with a stock certificate in your hand you can immediately trade it for tangible objects in the company. For example, you might be able to get some pencils, or a ruler. If the stock is real valuable, you can get some alone time with one of the better looking employees.
Try that with bitcoin!!!

From what I get, TC is susceptible to a brute force attack because the low-difficulty key expansion doesn't require much from the attacker. Passwords like "asdf1234" and "ewifafav" can probably get hacked easily.
So it depends on the password. If it's 000000000000000000, then it's probably not safe. If it is something like "3;:'do8zd/C7{ then it's not going to get brute-forced any time soon.

*"Consumers should not invest any money they aren’t prepared to lose, and the volatility of Bitcoin’s price against the dollar is high, though it will fall over time."*
This last "it" is a dangling pronoun. Of course the volatility will fall, but the passage could be read that Bitcoin's price will fall or that the dollar will fall.
Other than that, it's a good read.

2500 alphanumeric characters seems absurd., which yields 9.5e4481 combinations (95 with 4481 trailing zeros).
Correct is about 14 alpha-numeric characters. If UTF has 1.112e6 characters, then in the 62 character [A-Za-z0-9] set (which I'll call {62}), each UTF character would require 3.373 of the {62} set:  3.373=log_62(1.112e6). Thus, a 4 character UTF would be about 13.5 characters in {62}.
The total combinations is 1529393103780039377289216, which, if you could process 10 billion every second, would require up to 4.8 million years to run through the whole set.

Here is how to understand this statement:
Buffet would flunk a student that gave a high value to an internet company. However, he would also flunk a student that gave a low or even 0 value to an internet company.
His position was not that he thought that internet companies were overvalued (he'd have to flunk himself if he thought that). He thought that you simply couldn't estimate the value of an internet company.
Let's look at it another way. Anyone who foresaw the 2000 crash and said "internet companies are overvalued" would have been flunked by Buffett.

People get accused of being shills when they go from thread to thread saying the same thing relentlessly. Mostly they throw up strawmen, claiming that anything that can be construed as positive is part of a larger cult.
For example, someone might say "bitcoin can help people in some countries where the currency is not stable". Then those accused of being shills say something like "you guys are circle drinking coolaid jerkers. You think bitcoin is going to save the world. It's a ponzi scheme". Then they get called a shill, and the other shills claim that anyone who says shill is drinking coolaid and part of a circle jerk.
The detractors never offer any insight, only that somehow they see clearly and anyone who doesn't agree is drinking coolaid. For these people, a downtick in the price of bitcoin is its demise while an uptick is evidence of a ponzi scheme.

The probability for finding a block hash doesn't change with the number of tries. It's like spinning a roulette wheel. Even if you get 32 blacks in a row, the chance of getting black on the 33rd spin is still just less than 1/2, exactly the same as each of the first 32 spins. Thus, adding transactions doesn't start the process anew, per se. It starts anew every time a new nonce is tried.

Find a bitcoiner whose money you would like to have. They will loan you a bitcoin. Decide on a date to pay it back.

In two years, or whenever, when you think that bitcoin will be 0. Buy a bitcoin for like 3 cents and give it back to your friend.
That's pure profit!

I'd say MtGox got regulated into nonexistence.
Or do you mean "regulated" as in a federal bailout, like with Bear Stearns, AIG, and others? Can we make you pay for that?
Edit: You know, I just had a shiver of joy thinking about how the free market eliminated a badly run business. They failed away before they got too big to fail. Look, little tears of joy in my eyes.

It should be open source if it is being used at all. If already in use, then it is security by obscurity, which is not a cryptographic solution.

You can't take the stock into a corporation and trade it for the real estate. At the end of the day, it's simply a certificate that entitles the holder to dividends. Except that the certificate may be paper, it is entirely virtual.
In the event that a company goes insolvent, the stockholders do not get proceeds if the company is liquidated by creditors.

Even a $1000 (note the "$") earnest money transaction is held in escrow during a house buy.
If the Feds backed that $1000, there would be no need for escrow with any dollar transaction.

Because it simply isn't a parsimonious explanation.
Academic writers become meticulous about their writing. They cringe at even the smallest mistakes. About the only bad writing habit they never suitably address is a lack of economy with words.
Grammar, spelling, and clarity are essential for survival in academics. And when survival is on the line, writers get compulsive about correctness.

OPERATOR: Good afternoon Thermos, what may I help you with today.
HAxOR: Yeah. It looks like I'm locked out of my server.
OPERATOR: That's terrible.
HAxOR: Yup. I need to get back in to fix some stuff.
OPERATOR: I understand. How are you locked out Thermos?
HAxOR: I lost my password or something. I usually keep it here on my desk. It's too hard to remember. I have hard passwords for security because bitcointalk is real important.
OPERATOR: Yes. Here at [redacted] we value security very very much. It's like the most important thing we do.
HAxOR: Okay. Cool. Can I get a new password.
OPERATOR: Have you tried the password reset function at the control panel.
HAxOR: That's the thing. I can't get into the control panel.
OPERATOR: Oh, of course. Silly me. Let me get you your password for you. It's bitcointalk.org, correct?
HAxOR: Yeah. No dashes.

There are one or two reasonable responses here. Most "community" members can't help but mock the guy.
Honestly, it doesn't look good for the crypto community to make fun of him. I could see if he turned around and said it was bitcoin's fault or something, he'd deserve a good mocking. I'm not a fan of mocking people who make a mistake. I'm sure everyone here thinks they are "chad" or "alpha" or a "rare pepe" or something, but they just make the bitcoin community look like libertarian retards.

There is nothing special about PoW except it has very nice BFT properties, as in the chain with the most work wins.
PoS does not reproduce the financial system where bank accounts don't actually belong to the account holders.
PoS ownership is cryptographic, just like bitcoin.

The steem blockchain seizing had nothing to do with the block certification system. There was a bug in a code that invalidated any new blocks. Same thing could happen no matter if it is PoS, PoW, dPoS (you are right, it sucks), or whatever.
@_date: 2018-07-06 00:09:04
It doesn't matter about influence or any other bullshit.
What matters is:
(1) Is ownership cryptographic, i.e. does it belong to the individual or the bank
(2) Can you depend on only valid transactions being approved
PoS and PoW tie on the first. PoW has failed much more than PoS on the second through 51% attacks.
If you can think of a criterion I missed, I'd love to hear about it. But don't double down on your argumentative intensity. Get a criterion and rationale out there and then debate.
@_date: 2018-07-07 06:27:50
Okay, I'll go on.
From a practical sense, you want to send money and it to arrive at the destination, and to not be reversible. And you don't want someone to take your money without knowing your private keys. And also, the network should not have double spends.
Worrying about anything else is religion.
@_date: 2018-07-10 08:03:17
If how many "shittokens" someone has doesn't influence the things I mentioned, I don't care. Shittoken staking has been better about double spends than PoW. Plain and simple. The protocols are pretty much equivalent otherwise.
And yes, to not worry about how money functions and rather worry about the bogeyman undue influence "shittoken" holder is faith based worship.

Like this post made just yesterday at AllCrypt?
"Well, due to some apparent exploit in wordpress, someone, somehow, got into the server tonight, installed some files, and managed to empty the goddamned BTC wallet. Best I can tell it was something with that worthless pile of shit software wordpress.
I'm fucking done. I run a site, spend thousands of hours of time, thousands of dollars of my OWN money to run it, decide to shut down, and somehow, through ways I cannot even figure the hell out, someone gets in, uploads files to the server, somehow finds the goddamned BTC wallet on the network, and it appears that they slammed it with withdraw requests. Of course, the wallet is locked - but it unlocks when a withdraw is legitimately made through the site. I THINK they made a real wd on the site, and then slammed the backdoor to get the other funds out.
We had 42 BTC in the wallet. 12 was the sites. 30 was users BTC. I'm fucking done with crypto. I'll post details when I sort this fucking mess out. Not that it will matter, because no one ever actually gives a shit when something like this happens."
