So I guess they addressed the founder's concerns?
@_date: 2017-12-01 15:31:37
Which broker can I use for this?
@_date: 2018-06-22 17:39:23
Actually, "greedy" would be NOT selling.  LOL
@_date: 2018-06-22 18:22:11
So is it 18 or 13 or 12 or 10?  
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:19:23
No. $2,000.
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:46:27


Cut me some slack.  I'm a millennial.  Ok, I'll go back to playing games in my mom's basement.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:27:15
Not if you bought at the top it isnt.
@_date: 2018-06-21 12:28:43
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:28:05
Right because only positive posts that pump this shit should be allowed, right?
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:10:13
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:30:15
If you liked it at say $10,000 then you should REALLY like it at $6,000, the saying goes at least.  So why not just keep buying if you still believe in it, effectively doubling down?
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:17:02
Fool 
@_date: 2018-06-25 04:05:56
Tell that to @_date: 2018-06-24 16:25:35
Ok 
@_date: 2018-06-24 22:26:34
And I'm sure when it was at the top you same idiots where telling people to keep buying.   Did you know it was the top at the time? No, no you didn't.  Hindsight is 2020.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:18:31
So when this drops to $2,000 would I be a dumbass for buying now at $5,000?
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:20:48
Except that Amazon has a REAL business.
@_date: 2018-06-24 16:25:14
Where'd you get "single" from "average"?
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:55:44
Ouch 
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:09:09


Statement made 11 months ago.  WOOPS!
@_date: 2018-11-30 16:10:24
My point being that it's the politicians that make the laws so anything they can do to NOT line their pockets ain't gonna happen.  Look at what Jerry Brown is doing to California?  He's running it into the ground to line his own pockets of special interests. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 12:36:07
And what do you plan on doing after your money runs out since it's all tied up in that M4?
@_date: 2018-11-26 08:32:38
Bottom isn't in yet.
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:06:08


Yikes.  Don't look like this statement you made 11 months ago is holding up.
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:17:40
HAHAHAHAH man, you've got some great stuff there man!  I'll check back in with ya in 2021 and see how that $.50 Bitcoin price is treating you.
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:04:29
BAD advice...  Not even the same thing.
@_date: 2018-11-30 14:37:53
Then how will the politicians line their pockets?  
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:09:38
Theranos?  Yikes 
So, no way to believe this Yahoo then.   I bet he invested in Enron too.  LOL
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:15:18
Don't worry.   It will be below $2,000.
@_date: 2018-11-30 14:35:17
You STILL like Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-11-28 12:33:22
Because it will never get past 5k.
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:39:16
Who is Tim Draper?
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:55:25
@_date: 2018-11-28 00:37:29


Not lately!  LOL
@_date: 2018-11-30 14:43:11
Yep.   Nothing's free.
@_date: 2018-11-30 17:23:46
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:11:00


Statement made 11 months ago.  Ya, it sure has!  How many people have committed suicide over their losses?
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:55:13
@_date: 2018-03-11 12:32:20
Not looking good. LOL
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:15:12
Man, that's some REALLY strong Koolaid you're drinking!  So, if it's "only an algorithm", explain to me how that would save us from 100,000 dollar student loan debt or million dollar single family home prices?  Man, you're just spewing crap that doesn't even make sense.
@_date: 2018-11-30 14:36:28
Yay!  I live in America...
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:07:40


Yikes.  You think that's still likely?  LOL
@_date: 2018-11-30 14:44:17
LOL!  So you don't think it would require extra fuel?  
@_date: 2018-11-28 12:29:48
Well sure, I mean you can pick any arbitrary start date you like to make it fit your narrative but the reality is it doesn't mean shit when the majority of people bought at the peak and now they lost everything. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:16:53
Don't worry.  Your waiting won't be in vein in a year or two.
@_date: 2018-11-21 04:56:08
Hold on till What? When it's zero?  HAHAHAHAHAHA
@_date: 2018-11-25 22:20:18
But I thought you could buy a pizza from some place somewhere?
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:50:33
Agreed with everything but the bounce part.
@_date: 2018-03-13 17:07:40
Just another exit, that's all.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:39:17
It was the Tether scam that propped up the price.  
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:50:11
Save your money.
@_date: 2018-11-28 03:10:13
I think your chart is upside down!
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:44:12
Jealous that you've lost 1/2 your value in Bitcoin? Ya, ok.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:34:41
Google it
@_date: 2018-11-30 14:42:38
It's not free buddy.  You're paying for it through diesel fuel.
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:36:37
You bag hodlers are really grasping at straws aren't you?
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:11:25


Statement made 11 months ago.  WOOPS!!  As far as I know, government are STILL printing money.  So what went wrong?
@_date: 2018-02-10 23:12:00
Let's see you keep doing that.
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:58:37
Let's see how the longs try to spin this one. LOL
@_date: 2018-04-09 18:07:34
Keep grasping at those straws, bagholder.  I'll check in next week at $5,000 to see how you're holding up.
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:29:51
So she wants to lose money?
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:59:16
never seeing that price again!
@_date: 2018-04-09 15:59:32
Zero is more likely
@_date: 2018-04-05 07:30:41
And so will it's value.
@_date: 2018-04-02 04:46:48
So she'll be getting $50?
@_date: 2018-04-09 16:00:04
Desperate longs
@_date: 2018-04-09 23:16:10
I didn't delete shit.  It was the mods.  I stand by what I said.
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:56:25
Why not just save your money and put it all in at $1,000, instead of buying on the way down?
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:56:32
90% assuming the only other option was buying at the high.  How about not buying at all?
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:57:11
Hope your other 3 sources can sustain you.
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:36:51
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:59:25
Won't mean much when Bitcoin drops to zero. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 12:52:21
You got some pair of balls.
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:18:30
So it's smarter if you buy it now and it drops in 1/2 next year?
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:40:58
Not true at all.  Better to buy in bulk from Costco once a month and save tons of money.
@_date: 2018-12-04 01:03:31
Only people making money is the people charging transaction fees on this junk.
@_date: 2018-12-12 02:16:49
And drop in value of crypto!
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:01:11
It's vaporware.  Move on.
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:37:31
Not when it will be below $2,000 early 2019.
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:23:48
So your let's just say $1,500 paycheck you got last month is now only worth about $1,100?  How is that good?
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:35:45
Piece of shit Camry.  How appropriate.   He'll be driving a Corrola next year.
@_date: 2018-12-01 03:42:52
Dude.  What fucking planet are you on?  Because you're making zero sense.
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:35:07
Good one!
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:28:48
Sure, if that makes you feel better.
@_date: 2018-12-05 13:31:36
Yikes.  I'll check back in with you next month to see if you still feel the same.
@_date: 2018-12-11 01:32:46


Until it hits $2,000.
@_date: 2018-12-10 01:21:42
Came here to say just that!
@_date: 2018-12-10 15:55:10
Most irrational statement I've ever read.   Since you qualified your statement by saying no matter what happens in the future, what if that something you bought for 3500 ends up being worth 0 and that something you bought for 20,000 ends up being worth 20,000 or even 21,000 or even 19,500?  Which is the smarter investment here?  And I'll remind you you said the 3500 would ALWAYS be the smarter investment. 
@_date: 2018-12-10 00:40:13
You got an extra 0 in there.
@_date: 2018-12-06 13:41:37
And 1 penny will always be 1 penny.  What's your point?
@_date: 2018-12-12 02:15:57
If he had to manually enter the numbers then something is wrong with his setup.
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:41:07
You also have to factor in your extra time and gas to drive back and forth to the store multiple times a week vs once per month.
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:16:22
So what does all this mean when Bitcoin drops to zero?
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:19:18
Since you told us how republicans are supposedly so fucked up, why don't you tell us how the democrats Are?
I thought saving money was a good thing? How is hodling your bitcoin not considered hoarding?
