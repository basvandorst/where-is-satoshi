Then move to a country where this doesn't happen, move to Nicaragua or the Cayman Islands or some other backwater country where the government doesn't do this shit.

"we" being based off the fact that we live in a representative Republic. The majority of the country voted in the last election. Their faith in a broken system fucked them, and by extension us. Wether you believe that the 41.4% of the population that didn't vote "consented" or not is really what this comes down to. I choose to still live here, because I feel like I'm better off here than in Germany or France or wherever. They hypothetical "you" that chooses to stay but "doesn't consent" is giving consent by staying. Like, your not so against it happening that you make any effort to stop it.

But we consent to it, technically it's just really rough sex

I'm not trying to convince anyone. You look at it how you want and I'll do the same. Don't really change anything in the end though, does it?

That's kind of the downside to living in a society where you vote. What you vote for won't always win. Imo you consent to it by not leaving the country. It's like a sugar daddy, that hot 20something girl sure as fuck doesn't like banging the 75 year old millionaire, but she does it because the alternative isn't as easy.

If you don't live in a Republic, then you don't live in the US, so this law doesn't really affect you. 
And if McDonald's one day decided "were going to take half your income when you come into one of our restaurants" nobody would go to McDonald's unless they had a way around it. Nobody would go there. My rationale isn't any more retarted than your example is.

Why? Because I don't have the illusion that I can make everyone believe what I do, or that the way I look at the world is the only correct way to look at it? 
Whatever, why would I care what your opinion of me is, lol.

They won't change until we radically change how this country is run. Find me a group who's actually trying to take money out of politics and I'll throw every ounce of my being behind them. 
All the ones I've seen gain zero traction and go nowhere, because the US is run by oligarchs who control our entire existence, or damned close to it. They keep such a large percentage of the population essentially zombified and complacent that change on that scale is going to take extremely drastic action by people who are willing to die to change the system.

This guy understands government. They still fuck you, they just use lube when you cry enough.
