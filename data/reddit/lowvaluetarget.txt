The key thing to look for when looking at wallets is where is the private key stored and who has control of it
Generally speaking, wallets online are controlled by third parties meaning you aren't in total control of your money. If the site shuts down voluntarily or otherwise your funds are gone. 
Those wallets stored on your computer generally store your private keys on your hard drive. Some, however, do so in an unencrypted fashion, meaning that if someone with physical or remote network access gets that key, they can restore your wallet on another machine and have full control of the funds within. The most secure computer and phone wallets encrypt your private key with a password only you know somewhat mitigating theft of your private key. 
Hardware wallets are physical devices where your encrypted private key never leaves the device mitigating electronic theft even further.
The nuances of wallets to much deeper than needs to be said in this post, but suffice it to say that until you can get your hands on a hardware wallet, a computer wallet like exodus.io is probably one of your safest options in your situation right now. 
Note: when creating/backing up a local wallet, you'll be presented with a 12 or 24 word cryptographic seed. Write this down and store at least two copies in an extremely secure way away from where your wallet resides (e.g. Not in the same building as your computer). In the event of a catastrophe such as a hard drive crash, house fire, computer theft, or something else), you'll be able to restore your wallet and access your funds with that phrase. 
Hope this helps

I've made 30% in two days, low capital though. 
Set long term goals and put in what you can. Research, diversify, then research some more. 
Cryptocurrency is still in its infancy. You won't buy a Lambo tomorrow, but there's still plenty of opportunity.

Research hardware wallets, order one, understand how to back them up and use it. 
Until then, exodus.io wallet with a strong password and a safe backup of your 12 word seed will be adequate. 
Use Gemini to buy the coins and transfer them to exodus after you buy them.

Gemini (my preference) or coinbase for fiat to btc or eth. 
Bittrex, bitfinex and/or kraken for btc or eth to altcoins. 
Hardware wallets, exodus.io and official wallets for storage.

There won't be any change until he's actually the President and some policies are enacted/trade deals restructured.
