I had the same problem when bitcurex was hacked. I thought I lost my money, but after "reset blockchain" in multibit menu it showed up. It takes a while

Multibit is quite good - don't have to download whole blockchain (fast), no need for installation just run program and you can check pgp signature of downloaded archive. I don't know other desktop wallets, but if you don't need offline message signing or multisig wallet it's enough. Security of your bitcoins depends mostly on OS not just a wallet software. Main threats are malware and keyloggers. That's why I had never stored bitcoins on any microsoft or apple OS. It's just too easy to catch virus.
Disadvantage of Multibit is no option to modify transaction fee, but it's only relevant if you do lot of small transactions.
For mobile I recommend Mycelium with enourmous advanced features such as nice keys management, ads for local btc traders based on localisation, loading private key from offline wallet and deleting it right after (but i don't trust this feature enough to use it).
I also like Hive which has great layout, but is too simple (only one address and no PIN feature) so it's good only for small volume transactions.
