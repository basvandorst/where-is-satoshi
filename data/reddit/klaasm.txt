this method completely misses users on exchanges where all BTCs are kept in one wallet!

@_date: 2014-03-27 07:06:15

awesome. as a futher idea. maybe you could do matching designs for each side of the paper. with the private key on one side and the public key on the other.
btw why did't you include this one  ? Its my absolute favorite!

You can interpret it as virtually no fees in comparison to credit cards. Also AFAIK you don't have to pay the bitcoin transaction fees. The transaction will just take longer to be processed.

I don't understand this market anymore. Your service is basically what everyone was waiting for, but it had zero effect on the bitcoin price.

another exchange gone broke. the media is going to love this
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:15:36
that is the funnierst thing I have seen for a long time!!

those are not new 'supply'. If anything they should be substracted in this calculation, because these are coins which are atm excluded from the market and not up for anyone to by or sell

great so instead of getting my BTC back I get goxBTC which are worth about 0.05 BTC.

could it be that every drop is a weekend?
@_date: 2014-01-14 15:40:58
i agree with most of your arguments. still i ve made the experience that the high price is a mayor reason for the uninfomed to dismiss bitcoins entirely and dont even bother to get informed on the subject. 
my main concern is getting more users. if the price goes up because of that i dont see any harm.

in sync and set to the highest fee

hm tried to pay with Bitcoin, but the transaction took more than 15 minutes and now BitPay says my invoice is expired...

I always thought the crash in may 2013 was because mt gox was overwhelmed by the trading volume and went offline for about a day
