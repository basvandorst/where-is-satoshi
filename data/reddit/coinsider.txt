It is not about tricking. With any currency, say with the dollar, if you had to pay $0.00056 you would have a rediculous currency. Not practical. End of story. In any country if the currency is too inflated or too deflated, people start using a more practical unit. And the government usuallu follow the new convention. We need to make this decision for our Bitcoin economy. 
 I think they say that the price of a Big Mac should be represtable in a number between 1 and 10 otherwise there is an issue.  Surely it is not scientific but you get the idea. Bitcoin concept is overwhelming enogh. We should not expect everyone to also get better at working with decimal points.

On my iPhone: 
It is not working with Chrom at all. Keeps hiding the keyboard for entring the PIN.
with Safari it gets stuck in setting PIN screen.
Useless for me as I cannot even create a wallet. Will check it again in another 6 months or so. Looks like you guys need a lot more testing on the front-end.

Google "Cryptsy negative balance" as just one example of how they don't give a shit about so many people who have money stuck on their exchange or lost money due to Cryptsy "technical issues" i.e. Theft. 
They should not be in this business.

Yes, iPhone definitely won't be on my list when I want to look for a new phone. But remember some people are stuck with iPhone for the time being and guess what, blockchain.info works fine in browsers.
Also, the only reason I tried my phone to create a wallet was that on my work computer your website didn't work (same problem, stuck in PIN page) and I thought OK it is acceptable as there are some restrictions when I am behind a firewall and antivirus and policies and all at work. Again blockchain.info works fine on my work laptop. So please spend time on fixing the issues. My suggestion is spend less time reading users' history on reddit and spend more time on testing. I wish you best of luck. Seriously.

*Here is my hasty attempt at translating the text:*
Deputy of Center of Regulation in Cyber Space revealed that we will see Bitcoin regulation in 2014. Bitcoin is a digital currency that can be acquired through exchanges or other means such as viewing ads on the Internet [!?]
According to Fars News Agency, Bitcoin is a digital currency that is getting popular quite rapidly on the Internet and is not controlled by any government or corporation. 
Bitcoin allows the users to have peer to peer irreversible payments. Transactions are instant and without third-parties with very low fees.  Sanctions do not rule who can or cannot open a Bitcoin account.
There are also websites that give away free Bitcoins to their users [wah?!]. These websites are mainly based on gambling. 
People can then convert their Bitcoins to other currencies or shop online with them.
Now the Deputy of Centre of Regulation in Cyber Space says that passing regulations in regards to Bitcoin is their focus in 2014. 
Saeed Mahdeyoon told Fars News Agency: 
“Fiat money rules and regulations are not applicable to Bitcoin. They are freely exchanged on the Internet and bypass all the existing rules and challenge the global economy. This virtual currency is gaining traction by day and whether we like it or not, the world is moving towards it. Therefore, it is best to have some necessary regulation in place in order to minimize the negative impacts and at the same time benefit from its advantages.”
He added that various bodies such as Ministry of Finance and the Central Bank are involved in this process.

@_date: 2013-08-14 05:42:55
OK, I like constructive discussion better. If you can think of BTC as money it should be similar to Euro or Yen or whatever. Call up IRS and tell them "Look I bought some Euros and came to France, but all of a sudden everything is much cheaper than what they used to be. So much so that I can buy a Ferrari now. Should I pay you guys tax?" and be kind enough to share with us their response. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 23:16:45
haha interesting!
1. Buy BTC on localbitcoins from Aussies. I am in Sydney and I am a seller  
2. Put an Advertisement in there to buy and then when you have enough BTC another one to sell. We want as many people involved in Bitcoin as we can.
Best of luck

Why imagine? We all should set a date and just DO it. 
Someone please create  get consensus on some date(s) to buy large amount of bitcoin and then boom.... I am sure the price will jump in anticipation.
Also, just in case, make sure you have a page for the implications that declaring bankruptcy has in different jurisdictions. Man this is exciting :)
@_date: 2013-06-27 02:00:21
Exactly!! If everyone compares Bitcoin protocol to TCP/IP then exchanging BTC for fiat is like  printing and storing the web pages that you browse! Sure, sometimes you have to but the whole point of the Internet is to get rid of paper. The whole point of BTC is to get rid of fiat.
@_date: 2016-07-01 06:02:36
We don't. you just have to trust them I suppose.
@_date: 2013-07-03 07:17:14
If a bank wants to invest in Bitcoin, they cannot put it on their balance sheet as an "Asset" because the regulator don't recognize it (well yet!). With this ETF they can easily get exposure to Bitcoin and have something in their balance sheet that everyone is used to. It has great implications for Bitcoin indeed.

There is always a risk on clients that you don't do the job or don't deliver the service or product that you have promised. With CC or PayPal etc. they can hit you with ChargeBacks. If any company is willing to give you BTC they will bear this risk. I am not talking about you in particular but the moment they say they give BTC for customers CC they open a big door of opportunity for the bad guys. They can of course overcome this by charging a premium to make up for the possible losses. But this is not what you want coz you'll be better off buying BTC off market IMHO
@_date: 2013-11-04 04:40:11
you are full of it

Wishful thinking
@_date: 2013-08-14 03:23:11
easy cowboy. If you buy some Euro now and go to Europe for holiday then the price of everything in Euro drops, there is no capital gain. Barter is when one side is NOT money. If they say BTC IS money then there is no barter. You misunderstood one principle about BTC being money or not and took 3 wrong points from my comment? They are all the same thing.
By buying BTC you are going to a BTC land for holiday. If the prices drop there lucky you. No capital gain unless a) you do trading with BTC or b) you convert it to USD to buy your shit or c) they say BTC is NOT money and buying TV with BTC is barter and subject to tax
@_date: 2013-08-22 06:17:37
I've got a feeling this is what's gonna happen. Sorry for raisig some hopes here guys, looks like PayPal is a no no for bitcoiners

You are right but I suggest you at least read the abstract of that academic paper.

better than nothing for the time being
@_date: 2013-08-14 06:16:11
I didn't say you did. So this is interesting. Just to clarify: 
*Your company wants to buy product X which has a value of EUR1,000
*Your company buys EUR1,000 , each for $1.5 ($1,500)
*A while later when the payment needs to be done, product X is still EUR1,000 but USD has become weaker and EUR1=$2 now. Your company still has to give all of that EUR1,000 to buy the product but according to you there is also a capital gain tax on the currency exchange that needs to be paid?
Is your ex-company still around?
PS. I answer your questions but you don't answer mine and repeat yours. What will happen to my tourist again?
@_date: 2013-08-22 01:19:28
This is a fair point but they do not earn their huge revenue by offering insurance. They can transform into a giant escrow system within bitcoin ecosystem.

I won't sell my bitcoins until I become a bitcoin millionaire. And... I have 10 bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-14 09:10:22
Actually if you do the math with the amount of money in circulation and if bitcoin is to become mainstream, 100 grand is not unreasonable. 
@_date: 2013-07-02 06:09:33
I have no problem with it. The thing is BTC has the capability to be Gold and Silver and buck and dime. If BTC community don't use this capability then LTC is will and should play this role.

We really need to promote this idea. Why are we even talking about regulators and governments and banks threatening Bitcoin? It is THEM who should be afraid of our attack. 
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:28:07
And NEVER use gox again. I have been waiting for my 3 BTC withdrawal for 5 hours.

There are many different places but I would only recommend Shirtoshi because they accept Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-14 01:48:27
There is a challenging issue here. The regulators like to call Bitcoin money for various reasons one being that this way they can fit it in the existing laws for money laundering, money transmitting etc. 
On the other hand, and this is where they have to compromise, if they say bitcoin is money, then if bitcoin takes off in terms of price and adoption they won't be able to tax you. Say you buy one bitcoin now for $100 and at some point in the future bitcoin gets to $1,000.  If you don't sell your BTC for fiat, there won't be any capital gain. Effectively you have a "money" and all the prices are declining against your "money". There is no capital gain so no tax is applicable. So they will think hmm maybe bitcoin is actually an asset and is not money and here is where they get into this interesting loop...
@_date: 2013-08-22 03:10:20
@_date: 2013-07-03 04:41:45
right to the point
@_date: 2013-06-24 04:44:37

A US hosting is actually pretty common. This website is just a facilitator for people to buy and sell BTC via a counter party in Australia. 
The legal and political hurdles (yes political, some people have a conspiracy theory about Bitcoin being owned by the CIA) need to be overcome and it takes ages.

You might face a policy issue because Microsoft insist that any app that deals with money should open a browser and show that little padlock to indicate that it uses SSL. This, of course, is a deal breaker for WP BTC wallet app but I hope you can find a way around it.

This is really huge. Someone is pricing their service in BTC!!!
@_date: 2013-07-17 01:37:36
They do because Iranian Rial keeps devaluing against other currencies. It does not mean that they use it for their day to day stuff but because of the high inflation, most people hold USD, EUR, AUD or Gold, Silver etc.
Moreover, Rial fluctuates wildly against other currencies and given that Bitcion price is also very volatile, it makes sense for Iranians to buy and sell BTC with Dollar until BTC becomes more widespread in the country.
