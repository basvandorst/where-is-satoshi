That is very apparent. I would prefer someone's honest opinion that I could research myself as opposed to someone just blowing smoke up my butt. Ohh well to each their own. To the mars!

Roger that! I will and thank you

And I think that is very smart. I know btc will be up to 9k and way beyond so you have nothing to worry about.

So what is it yout fear exactly? Caution, a drop to below 7k or that the Earth isnt flat? it is only my opinion, I thought that was the point of this forum. My apologies snowflake, didn't mean to scare you.

An increase in wallets and interest in blockchain technology is always a good thing however just like the number of credit cards doesn't dictate what your credit score is, the number of wallets created doesn't dictate the value of btc. im just looking at historical data and there is always a very noticeable spike in volume during a significant upswing. Just because we saw a bounce at the triple bottom line does not mean we can't dip down further. The last spike in value was as big as this current one before a plunge.

Since you were nice enough to say thank you. I just wanted to say you're whalecum ;)

We are bouncing nicely and easy headed to 14k! Lambos for eveyone..  ignore the rest of this message as it only applies to those who actaully want to make as much profit as possible. These whales look at the same charts as us. They know that most everyone here has a concensus that we have hit the "bottom" and its buy time for everyone. If I was a stealthy whale waiting  patiently for an ideal time to dump... hmm, I wonder when that might be?

The volume is not high enough for a breakout  IMO. Still waiting for that spike before I buy. It's more likely we move to the upper stratosphere far short of the moon "unless you're a flat earther, in which case you are already close to the moon and deserve the following. Then we plunge down to the Earth's core where some of you will obviously get burned. Looks more likely to me we go down to at or below 6.8k. Better to wait until we are on the upswing than to jump in not knowing which way this is headed.

You are exactly right. I admit I could be wrong. However if it did drop down to 6.5k would you not have preferred to buy at the lowest point? Buying in on a strong upswing you are going to make a profit. My point is don't jump the gun. I don't claim to be a professional at crypto investing. However I did stay at a holiday Inn express!

using [tradingview.com]( and using only 2 pitchforks i have predicted exactly when the next pivot is going to be down the exact hour. which way it goes i have no idea, but i know when to buy or short.  the chart matches the exact last dip and shows to the tick when the next one is. i was blown away when i saw how perfectly everything matches up.
