You paid 126 satoshis/Byte. According to bitcoinfees.21.co you need 260 satoshis/Byte for a fast confirmation and it is expected you will have to wait ~7 hours for a confirmation on your tx.

Stupid? Borrowing inflationary currency and hoarding deflationary currency sounds smart to me. A $3k loan is ~$60/month for 5 years...very affordable exposure to potentially huge long term gains.

Those parameters provide higher capacity at the expense of lower security. 
The way I see this playing out is Lightning Network will be the "off-chain" scaling solution and Litecoin will be the "side-chain" scaling solution when atomic swaps mature. 
I think Litecoin is in the "top 5" blockchains because people see the value of a level-2 blockchain compatible with Bitcoin.

I agree. Don't blame Bitcoin because your wallet sucks. It's like blaming the Internet because you're using IE6.

It would be interesting to know how accurate these quotes actually are. According to [this]( Woodrow Wilson never said "I am a most unhappy man. I have unwittingly ruined my country."

If there are increased costs for holding bitcoin then you're doing it wrong.
