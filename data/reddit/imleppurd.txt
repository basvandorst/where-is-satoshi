@_date: 2019-06-28 15:39:41
Yeah, but this is the internet and no one knows anyone. He's a 3 month redditor what makes him have to pay his end if he loses. Wanna bet $20 that they don't pay each other? Do you trust me? Do I trust you?
@_date: 2019-06-26 19:20:36
Like 1 month.
@_date: 2019-06-28 03:26:35

Sell over the ATH though, it will correct after either hitting or sliding by. Buy back in after the dip.

Just by using the word liek you automatically look unsophisticated. At least try.
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:38:16
No, but there would definitely be a warning if something like that were to happen. Enough time to transfer funds. If there was not a warning I'm sure I wouldn't be the only one taking up arms and finding whomever seized my assets.

Wow that got real really quick. Good luck brother.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:49:59
Yeah. I'm waiting for the weak hands that don't understand the tech to buy in masses, then I'm out, until then I'm hodling. Media coverage right now is very low. Once it hits the fans like in 2017 hodling till the whales dump and then I'm gonna try to get back in anything near 10k. This is best case scenario but I think the chances are high.
@_date: 2019-06-26 17:16:51
Best worst? feeling ever
