Yet, somebody is always making profit.

There is no wealth being created by bitcoins. You just have two separate pools, where there is bitcoins in other, and the money people have paid from bitcoins. There might be illusion that bitcoins are worth more or less, but their actual worth is realized only when people sell them and get money back from the other pool. Somebody is making the profits and somebody is taking the losses. Unlike in Fiat currency.

True. I'm also trying to make my point, so these guys don't run in to the people actually working at coal mines, and start complaining about their profits that they worked so hard for. That can end ugly, unlike mean internet words from me.

Fuck off, you didn't "work hard" for them. You just left your computer on.

In that case yes, but if I buy bitcoin for 50 usd and sell it for 260 usd, the 210 usd isn't created by the bitcoin. It's simply the money somebody else paid for the bitcoin. The wealth isn't being created. It's being redistributed.

That's like pondering over not picking the right numbers at last weeks lottery.

Oh come on.
This guy has been hobbying on building computers to mine this "currency" that he probably believes on, and used up his electricity bill to generate 45 pieces of currency. Then greedy speculators inflated its value, and now he was able to sell his 45 pieces for only 2500 dollars. Do you honestly think that he earned these 2500 dollars through hard work? The 2500 dollars didn't appear from out of fucking nowhere. They came from the pockets of the people who ACTUALLY fucked up by spending their money in the speculation. And yet this guy is whining here about how he "fucked up" by gaining profits from his hobby.
And no, I didn't lose any money, I'm not mad about the course falling, I'm mad at these people thinking they were entitled to fucking fortunes because they had these bitcoins and they were more valuable yesteday than they are today.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:17:36
No. I'm ok with people speculating and redistributing the greedy people moneys. But acting like they had done hard work for those profits, or like they suddenly had lost huge fortune is ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:32:17
Thx bro, couldnt gain fortunes without your advices!
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:16:31
Lol'd at this.
[just to rub it in more] (
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:31:35
Lol, so the article comes out saying Wiklevoss are invested in bitcoins, and suddenly everything is caused by them.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:39:10
10% change in price is always 10% profit to be made for someone.
@_date: 2013-04-12 15:20:59
It's a legit currency guys! Buy up!
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:16:12
Ok, so you put in some effort, sounds like a hobby thing. How about asking your father, how he qualifies "hard work", and ask him if having computer "mine" 2500 dollars for you meets the requirements.
Oh, and let me guess? You are not going to let government touch your hard earned money either?
