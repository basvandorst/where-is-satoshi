It's not. Bitcoin isn't a currency at all right now, because if you try to buy anything with it, this happens. Right now it's just a very shaky investment scheme.
@_date: 2017-08-18 16:28:55
Like most of this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-08-12 07:21:49
Well, you're not actually, not until you exchange it into a real currency.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:31:08
It's not about the price, it's about the ease of use and the ability to actually use it. 
@_date: 2017-08-27 16:12:59
Going "all in" into bitcoin is the stupidest thing you can do.
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:24:25
We're you surprised?
@_date: 2017-08-04 14:36:34
And people wonder why bitcoin is confusing.
@_date: 2017-08-15 09:46:14
not rising anymore..
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:10:04
It's most likely gonna swing back down at some point soon so I wouldn't cancel these alerts.
@_date: 2017-09-04 19:44:36
No one really knows if these are completely safe yet, so I wouldn't call that a great replacement. Maybe just for a few months to cope with the withdrawal.
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:51:02
He's still an idiot. The fact that it went well (which we don't actually know if it did) doesn't change that.
Any person who gambles their whole life like that is an idiot.
@_date: 2018-03-27 21:03:02
There's is quite a big, incomparable difference between the two.
@_date: 2017-09-25 16:52:58
If you set them to very low (which most mobile wallets don't even allow), you have to wait hours for confirmation. And even at very low it's still more expensive that normal currency.
@_date: 2017-10-01 18:47:29
I guess I worded it wrong. They will welcome you, because they are a very polite society, but you will never be accepted as "one of their own". You will always be seen as a foreigner.
@_date: 2017-09-04 21:30:32
Well yeah, that's true, cigarettes are way worse. However, if I a choice of putting an untested chemical in my delicate lungs or not doing it, I would probably choose the second option.
@_date: 2017-09-25 14:33:28
But why would you even pay with bitcoin? The fees are too much for daily use.
@_date: 2017-10-02 07:22:50
Why would fucking bitcoin be useful in Puerto Rico right now? People there barely have power right now.
@_date: 2017-10-02 08:05:51
Ah, I see. Sorry
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:23:43
That is all true but it's generally not very welcoming to foreigners and the Japanese mentality might be a bit too much for westerners.
@_date: 2017-10-02 04:02:24
Good for you ;)
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:39:41
Japan is not the greatest place to live btw. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:18:53
Isn't this guy a complete lunatic?
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:38:47
It is. If you look closely you can even see the hard edges around the address.
@_date: 2017-07-22 08:08:30
Gambling your whole life is a good idea?
@_date: 2017-07-16 12:25:28
It's already lower.
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:42:24
He was drunk.
@_date: 2017-07-06 08:47:14
How can he even say that? There is no way to possibly predict it.
@_date: 2017-07-17 16:37:42
You didn't send him anything. That bitcoin address is photoshopped.
@_date: 2017-06-25 15:05:35
How do I keep the transaction size low?
@_date: 2017-06-25 12:13:59
How can I change the fee? My wallet only has 3 options - fast, average and slow, all are way too expensive (slow is still like $3.)
@_date: 2017-06-27 13:14:42
Well that's what I mean - for small transactions it's unusable. If bitcoin is actually meant to one day become a mainstream way of payment, that problem has to be fixed.
@_date: 2017-06-26 08:39:43
They shouldn't have held it in bitcoin then.
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:43:58
Bitcoin transaction fees make this whole system unusable. It's just too expensive.
@_date: 2017-06-26 17:17:09
And they should design a good-looking and usable interface.
@_date: 2017-06-27 11:49:09
Yeah, that makes it totally unusable, a least here in Poland, where $2.5 is a lot of money.
It's worth pointing out, though, that would never be able to buy a pizza for just $5. Most restaurants have a minimal order amount for delivery and that's usually around 50 PLN in Poland. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:43:01
Is that a good wallet to use? How is it different from something like Jaxx or Copay?
@_date: 2017-06-26 08:35:14
Satoshis per byte. A satoshi is one millionth of a bitcoin. Your transaction size is measured in bytes, and an average size is around 266 bytes. It can grow bigger depending on how many inputs you have.
