It's pretty great. I like both data visualizations. I think maybe adding another longer time frame like 30 days could also be interesting. 
The news is cool too, but it would be neat if you could filter by coins mentioned in the article (which would involve parsing the article for instances of coin names and tagging them, which seems doable.  
You might even scrape official Twitter accounts from coin market cap, tag that fees with a particular coin name, and include official tweets as a news source.

Does it matter? Do people know where currency comes from or how tap to pay credit cards work?

Starbucks saves money because Visa and MasterCard charge significant transaction fees. If they can make payments as easy as credit card, they'll earn more profit. That's where the incentive lies -- millions of dollars per year in credit card fees.

\&gt; **valuable for instant, global interactions**  
I think we're still a ways away from these instant interactions you speak of when it comes to BTC in particular. There a ton of things you can do with instant interactions that you can't do with 30 second interactions.

that's just silly. maybe if you're comparing $10,000 to $1,000,000, but $28 is too little to matter. children have $28 dollars. people spend $28 on a lunch.  No investor is devistated by the loss of $28.

I'm just talking about getting back to my original investment at this point (as a December investor who decided to throw a bunch more in Feb during a short-lived rally).

Honestly, I'd be happy with 10

it's not easy either (hardly anyone accepts it, high fees, slow confirmation)

XLM, it turns out, is also mostly owned by a single wallet.

On the other hand, if Bitcoin had a CEO he might have been able to shut down Ver a long time ago. BTC, in spite of price, has also performed incredibly poorly in terms of real world adoption, another area that could have fared fall better with some top\-down leadership.

Yes, and by a larger percentage than bitcoin, too. Congratulations!

I mean, I guess that's good for the Bakt investors but not actual present investors like us.
@_date: 2019-05-15 05:21:32
not even close. BTC is great as a store of value and not much else.

My first reaction is that this is a terrible idea (gambling with money that isn't yours) but I would support a modified version of your plan. Do what you planned but start saving money so that you can repay the 7k over a two year term. The hopefully you can leave your crypto investment locked in for as long as you want. And if it's not worth anything in a couple of years you're fine.
