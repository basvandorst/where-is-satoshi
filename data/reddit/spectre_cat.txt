Thanks! Yes that is exactly my interest, sure I'll look into it!

I am not demanding it, wth? I am just asking out of genuine interest...

Looks like Satoshi snacked a couple too many 50 BTC block rewards. The halvenings are his way to a healthy diet

I am shocked, absolutely shocked.

It is not really important but let's see if a nice symbol is liked, then it can be useful. There are things that are typically priced in sats.

OP you cheeky bastard

This was bound to happen after such a rise. But I doubt this upward momentum will stop so quickly

You simply cannot trust exchanges. They have been the cause of the biggest troubles since the beginning. Let's hope decentralised exchanges will grow in usage and maybe we'll have functional atomic swaps in the future if that is truly possible.

Congrats! Only a maximum of 21 million people will be able to have as much as you, in reality though a lot less because of lost coins.

Wow that interface is beautiful!

Insane, who would trade such massive positions?

I can already imagine the team meeting.
'So boys, how will we go about this dilemma, any suggestions?'  
'Well boss, we have been discussing this for a while and we all agree that it would be best if you would die. Not really though, just go to india and send back a death certificate.'  
'Ok sounds reasonable. Let's do this!'

Have you tried vanitygen? You will find results a lot faster, especially with oclvanitygen. I get 10MKey/s on a very old machine.
