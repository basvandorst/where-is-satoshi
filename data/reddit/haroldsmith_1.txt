It does not matter how many addresses you have unless you are interested in privacy. Have most of your Bitcoins in a cold wallet to prevent hacking.

Basics of a cold wallet:
1. Generate a bitcoin address with the 12 word passcode (some websites offer that option and remember to use HTTPS).
2. Do not let those 12 words ever be on your computer or electronic device.
3. Write down the 12 words on actual paper (no printing since that requires an electronic device). 
4. You can write those words on several papers and store it at home, lock box, and possibly bank deposit box.
5. It is recommended that you memorize those 12 words. 
6. Send all the Bitcoins you want in cold storage to that address.

You can't just brute force an address because addresses are on the public blockchain. People can brute force devices like computers which contain the private keys to access your address on the blockchain. You can use a hardware wallet which is not susceptible to hacks easily. It is recommended that you use a cold wallet besides a hardware wallet. Do more research if you want to know how it works.

Money is a medium of exchange. Only 5% of the wealth of the US is in currency the rest is in stocks, property, and other financial instruments. If everyone switched to Bitcoin then companies will pay stock owners, bond holders, and employees in Bitcoin instead of dollars. 
The Euro replaced all the currencies in many European nations around the beginning of the century and their society did not collapse. A change to a cryptocurrency that replaces fiat currencies will not happen overnight but will take time.
Recommendation of books relating to money, banking, and economics:
1. What has government done to our money - Murray Rothbard 
2. The creature from Jekyll Island - Edward Griffin 
3. The age of cryptocurrency
4. Digital Gold

Even if the government does not have access to your money, it can seize your stocks, homes, and property which constitute more than 99% of the wealth in America. While a cryptocurrency can guard against inflation by governments it will not eliminate taxes.

1 Bitcoin can be subdivided into 100 million units, referred to as a Satoshi. Moreover, if we need to subdivide 1 Bitcoin it into 1 billion units or 1 trillion units, the consensus can change to those units. The problem with gold and silver is that one unit cannot be subdivided into 100 million units when deflation occurs. Bitcoin has different properties that makes economic analogies from past currencies irrelevant.

After taking the USD off the gold standard, Nixon made a secret deal with Saudi Arabia in which they get security for only accepting USD for their oil. Soon, all OPEC countries were requiring USD for oil. That keeps the USD as a world reserve currency since each country will need to keep US dollars to buy oil.

That is possible if The Lightning Network is implemented.

You can probably have dedicated people solving the hashes. However, they must relay their solution to others in the network using...horses or telegraph lines?

Obviously, the computers can do the proof of work with out any need for outside communication. When the solution is found they can use shortwave radios to send the message to other computers. The entire Bitcoin network can run on shortwave radio communication.

Let’s say we didn’t have the internet. I came up with an even more ridiculous scheme which is the transmission of bitcoin transactions over shortwave, frequency-hopping, burst radio.
Today, I can get a kit that allows me to connect a very simplistic shortwave radio transmitter to my laptop via USB. Now all I need is an antenna. The nice thing about that is that with shortwave radio, an antenna consists of a sufficiently long piece of metal - a railway line, a clothesline, a broken-down electricity line, a fence line, a razor-wire fence.
Now, the transmission of a bitcoin transaction involves plugging in a laptop, attaching it to a fence post, pressing “enter,” and transmitting a burst transaction for 25 seconds. As long as there’s a receiving station somewhere within the surrounding thousand miles that is connected to the bitcoin network - and you can hide the receiving station anywhere you want, it’s a passive listener, it can’t be triangulated - that listening device can inject the transaction into the network.

This is ridiculous. Several Altcoins have privacy features like Monero and Zcash. Monero is untraceable while Zcash encrypts all the information on the Blockchain.
