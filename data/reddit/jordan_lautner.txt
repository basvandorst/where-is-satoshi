I got the dip, but there are better investments.
@_date: 2019-08-15 04:41:02
Help create the dip then buy back in @ 9000 - 8000 depending on your investing goals.

BTC predictions are just that, predictions. I'm not claiming prophecies, but these are just my rough REALISTIC guesses to illustrate bitcoins current "trend" although its all really fairy dust;
~$11k by end of 2019
~$16k by end of 2020
~$22k by end of 2021
~$40k by end of 2022
The reason is easily explained with only a simple understanding of economics. Essentially, people act in their own interest. New people become aware of bitcoin. If they also act in their own interest, then bitcoin will continue to gain value. This is an inevitable cycle because to break it requires people to "act out of their own personal interest". 
Obviously, this will take time &amp; patience, but its up to us to create the welcoming environment for new comers to join for ��  long term.
In the meantime i think everyone should be buying the "dips" &amp; accumulating as much BTC as possible.
The trend is upwards (long term), and nobody can stop it!

20% of my retirement fund is into bitcoin!

I still feel like coinbase is more secure though imo for USD to BTC transactions and holding my bank info.

Hey, i was playing the 250/500 table. 50k sato buy in. 
After winning the pot (14k sato) it only gave me 7k sato. So i had 57k sato after. I immediately stood from the table after.
Now i know a pot fee is normal on your end, but the higher tables your taking 50%!?

Get ready. ��

No keys = not your bitcoin, so they CAN stop your usage.... Temporarily anyways.... And control your assests to jerk you around on a possible emotional rollercoaster..... depending on your balance.....
Id never trust an app like Robinhood or CashApp with bitcoin.
Tbh, i use coinbase just to buy... we're all in the system one way or another anyways now-a-days...
Pay the ���� mob just so they leave you alone imo... Last thing you need is them taking it from you for "tax evasion"....
Taxes are still federal/state theft imo but...
As to where your bitcoin should sit for safety...
Paper wallet. ��
@_date: 2019-10-01 05:32:02
No keys. Thus you could face the same issue OP is having.

How do i find the hand ID? It was me and one other person at the table... Tf you mean "not as much equity in the pot as somebody else" ? 
Joined the table with 50k sato, played, pot was 14ksato, i won the hand, only had 57k sato after...
Thats a 50% rake, not 2.5%....

Start putting your $ into a credit union. Preferably a smaller one strictly in your state. Big banks are trying to stop $ going digital because we wont need them as much/ if at all eventually....
My credit union hasnt even asked a question on $10k dip buys.... 
That alone keeps me as a customer FOR LIFE (or until USD is obsolete). ��������

Internet money will take over, just like when facebook started taking over myspace. 
I think the same transferring transition situation will happen, only with actual VALUE chosen by THE PEOPLE not AN EVIL GOVERNMENT that can just print money whenever it wants to... 21million btc and thats it... No more, ever.....
To also help out this "transition", i offer my local friends who pay in bitcoin $1 off per gram. So they are forced to get into bitcoin, or just not get a great deal. Lol
@_date: 2019-12-24 07:32:02
Lol. Wtf? Brah, share w/e tf you smokin.....
But Go beg somewhere else. ��

Save yourself the hard work and emotional rollercoaster.
Just buy bitcoin and transfer it directly to your hardwallet so someone else has to pay for the electric and time to produce $× amount of bitcoin you buy as you just sit back, relax and watch the waves.������������ ��✌

The USD used to buy virtual (non existent) crypto coins was already taxed state and federally. Therfore the IRS isnt entitled to a penny of tax on any of my virtual (non existent) crypto balances.

Great general assumption. But that was last night after i left work.
Dont i get 10k sato for you being wrong?

I think DCEP stands for DECEPTION imo since China has manipulated their currency before lol, but, the move to a digital currency on a national lvl proves that bitcoin and other major coins are  actually MONEY, not just an asset like a car or house as the IRS has them currently classified.
As to why china just didnt use Bitcoin, no idea, but the proof is in the pudding...
I dont think we'll go back to the gold standard.
Imo, DCEP is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-12-24 23:15:54
Yeah, a bitpay card solves all that you mention imo.
Just send funds to bitpay card an hour before spending.
The real issue is going to work and getting paid with fiat. Being FORCED into using fiat. Fiat to bitcoin can easily be made inaccessible for most.

25% of Frosted Fruit profits will get converted right into bitcoin. �� 
Nothing like growing recreational weed &amp; turning it into more profit...
��How to build wealth in 2020⏬
1: Learn a high income skill (growing cannabis for me)
2: Use it to start a scaleable business (recreational storefront)
3: Invest 10-30% of business profits (bitcoin / other crypto)
