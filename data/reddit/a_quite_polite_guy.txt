All right!
**First: you'll need a miner.** 
On Windows I (and many) prefer [GUIminer]( That is a GUI that comes bundled with some miners, and is very easy to use. 
On Mac I use [DiabloMiner]( 
On Linux I use [pocbm]( (You'll probably need to get additional drivers for you graphics card to support OpenCL)
Downloaded the one you need? Nice!
**Then we'll get a mining pool!**
It is easiest to use Eligius. It requires no registration (this means you'll be anonymous, if you think that is important) and no setup, and takes no % of your money! 
Start up your miner of choose, and configure it like this: 
**Server**: mining.eligius.st
**Port**: 8337
**Username**: Your bitcoin adress (looks like this: 1F6uienF7TBpfZQtEKKgerLumsjybJEtKz but replace with your own)
**Password**: x
This should be all you need to know to get started. 
Good luck, if you need any more help reply here or mail tynail 
Also, if this was help, I am tipable at 1F6uienF7TBpfZQtEKKgerLumsjybJEtKz ;)

I am not absolutely sure (since I'm not on windows) but I do believe there is one "Other" in that list. Select it and you'll be able to manually type what server you want to connect to. 
The bitcoin adress: Depends on what wallet you have. I use Satoshis original one (*the* wallet) and in that I hit "Receive coins", "New address" and name that address "Mining" or something like that. Then is select the address I want to use, click "Copy to Clipboard" and then paste it in my miner. 
If you want your money to go directly to MtGox you can find that address in "deposit funds" on their website, I believe. 
Did you find it?

I have ~40 m/hash and my miner runs when I'm at work or out with friends on weekend nights. I get about 0.02 btc/day, so it's not more than novelty money. So you'll get 0.05/day if I should guess, but really I've got no clue. 
Have it run for a couple of days and then you'll know.
