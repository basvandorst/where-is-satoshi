I risked less than that on a 3500 sq ft home. I could have even taken cash with me from the closing if I had wanted to.
The only cash I had to come up with was advance property taxes and insurance for escrow (which was returned to me with interest 1yr later), and some misc closing related costs (but not the whole amount).
I had decent, but not great credit, less than 10k in checking, and income, that's it. It was a USDA loan &amp; did the first time home buyer's thing, whatever that is.

Thanks for the explanation. That won't be necessary, my comment was intended as sarcasm and in any case as the length of your reply illustrates, the problem(s) cannot be reasonably summed up in a single sentence.
I would remark though that while the law may intend to protect stakeholders and may even manage to do so most of the time, that there isn't any way to prevent a determined effort to strip a company of its assets and leave the [PBGF]( and/or others holding the bag.

4% - 5% interest and depressed housing prices? You're a fool not to buy one. Hell, buy a dozen. I would if I could. Interest rates are roughly on par with inflation, making the net borrowing cost close to zero.
As for not having a lot of liquid assets:
1. Who does, these days? (bitcoin millionaires notwithstanding)
1. Better to risk a bank's money than your own.

re: (2) This is by design. We don't want professional scammers to learn, and thus be able to game, our system.
Scammers can still pen-test your system because scammers' accounts are disposable. They can A/B test you all day and all night with different transactions and circumstances. If you ban one, or refuse a transaction, then they learned something. It might take them a while to learn everything they need to know, but it certainly won't take them anywhere near two years of methodically buying BTC one at a time. If a long-time customer's account is suspected of actually scamming you in this way, the account is probably stolen/hacked.

I bought an older house. I've had a few large repair expenses. For most of these things, financing can be arranged. My plumber for example, offers financing through some company. None of my repair bills yet have been so big that I needed to finance one, but I can if I need to. I may have to replace my aged A/C system soon. I'm not worried about that one, even though I will probably want to finance it, may even need to. The system to be replaced is old enough that the energy a new system will save is worth far more than the interest I would pay on a loan, probably even if I put it on a credit card.

It looks to me like if you want to buy a pizza now, and since you're hungry you want to be sure that the txn goes right away, you'll need to pay 390 Satoshi per byte. Assuming around 250-500 bytes for that txn puts the cost for the txn at a few USD. That does seem a bit steep.

A couple of questions. Millions per day/week/month/year? So, one armored car daily/weekly for a large retail store? A few times per week? 
raises a good point, but it doesn't answer the question of just how much energy is expended moving physical currency around. It could still be quite a bit of energy compared to Bitcoin or some alternative. And then we still haven't counted the other expenses of running the computers that keep the bank USD ledgers, &amp; etc.
