solex1 means in the money-supply sense, i.e. more 25 bitcoins are created every 10 minutes or so. I assume this works out to an 11% annual increase in the total # of bitcoins.

There was a huge sell wall of over 5000 BTC at 266.90, and people started buying into it gradually. If no one sells lower in between buys - that is, if consecutive transactions all occur at the same price - the buys just add up (as far as bitcoinity is concerned). So it's not necessarily all the same buyer. I think I recall a number of purchases on the order of 100-500's (maybe one 1000 or so) that added up to that 2014.26, and that lasted over the three minutes shown since the previous transaction price.
Edit: To clarify that the adding up of consecutive buys at the same price is just the way bitcoinity decides to display it.

For the lazy:


Calculate the number of blocks per 4 year cycle:
6 blocks per hour
* 24 hours per day
* 365 days per year
* 4 years per cycle
= 210,240
~= 210,000
Sum all the block reward sizes:
50 + 25 + 12.5 + 6.25 + 3.125 + ... = 100
Multiply the two:
210,000 * 100 = 21 million.
Economically, because the currency is effectively infinitely divisible, then the precise amount doesn't matter, as long as the limit remains fixed.

You are suggesting that enough miners will drop out to lower the difficulty enough to make a 51% attack feasible. I think this is unlikely but anyway, assuming it's true, I don't think re-mining will solve this issue indefinitely. Especially given that over time people will be less and less likely to lose their coins (as technology/ease of use/value of coins increases). 
Paying miners via inflation (increasing the limit above 21 million) could solve it though, but note that this will destroy one of the main advantages bitcoin has over other currencies.


OK, but who's going to make this judgement? A central authority? If the value of bitcoin has not stabilized by that point, will this re-mining reward need to be constantly re-adjusted?


By the time the coins are declared lost (after xxx years), the market will have already adjusted to account for lower supply. Reintroducing that supply will upset the money supply / market, not stabilize it.

@_date: 2013-11-26 03:30:24
One of the great things about a decentralized cryptocurrenciy like Bitcoin is that the problems being solved to mine the coins are based on the previous blocks in the blockchain via a simple computer algorithm, so that you can't get a head start on mining block n+1 before block n has been solved. For your human-only problems you need to have all the nodes on your network be able to automatically generate each problem based on plugging the solution of the previous problem into a simple algorithm. How are you going to do that with these human-only problems?
You can get around that by making your currency issued by a central authority, but good luck getting anyone to buy it in that case.

This would also be accomplished by declaring those coins dead and irretrievable.


Mining is not lacking for funding. Is there something wrong with the current block-reward setup, because to my eyes it's been pretty successful. The more consistent the block rewards, the better off the industry is.


To use an extreme example, how does "all of a sudden after 50 years of inactivity, Satoshi's deleted 1 million bitcoins comes on the market, now worth 5% of the world's total liquid assets" imply a stable money supply? Wouldn't it be more stable if they were just declared dead?

From 
"The difficulty is adjusted every 2016 blocks based on the time it took to find the previous 2016 blocks."
Who determines the amount of time it took to find the previous 2016 blocks? The only thing I can imagine is that each miner makes this calculation independently based on its own clock. Otherwise is there some centralized time server that's used? If the miners do this calculation independently, can they all collude by rigging their clocks to make the difficulty drop?

Mostly relevant on long time scales, for example the 2-year chart. The price increase "looks" more linear on a log chart - it's easier to see the pattern, since you can practically draw a straight line through it, unlike with a linear scale, where the price increase looks like a horizontal line followed by a vertical line - it's hard to tell anything from that.

I was being a bit deliberately vague to see what people would come up with. One thing is, it could be another motto, just like "the honey badger of money". (The reference is obviously to the Gettysberg Address.)
Another thing is, I agree "that's the idea", but to what extent do we know it's true? We'd like to think Satoshi is "one of us", but he may not be. But it may not matter, if the miners are "of the people" anyway. I guess I'm just putting this out there as a meme to see if it catches on.
@_date: 2013-11-13 06:31:04
1. Part of what made the price go up was him selling part of his stash and the subsequent headlines that generated. So, if he could have predicted the price rise and held instead of selling, the price rise may not have happened to the extent that it did. "Man discovers X bitcoins and holds!" isn't as eye-catching as "Man discovers X bitcoins and buys apartment!" He may even have been worse off!
2. I think you mean granted, not granite. :P

There had been a few DDOS attacks on mtgox exchange in the days/weeks leading up to that. This time, they simply couldn't handle the rapid increase in transaction volume from all the increased interest with the price rise. Their trading engine started getting delayed, they went offline for some hours, and then everybody panicked and sold. Have since fixed the problem, apparently.
Also, at that time, mtgox was doing over 50% bitcoin volume. Now it's like 20%. The exchanges are far more distributed.

One thing to keep in mind, is that it doesn't have to actually move. Just the threat that it might be possible to do so (in the future), would keep expectations for the price at similar level (after currency conversion). At least in theory.

This. I can totally imagine someone saying to himself: "Look how thin and fragile that Chinese buy support looks. If I can spook them, they'll probably drop 15%." So, he sells a whole bunch, maybe 500-1000 to freak everyone out, everyone panic sells, China drops through the floor, everyone else panics some more, and then he buys back at the bottom.
No proof for this, just a theory, but it seems like it wouldn't be hard to execute.

Two points to clarify my initial post:
I wasn't suggesting changing any protocol or wallet software or making this a *necessary* step. Just something that people could do (look up the address on blockchain.info, which takes seconds) manually if they wanted, for safety and peace of mind. So I wouldn't call this centralization.
Also, the concern is not random address collision, which I agree has a 0% chance of happening, but rather, bugs in the address generation software/hardware due to a problem of the random number generator which mean that the addresses produced are not actually random. This actually happened recently:
so the probability was demonstrably non-zero.
