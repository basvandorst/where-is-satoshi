Why not do it yourself? Generate a bunch of new addresses and shuffle the money through them?

I can help you get it set up on your site, and help with converting into USD if you are interested. 
@_date: 2012-08-20 19:01:24
Yea, it's falling until mid week, and then it'll come back up.  I'll give you $8.50/coin if your still looking to sell
@_date: 2012-08-20 18:47:47
Why did you do that?
@_date: 2012-07-20 00:44:36
Is there a way I could buy the money from you and send you a money order or something? I want to buy some BC

I think DDoS attacks themselves are just becoming more common, and with that theres a lot of forward movement in defense.  These attacks are just a speed bump.

Can someone make a site that people can click buying or selling, and we can see what most people are doing now?

@_date: 2013-05-30 18:37:44

BTC Guild was under a DDoS attack over the past few days, 0 hash was coming out yesterday, maybe thats it?
@_date: 2013-04-06 18:17:47

I bought at .0005 and I just bought more at .002, I think it's a wicked deal, once the wall is gone, the price will jump even more
@_date: 2013-05-30 19:18:44
Whats the catch? Sounds too good to be true...

Im thinking about writing a weekly article or something.  I spend way too much time on BTCTalk and I watch the exchanges religiously. Im a small timer, But id love to share my predictions and get feedback on what Im doing. Do you think I could just post it in this subreddit?

Their FAQs say:
I WITHDREW TO THE WRONG ADDRESS PLEASE HELP!
There is absolutely nothing we can do, if this transaction shows up in your Transaction history as being sent, this means we sent the Bitcoins and have the publicly viewable transaction id to prove it. Bitcoin transactions are NOT REVERSIBLE, be extra careful when withdrawing and be sure it is to a Bitcoin address that you own or trust!
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:58:33
Are there more? Or just the one?
@_date: 2013-04-16 00:43:48
Awesome, I look forward to it :)
@_date: 2013-04-25 07:35:11
Personally I've seen the price drops over the weekend. Thats just my opinion though
