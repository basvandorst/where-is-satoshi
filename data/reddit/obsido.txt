I've been waiting since early July for this to be confirmed, but the problem is that we lost the upwards going trend some time back, we are currently under the support level(9750) we needed to hold for bitcoin to show strength for a potential reversal in case golden cross does happen and it's currently not showing strength even though it double bottomed at \~9.1k. Sure we pumped from 9.1k to 9.7k, but sadly bounced the support to hold. We should come back up and test 10.6k, but I'm not very hopeful at the moment. Maybe after hitting even stronger support further down.

I like how nobody gives a shit if bitcoin pumps \~$700, but if it drops the same amount people becomes shocked and screams that the market is manipulated. It tanked because we failed to gain new highs, hopefully we will go up again and re-test the 12k area or we will go down below 11k again.

They are not liberals, they are far-left. Liberals are normal people that doesn't rage as soon as they see a person that is not left leaning speak about anything. Liberals won't shut out words from someone simply because they are conservatives for example. I know it's a the new norm to call them all liberals, but it's not true and if they call themselves liberals then that makes them uninformed.

That's the truth though, look at the way you reacted just now. I didn't even mention I liked Shapiro and the first thing you wrote was to try and tie me with him. I'm not a fan of Shapiro, I never have been and never will be.

No I wouldn't say so, what's your point?
@_date: 2019-08-03 16:41:48
Wow, you just keep proving my point. Go outside and relax, you seem angry.

Yeah, I remember seeing this guy "announcing" that he's officially done with crypto and that he's not coming back. I guess he's back and more angry than ever.
Looking at his past charts it's pretty obvious why he failed, all he did was basically to trade trends and when you don't take anything else into account then trading trends is pretty stupid.

I read that on Buzzfeed aswell, everything that is not the most popular controlled social media platform is a platform for white supremacists, space nazis and white robots.

Nah that doesn't make sense, I think he lost it all (or sold it all too early and is too ashamed to say it) and wanted to buy back in now but missed the opportunity because he hoped it would go below 3k, that's why he's so butthurt about even talking about bitcoin.
If he was already in such a great position he would shill the living hell out of bitcoin, I don't think he would want to make it go down again over a 1 year period or something like that. Time is money and he's getting old.

Yup, which is why the BTC dominance being "this and that" is complete garbage.
