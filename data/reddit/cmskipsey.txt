There are only 2 things I can't stand in this world: People who are intolerant of other peoples cultures and the Dutch.

Yes, but like me you probably told them to buy in 2015 and 2016.  No one listened until Jan 2018, and they pissed they got no lambo yet... FFS

I really should fix my reddit settings - I didn't realise people had responded!  So I get the feeling that Bitcoin is (potentially) much more accurate system of recording value exchange than fiat currency?

Agree. And you don't have to spend big chunks of it either - top up or pay your mobile phone (bitrefill), buy a VPN (ipvanish) service, get a coffee (find a coffee shop that takes it, most cities have at least one) etc. Lots of these little purchases will help. Sure, that $5 coffee might be $500 in a few years, but if you've still held 70-80% of your stack, you're not going to care that much.

It's more a question of who manipulates the market and can the gov control / influence them. My guess is that the CME/CBOE are so squarely up the SEC ass that it might be hard for them to eject "the big one".

I've used the "money is a spreadsheet" speel for newbies many times. Each note or coin is simply a cell in a gigantic spreadsheet. Works for people who use spreadsheets at least lol

I don't get it.  Russia is supposed to be all about liberty.  They constantly accuse the US of being draconian and orchestrating an unsustainable global political ecosystem. 
Yet they push for laws that don't allow their own people to choose how they trade value.  Seems hypocritical to me...

Agree, I see both ETH and BTC co-existing for different reasons / features.  But you say BTC is UNLIMITED and ETH is LIMITED... I thought BTC has a 21m limit?

Perhaps it's time for truly decentralised exchanges...

Thanks for the responses folks, this actually my first r/bitcoin thread post (I'm a "long time listener, first time caller" kind of guy :).  Didn't expect to be trolled so quickly...  reddit is fun!
@_date: 2017-01-22 00:06:53
Agree. Most people will be happy to let the banks keep their keys, for the insurance, peace of mind etc  Everyone else will have hardware wallets, which is kinda like a modern day version of putting cash under your mattress (minus the government driven systemic devaluation of course!) 
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:51:37
Bitsquare seems to have a way to do fiat, I think you just transfer money into the bank account of the person your buying the crypto off.
@_date: 2017-01-07 17:54:01
Why couldn't a decentralised exchange have adequate liquidity - isn't it just a function of how many trades are processed?  And if it's truly decentralised, there's no holding account on the middle needed to float heavy trading days - just pure p2p trading...

The first sign of recognition seems to be these activities of banning / making illegal.  It's a signal of progress, in a way.

I had my Commonwealth Bank accounts frozen when I was in Vietnam.  Well technically they said they needed a fax (yes, a fax) to verify my identity!  I threatened to go to the ombudsman, all the problems magically disappeared.  Was it related to Bitcoin? - probably not, I think it was a coincidence as I found many other folks ran into similar problems with this bank.
But I did find it odd that they refused to tell me why this all happened, even when they fixed it they wouldn't explain.  Said it "would expose their security practices" if they did explain.
Give the benefit of the doubt, banks have some antiquated policies (KYC/AML etc) based on what the world was before modern technology, let alone Bitcoin.

Governments are eradicating cash and robbing the middle class of savings to bail out of debt.  It's an experiment and the people are the subjects.  Bitcoin is providing an exit from these experiments.
@_date: 2016-12-24 23:01:12
I think you're right, it's a slow burn.  I've just noticed a few of my friends and family beginning to do research into BTC, buying small amounts and watching the space.  Others may have observed the same.  For sure, it's not mainstream yet, but BTC is certainly not as alien now as it was to the average punter 2 years ago.
@_date: 2018-06-21 13:48:21
Agree. The end game is there is no cash. At some point it'll begin making more sense to measure your crypto portfolio in BTC rather than fiat.

Thanks mate! As others have said the data, on the face of it, is valid. However there's no real way to prove fake (or real) trades. That's more than enough ambiguity for Bitwise to capitalize on - rather clever of them. 
@_date: 2019-04-03 13:44:27
It's possibly a play by Bitwise to get their EFT approval over others. Paint a picture of how theirs is different in the eyes of the SEC / CTFC.

I agree, I don't think Gavin is doing underhanded shit.  And he continues to hold his head high despite the tsunami of shit getting thrown at him on a daily basis, and he should be commended for that.  However, peoples behavior is predominantly influenced by their situational factors, not their disposition as we often think (the Fundamental Attribution Error). 
So, is it possible that the powers that be could influence Gavin's behavior?  Yes, with either reward (offering money - everyone has a price) or punishment (threats of harm) - I don't have evidence if either of these occurring.  But I'd be silly to think central banks / govt wasn't capable of these things.
