I just saw my favorite ever Keiser Report interview, thank you Amir!
Although it escapes me how and who got him to wear a jacket!

I'm proud of you.

You'd love that thing called multisignature bitcoin address.

While that may be true, his point gets through this way too and i just love him the exact way he is. His content/meaning is so strong that the way of performance becomes insignificant.

This is all weary. How about trying to help him/his family? I hope it doesn't count as doxing, but i found his girlfriend on facebook.
Please be courteous if you contact.

The photo is from Ankert. You can pay with bitcoin both at Anker Klub (next to Deák Ferenc tér, they also have a bitcoin ATM) and at Ankert (bit further into the smaller streets). HQ Café (not far from the previous two) also accepts it.

1. What were you thinking? It's one of the most obviously gov-pandering "exchanges". Circle, BitStamp, et al. won't do better, KYC all the way. Thse are fully centralized structures. Buy in person (THE best experience ever), from a bitcoin ATM that requires no ID, through forum communities, via LocalBitcoins or Mycelium Local Trader.
2. Use real wallets. This is important. Ones where you actually own the private key, and only YOU own it. Electrum. Armory. Multibit. Bitcoin Core. Plethora of others on mobile platforms. 
3. A decent DNM should use (offer) a different deposit address for each transaction. If this one did, that means the DNM cooperated with Coinbase; or (less probably) your traffic is very finely surveiled and/or decrypted, or your OS has a huge backdoor in it.

You are wrong. The system and its inner mechanism is very well described as "honest", this is the most transparent, fraud-proof monetary system up to this point in our known history. If by your words you mean the Goxes, the scamcoins, the frakked up Foundations – that has nothing to do with the honesty of the system. That is the people (more precisely, *some* of the people) using the system.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:48:06
But why on earth would the alleged hacker use ONE SINGLE ADDRESS for this? Other than if their single purpose is to damage Bitcoin's reputation?
@_date: 2015-01-30 18:36:08
Dude... right, I don't doubt you work for a large bank. But a main principle of Bitcoin is: "kill the middlemen". Where are those safe deposit boxes and who has keys to them? You see.
"Banks are not allowed to..." really means naivety. It's not about what is *allowed* (by some words written on paper), but about what is *possible*.
Those specialist can get in. Those who have copies of the key can get in. Those who manufactured the boxes can get in. And the box is directly associated with your identity in a database which some anons hack and publicize just for fun.
Your paper backup can be taken from the safe deposit box by authorities with government warrant in no time. On the contrary, taking away something that is not known to exist or its location can't be known is quite difficult.

I don't know... s/he went with one withdrawal at a time (probably wanted to stay under the radar for as long as possible), with at least 1-2 blocks between each. ~10 minutes are more than enough to make a new address and copy it to the clipboard.

As others said, I would be more confident if it used (or had the option to use) a browser extension for the user-end encryption. And what about the part "Tell us a bit about yourself" at the registration...?
@_date: 2015-01-30 18:15:47
Splitting up keys work well in some scenarios; thought not all. The final answer will always be... individual responsibility.
I think this "what happens with my coins when I die" issue can be solved with a well though-out multisig fund where you share keys with those you love and trust the most and set the n-of-m requirement according to your life situation and the participants. Though I wouldn't keep all my coins this way, only those that are really long-term savings.
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:17:51


No, no, don't put it into a property searchable by banks or authorities. Store it at a place that either only you can access or only you know such a thing could be kept there. Sit down and get creative; believe me, it's worth your financial freedom.
@_date: 2015-01-05 23:34:38
Seek out someone in your area on LocalBitcoins.com with good reputation and meet face to face. Easiest thing and has a nice social quality.
@_date: 2015-01-10 14:40:45
I see no practical upside of multisig addresses as long as all n number of keys are held by BitStamp. I just checked it out and you can't insert your part (a public key of yours) to create a new multisig address.
This may make an attacker's job a bit harder but the security is still not distributed between the user and the exchange.

Your solution sounds loads better. What name shall I be looking out for in the future?
@_date: 2015-01-16 12:37:18
Read the tech info. This is absolutely promising and I am looking forward to it. Thank you for all your efforts!
@_date: 2015-01-26 13:07:58
Note sure about the technical requirements, but check out Bits Of Proof's BOPshop and BitPay's Bitcore.

Do you have an idea about what spirit lead the creator of Bitcoin?
Have you never read the coinbase of the first ever block on the network?
Please do: 
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:00:45
Only one way to find out.
@_date: 2015-07-06 14:49:00
I believe validating a block takes so little time that it's impossible to find a new block earlier. If my thinking is correct, it's the time they download the (currently) max. 1 MB block and then doing a hash on that. They have 10 minutes on average, even 1 minute should be enough to download 1 MB and hash it once.
@_date: 2015-07-06 16:45:39
Oh, i see. Thanks for pointing out!

Tying real-life identities to transactions, that's what it's all about.
Let's use one of the most anarchistic tools to pay taxes to the State! How innovative! Cheer, vote, call your senators, yay!
And if you think it's good because it'd make gov finance transparent, don't think even for a moment that they will hold the coins. Plus, you are still cheering for some weird strangers to control the fate of your lives.

Sending a private key via e-mail is a really bad idea! Don't do it. Rather send her basic instructions on how to set up a thin wallet and ask for an address.
