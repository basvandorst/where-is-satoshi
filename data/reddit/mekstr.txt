I'm starting to think TA is a religion.

You talk like you know things but the pic says $4 (for the first km) just like any other cabs running.
Crooks? You must be mistaking with some other country.
Is that expensive for you to advise people not to take one? It of course gets pricey if you ride a good distance but you'll have cheaper trains instead of doing that.

It is...

At least the price had recovered to the point people started to joke again. (Albeit same old one.)

What if it's better than US controlling the worldwide monetary system?

I imagine that Bitcoin is now an asset to hedge against fiat but with that said, it only looks like a temporary recovery against Trump's tariff tweet when previously, the buying power has been thinning for weeks now and if all that can do is bump $1000, it could go down when the trade deal becomes better.

There are many who got uninterested about cryptocurrency when the price dived and never checked back but when hitting $10k (unlike $9k for Reddit) , the media will go frenzy about the price coming back, creating mass exposure to those who would feel for FOMO.

It's possible people stacked up around $9k and media will definitely report en masse when it hits $10k to get newbies' attentions.

At least it makes a precedence that such a move isn't impossible.

Why do they have to end? They're thinking about accepting crypto deposits. Lending money is a service that will not end just because the underlying asset type gets swapped out.

I do not remember a single time the price went up after this was posted.

More like afraid to see this sub filled with Dragon Ball 9000 meme all over when it touches 9000.

Didn't know cryptocurrency is hack proof. /s

Are you saying, your account is Tim Draper's alt?

Is that a BitBall I heard about that lets me buy anything I want?

What could be the cause?
I take it the last pump was made by average non tech joes who figured it could be profitable. Who else is left to do more without ETF?
Though I admit I let my 'average' mom buy some during the bear period.
If those average joe's dads are going to enter, that's big but do they put money on unregulated volatile assets?

Not everyone is crypto nerd out there.
Many companies can't just report their income in crypto and they don't want to maintain a wallet or train accounting to liquidate it.

Why don't you talk about more recent Venezuela crisis?

Isn't futures only introducing more shorters?
