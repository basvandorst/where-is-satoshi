Well yeah, in this market. But if there's one thing we've learned about the bitcoin market, it's that it changes very quickly.

start a mass adoption campaign - BTC detroit - try to get as many local businesses to accept it as possible. create a place where entrepreneurs can brainstorm small business using btc. BTC delivery. Organize a farmers market w/ btc initiative. Put up a bulletin board for people advertising BTC-based services in town. Organize BTC fundraisers and giveaways. Map out the city and try to put enough ATMs so that people can always buy more. Close the loop!

I am really starting to think this is a good idea.

Guess I was right

I can't really imagine btc ever becoming 0. Say you put in $100 worth of btc and convert it to $100 USD. Then tomorrow bitcoin's price becomes 0.001. Well, now you can withdraw immediately for $100 with of bitcoins which is... 100,000 btc?
Then you're free to sell your 100,000 BTC

Right, I was kind of thinking that. I'd much rather have my money in a bank that doesn't use fractional reserve banking (DUH!) I think this is a huge feature. "Hey guys, we're one of the only banks that's not going to loan out your money to make us money."
Really then the question is, how will they make money? Currency conversion? I guess there's some profit to be had there.

God, if only I had been paid in bitcoin last year.
I'd be a rich IT worker!

Was expecting a perfect sinusoid as well. Disappointed.

I haven't been this excited about a bitcoin app in some time.
Is this bullish in the long term for bitcoin prices?

Lol, Cryptsy was actually hiring PHP developers in my area of florida. I considered applying. It would have been hilarious to work for a scammy exchange.
Edit: No. 1 hint that a tech company sucks: They're based in Florida. (Source: I'm from Florida)

Time to buy.

Would you say the same for a price between $10-$40? Because I think the true value lies somewhere in there.
@_date: 2013-12-25 14:21:33
I thought I was the only one.

Drinking is how i learned about btc

Too bad you can't just order an entire cold wallet - private key and all. I mean, the manufacturer would know the private key, so what's the point?

I just successfully withdrew .7 btc. Thanks for scaring me, OP!
