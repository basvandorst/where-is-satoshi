dammt, it was from a rather bit trading website, am i going to have to wait for the entire backlog to clear?

What an asshole comment to make. I was just having a little fun asking about what is theoretically possible. No shit nobody knows what bitcoin will do. Its fun to talk about it.
It seems to be you are the annoying prick! The whole point of what i asked is to pull some numbers out of our asses. Doesn't everyone with a few coins want to get rich?

Thank you! Just read about this bot a little while ago and figured out how to cash in my (little) karma. Together with this I am putting it in my new wallet, and will then transfer some back to my bottip accout. perfect way to test transfers back and fourth. you rock!

300 per mBTC is 300k per BTC correct? that would be awesome.
