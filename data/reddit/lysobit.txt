You're using Shopify which [comes built in with BitPay integration]( so accepting it should be easy.
BitPay shields you from the price volatility of Bitcoin by offering to immediately [exchange received Bitcoins into GBP]( so the risk would be none in that regard. If you don't want to, you never need to hold or touch any Bitcoins when accepting payments.

Mind you, GHash.IO has already been [caught red-handed doing double spend attacks]( last year. It was supposedly blamed on a "rogue employee".
@_date: 2014-06-18 11:18:21
The extent to which they push "located in Switzerland, therefore we're untouchable" is a major red flag and makes me feel uncomfortable. Surely they cannot be this naive?
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:37:15
"Let's assume GHash.IO have 1 million bitcoins and can doublespend."
1. Buy a lot of really expensive items for those 1 million Bitcoins.
2. Do a double spend attack so that they keep those 1 million Bitcoins for themselves, that they're supposed to have spent.
3. Now they have 2 million Bitcoins worth of assets.
4. Those just stole 1 million Bitcoins worth of items and severely reduced trust in Bitcoin. How many people do you think are going to keep their trust in Bitcoin?

It doesn't matter if you catch them. By the time you catch them, they've already double spent the coins. At that point "6 confirmations" isn't a good enough check because with 51% of the network power you're statistically reasonably likely to create more than 6 blocks in a row.
See [GHash.IO and double-spending against BetCoin Dice](
I really don't see how the 51% attack problem can be shrugged off as not a big deal by saying "ye, well if they misbehave and abuse their trust we'll catch them". Bitcoin is designed as a trustless system.

Ditto. This is what I meant.

I'm not sure how "cannot suffer the same fate as Lavabit" can be derived from "not based in the US". To do so would require the false assumption that every country except the US has no legal procedures against providers who provide encrypted services.
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:32:35
If the cryptography works and is truly end-to-end, "located in Switzerland" should not be an advantage nor a disadvantage. At the end of the day, I should not have to trust the ProtonMail servers if the encryption happens on my end, much like in Bitcoin the protocol is trustless and I don't have to trust anyone with my private key, so the location of the ProtonMail servers is irrelevant.
Cryptography should not be based on legal, political or human promises, but on mathematical proof.
Besides, ProtonMail advertises end-to-end browser encryption, so the private keys are generated client-side, so in theory no one can force them to hand over encryption keys as they shouldn't have any - so why even use location as a marketing point?
Even if the US can force them to dump encrypted data if they were US-based, if the cryptography is sound then the encrypted data should be entirely useless and random data.

To do a double spend &gt;51% attack, you only need to get 2 machines to accept your desired next block. The machines that run GHash.IO and BTC Guild's full Bitcoin nodes which listen for transactions. Hardly 51% of the network.
@_date: 2014-06-10 21:31:44
You don't have to be the owner of GHash.IO to abuse it.
* A government, bank or cartel could force them to do it.
* A government, bank or cartel could pay them to do it.
* A hacker who compromises their servers could do it.
Mind you, GHash.IO has already been [caught doing double spend attacks]( last year. So yes, they *have* already done it. In that case, they blamed it on a rogue employee which they've since supposedly fired.

I don't think you understand how a 51% attack works. A 51% attack does not allow you to spend other people's coins; you can't do that without their private key.


Again, you're guessing what their motives might be, which is naive. You're justifying exploiting a flaw in Bitcoin by saying "ye, well, not that many people are effected if someone does exploit it anyways" and giving a non-severe example, and implying that there cannot be an scenario with wide-reaching consequences.
You can do a lot more than "buy some fucking coffee using merchants that delivery coffee instantly with no verifications".
If you own a large portion of the network hashing power, you can do a double spend attack even against merchants that wait for 6 confirmations, because you are statistically reasonably likely to generate 6 blocks in a row. In that kind of scenario, you can steal a lot more than "$5000".
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:22:37
Let's suppose that the owners of GHash.IO and BTC Guild decided to secretly co-operate. They can now control the network and conspire on double spend attacks and no one would be the wiser, and hence would not hurt their own interests as long as the secret was kept.
Even if the owners of GHash.IO and BTC Guild didn't conspire, someone can still do the same thing by either a) forcing them to mine their desired blocks, and keep quiet about it or b) compromise the Bitcoin nodes of those two pools and inject their own desired blocks.
@_date: 2014-06-10 22:48:56
Yes. And in the case of a rogue employee, *did*.
@_date: 2014-01-09 17:41:24


What if their purpose is to destroy Bitcoin?
Are you actually trusting that anyone who will reach 51% of the network's hashing power wants to do what is in the best interest of Bitcoin, and wants Bitcoin to be as valuable as possible?
Your threat model is flawed, and seems to be guessing what an attacker's motive might be.

Stay away when you see crypto apps advertise "located in Switzerland" as a marketing point. If the crypto works, the location is irrelevant.

Because P2Pools are decentralised, so there isn't a pool operator to dictate which blocks should be mined even if a P2Pool reaches 51% of the network's hashing power.
Large centralized pools are not healthy for a decentralized network.
@_date: 2014-01-09 15:05:02
The Bitcoin network, maybe. The protocol itself? No.
The hivemind just needs adopt to self-regulate a democratic, free market. Quite a contrast to typical markets, which are government-regulated. People are still new to the new paradigm.
@_date: 2014-06-17 18:17:42
Given that P2Pool only recently reached 1PHs recently, doesn't adding this mining node with 1PHs mean that the node will possibly have 51% of the hashrate on P2Pool? Remember, P2Pool itself is also susceptible to the 51% attack.
@_date: 2014-06-08 14:04:31
Because with the current proof-of-work, there's no way to prove that a block wasn't mined by an entity that have other people with mining rigs mining on behalf of it. Pools operate independently of the Bitcoin protocol; they use their own protocols to give mining tasks to its miners.
You'd need to invent a new proof-of-work such that the work cannot be split up into smaller proof-of-works that are given to miners in a pool.

Where exactly in the source code are you reading?
A quick search of the source code shows 0 instances of [Math.random]( and that [it actually uses Crypto.util.randomBytes()]( from the [Crypto.js library]( which is intended to be a cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator.
@_date: 2014-01-09 18:01:13


Why not exactly? The Bitcoin protocol allows you to spend as many Bitcoins as you want in one transaction. Even so, there are Bitcoin transactions every day worth millions of USD, and the largest transactions have been $200 million+ USD.

Fuck you. Your attitude and lack of responsibility is going to cause a complete reversal of your growth, not just put a limit on it.
It is clear to me that there is no space for centralized pools in the future of Bitcoin and your business will cease to exist. P2pool and decentralized solutions - as Bitcoin was intended to be - are the only way to go. Supporting decentralized solutions that directly compete with centralized pools such as yourself is the way to "foster innovation".

So one mistake in trusting someone negates over seven years of active Bitcoin development, 484 commits and the fact that he's the third largest contributor to the Bitcoin repository? That doesn't seem very "reasonable" to me. Or is it that you have some other agenda?
