Given bitcoin stays for the next 50 years. looking at average daily growth since the begining is around 0.3% a day. Lets take the worst case scenario and say its 0.1%. Coffee costs around 2.50. So if you invested 3000-5000 today, it should get you coffee for the next 50 years

Intresting thread, has anyone checked cboe requirments ? If i remember correctly cboe futures was a random launch, and we had just gone over 100billion market cap. Maybe its them?

I think the only should consider taking profits is if you’re in clear highs. Why sell today and not when it was 20,15,10k. 
If you work and aren’t on reliant on crypto gains and can buy more and more why would you sell? Long term 10k fiat &lt; buying 10k worth of bitcoin no matter the price. You choose whether you want to hold your wealth in deflationary system or inflationary.
I’m going to say I agree with you 100%, because every time I say that the opposite happens. So come on world. Prove me wrong !

People need to realise that you’re adding to the fire by selling. If everyone sold it would go to 0. 
I’ve personally been burnt by taking small profits, so be my guest and sell. You will regret it one day.

“No reason to jump 10x” ether you don’t understand numbers and supply/demand, or you’re an absolute idiot . Coinbase has 21 million users , they had over 1 million people joining per week during the run. Do the maths.

That really sucks . Try Wirex , you can get a card and spend crypto as euro gbp or usd

Yes but you can’t pump and dump without demand. So people saying prices were fake are wrong , I have tons of friends who bought the high. it may have been pushed up and manipulated there but the reality is people were still buying.

“If you reference some utxo that isn’t confirmed” 
Ohh I think I understand now , so the only way they support 0 conf transactions is by checking all transactions to my wallet equal more than I’m sending and the previous transactions are all confirmed ?
