Here are some that obviously fly in the face of the spirit of cryptocurrencies:
* May not keep any profit in Bitcoin.
* Forfeit Bitcoins that are inactive for over 5 years.
In the very least remove these, else you'll find that the king's laws are not respected.
Instead of mandating things, make it a voluntary program.  If the Bitcoin business acts in accordance with the program, they can display a seal of approval.  A vast majority of consumers will flock to businesses in accordance with the program.  This would be the kind of legislation that the people actually want.

The selfish miner will assume that somebody else will mine the next block on the honest chain for them, so he has no incentive to help out on the honest chain as long as the bribes are coming in.  On the flip side, should the fork win, the miner has still earned the miner reward there.

I think this is a great question.  The potential victim of the double spend attack could respond with a better offer.
In response, lets say that the attacker only pays out if the sham block is found before the next block on the honest chain.  And, let's assume that the bribe from the defender is larger than the bribe from the attacker.  (I'm going to discount the natural mining reward for now because it's not clear which fork will win out in the end.)  Then miners would naturally mine on the honest chain and claim their bribe from the defender, and the attacker pays nothing.
So a followup question is, can an attacker always force the defender to pay bribes to the miners?

I wouldn't call it a deflationary spiral, in either case of the Great Depression or Japan's Lost Decade, though we'd have to come to agreement about what a deflationary spiral means. What I mean is, both cases were deflationary episodes that were triggered by a prior buildup of a bubble, and what followed was a natural unwinding. And I agree with your analysis that this was caused by debt, which results in an inflation of the money supply, which must be contracted down. But I don't personally call that a deflationary spiral, which to me is a supposed natural phenomena of a deflationary currency.


I don't think the deflation will be significant enough to ward off debt in Bitcoins. I do think that debt will be discouraged because there is less recourse should one fail to pay back the debt. What I worry about is that it's possible for Bitcoin exchanges and wallets to operate at on fractional reserve (and who knows, maybe MtGox already is). If we don't find solutions to make holdings more transparent, then we may come to a situation where a slew of these services are suddenly insolvent. But again the irreversible nature of Bitcoin makes it so that lending is discouraged. Then again, so was gold, yet banks did it anyway.
In general I think we as a society should avoid debt like the plague. If one does lend out gold or Bitcoins to another entity, I think it is entirely at the risk of the lender. As long as this is understood, we should be able to keep debt bubbles to a minimum.

Systemic fractional reserve banking gives control over the economy to too-big-to-fail banks.  They can set the interest rate (and other levers) and determine who gets how much in loans, when.  All this ends up making the banking sector more and more powerful as they've essentially rigged the environment.
"We're in a recession!  Sorry, we're not lending any money because there's nothing to invest in."
"The economy is picking up again!  We'll lower the interest rate and let ourselves borrow some money from each other, fraudulently (but legally) inflating the money supply!  If we go too far then we'll have to bail ourselves out because we're too big to fail!"
Now lending is fine if you want to lend your money out, but you should carry the risk of default.
The exception is if the monetary system itself is *based* off of fractional reserve, which leads to systemic risk.
And that is what we have.
Actually, reality is a bit more complicated.  Since late 2008 the federal reserve has been paying interest to banks on excess reserves.  This dampens the fractional-reserve effect as banks are rewarded for *not* lending out what they otherwise would have.
@_date: 2014-01-01 01:30:27
Actually, minus all the Fed hate, I think I'm starting to respect the guy. I think he also said that there is no evidence to believe that a deflationary currency like Bitcoin or Gold would cause a deflationary spiral, that the Great Depression was caused by other factors. Can't find the link but I think he said something to that effect.
Also, in the context of the QE programs, I don't see how he could have done better. The recent changes to the banking system whereby the central bank pays direct interest on excess reserves I think has the potential to make the economy more stable than it has been before, though you never know disaster the bankers will cook up next.
All in all I think Bernanke may have gotten more flack than he deserved.

Depends on how big the transaction you're reverting is, and how many blocks it's been since your transaction was irreversibly acted upon.

It's not really a re-statement of anything out there as far as I know.
It's a simple attack, but I've never seen anybody mention it.  It's certainly not implied in the security model in the original whitepaper, nor in any other papers that I've read pertaining to Bitcoin.
Yes, miners in collusion could theoretically do whatever they want.  But people usually assume that, should the Bitcoin network be composed of many small greedy non-colluding miners, then the network cannot be compromised (except by a 51% attack).  I've shown that this may not be true at all.

Oops, I was wrong, Satoshi claimed $10M per coin.


No, no it doesn't. He pulls this out of thin air. The total value of the currency is proportional to the wealth but isn't equal to it. The reason is, money is re-used. So the more money is likely to hop around from person to person, the less money there is needed by the system.
What I've done is I've taken the amount of M1 &amp; M2 money supply (thus not counting all the bullshit derivatives in the existing markets that actually sum up to something greater than the global wealth, whatever that means), and calculated that roughly 10% of it would be in Bitcoins, for the whole world. And 40K is roughly what you get.

@_date: 2013-11-30 10:31:00
The fact that Bitcoin isn't based on interest-bearing debt money is a big deal. Since Bitcoins aren't controlled by fiat, it means debt can't be enforced. This in turn implies less wasteful spending, and less wealth bleeding into the financial system via crazy schemes involving fraction reserve &amp; derivatives.
Classical economists don't like this because for them deflation implies a reduction in jobs and a reduction in GDP. But Bitcoin shows us that when money no longer works for the people, they can create their own system of money. In the future we will have a diaspora of currencies that work better in different communities and contexts, and the crazy wealth gap disparity we see today will have been largely mitigated.
Imagine what will happen a generation from now. Kids growing into adulthood will look upon the brave new world of crypto currencies and wonder why they were left out by being born late. They will organize and create their own currency, and this new currency of the next generation will compete with Bitcoins for dominance because they offer something that Bitcoin doesn't. Perhaps access to better art or more interesting information. And the new currency will gain dominance over Bitcoin, and like this money will cycle every generation.
We can no longer steal wealth from future generations. Generational debt is no longer enforceable.

There are two kinds of "gold standard"s. One is exchanges backed by actual gold, and the other is exchanges back by fractional reserve notes backed by actual gold. The gold standard that caused the Great Depression is actually the second kind, the same kind of credit crunch that keeps happening with regularity.
Bitcoin as a currency is more like the "real" gold standard. You could argue that the Bitcoin ecosystem can also develop into a fractional reserve one, say where exchanges lend out their Bitcoins out to others exchanges, but this hasn't happened and probably never will at a large scale, especially with the public ledger that is Bitcoin, it's possible to implement auditing systems to ensure that it doesn't happen.

If the value of bitcoin always rises due to deflation, couldn't one argue that those who hold bitcoin could have purchased all the goods that he would have purchased with an inflationary currency, and still have money left over to spend on goods and services?
The point of saving money is to spend it, and nobody takes their money to the grave.
And who in their right minds would accept an inflationary currency as payment? Everybody would want to accept the currency that preserves wealth better. What currency is preferred depends on which side you're on, and since there are always two sides to a trade, perhaps it doesn't matter whether the currency inflates or deflates.
What matters then, is how the money is spent. And I'd rather choose a currency that gives more freedom to the individual.

Well, I think what we're experiencing now with the exponential rise of Bitcoin-vs-USD shows us what will happen. And, you're right. At some point people will realize that everybody is switching to Bitcoin and try to sell their USD. All the wealth stored in USD will be wiped out (barring what little strength it will have for being the mandatory form of payment for taxes). But this won't happen until the dominant form of commerce is denominated in Bitcoins, which means the impact on society will be low, say compared to other govt-fiat hyperinflation scenarios.

Just a public service announcement for Korean Bitcoin supporters: As holders and supporters of the currency, it is *your* duty to preach the virtues of the currency.
The Chinese state sponsored media is already on it. Korea is a bit late to the game. Time to step it up!

Let me play devil's advocate. As a consumer, I don't care that you the merchant is offering 50% off an item. I simply don't want to spend my money because it'll still be worth more a decade later.
What I've done in my own line of reasoning, is assume that the economists are right, and see what happens:

I saw it happen -- it was bought.

Classical Keynesian economists reject Bitcoin and other deflationary currencies categorically as a suitable global currency, but the other popular argument against Bitcoin — that it cannot continue to grow in worth because one can simply create a new alternative coin — is in fact the solution to the deflationary spiral problem.
The problem with a deflationary currency like Bitcoin is that people are incentivized to save rather than spend now, in anticipation of more purchasing power for one’s savings [1].  Since savers are presumably rational, they would choose to invest in an asset that rises in value (relative to Bitcoins) if such an asset could be found, thus dissolving the deflationary spiral.  What asset might increase in value even more-so than the primary currency itself?  Another deflationary crypto-currency, of course!
Here I will try to argue that there is selective pressure for a new deflationary crypto-currency during times of a deflationary spiral.  For the sake of argument I assume here that Bitcoin is already the sole dominant global currency, to assess what might happen in this “economist’s nightmare” scenario  (I am not advocating for a single global currency).  I need to show that this new currency (let’s call it BTC2) incentivizes all users to adopt the new currency until it becomes the dominant form of money, eventually superseding Bitcoin, meanwhile spurring new economic activity.
Consider the early adoption phase of BTC2 during a crippling deflationary spiral in Bitcoin-land.  A deflationary spiral implies low economic activity, and thus implies less opportunities for investments that yield high reward (greater than simply holding Bitcoins).  Speculators will be drawn to a new fixed-issuance deflationary currency like BTC2 for the same reason that speculators were drawn into Bitcoin — the benefit of early adoption.  Merchant-speculators will begin to accept BTC2, and as more and more wealth becomes drawn into BTC2, the early adopters will have more and more excess capital to spend on mining equipment (if the BTC2 is also based on proof-of-work), advertising campaigns in favor of BTC2, real estate, startup enterprises, etc.  Also, as more savers move their wealth into BTC2, early adopter merchants will begin to offer their merchandise for BTC2 in order to capitalize on the newly created class of consumers.
This seems counter-intuitive, that new economic activity would appear seemingly out of thin air, founded upon what some might consider to be a ponzi/pyramid/bubble scheme.  But there are no fundamental physical laws being broken here, merely a redistribution of notional (digital) wealth.  One might object that such a wide-scale switchover to a new currency (and consequently a new distribution of wealth) is irrational, but given a situation of a deflationary spiral where commerce grinds to a painful doldrum, I see no reason why the collective wouldn’t jump at the opportunity to switch to a different monetary system given a sufficient catalyst.  That catalyst is simply another bubble [2].  As a supernova explosion disrupts the gravitational congealing of matter and blows everything apart creating new activity, so does a new bubble seeded by a new currency like BTC2.
A new promising deflationary currency like BTC2 provides the perfect framework for a catalyst because it promises high yield, but people will only move their wealth into BTC2 if it appears promising.  There may be many alternative coins available to choose from, and the one that gains the most adoption and thus wins dominance by virtue of the network effect is the coin that (a) appears to hold the most promise and (b) actually delivers on its promise by not imploding too soon.  The most important factor in determining the fitness of a new coin (besides technical robustness) is how well it balances rewarding its early adopters and active participants (e.g. miners) vs long-tail adopters throughout the growth of the coin.
Once BTC2 falls into the deflationary trap, it too will become dominated by a new coin.  These coins need not appear one after the other, but will likely appear staggered and originating from different communities around the globe.  There may be multiple coins in competition that reach dominance together before they all fall into the deflationary trap one after the other, only to get replaced by yet another coin.
Perhaps there is kernel of truth to both theories held by Hakek and Keynes.  All that is needed is free competition of alternative currencies for both theories to co-exist, like two sides of the same spinning metaphorical coin.

Nah, other coins don't have the global exchange network, the merchant network, the developer network, and the mindshare.

You are already wrong. $1M/btc (in today's dollar power) is rather unattainable. Satoshi did a napkin calculation that arrived at $2M/btc, but that was silly because it completely ignores the velocity of money, and that not all wealth is in the form of a currency.

Where do you figure that 40K coins were "stolen"? The link shows an address that had received 40K since the 9th of November, and coins had been trickling in and out of the address since. Doesn't mean they were all stolen.

Clarification needed. Is Ghash.io the same as Cex?
If so, people should perhaps cash out of Cex a bit.
