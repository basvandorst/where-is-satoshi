It's reassuring to see this take here actually.  I wish everyone could just find a little more common ground.  One group wants to scale and one group at least purportedly wants to 'stay decentralized'.  I am so tired of the community being a toxic shithole.  
I consider ethereum, a forked coin, to lay as much of a rightful claim to 'ethereum' as the 'ethereum' that preceded it.  No one can sincerely claim a forked coin has less naming rights to the chain it shares than its counterpart

Like, buying a bitcoin at $940 today was a mistake?  What's being suggested?  
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:53:16
What do then?  Move it from coinbase where?

What do you see happening to the price long-term?

How does one transfer to a paper wallet?  Like from Coinbase for example

I'm confused because it seemed the whole idea with Bitcoin was to have an ultimately finite amount of currency to retain a set value.  
The "scalability" thing really just seems like code language for enabling a type of inflationary direction going forward.  I'm probably dead wrong here and just want to understand

Same here.  They have relatively high fees but you can get around those with GDAX.  Service and reliability have been stellar.  I do wish they'd release BCH to the end users already.

It appears bcore is losing marketshare to it for some reason.  Very strange

I don't think it's very comparable.  The whole market collapsed with the China news.  This time it appears btc is losing marketshare to more functional coin while that coin explodes.  Meanwhile 142k transactions flounder away unconfirmed.  This is an unmitigated disaster.

I don't see how people can argue against workers that would conceivably work 5 hours for 5 widgets, and then lose money as the widgets' value decreased to 4.9 widgets over time.  Because that's what inflation is taking away from them after everything. 
It isn't some unaccountable central authority's place to dictate how the economy should move, or mandate that workers lose money for the good of the whole economy.  Or that they owe some portion of their labor to expanding the economy.  What would you rather hold for the next 10 years?  $100k USD or 21.762 Bitcoin?  Why?

Why would lower tx fees and faster confirmation times be bad for bitcoin?  
@_date: 2017-09-20 15:20:17
To be fair, I wouldn't mind seeing the Core devs go either.

By being bitcoin and having a real usecase beyond store of value.
