Had trouble with white screen using the waveshare overlays provided by spotpear with my clone 3.5" LCD. Ending up modifying the install a bit. Sharing what I did to get the screen to work.
ssh in the pi and install the fbdev display driver;
    sudo apt-get install xserver-xorg-video-fbdev
Modify the config file;
    sudo nano /usr/share/X11/xorg.conf.d/99-fbdev.conf
To which add the following;
    Section "Device"
      Identifier "touchscreen"
      Driver "fbdev"
      Option "fbdev" "/dev/fb1"
    EndSection
save changes
Edit boot config;
    
    sudo nano /boot/config.txt
Commeted out the the dtoverlay=* entries added by LCD-show script with a 
    
    
Add this line;
    dtoverlay=piscreen,speed=24000000,rotate=270, fps=30
save changes
Pass argument to the kernel;
    sudo nano /boot/cmdline.txt
Add following arguments after "rootwait", on the same line;
    fbcon=map:10 fbcon=font:ProFont6x11 logo.nologo
save changes
Reboot the pi.  Screen should work now.
If you only have the command line, ssh back into the pi to change the boot option;
    sudo raspi-config
    
Select  "Desktop Autologin Desktop GUI, automatically logged in as 'pi' user"
If still white screen, try
    ls -l /dev/input/event*
There should be and event for each input device attached (keyboard, mouse, LCD). Can also identify the input devices with;
    cat /proc/bus/input/devices
If your "Touchscreen" is not listed, might be a hardware problem with the screen.
