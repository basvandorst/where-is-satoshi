I expect that what's frowned upon is the implied tone of bragging about how you can't be bothered to care about your several thousand dollars.

Given how long samurai were a thing and how small Japan is, I would be surprised if there were any Japanese *not* descended from samurai.

Why would you put that "of" in? I'm legitimately curious.
@_date: 2014-03-06 20:50:01
Yeah, and it's a similar construction, but "have" would be incorrect there also.

Fun fact: the idea that carrots significantly improve eyesight is a myth created by the RAF to obfuscate the fact that they had advanced radar technology.

And these are all more expensive than the going rate on exchanges. Why would anyone buy on eBay?

In fact you are wrong. Your sources show that plural use of "any" is acceptable, but they do *not* show that singular use of "any" is unacceptable. I quote your first source:


The context here is the phrase "a credit balance". One singular credit balance can be had by only one account. Plural accounts cannot share the same credit balance. If the phrase were "credit balances", only then would the plural "any" be correct.

Also, there are some common small grammar errors, like saying "If any of your accounts have" instead of "If any of your accounts *has*".

So, does locating and breaking into their offices count?
@_date: 2013-04-23 07:23:04


Sure you can. You just say, "Okay everybody, the credits you have are now called Old Credits. One hundred Old Credits are equal to one New Credit." Then when everyone is using the New Credit terminology, drop the "New" part.

I'm just saying that a real bank would be less likely to make the error, small though it is.
