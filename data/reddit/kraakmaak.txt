Wouldn't a more gradual increase at the same rate, double every two years, be better? Say the limit is increased monthly or quarterly instead of large jumps every two years

Great plan! I'm not quite sure how tipping works either :D bear hug @_date: 2014-11-10 18:28:54
wow, thanks mate!
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:32:02
True words! 200 bits u/changetip
@_date: 2014-11-10 18:29:41
How sweet :D You can even give hugs? That is nice..
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:15:02
Yes it is! I just got my first few bits tipped the other day too . Before I was mostly sniffing around some altcoins and found bicoin a bit intimidating, but now I'm considering turning what little I have into bitcoin:) it's always nice to get a few introduction coins

Cheers mate! I also started with DOGE :)

I tried to open the wallet.dat using pywallet ( and bitcoin-tools for python ( but failed (error message "ERROR:root:Couldn't open wallet.dat/main. Try quitting Bitcoin and running this
again." for those familiar)
This might be a way if anything else fails:
 or the pywallet --recover ( These tools can read the device (drive) and search for deleted keys

Wow! I think this tipping will attract a lot of new users to bitcoin. Great work, and very generous all tippers and especially !

Just mark them as spam or ignore them. Their goal is probably to hurt Ethereum for whatever reason, don't take the bait. Don't give the spammers the attention they are getting (there are tons of posts about them on several subs), just ignore and they will go away eventually
@_date: 2016-06-18 13:33:04
It is most likely fake, see the equivalent post in the ethereum subreddit.

230.93 USD

It's probably the SEPA transfer taking time. I've never had issues with Safello the times I've used them. I wouldn't worry quite yet, but ping if you do
@_date: 2016-02-01 08:19:06
Hehe. I'm still amazed people think movement in ether price is even remotely connected to spam on Reddit and/or that the spammer actually does this to benefit ethereum 
@_date: 2016-02-01 08:16:07
This. It's just some sad person spamming. If we keep posting, discussing and getting angry about it they reached their goal and will continue. A real solution would have to come from Reddit not allowing brand new accounts to send private messages 
@_date: 2015-04-26 20:54:14
Is it possible to donate from Reddit to Red Cross? 
@_date: 2019-09-20 15:59:50
Yeah, pretty clearly op is misinterpreting that data. Ethereum has twice the amount of transactions and less than half the median fee right now.
@_date: 2015-03-07 18:58:54
No damn reason is best reason ;)
@_date: 2015-02-09 22:03:44
Is it not about max block size? So the blocks wouldn't actually increase over night. Perhaps as actual size grows, new innovations can help keep bandwidth uses down
@_date: 2015-03-01 12:18:13
The man\woman has a point! 
@_date: 2015-03-07 19:02:50
thanks! good luck with your projects
@_date: 2015-02-26 22:11:43
nice try Finland
@_date: 2015-02-10 19:49:49
thanks! I see doctors without borders are not on the list? they should be! I also like causes working for water supply, e.g.  or  . Great if we can get these big players to take Bitcoin, I'll send an email today!
