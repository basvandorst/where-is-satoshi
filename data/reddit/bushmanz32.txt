Alright, look.  If he's ok with the 8% fuck everyone else trying to guilt trip you for it, they're just being jelly.  Just make sure you create an exchange account in his name wit his ID and face verified.  Have him wire the funds to the account and his part is pretty much done.  Now you buy the bitcoins through the exchange and send .4 to your own wallet and the rest to a separate wallet.  Get a Trezor put it in there so you can show him you're securing his coins.  Teach him as much as he is willing to learn, he paid for it.  Now if you could please throw a few satoshi my way when you do execute this plan.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:00:39
You sold at a loss didn't you?
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:26:48
If it ever reaches astronomical prices, that few hundred/million extra satoshis you would have gotten after waiting for a dip would indeed matter.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:16:36
Congrats bud.  Bitcoin is really taking from the rich and giving to the poor.  For now.  Just don't get greedy and cash out when your goals are met.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:58:47
Given the timing of all this shit going down I give it a 70% likelihood you're right.  They gotta fund that upcoming war some how.
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:44:20
found the guy who sold too low
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:34:12
I hope its just the 20k+ per trade but you never know.  But yeah they are probably just looking for the big fish.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:18:31
I see you too like to live dangerously.  Congrats.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:22:09
What if you trade 1k worth of bitcoins 20 times?  Isnt that considered 20k in value of trades?
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:32:31
I don't understand 80% of what you just said but my nipples are now erect.
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:02:18
You call this a sale?
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:55:32
Sounds like a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:00:55
me too.  the line charts are somewhat working though
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:33:14
Its practically gambling but yeah its possible.  Also every time you sell for a profit you have to report it on your taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:00:26
Because people are greedy and want to get rich quick.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:25:06
1.6 million satoshis!  Congrats!
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:21:45
A bunch of light bulbs pales in comparison to the kind of power BTC mining requires but thats not the reason bitcoin would be subject to a ban.
If Bitcoin really takes off it poses a real threat to the USD.  Only when this happens will the US start to think about taking it down.
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:04:43
We're talking about gains here bud.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:16:39
I watch GDAX like its my job.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:58:35
A sucker is born every minute.  Its the circle of life.  I managed to increase my holdings as well during the chaos.  It was awesome.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:38:24
I just checked your account.  Your bitcoins haven't been sent yet, they are pending from localbitcoins.  Give it a while.
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:58:21
Ok so my understanding is the broker (CME) will lose money if people are successful with the short sales, right?
So what if big money causes a huge dip?  CME hemorrhages money and everyone else will buy up discounted bitcoins.
If the shorters fail CME makes money and BTC continues to rise.
Correct me if I'm mistaken please.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:22:13
ts normal.  Go on coinbase &gt; Tools &gt; History.  You can click on your deposit under payment history and it'll tell you the date your funds will show up.
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:07:49
Not normal..  I would call them up and get an explanation.  Could be an employee trying to pull some shit.
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:43:13
They go on a wild goose chase for a bitcoin wallet.  It does mention on the show that it was worth 5k per bitcoin at the time.  But there were jabs at it stating "it could disappear out of thin air at any moment."  Overall I think it did neither harm nor good for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:12:09
IRS just had coinbase release the info of members who traded in 20k+
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:27:18
lol @ using stock market tools on crypto
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:25:36
Plenty of videos on youtube.  Just make sure you try with a small amount first.  Seen too many people freaking out about sending to the wrong address lately.
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:56:28
Please explain
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:15:24
Hell yeah its legit.  You better go drop that "bitcoin" on the comments section.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:25:33
Bitcoin backed currency?  I love it when you talk dirty to me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:25:05
The world is catching on boys.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:10:02
Who suggested kraken to you?  No phone number no address seems legit.
Try 9162733757

A warehouse full of ASIC miners in Quebec.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:36:31
phones get lost/stolen/break.  Long long term storage you should def think about a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-12-18 07:46:19
gold and bitcoin would go up as everyone panic sells their usd.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:51:24
The fees are worth it when the price drops 60%+.  But you know how fast price recovers after a drop.  Its better to pay the fee and lock in your price than to deposit and wait. 
 Sure its better to have funds locked and loaded on GDAX but I can have only so much in my USD wallet, I'm not rich.  I'm just saying I would also max my credit cards in addition of using my already cleared funds on GDAX if/when this happens.
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:54:12
Thats basically putting your life savings on BTC.  That is inadvisable. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:17:39
This is big bang theory, not Reading Rainbow.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:39:31
Pls no FUD till my funds clear.  I've got no chips for another dip.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:53:27
Bitcoin / usd takes so long to deposit.  Probably if you already had both loaded up on both exchanges.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:24:56
Now THIS is what I call a sale baby.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:32:18
Probably not.  But someone mentioned last night about the US issuing BTC-denominated Treasuries as a possibility.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:13:12
Register under your parents name.  I'm sure your parents are supportive but if not I'll vouch for you right now.  Bring mommy or daddy here right now:
Hey, your kid is really freaking smart.  Let him open a Coinbase and GDAX account with your credentials.  He'll leech less of your money if he ever becomes a college drop out playing video games and wanking all day in the basement.
You're welcome to both of you.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:46:00
If you are working for the banks:  Good god you people are relentless.  Please don't try and get people take out loans for bitcoin you're going to make enough money as it is.  That's just fucked up man.
If you aren't:  Don't.
@_date: 2017-12-03 08:31:12
Bitcoin will drop and i'll max out my credit cards on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:49:11
It dipped! buy buy buy!
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:55:44
I just have trust issues.  Don't mind me, I'm sure its a good free service with no evil plot.
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:19:44
You'll get a fee for transferring it to your brother's account.
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:50:21
Man I wish I had old rich people for friends.
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:24:37
You don't know its a bubble until it pops.
@_date: 2017-12-02 06:15:36
Probably huge but I doubt it'll happen at least any time soon.  They're going to want that sweet sweet capital gains taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:05:02
Can I be your first customer?  I'd like a loan of 10 bitcoins please at any interest rate you want.
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:57:31
Somebody failed Econ 101.
Just kidding.  Its just a misspelling of "hold".  We like to have fun here.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:07:08
It'll dip at at 12k to 9200.  
It'll last 1 minute 32 seconds.  
_____ exchange will experience problems at that time.  
You won't be able to buy until its at 11103.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:17:42
Word is definitely spreading.  Bitcoin is all over facebook.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:14:22
There ARE tax implications.  They are keeping your info per law for tax purposes.  When I said relatively safe I meant safe from hackers not safe from taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:54:49
They gotta make money some how *wink*
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:36:31
This aint your regular old wallstreet stock.  This is a new kind of beast.  Its scary.
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:59:09
coinbase* is a legit site yes you are relatively safe sharing your identity with them.
@_date: 2017-11-21 04:38:37
it just happened.  New York is asleep right now, I think it'll go down tomorrow.
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:34:52
is it a bubble?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:34:00
At the rate which this shit is climbing its cheaper to pay the fees than wait the 3-4 business days for the bank transfer to clear.
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:42:03
Uncle Sam wants his cut so hes keeping tabs.
