Are there now many bitcoin to $$$ exchanges versus one big exchange like in the MtGOX days?
I would imagine that the stolen bitcoins from MtGOX will get lost in the noise.  **If the people who lost their bitcoins don't unite and put forth some sort of ransom then what incentive is there OVER TIME for the theft to literally get lost in the noise /passage of time.**
I don't see any government **ANYWHERE** in the world standing up and saying that they have the authority / ability to get the MtGOX Bitcoins Thieves and to me that is a BAD sign in terms of what can be done when someone has your bitcoins. 
Can any exchange back their bitcoin with silver or gold?  I doubt it and who knows about their liquidity to be honest.  Who knows what exchange will be the next MtGOX????
Sorry to be so negative but I'm really looking for someone to try and respond to my questions.

When I say took the coins I mean by either electronic means or physical means in a manner which is outright theft.  
Due to the huge influence that the Banking Industry exerts on the US Government I don't see the US Government putting this bitcoin theft fiasco high on its to do list...
I think that if bitcoin people rely on the government to make things right or to get their bitcoins back they will find out that the government is not interested in finding who took their bitcoins.

the bitcoins will keep getting moved around until this is forgotten about

I was referring to the Mt Gox scandal and where those bitcoins went.
Is there some new information out there saying that the FBI confiscated the mtgox coins?  if so link please

Sounds like a good plan.

I'm suggesting people get their bitcoins back and that thieves get punished.

Find out who stole them and then go about getting the bitcoins 
The same thing the government would do if the government was so inclined to stop the bitcoin thieves.
