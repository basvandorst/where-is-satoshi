This sounds so cool. I'd love to live in a place where this is the norm.

As far as I can see this is not an exchange, it is just an aggregator. If you go to [orders]( you'll see many foreign exchanges such as Basebit or Flowbtc. The only relevant brazilian exchange I know is [Mercado Bitcoin](

OK, so somehow buying mining equipment that can generate profit in order to be "allowed to control it" affects the accessibility of Bitcoin less than doubling the block size? Fuck logic! =D

Joke's on you. I don't have any ether and no intentions to buy either. The idea doesn't please me and I think it is overcomplicated. But that doesn't stop me from being pissed at the stupid censorship present in this sub.

It's important to feel validated, you know, to keep the status-quo and the bias installed on the community. That's the oldest trick in the world.

So, only publishing content agreeing to what people already believe in, aka circle jerking? lol right

Except that shit is not result of an IT project. A 14yo with mad skilz at Dreamweaver CS2 would have made a decent job compared to that crap.

I think the FBI forgot about the "agreeable to the usages and **principles of law**" part.

After seeing hackers [exploit Super Mario World on a console using nothing but controller inputs to make it run arbitrary code]( I'm strongly against making Script turing-complete. It would be simply foolish to make any attempt at guessing the limits of what can be done if it happens.

I have been experimenting with writing software that works in a similar fashion, but for other purposes.
As of now, how does it discover nodes to connect to? Is this handled by Raft? 
Also, can I, as a merchant, create a kind of nodes blacklist/whitelist? Or will my seller node connect to everyone it finds? Keep up the good work! :)

And they actually do, because I use one of them and every month I receive the tax credit receipts from the government service.

Time to "impeach" the bitcoin core developers?

No. Just no.


I don't think I know of anyone who did that. The Bitcoin deflation (or rather lack on inflation) comes from the fact that *less* coins are produced *over time*. 
From the bitcoin paper (emphasis mine):


Nowhere in the paper any kind of deflation is mentioned. Please don't skew the facts.
