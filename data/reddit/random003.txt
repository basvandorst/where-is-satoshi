1- There weren't any bear markets in 2017.
2- Volatility trend with every bear market is down.
Pursue a refund. You wasted your money on your education.

Lower highs. Lower lows. Ever heard of a continuation of a long term trend? Can't enjoy it as I don't have any.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:21:38
It's measurable. The long term trend is down. Its value as a statistic is irrelevant.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:26:12
Yes it is. Let me spell it out for you. The volatility of bitcoin's price in 2017 is less than in 2011.

You're mentally retarded. Even a child can understand that the price fluctuated less in 2017 than in 2011.

The downtrend in volatility is still intact.

You need to install the bitcoin-utils package. Then you can use bitcoin-cli like normal.

It's way easier to hide bitcoin from government confiscation than gold or silver. It's also much easier to flee a failed country with bitcoin than with gold or silver.

Imo there is no such a thing as decentralization-friendly pow algorithm. If it is asic resistant then Intel, AMD, and Nvidia will be the new centralization point.

Here's the link for those who are curious.

The logical conclusion is that bitcoin is not decentralized. It's controlled by the majority of the hashrate. Why bother fighting the miners over the blocksize if they can 51% attack?
@_date: 2017-04-02 22:05:21
Are you sure? I checked again and it seems to match.

Inflation does the same thing? It manipulates the ratio.

Centralization leads to corruption. Corruption is extremely expensive.

I didn't claim it was immune. However, bitcoin does a better job than fiat currencies.

They're bullshitting you. Similar to climate change. They cry about climate change but continue their lifestyles with enormous carbon footprints.

That's called fiat, not cryptocurrency.

Saving is investing. Deflation is the market determined interest rate of ones labor loan to the economy.

If "but inflation is bad!" is your argument then you're not addressing the problems of deflation. Inflation being bad is an argument for 0 inflation, not deflation.
Inflation being bad doesn't make deflation good. Both deflation and inflation have their own problems.
If "but deflation is bad!" is your argument then you're not addressing the problems of inflation. Deflation being bad is an argument for 0 deflation, not inflation.


If people could use smaller denominations why did you claim deflation caused bartering? Care to clarify or revise your statement? "People started resorting to barter because dollar hoarding was so common it wasn't practical to trade using dollars anymore."


It's implied. Your solution to that problem is socialized loss. My solution is bankruptcy.


If the dollar increases in value you get more for your dollar not less.


Inflation causes the opposite. What is the significance?


Food now costing less dollars is not helpful if you make your money selling food.
Shitty businesses like I said. They bought into a bubble hoping to make money. Bubble popped and they lost their money.


Saving is investing. Someone contributed to the economy to obtain IOUs ($10,000). Deflation is the market determined interest rate of that loan to the economy.
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:10:36


People need to look into the real world history of inflation and see what actually happens, rather than imagining a fantasy world where inflation allows the economy to grow forever.


Deflation is bad because the dollar had shitty divisibility? 


People buy new cars and electronics even though they know it will lose value.


Shitty businesses should fail. Bailing out shitty businesses via socialized losses is bad economic policy.


Supply demand, not deflation.
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:44:24
Irrelevant. People use inflationary currency because it's required if they want the ability to participate in the global economy with a certain level of convenience. This is no longer true with bitcoin. Due to human nature people will prefer a deflationary currency over an inflationary currency. The consequences at the macro level won't matter.

No it doesn't.

Google doesn't use the black market rate. It uses the official exchange rate provided by the Venezuelan government. The official exchange rate is bogus.

Mediums of exchange facilitate zero-sum transfers of wealth. If a medium of exchange is not zero sum it's fraudulent.

The answer is 0. BTC was valued 0 when it first came out. The first recorded value estimate of BTC was about $0.00029 per coin about 9 months after the Genesis block was mined.

You said the volatility of Bitcoin continues to get higher and higher with every bear market. There weren't any bear markets in bitcoin in the last year. The chart you linked shows a downtrend in volatility in the ALL time frame. The ALL time frame is the only time frame that contains bear markets.

You said smart money was in btc when it first came out. Can you explain how much money was in btc when satoshi nakamoto was mining the first blocks?
@_date: 2018-02-18 06:19:56
I oppose neither in a free market. I oppose the FED increasing the money supply without permission from the citizens that use the currency.

Average joe can't fab a gpu. If gpu mining is sufficiently profitable nvidia/amd will be mining with tech out of reach for the average joe.
