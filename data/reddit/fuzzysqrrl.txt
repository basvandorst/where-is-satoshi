I think the only reason you should buy GBTC is if you are trying to hold it in your Roth IRA. I have some and it’s pretty incredible to see the tax-free gains. Otherwise you should just buy bitcoin.

I’m just trying to help out by providing a little context around potential corrections, take it or leave it as you will. I have a ton of skin in the game so I’m more than happy to see the price go up. Enjoy your day and happy hodling :)

I’d say the next dump could be down to 4500 and still be healthy. Beyond that we’d be breaking below our parabolic support and probably entering another long bear market. But I agree with your general sentiment!

You need to keep in mind that this doesn’t signal some huge policy change from PwC. I spent a few years in the Big 4; the international offices act as separate entities with only a loose affiliation with the US. That being said, it’s always good to see a big name connected with bitcoin.

Enjoy the amazing intern experience, all the wining and dining. Legitimately one of the best work experiences you will have in your life. Then gtfo of there.

If an asset you bought lost over 60% of its value I’m sure your confidence would be shaken. There’s good technical analysis that that this mental switch would happen if we dropped under 4500 from here. I don’t see it happening, I’m just pointing out there’s a nonzero chance.

Are there any estimates on when it might IPO? I've been trading the swings within my IRA but will plan on taking more profits as time winds down.

This is just some TA voodoo, but yes there's a chance it will drop if it can't jump past 4550 on gdax or 4500 on bitfinex in the short term. Long term is always bullish though.
