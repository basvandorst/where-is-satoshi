If it goes down by 90% you can buy low.

I'll buy Bitcoin, but I won't underfeed myself.

I dont know the exact term in english. I ment, you can not go full vegan without supplement (vit. B12). The right term might be *Malnutrition*? Im not sure.

That's right, they get it through the earth in the pasture. If you eat industrial meat, these animals also get it through supplements, because they are only in the stable and have no contact with the ground. But if I buy the meat from the butcher I trust, who supports the local farmers, it looks different, because they don't produce mass but have free living animals that naturally get vit. B12. I am in favour of reducing the consumption of meat, but it is not only about meat, eggs and other animal products are also important.
I am neither brainwashed nor uninformed.
Imho is a balanced rich on vegetables diet with some fish and animal products the best. Rarely some meat.
