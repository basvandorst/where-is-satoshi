You know nothing. Partnerships issue K-1s and the coin does not employ you so there is no way it is wages. If you don't know anything you shouldn't be posting false information. All we know is that crypto is taxed as property and it is not currency, check the IRS notice. It may ultimately be taxed as a commodity, equity, or debt instrument. We don't know. But, I'll tell you now that no respectable CPA will sign off on a return claiming that it is eligible for like kind exchange.

This is why the price has pulled back recently. Every soccer mom has downloaded the app and purchased $100 on BTC with their rewards credit card. They got to $150USD and now they are selling.

I think this is the whole point of the Winklevoss twins wanting an ETF. Allows them to sell their position without moving the BTC from their whale wallets which would trigger a major sell off. They would contribute their huge wallets to the ETF and take out ETF investor money.

Smart play would be to short what you want to take off the table. Wait and see if the $600 exclusion passes. If it does, then sell off your bitcoin in small transactions where your gain does not exceed $600. Like the exclusion for foreign currency under section 988 (currently $200) it is a per transaction test. It would take several orders but you could avoid tax all together if done right.

Yes, thanks. Bitcoin is a decentralized fiat currency. It is not a commodity based currency. Fiat is generally issued by governments but that is actually not a true requirement, there just needs to be some issuing entity. Disney dollars are fiat but Disney is not a government. In the case of Bitcoin the government part is replaced with a program that controls supply until a set amount is issued.

The banks have trillions to lose when their business model gets blown up. They want to take Bitcoin to the grave and keep it there, make an example of it.

I think he only moved like 100 million so far. What do you do when you transfer Bitcoin to an exchange? Clearly the intent was to crash the price.

I think the "surge" is way overblown. The truth is that there are a lot of hedge funds and whales that got in several years ago and they are looking for an out that doesn't tank the market. We should respect that they don't simply dump the coins. ETF's will open the markets some but the base of BTC that they start with will come from the whales.

This was cancelled because subjecting crypto to an excise tax, tax on the gross amount rather than adjusting for acquisition cost and just taxing gain, goes against common accepted practices of the taxation of property exchanges. Crypto should be taxed on a net basis but there should be an exemption for amounts under a certain value, say $1,000.

If they did buy the price up then they have done a poor job by letting it slip the past few days. The recent minor correction has cast doubt on the future price. They don't care about the actual price of BTC because they cannot get enough leverage on it. The futures contract on the other hand they can leverage 20x or more.  If they wanted to profit on a short futures bet they would want everyone thinking 100k by new years is likely, then dump BTC
@_date: 2019-03-15 01:29:40
It doesn't have to be actual dollars, no bank actually keeps that liability on the books anyways. The problem is that they have significantly stretched what constitutes a dollar of value and taken on significant risks.

Both of their services result in people parking their BTC with blockfi. They split the interest with you if you open an interest account.

It actually is a big difference. A rejection would set precedent, send a more negative signal, and limit refiling by the applicant. It was likely that the SEC needed to get it's policy in place before being able to provide a favorable ruling. The fact that the submission hasn't changed supports this. With a policy in place now for crypto ETF the SEC probably reached out and said now we can work with you

I'll give you that it is easier to move across boarder but that factor is addressed in the portability rating. If someone knows you have Bitcoin they cannot physically take it without your giving the private key but so what if they throw you in jail until you give it up, or put a fun to your head.

That is not true. I assume you're talking about section 988 of the Internal Revenue Code which exempts some foreign currency transactions if the gain is under $200. The IRS position remains that crypto is not currency per the 2014 notice. Until there is tax guidance on point there is no reasonable basis for taking a contrary position.

Yes but they would be scared of the mass flood of money into btc as a result of the etf opening the market the average person. Thus making the short way too risky. The average investor does not mess with futures, that's an insiders game.
 The reason there are no ETFs is because what wall street and institutions want is very different than what the public want. The SEC didn't deny the ETF applications, they asked that the submitters pull the request. The SEC has no legal basis for denying the application, they couldn't. This should be a huge red flag. They basically had a back door meeting with the ETF guys and said no way can we let this happen, the institutions won't let it, we have no legal recourse but if you proceed we will destroy you personally. The SEC is a guardian of the institutions. Wall Street and banks don't want to get into BTC because they cannot control or influence it. Think about it this way, would an institution buy into a company that they cannot control and 20% is owned by an unknown individual? No way. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 00:12:53
Yes but they are not stupid, they can hedge away all risk by also carrying the underlying asset. Futures were the worst thing for Bitcoin without launching ETFs at the same time to counter the temptation to manipulate the price down.

Satoshi group just put the pieces together. The white paper is really a marketing piece written for the masses. To properly cite all of the influences for Bitcoin and discuss the technical workings it would have been a much longer and complicated piece. There is no doubt they pulled from this form of digital cash. But remember there were lots of digital cash systems around that time. Digital gold was one that was not cited either.

Clearly you do not understand the fractional reserve allegation. It's all about proving that the exchanges have not loaned out customer's Bitcoin.

I think the theory is that some exchanges are lending the Bitcoin they have to shorters. By withdrawing, the shorters would have a margin call of sorts and be forced to buy Bitcoin on the market or close their position. If there theory is right, a bank run would raise the price of Bitcoin. If they are wrong, they taught people about the importance of controlling private keys. 
Funny thing is, those that leave their Bitcoin on the market stand to be able to sell at a nice profit.

The other was much faster but honestly doesn't matter, who's waiting for confirmation before selling something less than $5? Also how many mobile wallets even let you easily reverse or spend funds that have already been broadcast to the network?
