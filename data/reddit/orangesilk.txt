"People strong enough in mind" "prey tell" You should probably work on your english before trying to pretend you're english.
Go back to Krasnoyarsk comrade Yuri.

You've been posting the same thing in all related threads multiple times.
Russian sock puppets are so obvious nowadays. 
@_date: 2018-05-30 06:33:08
I don't even understand what you were trying to say with "You know when your beat as the reply is weak". That's not even shitty english, that's a word salad.
Товарищ Юрий, ты поддельный и веселый.

But... If you believe in the technology then you'd prefer selling and buying constantly to make Bitcoin look more like a currency and less like volatile investment assets. As it is now what Bitcoin needs is for it to be accepted as a way to commerce stuff.
Unless you're not into the whole decentralized currency thing and just want a lambo for cheap. I can understand that feeling but then stop trying to act morally superior by holding onto a devaluing asset. True believers like the pizza guy don't actually care about the btc to USD conversion rate.

Okay, so here's a question: If bitcoin price goes so low that mining is unprofitable then people will stop mining (This is specially true after the halvening). If people stop mining then it'll be very easy for someone to have 51%+ of the hash right? And if that happens then wouldn't bitcoin instantly become 100% worthless and die on the spot?. Am I missing something here? 
This means that as the price goes lower we steadily approach the one true death of Bitcoin, unless there is something about the system that I don't understand.

Here's the thing, who do you think is losing that money? Certainly not the customers. No one's money in particular is stored in a fucking ATM.
So the guys losing money would be the bank, but let's be honest, those things are probably insured.
So, the insurance company? But that's literally their business, losing money when something awful happens to you. Because they are making it by doing nothing when things are going fine.
So, a natural disaster happened and an insurance company will probably cover it. Big deal. As far as I'm concerned this is like you showing me a picture of a flooded house and going "Isn't it much better to just live in a tent in the park?".
Because let's be honest, there's a lot of safety systems for customers in regular fiat banking. Something extraordinary would have to happen for you to lose your life savings. 
With crypto, If you lose your password or get hacked or whatever, then you're shit out of luck.

Ah, I saw that dumb as fuck Cointelegraph article.
Reciting a clickbait article header is really the kind of quality content I expect from this thread. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 13:46:51
It's the large cetaceans that really drive the market right now. Buy when low, sell when they pump, and hope you're lucky enough not to end up holding their bags.
@_date: 2018-11-26 11:35:22
The last pump n dumps before the whole thing starts crashing down. Make sure to buy when it's expensive and then hodl so you can help the economy by carrying the bags of those smart enough to leave.
@_date: 2018-11-25 09:01:32
You wanted a get rich quick scheme and it didn't pan out. No biggie, same could have happened with stock or a casino really.
@_date: 2018-11-28 11:04:22
Gonna be pump n dump. Sell at 4.2k, laugh at the hodlers.
@_date: 2019-01-14 15:38:23
Great news for the environment!
@_date: 2019-01-21 14:42:33
He's telling you to sell, because clearly everyone but the tinfoil hats selling and going away is Good For Bitcoin (tm).

Comrade Igor, we will not convince these westerners that pointing a gun at voters is still legitimate democracy.

This whole "The shape will go exactly like this and this and that" is about as accurate as astrology.

I think this thread showcases perfectly the insufferable "Crypto Bro" that plagues office buildings all across the globe.
Y'all actually think you know more about economics than a literal Nobel Prize in economics. And it's because you read HODL memes and get your news from a crypto circlejerk that dumbs down the facts so that even the dumbest of the dumb can feel like the Wolf of Wallstreet for holding onto a couple bitcoins.
"Rescind his economics Nobel Prize", says a guy that has been holding onto an asset that lost 60% of its value over the past five months. Sure thing Billy.

If you want a get rich quick scheme then you want big banks to get in the game.
If you want it to be the coin for the future you have to spend and buy constantly, buy pizzas instead of hodling.
You can't have your cake and eat it

Coal will probably hold its value better over the course of the next month than BTC. What I'm saying is, sell your BTC and buy actual, physical coal.

The thing is that the very same guys that the crypto community hates are those who are taking advantage of the lack of regulations and the blind faith of Bitcoin believers to make a quick buck.
Those who only Hodl and buy make it extremely easy for Big Money to pump-n-dump Bitcoin, there will always be someone willing to hold their bags after all. Those resources you're "commiting to Bitcoin" are just going to the pockets of the same big investors as always while the actual value of the currency keeps going down.
Don't use it as a store of value or investment asset, don't expect your 2018 BTC buys to get you a Lambo, buy pizzas with it. If you Hodl to the moon you're just looking for a get rich quick scheme and not at all into the technology. Use it as a goddamn coin goddamn.
@_date: 2018-12-17 15:58:04
Yes, this is the right moment to buy, this is in no way a pump n dump like we've been seeing all around 2018.
@_date: 2018-12-07 14:06:15
But think of how much tinfoil you could buy with that many US dollars.
@_date: 2018-12-10 07:53:01
Inflation is peanuts compared to what happened to BTC in 2018.
And regarding salary stagnation, it's largely the fault of the very same guys that pumped and dumped BTC to where it is today. So BTC does not in any way protect you from the big money owners.
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:21:55
Log charts are so manipulative for stuff like this.
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:20:55
Lul, it's been getting pump n dumped like crazy by mid-size investors, like, no need for big institutional money to come in. Bitcoin is volatile as hell and the US government could make the price sink without even doing anything just by putting the words "Bitcoin" and "regulations" in the same sentence.
@_date: 2018-12-09 06:23:35
After the price has collapsed from 17k to 3.4k, no coiners are really damn happy.
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:21:06
Okay but keep in mind, as a speculative asset if people stop talking about it it will die off quickly. You kinda want journalists to be talking about Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-12-11 13:30:31
Just like Bitcoin!

Well, seeing how the ungrateful little brat thinks his dad is a moron for not predicting stock prices decades in the future I'll say that investment went badly.
@_date: 2018-12-10 10:23:16
To be fair, maybe the thread has been fuddy this last year because BTC has lost 70% of its value last year.
