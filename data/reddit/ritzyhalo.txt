Tipping is tipping, what if doge became $20 a coin one day?

Damn... Didn't know about that.. That's absolutely insane O.o

For now I'd hold on to them with a this attention to bitcoin recently

You can never truly be sure, bitcoin can jump to just about any price. Some predict 10000 a bitcoin, some 2000, some predict a crash.

I know :( with that big Silk Road shutdown though, I think that opened the idea up to some more people :D

If you explain how it works, and actually show how it works (maybe by giving them a 0.005 head start, then showing how the transaction went through blockchain) they might actually get a sense that this is the real deal. OP was simply just trying to explain the aspect of how it's value is still unstable, and could crash overnight.

OP, can I get some tips for raising some awareness in your school? I want to spread the word as well, but not sure how to go about it. It just feels kinda awkward talking about bitcoin to people who have no idea what it is, or have even heard of it.

Hmmm.... Interesting question, willing to bet it might be possible, but defeats some of the purpose of bitcoin, it being anonymous and all so I'm not so sure it would work out if it was a thing.

Sorry, didn't mean completely anonymous, just compared to other currencies on the internet, it's much harder to track. Of course though, cold hard cash will always be more anonymous

I... I feel so bad for you....

Not so much a scam, but don't open every email you have. Recently (even at my fathers workplace) hackers will do what's known as a "drive by" download (downloads malware due to an email, website ect. without you knowing) and will encrypt ALL of your data, making it inaccessible, and they want you to pay I believe somewhere around 1-2 bitcoins to decrypt it.

Eh little late for it now :p, but luckily they frequently made back ups, just was a bit of a scare that this could happen. Wish more people knew about this
