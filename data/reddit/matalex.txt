Yes, and thank you for responding. 500 bits

Oh and I don't think the tip worked btw

There are very little jobs as society has become much more efficient. Self driving cars, autonomous companies etc. People are joyously creating from their own imagination much more and people are becoming more introspective.
Everyone is wearing mini cameras that are recording to the cloud constantly, people can view other peoples streams by paying in bitcoin.
Major issues for society are voted on with blockchain technology making true democracy.

I just wanted to say thanks for this, we didn't expect to be featured on your site and appreciate it!

Thanks for answering, is this an "off-chain" service? Can bitcoin change the confrimation time of the block-chain?
@_date: 2014-05-13 15:08:57
First bitcoin tip! Thanks, it actually means a lot...this small gesture will be carried forward and together we can all change the current paradigms :)

Biggest reason I can see is you will be able to hold the ETF inside a tax deferred or tax free savings plan/vehicle thus avoiding or minimizing capital gains taxes.

Just asking because some people are questioning this as a made up publicity story.
@_date: 2014-05-30 04:44:05
Can bitcoin match dogecoin's 1 minute confirmation time?
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:05:52
Genuine question, thanks for the informative answer.
@_date: 2014-05-13 15:16:50
Awesome my friend! Good luck! Thailand is beautiful and I can't wait to go back. Koh Phangan and Pi were two great places I enjoyed.

Thank you for your comment and info.
@_date: 2014-05-13 05:16:05
That is an excellent idea and that's how I have doge right now but I like bitcoin just the same! However, I have never been tipped bticoin. Which is fair since I haven't posted much here.
+100 doge
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:22:07
I see, well no need to be defensive my friend. I understand that but there will always be trolls, you should perhaps welcome the many crypto-enthusiast children that doge has brought. Save your hate for the fiat trolls :)
@_date: 2014-07-08 16:36:42
Perhaps the conflict could come from bad guys wanting to centralize and control things...could be a cool way of showing the problems as they are today
@_date: 2014-06-16 23:02:12
Actually it did come through once I re-logged in!? Here is the duplicate back! :)
10 mickeys Thanks!

I think you need to put 1 good idea

What about the random keys generated from bitcoinpaperwallet.com 
Are these generated keys safe?
@_date: 2014-06-16 22:34:10
I have not, I kinda wish it was it BTC not USD
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:01:25
Totally agree! I made the same mistake of not looking into Bitcoin further when I first came across it 2+ years ago. It was $10....if only I would have researched a little further and come to these conclusions earlier. Ah well, it may be that we are still in the beginning and it also may be that it will fail but at this point I see that becoming a smaller possibility of the two.

Haha nice! Ok you guys are awesome! Now that I have some little bitties I will be tipping them forward and sharing the wealth and love. Thanks :)

I don't think that is a valid moniker ? I didn't receive

A health care system that benefits the healthy is something I would like to see.
Roads that are built of solar panel could pay for themselves. 
Things are changing, time to think creative and stop holding onto antiquated systems.
@_date: 2014-06-27 20:15:29
Indeed, perhaps through crowd-funded bitcoin donations and other cryptos. 
That prospect excites me...
