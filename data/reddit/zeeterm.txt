This actually reminds me of a piece of work I did for a previous employer where I was modelling the reliability of water pumps*.
I'll try to remind myself how we dealt with this framing problem, subject of course to what I'm able to disclose about that work.
I guess if you go over the limit then stay over the limit, for 3 more blocks, then I would as a statistician see that as "3 occurrences" in the "1 in 50 years" rule, but I see also how that wouldn't be desirable, because the correlation would push the false positive rate from the perspective of users much lower.
\* For example, they might model 6 water pumps, and want to see how often more than 4 fail in a 24 hour period. The maths behind that is roughly applicable to this, and I even seem to remember some results being distribution independent, depending only on the means instead.

It's not nefarious, just unusual, particularly the odd level of localization. (Blacklisting google.co.uk but not others? A not very comprehensive list of exchange sites).
It is also unusual to have configuration in this manner, given it is open source and easily forked, configuration would be more transparent if in a separate clearly marked configuration section.

Thanks for the reply. I am not sure I agree there isn't a "bug", since a miscalculation is a bug, especially when the code is documented using a calculation that says it triggers every 50 years.
Subdividing into 4 hour spans is a massive under-estimation which does not at all reflect reality. That isn't a case of "well it's just an underestimate", it just isn't a working model for what is going on.
Secondly, the pdf/cdf issue isn't actually that minor, here's the fact it is out by, assuming we are always using poisson(24).

It should be based on cumulative poisson, I'll run the maths and double check because I'm not sure that is correct.
We are after Prob(X &gt;= n) where X ~ Poisson(rate * timespan), which should be 1 - Pr(X &lt; n) where X ~ Poisson (rate * timespan).
Without knowing the library, it may be that the threshold is calculated using the probability of exactly 48 rather than 48 or more.
edit1: I'm just installing scipy now so I can run the numbers properly and combine them side by side with the output of the algorithm in core.
edit 2: The following code needs checking, even without difficultly it thinks it should be false positive approximately 1 in 2 years, which seems wrong to me. It may be that independence does not hold here. (Although as a "stopping time" I feel like it ought to.)
	from scipy.stats import poisson
	mu = 24 # We expect 24 blocks in 4 hours
	x = 48 # We want to know if we have 48 or more blocks
	# The "4 hours" is never explicitly used, as that drops out of the equation 
	# because it included in the fact that we "expect" 24 blocks in that time.
	 probability of having 48 or more blocks is 1 minus the probability 
	# of having 47 or fewer blocks mined.
	# Therefore is 1 - cumulativePoisson(47,24)
	pvalue = 1 - poisson.cdf(x - 1,24)
	# This should happen approximately 1 in timeblocks times.
	timeblocks = 1 / pvalue
	# timeblocks * 10 minutes in years
	# timeblocks / 6 (hours) / 24 (days) / 365.25
	years = timeblocks / 6 / 24 / 365.25
	print('{0:0.16f}'.format(pvalue))
	print('{0:0f}'.format(timeblocks))
	print(years)
The result of which:
	&gt;python reddit.py
	0.0000104284327727
	95891.685913
	1.82317449831
But this needs checking, it seems way too frequent for getting twice the blocks expected!
Edit3: Even if independence doesn't hold, to get an upper bound we could pretend we sample 4 blocks, then reset completely and sample 4 more, which would simply multiply the final years result by 4, which would still be way less than 50 years.
edit4: I'll run the numbers now with the incorrect p-value calculated (the non-cumulative).
edit5: I ran the numbers but I'm still not close to 50 years, even using the wrong p-value straight from the pmf I'm getting 3.5 years:
	from scipy.stats import poisson
	mu = 24 # We expect 24 blocks in 4 hours
	x = 48 # We want to know if we have 48 or more blocks
	# The "4 hours" is never explicitly used, as that drops out of the equation 
	# because it included in the fact that we "expect" 24 blocks in that time.
	 probability of having 48 or more blocks is 1 minus the probability 
	# of having 47 or fewer blocks mined.
	# Therefore is 1 - cumulativePoisson(47,24)
	pvalue = 1 - poisson.cdf(x - 1,24)
	# This should happen approximately 1 in timeblocks times.
	timeblocks = 1 / pvalue
	# timeblocks * 10 minutes in years
	# timeblocks / 6 (hours) / 24 (days) / 365.25
	years = timeblocks / 6 / 24 / 365.25
	print("Using correct p-value")
	print('{0:0.16f}'.format(pvalue))
	print('{0:0f}'.format(timeblocks))
	print(years)
	 p-value
	badPvalue = poisson.pmf(48,24)
	badTimeblocks = 1 / badPvalue
	badYears = badTimeblocks / 6 / 24 / 365.25
	print("Using pmf p-value")
	print('{0:0.16f}'.format(badPvalue))
	print('{0:0f}'.format(badTimeblocks))
	print(badYears)
	Using correct p-value
	0.0000104284327727
	95891.685913
	1.82317449831
	Using pmf p-value
	0.0000054095762706
	184857.362199
	3.51466579585
What I'm not clear on is how even the incorrectly calculated p-value could be tripping the "1 in 50 years" alarm, unless there are further bugs which are outside of the scope of this function.
All in all this is my first time reading the core code and I'm a little disappointed by the coding style. The statistics should be separated from the displaying of the error at the very least so it can be unit tested.

Yeah, the whales moved in (or should I say out) a couple of hours ago. They immediately busted the 260 wall, took their time to bust 250 but after that is was free fall.
Down to 141 and falling.
Whoever was buying at 261, whether an optimistic whale or the market as a whole (Some insight someone else said earlier was that it was a technical barrier from an earlier price point), must surely feel sick right now. They kept price stable for 12 hours only for it to slip from their grasp so quickly once they ran out of capital.

According to the wisdom graph I've had open since this morning, 5853 coins were sold in that minute. That was plenty enough to not just bust the 300 buy wall but create a ~28k sell wall at that price and there wasn't much remaining support as the market dipped all the way to 275 briefly.
The sell wall stayed at 300 rather than moving lower so rather than crashing further the price is hovering just below the wall, although it looks like simply not enough people want to buy to eat into the current wall.

You're reading that wrong. That 120k is a positive liability, it is 120k bitcoins that mtgox owes itself. It doesn't belong anywhere on a balance sheet but then whoever was doing this document wasn't good at accounting. Nor were mtgox for that matter.
Their liabilities state they have a 625k liability to others +120k liability to mtgox but -80k liability because frozen accounts they don't have to pay out to. All in all this leaves a positive liability (in their mind a positive liability being how much you owe).
Their assets show 2k bitcoins.

If withdrawls were open it would shove the price up on Gox as everyone tried to get their USD out of gox via withdrawing BTC, the price on gox would go supernova.

Mouth breather?
Please don't misunderstand me, I think the chances of gox opening BTC withdrawls and keeping usd withdrawls frozen is tiny, probably less than 1%.
But if that were to happen, this is what would happen. USD would be devalued on gox relative to BTC, making the gox price astronomical. It would be a high goxUSD/BTC ratio but, goxUSD would be as meaningless as GoxBTC is now.
This means on gox *only*, the price would be very expensive, it would represent the cost of getting USD out of gox.
I'm not suggesting that anyone should trade on gox now because of this.

Not just a buy wall, but the way the numbers don't go up in single increments is odd, you'll often see a large sell push matched price down to 261, but then it often skips back to 264 or so.
It's as if gox aren't using a good best-match algorithm.
Price differences can allow a dishonest exchange (I'm not suggesting gox isn't honest) to "skim" the exchange.
Let's say Alice has bid offers in at 30 40 Bob comes in and asks for 70
An honest exchange will report to Bob that he sold 30 and 40 meaning that while he offered to sell everything for 18340, because Alice already offered to buy some at 263 then Bob actually got 18370. Alice pays the 18370 she bid. A dishonest exchange will report to Alice that she paid the 18370 she bid, but report to bob that he got the 18340 that he offered at, and the exchange will skim the 30 difference.
An honest exchange will use best-match algorithms to avoid skimming and will keep the exchange fair and liquid. A dishonest exchange will see more odd patterns to their announced prices.

Betfair. 
It's a gambling exchange not a financial exchange, but actually the volatility in a live running cricket game is pretty close to cryptocoins. Long periods where little happens then sudden new info (A wicket falls, someone scores a boundary) can cause sudden shifts.
It is a gambling exchange, but if you consider a fixed payout on a certain result, e.g. £100 for an england win, then you can consider the "price" to be the amount you would need to bet to get that payout. If england are almost certain to win, there might be an effective buy price of £90 to secure a £100 payout, if they're getting thrashed then £1 might buy you that payout.
Betfair have reorganised their site but I'll try to dig out where they explain market matching.
Edit to add: It's hard to explain, but here's a market for a live football match.

11ty: The transaction volumes show that while yes, the 261 wall was eventually depleted, this wasn't a crash based on pulled bids, this was actually someone shoving a lot of BTC into the market to sell.
I watched it live, the sell orders came in 200BTC chunks. They'd push 200BTC to market at around $10 under market price, let the price chunk downwards as they swallowed the market prices. Then they'd pause for around a minute, let the market put some new "turf" down and let the walls build up a bit then shove 200 more BTC on repeating the process.
They steadily sold all the way down from 260 to 135. They actually took several "run ups" to break the 200 sell wall as it was quite formidable.
I don't know if you can find the entire live order book order by order but it is fascinating. Rewatching it on time-delay (sped up a little) would be informative.

Mtgox effectively froze USD withdrawals some time ago. This decoupled the gox price from other exchanges because now it was btc/goxUsd instead of btc/USD.
This meant the Gox price appeared about 20% over other exchanges.
Then recently, gox froze btc withdrawals. This decoupled the other side too, so now gox was dealing goxbtc/goxUsd. 
Now that the btc were goxbtc the price crashed as people assessed goxbtc were worth a tiny fraction of real btc. Note that it crashed to 100 goxusd. That is even less than 100usd. The market assessed a roughly 20% chance of goxbtc ever being worth a btc.
Now the market is reassessing their assumption on the other side, the 20% premium of USD to goxusd is looking a bad assumption, and that goxusd are probably worth less than that. This is pushing the price of gixbtc up in goxusd terms.
At this point this is not the market having more faith that goxusd will be worth a btc, it is the market having less faith that goxusd will ever be worth a USD.
Gox has all the power, if they announced swift withdrawals on one side but not the other they can recouple one side causing huge swings.
They are unlikely to do this. It is looking increasingly like their cupboard is bare.

Indeed. I didn't sleep last night and watched the whole thing from the bizarre 261/260 freeze all the way down to 135 live, and said at the time that if it was insider knowledge then it was bad news coming.
 (Some people bizarrely think that this sell would be insider knowledge of good news, so they could drive down the price before buying it cheap before the good news. They are fools who don't understand exchanges and liquidity and how to make money on inside knowledge.)
It was clear huge sell offs were happening, the price didn't crash on fear or withdrawls of liquidity, it was traded all the way down, the whole order book was eaten.
What isn't clear is whether it was inside information, inside coins being sold, or just a whale predicting correctly that by mid afternoon Tokyo time that no news having come that day meant no real news would be forthcoming that day.

What's odd is that there appears to be a price floor at gox. The price simply won't go below 261.
A sharp bottom to the price, it's as if someone is buying almost endless amounts at 261.
What's also odd is that sometimes the bid and offer prices are listed as the same, which isn't possible in a well ordered exchange (there would be exchange at the agreeable price), but that may be a bug in bitcoinity.

Initially it seems odd. To do business with a site that has announced it won't process withdrawals of USD, that seems to take a very long time processing money withdrawals elsewhere and that had announced it would not even be processing bitcoin withdrawals.
But, this was an opportunity, an opportunity to finally be a man and own a whole bitcoin, for only $200 or so. An affordable amount to get on the bitcoin ladder.
Never underestimate greed. Ever. This thread and others illustrate powerfully just how greed can trap a lot of people. Most people do not have the intelligence to be able to tell gox was suspect. Many people report getting there straight from Google or the official bitcoin site bitcoins.com, and surely an official site from bitcoin wouldn't point to a scam! 
To actually be able to be scared off of gox required reading reddit threads and piecing information together. Even many redditors in the last week clung to the belief it would all play out OK. Even today some still do, although that number has dropped.

It's not great work at all.
Here's the thing, it's unlikely to attract much "new money" into the exchange, who would want to touch gox now?
Given that, to recover all the "losses" through fees, it's fees coming from the existing customer base mostly trading amongst themselves.
In the end that's just equivalent to just taking the haircut now. Do you really want to shuffle your 100btc around until you actually only have 10btc left because you've spent 90btc on fees?
Sure, this way there are some "winners" and some "losers", but without a huge amount of new cash in the system then overall it doesn't actually create the money needed to get out of the liabilities.
Knowing an exchange is insolvent it would be utterly foolhardy to trade there, they could choose bankruptcy at any time.

That's not true,because 
a) there is also capital expenditure; This is a larger proportion of the cost for ASIC mining vs GPU mining
b) price is governed by more than just supply cost
For many alt coins (and btc in the past), miners were losing money mining because the growth of miners was outstripping the value from the mining. Often the general price increases lifted everyone into "profit" but actually the miners technically had losses from a *coin perspective.
"In the long run" doesn't apply because any given mining rig doesn't run "in the long run". Mining rigs are only effective at mining for a short time before the network grows to a point where that rig is no longer efficient at mining.

If only else was curious like me as to why you pick 31 cards of 52, I did the maths to save you time!
31 cards of 52 is 52 choose 31, which is 52!/(31!21!). But the 31 can be in any ordering so we multiply that by 31!, which leaves 52!/21! Different permutations of 31 of 52 cards.
If we take the log base 2 of this ln(52!/31!)/ln (2) we get just over 160. This means there is just over 160 bits of entropy in this data given a good random shuffle.
Why 160 bits? Well wallets are addressed with ripe160, so anything more than 160 bits would go to waste since the crypto itself only has that much entropy.
@_date: 2014-02-19 20:31:43
It could be. Gox has the power to buy as much BTC at 261 as they like then sell it on other exchanges for market price.
Being able to buy super discounted bitcoins from ones own exchange could get any company out of a solvency crisis.
The longer this goes on the more money they're making, they may have no desire to quell any rumours. All the while that no one can withdraw from gox except themselves they are free to print money.
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:33:35
OK, but in effect you do still rely on mouse and keyboard for entropy, even though a live disc will typically used straight after booting when that source is lower than usual?
I'm not saying it definitely is a problem but I will say it is a concern and would recommend users use the system for a bit for unrelated tasks before using it to generate any keys.
Edit: Also your online one is not touch friendly, it isn't picking up the keyboard events.

I think you'd be better off expressing it as "amount to bet" and "likelihood" and then calculating the "Cross bet" amount from that yourselves.
Even as a seasoned exchange better this talk of "bet amount" and "Cross bet" is confusing.
If you look at betfair they have a good system for exchange betting that seems to work very well for both casual punters (who will only ever back) and traders (who tend to back and lay). [Although with automatic crossmatching in a 2 horse race a back is a lay for the other entrant so it's equivalent anyway].

I had already assumed it could anything from 00000000 to 99999999!
Please read 
Likelihood of collision is proportional to the square root of the number of options, so roughly speaking an up to 8 digit long number will be more likely than not to collide after a 4 digit number of IDs being generated.
If there are 100000000 IDs to pick from, that's (roughly) 10000 before you're more likely than not to have a collision. (It's slightly higher than that because there's also a sqrt(2 ln(2)) factor, but that is neglible).
For instance if you want to avoid collision and aim for 1000000 transactions you need an ID space of at least 1000000000000, and even then that only gets you to a coin flip whether you avoid one, to make it very unlikely you don't get a collision you need to go much larger.
Random IDs Need to be very large to avoid collision, this is why UUIDs are so long, e.g. b948372c-b491-4763-9102-343cab75138c
This is very large and rather uncompressable. For this reason I would question the use of random rather than sequential IDs at all in an API, especially when an API consumer would probably want to keep track of which IDs they have previously downloaded and be able to ask for IDs since a given ID.

Sending money over the internet was dangerous. PayPal fixed this by always putting the risk on the other party, swallowing the risk themselves.
Paypal swallowed the risk of chargebacks, weighing it against their fees. When they became more dominant they pushed more risk onto the sellers which also helped them reduce their risk, but by this time customers were used to the "risk free" nature of dealing with paypal who swallowed their risk.
Bitcoin is the opposite, it pushes all the risk back to end parties, "buyer beware". Bitcoin actually needs a paypal like entity to take the risk off the endpoints.

Bitcoins can be eroded through controlled inflation, it is called the promisary note.
In a world where btc has taken off, the Bank of England can print a piece of paper saying "I promise to pay the bearer of this note 1satoshi" and it would instantly be currency. 
If people believe their ability to pay they can continue to print these notes. Eventually when this note is accepted anywhere they could even declare that they are going to abandon the bitcoin standard and just print notes without the underlying bitcoin.
This is particularly easy to accept by people if the satoshi has deflated to a point where 1 satoshi is a bit unwieldy.
Of course it isn't in their interest to do this, they would be better off keeping the currency they have now.

A BTC exodus would push the price high on their exchange, which would attract BTC which can quickly be deposited, so I don't think a BTC exodus would worry them.
Remember that when Gox halted USD withdrawls they operated months when only BTC and other currencies could be withdrawn. This pushed the price above other exchanges and even near the end when it was clear they had major trouble people still transferred in BTC because they saw the higher prices and got greedy.
I'm not making a comparison between stamp and gox here but I'm just pointing out that a BTC exodus likely wouldn't cause headaches. A larger headache would be a fiat exodus which would crash the price on stamp but likely wouldn't tempt users in the same way (and any fiat withdrawls take longer to clear so they could have liquidity issues even when fully solvent.)

No, I'm bearish because if it really does become the de-facto currency, then I'll be getting paid in BTC, so I don't have a stake in seeing that happen. On the other hand, if it doesn't go "to the moon" then by investing I'd stand to lose a lot.
I am bearish because I don't believe that those who currently control the wealth would "let" all of that slip and suddenly a bunch of people who happened to be early adopters of btc would be billionaires.
BTC could take off, but it would require a government to back it, and they'd likely just start their own alt-coin version which would crush the "old" bitcoin very quickly if any government gave a clone its backing.
So yeah, I'm bearish because the capacity for any government to crush BTC is much larger than the likelihood of adoption of *this* bitcoin.
But, it's fun to watch and I do wish I had a little btc, but I don't think it is worth buying.

Actually, between difficultly adjustments, the number of blocks you can mine is independent of how much other people are mining.
If at the current difficulty you can mine ~1block/day, it doesn't actually matter if there's no one else on the network or if someone turns on a machine hashing 200/day, until the difficulty changes you'll get your 1block/day.
Miners don't actually compete with each other to mine blocks, they compete with random chance which is independent of others activity.
I know that sounds  strange, but if you model it you'll see it's true. It's counter-intuitive but there you go.
Source: A degree in mathematics with statistics.
That means if your ROI becomes negative, you might as well shut off your mining equipment until the difficulty re-adjusts, if others turn off their equipment your ROI is not improved. (In this example, even if you were the only person left mining, that doesn't mean you get 1 block every 10 minutes, you still get 1 block per day but the whole network only gets 1 block per day until the difficulty re-adjusts).

Ok, you're right about that, but:
What you've actually demonstrated there is that you get 36BTC/day at a given difficultly independently of how many others are mining, which is in complete agreement of what I've said.
What would happen therefore is people move to the lower difficultly weeks and abandon the higher difficulty weeks which further de-stabilises the difference between easy and hard weeks.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:05:16
However, due to the probabilistic way mining works, fewer competitors doesn't increase the rate at which you find blocks.
While it's true it increases your probability, the expected time for you to find a block doesn't change, instead the expected time for anyone to find a block increases.
Imagine you were the only miner left, with just a GPU miner. You've now got 100% chance of finding the next block, but the difficultly hasn't yet adjusted, so it'd still be years before you found that block.

Right now, with the price dropping as low as it is, miners stand to lose money by mining because the cost in electricity of mining a block is higher than the value of that block.
If the price hovers so that mining is barely profitable, with the mining difficultly fluctuating because miners are being turned off. If the difficultly starts straddling profitable and not-profitable, this scenario as outlined could well happen even without a malicious actor.

You can greedy mine more than your fair share.
Imagine being 1 of 3. You all mine.

Diffulty adjusts to 2/3 previous value.
You all mine, you share 2016 3 ways in 9.3 days.
It ends up you get 1/6 of the share but contribute less than that in hashing power.

Please don't glee in suicide.
That said, when bitcoin dies it won't go to zero in price, the price will be remarkably stable relative to the health (it'll go down but not necessarily crash). What will happen is that liquidity will dry out, fewer buyers will be buying and sellers also will be fewer. It'll be a long slow process which hurts the longer it goes on, until eventually someone trying to sell to get out will realise there isn't anyone around left to buy.
Although the crashing could happen in short chunks if any institutions get out all at once, but chances are even the bitcoin friendly ones divested much of their holdings long ago.
This is the endgame, it was obvious from a year ago or more that bitcoin could not scale or more accurately would not.

I'm completely aware!
I'll be typing this up with better numbers in a blog article, but imagine two miners, A and B.
Both have same hash rate.
A + B mine for 2 weeks. Difficulty adjusts.
A then drops out.
B mines solo, takes 4 weeks but B gets 2016 blocks.
A rejoins.
A+B take 1 week they each get 1008 blocks.
A drops out.
B mines solo, takes 4 weeks, gets 2016 blocks.
Over a 5 week period, A mines 1 week gets 1008 blocks. B mines 5 weeks gets only 3 times that amount.
So the greedy miner hashes 1/6 of the hash rate and gets 1/4 the reward.
 
The trick is that a+b hash against the difficulty for just b, while b solo hashes the difficulty of a+b, so b has to pay for the difficulty that a adds to the pool.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:24:23
They don't get the same money/time.
They get the same money/block, but due to the higher difficulty and fewer people mining, the time for each block is increased.
When you're mining you are looking for a hash that is smaller than a number K.
How often that happens is dependent only on the difficulty, not at all on how many other people are mining.
If lots of people are mining they will get to each block quicker, but for a given length of time T, any one person isn't affected by others. (Until the difficulty changes.)

Chances are, you'd have rolled your early profits into buying more mining equipment, which even relatively early hasn't really been profitable. (If you compare to just buying BTC).

I have come up with the general formula though I am saving it for a blog article.
Critically you don't get "less" than half reward of mining all the time, you actually get exactly half reward compared to mining all the time but mine less than half the time.
This is really about the end game when electricity is the dominant cost, so mining efficiency (which this improves) is more important than hardware depreciation.
Imagine if the whole mining community split their hash rate alternately. (But cooperated to keep it stable). They'd all get the same reward but collectively spend half the energy.

Don't worry, I agree with this analysis too, you're not wrong.
In fact they get the same money/block (individual), the same money/time (individual), reduced block/time (network).
My original scenario is a situation where the "hard" blocks are unprofitable for a group but the easy blocks are profitable. I am concerned whether the difficulty algorithm is one that stablizes or de-stabilizes under a binary input. (Some algorithms smooth so they evventually smooth to the mean, others de-stabilize so they oscillate even further out than the inputs. - my energy company did this with their estimated readings, under one month, next month it double-corrected for what it saw as a big increase so was massively over, then massively under the next, etc. On this point I am still investigating what will happen to the real bitcoin algo.)

Fees will continue to increase.
For a "fee market" to evolve, there needs to be demand and suppliers. But there is only a fixed supply.
If fees get high, there's no way for miners to say, "Oh fees are high, we should mine more blocks or larger blocks to capture these fees". So fees continue to increase because demand is just slightly higher than capacity.
Anyone who has ever used the phrase "fee market" with respect to a fixed block size has no grasp of what is and will occur.

People keep referencing a 50% drop after halving as a "worst case" because they're imagining that once 50% drop out it must be as-profitable for the ones left in, but that's only true post-adjustment, as well described elsewhere it could be anywhere from 0 to 100% of miners suddenly fall below profitability and cease mining.
Also if post difficulty adjustment those miners all join back in, you get a feedback effect which doesn't get smoothed so you get a see-saw effect with short profitable runs and long slow unprofitable runs.
(This is why I believe that a fork to change difficulty adjustment is a good idea, it's something that I've been saying is a problem for a very long time.)

The whole spec in fact used to be under the control of w3c who wrote the HTML 4.1 spec, but delayed so long in writing a HTML 5 spec that a competing group the whatwg wrote their own "living standard" to capture what browsers were *actually* implementing.

But surely you don't need to upload it to all the peers you're connected with, since they'll themselves have interconnections.
If you upload it to a few, they'll start sharing it among themselves right?
Something seems really off with the design if every node needs the bandwidth to upload every block to every other node they peer with.
Edit: Put it this way, bitorrent was designed to reduce bandwidth requirements on single hosts. If N hosts need to download 1MB then you need N MB total bandwidth across the network.

Your transaction was 797 bytes, so you offered 12.5 satoshi/byte.
Maybe it was the going rate yesterday, but it's not the going rate today. And that's the problem with an ever increasing "fee market", without unlimited potential block size for the miners there's no free market to determine the price, just ever increasing fees required.
For some reason a lot of people here expect people to be able to know what a transaction size is in bytes and use that to determine the pricing, when transaction size (in bytes) doesn't even correlate that closely to transaction size (in money).

Miner's fees could get high enough to warrant mining more and that is a good point, although those fees would have to be quite dramatic to cover the current mining rewards, but it is possible it would get that high.
But the BTC available on exchanges isn't governed by what is transacted on the blockchain. Trade on an exchange is entirely off-blockchain, only btc denominated deposits/withdrawls would go through the blockchain.

What you are "seeing" here is just human psychology:
People don't like to place under-priced buy orders in a falling market, as they don't want to risk catching a falling knife, but also because they think they can get it cheaper by waiting.
People in a rallying market do like to place over-price sell orders because they think "if it just rallies to X I'll get out".
Psychology drives these orders to round numbers (because they are just driven by psychology / gambling).
If that's even what you were talking about, it's really not clear from your screenshot.
I'd suggest you take some fresh air, go for a walk and try to forget bitcoin for a while. It sounds like you've been staring at screens trying to get information which isn't there.
If this is a sign you are in over your head I'd also suggest trying to fix that, but I will not offer financial advice about how you do that.

It's true that in 1994 when this was published it wasn't a typical set-up. FWIW this was in the Des Moines register but I'm unfamiliar of how wealthy or not that audience was in 1994.
But in a few short years, by 1996/7 almost every computer (in Europe at least) was shipping with a modem. The advent of "winmodems" (i.e. the modem function could be handled by the main processor) and/or the ability to run a modem on the PCI/32 bus rather than separate dedicated hardware reduced the cost significantly.
But I think it's misleading to try to look at costs and compare them to now. A computer from then might be $4000+ if you plug it into an inflation calculator, but computers were also seem primarily as something that would help you be professional, not just dossing about looking at cat pictures on or gaming.
Computers are much much cheaper than they used to be, it was definitely an euthusiast and hobbyist thing back then rather than "everyone should have a computer".
But that changed so quickly. With the internet, and the web especially, it was easy to use and killed the "old" internet of BBS, usenet, etc. Compare emailing (literally a name with either compuserve (some hard to remember sequence of numbers) or having to directly dial their server and communicate directly using their own custom protocol. (protocol as in application layer, it would have still been tcp/ip).

Notice that for "by e-mail" the instructions are simple, just email dsmreg  The complicated instructions are for pre-cursors to the internet. For people NOT using internet service providers but instead direct dialing.
The internet solved problems, and did so effectively and efficiently. 
Secondly, this looks like it is before the web, i.e. the internet *hadn't* really even taken off compared to how it would later take off once a *killer app* was available. The invention of the web propelled the internet from curiousity to necessity in a short time.

That's the point, bitcoin is more like the hard method not the easy method. That's why I agree this is absolutely no reason to be bullish about bitcoin, it shows just how bad the UX of bitcoin is.
But you're wrong about email, it was easy. Compare it to what came before, the "instructions for direct dial" versus email.
And trust me, setting up your ISP while a little bit of configuration was still easy. You had a single number you had to enter and a single username/password. That's a world of difference to what came before, requiring you to individually dial to the service you wanted.

There are better ways to represent an address, but addresses have so much *entropy* there is no way to make them easy to remember. If an address was easy to remember, it would also be easy to generate an address collission.
Here's a recipe for converting an address to english words:
 Take any address. We can isntead encode with diceware.
But then you need to know which wordlist. Let's use the [eff large list](
Let's take the genesis block as an example address:
This is normally encoded (in base58) as 1A1zP1eP5QGefi2DMPTfTL5SLmv7DivfNa
In HEX this is 0062E907B15CBF27D5425399EBF6F0FB50EBB88F18C29B7D93.
Now we can take this stream of bytes and convert them to base7776.
Now the original bitstream is binary, we can either convert by bit or by byte. The highest power of 2 which is less than 6^5 = 7776, is 4096. log(4096)/log(2) = 12, so this is in fact 12 bits. This is actually a stroke of luck because we can represent 12 bits with exactly 3 hex digits without requiring padding or special handling.
So now we chop up the address in HEX into triplets:
006 2E9 07B 15C BF2 7D5 425 399 EBF 6F0 FB5 0EB B88 F18 C29 B7D 93
That last doesn't fit! We'll have to think about how to handle that. I'll show one way to handle that later.
For now, we can convert each of these hex triplets to base 6. For illustration I'll convert via the decimal, but it's not required.
Here's the same list (except the last entry) in decimal:
6 745 123 348 3058 2005 1061 921 3775 1776 4021 235 2952 3864 3113 2941
Now we can convert each of those numbers into diceware by converting to base 6 and adding 1 (because dice are 1-6 not 0-5!).
For example for 745 we need to find the solution to a.6^4 + b.6^3+c.6^2+d.6^1+e.6^0 which will give the number abcde as read in base 6. Fortunately we can use a spreadsheet or program.
In base 6, those numbers now are represented as:
We can add 1 to each digit to make them dice-list compatible:
These can now be read from the diceware list:
But we're missing a word. How do we deal with the last 2 hanging digits?
Well we could "just" append a 0, but that gets ambiguous.
Instead we can observe that we have a lot of words left unused in our list. Because our triplets can only be one of 4096 values, we only use words up to 41655 which is national.
So we've got words from native to zoom we can use.
So what's the easiest way? Well we only need another 256 values because we only have 2 hex digits, so the simplest thing to do is to simply subtract from 7775 to make sure we're using the end of the list.
So for our value 93 here, remember this is hex so is actually 9*16+3 = 147 in decimal. (In many systems it'll actually be treated as 9 + 3*16 = 57 because of what is known as endianness but I won't get into that here).
This is then subtracted from 7775. (It's 7775, because we allow zero, so we have 7776 different numbers).
7775 - 147 = 7628
Converted to "diceware" (base 6 + 1) this is 66263, perhaps appropriately *whoops*.
So our final diceware EFF rememberable address is:
    ablaze bullhorn almanac atrium gully drone citric caucasian mower antirust grab margin gopher whoops
The lack of google results suggests that I've made an error in my calculations somewhere, as I can't believe this hasn't been done before, I suspect that my sloppy handling of endianness has maybe caused that.
Anyway, that's one way to try to make an address memorable.
But it still sucks, there's just too much randomness. Can you really remember the differnce between that and `ablaze bullhorn almanac atrium gully drone citric caucus mower antirust grab margin gopher whoops` because one mistake and you can't send money. (Thankfully it doesn't go to the wrong place, Satoshi was smart enough that there's a checksum in addresses, so if you slip up you can't send money).
Any approach is doomed because any result still has 160 bits of entropy, and 160 bits is too much to reliably remember. It's appropriate to maybe remember a single dicephrase that length as a master password for a password vault, it's not appropriate to need to remember that much entropy for anyone to whom you want to transfer money.

Sure, but pine was awkward only because it was a terminal client, you wouldn't use it in a windowing environment, you'd use eudora (or later outlook express or thunderbird) instead.
Do you think dialing up was hard? It wasn't hard, it's just what you *did* back then.
This article is from 1994, I was mistaken thinking it was earlier than it was only because those "direct computer" instructions sound quite dated even for that time. Perhaps because Europe didn't have much "online service provider" presence or history of having modems in the pre-internet that once ISPs sprang up in 1992/3 that exploded everywhere and we dind't have a transition from online service providers\* to ISPs we just went straight from nothing to ISPs.
\* Providers such as AOL or Compuserve before they were ISPs had online services which weren't the open internet. It's tricky to explain but I'm sure you understand.

You don't need front running, just a bad matching algo.
Imagine you offer to buy at 230. I come along and offer to sell at 220.
A good exchange will match oldest and settle at 230.
A bad exchange will settle the buy at 230 and the sell at 220 and pocket the 10 from the spread.
This requires no grot running and I'm fairly sure some BTc exchanges have done this in the past. Both sides appear to get what by want so it is hard to detect.

You're right that SMTP is still around, that's because it's the easy email method mentioned above. It's so easy in fact that nothing has been able to effectively replace it. There have been a few updates and modernisations, but it's fundamentally the same protocol. But that's the application layer.
Also, you're not making the user type HELO, RECV, etc, the user experience is totally different, and that's the point being made.
As an aisde, connecting to a server with an internet service provider is very different to directly dialing and entering the commands via something like telnet or netcat.
If the internet still worked by individually dialling or manually connecting to different services, without any nameservers, and then having to manually communicate through the protocols by hand, which is effectively the instructions outlined above, it would not have the UX required to fully take off.
It would still be popular by some hobbyists of course, as the proto-internet was, but it did not take off until there was a good user experience on what was fundamentally a different system when looked at as a whole.
Lastly, as this really is an aside since it's about the application layer, the vast majority of email doesn't even go via SMTP anymore. Two people communicating via gmail and those messages aren't going around the network via the SMTP protocol, they'll have their own internal system. And while it's not documented anywhere, I really doubt hotmail and gmail are exchanging via calls to SMTP or POP3 servers, I expect they have a private protocol for mass exchange of emails.
If I've made technical mistakes then please correct me but also please be aware you've missed my point. This is a UX (user experience) thing, not a technical thing.

See, this is why I've never recommended bitcoin.
You say that you "[wouldn't] recommend bitcoin to anyone in its present state", but that state is the exact state it has been in the past when you were buying and recommending it, you just couldn't see it then.
This is why I've stayed clear of bitcoin and haven't bought any, because it turns out that it was the bitcoin community who were shortsighted in the past, and likely will be again.
People have for years made analysis about blocksizes and transaction speeds, transaction capacity and costs, but in the past they were always downvoted and told not to worry about it.
Now the bitcoin community has finally caught up with what they were warning about, and they're not liking what they see.

There's a classic "[auction a dollar](  thought experiment, or you can look at footballers salaries. By paying a little more you'll scoop all the prizes/tv revenue, until eventually you're actually paying more than those prizes are worth, but you'll be even worse off if you don't continue upping the ante, because you'll still be paying 90% of the cost but with far less of the reward.

It's also one of the most protracted in terms of decline.
The post-gox bubble bursting was fascinating, but it was clear for months before it went belly up that mtgox wasn't doing legit market settling.
Then we had a month where you couldn't actually withdraw USD from mtgox, so if you wanted out you had to buy BTC and withdraw that. That meant the price could only really go one-way.
Add to that no derivatives, so no way to short and it was a bubble that only went belly up because gox bankrupt themselves seemingly trying to cover over a previous mistake of getting 'hacked'.
That was the "tech" bubble, in other words when bitcoin went from talked about on tech forums to being all over the tech press, but not really all over mainstream news.
This bubble though? This bubble is a tether-induced "mainstream" bubble, where this time the increasing price led to being all over *mainstream* news. That combined with tether printing money.
It even looks like maybe tether was used to try to soften the blow which has caused a year long deflating process.
Who knows what the market will look like when tether is unwound back to zero cap.
Is there another audience for another new bubble once the dust has settled and something else is causing price increases?
Maybe next bubble will be the "institutional" bubble, but regulations exist to try to stop that happening. No-one wants pension funds FOMOing into bitcoin.

I've corrected "side chain" to "side ledger" in the original for clarity. I guess it comes down to how do you define side-ledger.
A ledger *is* a list of transactions. That they're kept "to the side" and not broadcast is what a side-ledger is.
You're literally keeping a separate private ledger between the participating parties.

I've also been here since 2012 but I can't agree with you on lightning, it's a bad kludge which has a bad user flow. 
Tying up money to transfer other money, needing to maintain online presence, and worst of all, it's just a side-ledger, so by definition it dilutes the idea of a global distributed trusted ledger.
It's a part-trusted side-ledger. If that's what you want, that doesn't even need any on-chain presence to handle. Lightning is a fudge to pretend that it's on-chain and has most of the downsides of both worlds.

There aren't billions, there are billions of billions of billions of ... of billions.  I know the website, it's a form of mathematical joke. The joke is that it is trivial to define the list of every key but impossible to enumerate any non - trivial portion.
It's not a statistical anomaly. You haven't actually defined what you meant by "in use" either, sounds like you basically picked a few from the first page to generate yourself a wallet, so you basically just created a very unsecured wallet using one of the worst sources of randomness. If there were no transactions against those addresses then they're not "in use".
Perhaps others are as ignorant as you and did the same and imported these ultra week addresses then didn't remove them and ended up using them, more fool them I guess. It's not a statistical anomaly though, a hash collision of the bitcoin address would be world news.
Edit: the bitcoin address is a ripemd-160 hash of a sha256 hash, neither of which have ever had any hash collisions reported.  Or if you're claiming that you've got 2 private keys with the same public key (unhashed match) then you've broken ECDSA which would be interesting enough to warrant publication.
I guess "user decides to skip randomization when generating private keys, others have done the same" is less ground breaking.  I'm not trying to deny your experience, just pointing out it wasn't a statistical anomaly at work.

Picking random number from a list is iterating through a sequence, it is analogous to shuffling the set then iterating sequentially.
And it's the same as generating pure random bytes given the set was the complete set.
By claiming to have found a private key which hashed to a an address in use, you are claiming to have found a clash in the hashing algorithm, which is a extraordinary claim.
Or you've randomly chosen the same private key which is an even a harder claim.

No, you're just lying.

You're claiming you did it in a few dozen checks.  Even with a few billion attempts it is less likely than picking the correct grain of sand from a beach.  There is zero chance what you are saying is true.
