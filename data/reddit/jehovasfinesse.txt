I’m about to start in Bitcoin. Are you saying the everyday laptop I use, and no one else touches is not safe to use for Bitcoin ? I don’t want to invest in a hardware wallet yet, might do so once the verdict on the legality of bitcoin in India is decided. How should I secure my laptop / PC  then?
Do you not keep anything on your PC?

Never happened before, but I guess no point going back and forth on this.

Is it safe? Doesn’t that require a level of trust in a stranger that is naive? 
I’ll look into it though. Might just work if they have an iron clad escrow contract or something else that allows for zero trust transactions.

No ATMs. One opened and closed within a week a few states away and the owner was jailed. I have a friend who tried localcoinswap but said there were literally no people in our area. 
We have non crypto wallets like Paytm, HDFC payzapp, Mobikwik, Airtel Money, etc. Is there a way I can transfer money to this wallet and then use it to transfer to some other wallet/account and make it so that it isn’t flagged as being associated with crypto(Like doing multiple steps to distance myself from the flaggable wallets/electronic transaction I initially made?
Or any other way if you can think of it

Man your links in the post are all messed up. 
Bisq leads to localcoinswap, localcoinswap leads to lightning, lightning leads to something else...

I doubt it will ever go to zero.

I’m just starting out so bear with me..
So what wallet do you use? Any recommendations for someone from India?
The banks are closing down accounts that associate with crypto wallets
How do I start buying BTC if I can’t buy them using money from my account?

Hopefully the small batches don’t lead to me becoming a mark for a long con

The mirror works. But what I said was -your hyperlinks are incorrectly linked. Perhaps your brain has a crack in it if you become this hostile to some criticism.
Regardless, I appreciate the work you have put into the extensive list you’ve created.

Mate I can’t afford two systems where I’m basically not using one system at all coz all my work/play involves internet.
Plus I don’t know squat about using Linux, let alone downloading a good copy, installing correctly and protecting it against malware in case a flash drive/HDD I hook up to it has malware.
And I’m not a trader. I just want to buy Bitcoin, this week, and three more times before the halvening at whatever lows I think are worth it and then store them for at least 5-20 years based on the legitimacy / value of bitcoin and my ability to cash out based on the laws in my country. So an entire system for like 4 singular events would be impractical for me right?
India- in case that’s important.

Aren’t hardware wallets and cold storage the same ?
Also, should I use my iPhone 7 with prepaid SIM In India over my MacBook Pro with no antivirus/windows machine?
