so even though the bitcoin and litecoin blockchains are completely separate, they can sort of interact with each other and tie two set amounts together? Do I get the alt coin from a person or directly from the chain?
Say I want 1 btc of litecoin. What do I need to do to use a side chain. Can you explain the process please?

so whats stopping somebody from sidechaining bitcoin to litecoin, then back from litecoin to bitcoin, and back to bitcoin and just depleting the entire chain on both ends?
@_date: 2014-04-25 05:54:27
The reason why, is because the "printing" (mining) of bitcoins is slowing down. Eventually it will stop when it reaches 21 million. The Fed has no plan to stop.

@_date: 2014-06-18 01:38:25
but does it *really* make them more valuable? 
How much value did that 2,130 burn give the rest? If someone can give me a solid number on that, then I will believe that lost/burned coins have a positive affect on the rest of the bitcoins. But until then, it just appears some of the coins are sitting inside an unbreakable safe on the blockchain. 
The only thing I can think of is, that since those missing coins aren't in circulation, we are meta-physically trading fewer coins. And if I really want some, and there aren't enough to go around, i'll pay a little more to make sure I get some. But I really don't know how accurate that is.

What happens if all the coins are mined and people/exchange owned or dormant on an alt chain you want to convert to? are you able to get some, or this works only for unmined coins?
When you burn them back to Bitcoin, do they go back into the block chain to be mined?
Would it be possible for someone to create an alt coin and side chain into bitcoin and nab up ALL the unmined coins? Even in a legitimate way?
Last question, say I sidechain my bitcoin into litecoin. What determines the exchange ratio?

she had no idea. Eventually she just said you need to pull up your bank app and it should work. My credit union's app doesn't have an NFC pay option. I asked her if she could figure out/email somebody and find what the consumer side needs in order for us to complete the order when I come in next time. to be honest though, I don't think my GS3 even has NFC capabilities. 
Eventually she got frustrated with me. I swiped my debit card left. But i go there a couple times a week and they all know my face. But i want to start paying with my phone!  Get on your game Mickey D's...

I was under the impression that the bitcoins were permanently destroyed. I was thinking, sure some lossage of coins would make others more valuable, but what happens when 20 million are lost and completely gone? The price would be so high, I don't think bitcoin would be a viable currency and since so many were gone, its use as a store of value would be questioned immensely.  
But again I was under wrong impressions. The bitcoins are not destroyed and can be reused once the altcoin is burned. Super interesting concept.

I think its based on individual exchanges. When the exchanges coffers start filling up with bitcoins, the price goes down. and when it starts to run thin, the price rises again. 
and if bitcoin is cheaper at a differnt exchange, they'll go there to buy it and raise the price until it evens with everyone else. 
only exception to this is Mt. Gox, and I think we all know what happened there. 
And the overall price is just a medium of all the exchanges.

People so flippantly put their cash into banks thinking its safe and secure and nothing could ever go wrong. (as long as we keep bailing out banks). But eventually when people do make that bank run and the physical fiat banks close up shop... Oooo weee, regular people are really gonna lose their shit. 
meanwhile, bitcoiners will have hopefully learned their lesson with Mt. Gox and hopefully only lost a small amount if any at all. And will secure their money on their own.

My only problem with people smashing iPhones, is that it helps Apple. Apple doesn't want people reselling devices. Smashing them ensures that. 
That means when some clueless person goes out to buy their first smart phone, instead of getting a used iPhone on the second hand market for cheap, they will then need to go buy a new iPhone giving profits to apple. 
Give your iphones away for free to the homeless. Don't smash them.

**Bayesian probability** is one of the different interpretations of the concept of probability and belongs to the category of evidential probabilities. The Bayesian interpretation of probability can be seen as an extension of propositional logic that enables reasoning with propositions whose truth or falsity is uncertain. To evaluate the probability of a hypothesis, the Bayesian probabilist specifies some prior probability, which is then updated in the light of new, relevant data.[1]
The Bayesian interpretation provides a standard set of procedures and formulae to perform this calculation. In contrast to interpreting probability as the "frequency" or "propensity" of some phenomenon, Bayesian probability is "a quantity that we assign theoretically, for the purpose of representing a state of knowledge".[2]
The term "Bayesian" refers to the 18th century mathematician and theologian Thomas Bayes, who provided the first mathematical treatment of a non-trivial problem of Bayesian inference.[3] Nevertheless, it was the French mathematician Pierre-Simon Laplace who pioneered and popularised what is now called Bayesian probability.[4]
Broadly speaking, there are two views on Bayesian probability that interpret the probability concept in different ways. According to the objectivist view, the rules of Bayesian statistics can be justified by requirements of rationality and consistency and interpreted as an extension of logic.[2][5] According to the subjectivist view, probability quantifies a "personal belief".[6] Many modern machine learning methods are based on objectivist Bayesian principles.[7] In the Bayesian view, a probability is assigned to a hypothesis, whereas under the frequentist view, a hypothesis is typically tested without being assigned a probability.

I think most people look at their storage of bitcoin and tend not to spend it because they will have less overall. But with this feature, you can spend out of your coinbase wallet and immediately refill it so you can keep a steady amount.  Its a psychological thing. Because every time they spend bitcoin, they can just buy the same amount. This just stream lines the process.

Then people would have backed off of her. But she is sticking to her guns and her evidence is so off kilter its unbelievable. He said he is no longer involved is her evidence.

But with that said, for me its always time to buy. Just like you, I have recurring buys on coinbase. I have mine set to buy every friday. And if I feel like I can put another $10 or $15 into savings that week I buy just a little bit more. 
I believe in bitcoin that every time I see it fall I just see bitcoins at a discount. I know it will go back up eventually as the world catches on and it seems like its really about to hit traction right now. 
If you wait for it to dip before you buy, you will miss out in my opinion. I remember looking at them when they were @ $200 (8 months ago) and thinking... hmmm... I don't know. Imagine what we will think of the $600 price 5 years from now?

I'll tell you why you think its suicidal. Because of the price fluctuations. Large price movements could be disastrous for small businesses. 
Thats my point why I said it needs a gigantic market cap. The bigger the cap, the less the price will move and the more stable it will be. Giving even more confidence to people who are on the fence about using bitcoin. 
And from now til forever, accepting bitcoin doesn't mean you have to hold in bitcoin. You can accept bitcoin and convert it to Fiat at time of purchase.

This is not a failure of bitcoin. This is a failure of people/business. 
The only reason why mt. gox was able to steal the coins, is because the people put their bitcoins into mt. gox like it was a bank. And then that bank closed its doors. 
I didn't lose a single golden satoshi, why? because I kept my bitcoin safe with me. I didn't give it to some corporation to hold for me.

Everyone loves crypto currencies because of the pumps. I also love it for its libertarian uses. And I think this is the closest thing to Banking reform we'll ever get.  
Bill says he likes it because its more secure and faster than bitcoin. Not because its being pumped. 
go here and check out the volumes.    
Bitcoin has the most volume. But thats mostly because you can't buy any other crypto with fiat, you got to use bitcoin to get alt coins. 
Quark has the second most volume, almost twice what litecoin has. People are trading it. Quark trumps almost all other alt coins by a huge margin. I really don't know what to say about dogecoin besides that the 4chan'ers are probably pumping it amongst themselves because they think its funny or something. These are the same people who put pedobear decals on their cars... **rollseyes**
Quark is going to be a main contender, even if people don't want anything besides Bitcoin. Sorry, but the market isn't small enough for just one Crypto.

They've been spying on us very discreetly for the last 10 years minimum(probably closer to 40 years) without us realizing. Sure people knew and they tried to warn us, but we called them conspiracy theorist and nut jobs and they hired mel gibson to make [a movie to ridicule and mock Conspiracy believers](
Anyone who thought 9/11 was an inside job was smeared for even asking questions. [Either you're with us, or you're with the terrorist]( 
Them putting handsome men in front of us and call them a President, doesn't fool me. But I think its fooled most of us for a long time. I think we don't give them the credit they deserve. Its hard running a shadow gov't. Keeping projects out of the sight of the public. Think about area 51. Theres a reason its top secret. They're doing shit in there and they don't want know one to know. What the heck is going on in there?? You don't know either so don't pretend like you do know. 
I'm just saying. There are reasons why we always see certain political actors for a while then they go away. They are just playing their part for the dark part of the gov't to run in secret. Look at the actors. Hilary clinton. John Kerry. Mccain. Chris christy has finally been vetted enough to where he is going to start getting his time in the light and demand the attention of the masses. Secret gov't is Secret. spying and information is key to world domination. Gotta keep Iran out of the major action otherwise harder problems for dark gov't. 
You saying they couldn't devise a plan monopolize non-counterfeitable digital currency. You know they been reading our emails about us hating on the fed.  
I like to think this is their way to give back to the american people for selling us as debt slaves to the god damn rothschild banksters and the IMF.  They gave it to the libertarians first. Because we knew what was fucking up. Now, just as the chinese are starting to take what is rightfully american, Now they got to push it on the conservatives. [Exhibit A: Whats less conservative than a Kentucky Police Cheif]( LOL

I'm a libertarian type, i believe in btc, i also believe the NSA has more than just a toe in this. Possibly waist deep as we all are starting to jump on board. I'm sure they can somehow link your bitcoin address to an IP you are using. Thats enough info to gather without the need of consent and if they want to know who you are, a warrant to the ISP is pretty easily obtainable. 
Imagine if the warrant was for seisure of all computers in the house. They could make your life a living hell. Better make sure those wallets are encrypted. They just might feel the need to transfer your coins to their purse for safe keeping until after your trial of tax evasion.

i buy gift cards using the gyft app with bitcoins. Buy target cards and get 3% back with bitcoin. I then buy the amount of bitcoin I spent on the gift card. 
if i could get a real grocery store (target has some groceries but not much) and a gas card with the gyft app, I'd seriously consider converting my whole check to bitcoin every two weeks.

One crypto is not enough. It just isn't. especially bitcoin. People need  backup currencies. 
I'm ALL in on bitcoin, I love it and I am the biggest endorser of it out of anyone I know. But it has problems. That is a given being the first one out of the gate. Even though bitcoin looks like a Tesla Roadster, given enough time it will look like the Model T of crypto currencies.
Your argument is like saying there isn't enough room for both Apple computers, Windows, linux or ubuntu. So the others should just go away and we can all be on Macs and be happy. 
Competition is always good, what happens if in the future a major break through happens and the bitcoin cryptology becomes very easy to break? (I don't think this will happen soon) but if bitcoin holds a percentage of the worlds wealth and only bitcoin exist, then we have a MAJOR problem.  There needs to be several competing cryptos out there. 
I think the biggest downside to new cryptos is the same downside Big Banks see when looking at bitcoin. And that is, "nooo... these other currencies are going to take away from my currency of choice." Its greed when we don't want competition. 
So if litecoin or quark take off, then maybe Bitcoin won't be worth 1 million dollars each one day. And that IS okay. Bitcoin may only be worth $50k max because of competing currencies, thats okay! 
The way I imagine the seamless conversion of currencies is there needs to be big decentralized pools of currencies. A place you can go and trade your currency of choice for another without giving it to another person.  Imagine a protocol similar to bitcoin. Decentralized, running on everyone's computers. And in this protocol there is a million bitcoins, litecoins, quarkcoins and if you want a currency to be taken seriously the developers must give a certain amount of their coin to this pool. 
This pool will allow me to drop off 20 Litecoins and receive the same dollar amount of bitcoins or any other crypto currency without actually trading it with someone. 
So If I go into a pornshop(for example) and they only take sexcoins as payment, the app would take my bitcoin, drop them off in the decentralized pool and pull out that amount of sexcoins and I can then pay the shopkeep with sexcoins. Seamless massive integration of all legitimate crypto currencies.

So backing up your wallet on a thumb flash drive is a pretty good idea then? 
Quick question. Say I back up my wallet on a thumb drive. unplug it. sell my bit coins off my hard drive wallet and then plug in my flash drive with my older wallet theoretically containing the old addresses? Or do the addresses become obsolete when I trade my bit coins? 
Thank you!
I just saw your answer below. I'll post it below my question for others.

I had an idea for a fun smart phone app. You can have the idea for free if you develop it.  My idea was basically an app that you would type in the amount of bitcoins you own and the app would pull the price from an exchange. From there the app would visualize your coins. 
you could set which denomination you want to see it at. If you own one whole bitcoin it will show you one whole bitcoin. Fractions of a bitcoin can look like a small gold flake and the more you accumulate it could grow/form into a rough nugget then around 80% it will look like a rough unpolished copper colored coin and 1 bitcoin will look like a nice shiny Bitcoin.
Then you set the denomination into mBTC and now the one bitcoin shatters into a thousand whole bitcoins in a wheel barrow or a sack of coins.
Set the denomination into uBTC and that divides into a million coins that you can fill a large vault with.
Set it to show you the visualization in Satoshis and now you are scrooge mcduck swimming in coins. haha. I figured this would be a semi easy app to develop if one could get the current price from an exchange like Mt. Gox. Something fun people could show others. Cuz lets face it, saying I have a bitcoin to someone who doesn't understand bitcoins its like saying I own real estate on Mars. :D

I feel the same way. bitcoin will not topple the dollar but be used side by side like how gold coins are.
China and Russia are going to stop stockpiling the US dollar. 
Russia wants to be completely rid of the currency by 2017. 
China right now imports more oil than America and is currently setting up to price oil in Yuan.
Look up BRIC, Brazil Russia, India and China. They plan on taking their ball and not letting us play with it. They will take billions out of our economy. And some say by 2027 they could be doing more business than the G7 countries. 
China has kept the Yuan artificially low for a long time. As soon as they demand to buy oil in Yuan and force oil exporters to sell oil in Yuan, they will hike up the value, the oil exporters will see their Yuan purchasing power increase tremendously and America will look like a joke until we start bombing Arabs for betraying us. 
China is already swinging their big dicks around, and we American's are swinging our right back hoping to intimidate the chinese with our large african american dongs. Case in point:
oh yeah bitches??

Doesn't matter. Bitcoins are divisible. And if it really becomes the problem you are suggesting, they can set the decimal over a few more spots and create more units of trade with the same amount of overall bitcoins.

Honestly it probably doesn't matter at all to call the bitcoin by anything other than a bitcoin. Everything is priced in dollars. Nothing is priced in bitcoin. The bitcoin wallets on our phone should allow everyone to type the price in USD and spit out the exact amount of bitcoin to be spent. The numbers will get smaller and smaller and if you want to move the decimal over to see the exact amount of bitcoin to be bartered, than cool. 
whoa. It just dawned on me while typing this. A Real bitcoin is actually a satoshi. What we call a whole bitcoin nowadays is actually a 100 Million bitcoins. There arn't 21 million bitcoins, there are 2.1 quadrillion bitcoins.
This would be much easier for everyone to understand. Right now(11/20/13) a Million bitcoins is going for roughly $630 dollars. "whoa, I can get a 100 million bitcoins for 630 bucks? How much can I get for a thousand? Sign me up" lol.  
If you explain about mining and how there will only be 2.1 quadrillion units ever, and currently about 1Q are already out in the wild waiting to be bought and sold and traded. 
$1 is worth 158,730.00 bitcoins(satoshi) and one day a dollar could be worth 10,000 bitcoin, and the world is offering a 100 million bitcoins at $630 right now. We should call 100 million bitcoins($630) a satoshi. 
Does this make sense or am I too high?

No. You would get one token for each vote. Doesn't matter how rich or poor you are. As long as you pay federal Taxes, you get to vote. Don't pay taxes, don't get to vote. 
As for the elderly, since they have put in their fair share and receive social security, they will get their tokens with their ss checks.
The secret ballot really isn't secret. Infact because of the electoral, our votes truly don't even matter. If you live in a republican or democrat state, it really doesn't matter how hard you vote for the other guy, those two A-holes are going to vote their way. 
For the unemployed, if you are registered for unemployment, maybe you can have a vote. Because there are requirments to being on unemployment, like you have to submit list of employers you have given resumes/submitted applications to. idk. I'm not an expert, and I just thought of this last night. I won't have all the answers, but in my head its simple. You don't pay taxes, you don't vote. Old people get to vote, sick/disability people get to work as long as they are sick and not scamming the system. One vote per person. The gov't will hand out the Token Wallets and tokens. 
I'm sure Fox news will pull dirty tricks like, "scan this QR code for this candidate and this QR code for the other candidate."   The next night, "we are sorry there was  a technical problem and we accidentally gave you the QR code for only the republican candidate. Please be sure to check the address before sending vote tokens" *fox rubs hands together evilly*

People in this sub are extreamly close minded. Which is weird because they believe in bitcoin. But the fact is, if you show them a beautiful competitive horse, they will shit all over it to make their horse(bitcoin) look better. 
They lack confidence that bitcoin will survive with competition. What they fail to see is how BIG the market is. If you took American debt alone(and remember the Japanese have twice the debt america has) and you put just a fraction of it into bitcoin, bitcoin would be HUGE. There is enough market for probably 10 huge cryptos, but people in this sub don't want to hear about their horse running alongside 9 other horses. Bunch of cry babies.

but you know what I mean. Look at bitcoin in the last 30 days. $200 to $1200 where it took the last 4 years to go from nothing to $200. By this time next year, they will be $10,000 each. And a year from that $100,000 each and a little after that is when the expected Dollar crash will happen.

So the coin card(I have one preordered) has an app linked to the card. They would just need to link some wallet software to it and bam. 
But the real question is, if the bitcoin is right there in your phone and you transfer it through a QR code, why do you need to physically hand them anything at all? 
The real beauty will be when receipts come with QR code addresses requesting the bitcoin amount on them. Scan it, send it, done.

I'm confused. If people are selling, that means someone else is buying.  So how does the market determine if they are being sold or bought? Since cash transactions cant be quantified of a minus or a gain in value, is it all just based on the electric transfers from banks?
@_date: 2013-12-13 18:16:24
Don't worry about all the competing currencies. Soon enough there will be wallet apps that can store multiple currencies. Go to a store and when you pay find out what they accept, "oh you accept Bitcoin and litecoin?" 
Then seemlessly through the wallet app, you will convert your Quarkcoin, feathercoin, megacoin or worldcoin or whatevercoin into bitcoin and transfer the money to the vendor. 
I basically see it like: Oh, you only accept bitcoin, no problem. I'll send you $50 worth of bitcoin that the app will convert my feathercoin from.

I once had a jealous boyfriend of a girl I know(i'm male) come to my house and smash in my front door at 3:30am. The conflict began on facebook. A few days later he said he was coming back to my house and I called the cops and begged them to show up. When they arrived and I told them how it started on facebook, they laughed at me and said thats what I get for being on facebook. 
I gave the lady cop such a dirty look for her complete ignorance that facebook is just a new line of communication. Thats like me telling someone, you shouldn't use a phone because you could upset someone on the other side. You shouldn't write emails because the other person might not understand the tone of the conversation. You shouldn't mail letters because someone might not read into what you are saying correctly.

In order to do what you are saying, you'd have to inflate the money pool. And thats the REAL value of bitcoins, they can't be artificially inflated. There will be inflation, as only half of all the possible BTC that can exist have been mined, but people say it will take 30 years for the other 10 million bitcoins to come into existence. 
Thats the problem with our current money policy. Our money masters have inflated our money pool SO MUCH, that they keep moving the decimal to the left so we don't have to use thousands of bills to pay for a loaf of bread.

YES!! As I Said in another thread


China has just barred financial institutions(for the moment) to not deal in bitcoin in any way, shape, or form.
Did China just make sure that the people get first dibs on bitcoin before it unleashes the financial markets on bitcoin. 


China is the Hero of the World! I think I may become a marxist.
Remember people, the gov'ts of the world have unknowningly sold us as debt slaves to the banks. I (metophroically) pray that this is the gov't's attempt at saying sorry to its people and allowing the people to benefit the most from bitcoin before financial institutions grab it all up and drive up the prices. 
Today is the time to buy!! Time to make a run on the banks! Exchange your worthless fiat currency for a real digital commodity!

uBTC at current price(roughly) 1600 ubtc is a $1. 
My 60,000 ubtc is worth about $37, imagine trying to do that math at a store. I know you don't have to pull out a pen and paper and do the math, but still.  Its needs to be easier to understand for dummies like me.

The market would drop and hungry investors will swarm it like a blood thirsty pack of Piranhas driving the price right back up. And once that whale has dumped his bitcoins he will no longer be able to change the market at will.

Then can I make one suggestion? Allow me to take a screen shot of my QR code again. 
Thats how I was doing it before. It would show my QR code and I would screen grab it, then I could transfer the photo to my offline storage. But with the newest update, you guys disabled screen grabbing. 
Since I can't get to my keys without putting in my pin number, I shouldn't worry about someone screen grabbing my QR code without my permission. Unless of course a malicious app is just sitting on my phone waiting to screen grab important info. 
Can you explain the reason for disabling screen grabs?

The typhoon annihilated infrastructure. There is no water or electricity or buildings anymore. There are still parts of the Philippines that are completely cut off. There are no roads. There is no food, and the telecom infrastructure is still at ~50% even as aid agencies and nation-states scramble just to figure out what the damage even is.
Bitcoins depend on the existence of electrical and network infrastructure, and those things are fucking gone.
How the fuck are people currently scavenging through the rubble of civilization supposed to make use of those bitcoins?
How is somebody living underneath a propped-up sheet of corrugated metal and with literally nothing left to their name supposed to convert your bitcoins to something that they can actually spend to keep themselves alive?
Is that how your brain works? Instead of trying to think of ways to help, you think only negatively about how things aren't possible anymore? 
You don't think help is on the way? People will be evacuated. With nothing to their name. But as soon as they are stable ground, people with family out of country will be able to send them money immediately so there is a chance they won't be homeless in a foreign place. Lets see how this pans out.

If wishes were horses we'd all be eating steak tonight. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:10:07
The problem is everyone is greedy. They want the horse they chose to win. 
They think, "well, I invested $2500 into bitcoin. If this goes to a million dollars each, than wow, I'll be rich. Oh no, what is this Litecoin and Quarkcoin? These may prevent bitcoin from going to a million dollars each, I better vehemently deny them."
I just posted this in another thread:


Then seemlessly through the wallet app, you will convert your Quarkcoin, feathercoin, megacoin or worldcoin or whatevercoin into bitcoin and transfer the money to the vendor.
I basically see it like: Oh, you only accept bitcoin, no problem. I'll send you $50 worth of bitcoin that the app will convert my feathercoin from.


I'm ALL in on bitcoin, I love it and I am the biggest endorser of it out of anyone I know. But it has problems. That is a given being the first one out of the gate. Even though bitcoin looks like a Tesla Roadster, given enough time it will look like the Model T of crypto currencies.
Your argument is like saying there isn't enough room for both Apple computers, Windows, linux or ubuntu. So the others should just go away and we can all be on Macs and be happy.
Competition is always good, what happens if in the future a major break through happens and the bitcoin cryptology becomes very easy to break? (I don't think this will happen soon) but if bitcoin holds a percentage of the worlds wealth and only bitcoin exist, then we have a MAJOR problem. There needs to be several competing cryptos out there.
I think the biggest downside to new cryptos is the same downside Big Banks see when looking at bitcoin. And that is, "nooo... these other currencies are going to take away from my currency of choice." Its greed when we don't want competition.
So if litecoin or quark take off, then maybe Bitcoin won't be worth 1 million dollars each one day. And that IS okay. Bitcoin may only be worth $50k max because of competing currencies, thats okay!
The way I imagine the seamless conversion of currencies is there needs to be big decentralized pools of currencies. A place you can go and trade your currency of choice for another without giving it to another person. Imagine a protocol similar to bitcoin. Decentralized, running on everyone's computers. And in this protocol there is a million bitcoins, litecoins, quarkcoins and if you want a currency to be taken seriously the developers must give a certain amount of their coin to this pool.
This pool will allow me to drop off 20 Litecoins and receive the same dollar amount of bitcoins or any other crypto currency without actually trading it with someone.
So If I go into a pornshop(for example) and they only take sexcoins as payment, the app would take my bitcoin, drop them off in the decentralized pool and pull out that amount of sexcoins and I can then pay the shopkeep with sexcoins. Seamless massive integration of all legitimate crypto currencies.
