I have been very critical to how Bitfinex has handled this (should obviously have hired better security experts), but this is the best solution I could think of. I assume that we will somehow be able to verify the books and that Bitfinex has put in what they can (less operation cost for ~1-2 years). A lawsuit would end in a worse deal for everybody.

What obviously need to happen right now is for Bitfinex to declare how much BTC they have left. That should have been done two days ago. There is no reason at all not to make that public. Furthermore; how will we know that whales do not get a better deal than normal customers? What law enforcement are you working with? There are a lot of questions that has been ignored that you need to address. Your customers deserves full transparency. @_date: 2016-08-05 18:15:55
Everyone does not like He ignores almost every important question. This is how PR usually work, however, so from Bitfinex point of view, he is doing just fine. It's just that he is doing very little to address customers concerns.

By "bullshit-opinion", I guess you mean an opinion not grounded in logic and facts?

To mine is to cast a vote. ROI on mining alone does not equal total ROI in Bitcoin.

Two of the authors of the cited papers in the white paper are strong Core-supporters (Nick and Adam). One of which is most likely Satoshi. It does not matter, however. Evidence and science should not have authorities. The only thing it does is debunk the "Satoshi"-vision of unlimited resources, which is frequently used by bullshiters.

I agree and I do believe you have a point. In this case, however, I'm the miner. I mine to show the market my stand point (however small footprint it may be), not to ROI on mining alone but to see Bitcoin evolve into what I believe is the best version of Bitcoin. Incentives are not always monetary.

The toolchain is not Visual Studio. .NET Core is absolutely not a second class citizen.
