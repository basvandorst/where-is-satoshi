It Doesn't but some recent BBC video claimed they did - based on some ISIS supporter blog, now its owner says it was false. That was the point.

It was published in a BBC article few days ago and few months ago By sky news both of them quoting the same source we debunked now in this article.

SR2 isn't close by a long shot,  especially in the "trustworthy" measure, the only close thing between the two markets is the logo image and the CSS.

Thanks!  &amp; Did a great AMA there.

That's a good question from what i have learned so far the answer is something like that:
First of all anonymity is not assured and the risk **Does exists** - but it can be minimized when this trade is conducted properly (for now at least, that might change in the future)
Few examples from the "simple" end user side: 
1. People trust the vendor's "stealth" in shipping the items
2. People trust the low chance of their mail being detected in out of the large amount of normal mail (assuming the vendor's stealth is decent)
3. Others use some other measures to make sure any intercepted package could not be easily linked to their identity.
4. People are taking the risk as we know, statistically, that the number of people who were arrest for these activities is very low compared to the HUGE amount of people using these methods - assuming LE does not have any specific info about a specific person.
And there is much more, but yeah i would say that there is a risk but as we can see at this this it is manageable when you know what you are doing.
(** Do note that i am referring to small time buyers mostly and not vendors and resellers - since this is a whole different story)

So reliable throwaway account.

There were many before but SR1 was the biggest, was backed up by a huge supporting community, the one who lasted longest, was most innovative (hedged funds,escrow,rating and ebay style), was driven by its (alleged) owner ideology and not greed, and the most trustworthy one -  BY FAR.

I don't like it, but i fully respect your decision &amp; choose to not censor the interview.

Any Thought on this approach to that subject? a bit of a different POV.

Cause you got to have some kind of escrow, somehow... Otherwise its just sending money to random people with no protection at all.
