Bitcoin shouldn't be what the loudest voices want

Anything can happen in 6 days in Bitcoin, let alone six months.
Amateur announcement!

That sounds like coercion to me but people are free to do that. I'm not trying to provoke you but I would interpret that like a spoiled child screaming until they get their way. I respect the idea of people getting together and building an alternative that suits them much more.
I think your sentiment takes many things for granted. If you want Bitcoin to work like digital cash then appreciation for the block size argument should be apparent. 
You don't find it just a tad arrogant to stand up and basically say "I found something more important than what everyone else is talking about and the only support I have is 'this is important' and 'get people together to complain louder'" ??

Absolutely. 


Yup. You asked something along the lines of "Can non-doctors comment on cancer" and I was attempting to explain why maybe you aren't receiving the respect you seem to be communicating you feel you deserve

What is your job? I do not know how to do it but maybe I should show up to your place of business and tell you what you need to focus on?

I would value their opinion significantly less, so little as to be unnoticeable and as equally valuable, compared to an oncologist.
What you are talking about doing is called 'griping', not giving feedback.

Absolutely no one should sign up for this.

No ty. Opportunity cost. I would rather use that time to do something valuable

There are many informed and educated people who argue this should never have been the case. If anything, TCPIP is a relic left over from the days when government ran everything
