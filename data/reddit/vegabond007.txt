So pardon the ignorance... why does bitcoin need to work out? I'm all for what the technology offers but does it need to be bitcoin? Why not create a "new" bitcoin that addresses the scalability issues and other issues and simply allow current bitcoin holders to trade in for the new coin at a one to one ratio? I know bitcoin is the most popular crypto currency out there but popular does not mean it will address the issues that can make it sustainable and scalable.

Right, because I routinely hear liberal talking heads call for mass murder of portions of the population... Can't imagine why a platform might not want them on there...

Sure, but I don't think it's a fair comparison to compare crypto vs far right ideology. One is currency that can be used for vast amounts of things. The other routinely seems to call for mass murder of people they disagree with or find undesirable for a number of reasons. It's not hard to see why they are kicked off mainstream platforms. As for crypto I don't know why yt is doing it. I find the current plan regarding demonization etc to just be dumb. Though it is a free market people can go elsewhere. The trick is going a place that hasn't become a cesspool. Most sites need moderation, the hard part is striking a good balance.

It may be feasible in rent alone. Right now they are saying $1,300 a passenger. Can you find a place in SF for that price?

that was my initial thoughts as well.
