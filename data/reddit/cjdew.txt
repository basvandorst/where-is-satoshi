I'm curious how this might happen, would it require forking the blockchain and updating to a new algorithm?  
Would current coins/keys be safe through this process, so that I'll still hold the same number on the new blockchain?

searched but there seem to be a lot of conflicting views. hoping to get more details on some of the specific points asked

Ok, but it sounds like the process itself, forking and modifying the algorithm, wouldn't cause a loss of coins/keys?  
So would this mean that the same SHA265 hash/keys would continue to be used, and could be protected from QC just by modifying the algorithm?

Imo this is positive for both ltc and btc, especially if the other major exchanges follow suit, as the addition of another crypto like ltc would hugely increase cross-exchange liquidity and effectively eradicate the arbitrage/price-spread across exchanges for both cryptos.

Great talk from author Jeremy Rifkin on societal trends such as decentralization, 3D printing, deflationary economies, transitioning to clean/off-grid energy, supply-chain management, and smart products (which he terms 'the internet of things').  
However, a glaring piece of the puzzle that he seems to overlook, or simply fails to grasp, is that, at least imo, much of what he discusses will be enabled and facilitated by the blockchain technology inherent in bitcoin.

Thanks, I am obviously by no means an expert in this :)


This is similar to what I've been reading here:
* Bitcoin ECDSA algorithm would be broken. Because quantum computers can easily decrypt the private key using the public key, anyone with a quantum computer can extract Bitcoins using the corresponding public key.
* Bitcoin hashing would become exponentially difficult. There's already a predicted escalation in mining difficulty due to the advent of ASIC, and quantum computers would create a spike in mining difficulty to which ASIC mining effects pale in comparison. In the short run, this would lead to hyperinflation, but the long run effects aren't known at this point.
* The hashing advantage of quantum computer will be curtailed by block mining limitations. This means that the rate of block creation will not be impacted by quantum computers (the increase in key generation is proportional to the increase in difficulty, resulting in an overall mining rate of 1 bitcoin every 10 minutes), but it will drastically increase the mining difficulty, exponentially more than ASIC miner already have. This gives miners with quantum computers (presumably corporations, government agencies, or other power organizations) a major advantage, to the point of being considered a monopoly, on the bitcoin market.


Interesting article on this here:
* D-Wave has 512 QuBits. A general purpose quantum computer of around 1500 QuBits would be sufficient to run Shors algorithm. If this were to be achieved it’s likely that Bitcoin would be abandoned

true, i was just using the title of the talk/book

So theoretically, in a worst case scenario where Bitcoin's ECDSA became susceptible to Quantum Computers, is it even possible for the bitcoin network to transition to another type of encryption while keeping the blockchain and mining network intact?

i think you misunderstand the comparison. the statement you refer to is meant to highlight the intrinsic value of a good or service that is BEYOND what is accounted for or measurable by the GDP indicator

mainly excited for midas since it could potentially mean we could soon see ltc support

ahh, ok thx!

will this actually prevent that from happening?  according to the coindesk article:
"if and when this happens, people will still be able to withdraw their money from Chinese exchanges, they just won’t be able to deposit new funds"
i'm still unsure of the implications..i imagine ppl would still be able to buy/exchange btc in person, as well as transfer to and from other exchanges, both inside and outside of china? would chinese citizens still be able to use 3rd party payment platforms operating outside of china?

buy/sell used to be separate tabs, they have added color coding as well as drop down menu for market/limit order.  much cleaner and more streamlined imo, but not sure when they actually changed this, haven't logged in for a couple days and (not surprisingly) no news update..was surprised not to have seen it mentioned on reddit though
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:36:20
is there anything substantial to go off here yet? or are we still trading off rumors? and if there is, where do you guys see the price going..keeping in mind that china accounts for less than half of all btc ownership
