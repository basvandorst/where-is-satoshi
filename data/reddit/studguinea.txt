Crypto currencies were created as a plaything and not initially intended to innovate. However, bitcoin has already exemplified the potentiality of an alternative to the central banks’ debt notes... bc that’s what cash is. Ultimately, the central banking system knows this is a threat. Therefore, these greedy fuckers that don’t give a rat’s ass about you will try to break it up. They run the governments - it’s all about money. Money, after you have all the things you want and surplus, is the means by which to gain power. That’s why they OWN this country... like Carlin said - no American Dream... no dream anywhere. Right now, it’s whatever the banks say.
They’re going to hijack it, ultimately, and kill it. They have the money to hire jackasses with super computers that definitely have the capability to crack the coding and wipe it out. By the time transaction saturation with crypto reaches 5% it will be all over...UNLESS enough people come together and believe in it.
It’s more than a buck, it’s an ideology, has been from the first few years. Only 25% of my portfolio is in BTC due to its potential (and sudden) failure. But it’s possible if these companies keep improving their security, it will last, mature and we will see a new dawn of financial freedom. 
But be warned - the banks see that $400-$600billion total valuation of crypto as money they’re missing out on. Don’t think they haven’t taken notice and are currently employing countermeasures. It’s a fight. Which side do you fall on???
