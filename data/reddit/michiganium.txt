I bet that after Trump's tweets and speaks about bitcoin most of ordinary people who didn't hold bitcoin, will think about it

This is actually my face when somebody tells me that bitcoin is rubbish and I'm stupid to hold it.

Coinbase is unreliable place. I really support traders.

Do not panic and hold BTC!

Hound of the Baskervilles.. Bitcoin socks is very pretty

This picture still amuses me :-) 
But I don’t understand the general hype, I just left Bitcoin alone until 2020.

I think it's insulting even to stand nearby..

Lol that's true! But the sence is one and no matter how you called bitcoin (or btc) everybody will understand you.

I realized that too late. now I wanted to withdraw my coins from coinbase, but my order has been hanging for 3 weeks already. I don't like it.

yes, you are right! I also think they are just bubbles (all this pax, trueusd, gemini, usdc etc), that will blow up after gaining critical mass!

I wanted to try to work with bitstamp, but so far I registered I almost died and interrupted halfway, spending half a day on it. KYC is awful! do with that smth!

Future is coming! A man looks like he has not btc..
@_date: 2019-01-13 14:34:27
Coinbase banned not only gab founder but a lot of ordinary people who can not be heard..
@_date: 2019-01-17 14:03:57
