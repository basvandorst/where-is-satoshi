Auto-playing video is a no no.
Closed the tab as soon as it started out of annoyance.

You won't see BoA or any other Rothchild-owned bank supporting bitcoins as BTC is decentralized and the monetary base is fixed to an algorithm.

Also note that this guy is a tax lawyer. He will most certainly enjoy your business, and would love ALL bitcoiners to pay tax on their income.
Unfortunately direct tax is theft and I will not be made a fool by complying with it. Others are free to make fools of themselves, however.

Despite BTC trading for 70-something USD, we are still in the early adopters phase (albeit not the very early).
Every globally-used product has to start with and capture a single demographic; It's the best way to grow something naturally. Hell, Facebook started with a single university. Bitcoin's demographic is the tech world, and we're not yet past this stage.

If a casino was modifying the client-side scripts with xhr it would be extremely easy for any webdev or computer enthusiast to detect and report it.
I doubt BitZino would risk this. I know I wouldn't. Bitcoin is filled with tech-literate people and you'd probably be outed pretty quickly.
Your **stalling** method is interesting, though. Bravo.

Spending someone else's money on someone else: No incentive.  
Spending someone else's money on you: Incentive for quality only.  
Spending your money on someone else: Incentive for cost-efficiency only.  
Spending your money on you: Incentive for quality+cost-efficiency.

It's my belief that the government isn't cracking down on Bitcoin itself because it will tip off the government-hating citizens that it is indeed powerful, and a force to be reckoned with. (thus, widespread adoption ensues)
I believe instead that the government is trying to attach negative connotations to it. You can see this plot unfolding as the MSM extends the original talks about how Bitcoin was a way for criminals to buy and sell illegal drugs on the internet, to now talking about how it's used for money laundering and other "bad, criminal things"
So... "Bitcoin" = "criminal/dangerous". That's what I think the gov is trying to do.

You can't just say that taxation isn't immoral and be done with it: It IS immoral.
It's nobile to take money from your pocket and give it to the less-fortunate or collective, however, it's unethical to reach into somebody else's pocket to accomplish those same humanitarian goals. No matter how virtuous your goal, if you have to steal to get there, you're doing it wrong.


Because it is still wrong. What the gov does with their profits is morally detestable, but it's beside the point.

Make Bitcoin suspicious?
What is more suspicious than an entity that steals 40% of my money on a weekly basis? You may call it childish, but I'll do whatever I can to keep their hands off my own property.

They *were* hackers.
If someone misinterprets what I say because they have prejudged someone by a title, they can fuck themselves. It's not my problem.
Also, these sheep who make assumptions like that are not and will never be early adopters of Bitcoin.

Hate to break it to you, but in every major paradigm shift, the major players in the beginning never stay that way.

I don't think you understand: I'm all for "pooling" money to handle large tasks.
What YOU advocate is to make this pooling mandatory. Correct me if I'm wrong, but what you believe is that the services that the government provides are so vital, that it justifies the mandatory confiscation of money from people?
Also, don't think I didn't catch how you inserted "end taxes immediately" as though I said this. I didn't.

"I'm not here to fight. I know there are people who think you shouldn't pay tax on Bitcoin at all, but we're just going to ignore that and not fight about it now..."
He then lectures about how it's wrong and unrealistic to think this way, and you're wrong if you do.

Not only did you spout off nothing but opinion, but even if your opinion were validated, I really don't care what immoral acts can do for a society. Are you trying to justify immoral behavior against an individual for the better of the collective?
If so, would you call yourself a Statist?

Before the edit:
Before you actually join the server, there are a few things you should know.
**The Staff**
The owner of the server can be extremely helpful and understanding. Unfortunately, he is hardly ever on and rarely responds to any kind of messaging. To counter this, he hired several staff members. One of which is someone you do NOT want to encounter. Any time a player has made a comment that could possibly put him or his actions in a negative light, he rants for a minimum of two hours, often saying "I'm going to stab somebody" or similar. Once, he muted a player globally and then proceeded to insult him for about an hour while he could not respond in any way. He has also been known to arbitrarily mute, ban, and kick players. That admin's name is DeviantTwo, so if you see him on the server then be sure to not say anything. The reason this is included in this page is that it truly ruins many player's experience of the server. Once banned a player has no claim to the bitcoins on their account. The player mentioned below had around half a Bitcoin on his account at the time of his ban and he was not allowed to withdraw it.
There is little to no consistency in the punishment. One player stole thousands of dollars worth of Bitcoins from the server by exploiting a glitch, yet he has not been punished as he gave them back. Another player was permanently banned for posting a misleading advertisement for the server that lead players to believe they would be given administrative abilities upon joining. The staff also deleted a post on the server's subreddit about staff abuse.
**Server Downtime**
The server often goes down without warning, sometimes for as long as a week, though usually somewhere around a day. The owner claims that no one loses money when the server goes down, but there have been claims of people losing as much as .1 BTC on bets that were never finished due to the server crashing.
The server does not actually have any rules that players are informed of upon joining, yet the administrators tend to make a habit of banning people for things they deem "common sense". Players have been muted or banned for simply having an argument with another player. If you do get banned, do not expect a reason from that staff member.
There are some glitches in the server. For example, if you try to drink two alcoholic drinks one after the other then they both disappear. Admins do not reimburse players for things lost to server bugs, so be wary of the bar.

There was some hope in this with WebRTC, but it turns out it isn't truly P2P.

So Bitcoin is cheap, no doubt. You still need to convince a business that the return on investment is even going to be worth the effort.
Companies will gain business from customers they normally would not have done business with. The Bitcoin user base, especially as of late, is large and biased toward companies that will let them pay with Bitcoin.
