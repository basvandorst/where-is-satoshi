Exchanges set their own price and offer many amenities and services that justify their price.  If you buy from ZipZap directly, our cost is set at 2% over Bitstamp rate with no other fees.  We are aiming to reduce this fee in the coming weeks as our volume increases and we offer Cash Out options in addition to Cash In.
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:39:25
We are not going anywhere!
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:54:14
We are not partnered with Neo/Bee.  Are they still in business?
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:38:45
Our current prices are around 2% above Bitstamp and we pay all fees to our partners including exchanges and Payzone.  I don't know how you got 20% premium.  You don't have to pay via SEPA, you can use cash and there are no fees.  How much does your bank charge you for SEPA or Faster Payment anyway?
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:59:58
We are not a payment point/agent as we have no point of sales in the UK (hence we use Payzone!). We are a "biller" or merchant on Payzone system.  You can see us listed under "Utilities and Bill payment" on Payzone's Store Locator.

You can in fact use bank account, as well as cash, to buy Bitcoin through ZipZap.  Our goal is to not only making it easier and more cost effective to buy Bitcoins in Brazil and across LATAM, but also to work with local partners and exchanges to increase mass adoption there.  We think the best use cases for Bitcoin (in that order) are: 1-remittance, 2- micro transaction, and 3- e-commerce.  
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:42:26
We are planning on having cash out options by the end of this year.
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:08:44
It's Payzone not PayPoint but that's a common mistake.  You should have a Payzone location within 1 Kilometer in the city and 5 kilometers in rural areas of the UK.

Thanks for your feedback.
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:57:07
They didn't say but it doesn't matter. We are now live with PayZone and very happy with it.
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:39:45
2% above BitStamp

There are 2.5 billion people in the world that are unbanked.  I don't even want them to get banked (wouldn't wish that on anyone). I prefer to bring them financial inclusion without banks. Bitcoin enables us to do that.   
For the first time in history,  we can instantaneously transfer wealth/value from one person to another across the globe without the need for an intermediary.  If you don't see the power in that, please keep using banks.
Plus, bitcoin the platform is even more exciting than Bitcoin the currency, threatening to disrupt many dinosaurs like insurance companies
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:26:17
Yes, we are like BitInstant 2.0.  Moneygram will no longer support digital currencies after BitInstant but we are working on other partnerships including bank deposits in the US coming within weeks. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 05:11:17
I agree. Volatility is a relative term.  Bitcoin looks pretty damn stable compared to Argentina Pesos!
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:54:28
Are you an exchange in the UK?  We would love to work with you if you are.
@_date: 2014-06-25 15:02:07
I will report these two bugs to our support team.  Thank you very much for bringing this to our attention.
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:47:08
Thank you for the positive feedback!
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:41:36
Do tell!
@_date: 2014-06-25 15:20:20
Government regulations are still not clear so we are still taking the most conservative approach of asking a lot of personal questions to identify you.  Each exchange will have their own processes for KYC. ZipZap is working to simplify our own KYC process as well.
@_date: 2014-06-25 02:51:40
we had some first day glitches which have now been resolved.  My apologies. Please try again. If you still have any issues, please email support and we will attend to your ticket ASAP
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:53:47
Got it.  Thank you very much for sharing this info
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:24:15
You have the option to get a new Blockchain wallet and BTC address or enter an existing one. The choice is yours.

I am still trying to figure out Reddit.  I am happy to chat with you personally.  Send me an email at alan.safahi
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:02:32
Please see this video on Youtube to discover how fast and simple it is:
The retailers/agents would not have bill payment partners like Payzone if they felt it deterred other cutomers

mulpacha;  Below please find my responses to your questions:
Which countries exactly?
You can find a list of our active countries on our web site at  (look for all the flags on the first page)!
How is your service free? At the buy page you say "This is the price of 1 bitcoin including exchange and ZipZap processing fees. The actual price will be determined by our exchange partner at the time of your payment." That would not lead me to think that buying bitcoins from you was a free service. Is it?
Bitcoin price fluctuates so our exchange partners will update the price continuously based on market rate.  This doesn't mean they or we add fees, only that we adjust for higher (or lower) price in the market.
In the near future, we will introduce a fixed rate price option as well 
It seems that I can only buy between €10 and €300. Any plan to let customers buy more at the time?
You can buy more than one order at a time (up to £1000/day) using cash and much higher using bank transfer.  
I can't find any info on delivery time. How soon after you receive a customers payment does the customer have the bitcoins?
Usually within minutes if everything is working as it should!

Hi everyone.  This is Alan Safahi, CEO of ZipZap.  We are not shut down by PayPoint.   We are still working with them for non-digital currency clients.  They only asked that we halt processing digital currency transactions until they have better legal clarification from government on Bitcoin which we hope to have within weeks.  
Meanwhile, we are pursuing other options as well. All is well but such is life dealing in the fiat world.  
We have some great news to announce this week on CoinDesk so stay tuned.  
@_date: 2014-02-11 05:17:24
Hell Yeah!!
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:41:22
We should not not focus too much on the value of Bitcoin and instead look at use cases
The best "payment" use case for digital currencies like bitcoin is remittance IMHO. Micro transactions and e-commerce will be big down the road (when merchants offer discount to lure customers away from credit cards).  
There are also many "non-payment" use cases such as title insurance, escrow, validation, etc. that are are HUGE.  
What I get the most excited about is the network effect and the tens of thousands of smart people working feverishly on building solutions on top of the blockchain.

Opps. Sorry.  I am still a Noob on Reddit.
@_date: 2014-07-15 05:58:06
I am very sorry about this lack of communication on our part. I do not recall seeing any emails from you.  Did you send to me to sales address? We are in fact VERY interested in working with resellers of any size.  Please provide your email address here and I will reach out to you directly.  You can also email Simon Nahnybida, SVP Business Development at Simon.Nahnybida  Thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:52:38
We are here to stay!  I agree though that we should not have any bearing on Bitcoin price.  We make it easier and more accessible and soon (we hope0 cheaper and simpler) but the price of Bitcoin should not rise and fall with any single announcement.  Stability is more valuable in the long haul.   
@_date: 2014-07-29 22:22:05
Thanks for posting this!
@_date: 2014-06-25 15:16:38
You can soon send money through ZipZap with no fees. That is the promise of digital currencies.  Remittance companies make enough money in currency conversion (5-10%) so the fact that that they also charge a fee (avg 9% and up to 25%) is borderline criminal
@_date: 2014-06-25 15:13:52
We use two different partners for ID verification. The first one asks some personal identification questions and if we find you in the database, that is all you need for approval. If we don;t find you, we switch to the 2nd provider that validates your ID and picture.  I understand your concerns but I can assure you that we take privacy very seriously.  Our management team has an average of 20 Years experience in the payment processing business with the established companies like Wells Fargo, BofA, MasterCard and Western Union (yes we are the guys we are fighting to disrupt!). If you prefer not to go thorugh this thrid party provider, you can submit your ID directly to ZipZap at support
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:42:15
Giving away our whole game plan!  Sheesh!
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:45:27
Thank you.  We have started some small advertising in the UK with much more coming soon.
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:21:53
We wish to work with everyone in the Bitcoin community.  There are strict due diligence requirements as an Exchange but we are looking to introduce an agent channel that is less stringent in the coming months. If you have a specific proposal, please email me at alan.safahi
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:56:06
That's a great question. Didn't say.   I guess they just needed to feel more comfortable with the whole thing.  In time, they will jump in.
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:35:46
I greatly appreciate the feedback. We are working on simplifying KYC AND reducing exchange rates. 
Afterall,our mission is to "simplify and democratize payments"!
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:33:29
Yes but there are no clear requirements for licensing so in the absence of these regulations, we have to assume the worse case scenario.  If you follow the news in the US, New York State Department of Financial Services just released the first set of license requirements called BitLicense.  After a 45 day public comment period and another 45-90 day internal review, we could have the very first Bitcoin License in the world which could set the stage for the rest of the states and the world.  The current version of BitLicense is quite rigorous, requiring full Know Your Customer customer identification (KYC) similar to what we do worldwide.  So if the law passes as stated and is coped by other states and countries, we would have been right to require full KYC for everyone.

Not that far down the road, Matt.  I am nearsighted!

Hi everyone.  Alan Safahi, CEO of ZipZap here.  
Thank you for your comments.  As promised a few months ago when we had to abruptly shut down, "WE ARE BACK"!
A few responses to comments:
- You can buy Bitcoins either directly through ZipZap ( or through one of our exchange partners like ANX, Bittylicious, Buybitcoin.sg,...(Safello, Kraken, CoinMKT and Coinfloor coming soon).
- We have tested this extensively but you are welcome to try (min order onour web site is £10 in the UK)
- We have significantly reduced our fees to our exchange partners and eliminated them for our direct customers after feedback from customers the last go around.  We have a small mark-up to cover the currency conversion but that, too , will get reduced as our volume increases and we get better at managing it (look for an announcement next week for a key hire as Head of Currency/FX).
- KYC is still required but we are looking at simplifying the requirements for the first time buyers and noobs (up to a certain volume) in the next few weeks
- Coindesk referred to 35 countries we are launching with but that was just in Europe.   As you can see from our web site, we are actually live in many more (100+) including some LATAM countries.  Some countries like the UK have cash payments, others have bank to bank (SEPA, Mr. Cash, iDeal, SOFORT, etc.) and the rest wire transfer to our partner bank in the US 
- We are now focusing on Cash Out options and are integrating with payment options  in 90+ countries to be launched within weeks 
- Once the two on-ramps and off-ramp are completed, we will launch a remittance product (within months)
We are committed to the digital currency movement and hope to solve real world problems with our product offering.
Please feel free to post or email your comments or suggestions for improvements (to info 
Thank you

I will take that bet!  Actually, I have spent a huge sum to make sure it is real and it works so you can say I have already made my bet
@_date: 2014-07-25 05:19:11
ZipZap is growing.  Please try us out in your local neighborhood and let us know what you think.  If you can't find your country listed on our web site at  let us know as well.  Thanks.
@_date: 2014-06-25 15:18:41
No. You will need to visit ZipZap or one of our exchange partners to register and place your order.  You will then receive a voucher (Payment Slip) that you can take to one of Payzone agents to pay
