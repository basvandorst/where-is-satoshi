Ulbright did - the FBI used a mouse jiggler on it.

Only if you really really like giving your tax money as welfare to billionaires.

Well then elect Democrats and taxes will go to better use.

I could teach people how cryptography works and why its useful in many situations. That's a lot more valuable than a spoon.

They could be amazing people. That doesn't mean this isn't really fucking stupid.

Try using something other than windows

I'm betting on dogecoin :p

I honestly thought it was for real, I just thought that many people watched it satirically, but I should probably be more cynical. Such is life, why be a hater, too many people are stupid or the system is biased to make me think that way.

I plan on it, I'd be scared to fuck up the security if I did it alone, I'm sure I'll post it here when I finish. I have a lot on my plate now, so I'll start most of the development over the summer. It's just in the design phase right now.

I've found yahoo to be even more atrocious than most. Think of the kind of person who actually spends most of their time on yahoo...

Imagine a chrome extension for spending bitcoins..you could use it to pay someone, but the extension could delay it a few minutes so you could always undo it before it's too late.  There are plenty of clever ways to fix this that don't necessarily rely on the bitcoin protocol.

[YAY BITCOIN](

Not since the civil war.

I don't think that's true.  There were/are plenty of other online black markets :p
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:35:14
True, or any other client. I'm working on a mobile client that is supposed to be as simple and intuitive as any other banking app (that can group wallets together for different "accounts") so that people who have no idea what Bitcoin is could still use this app. I think I might add this now.

Could you expand on this? Why am I using linux right now (in general)?
How would people use bitcoins without knowing they are bitcoins?
Just curious.
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:38:44
It could be like windows. When (if) a majority of people adopt crypto-currencies, if Bitcoin is the dominant one then we might just be stuck with it as the default, even if better options emerge.
@_date: 2013-07-17 12:52:10
Seems like a perfect way to launder money to me.
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:39:21
Perhaps a more mineable currency.
@_date: 2013-07-22 00:24:11
It's a cakewalk to not pay taxes when you get paid in cash. In fact, most people I've seen don't.
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:13:59
That is definitely true. I even think if Mozilla made such a thing it could reach a wider audience than Bitcoin. I basically meant that whenever crypto-currencies become mainstream, whatever is accepted at first by most people will probably be dominant (unless it turns out to be more like AOL than Windows).

This is what I love. Keynesian theory is the best current macroeconomic theory describing our world economy, but I love playing with the math when including a bitcoin-type currency. The future is to be had by those in the know.
@_date: 2013-04-09 05:46:35
Which is a good thing.
@_date: 2013-07-22 00:33:06
It's much more difficult, but still not an argument that bitcoin shouldn't be accepted as payment. The Internet makes it a lot easier to view kiddie porn but that doesn't mean you shouldn't use the Internet.
@_date: 2013-05-21 18:38:54
Bitcoin makes this much easier. Paypal, etc can be a nightmare, especially when dealing with a large amount of cash.
