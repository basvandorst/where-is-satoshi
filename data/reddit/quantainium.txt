Yeah in the end exchanges are the ones buying the usdt. So they have the faith in them. Noones buying millions of usdt with USD to put it on the exchange. So the exchanges trust usdt. Even if usdt is completely fabricated... Exchanges make crazy money off of fees. The only exchange that will close if tether goes under is bitifinix because they own tether and will be leaving with the money too. Exchanges make too much money to care... Even the usdt they buy pays for itself. Like binance. 445m 24 hour volume with usdt/btc pair.. They make 0.1% at the very least from both makers and takers.. So 0.445 million per day just from bitcoin usdt pair. So if binance has 45million usdt they bought... It's paid for in 100 days. After that it's all profitable. Edit fixed the numbers sorry.

They didn't double their money. It is like a bank account. You put money in and if you check it online you have more money! Wow doubled!..you can either spend it online as usdt or take it out as usd... We just have to trust them that they have the, 1.6b in the first place and that they continue to hold it.

I have no problems with the employees there buying a few bch for themselves before announcing it on the exchange.the employees there wouldn't have had enough capital on hand to buy a huge market share of bch like people claim. They had announced back in July that they were going to add support for bch by January. People probably saw they added the Api support for trading a week earlier than they added it to the exchange and decided to take advantage. The other sub had it posted that they might be adding it soon but things like that are banned from being posted on this sub because it's alt related. So when things actually happen this sub freaks out because they had no idea. I think they could of announced it and had everything ready to trade like they had the second day instead of the panic they caused the day before. The second attempt at a release was excecuted way better.

How rich do you think the employees at coinbase are? It's just a day job they don't have millions needed to influence the price of bch or btc.

When you're not actively using the service take your coins off the exchange and put it in your private wallet
@_date: 2018-01-01 14:22:33
Yeah it's great. And some other exchanges charge you no matter what miner fees are 
@_date: 2018-01-15 20:52:50
Supply will decrease from utxo and lost wallets aswell as unspendable dust left in wallets. I think 50% of addresses used are unspendable right now from the fees currently.

Bitcoin has the least room to grow of all the coins. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:06:07
That is only a problem if there is no money in the bank to back it up. If they have 1.6b in the bank then there's no problems with them trading with that.. But if that 1.6b isn't in the bank then tether is a scam.

There was only 4 seconds of trading happening last night. It was a scramble and I'm sure many people just put in market orders and were filled with people setting crazy high orders. It would of been nicer if they had their shit together beforehand like how they released it this morning. A lot better. They announced it was going to happen like Jan 1st. A few weeks ahead of schedule. Sell your bch air drop and get some extra Christmas money.
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:11:19
It could be. But that supply between traders diminishes as more holders buy and don't sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:05:39
No. Its only being tested.

Bitcoin cash is a legitimate community driven fork of bitcoin. All these other forks are money grabs and scams attempting to steal private keys. Bitcoin diamond was exclusively a scam

I very rarely spend 100$ at a time unless it's for groceries. Most of my transactions are less than 10$ 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:15:33
 every single exchange of one to another taxed. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:31:11
But what if the value of the dollar drops. 250k is a lot now.. But it was a lot more 50 years ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:51:12
Yes. But I do spend $100 in small chunks more than I spend it in large ones. If bitcoin holds its value better than a dollar I would want all my money in bitcoin. Holding it until I need to spend. But I spend money a lot. In small chunks all the time.. I want to use something that holds its value and is useful to spend at the same time. Bitcoin is not both and won't be until they learn to scale.
Two scenarios.
 I spend $1000 I fiat a month. 
 If I put $1000 into bitcoin and spend $1000 worth on goods... Bitcoin goes up in value 40% so I should save money right?
 Not with the fees being so high right now. It is not economical to use bitcoin at all. Bitcoin only has a purpose sitting on an exchange or in a wallet not moving and going up in price. Like in real life gold. It never moves from the vault and most owners never will see it in their own vaults. Fucking useless for commerce. If I want to hold onto a coin that can go up in price I want to be able to spend it actively and not just watch it sit in the bank. You can see it as oh I'm just putting my retirement money into it. I want to put all of my money into it and use it like the currency it is and the path bitcoin is on does not allow that to happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:19:11
Because coins not in circulation are dismissed from the market cap for other coins but not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:21:58
It has been a like kind exchange under a loophole. They are changing the loophole from property you own... To real property. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:23:03
It lowers supply. It doesn't increase demand but there is an impact. Imagine if the ideology here was to panic sell during crashes instead of holding.

@_date: 2017-12-13 23:43:18
Even with lightning.. You still need to get your coins onto the lightning network using bitcoin... So the fees may make your transaction impractical anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:22:14
Yes. You pay capital gains on it when you trade it for anything.(if it went up in value) But it is classified as property. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:59:14
 new tax laws going into affect Jan 1. Every change of hands of a crypto currency is a taxable event. You must record prices you buy and sell of every transaction. This is an attack on all crypto by the US government. Call your representative and speak out. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:12:41
Bitcoinnect tokens that are out of circulation because they are locked in loans are not included in the market cap. Even though they will be released within a year of being locked... But bitcoins that haven't had a move in 7 years are included in the market cap
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:48:35
All these air drops are training people to hold bitcoin for free money. Maybe if bitcoin actually adapted to increased demand with progressive features instead of high fees it wouldn't need to be Forked every few weeks.

@_date: 2017-12-15 18:40:45
I deposit from a credit card on coinbase and instant transfer to gdax to buy coins. Those days can mean more loss than the fees from a card. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 12:52:37
You may have just been incredibly lucky and got in on a quick block before they were able to package it. Sometimes blocks can be solved before the transactions can be selected
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:15:36
Bitcoin didn't even scale to 2mb with b2x Segwit has failed adoption and fees and the mem pool are higher than ever with ever increasing demand. Lightning is a joke and does not solve everything. You still need to put your coins onto the lightning network and to take it off and put it on you will still be forced to pay the fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:03:43
If you want to buy something to hold onto for a few years and watch it go up in price bitcoin is great. If you want useful technology use something else. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:48:06
Transfer it to gdax and sell it there. It's free and instant. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:31:54
Coins which haven't moved in 5 years maybe? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:50:38
They will buy every stock at that price. The value of the stock will match that set ask price. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:19:15
And stocks are sold at face value all at once in mergers 
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:21:26
Because without miners the bitcoin you know will shut down. If it had to cripple by until the next difficulty change at 20% its hash rate now everyone would flee the sinking ship before it had a chance to recover. That's why miners matter. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:36:15
Agreed. The value of the dollar is guaranteed to drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:13:44
Currency is taxed differently. Crypto is taxed as property according to irs 2014-21
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:28:51
Market cap doesn't work that way. That would be if every coin was sold at market value right then and there. Atleast a third of bitcoin are lost forever. And there is no way every coin would be sold at market value without it crashing the value

@_date: 2017-12-31 18:28:28
What if you day trade... Quite a bit and all of this happens on the exchange.. Let's say you put in 1 btc and a few months later take out 3 btc. Never converting to fiat or withdrawing. Since you never owned the private keys until you withdraw can you just pay the taxes on the increase from 1 to 3 because that was when you physically gained control of your keys? It seems like a pain in the ass to write hundreds of transactions a day. Also what if a bot was doing this trading for you. Would the taxed gains even be any different from 1 to 3 btc VS thousands of trades to get there? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:11:18
How do you know you're missing the left nut? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:43:40
After a company is announced to be bought... Usually at a price higher than the market cap that company already has so the deal goes through. The buying company usually drops in price a bit because they have to pay a premium to aquire. and the sold companies stock goes up a little to match the offered price. In the end the entire marketcap of that company is sold at or very near the face value of that Market cap. The price is not going to drop. That was all I am trying to explain. The entire market cap is useful in this case.. The same cannot be used for Cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:10:56
That's up 80% tho. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:25:20
They told everyone that support would be here by Jan 1st and they added bch trading api last week. It was public knowledge that bitcoin cash would be available for trading soon. But most people ignored it. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:55:47
After the company is officially bought the value of the stock not sold drops to zero. 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:49:58
From what I've read about lightning it leads away from peer to peer and towards centrilization and regulation. Because you will be sending your bitcoins through an intermediary they will be subject to regulations of that sort of mediary service. Lightning will be cheapest on the user the fewer nodes your transaction has to go through and all the nodes must have the balance you want to transfer on hand. This leads towards companies will large balances coming out on top scooping up all the fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:49:59
Yep cheaper fees faster transactions. Not a problem in my eyes. Bitcoin isn't doing so well if a cheap knock off coin can bring it down.

Have you looked up how the lightning network works? It's the definition of centrilization. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:24:21

That is only to find a specific address. If you are trying random addresses and do not care what the contents of those addresses are you can find keys 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:35:05
Yeah but there is also a thing known as the birthday paradox. For example with 23 randomly selected  people there's a 50% chance atleast one pair of them shares a birthday. This same thing can be used for bitcoin addresses.. It's completely unreasonable to find an address you're looking for though. Just randomly guessing them you will find keys eventually. The odds seem crazy high but it can be done

Idk if LBC is a scam or virus. Currently yeah it would take quite a while to find keys. But the technology and hash rate is only growing so I'd expect to see a real collision in twenty lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:19:17
 this is hitting every crypto. Anytime you do a trade for one crypto to another is going to be a taxable event. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:49:28
LBC says they only need 32487405889012096286998958570.8 trillion keys left before a collision. So only 1.3x10^26 days at current speed. Not too bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:17:52
A big difference is that many coins are lost forever. That's not true for stocks

If you really cared about protecting new users there should be a sticky at the top of the page warning new users to not buy, use or sell bitcoin in small amounts because the fees will dominate any transaction they make. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:45:25
Most of the trophies are puzzle winnings.. To incentivize mining and make you feel lucky. They are placed there by the pool in the search space to be found. I think atleast two PK seem to be legit collisions. This is a lot of hashing power and its not impossible to find keys like this.. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:07:43
If you counted that high you would know every single address to exist ever. That is not what I am saying. I'm saying you can randomly find keys. It takes a long time and a lot of power but it has been done. There are many many keys to addresses and you only need to find one. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:26:01
I'd they wanted to close the loophole they would remove the law entirely... They are changing the law from 'property' counting as a like kind exchange to 'real property' counting as a like kind exchange

Wallets start with a zero balance... So let's say you got the wallet and just got some bitcoin from an exchange... You send it to the wallet address in the app... Oh shit the bitcoin appears out of nowhere! what the fuck is this scam doing, how is this fraudulent it works exactly as a wallet should.

All I've seen is a fancy chart that says bitcoin 2017 non reversible. Segwit reversible. Bitcoin cash irreversible. To me it looked like replace by fee was new. I've never tried to replace by fee so I am just learning. Do you have a source I can look at to compare the coins that biased

People just one year ago were complaining about 20 cent transaction fees. Yet here we are today paying $3+ in fees every transaction. There's a serious scaling issue with bitcoin right now and the cancelation of b2x is a red flag of mine that bitcoin isn't going to be useful like Satoshi envisioned.

Are forks down the line going to have faster than 10 minute transactions? Or is that just pushing the problem further like increasing block size? I know BCH was having very fast blocks for this weekend due to all the hashpower. But is that a scalable solution? I think the problem really is.. How quickly is storage technology growing and how to balance that with bandwidth to maximize end user experience without compromising security or decentralization. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:43:09
It accepts both bitcoin and bitcoin cash... Why does it matter what wallets are created.... If you send bitcoin to the wallet in the app it will show as bitcoin. If you send to the same address for bitcoin cash it will accept it and list it as bitcoin cash. What is the problem.

Its gambling. Some exchanges let you trade more than you own. Let's say you have 5,000. You can buy 50,000 worth of Bitcoin with that on some exchanges. Very simply if you're using 10x leverage If Bitcoin goes down 10% you lose everything. If it goes down more than 10% you might actually owe the exchange money if your trade can't go through. But if Bitcoin goes up 10% you made double your money. Shorts and longs are just people betting with leverage for or against the price.

If you were looking to buy a car and had $10,000 and the car you wanted was 12,000.. With inflation you will never be able to buy that car... With deflation that car will become more affordable as you hold onto your fiat. Because the buying power of that money increases as you hold onto it. So instead of spending  the money you are encouraged to hold onto it. Imagine if a country had the hodl attitude and Noone wanted to spend their own currency because it would be worth so much more later. How the fuck would that be good for the economy. Noone would spend or invest because just holding onto their currency would be more profitable.

The people who work at coinbase are not millionaires... They are just regular people just like any of us. Honestly if they did actually go all in with bitcoin cash how much new money do you think would be put into the market assuming coinbase had 350 employees.. And what everyone put in 10k usd. That's 3.5m .. And it's not like coinbase didn't explicitly tell their employees they couldn't trade bch. Because they did. The reason bch raised in price the day or so before the launch was announced was because trading options were added to the api and people noticed. Rumors happened and that's all it needs to have a bull run going.
Edit here's a link to show the api was updated before the trading was announced or live
@_date: 2018-03-26 03:59:21
I don't think it being a Segwit wallet makes it happen sooner. Should still be 10 minute block times and the mining node chooses which transactions to include. 4 minutes is just close to when the block was ready to be found. 
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:14:18
No they added trading api for bch a week before they opened trading. People saw this and rumors spread. A lot of people in this sub did not hear about it because this sub is pro censorship of any alt coin talk at all unless it's bashing on alts. It's own little bubble.
Edit a link. Okay not a week but 3 days. 
Why would they add it to the api if they were only going to allow withdraws. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 15:49:02
If you were going to try to make serious money with a quantum computer against bitcoin it would be to crack satoshis original addresses. There was a less secure encryption type for public addresses back in the day so the public key was more exposed. Satoshi has about, 1m bitcoin. That's a nice chunk. Noone would be trying to mine with a quantum computer. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 11:45:46
It was 31 accounts selling via. They couldn't use one account or they wouldn't ever get the funds off binance before they shut down withdrawls because of the daily withdrawal limit.  But binance has automatic systems in place to shut down withdrawls for suspicious activity.

People don't really react rationally to news like their coin being added to a major exchange. They ran with the rumor and that's all that was need to go bullish. You are probably right but it doesn't matter when dealing with people hoping to make a quick buck. 
@_date: 2018-03-05 17:34:48
There was no insider information... The leak happened on the coinbase website for everyone to see three days before the trading went live.. They added bch wallet information to their api. This caused the bullrun before the launch that everyone says was insider trading. At the btc sub this was big news and the rumors spread about bch being added to trade on coinbase soon. Why would they add it to their api if they were only going to allow withdraws like people on this sub thought would happen by January like they told us last August.. The btc sub saw it added to the api and went bullish. This was a public leak.. It did not get posted to this sub because this is a heavily moderated sub against any alt talk at all unless it's bashing on another coin. There was no insider leak given to the whales only. This was a public leak of the api days before the trading went live. Everyone here loves to hate on coinbase for their shitty opening of the trading and I agree. It should have only been in post only mode from the start to settle liquidity. But there was no massive insider trading that this sub wants to imagine happened just because they ban any alt coin post.
@_date: 2018-03-03 16:41:19
This api change and rumors would have massively more potential to fuel the bull run before the announcement they made. Insider trading if it did happen wouldn't have nearly the scale of impact as this.

How does it move against you? If you're holding eth and ven. You're either going to have eth or ven in the end. You might miss out on gains because one goes without you. But as long as you dont panic it isn't a problem. For example my goal is to trade ven until I get 10,000. If eth shoots up and I'm not on it oh well that's not my goal. I want to gain ven.

@_date: 2017-09-23 19:16:22
Bitcoin are already stored online. So the best way to store them is the only way to store them. The only important thing is the private keys and how you protect them. Ideally you would have the private keys secured in such a way that enables your spouse or offspring access to them if you pass. So no passwords and no encryption. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:45:35
So if you had let's say 18 bitcoin and you suddenly died. You would wish them to be lost to your family?
@_date: 2018-02-05 03:01:44
Not really a problem for what I'm doing. I'm putting all of my mining profits into ven. Like 20$ per day. If ven drops 25% relative to ven I just get cheaper ven for my mining. If I can put 3 ven in daily and make 3% in trades daily I will make 10k ven in 70 days. Markets fluctuate way more than 3% per day. I usually have a sell offer quite high above going rate just incase of a whale buying the whole orderbook. Like 15% or more above the average over the past day or so. Looking at the usd value of the coins I'm holding can get depressing at times. I mean my ven was worth 30% more a week or so ago. Nothing I can do about that though. I don't have more than I can lose and it's a fun little challenge for myself. Just looking at your coins being at the mercy of the market isn't how I like to play. I'm not afraid to sell at a loss because I don't intend to stay out. I sell to increase my position and buy back in lower.

You need to encourage spending and investment. That's why as a country and leading currency it needs to be inflationary.

Well don't you have to give personal information to these ones like a driver license and it takes a photo of you? Like kyc? Maybe it's one of those doors that goes black once it's locked. I havnt seen one but it looks pretty cool anyway.

And in case you all didn't know this Roger ver did not endorse or put any focus on bitcoin cash until after Segwit 2x failed. Bitcoin cash was a thing for months before Roger ver started his bch campaign.

But you're right my statement wasn't correct. He stated months before hand that if Segwit failed he would change the bitcoin resources to bitcoin cash. We don't know what would of happened if Segwit2x  would of succeeded. I still find it funny that bch people were calling Roger ver a sellout to Segwit for endorsing it until it was clear it wouldn't upgrade to 2x.

Why do so many of the post here directly attack other coins. The rules specifically forbid alt coin discussion so stop circle jerking over every other coin and get your shit together. Bitcoin cash was a legitimate fork of bitcoin of ideological differences of development and the future of bitcoin. Stop focusing so much attention on this fork of bitcoin and call out actual scams or shit coins that have no future. I dislike how Roger ver is handling the fork itself. I do not like how he is trying to claim it is bitcoin. It's a fork and should stand on its own without trying to take the name. Things like saying bitcoin(bch) is pretty shitty imo.

Yes. It was clear Segwit 2x was having trouble gaining popularity and there were serious campaigns fighting against it for weeks before it was officially canceled. It wasn't like people didn't expect it to fail before it was canceled.
Roger was supporting 2x until it was clear it wouldn't pass then he would focus on bitcoin cash.

I think higher inflation encourages spending.  So you don't hold onto your wealth and just sit on it..  But I'm a scrub so..

Binance is pretty private.. They don't even keep your records longer than three months. Atleast that's the farthest I can download my transaction history.

The I can pull anything I want out of my ass on the internet theorem.  And I just mean you can translate anything to anything else.  Not that it has to be a universal sequence.  I just mean you can turn a 5 into a dickbutt if you try hard enough.

My wallet.

My password for my wallet is 37 characters long.  It's random alphanumeric. Didn't take that long to memorize and I feel it's safe.
