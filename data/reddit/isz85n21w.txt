I'm still very new to r/bitcoin, but I'm learning. Like never post an article about bitcoin that people are going to hate. You would think that people here would want to know what everyone is writing about bitcoin, and then make judgements regarding that magazine or financial news org. No, the person submitting the link is downvoted, so it's sort of a censorship by downvote, and I guess I learned my lesson.

I'll post the video when they archive it. He was in Silicon Valley on Friday, getting caught up on the latest technologies, meeting with over 20 different forward-thinking companies. It sounds like he met with Marc Andreessen and others who gave him an overview of bitcoin. Yes, he doesn't understand bitcoin like most people on this sub, but he did say that,  "I would absolutely invest in bitcoin." Not a bad recommendation from someone who currently airs on 400 stations and has the third most popular radio show in the United States.

Bitcoin will play out in the next three years . . . if Bitcoin doesn't die, we're looking at valuations at least 10 times higher than they are today within the next year, and possibly 100 times before the end of the year."

So strange that the author couldn't seem to pull the trigger and type the word "bitcoin" once for this article, yet this says Bitcoin with every word:
*One last happy thought: technology cannot be put back in the bottle.

From the comments [gastronaut ]:  it is a mistake to draw an analogy between Flooz.com and Bitcoin. The entire appeal of Bitcoin is that it is a technology- not a company.

I sent a message to their customer service which got a fairly fast reply:
*I know that some landline services offer a text to voice feature - so that could be an option for you. Otherwise, you may create a Google Voice account to receive text messages sent to your landline.
That said, it is a requirement to verify a phone number in order to set up an account with Circle. 
Please let us know if you have any further questions. *

Just an observation: the people who seem to be hating and criticizing Glenn for his lack of knowledge on bitcoin, or who are cringing because someone "like Glenn" can like the same things they like (bitcoin), have almost an equal if not greater lack of knowledge understanding Glenn, than Glenn does understanding bitcoin. Both sides need to get educated. 
For example, those dreaded, extremist haters of the Tea Party seem to be the first to show up with semi trucks full of supplies after a tornado annihilates a Midwestern town.

DIGITAL CURRENCY REPLACES LEGAL TENDER
by Venetia Tay
Digital currencies, including crypto-currencies, will thrive. Governments are exploring frameworks and systems to regulate and manage digital currencies, which will make their ubiquity in our everyday financial vernacular more profound. Ecuador’s Congress recently approved a reform to create a digital currency, and the New York State Department of Financial Services is considering establishing virtual currency exchanges. The UK government is calling for information about the benefits and risks of digital currencies. We can expect digital currencies to be used interchangeably with legal tender, giving birth to a frictionless, agile, universal payment system that will expand beyond the current banking ecosystem.

If I wanted to send more dollars to thumbtack on top of that dollar, (1) I'd have to know the location of that pole. (2) I'd have to have a friend or contact in the area to physically take a dollar bill, pull the thumbtack, hold the original bill in place, place the new bill on top, and replace thumbtack. If I wanted to only add 25 cents, I'd have to thumbtack a ziplock bag for change on top.

Search "HSBC" on this sub. We know. We don't have to spell it out.

There was also that Coke commercial . . . something about "the internet may never be the same" and I'm thinking -- you can now buy Coke with bitcoin!!! Yay! 
Wait, we did that already.

 &gt;But net neutrality is about keeping the market of internet services and content a free market
Yeah, and who says how that should happen? The free market or some bureaucrat in Washington? Say goodbye to the internet as you knew it. Say hello to picking winners and losers. Say hello to slower speeds. Say hello to introducing regulation that creates a lot of uncertainty, and the amount of uncertainty will grow not just because the FCC is involved, but with the FCC  involved, there will be all kinds of legal challenges as well, and who knows what direction that will take the internet as lawyers and politicians get their grubby hands into it. Whether it’s the legal uncertainty, whether it’s the FCC, whether it’s the turnover in the FCC in the future -- we don’t need it. The internet was all about  decentralization. Why do you want gatekeepers and regulators running it?

Why is it that Google got to see the rules, but ordinary citizens could not?
