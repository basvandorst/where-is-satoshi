Yeah, I'm aware that there are a few places that accept it. I have been around BTC for a long time.
 
The thing is though, for most people there's no reason for them to buy it. What reason is there for someone to spend money on BTC when it's expensive/a hassle to get hold of, and they can buy anything they need already with their credit card?
The only things that people buy BTC for that they can't easily get without it are illegal. Not that illegal things are a small market ;)

You can believe that bitcoin is an excellent idea and still realise that the recent market was the result of an unbelievable speculative circlejerk between a few thousand people who are probably too dim to be allowed financial independence in any sane society.
That's pretty much my opinion on the matter, in fact.

Let's use your pizza example.
I want to buy a pizza, I can either:
1-Use my bank card (fee of ~2.5% for the merchant, takes about 30 seconds).
2-Pay cash (no fee for the merchant, takes about 5 seconds).
3-Buy BTC and use that (I mean, I can't, because no food places around here accept it, but regardless) - fee of ~3% if using an exchange, takes anywhere between 2 and 8 working days.
A payment method that takes 1000 times longer than paying by card is not a step forward.
The only major retailers in BTC are clandestine websites - either helping people to circumvent stupid drug laws or stupid data laws.
I'm not going to say that BTC isn't useful, just that most of its actual uses are illegal ;)

How about naming it: "Operation: Lots of people with little to no financial knowledge relentlessly pump up the value of something whilst raving about how it's going to go up, apparently oblivious to the last four hundred years of financial hype and collapse, and then when the inevitable happens make up crazy conspiracy theories and post them to pastebin to try and lessen the pain of their ineptitude"?

Oh yeah, currencies that swing 50% inside half a day are all the rage in big business I hear.

This is just as likely as Gox or some shadowy cabal of market manipulators being responsible.
I like it.

Bullshit. Nobody has learned a goddamned thing.
We've been through this whole fucking cycle three or four times now and the same cluster of dipshits get caught out every single time.
I think the real lesson to learn here is:
-There needs to be some way to properly short this market so I can make money off you people.

You're a fucking idiot.
You walked into a bubble, a painfully obvious bubble, buying something you didn't understand at a price that didn't make sense, and now you're trying to blame your mistake on some sinister conspiracy rather than recognising your own failings.

I happen to think that we got into the proper bubble market at about $35.
I won't consider this a buy opportunity until the price hits about $40.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:49:57
He's completely right, of course.

If you were foolish enough to believe that your BTC were "worth" $260 a pop, that's not MtGox's fault.

I could not upvote this enough.

It's actually deeply entertaining. I stopped posting on all of the major bitcoin forums back when the whole BS&amp;T debacle was going on for exactly the same reason.
I don't know quite why, but this community attracts a lot of fucking morons.

I think we can say with confidence that drugs are the main driver of BTC prices... Or, at least, they're the only reason it has any value above $1...
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:33:13
Okay, what else are people buying BTC for, asides speculation/"investment"?
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:43:37
Gox is up: "THE PRICE IS CRASHING AND IT'S ALL MTGOX'S FAULT!!!1!"
Gox is down: "THE PRICE IS CRASHING AND IT'S ALL MTGOX's FAULT!!!"
What we never hear is:
"Hey guys, we absolutely got ahead of ourselves and shouldn't have been buying into this painfully obvious bubble"
