hey guys, ed from the vulcun team here -- what happened was we switched payment providers from stripe (who takes bitcoin) to paypal (who doesn't accept bitcoin) so we had to remove the option for now. we know there's a large bitcoin following (we're fans of cryptocurrency ourselves!) and we'll be looking at adding it back after tending to a few other more pressing product and site upgrades. let me know if you have any other questions!

I do both -- I live in a "bitcoin-savvy" area (SF) and there are many people who sell on craigslist and localbitcoins for a very low markup, which isn't worth it to me. The purchases I do get from craigslist are usually one-offs for small amounts of BTC and I end up actually spending more time explaining bitcoins to prospective buyers than selling them.  You also get the craigslost lowballers.

Yes, but you can buy bitcoins whenever you want from the comfort of your own computer -- it's not going to be easy to find someone who's willing to sell you bitcoins at market value - why would we when there's no incentive?

If we have money in MtGox what are our options for cashing out now?

sorry this happened to you op! i sell a decent amount of BTC on eBay and have gotten some good advice from - I understand nothing is foolproof but if you are going to buy on eBay, follow the rules:
- if it seems to good to be true, it probably is
- check the seller's feedback - i'm slowly gaining a lot of BTC feedbacks which assures my buyers
- if anything seems fishy, abort
on my end, I require:
- verified paypal address
- name on eBay needs to match paypal name
- proof of identity
- quick verification phone call
and i always take screenshots of everything, which i had to learn the hard way

Has someone actually bought something from BitPremier before?  Anyone wanna go in with me on an EXPENSIVE ITEM ONLY escrow service?
- get people to list their ridiculously rich items
- offer an escrow service
- disappear (???)
- PROFIT

why is it so incredulous? i've sold many a BTC on eBay at higher prices even..

Why not just use MtGox directly?  If you need any help with getting your account setup feel free to PM me

if you google the article name and click through from there it should work - i thought i linked that version though, sorry!

very little -- i had a more strenuous vetting process than most vendors and the scammers didn't like that :)
