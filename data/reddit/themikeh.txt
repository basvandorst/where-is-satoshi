What do you mean...does not protect you??

The value aspect goes for everyone that holds any BTC into the fork....sorry should I say hodl.

Nicely done Erik. I often wonder if that isn't the main purpose of Bitcoin in the first place. At the heart of it all, an arena that provokes imagination, free expression and collective collaboration which ultimately rewards all participants who voluntarily oblige for getting it right. Imagine that, achieving economic prosperity without war or money. I'm excited the world has accepted such a challenge and I have no doubt that humanity is ready for it!

Great feed back.....just trying to understand the all the in's and out's I've been getting a lot of questions as of late regarding purchasing and keeping their BTC safe &amp; private from any external source. It really has nothing to do with legal/illegal activity. It's more so a case of people wanting their anonymity-which they're entitled to, I believe. Imagine living in a country where it is not permissible to send money outside your country.....really. The tragedy is someone has painted all of society with the same brush via exploiting our incapacity and laziness to think. Most people in this world are good-don't be lead to think otherwise.

This will end badly for Bitmain, I assure you. This kind of coercion is never progressive nor forward thinking. Yes humans forgive, but they never forget.

How much $$ to run per month net of satoshis made??

I think an important question miners can ask is "How can I evolve while making the whole better?" additionally, there are many developers who do not get paid for their work, the very work that the whole enjoys profiting off of. Lastly, the oil example is a horrible example of what you would like to be measured by. People may forgive but often never forget. Start viewing yourselves(miners) as 1 part of the system contributing to the whole not in isolation as to extract from the whole. JMO

Ok...this I understand, just wasn't sure if they would receive the BU also because they were not on an exchange. Thank you.

Interesting how both buyer and seller always believe they're the ones getting ripped off.

Go for it.....I would appreciate it. I just feel it's a neglected area-like with all brand awareness, we want global adoption, we encourage it's use and acknowledge how great it is but at the same time, I do not see much focus in this area. We need to optimize global perception and start to streamline all that Bitcoin is in a consistent manner. And what I mean by that, is, I do not see much attention given to Bitcoin's global social impact. What it could mean beyond it's functionality and technical marvel. We have many great people involved in this project, that I'm confident in their ability to continue the evolution of Bitcoins technology. I want to compliment their diligent work by ways of education and perception to strengthen belief.....I believe this can help society better associate with Bitcoin moving forward. Being that Bitcoin is a community project, ultimately all will decide. There is no better time, than today.

Yes....that would be perfect. Where can we post that for everyone to see? You will have to excuse me, I'm not very good with this kind of thing.
@_date: 2015-11-16 22:04:29
Thank you!!
@_date: 2015-11-16 22:47:58
I have a website, although not sure if that would be an appropriate place for it. I do want it to get a lot of attention for sure...I want full participation. What do you think?
@_date: 2015-11-17 03:22:41
I need to try something....I will go to bitcoin.com forum to place as well. Thank you for your help!!

They're making 250M per year by exploiting their customers....surely he made sure not to mention Bitcoin as did Lesley by stating such a system does not exist in the USA unless you have a bank account or credit card.....what a joke!! None the less, a fantastic prelude to Bitcoin, they did Bitcoin a great service by showing it to be a sustainable system. Only a matter of time and the banks and governments know it- SCARED!!!
@_date: 2015-11-17 01:09:40
Ok....so can we post this on here. How can I do that??
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:47:07
Well articulated. I am relatively new to Bitcoin, although I've fully adopted it's relevance and significance!! 
From what I've read thus far and from what I see, it seems that Bitcoin is facing a real and necessary challenge that is not necessarily an issue with the technology itself but our limited ability to enable critical thinking and understanding the unknown as human species.
If we can just acknowledge a few things, it would go a long way...."Human wisdom begins with the recognition of one's own ignorance" Socrates and "No problem can be solved from the same level of consciousness that created it" Albert Einstein
I am by no means advocating I have the answer but that's the point, realizing nobody does. Hindsight is 20/20 and what better way than to collectively figure this thing out. After all isn't that what open source is meant to be.....the system as whole is very strong, inherently balanced as nature itself is.
Have faith in Bitcoin, it can handle much more than what society assumes or pretends to know. Change is often very hard, although evolution thrives on it. As an outsider, looking in, I see these challenges as progress, not as an end as some would suggest. Where there is life, there is growth, action and awareness.
I believe Bitcoin has embarked on what it was ultimately meant to do.....enable and empower society to do phenomenal things and more importantly, truly bringing us together, inspiring one thought, one mind, one action.
"Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world, indeed it's the only thing that ever has." Margaret Mead

I disagree.....I would think he'd be quite impressed with the way this machine works! IMHO
@_date: 2015-11-17 19:22:58
Maybe....funny though!!
@_date: 2015-11-19 02:05:01
Saw it on your website.....cool!!
@_date: 2015-11-17 13:33:27
I guess we need to start somewhere.....love the slogan though:)
