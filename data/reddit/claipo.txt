Not really, the coins grow by percentage of your initial investments. If you spend A dollars on Bitcoins, assuming that Bitcoins go to $36,000, then the change has been 100% gain ((New_price-old_price)/old_price). Bitcoin's market cap is currenty 300 billion dollars, for the above to happen, there needs to be another 300 billion dollars invested into Bitcoins. Whereas, there are many other coins which are relatively new and still haven't reached their full potential. Let's say that you have a coin with a market cap of $10 million dollars, if it grows to $100 million dollars, you've just gotten 10 times more than your initial investments. You have a greater chance of getting more return through smaller cryptos who are currently under valued.

Imo don't get any coins whose names start with Bitcoin but is not Bitcoin- i.e. light, silver etc... Get solid coins that could actually complete or grow with Bitcoins. Visit sites like coinmarketcaps.com for a list of all coins out there. 
As for sites:  is one of the best ones out there. I think it's a Chinese exchange, but it's based in Japan- where cryptocurrencies are fully legal. I think it has hundreds of coins. You can't buy most of these cryptocurrencies directly, as it's only an exchange. You need to buy Bitcoins from elsewhere and then transfer it to your Binance account. Binance doesn't require verification for up to 2 BTC (i.e. $20K) worth of transactions/withdrawal, so it's easy to start trading.

I'm not too familiar with Challengelly. I personally use Binance (bookmark it), for some reason their site doesn't show up on Google without clicking on Ads. And ads in Crypto are notorious for phishing attacks. Check out also. 
Imo ripple is set for a breakout. It increased by a factor of 2-4, just a few days ago. A lot of banks in Asia have started using the ripple blockchain technology in Japan and South Korea. The bank of India is also rumored to have bought a $1 billion dollars worth just a few days ago. I think American Express also. It'll only take one news to make the price go substantially up. Another one that I have interest in is Genesis vision, it has a very low market cap right now and also a limited supply. I think it'll grow well in value.
The way in which I find coins is to find them through CoinMarketCap. But do you research before investing.

There are many problems with Bitcoin currently that we can't idly sit on, like many unconfirmed transactions. People are spending tens of dollars to send transactions that are taking days to confirm. BCash does seem to have a solution for this problem to a certain extent, but so do many other alt-coins. The problem with BCash is the people behind it. They've shown that they'll stop at nothing to deceive people into buying their coins, to the extent of wanting to take Bitcoin's name under the guise that BCash was Satoshi's main vision.

@_date: 2017-12-22 12:09:16
Paypal is easily reversible, Bitcoin isn't. It's almost impossible to buy Bitcoins with paypal because of this reason. Scammers would easily cheat merchants of their irreversible Bitcoins. Even if you find someone selling it with paypal, chances are you're going to pay exuberant fees, probably only get $15 worth of BTC compared to $30. With the network fees at the moment, it costs almost that much to send/receive Bitcoins, so you'll have close to no Bitcoin left over. 
Link your passport, and do bank transfer. That's the main way you can hope to get it. Once it comes to selling your Bitcoins, no exchange is going to allow you to sell it into Paypal. It's almost exclusively via bank. Unless you use LocalBitcoins, where you'll more than likely be scammed if you allow people to buy your coins via paypal.

That's almost $3000, yikes, too risky. Imo if you are open to losing $400, you should've used their debit/credit card option, it would lose $160 to fees as opposed to $400. Or better yet buy.bitcoin.com where you would lose $300 to fees (7.5% fee instead of CoinBase's 4%), instead of $400.

Yes. I used blockchain.com or blockchain.info from 2013 to up to about a few months ago, before moving to cold storage. My bitcoins were safe and sound throughout. I think they also allow you to import your own wallet, so that you have access to your own private keys, which makes it easy for you to recover your Bitcoins in case anything happens to Blockchain. Or better yet, their own wallet has seed words, which will allow you to recover your Bitcoins in case of any problems. 
But be very careful about phising scams on Google ads. Never click on a blockchain wallet google ad! Bookmark the website, also set 2 factor authentication.

The bitcoin(.)com credit/debit card buys are processed by Simplex. It's the same company which processes Bitcoin debit card payments for coinmama. I would give it a try, and see what happens. Before buying, you have to enter information like your address, and I'm sure that if Iowa is one of the restricted states, they will tell you before entering your debit/credit card information. They don't approve your purchases (i.e. charge your card) until everything on their end seem correct, and has been approved.

There are sh*tload of coins out there that'll probably make big returns in the near future. One of the best ones that I can think of is Genesis Vision. It's token for trading on the ethereum block chain, which uses smart contracts. It's barely a 2 weeks old, and grew up to 4x its initial price per token within a week, and pulled back a bit. It's still under valued. It's endorsed by Charlie Shrem.  
It's barely the only coin out there. Doing research into other cryptos that Bitcoin will gain you a lot more.

Look into Genesis Vision, it's a token. The coin is only 3 days old.  One of their Advisers is Charlie Shrem- a well known Bitcoin figure. It only only has a total supply of 4,000,000 coin at the moment, solid team and solid concept. It's dirt cheap right now at $1.98-$2.45 a coin. I strongly believe that they'll reach at least $10/pop before 2018 due to their low supply. If you can afford to shell out $100-$200 on it right now, I think it's a good short/long term investment. The value has been somewhat fluctuating, but it's literally a 4 day old coin. They're already on Big markets like Binance.

Actually that's not the fee. CoinBase is giving him 50 Bitcoins for just $4,000 as opposed to the $400,000 it's worth today. From what OP explains in other comments, the payment was stuck the first time, but now it's going through. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:02:08
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:40:23
Definitely CoinBase. Has the lowest fees for beginners, and uses the current market rate. You can use your debit card for instant purchases, or a bank wire. Cons: Not most private- at least, as Bitcoins was intended. Asks you for information like Identification card, address, last 4 digits of social etc... This is to verify your identity, and in the off chance the govt. needs this information for tax purposes, they know who to go after. But coinbase has fought against handing over these infos to the govt. CoinBase is also FDIC insured by the U.S. govt.
buy.bitcoin.com is probably the quickest way using a debit/credit card. Disclaimer that bitcoin.com is owned by Roger Ver, a once well looked-up on individual in the Bitcoin community, who's now pushing the agenda of owning Bitcoin cash. But it's a complete legit way of getting Bitcoin. The payments are processed by simplex, which processes credit/debit card payments for many other big exchanges like Bitstamp. The good thing about this one is that you'll 80% of the time, you'll not need an ID, but you will need an address. The bad is that you'll be paying a 7.5% fee compared to CoinBase's 5% fee, the exchange rate per bitcoin is also $100-$200 higher, making that you'll be paying about %1-2% more, basically expect to get a little more than 10% less Bitcoins. They justify these high fees with the fact that credit/debit card transactions can be charged back, but the same isn't true for Bitcoins. Also, if they think that anything fishy is going on with the information you give them (i.e. address), they'll send you an email asking for verification before they approve your transaction. You'll need to upload a picture of your Driver's License, ID etc... in that case.
Gemini is also good. They only accept wire-transfer from your linked bank. Basically once you create your account and you have everything verified, you'll be able to place Bitcoin orders immediately once you initiate a wire transfer. You can buy/sell your Bitcoins for Bitcoin (i.e. at high and lows) and trade for other coins within Gemini, but you won't be able to transfer them out of Gemini until after they receive your wire transfer.

Pretty sure they have an entire catalogue of educational videos on [Bitcoins]( Given their popularity among kids/parents, this can help bring a lot more people to cryptocurrencies in general. 
As someone who went to a relatively sh*ty high school, Khan Academy is the only reason why I started to like Math/Science and ultimately obtained a Bachelor's in a Math/Science intensive subject, and about to get a Master's in one too.

Imo that's a terrible idea, especially right now, given how Bitcoin has dropped by $500 in the span of a few hours. Also the selling and buying rate will differ, added to the fee for buying and withdrawing the coin. You'll likely end up paying a lot more in "hidden fees" than your other options. Also, it's not instant. All of that you're talking about in the current climate will take at least a week to complete. You seem to need it now.

 ignoring the politics (i.e. Bitcoin.com is owned by Roger Ver, the same asshole helped take part in hijaking the Bitcoin network for a shtcoin called BCash.) The credit/debit card payments are processed by simplex (which processes credit card purchases of Bitcoins for sites like CoinMama, BitStamp etc...), as long as you have a valid credit/debit card more than half of the time you don't need information like SSN. If it's your first time buying, if your payment is rejected there is a high chance that your card was frozen automatically by the bank, as their algorithm probably detected it as a fraud transaction. If that's the case, call your bank ASAP, regardless of whether it's outside of their working hours, they'll have a security team on-call. They'll ask you to verify a few things like name etc... and verify the transactions before unfreezing your card. 
Cons: The fee is 7.5%, compared to Coinbase's 4%. Also their exchange rate (bitcoin per dollar) tend to be $100-$200 higher than the market value, so another 1%-2%. Also, though the majority of the time your transactions are confirmed ASAP, there is a small chance that you will have to upload a picture of your ID/Driver's License/Passport to validate your identity before they confirm the order. They'll usually send the page via email, and it took them less than 30 minutes last time, for me. The good thing is that they don't charge you until that verification is complete, if it's done. Also with the current congestion in the Bitcoin network, it may take a while to receive your coins, although if you use wallets like blockchain.info, it will show up as a pending transaction. The fee for sending the coins to your wallet may be charged to you, which has been known to go up to $10. 
Pro: Relatively less intrusive. With the volatility of Bitcoin, those fees won't make a bit difference.

Bitcoin is hardly the only coin on the market. If you want returns, there are literally thousands of other up-in-coming crypto currencies. Just ~1 week ago for example I bought some [Genesis Vision]( coins for $2/piece for a total of almost $250. Today, 1 week later it's worth almost $800. It also looks like a solid project with a solid team. It's very undervalued right now. Absolute best case scenario for Bitcoins is to grow to about $100K per coin, which will give you roughly $3000 at max. Whereas there are many other coins which are undervalued right now, that still have room to grow by 10-100 times their current values, which could net you 3k to 30k in the longrun. 
There are thousands of coins being built around amazing concepts. Use coinmarketcap to find coins. Do your little research, and invest into them.

The entire Bitcoin network is congested at the moment. As a result it's very uneconomical to send small transactions at the moment from anywhere. People are getting $10 to $50+ for a transaction of any size. The best way to transfer coins at the moment is to convert them to another Crypto like Euthereum, and then convert them back to BTC (this is if you're transferring to/from somewhere that has multiple currencies). See the sidebar of and contact olga from there, she'll take a look into it. Their email support is absolutely terrible, so you'll never hear back from that. Olga is the best way right now.

It's normally between: CoinBase, buy.bitcoin.com, localbitcoins, gemini and a few other simplex-ran credit/debit card to BTC processing exchanges. LocalBitcoins is a hassle, and the prices are typically marked up due to risks. simplex takes 5% off the top, and the exchange using them usually takes at least 1.5%. Gemini, which I have not admittedly used (but am familiar with), is probably cheap due to wire transfers costing next to nothing, but so does CoinBase when wire-transfer is used, as opposed to the much easier to use Debit/Credit card that most beginners would be familiar with. If it weren't for their sh*tty support, and overreach (in terms of privacy) CoinBase would be the perfect place to get BTC.

But we're not talking about all of "anywhere else", we're talking specifically about beginners as I made clear many times in my comments.

"Has the lowest fees for beginners..." what about what I wrote make me seem in anyway affiliated with them?

I'm pretty sure that Bitcoins are already taxed at around 15%-20%. Look it up, also there are some threads on it on Although don't mention Bitcoin gains there, because the mods are anti-bitcoin nazis who will ban you for the simple fact.

buy.bitcoin.com is the easiest way. Note that Bitcoin.com is owned by Roger Ver the gremlin trying to push BCash, but it's completely safe as far as buying coins go. The fee is relatively high though, at 7.5% compared to CoinBase's 3.75%, also their conversion rate is typically 1%-2% higher. The credit/debit card payment will be processed by Simplex, who does the processing for many big sites like Challengly. 
For the majority of the time, you won't need an ID. In limited cases, they may ask for an ID (or passport) before they approve your final payment. So you can use something like your passport instead. But you won't need to sign up for anything. 
As JaySpike mentioned, I think that Coinbase allows you to buy up to $700 daily without the ID verification. But you'll need to verify your address and last 4 of your SSN (for U.S. residents).

Something has always been off about this guy. He'll be endorsing BCash soon enough with Ver and the other phonies.

Coinbase is mostly only a starting point. They allow you to buy Bitcoins. To actually trade other cryptocurrencies you'll to create an account at an exchange with multiple other coins, i.e. Binance. Refer to this list ( It gives you the most popular exchange for each CrytoCurrency. You can also click on each Exchange to see what coins their offer. If you find specific coins, which you are interested in CoinMarketCap also has a list of exchanges which offer that coin. Let's take genesis vision for example:
If you click on their "market" tab at the bottom, you'll get a list of exchanges ( Binance is the most popular. You'll have to make an account at Binance (careful to not click on Ads on Google, due to phishing scams. Only go to binance.com, always double check the URL). Make an account and I think they allow you to trade instantly after. You'll need to find your Binance bitcoin address and send Bitcoins from CoinBase to Binance. Start with a little sum, just to test it out. After that you'll be able to buy other coins with Bitcoins from Binance. The same apply to most other exchanges.

That's different. Binance has their own coins which people can buy. But your Bitcoins remain Bitcoins. They tend to give you a discount if you use binance counts to pay for fees for trading, about half-off their fees. But I don't think that you even have to buy their coin for that to happen. Presumably half of the fee that you would normally pay is converted (in the back) to binance coins.

Holy sh..eer incompetence! A freshman level programming student would've probably caught this. I can't imagine what else could've wrong had this actually gone through.

People have been been saying this since bitcoins were $10 a piece.

Only posted it because I found it interesting, not as a way of reducibling it.
