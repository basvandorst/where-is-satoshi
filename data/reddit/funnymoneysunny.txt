How does any of that mean that bitcoin 'has value intrinsically'?
Just because somebody has invested money into a mining operation does not in and of itself make the coins valuable. It is the other way around: if the coins are valuable (or perceived to be valuable), *then* people will invest.
Do you see the difference?

You still don't get it, do you?

Can you explain this in more detail?

Even if any of that were true (it isn't) the cold wallet addresses would still not be known **publicly**, would they?

This is brilliant. Thank you for sharing.

When would a price bump suit you? How long are you hoping the prices remain this low for?

That's what I do when the candles are red.

Are you trying to tell me that this is *not* good for bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-02-04 00:47:05


This. It is remarkable how many people simply ASSUME that the addresses are known.

What proportion of people who browse this sub daily truly care about libertarian principles? If you had to give a rough guess.

Can we do the deal with a smart contract?

*Close* to capitulation? Late 2018 was a bloodbath.
Companies closing. Staff being let go -- left, right, and centre.
Personalities openly admitting their predictions were way off.

Do you really believe any of this?
And have you ever taken a basic economics class?

Personally I hope that bitcoin stays low until my retirement. I have no need for massive gainz until then, and would prefer to simply keep accumulating. In other words I am happy for the price to stay low for another thirty years or so. Who's with me?
