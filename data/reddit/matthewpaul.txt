Yeah. We used to get those alot. Don't deal with something until there is a structure designed to do so. Banks deal with ultra complex assets every day, bitcoin is just another asset.
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:07:58
I think that is where most people will diverge from the Bitcoin idea. The idea that control of a currency by a central bank is damaging is far from fact. It is an issue that is debated, with the majority of economists believing that stretching and inflating the money supply is essential now. And the idea that Bitcoin tries to subvert any possible regulation is a little scary. Finance without regulation becomes the wild west pretty damn quickly, as you are seeing with Bitcoin (opinion not fact).

Futures and options mainly operate from Chicago (CME). Many of the guys in Chicago hate wall street aswell. Banks have little to do with the operation of the traditional derivatives market, except for using them.

@_date: 2014-02-14 08:22:31
No they are not. More volume increases liquidity, which in turn increases price stability. You need price stability for people to be willing to hold it for a long period of time without a stupid level of risk. Who would possibly think it would be a good idea to buy bitcoin to spend now? 
@_date: 2014-02-14 08:13:06
I was asking the advantages to me using it. I have no problems with bank transfers, they happen instantly for me. My credit card statements are up to date. I'm not kidding no, most people really couldn't care less about bitcoin. Only tech industry people. 
@_date: 2014-02-23 12:40:33
Wow. What a collection of asshole responses. Im a prop futures trader, ex investment bank. So i have a good understand of markets and economics. And everything i post something here i get treated like i am stupid, or that i am trying to sabotage the idea. The perception of the "bitcoin community" in the wider finance industry is an extremely negative one, and this subreddit kind of proves that.
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:00:01
Not everyone reads this subreddit. Mtgox was the main exchange. Financial news ran that exchange as the main one. Based on peoples experience with other exchange structures (Globex, Nymex, NYSE) you expect a professional exchange.

@_date: 2014-02-23 11:01:08
Could somebody explain to me why? I just really do not get the advantages for most people. I am perfectly happy with my credit card, i have no problem with banking. I would never use bitcoin as a store of value due to its insane volatility, messy exchange structure and its unregulated wild west like marketplace. Could somebody give me an explanation of its advantages (without ideological ones, such as federal reserve issues ect)? 
@_date: 2014-02-23 13:39:08
Thankyou for an actual answer! Really appreciate it. I happen to agree in many ways with Keynesian economics, so the ideological stuff is not up my alley. However it does seem really advantageous for intercontinental money transfers!

I think its one the most interesting capitalist experiments ever. To privatise money is indeed revolutionary. I was commenting on how it should be marketed. I think the benefits of using Bitcoin for the average person should be front and centre, the revolutionary "down with the banks" talk will put people off. 
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:40:50

I do not think the USD is collapsing. I think Bitcoin is a speculative asset that people (including me) are shoving money into. The USD is not collapsing against any fiat currency or against gold. The idea that the USD is collapsing because its rate to bitcoin is falling is crazy. Do you actually believe that?
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:28:46
This move up so fast is not encouraging you know (im a trader). Im long BTC, but the 100 dollar move up so fast looks more and more like a speculative bubble everyday. What is fair value for BTC?

I think putting two people with differing opinions together like that with 2 mins to talk is never going to yield anything interesting. Joe Weisenthal is very good in those situations, and it is tempting to simply go aggressive if you have the upper hand. He seemed like an asshole in that interview, however he is very engaging on twitter. 
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:02:58
I think you missed my point. It does matter to me, but when marketing a message it has to be about how the vast majority of people will take it =)

@_date: 2013-11-07 14:46:06
To be honest i am here to make money, i do not really believe in the long term Bitcoin idea. At least not yet, i see it more of a commodity than a currency. You cannot have a currency that is not price stable, its too risky to do business with bitcoin at the moment. Buying lunch that changes price by massive amounts in the space of 5 mins is just ridiculous. When price stabilizes then i will take another look. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 09:41:27

@_date: 2013-11-07 16:46:51
You seriously cant be saying that a $64 dollar increase in BTC within a day is ok. No volatility model can contain something like that. Honest question, why should i believe in Bitcoin? And why should the masses take it seriously?
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:58:06
I really hope so.

Violence? What are you talking about. See, this is where alot of people stay clear of these kinds of things. Tinfoil hat wearing theories. The majority of people laugh at a statement like that, including me. If Bitcoin seems like something for crazy conspiracy theorists nobody will take you seriously.

There is tremendous power behind the USD. You are forced to pay taxes in USD and conduct most securities transactions in USD. Imagine if Bitcoin gained massive traction, people conducting everyday transactions in it, and holding it instead of transferring it into USD where it is taxed. The government is not going to let that happen, not a chance in hell. All it will take is a law saying that all transactions in Bitcoin would be on record at the SEC, so they can be taxed appropriately. People say the USD has no intrinsic value, well it has a legal basis, and the backing of the USA. If it came down to it, you can be forced to use it. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:23:27
Do you honestly believe that Bitcoin wont be controlled by the state. If it keeps gaining traction, its going to get regulated.
@_date: 2013-12-21 09:14:14
I agree about about QE not ending in 2014, i was trying to make a point. That is the official timeline, but i doubt they will stick to it :). I think keeping interest rates too low for long is starting to show now, and that could be a cause for concern. However i think the threat of hyperinflation is just not an issue at all right now. And yeah, some kind of black swan event could lead to higher inflation, but i do not think Bitcoin is a hedge against that kind of event. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:53:13
This will never change. Price on Bitcoin will never stabilize like fiat currency. This is the best you can hope for. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 12:00:54
They have started to taper QE you know right? It will be over by the end of 2014. Hyperinflation is not a risk at the moment. Gold bugs have been saying hyperinflation has been coming for the last 30 years. 
What evidence is there of a rapid devaluation of the dollar? 
@_date: 2013-12-19 02:24:33
I just think there is a clear difference between an investment and a speculative bet. I did not mean to insult your personal choice, and as long as you are aware of the risks, then go for it :).  It's just concerning that people here are putting ultra high amounts (sometimes other people's money) into bitcoin and thinking it is a wise investment without understanding the economics and market fundamentals.  
Trying to explain this in this subreddit would not be listened to, so I feel that getting the point across is easier if people make fun of the foolish decisions. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 08:10:14
As a future outlook its crazy. Bitcoin cannot replace Keynesian economics. Countries fund their operations, pay for welfare systems and control excesses in the economy by stretching and inflating the money supply. Whatever bitcoin is, it is not going to replace 100 years of economic thought. Its nice to think about as an ultra right wing fantasy, but a crypto currency sinking all the other currencies is just stupid.

I am talking about the marketing. This shit is not good marketing. It doesnt matter what is correct or "facts". If people try to market Bitcoin as the downfall of banks or something like that most people will laugh it off. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:13:21
It could be replaced. But Bitcoin would not be able to do it. Bitcoin is similar to other sound money ideas such as using a gold standard, however stretching and inflating the money supply is essential now for sovereign nations to remain solvent.  
Thinking Bitcoin can somehow replace that delusional. 
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:41:35
Yeah, i think the Bitcoin community as a whole is made up of people who have not been interested in financial instruments or markets before. And need to understand that having bears is essential and helpful, you need people on both sides to keep the argument balanced.

What are your thoughts at the moment on the reliance of the hedging capabilities of Coinbase? For me that seems like a major weak link in the structure in such a high volatility environment.

@_date: 2013-11-11 18:13:25
But you will still get paid in USD. You will still pay your taxes in USD. Welfare will still be distributed in USD, and the US will fund its operations in USD. Bitcoins have made me a tremendous amount of money, but their future as anything more than a speculative asset class is so far away from being proven. And the "end of the world trade" has been going on for ever, if it actually happened, you would need more than bitcoin. Plus, you just said that people will need Bitcoin because of a collapse in USD caused by people using Bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-12-19 14:17:50
I was commenting on the exchange structure. Fiat currency exchanges are essential for international companies to conduct business. The high volume in FX does keep the kind of volatility you see in commodity markets to a minimum. For example the change in EURUSD today is 0.661% so far, unlike Bitcoins +19%. Unless Bitcoin use is essential the volume and liquidity will simply not be there to maintain a price stability level that is attractive for companies to conduct business in it. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 10:04:55
The bitcoin fanatic community is a laughing stock pretty much everywhere in the financial world. People saying "I'm done with fiat currency now, will use bitcoin for everything" is just so fucking hilarious. So removed from reality.

Day traders are making it volatile? Volume and liquidity increase stability. Low volume and illiquid markets are the most volatile (take penny stocks). I dont think you understand capital markets. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 00:17:42
If your risk you are taking on is your entire net worth, you must be in college with about $500 net worth. Because anyone with an established base of wealth would never take on that risk. And acting like taking that risk on Bitcoin is normal and ok is setting a bad example. For people who do not understand financial markets (which 90% of Bitcoiners dont) the sheer size of the risk is not always apparent. Dont encourage behavior like this...
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:50:08

I like the idea. I really do. I just really dislike the side that places itself in. Its fanatical, no criticism can be accepted and nothing but blind faith is seen as positive for the subreddit. Healthy skepticism is great, and if Bitcoin succeeds great. But i have recieved 2 aggressive PM's, one telling me to kill myself over my bitcoin position. For a financial instrument, its very strange.  
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:02:50
Get Bitcoin at the CME and you would get a dramatic increase in liquidity really quickly. Many of us traded Twitter last week just because it was there. Traders will trade anything, and more people trading is good for the market. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:59:45
Having your entire net worth in one asset, especially an illiquid, unproven one such as Bitcoin is insanity. If you are willing to risk absolutely everything on a bet like that then i guess that is fair enough, but most people do not understand they are risking everything, and see Bitcoin as a sure thing.
