Fair enough! I agree with everything you said really. I was asking more for BTC as an investment. Obviously I have read more than 1 article (as you say there's hundreds of articles on crypto spouting all kinds of conflicting information) and have begun my educational journey into BTC/crypto.
My point was really this; BTC is at least one baby step past being purely speculative. You are invested in BTC and believe in it's long term value. Would you not encourage friends/loved ones to consider investing/learning about BTC? Even as a gamble? If I felt so strongly about BTC for the next 20+ years.. I wouldn't want my friends/loved ones too miss out. Also, not everyone has the brains/energy to learn and grasp this stuff. That's why we have financial advisors, etc. Ultimately, is it wrong to say to your best friend or sister "hey, assuming your finances are in order, here's why I think you should throw some cash here"?
Maybe my logic is flawed. It's like saying 10 years ago.. "hey, throw $250 on this BTC stuff, maybe one day it will make you a millionaire."
I'm in for the long-term myself and believe in the vision Bitcoin created. Admittedly I'm probably not much pass Bitcoin 101. I  check out that message, thanks!

If I may.. 
I understand operating a wallet. For the rest tho, why do you feel so strongly? Why would you advise someone to not invest in BTC if their knowledge is limited? What if said person read one good article (from someone they trust) and has a few friends who simply say "invest in BTC". Assuming this person has some financial IQ.. what is wrong with investing in BTC with nothing more than believing it is worth the risk and believe it can reach the moon?
