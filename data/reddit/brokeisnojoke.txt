Buying and exchanging are the same thing. If you buy bitcoin by using money it’s still an exchange. Likewise you can exchange a crypto for another crypto.  An Exchange in general can also be like a Broker for crypto currencies where you go to exchange them. There are few out there that are pretty good, as well as many more who are pretty bad.

There’s many options for you, but honestly I would recommend HitBTC. It’s an exchange with in depth charting and you can control the price you want to buy and sell. There’s no harm in at least taking a look at it:

It’s okay every trader makes that mistake at some point in their lives. At this point for Bitcoin however it doesn’t matter where you get in at lol you still profit.

Oh I would only get a small part of the transaction fee. I don’t get anything if you sign up but don’t trade. I just wanted to recommend you the Exchange that I use for my trades so why wouldn’t I send it to you if it’s there :P like I said you can just check it out and see how you feel about it. It’s free to sign up and you don’t have to trade. You can use the charts for free so that’s awesome which is what I love.

 Would recommend HitBTC. It’s not only good for Bitcoin but multiple other Crypto. I recommend it because it has in-depth charts and you can control he price you buy and sell your coins. Check it out if you want:

You can use a faucet to slowly get bitcoins if you don’t want to spend real money for them.
