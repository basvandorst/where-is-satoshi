Well you just lost that bet.  Transaction fees make up .005% of a miners reward and that has remained nearly unchanged since day   And I have yet to hear a credible explanation as to how miners will get paid in another 9 years when the subsidy is nearly gone.

Yea and while you're at it ask the people of Cyprus about Neo and Bee.

Yea I know its their capacity, maybe peak was the wrong word to use.  Regardless though, we should be comparing Visa's maximum capacity to bitcoin's maximum capacity.  To take Visa's average and compare it to bitcoin's maximum capacity is dishonest.  We should be comparing Visa's 56,000 to bitcoin's 3-7.

And the only mention of bitcoin in that PDF is this:
"BITCOIN: A flawed currency blueprint with a potentially useful application for the Eurozone"

Every block has been filled completely in the last 2 hours.  What metrics are you using?

Reports indicate over one dozen people effected by the outage...

Another thing to consider is that when people compare bitcoin transactions per second to Visa they are using the number in the Wiki which is 2,000.  Not only is that number 5 years old, it's a dishonest number to use.  Visa AVERAGES 2,000 transactions per second on any given day (5 years ago that is).  Visa's actual peak transaction limit as of 2014 is 56,000.  If you want to compare, you should compare bitcoin's maximum, 3 at the moment, to Visa's maximum, 56,000 at the moment.

Well bitcoin still uses a centralized ledger for all transactions so it is still subject to losing thousands of transactions as well if the ledger is corrupted.  When bitcoin was hacked the entire ledger had to be rolled back and transactions were lost, and correct me if I am wrong, but wasn't there another roll back of the block chain besides that?  Either way bitcoin is subject to losing transactions as well.

All of my transactions today which paid the default electrum fee were fully confirmed in normal times.
The volume of bitcoin transactions today was barely higher than normal, and it didn't even outpace the last stress test.  
C for effort.

Wow 14 transactions per second!  And who said bitcoin can't scale? /s

They should be forced?  I guess libertarians only enjoy free markets when it directly benefits them.

Haha bitcoiners get their panties in a twist when people say it's the currency of criminals.  Then they turn around and beg people to donate to their beloved profit who's spending the rest of his life in a cage for various crimes.  Oh and when you aren't pandering to convicted felons you're begging prostitutes to purchase bitcoin.  But bitcoin isn't or criminals, right?

If user adoption was happening that graph wouldn't be flat lined, it would be linearly increasing.  Fact is the money in the system right now is the same people slinging pennies back and forth to each other.

Because there's nothing to concede.  Bitcoin is only "booming" in Outside of the echo chamber bitcoin is an insignificant scam that still happens to be making rounds among libertarians.
As much as you all clamor on about free markets, you would think 2 years of a steadily crashing price would wake you up to the fact that bitcoin is stumbling around head first tripping over its shoe laces.
