Good chance for another quick leg up to $13,1xx today. Probably see a bit of a retest after that.

It will either go up, or go down, or stay the same.

It's great they brought it down, but it's no crack on privacy for a PUBLIC ledger.

I like it. Cost me .5% to buy Bitcoin. If I get a 3% discount, I am ahead 2.5%. Better than my 1 or 2% cashback on my CC. Company likes it because even if they convert straight back to fiat, they saved 2.5% over me using my CC.

Seems, overkill.

Mempool is not insanely backlogged like the previous run up in 2017.

Online sport betting companies love Bitcoin. It works well for them on many levels.

Correct there is no incentive, they were just pointing out that it's not impossible though.

If bitcoin is not going up 10% a month, it's being manipulated, dont ya know? /s

Difficulty does not really effect how many coins are mined. It does slightly as a massive swing can change how many blocks are confirmed in a given period, but the network will readjust it. Overall, its a predictable controlled release. The network targets 10 minute blocks and every block right now releases 12.5 BTC.
