I think Bitcoin is bubble in the making. It can burst days/weeks/months from now but It would burst

Are you sure? Many random people in my country are talking about it.

They talking about bitcoin, it's price, value and future. They didn't know too much and are far from being experts which prove my point. Some of them are naively enough to go for it to "get-rich-quick" and be [greater fool]( in Bitcoin bubble

Analogy is more about psychology than smell.

Similarities to previous bubbles. One of similarities is kind of overconfidence that many people shows here.

It happened. Your link just stated that some stories about it are exaggerated.

You people really believe anything is "guaranteed"?

It should be quite similar to both of them. Problem is period after bubble burst. It's possible bitcoin didn't rise that high again. It's new thing, some people see so many fascinating opportunities and maybe even something revolutionary but with so big expectanties it can be easily overestimated by enthusiasts same as [South Sea Company]( or [Missisipi Company]( were.
