When was the last time you went to a get a mortgage from bitcoin? How about a safe deposit box from bitcoin?
We're comparing apples to oranges here. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 01:40:33
That's all I wanted to hear. Good on you. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 21:53:31


Sure, but unless I'm buying a house with bitcoin, I'd rather borrow the currency that I need in order to make the transaction. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 21:23:50
I think you're wrong. No sane lender would do this. Ever. 5 years won't make a difference. 
@_date: 2014-07-13 17:15:26
Are you suggesting that the mortgage crisis would have played out differently if banks had been lending bitcoins instead dollars?
The currency that was used had nothing to do with that. I'm not even sure why you'd bother to bring up the lending crisis in this context, since it has nothing to do with our crypocurrency. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 21:22:36
Crowdfund a home loan though an incredibly volatile currency? I think I'd be better off taking a mortgage through the National Bank of Zimbabwe.

There has been some discussion as to whether or not you actually paid your capital gains taxes. Did you?
@_date: 2015-01-04 06:37:49
If you think of bitcoin as a currency, the you're on the right track. If you think of bitcoin as an investment, you're going to have a stressful time with all the fluctuations. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:19:19
It was fucking crippled. It was literally unusable as a day to day currency. 
I've been a proponent of bitcoin for a long time because it felt like an improvement over fiat, but I think we need to be ok with acknowledging the weaknesses of this system.  
@_date: 2018-03-05 19:56:11
People are being arrested for using it to dodge taxes. 
People are mistakenly under the impression that capital gains tax doesn't apply to bitcoin sales. The fed requires transactions over a certain value to be documented and taxable if they result in capital gains. Basically, some bitcoin users didn't do their taxes properly and are being convicted for their omissions.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:01:41


Ha. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:18:19
I just subscribed yesterday. I think bitcoins are an interesting thought experiment. I have to admit though, I mostly just like watching you guys alternately celebrate and cry whenever the value fluctuates. The comments sections in this sub are a riot. 
In the last day, I've seen someone get paid $400 internet dollars for a photo, I've heard about some poor guy who turned all his real retirement money into internet money, and watched people blame MT. Gox for popping a bubble. I've seen people think that bitcoin is a brand new tool for tax-evasion, and I've seen people argue over whether you can treat an investment as a currency and a currency as an investment. 
I gotta say, I love watching you guys and your speculations, theories, and freakouts. You guys are more entertaining than day traders.

But see, I think many people are building rigs for the exact purpose of producing bitcoin blocks. Still, I appreciate your explanation. Perhaps my understanding of bitcoin is incomplete.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:15:17
No, certainly not. It's not built to fail, but there aren't any safeguards against failure. 
At the moment, the biggest hurdle for bitcoin to overcome is that merchants have good reason for not accepting it as a valid form of payment. Nobody knows what it's worth, and that traditionally indicates worthlessness.
@_date: 2013-05-31 22:25:37
Sure, and I recognize the value in this. What worries me is that as time goes on, we will need more and more processing power to continue to maintain the stability and growth of the system. It will require hardware that could be put to much greater use, and I feel that these "growing pains" that bitcoin will experience in the coming years may threaten the feasibility of the e-currency system.  
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:39:00
oooh those too. Thank you. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:04:55
Nope, that's the cut that the coin changer is taking. Are you getting screwed? Yes. 
Welcome to the world of unregulated currency in an industry with little competition between coin-changers. The newcomers get hosed. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:57:52
Well, that can happen. The value can drop to zero. It probably won't, but there is literally *nothing* that impedes the price from falling that low. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:51:13
^ this. 
If they say they are unfamiliar with bitcoin, this is your chance to spread the word. After you've given them the short explanation, maybe they'd be interested in BTC tip. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:04:37
then I have lots of BTC to sell to you. $1000 per coin, agreed?
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:45:07
Stable countries don't like unstable pseudo-currency.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:06:31
Out of curiosity, is there a reason you haven't tried conventional investing?
@_date: 2013-04-29 18:51:38
"bitcoin is an online currency. You can use it to buy stuff online at certain websites, or trade it in for standard currency at an online exchange. It's pretty cool, and you can read more about the details of it online." 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:29:15
When he asks: "how much is a bitcoin worth today?" What will you tell him?
When he asks you the same question tomorrow, what will you tell him?
Who wants to be paid in a currency with such a volatile value? Say you mowed my lawn yesterday, and I owe you that $100 by the end of the week. If I payed you in bitcoins yesterday when the price was around $150 per coin, you'd have around $33 worth of bitcoins today. Your boss will want to know why those $33 worth of bitcoins are better than the $100 USD. Now say I pay you that bill tomorrow, if the price is suddenly $300 per coin, I'd rather just pay you in USD. 
If I'm a smart spender, your business will always lose. I'll always pay you in the currency with less value. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:09:41
That's fantastic. I love it. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:22:00
Wait, if you want to contribute to food campaigns, why do you need bitcoins? Do you live overseas?
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:56:04
Stable exchanges? ha.
Welcome to a decentralized currency.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:54:57
Remind us why you're here?
@_date: 2013-06-25 13:58:36
"dis gon b gud"
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:40:46
I think that's the heart of the problem. Spending bitcoins on actual goods and services is inconvenient for the average person/business. The only thing people can do with it is trade it like a stock.
@_date: 2013-06-14 21:46:46
A decentralized currency holding a centralized event? Something about this doesn't quite sit right with me. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:06:39
vulture... 
@_date: 2013-05-31 22:29:52


This is a fantastic idea. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 00:38:58
^ truth
@_date: 2013-06-13 05:54:07


The issue here is that once the house transaction is complete, then the seller of the house has to pay the capital gains on the conversion from BTC to fiat. I think this would be a major reason for why a home seller would be reluctant to accept bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 08:51:09


This would be no different than offering a massive discount for USD. If your goal is to offer a discount, then bitcoin is fine. If your goal is to be profitable, then the currency you accept shouldn't matter. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 05:59:05
Ask them to supply some credit references. Tell them that you'd like to speak to some of their other business partners at these 3rd party businesses. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:17:45
fair enough.
@_date: 2013-04-29 16:52:17
I don't know why people are downvoting you. A 20%+ tip sounds fantastic. 
@_date: 2013-05-31 22:22:37
I would never say that it's idle or useless, but given the diminishing rate of returns on mining, what will mining look like 5 years from now? ASIC's will get faster, no doubt, but will the capacity of mining rigs need to grow exponentially? It's concerns like this that worry me about the long term future of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:12:00


@_date: 2013-05-30 06:03:29
Sure. If you aren't a US citizen, and you didn't get your fiat currency in America, then the US regulators don't give a damn. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:31:44
I see allegations of campaign finance violations on the horizon. If bitcoins are anonymous, how will the party know if someone has contributed more than the federal maximum? 
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:21:22
Become stable? Why would it do that? -- I don't mean that as a rhetorical question. What I'm asking is what sort of situation or events need to happen for prices to stabilize. 
@_date: 2013-06-01 06:55:48


I don't think I agree with this. Negative media attention would be far cheaper and more effective if they wanted to keep bitcoin from becoming mainstream. Besides, my guess is that if large banks thought enough people were using bitcoin, they'd find some way to get in on the game. I think they stand to benefit more from offering services and charging fees, than they would from trying to gut bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:43:45


You have been. It sucks that you lost so much money, but that's what happens when you gamble/invest. 


You hit the nail on the head. Libertarians will hate you for it, but you are correct. 
@_date: 2013-07-04 08:53:15
So are you here to have a discussion, or what? I don't understand why you are posting this. 
@_date: 2013-04-30 04:36:09
But that's mainly what it's used for, right? Lets not sugarcoat it: people like the idea of an anonymous currency because it doesn't have any sort of paper trail that goes with it. It's the 21st century equivalent of cash. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:55:45
I'm at work so I won't click this, but I will give you and upvote. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 05:55:32
Show him how it's similar to accepting credit card payments, only that there aren't the same types of transaction fees. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:02:18
There are no regulations whatsoever. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:09:17
"sell all your bitcoins quickly and without ramification to others."
Please explain to me how this is possible. I'm dead serious. 
@_date: 2013-06-25 05:12:49
Wow. Your title is very misleading. The trade of gold has **not** been banned, and this isn't relevant to bitcoin.
