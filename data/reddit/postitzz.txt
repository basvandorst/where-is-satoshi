And if you want to go even deeper, you should check out the series about Bitcoin on Khan academy.

Helping prostitutes buy ads on Backpage.com is my guess. 
Not a scam... Yet!
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:13:20
That's totally obvious and everyone already knows that...

Neat story. 
Anyway you need to pay a fee now to get your drugs, sorry. 
"I don't use it for drugs!!!"
Then you don't need Bitcoin. 
"But I do need Bitcoin!!!"
Then pay the fee.

I hope I can answer your question but this is just a screenshot from the mobile app -Apple

You can buy 100,000,000th of a Bitcoin right now. They are called satoshis. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:44:58
The fucking can of pop being opened at 1:03 has me dead. 
Bitcoin makes everything worse. Even production value.

Show me one person that's had a hardware wallet hacked. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:10:27
False. I would buy all of them for $21 before they hit zero. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:14:15
Was that an exchange that got hacked 3 years ago?
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:15:16
So each block would have a 6.25 reward and 1800 in fees?
No. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:15:45
I don't see it...??
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:17:50
We want SECURITY ... maybe SECURITY is to keep fees high? 
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:10:52
"We are among for"
Are you the CEO of Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-08-29 14:49:09
lol what's the point of buying bitCoin if you don't even have the private keys? Lol, sucks to be them. 
@_date: 2017-08-29 15:58:51
One is to buy a house. One is to gaaaaaammmmmbbbblllllllleeeeeee.

Echo cahmber someone?.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:31:12
Stop speaking for "us"
Everything comes after security imho. Including low fees. I don't want both. I want one way more than anything else. 
@_date: 2017-04-28 11:41:23
This matters. 
2014: Welcome to Bitcoin. To get some sign up on XYZ website. 
2017: Welcome to Bitcoin, the party store 11 blocks away sells it. 
Progress. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 16:17:18
For low fees I recommend using Visa, MasterCard or PayPal. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 17:15:39
OMG thank you. But I'm not that bright. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:15:28
Only when we make all time highs.

A prostitute will be buying $20 in Bitcoin at a random party store in Detroit at 5pm. That's demand. She needs Bitcoin and will pay to get it.  
@_date: 2017-07-20 13:31:59
Wuz her
@_date: 2017-06-24 01:20:49
Whoa! Thank you very much!
How'd you find this post so late? If I may ask...
Just noticed your name lol. Ok maybe a search. 
Great response. Thanks again. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 01:33:09
Wonderful, your link to resources were things not coming up on my searches. So thanks again. 
@_date: 2017-06-24 20:16:19
Can confirm with previous comment. During the run up it was taking $2-$4 for fees. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 16:41:40
Yes, I and EVERYONE ELSE wants to know this??
@_date: 2017-06-24 21:23:43
Would a $1.99 of worked on 6/8/17?
Spoiler: no
Also checked my wallet again. Still no relevance to a $5 fee being needed at one point.
