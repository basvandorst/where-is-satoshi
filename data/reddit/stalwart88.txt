I haven't tried to withdraw any funds from it yet, both frontend and iOS app are buggy and they clearly manipulate prices and spreads for their own benefit. On the other hand, the service is easy to use, doesn't have arbitrary deposit limits like Coinbase, and social features like feeds, copytrading and copyfunds are cool. If you're only interested in hodling bitcoin though - look elsewhere.

eToro's rates and spreads are nowhere near "real" exchanges when BTC is in full rollercoaster mode. I guess it doesn't matter when hodling, but be aware if their business model.

It was way before torrents. I used to share music on floppies and used DOS version of RAR to split mp3 file between multiple disks. Back then 2-3 songs per day transfer rate was considered breakthrough

Satoshi could be from ex-USSR. Most of my childhood was in RARs

Yes, i was watching my money depreciate at an alarming rate. I bought more when it went up again, at 6500, so my average buy price went down to 6900. I gained much needed confidence in the genuine BTC while watching BHC shitstorm unfold, and now sitting on stop loss at 7600 to secure my profit and buy even more if there's another sale (lol)

If you have the balls to hold through dips - yeah, why not. I bought some at 7500 before the dip and held through

Use this opportunity to cut relationships with shitty people. Real friends will always cheer for your success and maybe ask for advice

I run a retrogaming club, and last week one of the visitors paid in Bitcoin. To play 20 year old games on a PC with CRT monitor, mind you.

Proper Linux package managers validate checksum of package before installing
