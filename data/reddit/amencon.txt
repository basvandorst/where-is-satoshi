There may be some centralized crypto that is useful, however the fact that it can be bought by a decentralized crypto is meaningless in this context.
I can buy USD with bitcoin, that doesn't add any security or usefulness to USD on it's own.

Believing that divisibility affects how "rare" something is might be the stupidest misconception I've seen bandied about in the crypto space.  
Is Gold not rare at all because it is almost infinitely divisible?  It's so stupid it's shocking it even has to be discussed/explained.  
Good thing I learned about this, next party I'll just order one small pizza but it'll be all good since I can just cut it into tiny slices, lol.

Thank you for taking the time and energy to push this position.  I mostly gave up bothering to a long time ago, as have many others unfortunately.  Even if the effort is futile it's nice to see some common sense in threads like these from time to time.  Sadly it won't change anything and you'll continue to see "perfect is the enemy of good", slippery slope, appeal to authority and every other brain-dead bullshit nonsensical argument that's been conjured up since the "debate" began.
Unfortunately this fee "crisis" was foreseen and discussed ad-nauseum for years.  It's not some emergency that needs fixing, it's literally by design and has been earned through long and grueling hours of internet bickering as well as  ostracizing of a large portion of the original community (developers, businesses, users).
I don't know why this was so hard fought for, but they got it now and I don't see why they'd give up all of a sudden.  Still though it's nice to see the effort.

There is no ponzi in mining, the rising difficulty isn't to process more transactions.  After difficulty adjustments (baked into Bitcoin and happen automatically) the same amount of transactions processed now could be handled by a single miner.  
If it went to $5k then some miners would be priced out and stop mining and the most efficient miners would stay in and stay profitable after difficulty adjusted again.  
Unless I misunderstood your post you seem to be grossly misinformed how Bitcoin works.
Increased difficulty only serves to add security to mining via making a 50% attack more expensive for nefarious entities.

As a programmer myself I understand considering as many scenarios as you can imagine, but you never code around every ridiculous potentiality.
The thought of everyone in the world losing all their coins accidentally before any remaining coins could be divided and redistributed among the network is absolutely ludicrous at face value, on the level of SHA256 being brute forced.
People used to throw away hard drives with amounts of bitcoins worth millions today, that doesn't happen very often because as coin value goes up the care and attention does too.  If enough coins are lost over time that it affects supply in a meaningful way then the remaining coins will be worth more, smaller and smaller fractions will be worth more and cared and attended to the way larger amounts are now.  
This could go on and on and even a change could be made relatively easily to allow bitcoins to be divided even further, but this will likely not be necessary on any timescale that will matter to us.
This is a total non issue.  
Though for curiosity sake can you walk me down a scenario where there is an even infinitesimally remote chance everyone loses their keys at once?  Global scale uniform hypnosis?
Hell even if there were entire groups of people intent on buying up as many coins as they could just to send them all to burn addresses we'd have plenty of satoshis to go around, plus they'd be worth a lot more once all those nutjobs ran out of money finally.

Bitstamp has worked pretty good so far for me, a couple times wires took a while to process but so far they've all gone through successfully.
Kraken had so many errors and buggy interface issues I gave up afters hours of trying to upload ID information.

They did the same to mine a couple years ago. In my case they gave no reason.  My best guess is that I may have sent some funds to a crypto casino to invest as the bankroll for people to gamble against but that's just speculation as I didn't have any other activity that could be construed as shady.  I've heard coinbase tracks coins withdrawn from their platform over a few hops so if coins were sent to another person that used it for blacklisted activities I believe they could close your account for that as well.

Technically it has a known monetary inflation schedule that diminishes every 4 years or so up to the year 2140 at which point there is no more inflation.  At any point where lost coins over time amount to more than coins added in the inflation schedule by miners then Bitcoin will be deflationary.
This is monetary inflation/deflation which is different than price inflation/deflation.  Often times people argue about "inflation" and are each talking about very different things.
Bitcoin is often referred to as a deflationary currency.  This is based on the assumption that since Bitcoin has a set and limited supply, over time the value of bitcoins will rise in price as opposed to the USD for example that loses purchasing power over time.

There are multiple "solutions" when "solving" a block so while the miner with the most hash power will solve more blocks, on average over time, than any other single miner they won't solve every block first.  To test a solution to a block is an easy hash function (actually multiple hash functions I think but keeping terminology simple if not completely technically accurate) so even a very slow miner has some chance to solve blocks since it will just test fewer solutions than a faster miner.
For example a miner with 10% of total hash power of the network will trend towards solving 10% of blocks on average even if it is the fastest single mining entity in existence.  This is why most mining is done in "pools" with many independent miners all guessing at solutions to solve the block and the winner sharing the rewards with others in the pools based on solutions guessed at (work done).
When difficulty resets it measures the total network hash rate and sets the difficulty so that on average one block will be found by the entire network every 10 minutes.  The distribution of time spend for found blocks can be modeled using a Poisson Distribution calculation.  In simple terms I think this means that blocks can be solved faster or much slower than 10 minutes even though they average out to once every 10 minutes.  If you were to plot how long each block took to solve, the data points that were farther out from the 10 minute average would happen in rarer cases.  So it's more likely a block will be solved in 11 minutes than 30 and only very rarely will it take over an hour or two.
Hope this helps.

Nobody ever said bitcoin would stop inflation.  There is a difference between price and monetary inflation.  
You seem to be referring to price inflation, bitcoin will act like anything else that rises and falls in price based supply and demand.
As far as monetary inflation, bitcoin has a known inflation schedule as opposed to fiat currencies.  Only in 2140 will bitcoin no longer have monetary inflation if it still exists.
The main take away is that with bitcoin inflation is better known than with other currencies, people that understand the very basics of bitcoin have very accurate expectations about inflation since its coded that way and open source.

All bitcoin will never be lost.  Worst case, coins that are lost cause supply to dry up so price goes up and people deal in smaller denominations of bitcoin since it's divisible up to 8 decimal places.  It is even an easy code change to allow divisibility to however decimal places are deemed necessary, but I'd bet this never becomes necessary.

The NSA has committed a lot of resources to help develop Hadoop which is also an open source project.  
Government agencies are willing to contribute to open source projects if they feel there is value to the project for their purposes even if those additions are available to others as well.
I wouldn’t say this is proof that bitcoin was created by an agency like the CIA, but there is precedent that they might help develop it if they felt it would help serve their purposes.

When you buy on an exchange like coinbase you are essentially buying an iou for the coin.  The control of the coins are retained by the exchange and they have some database that catalogs what you are owed tied to your exchange user account.  Keeping coins on an exchange is therefore risky and most here will advise against it for reasonably large sums as there is nothing to keep the exchange from just leaving with you coins, getting hacked and losing your funds or "getting hacked" and taking your coins while feigning innocence.
When you own a Bitcoin what you actually own is a private key that allows only you to send them to another address.  If someone else gains access to this private key then they own the value associated with the ledger entry that signifies the number of "coins" associated with the address and can also effect a ledger change to move that value to another address.

Then Bitcoin is processing double the transactions it would have otherwise.  That sounds better to me.  If neither end up being "good enough" then why bring that potential eventuality up as an argument against the better option?


Theoretically that could mean the equivalent of 8MB blocks in terms bandwidth required for propagation right?  It would likely take some time to have both an increase to 2MB and SW implemented and then even longer for SW transactions to be used exclusively as well as filling up new block sizes to full.  Is 8MB really that big of a deal in the next year or 2?  I haven't seen anyone lay out a good specific argument for blocks in that size range being a sufficiently centralizing factor to be dangerous to Bitcoin.  To be fair I haven't seen the same in support of that block size either.  Would be grateful to see one for either side of the argument if I've missed it.  Granted that the ask for 8MB blocks is very different than 2MB, didn't think about the multiplicative effect of SW when initially considering the increase to 2MB proposal in this thread.  At least this argument makes more sense to me than shitting on 7tps when compared to the 3.5tps alternative, so thanks for the expanded explanation of your concern.

Presumably in the context of this discussion we are stopping at doubling because that is our best chance for an increase to transaction capacity with enough consensus to actually implement.  I'm on board to more than double the capacity if we can do it with acceptable centralization and enough consensus to ensure a hard fork doesn't create 2 versions of Bitcoin of significant activity that last any appreciable amount of time.
If your point wasn't against increasing transaction capacity but for increasing it more than proposed then I misunderstood your comment.


My aim wasn't to rehash the debate of viability for 8MB blocks so fair enough.




I've done both, at first I ran it on a multipurpose machine and then at some point I re-purposed an older laptop for Bitcoin related things.  I suppose I do probably fall into the fortunate group as far as bandwidth even though most everyone I know has access to similar speeds so it doesn't seem to be anything special.

Not to take away from the generous gesture from bearjewpacabra, but Bitcoin's usefulness for it's "end users" come from it's network size.
Not that every addition to the network has the same value to everyone, but each new user adds some level of increased utility.  Getting new users in your circle of direct business and personal relationships is most valuable of course, however any increase helps.
Think of it like a new messaging app or social media platform.  There is almost no value in one with zero users, and reaches maximum potential value when everyone has it.

So instead of "massive multi gigabyte blocks" in a few years, it's actually a single gigabyte in 14 years?  More hyperbole.
"99% of this sub"? People in this sub have been discussing ramifications of block size limit changes for years.  Many have put a lot of time and effort into it more recently.  Yet somehow you interpret that as almost everyone here not wanting to evaluate risks of changes to the protocol?  More hyperbole.
I think it's these types of statements and the attitude that goes with it that makes this debate so contentious.  When arguments are no longer factual and instead made for emotional impact, rational debate is almost impossible.

Holding bitcoin has been great as a long term strategy (years).
Nobody has bought bitcoins, held them for 3 years, and ended up down on their investment yet.  This could change as previous performance isn’t a guarantee of future performance blah blah.
If you’re worried about short and mid term gains then hold and forget sucks as a strategy.  Different investors have different strategies and goals.  Not all strategies work for everyone.

If I'm not mistaken bitcoin transactions were stated to go UP in times of high rate price increases (too lazy to find link but I believe this was stated by Bit Pay during the April bubble).
It makes sense to me that "hoarders" that have had the price of their bitocins go up will be more likely to spend or donate them due to the high increase in purchasing power available to them.
You see some early adopters tipping hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of BTC on this very board.

No, the intermediary is a necessary first step.  Merchants that use BitPay or other third party merchant solutions ARE helping Bitcoin to spread.  As more merchants accept bitcoins (through intermediary or not) the incentive for some merchants to convert less BTC sales to fiat increases.  It will hopefully be a positive feedback loop that eventually ends in a wide network of merchants that conduct at least a portion of their business purely in BTC.
Even if down the road everyone isn't transacting purely in BTC, having more merchants accept it increases the utility of the currency and helps drive adoption.

It works a bit differently than that.  Difficulty only increases in response to increased mining hashrate so that inflation is kept relatively flat (12.5 btc / 10 min).
At certain block milestones the inflation rate is cut in half.  These milestones work out to roughly every 4 years.
If hashrate from miners went down for some reason difficulty would actually go down making it easier mine bitcoin to keep inflation flat again.
We started at 50 btc / 10 min, then moved to 25, now 12.5, in 2020 it will change again to 6.25 etc.  Last Bitcoin is estimated to be mined in 2140.

Part of the fun of the Bitcoin experiment, we can watch and see how all our theories pan out in practice.
I could be very wrong but I think that there will be some level of spending of saved bitcoins and that spending will be more common as adoption of users and merchants increase and therefore as the utility of bitcoin increases.

His point is that this message from an account belonging to the creator of Bitcoin about Dorian not being the creator of bitcoin does nothing to help discredit Leah's article beyond what we already knew.
"The real" Satoshi posting that Dorian was not the creator of bitcoin doesn't help confirm that Dorian is not the creator of bitcoin any more than Dorian denying it himself.
Beyond now knowing that the creator of Bitcoin is still active and around, this message is a bit of completely superfluous information in regards to the article and if Dorian is the same Satoshi that created Bitcoin.
If Leah's future career is going down the tubes for the article she wrote, it won't be in any part due to the information revealed in this reddit post, or shouldn't logically anyway.

How would you be giving up your labor?
To transition wealth from current government fiat to Bitcoin you would likely buy bitcoins.  Let's say you do work that nets you $100 in pay.  You could use that $100 to buy $100 worth of BTC, right?  Presumably you could now trade that BTC you hold for the same amount of goods you could have using the $ before the exchange.
Where did you give up "your labor" (other than whatever exchange fees are applied in the conversion)?

I'd also wager most people do not want to earn USD for the sake of having USD, they want to earn USD because they want the goods and services they can purchase with it.
This has nothing to do with backing.  It is true for BTC as well as USD.  These are mediums of exchange and they are valued for what can be exchanged for them in the future.
Not that I'm arguing with you that most people value their BTC in USD since USD is what they normally value the goods they want to exchange their money for.
Seems we don't really disagree with each other much here and it's mostly a semantics argument.

It takes a lot to overcome the network effect of a site like eBay.  Most of the value in the site is the fact that most other people use it for online auctions, there by giving "you" the shopper the widest selection.
Either a new site has to emerge that large numbers of people find out about that is hands down far better than eBay and everyone migrates in droves relatively quickly, or marginally better competitors will have to leach marketshare from them until a critical mass is reached and people abondon eBay with a quickness for the improved alternative(s).

I think you're right to be concerned about us going down the wrong path.  I'm worried about that as well.  
To me, that concern just feels like a separate issue from Bitcoin specifically though.

Bitshares describes the ecosystem not a DAC specifically.  BitsharesX is part of the Bitshares ecosystem but it is an actual product, a piece of code with it's own blockchain.
Bitshares Music will be another product with it's own blockchain but within the same Bitshares ecosystem.  It's code base is derived from a similar source as BitsharesX, they share similar code but are entirely separate programs.
Peertracks will be the front-end website that utilizes the Bitshares Music Code on the back-end.  When you interact with the Peertracks website, Peertracks will then issue commands to the Bitshares Music blockchain.
Theoretically in the future other websites might be built that directly compete with the Peertracks website, but connect to the same blockchain.  When you buy Notes in the Bitshares Music system you own the token representative of the back-end blockchain, thus such competition will only benefit investors of the Bitshares Music DAC.
Or at least that's how I understand it so far.  Hopefully this makes some kind of sense to you.

No, BRK-A Share is worth $185,000 according to the bet description.
The bet divides the USD value of 1 brk-a class share by the USD value for 1BTC to get a BTC to BRK-A Share ratio at start of bet (1 BRK-A / 314 BTC), it then recalculates this ratio at the end of the bet and sees if would take more or less BTC to equal a single BRK-A share.  More BTC means BTC has performed worse than BRK and the bet resolves to NO, less and the opposite is true.
Regardless though I'd be careful putting much if any money into this for the same reason EnglishBulldog gave.

For most merchant solutions I've seen, there is no upfront fees to begin collecting payments in bitcoins.  
Also exchange fees are usually very low, in fact Coinbase will waive all conversion fees for your first $1M in transactions: 
Overall if you don't care about being in control of your own wealth, don't care about helping to push innovation in finance and payment solutions, and aren't interested in the potential social impacts a voluntary global decentralized digital proof of ownership ledger brings, then maybe using bitcoins just isn't going to be very attractive or interesting for you.
I'm almost *more* excited about what future technologies and services will be developed that wouldn't be possible without the development of Bitcoin (DACs, scam-resistant assurance contracts, provably fair voting systems, all the things possible with programmable money etc.).  Greater widespread use of bitcoins will incentivize more developers to push these technologies forward even faster.

This doesn't really sound like a concern about Bitcoin but about some future hypothetical oppressive authority.  Are you also worried about microchips since this same imaginary government could start forcing implants into everyone? etc.
My point is that if we allow such a government to exist they won't need Bitcoin to stomp all over our freedoms, why be concerned about Bitcoin and not the vast myriad of other technologies someone could in theory, sometime, somewhere bring to bear on people for the purpose of controlling them.
New technologies will always carry the risk of being used for purposes we might not like, but that sword cuts both ways.  What's to say that in 2025 there aren't many Meshnet type networking alternatives thereby bypassing current ISPs gateways.
It's always fun to look into the future and speculate but I don't think there is anything here to be genuinely worried about yet.

When setting up my "brick and mortar" business I weighed the pros and cons between Square and SalesVu (and some other POS software solutions).  SalesVu offered .05% less fee per transaction and had built in punch clock services and what appeared to be more granular sales reporting.  Had Bitcoin been integrated with Square I'd have made a different selection and went with them instead.
Really hope they expand this for all Square POS terminals rather than just their online "Market", I can imagine plenty of other small business owners have been in the same situation I was when determining which POS software to use.
As a side note I have been very pleased with SalesVu so far.  Ideally Square will implement full Bitcoin integration and force other POS software companies to follow suit.

Happened twice for me:
First one was similar to most others (decentralized, deflationary, personally controlled "bank account" and general value transfer network etc.) after the first few days or weeks of studying what Bitcoin was.
Then after that I kept hearing about "programmable money" and that piqued my interest in a fuzzy general sort of way, without any concrete use cases for this in mind.
Then something really clicked again while listening to Mike Hearn's 2013 Turing Festival talk (on YouTube,  about how Bitcoin could be used by autonomous agents participating as economic actors.  
The mind boggles at the potential future possibilities of various DACs, not to mention who knows what other possible innovations may be made due to software able to possess it's own money and to receive and make payments without the manual intervention of people whatsoever.

Good question.  That way someone sending cash who uses bitcoin could bypass their stop to the teller step, but the money transaction is still kept in the Abra system and able to be turned to cash on the other end.
I suspect initially Abra wants to obfuscate the use of bitcoin entirely for the launch of the product, perhaps believing attaching the word bitcoin could distract via media reports / public perception from the service itself, but I suspect if Bitcoin rises in popularity/adoption or the app gathers a good reputation and large following it's something that will be added on eventually.

Then Moe should have responded with that.  To pretend that advertising a scam service and doing business with them is the best way to expose them is an insult to our intelligence.
People will lose money on this scam whether he speaks or not.  Bitcoin will continue on in mostly the same fashion whether or not he speaks at the conference.  This is a matter of principal though.  Do you support a service that supports scammers and advertises for them, or not?
If Moe is legally bound to honor some contract and that's why he won't pull Josh then I think that's going to be a lot easier to swallow for this community, but that's not what he communicated so I'm not sure why it's even being discussed.  How desperate are people to defend Moe and why?
@_date: 2015-01-05 03:28:23

Why didn't he communicate that then?
Instead the story we got was that keeping Josh on was for the benefit of the Bitcoin community.
If the only reason he is keeping Josh on is due to having already spent money collected from him before knowledge of the scam and is now contractually bound, then I can understand the shitty situation he is in better.
@_date: 2015-01-03 07:35:44
Does your theoretical feed the homeless program help legitimize the scam and advertise it?
Is the Miami conference a charity event or does Moe stand to make money with it?
Your comparison example is bad.
You also end by asking if it makes you a scammer.  I never made the claim that Moe is now a scammer.  I'm not even sure what "By your all logic it does" means honestly.
My point was that advertising for a scam and giving them a keynote speaker slot at a Bitcoin conference isn't the best way "expose" that scam, especially one that is already exposed.  The only reason Moe should keep Josh is if he has no other alternatives and if that's the case then he should have made it with the community rather than throw out some bullshit about how it's actually a good thing to keep him on.
@_date: 2015-01-04 23:53:27
No it's not obvious.  You think everyone automatically knows the exact wording of sponsorship contracts for this conference?  Your expectations that this should be common knowledge seem .. odd.
Is your contention that there are no precedents where an event found a sponsor unsavory and pulled them?  If it's happened before why would everyone here assume it's not a possibility in this case unless Moe addresses why that wouldn't be possible?
Moe has posted twice about his reasoning for keeping Josh on.  If the reason was as you state, he should have said something.  Instead we got something else entirely, twice.  The comments you see are responses to his claims that letting a scammer speak at his conference (as well as providing advertisement for said scam) is somehow beneficial to the Bitcoin community.
Now we are supposed to believe that he didn't mention having his hands tied in this matter twice before, but he'd totally explain it in an AMA but won't do that now because of the reaction to his poor communications from his first two posts? 
I think you're the one lacking rational judgement here.
@_date: 2015-01-03 01:35:46
"Network effect" isn't a boolean condition.  Bitcoin has a greater network effect than other crypto currencies.
The benefit of increased usefulness due to network effect for Bitcoin is still currently fairly minimal (none of my friends use it yet, allowing me to easily settle small debts with them etc.).  The increased network effect is having a huge impact on merchant adoption, investment of funds and building of infrastructure though.
There is a reason VC money is getting poured into BTC startups and not other coins.  There is a reason merchants like Microsoft are integrating payments with BTC payment processors and not those for other coins.
All else being equal, the crypto currency with the largest network effect currently has the best chances for increased use and adoption in the future and will therefore attract more investments, services and infrastructure to be built for it.
Someday Bitcoin could be overtaken by a competitor with a vastly superior feature set, but for now it appears this doesn't seem to be a likely outcome at least in the short term future.
@_date: 2015-01-17 19:09:08
Or you could understand the issue first.  It was that a bitcoin conference was advertising for and legitimizing a scam in return for money.
It's ironic, you seem to be more hostile than most others here, and instead of delusional you're apparently just ignorant.
Also why would you be turned off by a technology because of an online forum community?  There are plenty of people that frequent Bitcoin forums that I disagree with or think just sound dumb but I don't see how it's related to the blockchain.  Unless the only reason your interested in Bitcoin is for the meet ups and online discussions which frankly seems weird to me.

I'm sorry Eric but this is some of the worst logic I've seen from you.  By your logic if he sees so much value to giving a voice and pulpit to scammers then why doesn't Moe go out and invite all the worst scammers the Bitcoin scene has seen yet and fill his conference with them.  Greatest conference ever right?
If you were organizing a conference and known scammer wanted to speak at it and use your venue to advertise his fraudulent product, would you be in favor of this and do business with him?  If the answer is no then I'm not really sure why you're here defending Moe doing that very thing.
The notion that the best way to expose scams is to take their money and advertise their service or product is laughable at best.

We probably have very different browsing habits then.  It's also not uncommon for me to know what a tab represents based on it's placement.

Why post everywhere comparing it to VISA over and over?  It's intellectually dishonest.  Nobody is lobbying to fork to 2MB and then never make another upgrade again.  2MB DOUBLES the throughput capacity in the short term and avoids creating an unnecessarily extreme fee market.  That's not insignificant any way you slice it.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:35:23
Even as someone that supports "big blocks" I doubt something like LN will ever become irrelevant.  The name of the game is keeping as much runway available (transaction throughput wise) as possible at any given moment.  That means scaling whenever and however possible that keeps bitcoin secure and decentralized enough and LN will almost certainly help do great things for bitcoin at some point in this regard.
@_date: 2016-01-13 17:40:52
The worst effects you'd probably never see at all.  They'll be those of missed opportunities due to the chilling effect a failure to confidently scale brings.
We will probably never know what services and technologies could have grown up around Bitcoin had there been a consensus for timely scaling solutions that maximized our current technological limitations.
Queue numerous "small block" proponents declaring victory since no substantial visible damage is apparent.
I'm sure if we keep the 1MB limit Bitcoin will continue to "work", it'll just be smaller and less used than it could have been.
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:08:25
Ok sure we can use your analogy but let's apply it fairly.  Even someone that expected a bitcoin to be worth a million dollars some day would have to admit that a $400+ increase in price short term, while a drop in the bucket compared to ultimate price target, would be a significant move of the market.
Any time you double capacity for a service or technology it is a significant event.  For Bitcoin it means all growth since its inception that has translated to on chain transactions could happen all over again before we start hitting the limit again.
There might be good arguments against a 2MB hard fork but it being so small compared to the total capacity of VISA isn't one of them.
@_date: 2016-01-23 01:22:43
It is fair since blocks are close to full by doubling block size we will be allowing double the amount of transactions as today, not back towards the beginning of bitcoin.
For your logic to stand you would have to make the case that the total amount of economic activity on chain for Bitcoin is insignificant since that's how much we doubling capacity by if we fork to 2MB.
Anything can be claimed as "insignificant" given adequate perspective.  Doesn't change the reality of doubling capacity at a time when that's needed.

You can split your investment into larger buys over a shorter time frame when dollar cost averaging, but you are just adjusting the risk profile of your investment.  If you buy in over a month time frame, if after that month bitcoin is above where it started and never goes below then shortening your dollar cost average window was a good move, if your whole investment is in and then after that month Bitcoin dips heavily it's likely long term you would have been better overall had you dollar cost averaged less for a longer time period.  The point is nobody knows the future so nobody can say if dollar cost averaging will outperform just investing it all at a single point.  Longer term DCA will be less risky overall but has the chance to miss out on potential profits.  You remove risk as you DCA more often and over a longer period of time, the best is if you bought all at once at the very bottom of your investment time period, the worst is obviously buying all at the very top.
Buying Bitcoin will always increase your Bitcoin holdings, the question is always by how much and maximizing where possible.
No amount of math can predict the future price movement of Bitcoins and therefore can't give a computation at ideal DCA-ing strategy.  Splitting your investment into more often buys over a longer time frame will remove risk at the expense of potential profits, it's up to each individual to choose their risk appetite and plan accordingly.
You could "DCA" your whole investment into 2 buys instead of 1, this will only lower risk slightly at the expense of missed profit had you made the full investment on the buy at the lower price, or you could invest a tiny amount every minute in perpetuity and it would mostly smooth out any risk in timing your investments, leaving your investment gains almost entirely correlated with Bitcoin's overall performance.
Here is a great article about seeking alpha: 
Excerpt: "For all its intricacies, there are ultimately two and only two ways to achieve alpha. It can be had by market timing or by security selection".
Talking about DCAing is just a discussion about how aggressively you want to seek alpha.  Some people are happy with beta and DCA religiously and often, others like to gamble and time their entries hoping to end up with more Bitcoin than they would have otherwise at the risk of ending up with less.
@_date: 2017-08-15 07:09:30
The question doesn't make much sense.  
If you know Bitcoin will only go up then you don't DCA, just single buy ASAP.  DCA is a strategy for unknown future movements with the assumption of an overall upward trend in price with movements up and down along the way.  
Assuming only upward movement in price, DCA is a bad strategy where you will make less BTC than buying as much as can as soon as you can, but if Bitcoin dives in price then later comes back for another ATH you will likely have more BTC using DCA than buying it all right now.  
If you try to time your buys there is higher risk/reward, if you choose well you will end up with more BTC, choose poorly, less.  DCA smooths out the risk and leaves you somewhere in the middle.

Adoption won’t require more hashing, mining secures the network but in theory the current network could run on a tiny fraction of the mining hash work done now and there is nothing that says the increased adoption would require more work to be done.  However if adoption leads to higher prices there will be a monetary incentive for more mining to be done.

In my opinion the best way to keep block sizes low is to signal to would be adopters of the technology for their services that there is major resistance to scale in the future, whereby these services use other technologies and bitcoin continues to enjoy mediocre adoption.
Increasing block size limits isn't about accommodating current transaction levels, but building a system that services and people can use and build upon, knowing they aren't wasting their time.
@_date: 2015-08-03 07:16:53
The exchanges where price discovery happen don't have a supply that matches the Bitcoin protocol, since we are talking about price, the supply on the exchanges must be important as well.
@_date: 2015-08-20 03:42:40
In this scenario (which I'm worried about as well), I think it's unlikely Bitcoin will end.  Instead I'd bet that adoption is throttled.  
This is worse than it sounds, because it's not just the loss of potential adoption at that time.  Much adoption that would have occurred without transaction levels hitting a cap will still try out bitcoin and turn away soured by their experience thereby likely damaging perception of Bitcoin and making further adoption in the future less likely.
In fact a type of adoption throttling could be happening as we speak due to services passing on using the technology for fear that Bitcoin won't be able to support the transactions they require due to highly ambiguous scaling plans.
We need the technology to attract upper layer service providers today in order to create uses for Bitcoin to attract general user adoption tomorrow.
Due to a too small block size limit I bet the end of Bitcoin isn't a dramatic meltdown, but more of a long drawn out whimper, with us never knowing what could have been.
I think it's even more likely that this issue will be figured out eventually though.  It's more a matter of trying to find the optimum set of actions that maximizes future adoption (we will probably hit the target in the middle somewhere).

This appears really interesting and I'm looking forward to trying the game out when it releases.
However I'm a bit confused about it's viability as an investment.  I read through the site and saw the flowcharts involved when users purchase card packs for the game, however I am still unclear what would cause the market price for bitcrystals to rise.  
Are there a fixed number of bitcrystals so that when they are burned for pack purchases there are then fewer left and therefore fewer are burned for future pack purchases which make them more valuable?
Or can EverDreamSoft just create bitcrystals at will?
Either way it's a fun experiment using cryptocurrencies and I bought a small amount to support their efforts.
@_date: 2015-08-03 05:34:11
While I don't necessarily disagree wouldn't that course invite more risk than scaling the limit up over time?  I imagine there are more attack vectors introduced by removing the cap altogether and would make that fork even more contentious than a compromise by raising it in degrees.
@_date: 2015-08-10 22:00:41
I think this is a terrible plan of action.  
There are plenty of companies and individuals looking into to bitcoin now, judging it to see if it will meet various use cases they may need.  These entities will be much less convinced to start pouring resources now into something that "might" scale in the future.
Same goes for markets.  They hate uncertainty and leaving this debate to twist in the wind indefinitely seems like a bad strategy.
Also what if it becomes a self fulfilling prophecy?  Where people don't build services using Bitcoin because they see that it can't handle the too much extra traffic and aren't convinced it will in the near to mid future, and so then the blocks never fill up and we don't ever have to increase the blocksize.  I guess that's one way the issue might be solved...

Let's do off and on chain scaling.  There wasn't consensus for segwit2x, ok fine.  I'm glad we got segwit, now I want modest block size increase, we've had to wait for too long for both.  Segwit should have been merged as soon as it was ready and increase to 2MB blocksize should have been done long ago.  One done how do we get the other now?  
Appears that second layer solutions like LN are in the works and being actively developed so that's good.

101 might be overoptimistic but I think it's better to err on the high side in case there is an adoption explosion.  If Bitcoin fails to achieve high usage rates, whatever happens matters less than if it becomes incredibly popular, so it seems prudent to plan for the upper bound of possibilities.

It is my understanding that segwit blocks don't actually save bandwidth.  So a ~2MB block with segwit or actual block size will have the same centralizing effect based on bandwidth considerations.  Your explanation makes it sound like the fear of 2MB block HF is node centralization and that using segwit instead as a scaling step somehow solves that.  Otherwise seems like a good run down on the situation.

A decentralized currency is one that isn't controlled by a centralized entity.  People "hoarding' the currency don't centralize it.  
No amount of coins owned by an individual can stop me from using the currency.  If there is competition from users to "hoard" bitcoin the only effect it will have is that the trade value of everyone else's bitcoins go up.  
Also nobody will ever be able to own every bitcoin.

I don't disagree but that logic cuts both ways doesn't it?  In the desktop market people choose Windows or Apple because "there are basically 2 choices".  Windows phone and Linux desktop both exist.  From these examples I think we can only conclude that consumers for the most part won't use software because it's open source, but neither will they NOT use software because it's open source.
Just based on that it does leave door open for the possibility for a non-open source Bitcoin type network to thrive and gain market dominance.  However I don't think it's a forgone conclusion that a closed source solution will necessarily win in the end.

Ah OK thanks, I forgot Gavin stepped down as lead a while ago.  
I agree with your assessment and hope some sort of consensus for a block increase happens and is merged with Bitcoin Core.

I like how bitcoins are used in the game.  You can earn them through playing and withdraw them, or pump them back into the game to help speed up your progress.  Very cool mechanic.  Looks like you can't deposit them though so can only use those you've earned in game, thereby avoiding pay to win players, is that right?
@_date: 2018-11-06 09:22:56
It scales down exactly, based on hashrate.  No theory to it.
The question is if miners stop mining or not, if they leave then difficulty adjusts and Bitcoin continues to mint bitcoin and process transactions at roughly the same rate it always does.
There are plenty of things to restrict miners.  There is always an equilibrium reached based on profitability for miners to mine.  As energy to mine becomes scarce it will increase in cost.  Increased energy costs will make bitcoin less profitable and at that point bitcoin mining will decrease.  There aren't more miners right now precisely due to this equilibrium.  Quite frankly we have as many miners as we do now simply because there is enough energy, cheap enough, to support it in relation to price of bitcoins.
Based on this knowledge then, how do you assert Bitcoin will fail due to the energy it consumes?  Or do you not actually have a theory on this and just like to make definitive statements with no substantive backing?
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:24:12
Any kind of adoption helps the bitcoin network.
The more people that learn about bitcoin, find out how to buy and store it... the more the currency will be used over time, you can't force people to use a voluntary currency in a way YOU think is most beneficial, they will use it according to their needs or personal goals.
Frankly if bitcoin was easier to buy, store and spend, more people would likely spend it.  The spending use of bitcoin is an outcome of the technology and environment.  There is continued effort by many to provide products and services that ease all types of use cases for bitcoin.
The best thing you can do is spend bitcoins yourself and help any efforts to make it attractive and easy for others to spend it, not complain about how some people are currently choosing to use it.
@_date: 2018-11-23 22:37:25
Some will stop, difficulty will adjust, the miners left are now profitable again.  It's a self regulating system, it'll never be "too expensive" for miners in general to mine on a long term horizon.

Hard to remember exactly but I feel like the last bear market was long enough that people weren't hanging on the edge of their seats waiting for the next "bull run".
The sentiment surrounding the crash after MtGox collapse seemed quite dire initially, however general outlook on the potential for success was lowest after watching it crash sub $2 from a $32 high.
I've watched about 3-4 major bubble cycles over the years and even though they all had similarities they have all been very different as well.
The only constant in my memory is that general consensus was surprise at each new bull run at time of occurrence.
@_date: 2018-11-06 09:03:14
No it doesn't.  
All you need is "some" mining to run the network, the rest of the hashrate on top of that is superfluous other than fast changes in hashrate due to difficulty change timeframes and amount of security against a 51% attack.
Miners could theoretically drop out continuously at a slow and steady rate down to only a few small miners and the current transaction throughput on the Bitcoin network would be unaffected.
Look into bitcoin mining difficulty for more in depth information.
@_date: 2018-11-12 06:15:27
How?  
FRNs are created via borrowing of money from the fed via bonds.  Bonds are an IOU that require repayment plus interest.  So if every dollar created creates an even greater amount of debt uniformly, that means even all the USD ever created couldn't cover the debt issued to create it in the first place.
If I'm wrong in my understanding of this I'd be interested to learn more.
@_date: 2018-11-06 08:49:21
Can you outline how exactly you see energy consumption making Bitcoin fail?
If economic conditions are such that energy is too costly to consume then less people will mine bitcoins and Bitcoin will continue as it always has without any interruption (though at some level of reduced security relative to any drops in hashrate).

Bitcoin has a lot of uses (ex. asset to hold to hedge against inflation like gold) and is a technology that allows new never before possible things to be built (ex. autonomous agents that can be economic actors).

You can dollar cost average on the way up or down.  If you can pick the tops or bottoms then you don't need to dollar cost average.  The point of it is to trade picking perfect entries and exits for risk mitigation.  
In the given scenario you buy at 8500 in case it bottoms there and reverses, but not with everything so that you have funds if it hits 7500, then at 7500 you do the same thing etc.  If you knew for sure it would hit 6500 then dollar cost averaging would be a terrible strategy and you wouldn't use it.
You could also dollar cost average every $500 change increments with half the amounts, you would then have less risk of missing getting in before bottom hits (risk mitigation) at the cost of more buys at less than optimal prices.
You can make more money nailing the perfect time to buy and sell but will lose bigger if you miss, dollar cost averaging will never yield optimal returns but is a safer strategy overall.

If you consider understanding the improbability of someone breaking SHA256 encryption or somehow building a computer that breaks our understanding of time and space and becoming able to brute force SHA256 key pairs, "speculation", then the substance of the word loses all meaning to be used in the context you are using it for.
You could then say that people are "speculating" that every fiat unit in their bank account won't be stolen by hackers or stolen by the bank itself or destroyed somehow by the controlling government.  Or that they are "speculating" that every invest they could possibly make won't somehow blow up in some extreme edge case disaster scenario.

Can't tell you how many times I heard almost identical comments to this after 2013 crash.  Though they did precede a 2-3 year bear market to be fair.
Hype sets in, bubble forms, price turns parabolic, hype dies, price deflates and bottoms much higher than it started before the rise.  The same charts and comments are recycled.  You hear "this time it's different" to justify the rise, you hear "this time it's different" at the crash in predicting Bitcoin's demise.  It's never really been different yet, though maybe it is this time around, only time will tell.

Why do you think POS would some how keep bitcoins distribution more evenly distributed to lower wealth individuals?  
I won't even get into if that's really desirable or not as a design feature, however many POS schemes reward staked coins with more coins.  Rich people can afford more coins to stake, making even more coins for them and concentrating wealth/power to the rich in the system even faster.
As long as Bitcoin is desirable, rich people will have access to own more than poor people, not much you can do about that for the most part, sorry.  This is how it works for just about everything else as well.
@_date: 2018-02-03 03:41:11
Me too, but if we drop similar to previous crashes after parabolic price rises that seems about in line.  If I were confident it was going that low I'd sell and rebuy... but I stopped trying to time the market a long time ago.  If I was looking to increase my position I'd do it the way you are, good luck, think long term it'll be a good move.
@_date: 2017-10-11 05:19:47
I'm sure you could get into how our brains work, have evolved and are pattern recognition machines, but all attempts at explanations aside, when bitcoin is going up most investors feel that it will keep going up and when going down it will keep going down.  This is why you often see cycles of fear and exuberance in markets.
@_date: 2018-11-06 08:28:24
You're right nobody will buy bitcoin, it's too valuable from all the people buying it.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:14:03
For those that don't want to day trade or try to time the market then yeah, it's times like these that holding is most critical as historically it's holding through the crashes to catch the next hype waves has proven very profitable for people.  It's easy to hold when the price is going up and it's self evident that it's good to have bitcoin while rising, the hard part is holding during the down swings.
The strategy with most potential profit is to time the market well and sell at tops and buy at bottoms but people trying that have ended up timing poorly, usually due to emotional trading, and gotten burned time and time again.  
While less than ideal, holding long term is still a better option than trying to actively trade and mis-timing the market.
If you can spot the trends well and actively buy low and sell high then great, do that, and you'll have a leg up on long term holders, not everyone can do it successfully though and those that don't feel like they can win at that game, based on historical trends, will do best by just holding Bitcoin.
I started in 2010/2011 and did a lot more active trading at the start, after some good calls and bad calls I realized I was playing a dangerous game and would likely end up much worse off in the long run if I continued so I traded much less and mostly held.  I felt pretty dumb after 2013 crash from 1250 to 200 and kind of stopped following things as much during the long crypto winter, however once price came back this last year I was happy that I hadn't panic sold in the last crash.  Who knows where I would have gotten back in at in this last run up.  
Some of my long term price targets were hit during this boom and I took some chips off the table in the 14-17k range.  Looking back it's obvious I would have done better to have sold everything and buy back in now, but hindsight is 20/20.  I'll stick to my long term strategies as they have proven effective for me overall.  Maybe Bitcoin price will never come back and I'll feel bad for missing on profits, maybe it'll come back and I'll feel glad I held rather than trying to predict the trends and price movements, only time will tell.

Correct there is no database of private keys generated.  A common method for choosing a private key is to roll dice or flip a coin choosing a 1 or 0 to get the binary representation of a private key to use.  The only way a used private key like this could be input to a database would be if the person that chose the private key using this method saved the number in said database.
Passwords on wallets provide no extra security to brute forcing private keys, it's only an extra layer of security if someone gains access to your wallet directly so they can't see the private key without the password.  If you told someone your private key they could use it to control your bitcoin in their own wallet and the password wouldn't factor in at all.

If you predict the right trends then dollar cost averaging will always "screw you over", if you don't it will save you money.  You won't know if dollar cost averaging was the "right call" until you can look back at what the price did.  
For many, the peace of mind knowing that while they missed out on some potential profits they didn't have to roll the dice on gambling that they picked perfect entry/exit points make dollar cost averaging an attractive strategy.

Somehow forcing artificial distribution to be egalitarian would be indicative of central control and opposite of decentralization.
The code doesn't care how the coins are distributed, you do it would seem, nothing to do with Bitcoin being a decentralized protocol or not.
Wealth inequality wasn't a problem that Bitcoin was created to solve.  In fact anything that can be bought and is valuable will almost certainly be bought proportionally to current wealth of individuals.  Rich people can afford more of something than poor people and if it's sought after will end up with more of it.
Even with perfectly even initial distribution you would find anything pool towards fewer individuals as time goes on.

While it may not be a scaling panacea as many are hoping, all it has to do is manage some transactions to be a net positive for scaling Bitcoin.  
I agree that other scaling avenues should not be avoided or deemed unnecessary due to the alleged imminent emergence of Lightning network, but similarly let's not trash Lightning in light of a block size increase, seems a bit hypocritical.  Both can help (I guess this is a big assumption as I'm not sure what use cases are a good fit for lightning channels but I imagine there must be some) and should be encouraged since they aren't mutually exclusionary.  
I personally would rather see resources go towards a larger block size implemented before Lightning network, but I see no reason to argue against Lightning being created at all.

Bitcoin is the protocol.  Services offering what you describe can and likely will be built on top of it.  I'm not sure if makes sense to compare how "digital solutions" for other currencies are much more "advanced" than Bitcoin.  Though it's true that Bitcoin services will likely become much more advanced in the future.

Oh I think ideally the block size increase to at least 2MB should have been done years ago when things first started heating up with Theymos, Gavin, Hearn etc.  
Similarly I think segwit should have been implemented as soon as it was ready as well.
Segwit has a positive impact on transaction throughput and fixes other things and paves the way for Lightning to be added when ready, seems all good and technically it shouldn't impact on chain scaling (other than it's multiplicative effect with direct block size increases that can be accounted for anyway) as both can be implemented without conflict as I understand it.

The bear market of 2014 felt very similar to this one has so far, it just dragged on for 3 years.  Nobody knows what will happen, how long the bear market will last or if it will ever reach ATHs again.  The good news is that whatever you'd like to happen, you'll be able to find validation in someone predicting exactly that will happen.

Hopefully some concentrated pockets spring up in multiple locations and communities.  These would be great social experiments that would be implemented in different ways.  The data collected from them would only help strengthen the overall network and assist future communities in potentially utilizing Bitcoin (or help them to avoid certain pitfalls).

I agree however another point to keep in mind is not just the absolute size of the network lending it value but also the density.  If a small town all had its residents using Bitcoin it would likely be much more useful for each member there than for the rest of us abroad.  Because Bitcoin is global it's possible we may need to see a lot of growth before network density reaches a critical mass of usefulness to its users.

Exactly Bitcoin is the protocol.  Voluntary centralized services layered over it say nothing about the decentralized nature of the protocol itself.  It's like lamenting that web sites requiring authentication or enacting kyc/aml practices is somehow ironic or detrimental to the http protocol serving up the internet's content.
A protocol that allows both centralized and decentralized services to be built on it and that can be as anonymous or transparent as desired by its users is a strength.

I've followed quantum computing for a long time and yes have read about the recent reporting from Divesh Aggarwal and others that have estimated that ASIC chips will maintain speed advantage over quantum computing using a Grover search for at least 10 years and that it's not likely Bitcoin's elliptic curve signature scheme will be broken by Shor's algorithm until 2027.
Even with quantum computing there are some protections in place to protect my bitcoin, here is a excerpt from one of the publications:
"This appears to expose a vulnerability, but in fact there are several safeguards built into Bitcoin which prevent this. Firstly, public keys are not revealed by your address. The Bitcoin protocol generates addresses by putting the public key through SHA-256 and then through RIPEMD-160. Since the public key is only revealed when the Bitcoins are spent, it becomes vulnerable to an attack by a quantum computer only after the public key is revealed in a transaction."
In the next decade there will be plenty of time to upgrade to a more quantum resistant algorithm for Bitcoin.
These quantum machines would also break the SSL protecting my bank account logins.  By your logic everyone that has money in a bank account is "speculating" that quantum computing won't surface that breaks their security and steal their money, which in my opinion is a very dumb/poor argument.  There are speculative aspects to investing in crypto, quantum computing isn't part of that.  Interesting subject though.

This argument has no value unless you qualify it.
I think we can assume you think block sizes of 1MB are sufficiently small to allow for "acceptable" levels of decentraliztion.  Graph out the block size where "all mining power ends up in one physical location" over time as technology advances.  Overlay this line graph with the one showing block size limit if BIP101 is merged, do the 2 lines ever intersect?  If not then why even bring up mining power ending up in one physical location if nobody is proposing a plan that leads there?
I have the same frustration with people that argue "global warming" the same way.  It doesn't matter if it "exists" or not but precisely how fast it will affect the environment and to what severity (note I'm not saying that it isn't a problem, just how the argument is made when discussing it with many people).
Can you make a compelling argument that 8MB blocks (for simplicity we can assume all blocks are full for sake of argument) on 2016-01-11 will lead to enough miner centralization that it critically endangers Bitcoin?
How about an argument that bandwidth speeds and storage capacity won't advance in proportion to the increase of block size limit called for in BIP101, along with a determination at which point in time the block size limit will likely adequately surpass node technology capabilities to sufficiently centralize Bitcoin to be a large risk/problem?
I could be wrong but I think 8MB next year won't be a problem and I think technology will advance at a fast enough pace to accommodate the schedule of block size limit increases, however I'd gladly reverse my support for BIP101 or other similar block increase plans given a good reason to believe either of the above scenarios are likely.

A unit to unit comparison makes little sense without the context of supply for each currency.  Someone could make a shitty clone coin with very few highly divisible units and it would probably perform even better in the same comparison while at the same time being fairly worthless on the whole.
Though I was around when bitcoins dropped to $2 so if your point is that bitcoins are doing alright price wise in the grand scheme of things then I don't disagree.  I have other investments with expectations of getting a return, for me Bitcoin is a wildcard that is fun to track and continually learn more about.
@_date: 2015-04-09 08:09:45
"Better" depends on what you want from Bitcoin.  If all you want from it is a storage of value (or nothing at all) then spending BTC and therefore helping increase the overall utility value of the network might not mean much.
Think of it like voting.  If you believe everyone should vote and it's a good system, you should really start by voting yourself.  Though that is a poor analogy because with Bitcoin the very act of spending BTC positions you as a participant in the transactional network as well as encouraging others to do the same.
The more people spending BTC regularly means the network has more active participants likely setup with the infrastructure and experience to send and receive it with potential peers.
The more people spending BTC the more BTC economic activity present to help support merchants to accept it.
Ideally these numbers grow large enough that I can use BTC to instantly trade value with my friends, family, business partners and other acquaintances ubiquitously as well as spending it at virtually all merchants.  Will this happen eventually?  Nobody knows, but we do know that for it to happen it will require people to make the choice to use BTC at every step of growth until the requisite level of adoption is reached. 
@_date: 2015-09-04 19:23:14
The fact that there is, for all intents and purposes, virtually unlimited POTENTIAL demand to transact on the bitcoin network isn't an argument not to increase it's capabilities as much as possible now.
I agree that we should set up Bitcoin to be capable to handle as many on-chain transactions as possible and I also agree that technologies like lighting network will be critical and necessary in the future if Bitcoin adoption is as successful as most people around here hope for.
7 billion people won't start using Bitcoin now, but let's extend the on ramp in the short term to maximize the support for as many users/services to transact as possible as well as pursuing side chains and lightning type networks aggressively.
@_date: 2015-09-09 07:14:34
I realize my mistake.  I assumed that maximizing adoption of Bitcoin was "the" plan.  Assumptions are bad so sorry for that.
I agree, assuming we don't care about, for example, getting Amazon on board, then yes scaling or coding in plans to scale Bitcoin is not essential and if for some bizarre reason Amazon were to get on board before Bitcoin was ready capacity wise and fill up blocks, then yes there would be greater impetus to increase block size and it would happen faster than without it.
However if we do want to realize maximum potential for Bitcoin to grow, we need to begin scaling it now or code ways for it to scale based on increased transactions otherwise many opportunities will likely pass it by and the technology won't be adopted to the degree it could potentially otherwise.

Bitcoin can even be viewed as a business.  It is the first decentralized autonomous company.  
Bitcoins provides a service in that it provides value transfer services and record keeping.  It even pays its expenses to miners for security.  Though to be fair, buying Bitcoin tokens aren't the same as owning part of the Bitcoin company and is instead speculating on value of assets of the company.  But I would argue that not all speculation is gambling unless you broaden the definition of gambling to encompass all investments.
These types of arguments just seem to boil down to semantics.  Investopedia says the difference between investing and speculating is based on the risk involved, but there is no way to quantify the risk involved in investing in Bitcoin so in that sense it comes down to your perspective on how much risk is involved I guess.
@_date: 2018-04-11 21:55:06
You can look at it one of two ways:
1) We've hit capitulation, found a bottom and sentiment is turning positive preceding an upward trend in price.
2) The positive sentiment shows we haven't reached full despair and capitulation required to bottom out and so more downward price movements are in our future.
3) This is crypto and it's not following the classic bubble / boom bust cycles people have made countless diagrams and charts of.
@_date: 2015-09-08 08:18:49
Or maybe a big player that would otherwise have adopted/integrated bitcoin will pass on it because they realize it doesn't have the necessary capacity and don't see a clear path to scaling in the future.
Planning on large entities to enter the game in a meaningful enough way that pushes use enough to fill blocks seems like a poor strategy.  Are we hoping that they don't do their research?  Or that they are dumb enough to cripple the network in hopes that it will THEN push scaling through to hopefully fix things?
In this scenario I believe the tail does wag the dog a lot more than you think.

If you go for it, trade with a small percentage of your btc stack.
Swing trade in a range with pairs after watching the swing range for a bit, be patient during flat times and don't go chasing trades outside the range you've observed.
If you gamble on ICOs or new small market cap coins just remember that investment carries a lot of risk, i would diversify and use very small portions of portfolio.  I did very well investing in ICOs during 2017 but most of my investments went nowhere and were made up for by a couple winners, I just got lucky I made some good picks that easily wiped out any losses on my other trades.
If you like the technicals on certain alts and that drives you're decision to buy them, buy and hold long term, short term price doesn't correlate well to a coins technology.  Something you think is awesome with a great concept, team and execution may keep a low value for a long time while hyped up white papers crush it price wise in the short term.
Don't look for a mentor or training course or listen to anyone you know in person or on the internet for sound advise to follow.

Bitcoin is a network of users.  The value of a network is often thought to increase exponentially as participants in the network increase.  First mover advantage has a huge effect on the number of participants of the Bitcoin network in comparison to other crypto networks.  Ergo first mover advantage directly contributes to providing Bitcoin more value.  The best messaging app in the world is worthless with only one user.  Tech is important but there are a lot of variables when determining value and price for cryptos.  Don't get stuck on one thing and think it means everything.

Of all the problems and challenges that Bitcoin faces, this isn't one of them.
I'd be willing to bet the 5.1% (going off someone elses math) inflation will out pace the amount of coins lost this year.
In the future more coins may be lost than mined, however Bitcoin can be infinitely divisible so same amount of Bitcoin will just be worth more (all other variable staying equal).

You say "If we see a sudden surge in traffic (from Amazon, for instance), it will be quite obvious that an increase makes sense, so we will increase the blocksize." as if that's a likely scenario that Amazon would make an integration with Bitcoin knowing it couldn't handle the capacity they would bring.  This is you "planning on a large entity to enter the game in a meaningful enough way that pushes use enough to fill blocks".  Can you explain more how I'm not understanding what you are saying?


The reason to increase the blocksize is to position the technology so that new users/start-ups/services as well as larger established companies have a platform they can actually use.
Whether it's a new idea being built from the ground up or a massive company making a major integration with bitcoin, it's going to cost a lot of resources for them to pull off.  Why would those resources be spent if the "success" scenario leads to breaking the very technology they are trying to build on?
I'll try not to get my hopes up that block size limits will increase before the network is fully congested, but if that's the path taken then I think it will be a mistake.
The thought that Amazon (or someone similar) would adopt the technology to that degree BEFORE the technology is capable of handling their capacity is borderline insanity.  So if we want someone like Amazon on board we need to work towards fixing Bitcoin capacity issues now or it likely just won't ever come.

Bitcoin is a voluntary currency.  If people value it enough to hoard (i.e. save) then how is that a bad thing?  
People will choose why Bitcoin is valuable to them and how they want to use it.  If Bitcoin finds a way to be a more efficient or useful method of value transfer than other currencies then it will be used for those reasons, such as through autonomous agents etc.
Bitcoin is still a social experiment.  Maybe some will use it as gold 2.0, some as an investment vehicle and maybe some technologies will use it as programmable money.  It doesn't have to replace all fiat currencies and support a global economy to be a success.

Alt coins offer greater upside potential balanced by extra risk.  They are the penny stocks of crypto.  
Nothing wrong with taking extra risk for extra potential gains as long as people understand what they are getting into.
During 2017 I chose to take a part of my bitcoin holdings and invest in a number of ICOs.  A good number of those investments went nowhere and would have been better left in Bitcoin, however the ones that took off gave me gains far exceeding the losses on the losers.  I probably just got lucky so don't take this as investing advice.  
Determining appetite for risk is something every investor needs to determine for themselves.  There are no right answers here.

I've used QuickPay quite a bit and am glad it's an option for sending money, however I only use it after verifying my recipient also banks with Chase.  There have been numerous occasions where they don't and then the process of getting them cash is much more onerous.  
Each time this happens it highlights to me how awesome it would be if the Bitcoin network grew large enough to be truly useful for these types of transactions where most of the people I know and do business with either use it or it's become well known enough and developed enough easy to use services where sending bitcoin to virtually anyone is a viable solution.
Currently I'm interested in Bitcoin for it's technical merits, social/economic implications and it's potential but hopefully some day it or some other similar technology will realize that potential.  I hold out some hope for a future with the proliferation of cryptocurrency, DACs, self-driving cars, 3d printing, assurance contracts, mesh-networking, the matter net etc etc.  I think all these technologies could have great synergy and makes me excited for the future.

I don’t see a fallacy of scarcity.  Other cryptocurrencies are not fungible with bitcoin.  Currencies are networks and much of their value lies in their network effect, use will pool to one or few cryptocurrencies for the most part in the end.  Also your previous point was the difficulty of effecting core change in the bitcoin protocol which runs counter to your supposition that “the core can be changed to release more coins”.  While technically true it’s highly unlikely enough participants will come to consensus to make such a change.
Time will tell on your other points and there is potential for calamity but so far POW for bitcoin has kept the network running and secure.  The project has also retained high quality developers that continue to work to refine and improve bitcoin in a very decentralized way (no central authority pays for majority of marketing or development), which can’t be said for many other crypto projects.

The supply isn't drying up, it's just increasing at ever lower rates.  You still need more demand to drive up price, just with lower rates of increasing supply it takes less increases in demand to drive up price.
Stable demand, even with lowering rates of monetary inflation, will result in lower prices, not higher.
Maybe if at some point "burned" or lost bitcoins outpace newly mined coins this effect you are describing may come into effect as supply over time will go down in this case.
If demand for bitcoins "used" them up (made them no longer usable), then also yes, flat demand would drive up prices as new supply decreased over time, this is not the case with bitcoins though.
Edit: You may be right in the cases where demand is by people wishing to hold bitcoin indefinitely since these bitcoins are essentially removed from circulation, not the case for demand in general though since much demand may be for active trading or use.

That's a good question.  I've spent and cashed out a small amount along the way.  Unfortunately I don't own enough bitcoins where I see a point in the near future where I could cash a big portion out and have it significantly improve my quality of life (semi-retire, pay off mortgage etc.).

I disagree, either way you are buying BTC.  Whether you buy with BTC or USD is irrelevant.  You count the BTC cost when purchasing a miner (regardless of currency used).  If it returns more BTC than the BTC value you paid then it was a good investment and method to acquire BTC.  If not you chose a sub-optimal method for acquiring your BTC and therefore made a bad investment considering options available to you after deciding to invest in BTC.
BTC/USD currency speculation =/= to BTC miner investment.  I think lumping 2 separate investment decisions into one confuses people and allows justification for poor investments.

The only way it makes sense to me is if by "less Bitcoins" he means less bitcoins for sale on exchanges assuming these miners would have bought BTC there instead of using their money to buy miners that will cost them more per BTC.
So 10k goes to a miner pre-order and that means it doesn't go on to an exchange and drive up the price meaning lower prices for him to purchase at, for example.
Though the wording is a bit strange if that was his point.

Sure, like I said bitcoin isn't ready for general use yet.  There will be some niche markets and groups of users that do use it as a currency, but mostly for now it will be used as a speculative instrument.  This will continue until bitcoin is easy enough and provides tangible benefits to use by most people.
I think it's hasty to write off bitcoin as a currency before it's developed enough to be attractive to be used as a currency.
The interest and infrastructure is building, it's anyone's guess if it will continue to a point where it's picked up for mainstream use.

I don't find "intrinsic value" to be a good argument when discussing major merits of bitcoin vs gold.  Assuming intrinsic value means gold has uses and value as jewelery and an industrial material etc, all this means is there is a slightly higher floor than 0 if it's value as a store of wealth and transactional currency goes away.  That's it?  That's the big advantage of gold, if it flops AND you continue hold it while it's price nose dives toward nothing then you're left with a small fraction of your wealth rather than none of it?

I believe that currently Bitcoin is not ready for mainstream adoption.  If I had to guess we are still 1-3 years off from there assuming resources continue to be poured into it.  Hardware wallets for security and abstracting away keys are a must first step to non tech enthusiast adoption.
I've been very excited about the Oculus Rift (virtual reality headset) these last few months and I see some parallels between the 2 projects.  Both can be bought and used now, but neither seem to be ready for prime time yet.  Infrastructure is being built and the technology is being developed and improved in both cases.
Can't wait to see what 2014 and 2015 brings us.

You can't trust what the company says.  Customer service is awful.  The products you buy will end up generating less BTC than you pay for them (or the BTC value of the USD you pay for them).
If you want a product that will lose you money, take an indeterminable time to be delivered, locks you into your purchase with no refunds regardless of how long it takes to get shipped and creates a relationship with a company that has disdain for it's own customers, then buying from BFL is the choice for you.

One year ago was a ASTOUNDINGLY good time to be acquiring BTC.  Mining as a method of acquiring BTC is only a good investment if better than the other options for BTC acquisition.  I haven't done the research but would 5k in mining equipment one year ago have netted you more BTC than purchasing it outright?  If not then the only good decision here would be to get BTC, not necessarily to mine.
In short, don't count on spiking exchange rates to justify mining investments.

**Use as Day-to-Day Currency:**
Bitcoin isn't ready to be used as a day to day currency for the general public, so I guess I don't have any issue with what you say here.
**Use as Investment/Lending:**
Some people only care about increasing their holdings in terms of bitcoins.  Lending in BTC makes sense for these people.  You see the same for some miners where the point is to increase their mining profitability in regards to BTC in VS BTC out.
If what you really care about is the USD value of your bitcoins then set the lending terms in USD valuation.  Not sure where the problem here is really.
**Backed By USD**
I have the biggest issue with this part, it's not backed by USD.  
BTC isn't backed by anything, period.
For now while volatility is high and adoption is low people are still going to price things in their head in fiat terms since that is what they are used to and is easier for now.
If the BTC economy grows big enough the volatility should flatten out and increased commerce in BTC will make pricing things in BTC more natural and comfortable.  It'll be a process that happens over time much like transacting in mBTC rather than BTC.  We are at the very early stages here so I wouldn't expect many people to think of prices in purely BTC terms for a long time to come.
**Speculation Delusion:**
Historically speculation in bitcoin has been massively profitable long term regardless of short term price swings up and down.  Of course this doesn't conclusively predict that that is what will continue to happen in the future, but helps explain the tendency for irrational exuberance at times.
Talking about falsifiable models in regards to speculation is fairly ridiculous.  I think most investors realize there is significant risk involved but judge the upside potential to be worth the perceived risk.
Any speculation on the future is only falsifiable in principal but not in practice.

Why would that reflect poorly on them?  I mean this would be in addition to allowing customers to pay through their current methods right?  Why would a consumer look down on a company for expanding their payment methods?  Bitcoin goes to zero ... stop accepting bitcoin, no harm no foul.  If anything I'd think it would give them an image of being agile and contemporary regardless of bitcoin's future.
Not saying your wrong.  Consumers think all sorts of stupid things for stupid reasons, just can't seem to connect the dots here in any sort of logical way.  
I've never personally looked down on any company for giving their customer more options while taking none away.

The first time employees saw transactions made in Bitcoin, not knowing what the hell Bitcoin was, the reaction was "wow, that was fast, is that it?".
Most likely more BTC transactions wouldn't be bad since they are usually quick and won't hold up lines.  However what really matters most to merchants are more sales regardless of how they are paid for.
As a quick aside slow internet can make for a very painful Bitcoin transaction experience.  After some tests with customers I've had to sideline offering bitcoin payments until I can get better connection speed, though running Bitcoin through the store smartphone with 3g cell service was very slick and fast so the speed barrier is pretty low and pretty much any dedicated internet service should work well.

The powerful ideas in bitcoin will become apparent to everybody once they begin to be implemented regardless of how many see it currently.

Strong reactions to bad ideas before they take hold will "kill" bitcoin?  I disagree.
Keeping bitcoins with as much utility for as many people as possible will only help in the long run.  Plus I don't see many dumping their BTC just because there is a strong reaction to the possibility of something shitty coming down the pipe.
Let the CoinValidation hate spam reign.  Most seem united in their contempt for the concept so I don't really see the big split a select few seem to.

I was trying to find a small silver lining for you but now from their newsletter it sounds like they may not have things up for you guys until mid next week, sorry.

Haven't heard of Diceware but I believe Bitaddress uses mouse movements and other input to introduce entropy to the keys it creates.
I think the idea is that based on all the factors they use to randomize the keys generated it's essentially impossible for the same to be created twice.
Then again I'm no crypto expert and I haven't reviewed the bitaddress code myself.

Yes both major exponential rises in price in Bitcoin's history were followed by large crashes that bottomed out above the previous run-up's high point.  Then months of up and down trends inside a channel between the latest and previous to that high points.  Then eventually another run up in price again that breaks the last ATH.
I can't imagine any of this is surprising to those that have been watching since 2011.
If we drop below 266 then this boom bust cycle will deviate from previous cycles and I might be a bit concerned.
However the most important thing is that there is more attention on Bitcoin than ever before (11k+ reading this reddit right now!).  This means more developers and more VC investment capital which in turn leads to a likely stronger Bitcoin in the future.
For each rapid rise in price, people see a large influx of speculators, what is less obvious is the influx of other types attracted to bitcoin as well.
@_date: 2013-12-25 04:23:54
Hate to be cynical but many of the posters you are talking about not only already know this but have been banking on it for a long time now.
The best you can do is encourage people to study the price history if they want to engage in trading.  
The manic boom upwards followed by the sickening plummet cycle has happened numerous times already and is most likely exacerbated by those trying to capitalize on it.
It is why you see so many people here suggest buy and hold strategies.

Only had them process a few physical transactions for my business but all my dealings with them have been great to date.
The merchant tools are easy to load, use and train staff on, if a bit simplistic.

Using an iPad POS with SalesVu software (similar to Square, been very happy with this POS software incidentally).  Was hoping to use an Android tablet but because of the various form factors it was more difficult to find solid, theft proof stands for them to be used at the counter.
Orders are first rung up on SalesVu to get order total, then that total is input to the BitPay merchant site for QR code scanning.  Afterwards the order in SalesVu *could* be zeroed out with the employee then turning the machine at the prompt for tips.  However this sucks for both customer and employee, not to mention enters zero dollar orders to the ledger cluttering it up.  
Payment should be presented to customer through a single interface.  It would be much more natural to have employees sign into sub accounts on BitPay before launching the merchant portal site, then let BitPay track tips given to employees so that before payroll I could track USD tips left for each employee to be added to their paycheck.
In fact the whole process will continue to be a bit clumsy until we can get BTC processors integrated as payment options into the various POS software itself.

Personally I think as far as mainstream usage goes we are just not there yet.  Assuming things progress as hoped I believe we are still at least a couple years out.
I've done a fair bit of desktop support over the years and many users seem to have a tenuous grasp on how to work a computer in general, even those that use them every day as the primary tool to do their job.
For much of the population 2 things have to happen before they will use bitcoin as a currency:
1) More infrastructure needs to be built to abstract away the complexities of bitcoins.  No more keys or wallet address management etc.
2) Enough *other* people/business must already be using bitcoins.  Many will never take the time to learn the technical or social benefits bitcoins might bring to the table.  They will use them not only because they work, but because they see them working for those close around them.  The majority don't want to be pioneers, disruptive or unique, but to conform to the societal norms they feel are accepted or even expected of them.  Enough people using bitcoins will trigger most of the rest to feel comfortable trusting it without even really knowing what it is or how it works.
In essence I don't think the majority will ever have a clear view of bitcoins, only that they see people using it and that they can use it too by pressing big easy buttons then money is transferred or things are payed for.  Hell most people don't even know the FED isn't a government agency.
As others have said there is a chance that in the future people might use bitcoins and not even know it as they will interface with services layered over the bitcoin protocol rather than deal with bitcoin itself.

You're right, we can agree to disagree.  I'm only "arguing" because I disagree with you, not in some attempt imply any kind of superiority over anyone.
You see a lot of people justify investments in mining based on increasing value of BTC.  I think your line of thinking enables investors to justify poor decisions.  Push comes to shove I don't really care that much, people can do whatever they want with their money and I won't be too heart broken over people mining at a loss to beef up the bitcoin network.
Maybe it is mostly semantics in your mind but I believe the decision to invest in BTC and what the USD value of that BTC will be in the future is a completely separate decision process than the decision on how to go about obtaining those BTC.  You can make a good decision on the first and a bad one for the latter and still come out ahead in terms of USD, but that doesn't mean the latter decision was a good one.

Ironically it was Dan that made the statement with absolutes.  Assigning 100% surety to something that can't be known for sure 100% should be left to priests and other magic men.  It has no business here and that is what people are speaking out against.
Of course it doesn't mean that Dan is "useless" and can't contribute to the field in the future.  It does however hurt his credibility to a certain extent which is a shame considering how many people respect him and his opinion.
People are judged by what they do and what they say.  He made a false statement and is being judged for it.  That doesn't mean of course that this one statement will solely be used to judge the measure of this man.  Or it shouldn't at least.

Rather than try to figure out what intrinsic value BTC has, I think it's more accurate to acknowledge that nothing has intrinsic value.
The theoretical possible "floor" price for anything is 0.  You are left only with probabilities for various scenarios but no fundamental difference between gold, USD or Bitcoin in that respect.

It's ridiculous that people are holding a company to a standard that that company themselves set in order to garner orders in the first place?
Your post seems to boil down to chastising customers for feeling "entitled" to having a company follow what they promised.
It's amazing how much sympathy this company gets.  When other companies promise something, don't deliver many times over, and the customers get screwed, they usually rightfully get lambasted and rarely do people crawl out of the woodwork bending over backward to defend them.
The next time BitInstant or Coinbase takes peoples' money and doesn't deliver the bitcoins for months on end and we get the inevitable threads full of upset angry customers that lost large sums of money due to whatever company not following through on their stated promise, I'll expect your passionate defense of the company and statement about how ridiculous it is for these people to be pissed off.  Of course this analogy would be even better if the amount of BTC you got for the USD paid from these types of companies went down the longer it took for them to give it to you...
All this stands without even mentioning the treatment customers get from the "PR" of this company.
Disclosure: I don't have a BFL pre-order.  I skimmed the first threads about them when their FPGA product declaration was discovered and realized then this wasn't a company I wanted to do business with.  The drama is good for a chuckle here and there though.

If the only way to recoup your costs is to sell the device to the bigger fool then nobody "downstream" is likely recouping their costs.  You're complicating something pretty simple.  Calculate the number of BTC a miner will generate and if that is higher than the price paid then it will be a net negative profit device for the mining community.
If a miner costs you 100btc and will only generate 90btc it doesn't matter how many times it's sold downstream it's still a losing investment overall.  Anyone that makes profit off the miner is doing so at the expense of whoever is the bag holder at the bottom of the "stream".
If at the "highest-level mining equipment" you are FINALLY profitable that says you weren't profitable at any "level" below that.  So why would losing money at every level help you attain the highest level and finally be profitable?  Your complex MLM theory of how mining works is nonsense at it's core.
If a miner wasn't profitable than you aren't simply "working up capital".  In fact continually buying unprofitable miners is a great way of working DOWN capital.

Trouble with a home refinance is not surprising at all.  Lenders will change the rules and essentially make things up not to lend you money, the fact that guy was in porn just gave them an easy excuse.
When I refinanced, my mortgage broker told me I was an excellent candidate based on all the metrics they used to determine eligibility (debt to income, credit, equity in the property, etc etc).  The process got stalled or I was denied by lender after lender, finally found one lender that actually wanted to lend eventually.
As a "perfect" candidate it took almost 6 months and 4 lenders to get the process done for a cheap property and I work in IT rather than porn.

Isn't value judged subjectively and therefore cannot be inherent of anything?
Bitcoins are valuable to some people for many reasons.  If I became interested in bitcoins and wanted some for whatever reason why would I avoid it due to fluctuating price in the past?  
I think we are still far, protocol development as well as infrastructure wise, from having something that could have mass appeal to the general public.  We may never get there.  If we do bitcoins will be worth a lot more than they are now.  In between the price will go up and down based on speculation and will be adopted by those that discover they have a use for it as it develops and hopefully becomes more useful over time.
I guess my point is that price history isn't the only determining factor for adoption consideration by everyone.  If your only goal is to make USD then yeah I wouldn't recommend buying and holding BTC while in a downtrend.

If widespread acceptance and adoption of Bitcoin happens, I don't believe it will be in 2014.
I do think that the massive exposure given to Bitcoin during the last run-up will lead to further increased resources invested in development of code and other infrastructure for Bitcoin and it's related services.  It is the product of these redoubled efforts that might lead to an easy to understand and utilize Bitcoin in 2015 or 2016 (with more and more merchants signing up along the way).
Just a guess of course, and I even if things happen the way I imagine I still have no clue how the price of bitcoins would correlate.
Even though I don't feel like Bitcoin is anywhere near close to be used by the general public in large numbers, I'm still massively optimistic/bullish on it's future in general.

From reading their book I gather that what they do best is fit theories to explain potentially surprising or unexpected trends extrapolated from large data sets.
I hope they are able to scrape much data from merchants, services and the blockchain if they do weigh in with their thoughts.  I'm sure they could make it interesting if they decide they care enough.
I'd be most interested on the effect they see in merchant/service purchases and transaction volume as a ratio of price movements over time and their theories of how this applies to the effect of price inflation and deflation in an economy.

How are they "getting stiffed"?
At any moment a bitcoin is worth what the market decides it's worth.  An early adopter can buy a bitcoin for the same price as a late adopter.  By your "peanuts" logic I then assume you'll never invest in anything that has a history of rising value, wouldn't want to give anything up for peanuts right?
Bitcoin's value resides mainly in it's network of participants and infrastructure.  Anyone can make a clone and own it for cheaper than bitcoin, but only because it's less valuable due to having less utility.  
In this future you propose, the poor countries can enter the bitcoin market for the same price anyone else can.  Limiting trade voluntarily to only other poor countries is a great way for them to stay poor, and they don't need to create new currencies to enter into trade agreements with each other.
You need to explain why this less useful new currency they create will provide more value to these countries than adopting a current "virtual" currency with more utility (or just keeping their standard fiat currency).
I'm not even sure why you are talking about countries as bitcoin market participants as it is a voluntary currency more likely to be used by individuals within countries rather than countries themselves.  Countries have their own currencies already.

Probably good to stay away if you can't stand the volatility, I don't think that's going away any time soon.
As for use as a currency, it's still beta and not anywhere close to being user friendly.  Currently it takes a non-trivial amount of time to figure out all the nuances to create wallets and store and spend bitcoins.  Most people don't have the interest or time to invest in it and so will not use bitcoins.
This spike in price brought more attention and dollars to bitcoin, this is what will continue to help push bitcoin development for the months and years to come.  
Give it some time, if you think it's ready for use now by the general public, you're going to have a bad time.

Depends how many you buy and what you plan to do with them.  Large amounts of coins are probably best kept in cold storage, also best if you don't plan to speculate or spend the coins.
For $30 worth you might want them in a hot wallet if you think you might spend them or pass them around / experiment a bit.
