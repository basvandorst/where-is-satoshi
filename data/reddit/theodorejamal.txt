Putting aside the absurd political theater gripping Venezuela at this time, how exactly would this type of crypto work? The “perto” will supposedly be backed by national oil reserves. But those fluctuate based on international trade agreements, geopolitical contingencies, investment in exploration, not to mentioned unforeseen social conditions? I assume petro reserves are moving in the downward direction  given the lack of an infinite amount of dead dinosaurs et al. So, how would this work in regards to currency?

CC the president, provost, and any other people you think are relevant. Remember, the purpose of the email is to document the event. Describe in detail the incident and request they de blacklist you. If you don't hear anything in 24 hrs call your loca newspaper and try to get them to run a story on this, with all the news about bitcoin lately I'm sure they would jump on the opportunity to get some national coverage.  Once the article is out lawyers will likely contact you offering their services. Don't surrender your computer to them, that is beyond reasonable.

Don't keep large amounts on exchanges like kraken or coinbase. They control the private keys so you don't actually own your coins, more like IOUs. 
Personally I don't leave anything on an exchange for more than 5 minutes. 
Electrum is a good PC wallet. Truth is, any wallet that lets you control your private keys (often in the form of a 12 word recovery phrase) is wayyyy more secure than trusting a third party like kraken or coinbase, especially if you plan to hold and not day trade cryptos, which can be risky w/o experience in the space. 
Edit: final point: coinbase has notoriously slow/automated customer service. Usually takes months to get a response. And, Kraken is based in Japan FYI. Not that that's a bad thing, but ya know, Uncle Sam know s no bounds.

well, that is news to me.
From Coinbase's website:
"As Coinbase is a hosted wallet, it's not feasible to provide the private keys to individual wallet addresses; doing so would prevent us from taking advantage of our secure cold-storage technology to protect your funds. This not only ensures your security but it also allows us to reduce the cost of sending digital currency to another Coinbase account. 
You can always find and create new addresses to be associated with your Coinbase wallet on your Addresses page.
For advanced use, customers may take advantage of the Coinbase Multisig Vault to maintain full control of your keys. In the event that Coinbase was inaccessible for any reason, you could use the Multisig recovery tool to retrieve the funds."
The number of complaints i've read re: issues when trying to move funds from the "vault" to the "hotwallet" is too high to count.

You should send all you btc to another wallet. Then, enter an incorrect # into your nano s 3 x, which will wipe the nano s. At that point start reset process, record the 24 word seed, after which , send the coins back to your "new" nano s wallet. And stash your seed phrase somewhere safe! 
Also, due to network congestion, you might want to think about waiting till you get confirmations on each transfer as you proceed. You don't want to close your wallet, after thinking you sent all its contents  to a different wallet, and, later, find out you paid a low fee and the btc were in limbo for over 2 weeks and, as a result, were returned to an address you no longer have access to.

When you backup a wallet you get the seed phrase, which is a combination of randomly generated words. Usually 12 words. These words are how you restore access to wallets. If you backed up the wallet it should have shown you your seed phrase and you should have written it down on a piece of paper for situations like this.

You store bitcoin publicly on the blockchain. It is not a bank. It is a decentralized ledger that has thousands of copies all over the world. One goes down many others are there to take over.

If your electricity is included in rent, I expect your landlord will come a asking when the power bill skyrockets. Lol, do you have a contract?

Hardware wallet is best most secure bet. Also, note that bitcoin is not actually stored in a wallet. It is logged into the public blockchain. The most common way to access it is with a wallet, kinda like a key. There are lots of wallets. Hardware wallets are the most secure because you need to have physical access to one to send coins. Read up on the top picks: trezor, ledger nano s and keep key. That said, anybody with your back up 12-24 word seed can get access to your coins in the blockchain so keep that super safe. If you loose or damage a hardware wallet your bitcoin can be recovered with the backup words. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 05:31:25

Backup words are your private key. Coins are stored on blockchain not in the devise. With pass phrases you can access coins on other wallets or other hardware devises.

The difference is you need to physically hold a hardware wallet to access the blockchain. That is why they "unhackable." 
You can wipe your hardware and back it up with the 24 word seed and it will be good as new.
It offers an extra layer of security when authorizing a transaction. That's the main benefit. Nonetheless with the word seed anybody can access your coins. Best keep private keys in a safe deposite box.

In the early 1940s Walter Benjamin turned to a 1920s painting by Paul Klee to make sense of the chaos Europe was experiencing.   Klee's Angel of History inspired him to describe the image as a metaphor of history writing: 
"His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. The storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress." 
As far as I am concerned, this is a good description of the times we live ;)

Keeping coins on ledger nano s is safe where a fork to occur. With the 24 word pass code you would be able  access either side of a chain post fork.

Keys generated after a fork only work on the chain they are generated on. Keys generated before a split would work on either (future) side because they have the same origins. That is how blockchain ledgers work in a very basic way.

@_date: 2017-07-15 15:03:35
Any wallet that gives you access to your own private keys will be sufficient, although, hardware wallets like ledger or trezor are the most secure. 
If you have your private key and a chain where to split you will be able to access both sides of the chain with same private key. Might take a few days-weeks for wallets to adapt and you might have to backup your wallet in a different wallet but coins don't disappear if you have controle of the account. 
Remember wallets are really just "secure" keys to the public block chain where your coins are actually stored.

Yes. You can backup multiple wallets to the same account. Not all wallets are comparable, but the private keys are not proprietary to a specific wallet. So, yes.

If you did not write down your 12-24 word backup phrase shortly after setting up your ledger you are fucked. I recommend you send all your coins to a different wallet then either backup that wallet on your ledger or send the coins to your ledger after you set up a new wallet and recorded your private word seed. 
Suerte hermano ����������
Edit: note that bitcoin is stored on the public blockchain. Your "wallet" is more like an encrypted key that allows you access to your publicly stored coins. Hardware wallets like ledger are "secure" because they have a level of encryption that makes it necessary to have the devise in your hand to send the coins. That said, with the backup phrase your can access the same coins on a variety of wallets. If you loose your ledger your coins are still accessible if you have your word phrase/private keys.

All other coins have tiny networks compared to bitcoin's blockchain. Aside from making them more vulnerable to hacks it also makes them less globally useful. 
Transferring between banks in different countries takes a few days. 
If time is a variable we have to admit that the world (as humans interact with it) is getting smaller and national boarders are restricting true human progress. 
Edit: bitcoin is quickly becoming the first transnational currency and that is really exciting (at least for me) ����
Edit2: our current national public and private banking systems "work" (depending where you live that word is relative) because people trust that the state will give them "credit". Everything revolves around the state's gauge of who has more credit and who does not. The whole nation-state system seems somewhat antiquated, imo. Just like bitcoin, world's pop needs to scale ✊��������

No.��. Find a wallet that lets you control/have your private keys. Using coinbase as your wallet means you have to trust coinbase because they controle your private keys. If they are hacked you could loose everything. 
Do what most do, buy btc from coinbase and immediately transfer it to a different wallet.

While there are many ways to respond to your question, if we examine your example at a larger scale (i.e. National to Global) the comparison starts to break down. Just try to transfer money between two different national accounts and see how quick it is. 
As far as I am concerned, bitcoins greatest advantage is that it is a truly global/ decentralized store of value.

If you don't have much technical knowledge you should just buy it and store it on a wallet. A couple of hours on google and YouTube will be sufficient to educate you how to buy it and store it, what private Keyes are etc. 
Cheapest asic miners are over 1000 usd. And if you don't have cheap electricity they are not worth the investment if you only plan to get one. But if you are inclined there is lots of current info online, not to mention a specific subreddit dedicated to the subject. r/bitcoinmining
