It is a debatable topic with no clear answer at this time.  The IRS made a ruling that it should be treated like property, which makes sense in certain circumstances.  For example if you buy bitcoin with FIAT as an investment then sell it for FIAT, you probably should pay capital gains tax the same as those who trade and invest in currencies like the Euro.  But when using the Euro as a currency to buy goods and services there would be no tax obligation.  
The IRS has admitted however that bitcoin can sometimes act like property, but also that it can act like a currency.  From the IRS notice: "In some environments, virtual currency operates like “real” currency — i.e., the coin and paper money of the United States or of any other country that is designated as legal tender, circulates, and is customarily used and accepted as a medium of exchange in the country of issuance — but it does not have legal tender status in any jurisdiction." (
So they are admitting bitcoin acts like a real currency at times.  But they are saying since bitcoin is not yet legal tender in any country that they want to call it property instead of currency.  If bitcoin was adopted as legal tender in some tiny country then the argument for bitcoin as currency would be made even stronger.
Although the IRS claims that because bitcoin is not legal tender in any country that it is property and not currency, these claims are not backed by much, and may not hold up in court.  Also congress has not passed any laws that make this the case.  All we have is a statement from the IRS. Statements from the IRS are not absolute truths.  If one day some tiny country makes bitcoin legal tender, then according to the IRS statement there will be no tax obligation for buying goods with bitcoin.

Use mycelium as your hot wallet for spending or transferring funds.  Then put the rest in a savings wallet in cold storage on USB flash drive or a paper wallet.  Here is a good cold storage tutorial: 
Also you could buy a Trezor to keep your coins safe, but also have them more accessbile for spending:

It could be a problem with blockchain.info.  Since mytrezor gets its information from blockchain.info, if there is a blockchain.info bug, it will effect your mytrezor wallet.  Try looking on a different block explorer to see if they show your transaction.

Personally I think if you do liquidate them now, you will regret it soon enough as the price will rebound, but that will be really difficult to convince your family of at this point.  You should remember that bitcoin is still in the distribution stage.  There are 3600 new coins mined every day, and the yearly inflation rate is well over 10%, probably more like 15 or 20% when considering a lot of coins have been lost forever.  This is the time to accumulate coins.  The next halving will come soon enough.  Perhaps you may consider liquidating at least 10% of the coins, and then look to try to buy back cheaper if the price drops.  This will reduce your risk a little bit, and then when you see the price dropping every day it won't hurt as much because you can buy some cheaper.

It is probably a lot safer to keep coins in CoinBase than MtGox.  Coinbase is a lot more competent.  They are a US company with like $100 million VC funding, they claim on their blog they have insurance on all deposits there.  However this insurance probably doesn't cover it if someone hacked your password, or stole your phone for the 2FA.
However, that being said, I recommend that you really should not keep any coins there for any serious amount of time. It depends on your amount of coins, and your risk tolerance. It is never a good idea to trust ANYONE with your private keys.  Coinbase is a great service for buying and selling bitcoins, but I prefer to move my coins from their web wallet, into my own wallet as soon as I possibly can.  You want to have a wallet where you store the private keys yourself, preferably in cold storage.  Also coinbase is known to restrict users activity if they are using bitcoins for things like gambling, or other unapproved activities.  This is because they are regulated as a Money Services Business, and must comply with government regulations and rules.
If you want to learn about cold storage here is one great tutorial by security expert Kristov Atlas: 
Also if you want to print paper wallets you can use something like  on a ubuntu linux bootable USB operating system.  You create the keys while disconnected to the internet, and print them out.  Then you shut down the computer and all evidence from the paper wallets should be automatically wiped from the memory.  This is the advantage of using a bootable operating system for cold storage.  Its pretty simple to do it, you just need someone to show you or find a tutorial.
Another option that is a little easier, is to just buy a trezor hardware wallet.  It costs about $119 worth of bitcoin to get one right now, so you'll have to decide if that is worth it to you:   It is designed to make it nearly impossible for hackers to steal your coins, while allowing you full control over your own wallet and private keys.

The US monetary supply has tripled since 2008.  The debasement of the dollar is accelerating.  The banks are getting too-big-to fail banker bailouts that make them even bigger.  With regulatory capture, bailouts and bail-ins, it is only a matter of time before this house of cards collapses.  This will have people fed up and looking for alternatives.  I am not sure why you can't see the writing on the wall.

It was more likely a fellow cop who took a bad beat in the poker game, or had a grudge against the 2 players for whatever reason.  Then he used his government power and connections to make a phone call, and have it done.

Yes it could be a privacy concern, and it feels creepy. These transactions have been happening more than ever in the last couple of weeks.  Possibly it is an attempt to map addresses.  One possibility is the sender is sending these tiny transactions to your address hoping that it will be included as a future output in another transaction so it can link this address with the other addresses in that transaction.
If someone designed a wallet that allowed you to in a sense get rid of or block these transactions it may be good for privacy on the network.  I realize that the blockchain can't block transactions, but the wallet software can decide to just ignore such spam transactions and not include them in future outputs when making spends from the wallet.

Yeah run away and use bitcoin as much as possible instead.  When you are your own bank, you don't need permission to send funds.

Where is your proof of this?  You are wrong, regulations allow for "regulatory capture", which results in things like too-big-to-fail banker bailouts or bail-ins.  My proof is history.
Are you that upset that someone can sell some bitcoins if they want, and others can buy them at that price?  If someone puts a 30,000 buy wall are you against that also?  Welcome to freedom.  You are like a domesticated animal that can no longer survive in the wild of a free market, because you have been coddled by your nanny state government your entire life.

There are really two types of wallets, a web wallet where you trust a third party to hold your private keys, or a desktop/mobile wallet, which allows you to hold your own private keys.  You want the second kind so you don't have to trust anyone with your coins except yourself.  You will be your own bank, welcome to freedom :)

But the prosecutors whole case resides on the fact that the server is owned by Mr. Ulbricht, therefore it is pretty ridiculous to try to claim that the 4th amendment doesn't apply.  They are just playing a confidence game.  Every time they violate rights, they will just play a confidence game and use joke arguments to back it up, and the sheeple will just say ok.

The Bridges in my area are falling apart, the streets are filthy and full of potholes and unfinished government jobs.  The health care is attrocious thanks to the "affordable care act", which makes it even more unaffordable.  The police are corrupt and not held accountable for their own crimes, why should anyone get state pensions from our tax money?  All the things you mentioned could be done much better by a free market than the state.  You have just been so brainwashed by propaganda, you think the government hangs the sun in the morning, and makes the wind blow.

It is super easy to use really, perfect for beginners.  I think it is really secure and I feel safe storing a significant amount of bitcoins on it. The only issues I have had is a couple times, the MyTrezor.com web wallet had a few glitches and bugs (which had nothing to do with security of the coins).  But that is to be expected for a new platform, and they have quickly fixed every issue so far.
Also when Electrum 2.0 comes out possibly in November, they will have Trezor support in it.  So this means no need to rely on the MyTrezor webwallet anymore.  Also there may be new features implemented by the Trezor team in the future, like multi-sig wallets, or privacy tools etc..
I think Trezor is one of the coolest and most important recent developments in the bitcoin community.

Although he may have been anti-semetic to a large degree for a big portion of his life, I don't think that is why he said that about the monetary system.  I think he said it because he understood the scam of the banking system.  His knowledge of this scam probably contributed to his anti-semitism in an attempt in his mind to try to blame someone or a group of people for the problem. 
No man is perfect, but just because someone is imperfect or an anti-semite, doesn't mean their criticisms of the monetary system are wrong.  Also it is good to know that at least Ford was against the concentration camps by the Nazis, and he had his final most serious stroke at age 83 immediately after seeing video of the camps and being confronted with the attrocities that he had contributed to with his anti-semitic rhetoric. 
Ford was a pretty successful and smart guy after all, but his anti-semitic streak won't be judged well by history, which is a shame because people will use it to discredit anyone who is critical of the current scam banking system that tripled the monetary supply since 2008 and gives too-big-to-fail banker bailouts.

Here is the transaction address: 
The coins have already been moved to 6 new addresses, so it is likely some service like an exchange, tumbler, merchant, or betting site that you have used recently.  It looks like you have sent 1.17 bitcoins to the same address before on 9/12/2014, from this address 16XQPjnpN3j5Rw72e43sJnMuMw1TnaMGjQ, sound familiar? If so contact the owner of the website where the coins were sent.

They may be only able to load so much bitcoin onto these machines at a time.  So when the price goes down, it creates a strong buy demand because people want cheap coins, then they are sold out and the operator has to replenish their bitcoins before it can operate again.

The Declaration says those rights were endowed to us by the Creator, by God.  They are God given rights.  The government is set up by the people to secure these rights.  And when a government stops protecting these rights, the document says it is the peoples' right and duty to overthrow that government and replace it with a system that does secure their rights.

Funny how they blame libertatrians for losing them money.  And Krugman says this:
"So how’s it going? Bitcoin prices are down by two-thirds from their peak, and Izabella Kaminska, who has stayed with the subject, finds the sad story of a gullible rube who appears to have impoverished himself by believing in the hype."
I guess he is only worried about the short term bitcoin price, and not the fact that the price is up 3300% in the last 2 years.  Also no mention of how the dollar has lost over 97% of its value since the creation of the Federal Reserve in 1913 to oversee our monetary system, interesting.
@_date: 2014-10-05 00:19:50
Even funnier are the "I told you so" people who take huge pleasure in the price dropping, and feel the need to rub it in.  Paul Krugman in his recent hit piece on bitcoin says "hows that going for ya now?".  They are so pleased to have bitcoiners lose money.  Yet when the price goes up again, they will have their mouths shut.

Just because the IRS ruled something does not make it law.  Congress did not vote on this ruling.  If they want to take someone to court over not paying taxes when using bitcoin to purchase goods, they will have a very hard time proving their case. 
Bitcoin can be used as property for capital gains investment, but it can also be used as a currency and to say otherwise is ludicrous.  There is no capital gains tax when spending Euros on goods. Just because the IRS says something, doesn't make it fact or law.  I suppose if they declared that Bitcoin was actually made of unicorns and leprechauns we would have to take that as fact also.
The IRS is a criminal organization that targets innocent people to audit them for their political views or if they criticize the President.  Then people like Lois Lerner lie to congress and she has her e-mails and hard drives destroyed to cover the IRS crimes.

Just do it, don't use vouchers, just give them the option to receieve bitcoin in their wallet.  If they want to use bitcoin when signing up, have them provide their public key address. Calculate the CAD market value at the moment of transmission. I wouldn't worry about taxes, the fluctuations will be so small anyways, are they really going to punish you for it? If you are really concerned you could use a service to buy bitcoins and transmit them immediately to the recipient so that you don't have to worry about any capital gains or loss by the University for tax purposes.  The tax burden would then be entirely on the recipient of the bitcoins when they sell or purchase goods with it:

The constitution and Declaration of Independence are two different documents, both very important though.

Because the 5th amendment gives you the right to remain silent and not incriminate yourself.  The prosecutors are alleging that the servers ARE his, and now they are saying unless you incriminate yourself, we have the right to violate the 4th amendment here as well.  Its very wrong and criminal, and hopefully these judges and prosecutors will be brought to justice for their crimes of violating the constitution and civil rights of Mr. Ulbricht and fenagling the legal system.
