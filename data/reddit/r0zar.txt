The one time I heard Rhett speak on Richard Heart's podcast I knew immediately he was clueless with a specific talent for suckering uninformed people out of their money.

Does Google trends show results based on unique ips? I for one Google "bitcoin news" like a madman when I see signals like this week.

Running a full node is like being a citizen in a country. You get to vote. Except it's a perfect country where your vote matters.

That would be a maximalist definition of it imo. I think as long as you advocate/fight for data, communication and financial privacy it would fit. I think there can be a compromise between the two.

Correction, you don't need to make a second transaction to replenish your "balance". You can have off\-chain \(LN\) BTC moved onto your channel from elsewhere on the network.
Also not sure what you mean about this people being born to fast. A lot of the younger generation is beginning to have fewer children.
