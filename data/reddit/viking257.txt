You mean send the coin from Gdax to a storage wallet?

Me: Don’t invest more than you can afford to loose.
Inner Dark Me: Go all fucking in

Just hodl on cowboy. You will fold alongside the other weak hands in the pinch so standby

Too much horn in these bulls. This bitcoin cash campaign is lame too.  The big money backs the real thing not wannabes!

Belly up? You do know they are owned by hashcoins. Who made the best miners around for the longest. They have never let me down since 2014....

Copy your wallet address you want to send the coin to then click on withdraw inside the Gdax platform, btc wallet, enter copied destination address, then amount to withdraw. Send.

It will eventually make its way back to you if its not confirmed. I use to go on coinbin and double spend it with a higher fee but im not sure if you can still do that or not 
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:26:11
Ive been doing that for some time now and it amazes me how many people still just don’t know that and get eaten alive by fees. Good stuff bringing that up John!
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:01:54
Thanks! I ended up doing a double spend with a higher fee and it went right through!

I was watching that on SA this morning. He sounded like an idiot. “Yea its I dunno Im not saying buy some because who knows you know. Buy Nvidia because Nvidia is AI and Nvidia is Bitcoin...smh hilarious 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:37:24
Im not sure how to do that
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:55:52
Lol how?

Dude yes, I got this. Everyone gets concerned when somebody comes by and just wants to shill a little fomo.  Have we grown that sensitive as redditers. We really need that religious moderator back on this sub. He always gave helpful tips too in times of market stress. He would say things like, “buy and pray”, “Holy shit we are fucked”, and FOMO(FaithOvercomesManyObsticles)
So much knowledge that guy.

Agreed. The person that took the photo had no intention to try to take this photo in secrecy.
