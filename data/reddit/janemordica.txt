3 minutes after coinfire.cf went down the following giggling on paycoin's forum was posted. When it only was a text/plain page with just the coinfire name on it and long before a whois was even thought to be done, and long before coinfire revealed their cloudflare issue publicly:
oh they went down due to DDOS....oh.....such a shame.....pissed off the wrong bunch of people I guess. tear. As I said a few days ago "they will get there's..no worry about that...at all".
Perhaps someone got into their registrar and changed some things....hmmm...tooo bad...guess we will never know
Also they are setting up cloudflare to try to avoid this, ha. This is why it appears down at the moment.
