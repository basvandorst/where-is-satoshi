Right! I'm well aware of the risks with exchanges!
What's stopping me from replicating a fake app for Chase or Wells Fargo and hoping people throw some passwords in. The banks would be down Apples throat! How apple can let a very obvious copy go through is awful mismanagement. I'd expect something like this on Google play app. I believed everything was vetted on Apple? Clearly not. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 10:17:07
Never again. And will likely spread the word. The average end user needs to be careful but this is ridiculous.

For the average computer user that seriously sounds harder than trying to buy illegal diamonds as an investment. I've used breadwallet for 2 years and have been happy moving 10s of thousands on and off an exchange. I know there are less scrupulous apps around and even though he was on the other side of the world I made sure the breadwallet icon came up on the video chat. I didn't know Apple would allow such an obvious exact copy to be vetted and so it didn't even cross my mind that would be an issue.
Do you break down and analyze every pain medication you take when you buy it from a legitimate pharmacist? No.
I assumed the same trust with Apple and they gave me a poison pill.

It's fucking back up?!? I'm beginning to think someone in Apple is approving these knowingly. Whether it's someone low on the totem who has a mate put these in and they approve it hoping to split the takings or its a bigger picture to push Apple Pay I don't know but fuck Apple and their false walled garden. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:33:54
I told him breadwallet. How closely were they replicated? Fingerprint ID, recovery phase. All the same?
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:35:03
What were some differences? He did get a notification from Apple today asking to check for unauthorized apps. He downloaded it on Wednesday. Was the scam one still there then? He is in the US I am in Aus so I can't see their App Store.
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:57:09
Fucking livid. Understandably.
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:48:35
Is this a viable option? This really compromises their 'Apple garden of Eden' mantra. We've lost $11,000USD. What's to stop fake Wells Fargo or Chase apps??
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:22:28
Yea I understand some apps can be compromised, but what you're saying is essentially never use your phone for money, banking, stock trading etc. for fear of your device being compromised.
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:48:50
Will do. This is blatant fraud and theft!
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:47:23
I'm in Aus App Store he is US. I didn't even know a fake existed. We did it on video chat and I saw the breadwallet icon and went 'yep that one'. This is really apples fault for allowing this bullshit. 
@_date: 2016-08-07 04:29:01
On closer inspection of his iTunes purchases it doesn't have the LLC but it's identical in every other way. So fucked up Apple lets that shit through! 
@_date: 2018-01-17 10:10:54
A friend of mine was that guy, I told him it was a ponzi, he knew, so I was like ok ��‍♂️ it went south while he was sleeping.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:18:06
Crazy how something so new is already deemed a ‘store of value’. Even google is double bitcoins age and no ones running around saying google shares are a ‘store of value’.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:38:03
My understanding it can handle 8 times the transactions before fees start to go over 1 cent. A which point they just bump up the blocks again.
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:20:28
Im sure 90% of merchants would and do convert their crypto instantly, but they’re at least accepting it. It was a start. This is a big step backwards for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:36:15
Going to have to do a lot more than Segwit to stay ahead. Right now bitcoin is in a running race in a wheelchair. And segwit will give it wheels...
@_date: 2018-01-08 04:09:14
Right, I’ve given up trying to show people how it works, it’s disappointing. If thy really want to see how the network works I flick a couple bucks of Bcash. Is this lightening network thing going to be as seamless as bch is now? Otherwise bitcoins in trouble :/
@_date: 2018-01-08 05:32:40
Right now it’s a ‘store of value’ no different to a Van Gogh or a classic car, or a bar of gold. And just as expensive to move around ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:25:30
Except in this case it was indeed poor timing...
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:50:02
Bitcoin is more like a 1968 MG, great in its day, still fun to know it’s price, but costs me a bomb and breaks down every time I want to take it out for a spin. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:14:47
Not a limited supply, eventually got cheaper. Terrible comparison.
@_date: 2015-12-27 01:46:06
I was doing a lap of US on a motorbike then. Holy crap was that a great holiday ;)
@_date: 2016-01-26 12:23:22
Yea I took a holiday in China last year and thought it wasn't that bad over there. But alas, I'm from Australia :(
@_date: 2016-01-15 04:25:35
I wonder if this combined with the Mike Hearn news is causing the price slip.
@_date: 2016-01-22 05:06:08
We're already there! 
In dollarydoos :/
@_date: 2016-06-12 00:40:34
The past few weekends have seen jumps, then a fall on Mon/tue. Might have something to do with people unable to get cash onto exchanges? I dunno.
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:06:02
Yeah, I wouldn't suggest 10s of thousands. But she has more chance of screwing up a transfer or losing keys than coinbase does of going under. Life is all about weighing up risk ain't it!
@_date: 2016-06-13 08:55:39
3am flight tomorrow ��
@_date: 2017-01-02 05:55:57
I have a friend who uses hers like that. She understands bitcoin, but in reality is likely to lose recovery codes/ her phone etc. weighing up options, leaving it on coinbase with 2fa is the best option against loss.
@_date: 2016-06-23 05:30:48
Also there's r/breadwallet 
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:14:57
Yah. I recently switched to authy. Multi device is awesome.
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:16:14
To add another device you need to be in control of one of them already. And even then authy shows what devices are authorized.
@_date: 2017-04-25 15:18:05
Doesn't really matter what currency ;) it's just worth one oz of gold.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:14:25
Fuck yes. That double order cost me $500 ��
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:14:25
Fuck yes. That double order cost me $500 ��
@_date: 2017-09-02 00:13:44
Quite the opposite, lightening network requires a 3rd party to manage the offchain transactions.
@_date: 2018-02-18 08:27:48
@_date: 2016-10-23 00:35:13
But weirdly you get that higher rate when selling too. Great way to cash out!
@_date: 2016-05-08 08:17:12
Yea, and because so many people were renouncing their citizenship because they were sick of paying taxes to the US for working in say, France. The US gov panicked and jacked the fees 400% to take one last stab at your hard earned.
@_date: 2016-05-02 05:17:23
Right so it's like Greece. It'll spiral out of control until the lenders accept a smaller cut, which are apparently hedge funds who tend to want 100% or no deal. Yeah they're in trouble.
@_date: 2016-05-08 07:47:58
Right, but any US citizen who earns money 
-anywhere- else in the world must pay tax to the US government. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 02:24:40
That's 700%ish a year. Not even ruthless payday lenders charge that 
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:03:33
Optimistic, in a speculative investment you can be a bull (charge ahead with confidence), or a bear (hide away and hibernate)
@_date: 2017-07-30 17:15:26
When it split etc and eth combined value was equal to it original price, however to people following one (either chain) it appeared as a loss, which caused panic, lack of confidence and further sell offs, once the dust settled the new eth took off. I think the winner here is whoever has the most exchanges ad wallets behind them. I don't fully understand the 'technicalities' behind BCC but I believe it's trying to allow smaller transaction costs. If it becomes the same as bitcoin but allows people to say buy coffee easier id say it's a winner, the trade off to allow this is where I'm not fully sure.
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:14:35
I would hazard a bet it's going to replicate what eth did after it's fork... having said that I'll hold both after the split to see what happens.
@_date: 2016-05-02 03:27:34
Didn't he say they were unable to default due to some law?
@_date: 2016-05-08 15:20:48
Yea you are totally correct. But the US sticking their finger up your ass to check for loose change is still a fucking joke. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 07:11:32
Except in the eth case the new chain took off...
@_date: 2016-07-03 13:17:53
Or in a car accident, or fall off your chair wrong, or have a stroke.
