You have a production mainnet on LiteCoin now capable of Lightning transactions yet you refuse to back up your claim with a demonstration.  Your claims are false.  
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:55:23
A claim doesn't work like that.  You would have to prove santa claus DOES exist.  It seems you know nothing of bitcoin or argument.   Now...backup your claim or stfu.  
@_date: 2017-05-13 19:33:47
It's the claimants job to back up their claim.  Let's see your proof.
@_date: 2017-05-14 01:03:46
Even if Lightning works, the transactions still have to be committed on-chain.  You've simply added an extra step and more wait time.  
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:40:31
It's still going to be expensive to go on-chain and if you don't your money isn't your money but stuck in this payment channel.
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:51:40
You can tell it's decentralized because they took away the commit access of the original devs.
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:22:46
Unrelated to your claims.  You have LiteCoin now to show proof.  Do it.  Show the benefits.   Show people opening channels with thousands of different people sending transactions over that channel, then show them all getting their bitcoins out safely if someone decides not to pay.   Let's see the proof.  
@_date: 2017-05-13 21:30:51
Especially with the 4x capacity they have on-chain.
@_date: 2017-05-13 19:42:26
Once your coins are in the channel, you have to pay to get them out.  That's the bottom line.  If others don't pay to close the channel, you're screwed.  LN "transactions" are NOT full bitcoin transactions until they are committed on chain and while your coins are in the channel, they are unusable to you.  Good luck getting them back if others decide not to pay.   
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:30:47
So...it's broken before it's even working. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:10:34
Someone obviously knows they've lost an argument.  
Edit:  I could care less about Bu.  Core should raise their block size to 4MB.
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:11:21
LiteCoin capacity is due to the 2.5 minute block time which is 4x the capacity of Bitcoin.  They already could scale 4x more.
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:01:10


Literally makes no sense.  That's all about throughput.  Now I'm not advocating 8MB blocks YET but it's quite literally a function of throughput.  Stop with the scare tactics.  Blocksize could be 1TB and it would still just be a function of throughput.  
Right now we need a 4MB block size.
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:06:09
Yes...they aren't related to getting your coins out.  Not sure what's hard to follow about that.   Let's see I'm going to call a function booger-butt-locks.   You can literally name a function anything.  It doesn't do what he's suggesting it does.
@_date: 2017-05-13 20:16:27
This simply isn't true.  You can't frontend closing a channel like that with a ton of people making transactions while it's open.   Provide proof to your claims or quit making them.
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:21:31
That only happens when the block size isn't artificially restrained and a price hike is allowed to happen via a transaction throughput increase.  It didn't moon last time because of Core's absurd antics.  We'd likely be well over 5000 now.  
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:20:52
You have a production mainnet on LiteCoin now capable of Lightning transactions.  It's the claimant's burden to defend his claim.  Defend it.  Show proof.  There is nothing stopping you from doing that unless you're lying.
You're not a liar are you?
@_date: 2017-05-13 15:14:48
You're stuck on chain until everyone pays their transaction fees.  Money locked away from you...useless.
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:01:20
Now back up your claim.   It does NOT work the way you claim.  Hell, if it did, by the time the channel was closed, the average block fee could have been raised and the transaction wouldn't even be committed on chain.  Think McFly.  Think.
Edit:  Especially considering transactions are being held hostage now by a 1MB block size restriction.  
Edit2:  If you can't backup your claim now showing what you have just described on the production LiteCoin network then what is the point?  Stop lying and SHOW THE PROOF.  You have a production mainnet now.  Use it.  If you don't, you're just blowing smoke and lying.
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:59:38
Defend your claim.  Don't just lie.
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:58:15
I have't read anything about timeouts. You're lying.  Still you'd have to pay to go back on-chain even if they do implement that in the future and it would be even more since now you can't split the fees among many people.  So, this fails as a scaling mechanism.  This won't even work for small payments.
@_date: 2017-05-13 21:24:03
...and yet he is lying.  No one apparently wants to backup any claims they make here.
@_date: 2017-05-13 19:59:08
...and unrelated.
@_date: 2017-05-13 18:46:14
At the time, all Core had to do was raise the block size and this would all have been over.  You know how LiteCoin has 4x the capacity of bitcoin now....not hard.   No way they would have had Lightning working in time to scale back then.  Hell they don't even have it functioning except in a  bare bones way with LiteCoin now.  
Own it buddy...you can't campaign your way out of that.  
@_date: 2017-05-13 04:35:39
You mean reddit.
@_date: 2017-05-13 19:33:01
Yeah that's total bs.  Almost anyone can run a full node and if you can't run one from your dial-up connection...oh well.  Wait.   Most people can and soon you will be able to with much larger blocks.  
Heck, get a 5 dollar box from digital ocean and run a pruning node. The unbanked of the world shouldn't wait on your swamp connection to be able to buy bread.    How selfish are you?
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:59:15
Defend your claim.  Don't just lie.  
@_date: 2017-05-13 15:17:04
They aren't yours until the payment has been made to go back on-chain and if your transactions are mixed in with a ton others, they aren't free until everyone has paid.   Sorry you thought you knew something and had cool tech when you didn't.
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:25:42
All bitcoin now locked in payment channel and not on-chain so you can't really spend it anywhere else.  In some ways this is worse than having them on an online wallet.  They literally can't be spent outside of whatever this payment channel has access to.  So, they aren't really your bitcoins and are locked there.  No idea why people are cheering that.
