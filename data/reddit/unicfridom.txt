As a relatively newbie, this is what I don't get. All this talk about how great bitcoin is, yet yoy have to pay for a simple transaction, and even worse, the more you pay, the better you're "treated".
Am I missing something?

Well, giving the rich more power is a great way for rich people to make decisions that will that'll make them even richer, even potentially at the cost of the rest. Kind of like society is today.
I don't have a particular situation in mind, but I'm sure they would think of something if there were enough money involved.

And if the Sweden, Germany or France were in China's situation, would you have made this post in the same exact manner? I think not.

Good call, but moderators have the ability to ban a post and then øater approving it, so we have no way of knowing if it was banned or not.

I bought my first coin at 1062. I couldn't care less that it's going down. I'd rather risk buying a bit high than waiting, hoping it'll get lower, and then potentially missing the chance to get in. For all I know it could have been at 1500 now, and then I would really fucking regret not buying at 1062.

So then I guess you're not allowed to use roads, get protection from the police, and etc.

Society as a whole (and obviously poor children, elders and etc.).

How do we know it didn't get banned? You can still link to banned posts, but you won't find them in the "new" section or anywhere else.
