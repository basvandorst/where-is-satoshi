Read the article. Author doesn't understand bitcoin.
Claims it is too volatile to be used for savings and the financial privacy is its main benefit.

Wow. Going to think long and hard about this one.

You say 'he' as if we know for fact that they are one person or even a male.

The industrial uses are especially interesting. We will have autonomous machines that will send bitcoin globally for authentication and verification purposes.
Also, plenty more machines that are self-twittering.

This is such great news!
Anyone here run bitcoin podcasts? Please send me some as I'm looking to add them to my phone.

The NYSE jumping on Coinbase is indeed a big deal. One must be cautious though that Coinbase is not collecting private information on all its customers though.

I believe he said 'Bitcoin' will end the nation state. Bitcoin to me encompasses bitcoin as a currency AND as a decentralized consensus blockchain.
@_date: 2015-01-19 19:25:52
This guy actually gets it.
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:47:46
I believe he said **'bitcoin will end the nation state'**. What kind of technology do you think these decentralized frameworks for information, justice, commodities, etc. will be built upon? 
Could it be argued it will be built upon bitcoin technology?
@_date: 2015-01-21 18:27:16
Wow, great idea. Can't wait to see what kind of transcript comes out of this.

If I start mining with an ASIC, can I use this hard drive to store the full blockchain or will I have to copy it to another storage device?

Likewise, this is certainly an interesting development in the crypto space.

Thanks for the contribution. I think this is accurate and people will be using bitcoin really without even knowing it.

What are the best insights from your book/research volume?

5% load fee? That means if you load $5000 onto the card you are paying $250 in fees. That is worse than the banks current offerings.

Yes. It is a sentence.

also states at the end of the article that embedded mining could be the first step in an "always online" reality. With that comes the ability for those in power to disconnect you with the "flip of a switch".

Memorizing the 12-word mnemonic is fine. However, you are using a intermediary (the wallet client) to memorize your private key, not your own brain. Therefore, memorizing the mnemonic is not a brainwallet because you are not memorizing your private key.

I've used Tails sparingly. It is very unique as you said 'you start from nothing every time'.
Now that it comes preloaded with a bitcoin wallet client, Tails may get a big boost from bitcoin users.

Pretty impressed with Google, except for the fact that there is no plural form of bitcoin. (bitcoins)

That would be an interesting one to add. What rich is exactly though is very subjective, especially for a global money system.

Easiest way I've seen thus far is through social media commenting (Reddit and Google+).
I'm quite certain there are bitcoin tipping options through email right now, but none that I am completely familiar with.
Maybe someone on here can shed some light on this?

Brilliant. New paradigms don't exist by the current generation adopting them necessarily, but the old dying off and a new generation taking its place.
