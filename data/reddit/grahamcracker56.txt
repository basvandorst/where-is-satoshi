Why would you even bother selling right now after it’s returned to its previous lows (referring to last year). “Most” folks would love the opportunity to have that much BTC in their possession. Might as well hold on to it and see where it takes you in the next 3-5 years. Fiat currency has historically only lasted about 40 years before something is altered to it (e.g. Nixon taking the dollar to the global platform &amp; off the gold standard). Chances are that prices will be impacted when the current fiat model fails - might as well have 52 BTC to dispose of when everyone wants a non-fiat alternative. 
Just my 2 cents - do whatever feels right to you.

More like another option to store my value. It’s not my currency of choice but it’s another option.  Whatever is most widely accepted by a population will be the currency of choice. Unless I  can get an edge by using another option

Hey guys,
I’ll be using my CPA this year. What’s the best approach to informing him about my crypto investments &amp; showing him how I came up with the math for my payments? 
This is the second time using him but the first time with these types of investments. Any help would be awesome! If you have additional questions for me please ask!

I’m using it to store value, y’all haters can spend all you want.

I still can’t believe it’s rising so quickly

Can you do one with an alien? 
Yes - I realize this is a completely off the wall idea, but I just think it’d be so funny to have a crypto alien piece chillin in my apartment.
If not, it’s all good. I’ll keep waiting for someone to do it.
Nice piece by the way! Excellent work.

Why is this even being brought up?
 The IRS hasn’t even had an opportunity to review all the tax information from the population.

I work at Amazon &amp; I would still urge anyone getting into this space to order from the manufacturer for any type of crypto security product. Just my 2 cents
