Sure, which is why when Bitcoin came out it was worth almost nothing. And the market should price low strike cost of old coins into account, but you're describing the situation years ago. Any bitcoin created in the past few years absolutely had significant investment costs. This is part of why bitcoins are more expensive than other virtual tokens.
Just as it costs "nothing" to make a virtual token, that token is also worth no more than the network that manages it. It certainty does not cost "nothing" to build a massive distributed trust-less system with 3rd party attack resistance at cost-prohibitive levels for even moderately large transactions. The value isn't in the token, it's in the system that says most assuredly the token is yours, and you can give it to someone else like cash, but digitally. Any real long term value has to be considered in the context of the economy its infrastructure would support rather than the item itself. 
So long as you treat Bitcoin like a commodity instead of a currency, its value really doesn't make sense, I agree. 


And such bets done consistently over time with a plan is generally called investing IMO. 
Edit: can't grammar today

So would you not consider a leveraged ETF an investment vehicle, or any sort of leveraged action on another market for that matter? 


This is what I mean. You are investing in a currency, betting it's value will fluctuate up  or down relative to other currencies. Eg, if I put a $1k long position into Yen, then I absolutely just invested $1k in Yen.

It actually costs thousands in electricity and mining hardware in bitcoin's case, which is where both the security and value come from. 


This is literally what forex trading is
