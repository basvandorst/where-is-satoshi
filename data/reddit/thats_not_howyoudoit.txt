Please stop quoting their calculator.
Hardware can make X amount as a snapshot in time - literally - at this moment.
Over time, that amount will decrease, sometimes significantly, as network difficulty increases.
Fry your GPU mining? How much will that set you back? 
I'm not even saying don't do it, but please understand that you're quoting a sales pitch.
Based on what you've been saying here it likely doesn't include a variable to account for decreased profitability over time. $38 this month, $35 next month, $29 after that, boom, GPU goes (-$500 or whatever a 1070 goes for these days)... start again... etc. etc.
Oops - you were away for a day and something happened (power blip, software glitch), that's a day of shares missing. 
Want to do it for fun? Go for it. $38/month in bitcoin could be worth a huge amount next year - it could also be worthless. Can you just invest $38/month? Again, you should read up as much as you can about the pros AND cons and make a decision. Don't take anything for granted and certainly don't take claims from a car dealer that they're cars will get "x" fuel economy. ;)
Good luck and good mining!

perhaps. The two are unrelated unfortunately. Crypto currencies are generally backed by philosophies (which are in some cases business plans). People invest in a given philosophy (invest time, talent, capital, services and products). Seriously. 
You might be able to use your dad’s gold or funds from gold sale to hire a team, but you’d need a business case (ex. a precious metals or gems Blockchain). 
Otherwise sell your gold for BTC and invest in this one. 
You should understand that you came to a specific currency’s forum Where many users believe in the ideals and philosophy of that currency and asked how to make your own “something” with no idea as to what that could be. Thus you were met with pushback. Alt coins are not something that are actively discussed on this sub unless they relate directly to bitcoin and by bitcoin I mean BTC (XBT).

Lightning isn't really "Live" on the bitcoin network so I don't believe the team will produce anything to help with mainnet node discovery or exploration until the network is truly ready-to-go. 
There remain a few bugs to work out with each implementation and no one wants to be loosing their bits. I've seen a few tBTC go missing - nothing major but it would hurt a bit with the real thing.
I'd say it's pretty close - but give it time - better to do it right than rush it out half finished. 
Also, much like segwit - it's going to need to be implemented by those who want to use it. Sure we'll be able to send to each other, but exchanges and more will need to incorporate it like any other network service / improvement. 
While I wish it would be transformative over night, the uptake will likely take some time from the bigger players - again, if at all since there's no requirement to use it. On the flip side if everyone is using it, well then it would be silly not to - but reasoned decisions haven't come easy for bitcoin of late.
I will say this - having used it a fair amount now, it's fantastic.

You don't leave all your money attached to debit card. Some of it is in accounts accessible to you but not via that card directly (even if that card can be used at your bank to authenticate access to it). Similarly you will not and should not lock up your "savings" in a LN channel. 
Yes, your 0.5BTC is tied up, but your main vault of 20BTC isn't. Adjust this ratio as needed. Open another channel if needed while you wait for the first to close. 
But yeah, the mempool likely won't be backlogged once LN is in use (at least in use in a way that everyone has immediate access to fund off-chain) because that's a ways away. Furthermore, LN, by necessity, uses Segwit. That means we effectively double on-chain TPS, while also moving a huge number of TXs off-chain - it's not a binary argument - bimodal perhaps. :P

The attack isn't the discussion - though you're right - we should be ready to discuss BTC's many shortcomings - it's the multi-pronged events (negative threads, misleading articles backed by questionable sources, spam tx'es on the network) which are currently stress-testing not just the network, but the consensus-centric ideology that is bitcoin.

Bitcoin Core fully supports SegWit wallets. Bitcoin QT (the GUI doesn't). I created a witness address today for my full node.
If you have a current(ish) address you can simply `addwitnessaddress addr` in the CLI/console where `addr` is a current receiving address.
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:56:25
You can. You’ll need to be sure you have your private keys and I’d recommend being exceptionally carefully. There was a lot of BTG shenanigans. 
If it was me, I’d sweep my BTC into a new segwit capable address then use my old wallet / private key in a virtual machine using the BTG core clone. Yeah, that means downloading the Blockchain but still - with the value of a “couple BTC” it’s worth the time and effort to not get them took. ;)

I'm not sure if you're trolling or not - it's hard to tell, so please excuse me otherwise.
1. How is it useful? This is a great question. I'd say there are a number of reasons:
 - If you use it as intended you have a copy of the blockchain and a wallet where you have direct control and access to your value store.
 - You can send value to anyone participating in the system without permission. 
 - You set the fees for service based on your needs.
2. $20 fees.
 - I'm not sure where this comes from. Sure some businesses are charging high fees due to poor design or greed, but these don't reflect the fees of the system. It's like blaming a government for the fees to withdraw cash when you're standing at a no-name ATM that adds an extra $4 service charge to your $20 withdrawal. 
 - Fees have skyrocketed when the network is being stress tested and/or something is afoot. 
 - Even if fees are $20 (and again, this is mostly fud), I paid over $50 to send 3000$ to England for a piece of equipment via wire transfer. 
 -  For more, please see point 4.
3. Hour long waits.
 - There have been issues and attacks; but an hour long wait to safely and securely send value isn't always a bug and becomes even more important when you absolutely need to know that value was transferred. 
 - As a business owner, when people pay us with their credit card, or even a cheque, that money is held for far longer and sometimes, even once made available it can be removed without our permission. See point 1. 
 - Also, please see point 4.
4. Buying coffee with it.
 - Why is this a thing at the moment? I'm serious. I've bought a plane ticket with it and if I wanted to try, I'm sure I could buy a (likely poor) coffee with it. However I find this stance or line of reasoning akin to us, as a society, being in the middle of construction on one of the modern wonders of the world and people are yelling at the slow, careful team of architects, engineers, and construction workers to hurry up so they can stand on top of it and take a selfie. If "it's coming" isn't a good answer, it's likely that BTC and the philosophy and science behind it aren't for you (yet.)

One thought, is that bitcoin's performance reflects a worry (not necessarily a panic) that exists regarding localized, currency with a centrally-vested authority. 
Overall his reasoning is worth listening to as a basis for discussion.
Unlike gold; which is his central comparison - bitcoin itself can evolve. The consensus design is both frustrating and incredibly powerful. 
Consensus means infinite possibilities; many of his points which might be concerns today, can be alleviated with future changes. Efficiency improvements (either in mining hardware, PoW, or something entirely different, even entirely new) would make the whole "mining crypto is the worst pollution we've ever seen" rhetoric unimportant - and efficiency has always been part of the mining equation. Is it important today? We shouldn't be willing to disregard anything because it's uncomfortable to think about and/or discuss.

I've been seeing that a lot lately. Memes about "first mover" etc.
It's important to note that in a software system where any property can be changed - first mover is essentially a straw man argument. 
Bitcoin's strength lies in the huge ecosystem and userbase around a consensus-based ruleset. IE, if we can agree, we can make bitcoin out to be anything we want as quickly or as slowly as is required to come to an agreement.
That's the whole point of it being decentralized; that's why it will (irrespective of price-per-coin) survive. 
Agreement is hard and, when things seem difficult (like our current stress test), it's easy to try to throw this requirement away for expediency. It's also when it matters most.

Adoption isn't necessarily going down.

From another thread today, but pertinent:
As someone who mined BTC when GPU mining was a thing, I recently I ran a test to see just how things could work out - for shits and giggles - but some simple reading would have resulted in the same conclusion. Here's the situation:
- Deposited ~0.05BTC ($120 USD a the time - but I was just playing around) for a 1TH/s lifetime contract.
- Within 15 days lifetime contracts became "annual contracts" - this alone should scare anyone away since nothing precludes many online "mining" companies from changing the terms further when it suits them.
- In 4 months my account was credited with ~0.0325 bitcoins. However, due to increased difficulty and value it looks like I will never make up the bitcoin I injected. While one could claim I was credited with more, between daily service fees, and withdrawal fees.... well they find an additional way to eat a large amount of "profit".
- They have continually raised the minimum amount for withdrawal - low-hashrate contracts may make withdrawals impossible for users in the future.
- They did not credit any forked coins - though they were obviously mined.
Now, if you could trust them to keep their end of the contract (read their TOS) AND you had deposited $120-$150USD in fiat/USD - you could likely make a profit.
*However*, at any point simply buying the corresponding amount of bitcoin is likely to be MORE profitable and, ultimately you'd have control over your assets.
If I had bought $120USD more of BTC at the time, I'd have my 0.05 I sent them, another 0.05BTC and I'd be up about ~~$1200USD~~ $1650USD today.
So TLDR: don't do it.
Edit: Apparently I don't know how much BTC is worth anymore just like that ridiculous joke.

You can use the legend to filter out the “chaff” at the bottom to see which range is confirming consistently and then make an informed guess. Basically you want to remove any ranges where little or no confirmations (inclusions in blocks) are occurring. Each peak represents a valid block transmitted across the network. The valley that follows the peak represents all the remaining unconfirmed transactions. 
So once you filter appropriately you get a glimpse of what’s going to likely be confirmed. 
It’s not a science though because floods of transactions in a specific range do occur, especially as people get wise to overpayment. 
Still the chart is also fun to play with. I guess I’m easily entertained.

My node with 60-90 connections runs at about that (1TB/month)

Trading fees and the assumption you already paid a fee bringing it in via Coinbase I imagine.

GDAX pays the fees so when you send 0.125 BTC out, that’s what you get at the other end. Nothing to add or subtract. 
They eat the TX fee, as simple as that. 
They’re not the only ones either.  QuadrigaCX does the same on outbound BTC. 
In GDAX  Simply go into a trading pair (ETH/BTC or LTC/BTC) and then fund that pair with BTC from your Coinbase wallet. 
You can then immediately send the BTC (without trading) anywhere sans fee!

I check it more than the bitcoin price. ;) and it hasn’t failed me yet for transaction pricing
I bought my wife a plane ticket with BTC and used it to price the fees. Got a warning from the vendor that my fees “weren’t high enough” but sure enough it confirmed pretty quickly.

People, if only few, have been known to change their minds. 
Life isn't quite as binary as we'd believe.
