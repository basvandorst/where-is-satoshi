Not for being an ass, for violating reddit's ToS. If you couldn't make an ass out of yourself on reddit there wouldn't even be a reddit.

If someone were to assume that after watching a few videos of idiots shooting guns at iPhones "speaks for 100% of the community" you're just as retarded as the people you accuse of being retarded. And retarded is such a lame word choice. You must be 12.

The entire idea behind the cell phone market is wasteful as a default. Nothing is ever even considered for recycling. We're ecologically screwed regardless.

Well, I hope my money helps them either way.

The idea behind the cell phone market today, to be way more specific than I was, is that it's on this 6 month to 1 year cycle and not even attempting to **recycle** old phones beyond giving them to another person to use as a shit phone.
If you go kill things that are of limited supply you actually kill off the possibility of something growing again.
What logic?

The founder of bitcoin found someone awkward enough to be believed to be the founder of bitcoin and made him look like the founder of bitcoin swearing him to secrecy giving him half the private key for 200 million dollars worth of bitcoin giving him the other half of the private key on his deathbed such that he can pass on the bitcoins to his children so long as he promises to take the secret of who *really* created bitcoin to his grave.

Has anyone ever paid attention in economics class?
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:09:46
Isn't it about how much economic activity it will be able to support? Cause the smaller sized transactions coming in one at a time are fucking everything up?
@_date: 2017-07-22 18:00:04
The volume of transactions per second was too high might be a better way to phrase that. From what I read I assumed the big issue is that the pipe is too small for the amount of liquid being put through, to borrow a phrase. When the block chain is hit with all these tiny payments exactly as they come in processing is a nightmare, even worse when they try and do a batch, because the block chain size doesn't support say, a store that wants to verify transactions all day and wait until after business is closed to send out the batch of everything. So they end up clogging up the block chain either way.
I'm not like, super into bitcoin, I watched a video recently and thought this was a problem people were trying to fix.

I remember reading an article about how a third of the miners are linked to a specific type of system. The article was basically trying to say, STAP, diversify before we lose what made this currency so good to use. I think in the final version there should ways for people who horde to be discouraged. Not sure how though. Not like it's hard to have multiple wallets or something.

The lack of constant advertising on the television is plummeting the price of gold. That's the only reason it got up so high in the first place. Same hype different commodity.

For starters you can write your own kernel. I wouldn't even make such a claim though, just an observation.

Actually I tried upgrading and didn't like 4.0+, I'm still running 2.3.6 and I've yet to run into too many programs I can't use. Plus, the battery life is something 4.0+ can't beat. I'm going to be really sad when I upgrade to a 4.0+ device.
@_date: 2013-04-02 13:12:51
I'm sure there are experts on here that could give a great overview of the process. However I get the impression that with something like bitcoin if you don't know how it works enough to buy a bitcoin you might be at a higher disadvantage when it comes to the way people lose bit coins. Be careful is what I'm saying.

That control should be given back to the people (or market forces). The idea that you'd have a single entity controlling this means it's inherently corrupt. I'll never forgive Friedman, he's not even human to me.
