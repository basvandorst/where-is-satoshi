How much did you sell and how? Is it as simple as selling 1M$ on coinbase going to your bank account?
@_date: 2017-12-22 17:20:06
I sold a bit in the past and got more than my investment back. At the same time, I think about the money I left on the table by selling early when BTC was in the $3000.

Why do you assume I am lying?
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:56:30
That's not really important, what's important is not panicking and not selling all your coins.

Actually reloading the form fixed the issue, maybe some javascript error.
@_date: 2018-08-24 18:12:24
Are you selecting cash or BTC proceedings?
@_date: 2018-08-05 17:40:23
This was agreed early on because the software is new and it's better to be safe while ironing out bugs

Update, I was able to submit the claim and select BTC for returns.
@_date: 2018-08-24 18:04:38
I was able to connect and setup two factor auth but can't submit the claim form, it's greyed out.

It took me a long time to understand the title didn't say "left in lambo" but "left in limbo".... One letter makes a huge difference :)

Wow, I wonder how this was made? Some kind of retro game maker?

Exactly what happened to me. i just got back from Europe, couldn't sleep, got a tweet notification and acted on it while half awake. Won't do that again for sure but certainly a different part of my brain got activated instead of critical thinking.
@_date: 2018-10-20 15:21:02
No I didn't show any address on my post for obvious privacy reasons. The website shows different addresses, they don't use only one.
@_date: 2018-10-20 14:59:19
nope, this is real... I know sounds crazy and absurd to me now...
@_date: 2018-10-20 14:00:00
yep.... 
@_date: 2018-10-20 15:21:57
No a pity post since I didn't put any address in OP
@_date: 2018-10-20 13:59:51
Yeah, I was half awake, saw the series of tweets and damn do I feel like an idiot now
@_date: 2018-10-20 14:18:55
You can start weeping...
@_date: 2018-10-20 14:19:52
... too soon :)
@_date: 2018-10-21 01:15:38
How do I do that without giving out my BTC address?
@_date: 2018-10-20 14:19:27
lol, you know next time I'll have coffee first, no way I make the same mistake after a cup of coffee

The NSA was able to the use the 'writer invariant' method of stylometry to compare Satoshi's 'known' writings with trillions of writing samples from people across the globe...
@_date: 2017-08-29 04:11:16
Yes, they should at least confirm who's not Satoshi.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:26:59


I don't understand how they make the difference betweem dormant adresses and lost private keys.
@_date: 2019-01-25 00:13:07
in the case of bodily harm, they will simply believe you don't want to give them your coins and possibly harm you even more. Timelock would not help.
@_date: 2019-01-24 23:03:29
Thieves meaning someone who gets a copy of the private keys?
@_date: 2017-09-26 21:45:47
It's been years...

Why PETRO?
During the last 4 years Venezuela has experienced the biggest financial crisis in its history, a situation that has resulted in a devaluation of its national currency, the bolivar.
Within the framework of policies to strengthen monetary sovereignty and promote welfare by bringing power closer to its citizens, the government of the Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela has decided to embark on an ambitious project for the future, with the vision of turning the country into a blockchain-based solutions development hub for emerging economies.
The Petro will be the foundation of a policy to promote development, infrastructure and training of young people in electronic mining, coding, cryptography, network security and economics 4.0, that will enable the exploitation of Venezuela and other developing countries’ most valuable assets in a new world of transparent, deconcentrated and manipulation-free markets, all thanks to technology.

So how are you getting your money out? What about mortgages?
