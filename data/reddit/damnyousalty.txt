I had a 400$ transaction that was sent in 2 seconds with a fee of 63 cents.

Roger is nothing but a shill. He has no technical experience at all. If you've been here since day 1 of August and watched everything play out, he has manipulated many users and basically made a cult.He even said Jihan was satoshi which is a complete obvious lie.  
  
Roger has been manipulating new users and tricking them into thinking BCH is the real bitcoin meanwhile BCH is a forked alt coin by consensus rules, in other words it's a fact that it's not bitcoin. His manipulation has gone so far that he bought the domain "bitcoin.com" to further try and push this bullshit agenda. I mean come on dude, look at where they reside, in a sub called "BTC" which is the acronym for Bitcoin. If that was a serious project they would have their own sub...BCH... but obviously it's not a respected project.  
  
Everytime someone calls him out on youtube or any live stream he starts crying and whining and shaming people, his acts are foolish and immature.  
  
He's the only thing keeping BCH going meanwhile he has no technical experience. What a joke. All he's doing is taking advantage of marketing schemes to get richer, he's just some douche bag who got lucky by buying bitcoins years ago and got rich and now he's trying to get richer by fooling people.  
  
Nobody would have a problem with BCH if it weren't for his pathetic schemes. You don't see anybody bashing the other bitcoin forks.  
  
The other side will tell you "oh this is what satoshi really visioned for bitcoin" That's how they started luring people in and then it advanced to "oh the original bitcoin is outdated and slow and expensive" So basically they rely on stealing users from here, where as the original bitcoin just continues to be bitcoin (:

that's one of the worst visions I have ever seen on here for a while. Are you smoking crack?

Don't worry man, some whales will do it for us in a matter of 2-3 weeks

It depends how you use them. Sometimes you use caps to make a certain word more clear when you want to exaggerate. Regardless no reason to get butthurt.

Only other coin I hold other than bitcoin is Vechain. They have a platform that has something different to offer to businesses.

because of the noobs who tell other noobs about it.
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:45:54
yes they did.... I was here for all of it and even remember how many members we had in this community. It was around 280k subs.
@_date: 2018-02-14 03:10:00
actually when the fork was happening majority of users did refer to it as Bcash. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 07:44:47
I don't really care if you use caps

The only thing I didn't like is the horrible advice they gave as to how to learn about this field. They should have gave better advice such as do your own research and understand how these transactions work, how to learn about wallets and private keys etc...

you're definitely smoking crack. The point was your vision is so far off and utterly foolish. We are way closer to a bull run than a land slide. Anyone with common sense in the crypto game knows this.  
  
The smoking crack part was a joke, why would you even look for a connection? /facepalm.

Caps don't mean he's yelling. That's just how you perceived it.
