Can we have some directions on how to setup read-only API access?
I've looked at Binance and I think you do it like this:
User (person icon) -&gt; account -&gt; API settings -&gt; enter API label -&gt; 2fa authentication -&gt; edit -&gt; uncheck enable trading and enable withdrawals (should be unchecked already) -&gt; save -&gt;2fa authentication. 
Is this correct for Binance? 
Also for Cryptopia I think it's like this:
User -&gt; account -&gt; enter pin -&gt; API settings -&gt; check enable API -&gt; ensure enable withdrawal and allow unsafe withdraw are unchecked -&gt; click new key -&gt; click save.
Is this correct for Cryptopia? I cannot see any option to disable trading via the API. That bothers me.

Litecoin usually lags behind Bitcoin. It did the same thing in the last bull run, it lost ground to Bitcoin for week or months then made it all back up it in like a day. Litecoin acts differently than shitcoins because it trades against USD directly on many exchanges where shitcoin almost always trade against only Bitcoin and/or cyrptos.

Doing the work to legitimately mine coins when the difficulty is low is not pre-mining. It's just mining. 


The Bitcoin Core developers cannot make any changes to the Bitcoin protocol without cooperation of the miners. While the same may seem to be true with Ethereum there is such a cult of personality around Vitalik that for the most part what he says goes. The Bitcoin miners very much do not feel that way about Bitcoin Core developers.


Rolling back the Blockchain because of a bug or an invalid transaction that fundamentally undermines the entire system is not the same as doing it to revert a valid transaction because some people made a poor decision (ie. investing money in a poorly DAO). Remember, the DOA had a bug not the Ethereum code.

It may be regional but could also just be the particular dealer you going to. Also if you are going to buy coins you should choose ones minted in or near the country where you live.

No it doesn't work like that. Something can only ever lose all of it's value which is 100%. As for adding up reduction, in order for that to add up to more than 100% it must go up in between which wipes out the previous loss and re establishes the new 100% value.

Junk silver (and I think gold) is a term used for old coins that were used as money back when the world still worked on the gold standard. For example US coins minted before 1965 are 90% silver. Junk silver is also sometimes called spending silver or constitutional silver (for US coins). 
You basically confirm they silver because they are government minted coins from before a certain date.

You can buy shares in a gold or silver trust yes but that doesn't protect you from the new bail in laws or other forms of confiscation. Also those holdings may be affected if negative interest rates are ever instituted. 
Holding gold shares is probably a good idea as a hedge against inflation but you might want to consider holding some physical gold and silver in case a far more dire circumstances like the collapse of the world financial system. 
Also gold is quite high right now (maybe even at all time highs) so you keep that in mind too.

Banks have quite high premiums on precious metals, try to avoid buying from them. Find a reputable dealer locally or online and they'll sell you gold and silver at much lower markup. They will also buy your gold at or very near spot price. Heck there is even a "we buy gold" place in my city that will pay spot for silver and gold. 
Also the smaller bar the more premium you'll pay. A 1/10ozt bar will cost more per ounce than a 1ozt bar which will cost more than  a 10ozt bar etc.


Did you buy some sort of collectors item (numismatic) bar or coin? Stay away from numismatics unless you really know what you are doing. You should be looking to buy and sell at as close to spot as possible.

The sad thing is if you try to explain the current monetary system to the average person they think you are totally crazy.

Blockchain is a BS marketing term that "respectable" business people use because they are afraid to say Bitcoin. What does "invest in blockchain" even mean if you aren't buying Bitcoin, buying shitcoins? 
A blockchain is really just a ledger or database that is broken up into number chunks or blocks. While it is one of the technologies that Bitcoin relies on it is nothing new or anything particularly special. The same goes for public/private key encryption, hugely important to the functioning of Bitcoin but nothing new or special . The newly invented (at the time) enabling technology that allowed for the invention of  Bitcoin was the proof of work distributed consensus algorithm. That is the real secrets sauce behind how Bitcoin works.

The difference is that when the government decides to invade another country the military is obligated to go drop bombs on people. When the Fed lowers interest rates no one is obligated to take out loans. People choose to take out loans because the cost of those loans has gone down but no one is forced. 
Of course the Fed lowers interest rates with the intention of creating new money to be injected into the economy but is done by persuasion instead of command. People could choose not to take out loans and in fact we are starting to see that as lowering the interest rates is having less and less of an effect the more they do it.

It's not that it's based on nothing and in fact that's not really true. It is based on debt, ie. debt based fiat. 
When you sign a loan agreement the money you are borrowing is conjured into existence. Unfortunately only the principal of the loan is created and not the interest which mean you need to go take money from someone else in order to cover the interest part of the loan. There is not enough money in the entire system to cover the amount of debt. Our entire economy exists in the gap between people borrowing money and people paying it back and because there isn't enough money in the system to cover it all the economy must keep growing or it will fail.

I expect the particulars of this would be completely lost on law enforcement and/or law makers but transporting a hardware wallet doesn't equate to transporting Bitcoin. In fact transporting Bitcoin isn't even possible. Bitcoin isn't a thing that you can hold or move from one place to another. Bitcoin is a service that you access and your private key is just the address of where your information is stored by that service. 
Asking someone if they have any Bitcoin on them makes as little sense as asking someone if they have any internet on them.

That sounds so simple, here's my credit card.

I actually think the 2017 bull run started with widespread ransomware attacks. Remember there were quite a few large companies that got hit with ransomware all around the same time. Those companies needed to buy considerable amounts of Bitcoin to pay off the ransomers.

Shout out to whoever is going to buy at $250k. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 19:50:45
Nope, just that a ransomware attack is one of many ways to get the ball rolling.

"Some bank branches going cashless"
Firstly, WTF. 
Second, this is good for Bitcoin.

For clarification, when the article talks about "order number" does it mean the number of word in your recovery seed (ie. 12, 18, or 24)? 
@_date: 2018-07-27 20:24:52
We all know what that means, right? 
@_date: 2018-07-03 16:06:19
This post seems like a pretty straight forward statement of fact. There is no mention of a war on Bitcoiners or any conspiracy between the banks and airport security. 
If you dispute factual accuracy of the statement say that but don't build straw men for you to attack.

Blockchain is what "respectable people" say because they are scared to say Bitcoin. 
Real answer - a blockchain is simply a ledger. People talk about it like it is the secret sauce that makes Bitcoin work. This isn't true because humanity has had ledgers for as long we've had writing. The real enabling technology behind Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is the distributed consensus algorithm, proof of work in the case of Bitcoin.

You guys are making me feel good about my position.

I mean sure I could but I wouldn't want to step on your toes.

I'd hope the certificate warning would be a big enough red flag to stop me. Failing that, asking me to enter my seed words in to the computer likely would have clued me in. 
I can't however rule out that this might have caught me if I was having a particularly absent minded day. This is one reason I try not to access my wallet when I don't need to, and "I just want to check on it" is not a good reason.

Unless you track your coins against bitcoin. "Hey look Litecoin just went from 0.017 BTC to 0.017 BTC".

What you said is correct and is what I mean when I say "removing heat". When I say "adding cool" however I am talking about refrigeration in the form of air conditioning. Many people think the way to deal heat loads is to seal the room up and run an air conditioner but often it is cheaper and more effective to remove the heat with airflow.

I wish Mcaffee the antivirus would change its name as it is reason people still recognize Mcaffee the person. Then Mcaffee the person could fade away into obscurity where he belongs.

Congratulations! Now delete this post and stop telling people about it.

So if when Mcafee says he'll "eat his dick" he means he'll procure the services of a prostitute, what does it mean when you say you'll "procure the services of a prostitute"?

OMG shhh! Don't let Bitcoin hear you say that, it might get ideas.

Not enough people understand this. Keeping equipment cool is more about removing heat than adding cool.

If you'd bought $100 you would probably have sold at $500. Not only did you need the foresight to buy back then you also needed the foresight to hodl.

I think unless there is serious pull back to 4k within the next month we'll leave 4k in the dust never to be seen again.

Bitcoin reaches $1 million USD per coin. Surprise twist, USD is so inflated it cost $100 000 for a loaf of bread.
