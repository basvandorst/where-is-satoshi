I agree. They accumulate silently, sell big (in a few months), scare folks into selling, buy more, and gain more control over price....when i say they, im referring to the bad people. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:46:33
Its a good time. Bitcoin is here to stay-for good. In the short-term, the price of bitcoin could fall-but the amount of bitcoin you bought will never go down. Over the next 5-20 years you'll be glad you bought some. Those that do will proudly say, "I got into bitcoin when it was below 20K." Think of Saudi Princes, Russian Oligarchs, and people like Donald Trump. When they do an international business deal, they will do anything to cut costs and increase security. Bitcoin is for them and b/c of that a price of 1mm per bitcoin is not out of the question. Even if it hits a mere 50K, you still made an excellent return on your money. I bet it will hit 100k per bitcoin by 2019. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:20:27
That is completely normal, do not worry. It will arrive seven days from when you initiated the order. (I've made 10 plus transfers over the past month without a hitch). 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:03:23
no prob! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:44:23
Very true.Take away: high transaction fees and slow transactions are here to stay. Some will argue lightening network. 
However, per the podcast (and my opinion), bitcoin transactions will be limited to the most valuable, important, and largest transactions in the future. Therefore, there is no problem with high transactions because fees will be small in comparison to the size of the transaction. 
Further, there will be no problem with speed b/c only 400K transactions will take place each day (so speed will be fast). This also solves the electricity problem. 
Another currency will be used for micro-transactions. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:16:12
Yes, that is correct, only applies to real property.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:14:41
No, because it is a gift. :) (ideally, he would pay tax on any gain if/when he sold the bitcoin for cash-that’s called realizing the gain and is taxable to your bro) 
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:11:12
Wrong. An exchange for a specific type of asset is not what creates the taxable event. Its the exchange itself as it is much broader than that. Realization is what creates a taxable event. Whether its a car, a lap-dance, the yen or the USD, any change of BTC to another asset will create a taxable event. (Assuming the IRS knows about it). 
@_date: 2017-12-09 08:23:30
Yes, because options are a zero sum game.

This is the best post I've ever laid my eyes on. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:48:10
Your capital gains is 10K if you sold your entire holding. To use your entire basis you need to sell your entire holding. If not, you can only use that proportion of your basis. Assuming you sold your entire holding, You realized 10K of gain, you pay taxes on that. Your basis starts over at 5K. Im not entirely following, but just remember you cant use your basis twice... Edit: your question changed, so just to clarify. You pay taxes on 10K that was a taxable event. When you buy back in, you have started a new basis of 5K. If you sell for ten, your basis is 5, you pay tax on 5 :)
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:57:18
Thats for institutions. An individual does not have access to that platform. However, a customer of Ameritrade can trade futures on CBOE VIA* ameritrade platform. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:14:34
Yes, trading between currencies creates a taxable event. The moment you sell, exchange, or trade one crypto for another crypto, a lap-dance, a car, or a USD, that creates a taxable event.
Although one may cleverly argue that trading one crypto for another crypto is akin to trading one piece of land for another piece of land...and that is not taxable under I.R.C. 1031, this only applies to real property.
Bitcoin is treated as property for federal tax purposes under IRS Notice 2014-21, but it is NOT "real property."  There is a distinction.

Hey Man, I was wrong-you were right. Sorry for the headache. If you receive property for services, include the property's FMV in income. The amount you include in income becomes your basis. FMV =6K, Basis =6K. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:11:55
There is a winner and a loser. Someone offers to buy and someone offers to sell bitcoin at a price in the future. There is no actual exchange of bitcoin between the buyer and seller on the final settlement date (Four weeks from today). However, the buyer and the seller settle up at the end of each day in cash. Future to buy bitcoin at 15,000 and the price at the end of the day is 16,000, seller's loss is 1,000 and buyer's gain is a 1,000 (in their accounts at each's brokerage firm). This happens every day until final settlement. Seller here looses b/c they offered to sell it for 15,000 but it costs 16,000 now. Many sellers who are short like this will buy the underlying asset to hedge themselves. There is still no transfer of bitcoin, but the seller gains on the increase in the price of the bitcoin - the amount they lost to the buyer.

Hodl, Sir. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:39:37
IRS will probably only audit the big fish. If I recall correctly, Coinbase, for example is turning over info regarding customers who made transfers in excess of 20k. Those customers will certainly be charged short term cap gains rate unless they can prove otherwise. Its not likely the irs would audit the smaller players-and paying a 15% would probably get a small fish audited bec it puts them
On the map. Paying taxes doesn’t always support a good faith defense. Especially if there was a fraudulent motive. (Paying 15% knowing you owe more in hopes of not getting audited is not good faith). Edit: they would likely only know if you were reported by your bank or an exchange like Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:24:18
Glad you stand by your statement. I bet you relish in the opportunity to talk about your buy-in price. No mistake, don’t assume. It’s called a Roman numeral. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:56:52
You pay tax on the 1,000 because that is a taxable event, you "realized" a gain of 1,000 minus whatever your basis was. Its not profitable in this case. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:52:14
Keep you’re own records. Save screen shots of dollars you paid for bitcoin. That’s your basis-don’t want to loose your basis! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:58:32
Please do not waste your time creating an account at CBOE. As an individual you cannot trade directly through the CBOE website. However, they have great information regarding the futures contract specifications. Create an account at Ameritrade. There is one other brokerage firm also allowing their customers to trade XBT (forget the name). I know that Fidelity and Scottrade do NOT. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 00:56:02
You can trade bitcoin futures (XBT) right now Ameritrade. During the account opening process you must apply for a margin account-which is easy to apply for and receive.

First in First Out Method is required by the IRS. BTC purchased earlier are the ones that you sold. BTC FMV -BTC Cost = Tax. Your BTC Cost is what you paid for it. If you cannot find the cost, you can attempt to find the FMV at that time by a listing on an exchange. Without documentation (transaction order or receipt) you bear the burden of proving your cost basis to the IRS. They do not have to accept it and you could pay tax on the entire BTC.

I use coinbase. Its pretty easy although some people say its fees are higher. Once you send your bitcoin to coinbase, you can convert it to USD (fee)-- there is no fee to send USD to bank account. It took two days, they disclaim 2-4 business days i think.

They are responsible because they are a custodian. There'd be a lawsuit and a recovery based on their insurance and goddamn money they have in their account. :) Crypto is part of the future and coinbase wants to be in that biz, whehter exchanging BTC or other alts-so they have a rep to uphold. Wallet is better.

The creation of Futures for cotton (1850) and later oil and gold led to a stability in price and later to the creation of ETFs for each commodity (the ultimate investment tool that will lead to mass adoption). A crypto currency ETF or a bitcoin ETF based on multiple exchange prices would be ideal to truly diversify ones portfolio of investments. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:50:07
I can tell you with certainty that when you trade 1 BTC for 100XMR you pay taxes (if there is a gain). When you cash it out 3 year laters into USD, you pay taxes (if there is a gain). Unless an exception applies, an exchange of BTC for goods, services, other coins creates a taxable event. IRS Notice 2014-21. 
Also, cashing out your BTC and going back into BTC creates a taxable event. Even if you re-purchase a second later b/c it is a taxable event. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:16:31
Agreed. Shorters will still buy long to cover their short, increasing volume, decreasing supply, raising price-at least in the short term. Futures are a precursor to other investment products like ETFS-which would blow bitcoin out of the water (upward In price)...the reason why futures are a precursor is because they have a way of determining the true price of the underlying asset and decreasing volatility (after a while).....stocks, cotton, and oil are good examples.  
Edit: yes, futures are settled in cash. But wouldnt shorters  still buy the underlying asset to protect themselves? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:25:23
Your brother pays tax if he sells. He gets your basis (the principle you injected). If you don't keep track, and your bro has no record, the IRS will assume zero basis. Your bro has presumption to prove basis. You need documentation of when you purchased the bitcoin with USD or whatever currency used, such as a screenshot of the transaction, bank debit, something. Take Away: You do not pay tax.

This is kind of what happens when people short stocks. But this is not the case with bitcoin right now. When shorting bitcoins thru futures, there is no actual exchange of a physical bitcoin. The people who contract together via future (buyer and seller (aka short) settle each day in cash. Therefore, there is no need to borrow a physical bitcoin.

sounds like "beginner to intermediate knowledge" is an over-statement 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:06:51
Since you are not selling all of your BTC, the IRS requires you to use "first in first out." Which means, the first BTC you bought is the BTC you are selling. Did you start buying bitcoin over a year ago? If so, its long-term capital gains. The price you paid for the BTC is your cost baasis. Dont remember what you paid? Likely, the IRS would accept or argue the FMV of a bitcoin from an exchange at that time....if one existed. Selling price - Basis (FMV at purchase) = taxable event..Purchased over 1 year ago? Preferential capital gain tax treatment. Not held for over one year? Short term cap gain rate. Remember: First bitcoin you bought is the first bitcoin you sold. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:10:29
Settlement happens everyday not Just end date.-in cash. Therefore, the difference between a future and actually buying the underlying asset thru Coinbase is the massive amount of leverage. The two parties stand to gain or loose a hell of a lot more. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:48:07

Screen shot your purchases (transactions). I could not imagine an agent not accepting the cash amount as basis. Pretty sure any penalty would be separate from zero basis.

@_date: 2017-12-08 21:55:26
Wouldn't shorters first want to entice people to enter the future contracts and go long with bitcoin? In other words, couldn't we could expect a bull run starting Monday followed by heavy price-manipulation, selling of bitcoin, shorting, as future contracts become due over the next 3, 6, 9, months... (Maybe you're right they dont have the funds to drive the price down)..If the bitcoin market dumps on monday nobody is gonna enter into any futures and shorters are not going to make any money...

A person is taxed when a GAIN is REALIZED. A gain is realized whether the underlying asset (here bitcoin) was used to purchase a car, pay for a lap dance, or converted into yen or USD. Its the realization that causes the tax event--not whatever the asset was converted into.

He was given BTC as compensation for his business. Therefore, the BTC is taxed as income at his ordinary rate because it is gross income. IRC § 61(a). The tax paid becomes his basis in the BTC when he later sells. IRC §1012.

Does anyone know what has happened to commodities after futures for the commodities are introduced? According to Investopedia, the first futures for cotton were implemented in 1850 and 1870. The following unverified link, from 2002, sheds light on the volatility in cotton (scroll down to response). Then, around the time futures were introduced, cotton prices dropped (rebounded years later) and volatility decreased. (First part of this link). I'm not saying or arguing this will happen to bitcoin (Hodl), just wanted to share this information.

It wont be used for micro-transactions (not everyone shares this belief). I just don't see it necessary to use the worlds safest and fastest medium of exchange to buy a cup of coffee or toothpaste. These transactions will get priced out due to high fees. In the future, bitcoin will only be used for the most important and largest financial transactions. Think Russian oligarchs, Saudi Princes, and Donald Trump Types-if theres a buck to be saved--they will save it. Another currency will be used for micro transactions. That currency will be the oil of the digital currency economy while bitcoin will be the gold. Most of these ideas I heard in this podcast.

You pay taxes on the BTC, on this years tax return, at your ordinary individual taxable rate.
The purpose of BTC will determine its tax treatment. First, if you buy BTC for yourself, its treated as property and you will pay the long term or short term capital gain tax rate, as discussed above. 
To your current question. You did not buy BTC for yourself. Therefore, you are not afforded long-term or short term capital gain treatment. 
You received the BTC in question as compensation for your online web design business. Under IRC 61, receiving property in exchange for services performed is compensation. That compensation is taxed at your ordinary tax rate as income. Even though you did not sell it. Also, if you own the place (your business), in addition to the BTC being taxed at your ordinary rate, you also owe self-employment tax on the bitcoin. 
Why are you taxed even though you didnt sell it? Because it was compensation for services rendered.

Worst Case Scenario: Ten years from now you dont know how much you purchased it for. Now that there are so many exchanges, the IRS would likely work with you and allow you to use the FMV of a coin purchased on 12/15/17 based off an exchanges price. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:19:03
The basis for the new asset is its cost basis. What did it cost you? It cost you the fmv of the asset you exchanged for the new asset. So, the FMV of the exchanged currency is your cost basis in the new currency. Its price is the FMA at the time of selling. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:30:02

Allows for more transactions using bitcoin to take place faster. Right now only 400K transactions using bitcoin can take place daily. Seems like a lot-its not.

Futures are good. Futures increase volume of the underlying asset and lead to price stability. Examples: Cotton, wheat, oil, and gold. Futures are also a precursor to the creation of ETFs. Once an ETF is formed on bitcoin, the investment into crypto becomes widespread driving up price and leading to true diversification of ones's investment portfolio. Wouldn't it be nice to have an ETF in an IRA that tracked the price of bitcoin on multiple exchanges or an ETF of crypto in general?
