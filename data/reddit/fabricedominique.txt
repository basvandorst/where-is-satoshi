OK some news from Kraken official status. 
A small amount of deposits sent to our bank Fidor after Tuesday, Dec 05 are delayed. All delayed transfers will be credited as soon as Fidor fixes the issue.

I just got my money. I recommend you to do a lot of twits about it. I just got my money credited finally. Put the kraken ceo in every tweet. Don’t give up and all will be fine. Also I asked my bank to fax the kraken bank to confirm the wire info. Good luck mate.

I know. it's not my fault. I insisted with my bank so they had it but they did not do it properly. it's really sad :(
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:41:47
I got my money !!!!! Thank you everyone!!!!

it's seems that there is a big problem with kraken bank which name is FIDOR in germany. I'm not the only one... 
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:27:49
posting here will help. Kraken is a honest company. I'm sure they will solve it. it's not an investment, it's just a wire to respected company. thank you for the support mate.

Kraken-frank I'm in the exact situation with euro account FIDOR. Kraken Support Ticket Number: 1024750 . what is going on? are you going out of business?

thank you! so Coibase is going to use segwit and bitlfyer also use segwit. there is no option to choose any fees, so in this case is the segwit faster between these 2 marketplaces?
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:54:03
How fast is a segwit bitcoin transfer ?
