When displayed, show the values in BTC, mBTC, and Satoshis and their respective current values.  Over the course of time and usage, the preferable version will make itself known. 
In addition, while this weeding-out is taking place, people will have a better grasp of what BTC is worth in their fiat of choice.
This process will take quite a few years to come to completion, but it will happen!

I'm running Ubuntu 16.04 on a RPi3 and for whatever reason, it will NOT upgrade from 15.01!  I have the ppa from Bitcoin.org.  Any ideas?
@_date: 2018-09-28 20:29:34
I am running a node on a Raspberry Pi3 and it won't update to 0.16.3 because, according to the PPA, the 0.16.3 for armhf has failed.
I would love to update, but I can't right now!

I have to admit that I *still* don't know what this thing is supposed to do.
@_date: 2018-09-29 14:24:43
I'm sure that I am not the only one, so the steps to do what you mentioned would be very helpful!

[ELI5]  With all of the positive buzz about the Copay app, I decided to download it and take a look. 
It seems like an ordinary wallet to me, but I know that there is more under the hood, but I don't understand how to use it!
So, ELI5, how to implement the multi-sig aspect of Copay, and how to use it/maintain it effectively.  I say this because without clear instructions and maybe some hand-holding, it's confusing!
Maybe there is some brave soul that could make an "instruction manual" so that just about anyone could get Copay and starting using it features and services without being a super-nerd. ;)
I am not a novice with computers, but the amount of jargon that goes with Bitcoin/Blockchain/Security can be mind-boggling.  It's seems that Copay could be the app that has both security and relative-simplicity.  It just needs a little help.

Underhill's Games in Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio has been accepting Bitcoin since the beginning of the year.  They do sell M:TG, tons of board games, RPGS, and tons of accessories!

Thanks!  I'll look forward to it!

I love the "snitches get stitches" comment from Karp Markeles.  Priceless.

I have been listening to the new Mastodon album, "Once More Round the Sun" constantly.  Definitely try out the first two tracks, "Tread Lightly" and "The Motherload"

Great reply.  You get an upvote and Shitsayer gets another downvote.

Contact the developer directly, Bojan Simic.  He is working on a fix and was able to retrieve my BTC.

What is the estimated amount of time it will take to mine the remaining 20%?  That's the really interesting number.

Good looking widget!  I would like to have access to currencies other than the USD.
@_date: 2019-03-12 20:44:45
These wallets need ELI5 instructions on how to use them, load them, etc.  Don't assume that everyone out there knows how to use this extra layer.

My original statement still applies.
@_date: 2016-06-03 16:05:02
I don't want to be mean, but this is the attitude that slows acceptance.  Elitist and snotty comments help no one.

Does LN *hinder* larger transactions in any way?  If it's good for microtransactions and doesn't matter to larger ones, what's the big deal?

What are the hardware specs that you are using for your full node?
I am interested in starting my own node and your bandwidth usage stat was the one that I thought I would have the toughest time getting!
@_date: 2015-08-03 04:35:27
Soooo....it really doesn't take much on the hardware side, just storage and bandwidth?
Also, what OS are you running?

Is there a way to send the remaining tiny amount in a wallet to the miners?
I have $.37 left in a wallet.  I would rather that go to the miners.

Good luck!

I am pretty sure I'm in the minority here, but does anyone else hate the term HODL like I do?
