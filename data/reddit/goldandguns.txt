It doesn't matter. If I made an ad for nepotism from a western union ad, I'm still liable because I'm the one doing the infringing. Here, the guy who made it is infringing-it's irrelevant that btc isn't a privately owned corporation
You can trash other companies but you can't copy their advertisements for your own

Sorry, you just listed a bunch of random things, with which I think you have little familiarity.

I wasn't even aware you needed a ticket. I thought you just showed up.

I'm telling you that you don't have to be a company to infringe on copyright.

If that's the case, you can't use that evidence. That *never* happens. It's one of the chief reasons we don't/can't prosecute detainees at Guantanamo in civilian courtrooms. You can't say "we got this evidence, but we can't tell you how we got it" no matter how serious the national security implications.

If you actually [read the motion]( you'll see this has nothing to do with "taking control of a drug kingpin's encrypted network," it's about the contents of his laptop. 
The reason I mention Reily is because you spewed some bullshit about how the supreme court is all  "pro-drug war, pro-police, pro-government" and will give "Over Arching Precedent" (not quite sure why you're capitalizing random words, but whatever), while they very recently had a unanymous decision that indicates without exception that police have to get a warrant to search a cell phone. Doesn't sound very "pro-police" to me. It also does have broad implications, as most fourth amendment cases do. It absolutely applies to drug offenders. In that case, the government lost, hence my comment.

Yes, because as we all know, only credible people get constitutional protection. Get real dude

atm's what?
@_date: 2014-08-05 17:02:12
Yeah because it worked out so well for the government in *Riely v. California*.

I use Schwab, and they pay back any atm fees but without the 15 dollar cap.

What the fuck are you talking about? I'm talking about in 2002, when the dust settled and some of these guys wanted trials. I'm talking about guys who had been there a few weeks or months. 
I'm not talking about whether or not "those humans" can be let out in public, I was talking about why the government did not want to prosecute them in a civilian courtroom and why they are instead prosecuted in military tribunals...
@_date: 2014-04-07 13:37:09
I mean, how do I do that. Can you point me to a guide? Every one I've seen leaves me confused
@_date: 2014-08-05 16:58:56
Could you perhaps explain what "claim national security" means?
@_date: 2014-04-07 15:03:45
FWIU, it costs about 4% and doesn't offer much
@_date: 2014-03-23 14:53:43
uh, everything? Supply and demand being one of the most important.
@_date: 2014-08-06 13:07:34
Lemme guess. You're an asshole?
@_date: 2014-08-15 13:56:30
I said a flight, not a trip.

Ditto.

That's not true. There are illegal methods out there; the how absolutely matters. For instance, if you torture someone, the evidence that torture-induced confession/information provides you isn't admissible.

How the hell do I take money from my coinbase account and wash/tumble/mix it before depositing it someplace unsavory, or is this unnecessary? 
@_date: 2014-04-11 02:20:10
Yes, *exactly*. Someone with some perspective can be helpful in calming fears. If I lost my job, my first call would be to a friend who is employed, not someone unemployed.

Well the discussion of the how started because people were talking about how the FBI would need to disclose how they deanonymized Tor in order to bring forth evidence, something they probably won't do but also probably something tney won't have to do.
The real issue, argued in the motion that I'm skimming right now, is that while the government did have a warrant, it was not a valid warrant because it was a "general warrant" which were used extensively in pre-revolution colonies by King George, and which are not permitted, generally speaking (pun?). 
So they're separate issues. The how thing isn't so relevant to the article or the motion being brough

It's actually not parody. It's a joke but it's in no way a parody. It's made to advertise or advocate for BTC. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 20:00:18
Okay you might literally be insane. 
@_date: 2014-08-05 18:55:17
Okay, either read the brief or shut the fuck up. I don't care either way, just stop talking about stuff that's not even a topic of debate in the actual issue being discussed.
@_date: 2014-08-05 17:02:34
Courts do.
Edit: if nothing else, they care more than any other branch of government
@_date: 2014-03-23 22:46:21


That is literally supply and demand. That's how capitalism works.

They never "know" it's going to get thrown out in court. They either don't know it will, hope it won't, or have good belief the court will side with them. It happens all the time though, which is why there are tens of thousands of cases every year where evidence is thrown out due to fourth amendment violations.
What makes you think it's going to be permitted "this time"? Courts can't just ignore rules of evidence; if they do the decisions just get appealed up and then tossed out, and the judge who fucked up gets a shitty reputation.

Production cost is almost the least important aspect of valuing a pill of any kind.

I fucking hate it when people cite to the tulip bubble. It was 400 fucking years ago. There have been bubbles since.
