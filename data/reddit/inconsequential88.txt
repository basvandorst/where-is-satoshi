I added them to my bookmark, thanks!

Wait, now that I think about it. How fucked will I be for refusing/avoiding to give up my privacy? Because as far as I know the reason why it's enforced is to prevent money laundering and terrorists. I am neither, therefore I am not breaking the law right?

I included the YT video incase someone didn't know what I was talking about, but if a shortcut to solve complex problems is solved, wouldn't that break the major security rule of bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-11-29 02:36:11
Really? How exactly would it not be affected? Because I thought if P=NP is solved and it's easy to verify the signature of a hidden key then it would also be easy to find that hidden key right?

Current hashrate is around 45 terrahashes if my estimations are correct. So with 1 rasb. Pi that would be 200 Hashes/45,000,000,000,000 Hashes or a 00.0000000004% chance....
I may have gotten my math wrong but wow thats a very low chance.
@_date: 2018-11-29 04:12:11
That's exactly what I was trying to understand, thank you.
Now I wonder if quantum cryptocurrencies will be a thing...
@_date: 2018-11-21 00:17:31
But what if I get caught? D:
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:30:01
Yeah if bitcoin takes off then the early investors will def benefit from it. But I don't think keeping quiet about it is a good idea, the more support the better.
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:37:07
I know right, I can't wait for it to be used as a standard currency.
However, aren't there only a finite amount of bitcoins?
And once the supply of bitcoins runs out there won't be any more. Drastically increasing the value ot bitcoin.

Cool, someone else aleady messaged me about the ATM's but thanks for that app, I'm installing it now.
@_date: 2018-11-22 01:16:37
8000 years? Might as well just pool mine then.
But I'm still going to try solo mining just for the off chance.
Even if its astronomically low.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:25:36
Woah, never knew they were actually a thing. I checked a map and there's a bunch in in my area. They do have high fees but the simplicity seems worth it.
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:05:00
Sorry I didn't mean to sound stupid, I'm actually being serious. I just don't trust anyone with my personal info, there's been too many large corporations that have been hacked and peoples personal data stolen. I don't want to risk my identity being stolen or be accused of something I didn't do. I know it sounds rather paranoid but I'd rather be wrong than regretful.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:46:26
More like my parents garage T_T
But nah, it's more complex than that.
Probably the best thing to do is to stay in line for now.
@_date: 2018-11-20 23:28:54
Noob here. Anyone here know how or where to buy crypto coins without having to upload my personal info? (I'm in the US)
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:46:48
Oh cool. so what would happen if say I had a thousand rasberry pi's solo mining? Or what if I virtualized a million processes to mine at a reduced speed?
Is it just based on hash power meaning the dice gets re rolled faster, or is it based on pure chance where multiple processes means multiple dice rolls at the same time?
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:20:59
Yeah that's what I'm going to do instead. However, I'm gonna' work on a small solar mining farm just for the off chance the lord decides to be generous lol.
@_date: 2018-11-25 03:30:25
If you can afford the hardware and electricity price then go for it, even though its cheaper to straight up buy it.
You can at least still earn some bitcoin.

@_date: 2018-11-21 02:23:39
Cool, I'll check it out. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-11-22 15:17:30
Yeah, it's like a mathematically impossible chance. But because of the way it works in the real world, it can happen at any moment. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:34:04
Tax return? oof, there goes a list of more subjects I need to look in to
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:19:22
Wait, seriously? I'ma look that up right now.

Awesome, I never knew normal computers could "fight" against quantum computers.
