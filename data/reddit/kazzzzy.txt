Makes sense why the price is going down. I also have a feeling ever since Bitcoin has been gaining attention and being adopted by huge companies like paypal, they are selling their coins as soon as they get them. Making fiat more valuable then bitcoin.

I mean you can always *save your Taco Bells Bitcoin address (*which to me is the inconvenience,) and pay without even handing them your phone, but what about other places? I mean maybe if all vendors have a signed and authorized bitcoin address it could work, but I mean, shouldn't something like this digital currency be more convenient as say a credit card for instance(where you can just hand them the card and scan it?) You never know where or what you could buy at the given moment. :E

Good luck trying to tax something completely anonymous.
Only thing they can really do is tax the people converting their bitcoins into their countries currency (whether it be USD, EURO, etc.)
Other than that, purchasing goods with bitcoin ONLY, they can't do nothing about that.

In all honesty I think it won't be a great idea to start demanding physical coins. 
History shows us that when 'coins' was the form of currency back in the days, it was really inconvenient because of the weight it distributed. 
That is why they came out the the dollar; its light and more convenient to carry large sums of it without ripping your pants off.
 I think bitcoin should stay where it is at now online, which is def more convenient. :)

13.1 Buyer Protection Programs. If you buy an item using PayPal and either do not receive the item or receive an item that you believe is Significantly Not as Described by the seller, we encourage you to open a Dispute with the seller in our Resolution Center. By doing so, you will initiate our Online Dispute Resolution Process—a step-by-step system designed to facilitate communication between you and the seller in order to get resolution of the issue. If your dialogue with the seller fails to produce a satisfactory result, you can then escalate the Dispute into a Claim that we will evaluate for reimbursement under one of the following programs: (When a buyer -- or a scammer -- utilizes these options, it will eventually lead to the limitation or freezing of somebody's account)
PayPal Buyer Complaint Policy - Our best efforts program to reimburse Users for losses only to the extent we are able to recover the funds from sellers.(There it is. PayPal will not cover buyer losses if they are unable to get the money back from the seller. If a buyer has been scammed by a seller that PayPal itself has verified, PayPal will not cover your losses)
PayPal Buyer Protection Policy - Our program to reimburse Users for losses for up to (i) $2,000.00 USD (Top Tier Coverage Amount) for eligible items purchased on eBay and (ii) up to $200.00 USD (Basic Tier Coverage Amount) for all other eligible items purchased on eBay and for eligible items purchased outside of eBay that PayPal processed through the ATM debit network. Please see section 13.9 to determine whether Top Tier Coverage Amount or Basic Tier Coverage Amount applies to your eBay purchase. (Again, this is meaningless. PayPal has already said that whatever protection you do have is only based on PayPal's ability to get the money back from the seller!)
Buyer Protection for eBay Express - Our program to reimburse Users for the full amount of losses for items purchased on eBay Express.
Extended Buyer Protection with PayPal Credit - Our program to reimburse Users for the full amount of losses for items purchased using the PayPal Credit Card or PayPal Buyer Credit. (Federal consumer laws come into play here. PayPal must cover all losses in THIS CASE because a credit card was being used -- in this case a credit card issued by PayPal)
These programs only cover payments for tangible, physical goods. All other payments, such as payments for intangibles, services, airline flight tickets, or licenses and other access to digital content are not covered by any Buyer Protection Program that we offer (but may be covered by Chargeback rights). (PayPal limits protection to "physical goods." If you bought a website domain name, web design work, an ebook, etc. you are not covered. HOWEVER, if paid using a credit card, then you are covered with your credit card. However, as you will see later, if you use your legal consumer rights and do a chargeback, you risk your account getting limited, frozen or suspended!)
This conflicts with the 45 day rule because you NEVER received your item for who knows how long.

Butterflylabs has a backlog of ASIC orders since June of last year. Ever since then, they have been stating false information about delivery dates of their products. People have been asking for their refund, however, since they (BFL) were stating false information about how they were going to "deliver in two weeks" for more the 5 months, People who have paid through Paypal fell into the trap of "no refunds" after 45 days. Now the people who have ordered are stuck and couldn't seem to find a way to get their money back. Hence this reason for this post.

Basically the only thing I see as a valid argument on bitcoin is the limited supply. Eventually all the bitcoins will be minted and its all hoarding after that. 
Thing is, what makes bitcoin so valuable is the whole idea of crypto-currency and not being regulated by the hungry elephants we call 'banks.' 
But it doesn't stop there.
Litecoin is an example of the same idea of cryto-currency (making it AS valuable) but with more litecoins being available. 
Other than that, 
1) There r services like escrow that provide buyer/seller protection from scams and such. 
2) As far as illegal usage if bitcoins, which currency isn't used for illegal reasons?
3) It being an actual legitimized currency depends on how popular it becomes with merchants and buyers.
The only thing that can kill bitcoin is the community; Hoarding coins and trading them in for USD/EURO is an example. As long as we have merchants accepting bitcoins and people using bitcoin for everyday purchases is what will make this first crypto-currency flourish.

My guess is miners are cashing out, especially the ones from BFL who r JUST getting theirs and want to break even with their equipment.

"These are bankers from the now infamous Anglo Irish Bank. This bank wasnt a normal bank. It did not have tellers instead it was sort of an investment bank and as you will all know went apeshit with property. It lent billions to developers and property speculators.
In Ireland it has been said that this bank had very close relationships with the biggest political party in the state, Fianna Fail.
The recordings are from the treasury dept of the bank. All phone calls in and out of bank treasury dept. are recorded for obvious records of transactions and regularity compliance.
This tapes along with many thousands of others have been in the position of the Gardai, Irish police, for nearly 4 years and so far no one in Ireland has been jailed for the collapse in 2008.
These recording refer to September 2008 during the Lehmans collapse. At the time Anglo was losing billions in deposits everyday. The whole world knew it was a turkey and were running for cover. The tapes provide an insight into the mentality and strategy of those at the bank who where going cap in hand to the Irish Central bank looking for a cash. I can well imagine similar talk with US banks and the Fed.
Rumors in Ireland began to spread that the banks where in trouble. The gov. increased the state deposit guarantee to 100k euro meaning that all deposits up to 100k euro where save, thus halting a potential bank run.
It didn't work and it didn't calm the markets or the rumors.
On sept. 28th there was a meeting in the dept. of Finance with officials, the taoiseach - Prime Minister, the minister for finance and a plethora of management from irish banks. It was decided to guarantee all deposits and liabilities in all the Irish banks including Anglo. This blanket guarantee was done against the best available advice why? nobody knows
Why doesn't anyone know? because there were no minutes taken at the meeting and we still don't know for sure who was actually there.
The "guarantee" as it has become known in Ireland essentially foot the whole bill of the entire Irish bank collapse on the Irish population, all 3.5 million people in Ireland.
Anglo is the worst bank collapse in the history of economics.
It cost the sate 30 billion euros. The entire "bailout" has so far cost Ireland 67 billion euro.
Contrast this with gov income of around 30 billion per year.
The Irish people have been left to pay the debts of private institutions and will be paying for it for generations to come. Since 2008 300,000 Irish people have once more had to emigrate. Over 450,000 people are unemployed.
But Ireland's "bailout" is working according to all our politicians and yes men.
Many of you reading this are more then likely not Irish and are probably baffled how no one has been held to account. Sadly, as an Irishman i must admit that the Irish people have no backbone and no personal resolve. We lack basic things like accountability. Its actually quite embarrassing reading back on this post to see just how lazy and cynical us Irish people are. We will gladly pass the buck and do the blame game but when it actually comes to accountability the Irish people are no were to be found.
This country will never change and to be honest i couldn't care less. Call me unpatriotic but after whats gone on in this country recently and the litany of scandals since its founding 70 years ago Ive come to realize that Irish people and the Irish Spirit is only present in those who have emigrated. We have even gone so far as to vilify those who left. The Irish gov. in there wisdom once again went cap in hand to the Irish Diaspora particular in the US when they came up with the idea of "the gathering", a tourist initiative, basically asking Irish Americans, in particular to come back to your "home country" but don't forget to bring the greenbacks! A fucking insult to all those who emigrated because Ireland failed them in the past.
The actor Gabriel Byrne who himself had to emigrate has called this what it is, a shakedown.
Listen, alot of Irish people laugh and joke about "Irish Americans" don't be fooled, ye guys are more Irish then we are.
Stay in the US and holiday there. Don't come over here because Irish people need to learn accountability and actually elect people who will serve the state and not vested interests. Only then will i actually be proud of this country. Until then il look to the diaspora for inspiration. You need only look at the long list of famous Irish people who were virtually ran outta there own country and whose memory was then butchered for Irish tourism bullshit.
I reckon il soon join the Irish diaspora and leave this corrupt cesspool also."

Yea I am generating bitcoins also to trade-in on the black-market. I think bitcoin is as valuable as it is now because of the black-market.

Most likely it's banks or the government. They don't like the idea of money they can not control.
@_date: 2013-07-02 00:35:24
This probably explains the value going down recently

Yep that sound about right.
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:31:25
Hmm... I wish there was more info. 
Like, a picture of your facility.
a(n) 'About Us' section. 
Where do you ship? Shipping rates?
Do you accept escrow!? What Buyer/seller protection do you provide?
Things like that. :)

Guy must be a noob.
@_date: 2013-08-03 18:18:23
I bet you its the banks trying to buy up the bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-08-03 21:55:00
yea but paypal would rather listen to their banks then the community, and we all know what the banks think about bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:36:09
Naive!? If a person waiting 40+ weeks when the company is saying every other week 'they will be shipping' then I have every right to be 'Naive.' 
Completely unprofessional. If you're saying a company cant ship 400 orders a day is completely wrong. I have a list of companies that ship way more then 400 a day when they flip the switch.

Hal Finney, you sir have touched my heart.

If you haven't heard lately, Mt. Gox is always in constant DDos attacks and as of late, I've been hearing complaints about unauthorized withdrawals from their site. 
CampBX I think is a more reliable source to exchange your bitcoins. I've been using them for 3 months now and had nothing but positive experiences so far. McAfee also monitors their website 24/7. Never had any downtime
If you're thinking of checking it out use this referral link. it will give your a 10% discount on the exchange rate, which makes it cheaper then Mt. Gox.

This will kick the writers of Forbes.com in the booty &gt;-)

im surprised this isn't in the front page right now
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:45:31
Wow... Big gamble there. Though, the idea of bitcoin bringing back the power of currency back to the people is Enticing. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 21:44:03
Yea man that doesn't sound right. Call back telling them you want to speak to a manager or a high ranking employee there because with all this evidence, they should not come up with this bullshit about seller protection. i'll even threat them with a lawsuit which you can definitely win and sue them to pay off the lawyer and any damages you feel you have taken. Any lawyer will take this case with the evidence you provided. Hope you get to resolve this.

If you paid by credit card, most likely you will get your money back. I think they have a grace period of 6 months or more.
