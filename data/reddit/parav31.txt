What is the tl;dr?
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:22:13
Thank you BOC.
I solved my problem. Not quite as you descbribed but your hint of "watch only address" set me to the right direction.
So this time I did not import my private key (which did nothing).
But I imported my public key --&gt; watch only. So I saw the presence of the BTC in my wallet. But I could not spend because of the lack of private key. But np, I could enter that later when i wanted to send my Bitcoin.

I'm from Belgium.
1. There are only 10.000 clients for this bank.
2. The media did this of as: "fraudulent" top man did it again. This director of the bank has gone bankrupt 3 times before (not specifically in financial sector).
3. The minister of finance did this of as: it was a nice attempt to start a new upcoming bank, but due to this "bad director" it failed.
4. So there is your scapegoat: the bad director. For the rest there is nothing to note. No one cares. Life goes on. The masses are made to believe it's an isolated event, only due to this one guy.
5. The 10.000 clients can sign up here: 
This governmental funds guarantees up to 100.000 euros per person. There is 3.000.000.000 euros ready in this funds. So, for this small bank there won't be a problem covering. Allegedly the bank has enough assets to pay back their customers, without interference of the governmental funds.

You can also google: "china encourages citizens to buy silver"
It's common knowledge China and their people have been hoarding Gold and Silver in the last years.

The fraudulent founder/director I was talking about is Jeroen Piqueur. He is a typical business man, not a media figure. So not famous for the masses, but a name in higher society.There are many Flemish sources to Google. Minister of finance was in De Zevende Dag talkshow yesterday, talking about Optima. This clip can be found on

Same can be said of gold. Lately China has been encouraging its citizens to acquire the metal.

I'm also a HODLER, but I went 3x leverage long. Think about it. I got the same ease of mind, no need to buy/sell. Just wait for it to appreciate, only I appreciate three times more.

Leverage x3 means if Btc goes up 33% i go up 100%. Works in both ways. With a 33% drop from my entry point i get liquidated, no coming back. To do this go to bitmex.com for example. Its margin trading/options. Start small.

The Doubling

Some say the halving is already priced in. Some say "buy the rumour, sell the news". I think this weekend will be important to see what China does.
Also Google registers a lot of search results for "bitcoin + halving". Same happened for "Buy gold" day after BREXIT. And gold went up...
IMO, the price will rise until the halving and then drops just before/after as fuel for the raise runs out. If people think that people think that the fuel has ran out, then the market reacts to that.
