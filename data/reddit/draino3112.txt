On coinbase, you will get the BTC at the price you paid, not when you receive. Rejoice friend.

it means you've received %100 of the bitcoin you purchased.

If your have 4.6 million dollars of bitcoin, the last thing you should be doing is exposing yourself on the internet over a couple hundred bucks in fees.

haha yep, my first amount of bitcoin was from someone in this sub who wanted to get other people started. I received .01 from him. Crazy to think thats a $105 tip right now.

thats my plan! Even if I don't make anything or even lose a little this whole thing is great because as someone who knows very little about economics I'm already understanding things a bit better just from this subreddit alone.

holy hell thank you! Honestly, this just made my day. I'll will pay it forward when I finally buy some of my own!

I get the same thing. Right before I got that I got a "site down notice". I think it's more the sites down then specifically denying you access.

I posted my empty wallet just to tell I was excited and going to jump in the game. Got a $2 tip and I didn't even know that was a possibility. So I see your point but I don't think everyone is phishing for free money...
and I will most certainly pay if forward as soon as I can.

I'm not buying alot. Just wanna "break the seal" already.

So does this mean I should just wait until Thursday or Friday to buy from Coinbase? Whats the benefit of doing it now when nothings going to happen until then?
