I think i need to purchase the file restore program.. I am using easeuse
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:46:56
I think your right - I found another transactions receipt with btc in its name dated in 2010, the other bank summary I saw was currency exchange online purchase .. 
thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:22:30
Has anyone here bought bitcoin back in 2009? and remember getting a e-mail like mine?? I want to make sure this is the right path.. I also remember going on a website copy a pasting the key and adding it to my txt documents.

someone saying  coinme is holding the sale during price dips and jumps - can someone confirm this ?
@_date: 2018-07-23 16:10:50
Thanks but there wasnt any wallet involved.. it was a offline paper wallet - thats the only thing i am sure of.. and why I'm trying to  correlated to the encrypted file possibilities.. I did this purchase when i was Iraq and it wasn't even possible to download the wallet with my available bandwidth.    before i was trying to search a pattern string for the typical address lengthen of a bitcoin address... like using "P2PKH which begin with the number 1, 
P2SH type starting with the number 3, eg: or Bech32 type starting with bc1.... but couldnt figure out the command to do this.. "but if the information is still in a encrypted document.. i dont think it will be possible to find it ?

having problems with bitcoins not showing up in the block chain.. nothing... ugh 
@_date: 2018-04-19 00:49:07
yeah I open the file into the note pad already and tried to upload them into the wallets and its still showing un-recognized.. so I was thinking maybe I have to uncrypt it to get the btc info.
 
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:38:24
come on man.. way to passive.. how am I supposed to feed off that?
@_date: 2019-05-23 15:14:15
took me about 2 years to convince my parents to invest in btc... I was getting a cold shoulder from them and they were accusing me I was going to get them in trouble with the law..  yep you can blame your fake news outlet fb and other social media entities.
