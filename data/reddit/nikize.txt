Even if I agree with you on the other client part, it would make no difference (which I hope you already know, if not you will learn something new now) since 8333 is the default listening port for the bitcoin protocol and all clients will if not listen, at least try to connect to port 8333 unless they also get information about connecting to a different port.

In practice a small-ish increase that we would need right now is a non issue,
* blockchain size is not an issue - new drives costs almost nothing, and pruning is available for those that actually can't afford it.
* transfer of blocks is not an issue - all nodes already receives all transactions, which for a while have been lots more then 1MB/10min, so with thin blocks this isn't an issue since receiving a new block only means that you get the additional 80 byte header and then reconstructs the block locally from mempool (which would be smaller if there wasn't a backlog).
* validation time - the time it takes to validate a block for each node, this is not a bigger issue with bigger blocks then it is now, the same rules as before can still apply, since it never happens that the ops limit is reached in current blocks anyway.
* mempool - it overflows right now, and actually is an issue _because_ blocks are small.
* I have also seen mentions about unspent transactions (UTXO) being and issue - with current state it even is impossible to spend many of the transactions that could otherwise be possible to consolidate.
Satoshi also specifically wrote, that in the end everyone won't be running full validating nodes, this would be done by companies that really care. But still if you want, you will be able to run a full node even with gigabyte blocks - but maybe not at home if you live in a area where all ISPs sucks. But even if the protocol would allow this today, there will still be several years before it would be even possible to have such large blocks (Since there is not enough transactions) so by that time at least those ISPs would have to have upgraded their shit at least a bit to be able to stream the 4K and 8K video that is just around the corner.

When I use a normal bank the transaction fee is 0, as in zero. I know that the US still only has checking accounts and transferring money is expensive for you and takes several days. In other parts of the world the fee (as I wrote) is zero, and transactions is instant, or at most takes to the next banking day.

Each time I read their (and your) decision of lack of scalability action it makes me really angry. Instead of destroying bitcoin with things like the resonable secure way zero-conf works by implementing RBF and making sure it is insecure. There should be work done on bigger blocks and fixing consensus on it. And no LN will never be an acceptable "solution" *argh*

Thanks for explaining it for those who don't know how hash functions work.
If a shortcut (yes backdoor was poor wording) is found that makes it possible to calculate the nonce with just a few steps, instead of testing, that more or less is zero PoW in that case the difficulty bits might just not be enough and still be valid. (it is hard to prove or disprove how many zeros is possible in the hash?)

When did the definition of majority change? Seems like BIP66 is being activated by miners vote, how come that is ok but not BIP101?
@_date: 2015-12-07 01:24:25
A few pointers: Quantum computing is the possible vulnerability, sure if SHA256 is somehow broken Proof of work will need to change, and if ECDSA is broken then address reuse won't be safe. (that's why it should be avoided already)
If there was any known vulnerability, it should have been used to attack the network already.

blocksize is only a very small part of that function, blocksize limit even less so. Let me instead ask: if there was 10gb blocks tomorrow, how many users and nodes is it likely there are? (as well as network upgrades to handle this)
If the blocksize limit was removed on every node today, would that result in much bigger blocks? of course not since the risk of orphaning still gets higher due to the physical network capability. Which is something the miners won't be willing to risk due to the high difficulty.

Wasn't it you that wrote that above, that mining should not "hold the privilege of defining what is Bitcoin" but now you are saying it should.

* Short term BIP101, then "thin blocks"
* IPv6 Multicast.
* Block check scoring (broadcast that you received a block, and allow transmission of unchecked block, and instead score based on how many other nodes say it have validated the block, this will allow checking blocks in parallel to sending. also "blocktorrent" will help)
* client should support "SPV mode" while downloading the full chain.
* wallet on pruned chain

FYI BIP101 uses the same consensus algo UNTIL 750/1000 last blocks (that is 75% majority) + 14 days. And even then some brave miner needs to mine a block that exceeds 1 000 000 Bytes, Only then does an for occur. but until then the consensus algorithm will stay the same :D

Only the longest chain will be active, that means the 1mb+ chain needs to be sustained by 50%+ of the miners, and in that case it will be quite valid. Also as long as there have not been enough blocks on the 1mb+ for the coinbase to mature, any transactions that was in the 1mb+ block is most likely also in the corresponding &lt;1mb block.
So succeeding with defrauding anyone in this manner is possible - but very very unlikely!

Now if we could get all customers to use Bitcoin instead that is ofcourse better!
@_date: 2015-12-08 06:27:04
Until someone mines a block that parts of the network rejects since some miners suddenly are using new rules. Soft forks is said to be more "safe" just because full nodes does not reject them, but consensus is still needed to not cause forking issues.
Soft forks are _only_ decided on by miners, while hard forks needs support for the whole network, in that sense hard forks are better because everyone (and not just miners) can vote by supporting the change or not.

I agree, it's "just" a max block-size cap. Let's say a few days after this is live (and just play with the idea of everyone accepts to forward these blocks) and then someone does create a max-sized block, how long will it take for that to propagate, and what kind of head-start will that give to the lucky miner?
We need bigger blocks, we need it kind of now, but using something that will eat more bandwidth then what most have will risk causing to much centralization. Slow growth that at-least "kind of" follows average bandwidth.
In conclusion: Going to 20MB blocks now is an unnecessary risk. (to the network) Also the trust of scalability of Bitcoin will not exist until there is at-least an Dynamic baseline for the max size.

We need forks and other clients (not of the blockchain! just clients), as it is now most users are running the same software - bitcoin core, and most of them just blindly update when there is a new release and just accepts all changes. That is good for quick deployment of new features, but it can also be very bad for stability.
Just like Internet Explorer once was the most used browser and now the market is diversified (with a few taking the top) the same thing is needed with bitcoin, There needs to be multiple fullnode alternatives to core and, and I'm looking forward to the day when all big miners/mining pools are more or less running their own version.
An alternative to this is to actually be able to configure which parts you want your client to support. Do you want getnodes support on both incoming and outgoing connections, how many connections do you want to allow, which is the minimal fees you want to rebroadcast, which blocksize are you prepared to forward and support etc. all this could be changed without major issues on an non mining full node.

I'd say that the hard 1MB limit is an bug that needs fixing, just like any other bug that have forced forks.
Why? because the promise of bitcoin was and is "an international currency that will take over the world" more or less. And to do so it must handle many more tps, I think this one of the biggest hurdles that prevents global adoption. Once we have bigger blocks, the growth of bitcoin usage will explode!

How can something that takes "zero" work to get, be used as Proof of work?
That is assuming any kind of backdoor is found in SHA256, On the other hand if you consider rainbow tables (as in the case of MD5) as broken then sure, however 80byte rainbowtables is unlikely. And in that case it can already be done today?
MD5 was found insecure just because it can be pre premutated, if similar is found for SHA256 it could be used as PoW but very inefficient, and if that happens bitcoin will be migrated to an "altcoin" with a different PoW algorithm.

Any source on most uses 3rd party?
Regardless if most merchants (will only talk about physical here) use a 3rd party payment processor or not, the same thing will happen in the end.
Since if the merchant takes the risk, and get double spends then they will most likely drop it due to "to high risk/to big loss".
And if you go with 3rd party you will end up with an higher percentage fee than with plastic due to the same reason and thus drop it.
Making it easier to double spend will limit adoption, not promote adoption.

It's not an "altcoin" before super majority is reached. And even then it would have the biggest consensus. So is it really an alt, or is it just that there is then some clients that lags behind (willingly or unwillingly) in upgrading to consensus.
This is the same thing as with  just a difference in how critical.
@_date: 2015-06-29 18:57:06
Compile from sources yourself and pick which changes you want.
Does any of the big miners actually use binaries and not compiling themselves? Binary patches - no please don't even try!
Since it is a change in the consensus code you can't even do plugins so 2 different clients is needed, one for BIP 101 and one without.
Even if it is only one person that is in control of the XT repo, you can, and should compare the sources to core before using it. But on the other hand do you check the changes made to core before you upgrade?

Old coins will still be transferred and mined by both chains.
Only newely created coins on any of the chains will be limited to that chain (and old coins mixed with new ones)
It is only when old and "new" coins is mixed in a transaction that you double the old coins. (however when this starts to happen, the value of bitcoin will probably go down to compensate for possible double coins)

We will get 2 blockchains, but transactions with only old coins will be mined by both chains.
1. so any transactions will be mined by both chains and you will not lose any coins.
2. Coins generated on and after the split is only valid on that chain.
3. if transactions contains inputs with coins generated after the split, that transaction will only be forwarded and 
mined by one of the forks. (and not both as in 1 above)
In this last case you might be able to double your old coins to both chains.
If you succeed in spending to each chain you have doubled your coins, but if this happens, most likely the market value of bitcoin will instead be halved. and so you end up with the same "value" anyway.
My guess is that noone will accept payment with transactions containing any coins created after the split, atleast not until there is a quite a big overtake in one or the other. We should probably assume that the first couple of big blocks will be orphaned.
Only coins created by the chain that "fails" and transactions containing those coins will be "lost" by the recipient. (and lost in this case refers to useless and/or "of no value")

But it is totally fine to merge changes into "core" that not all users agree with? - There have been several changes that many users would not agree with if they actually read the changelog.
We need more full node clients be it forks of core or rewritten from scratch. The centralization of most nodes being from the same "publisher" is way worse then have XTs "mined block version votes" for bigger block size. It's even possible to merge that code into core if you don't agree with the other changes in XT.

The decrease in number of nodes can be explained by introduction of SPV wallets.
By creating more use-cases and thus driving adoption and more users, it can also be the opposite and reach more users that want to help out (for free) and run full nodes. The goal here should be more nodes run by and controlled by different people or companies, even if many of them would run from big companies.
For example, let's say every company (or just half of them) that receives bitcoin runs their own full node(s) would it then matter if banks or google runs a few hundred or even thousand? But for this to happen more companys will need to receive and then spend their coins, and not use third parties to convert what they received to fiat.

[long answer in other reply](
What happens if the network starts sending 20MB blocks tomorrow?, what will the propagation times be? How many do have the bandwidth to handle that flow? How many orphan blocks will we get, and how long chains of blocks will the first lucky miner get due to head-start (slow propagation)
Is it really worth the risk to go for 20MB in one swell swoop?
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:40:45
Yes and if I was a miner with big hash power I would create a block as big as possible - since the network is slow I can get a head start on the next block, yes it might be risky but if I succeed with that as well the big downhill spiral have started. Blocksize needs to have some kind of limitation to prevent an "centralization attack", the best would be to have the limit grow together with average bandwidth for nodes. But I would take anything that is expected to give an similar growth pattern.

So instead of having different bugs that can be detected by testing against different implementations, you are saying that it would be good idea to have one (possible buggy) lib instead.
And that lib is usable in Python, PHP, .NET, Java or whatever?
Having a reusable lib is a good. But "different implementations of the consensus" is not an good argument, But having a library that you can test your own implementation against however is.
@_date: 2015-12-08 07:11:20
BIP101 enabled clients use the same blockchain, you are confused what activation of consensus rule change mean.
The last (major) fork happened because? Right, a change in rules because of a soft fork getting majority and activating a change, that not all miners followed, and others didn't bother to check before building on top - in that case miners continued on top of that chain for a while, and than that chain was orphaned. (lets hope you are with me so far) So as long as clients use the longest chain there will be no alt. unless the software is outdated. If you don't agree with that then there is (shortlived) altcoins happening all the time where blocks are orphaned.
@_date: 2015-06-28 19:16:24
Well when they do update many does so without caring about which changes, and many times I have wanted some, but not all of the updates, so far I have not gone in to cherry picking, and just updated anyway. (You and I have had the "Gentoo disucssion" before, let's not go there again)
Some rules could be ignored and everything would work just fine.. For example running an full node that allows 20MB blocks, no problem at all, However If you use it for mining it won't get far. In that sense consensus rules could be ignored or enforced further, and thus be different between clients, however a client used for mining need to be more careful about what it generates - as long as it cares for getting generated blocks propagated.

Get a reality check!
Yes anyone can STEAL coffee, now why don't they?
* Cash: they have gotten the money - it could be fake but they can probably give it to someone else anyway.
* Credit and debit card: Banks ensures that you have a reasonable way of getting money, and they do most of the time.
* With bitcoin and RBF there will be lots stealing coffee just because it is easy, and because of that merchants will stop taking bitcoin themselves, with any luck they will move to 3rd parties that guarantee payment, but that will come with an higher cost to cover all the fraud.
I'm talking about this from a merchants perspective, with RBF and where bitcoin is going would no longer take bitcoin without multiple confirimations. Bitcoin is simply killing itself.

Sorry, won't be sifting thru the Changelogs to find it right now - so I guess you will get a win on that point, for now.

Where was there any excuse? Just stating the facts, since it is real facts and the chargebacks do happen. (working in a store and seen it multiple times that we have to send prof of purchase to the bank.)
Sorry but you are making no sense at all.
Waiting for the "fool proof" security of the recommended 6 confirmations will never be acceptable in a store. (note it is not fool prof - just very secure!)
So take the risk "yourself" as a merchant, or have somone else take the risk for a fee, example of this is BitPay and others.

So when the value of a currency changes, the decimal point should be moved?
Let's see so 10 Current $ Should be called 1 New $
And 1 Current Yen Should be 10 New Yen
All this bits naming and what not in one way or another is a just a terrible idea! Stop it!

With demand the prices rises, and thus the market becomes bigger.

If you pay with credit card, do you stay in the store for 6 months so that the transaction can not be reversed? (yes that is the time of possible cancelation of a credit charge)
Most of the time the risk is small enough, and when it is not you can have a "insurance company" take a percentage of all transactions in fee, but they will ensure you get all transactions.

If we are talking about you meet someone on town for a quick exchange, you can still make the same checks for double spends and the risk is minimal, ofcourse if it is a car maybe you will probably have to stay over coffe for ~6 transactions.

There is fake bills as well, which is one problem that bitcoin solves - so all payment methods have their own problems.
And if you compare a fake bill with a double spend, the double spend will be detected, while the fake bill might not, and you will also have a timestamp and a exact purchase, and hopefully the fraud can be tied to security footage. This is even faster then detection of credit card fraud, that in the best of cases takes ~24h.

It is true that some choose to use a 3rd party service. But no one is forced to use any of them to partake in the Bitcoin system. And even if they are on one end of the transaction they are not needed for the other end.

It is impossible in a decentralized system.
If you go centralized you have multiple options since everything is handled by a "trusted" entity.
But none of the existing "day to day" payment methods have a sefe "now" transfer. so What are we comparing to?
Some examples:
* Cash: Good, but it might be a counterfeit, that is denied by the bank.
* CreditCard: You dont get the money until the day after at the erliest, and then you have the possiblity of fraud that may cause the bank to take the money back even months later.
* Bank transfer - not used in day to day purcase - but can be instant.
Compared (yes we must compare to something!) with Bitcoin, you will be safe after 1 confirmation, and super safe after 6 confirmations.

Since 6 confirmations is still fasten then 6 months, and the risks is well the same. And since CC is the most used payment method today - it is the place where Bitcoin can take the most "market-share"
The physical instore transactions will have to be Zero-Confirmation - and will risk Doublespending etc - but you will know for sure if it was a fraud or not normally within the hour - and can contact authorities and still have a chance to catch the "thief". Will most higher value transactions will be over the internet, where a 6 confirmation wait - most of the time will not be an issue.
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:19:49
I agree,
But as a PoS developer I would implement like this:
Most vendors (merchants) will not wait for a confirmation.
I would split merchants into 2 categories.
* Physical sale locations, where you do not force the customer to wait for confirmation before saying it is paid. instead you watch for double spends for a few seconds. (small risk since physical presence)
* Shipping or non Physical presence, where you mark transaction as probably safe after not seeing double spends for a few seconds, then at least one confirmation before accepting, or at least 6 confirmations if it is a big purchase.
And of course for a merchant each transaction is done to a unique address.

Debit/Credit cards costs from 0%-2% of the total transaction, that adds up to quite a loot in year for a merchant(business) if that can be avoided - which it will if Bitcoin gains global recognition. Then the cost of card transactions can instead be used to lower the cost of products. It will not replace all Card transactions, but say that 50% is moved to crypto, that's 0.5-1% in reduced prices.
On smaller transactions, say in the 1-3$ range the static card fee for every transaction of ~0.3$ end up being 10% of the purchase.
Transaction wise, Bitcoin is not free, but it is cheaper. (And then there is speed in which the funds are actually transferred.)

Your reply suggest I was talking about web, when it was all about physical presence.
I say the check for double spends is 1-5 secs. add a few secs for scanning QR code and pressing send on phone, so ok that's about 8 secs on a unlucky day.
In the rare case of a double spend you call security, and let they handle the purchase as possible fraud. If you have signs with information "double spend = fraud" and it's consequences, the probability of anyone trying double spends at all will be minimal.

Github is unaffected, and most git repos for BTC related sw is hosted there.
The issue is .git/config in the git repo, by adding Config (note big C) this will overwrite the original config in case insensitive filesystems (such as windows and MacOS) and in that way create a security flaw. - but that will need access to the repo and then the original config might have the same flaws.

Let's compare this with Debit/Credit Cards that have a possible charge back time of 6 months(!)
In Scandinavia the merchant will have to pay for any charge backs if the customer did not Pay with EMV (Using chip) and Pin.
If just signature signed for example and the customer says they didn't make the purchase then the Merchant will lose the money.
In the case where EMV and Pin was used the Merchants bank will instead take the loss.
Now how does a Merchant avoid risk? And why is 10 Minutes average max confirmation time a non issue?
* The Merchant listens for the transaction on the network, make sure it is seen by multiple nodes on the network before allowing a 0 confirmation transaction.
* The Merchant listens for any double spends for the same inputs in the same manner.
* You also make sure that the transaction contains a recommended fee.
The above is normally done securely within 10 seconds. This is enough with customer physically present.
Note the "listen on network" above. If you instead get the "sent" transaction from the customers wallet by NFC or BT, then it might actually not be on the network, and it is slightly more possible to get a double spend in place.
Of course every payment is done to individual addresses for each purchase, so you check this unique address for the expected amount.
If the Merchant wants more security they can always use a 3rd party that takes the risk, but that will come for a fee. In the same way as banks take a fee from the Merchant when a purchase is done with a debit/credit card.
**TL;DR 10 minutes is mostly a non issue for merchants**

Do you run a service that works even if the website is not available?
a site and a service is different things, and that's why the change would be complex - since it is different things, let my try to explain...
SatoshiDice (as an example) run all their logic on bitcoin node(s) that have no (or minimal) interraction with the site itself. Even if the site is down you can still "play the game".
(The display on the website is most likely data from other bitcoin instances, and a one way datatransfer of older data once every 24h)
Now if they would give specific addresses for every play, they would need to track which of the different types of game each address belongs to, this database would just grow humongous in notime.
And add to this that they open up the possibility of security issues in allowing the website to communicate with the wallet.
And you also have the "problem" of getting addresses that starts 1dice - now I would love to see the one-liner for returning a new 1dice address in a timely manner.
So no, it is far from a "one changed line in their codebase".

The blockchain is a very good no-trust proof-of-ownership system, as long as it is created within this system.
But it is not possible to use as a proof-of-id since there is no no-trust way to transfer the ID without a authority that is allowed to identify and generate the digital token.
PGP is in that case a better example of ID, but it depends on others identifying that you are you.

And a Creditcard transaction can be reverted up to 6 months after the transaction. (one local PSP FAQ even says 24 months) Sure you can get a name of the customer and take legal action in that case but that would probably cost more (just in time) then the original purchase?
It will also be likely that we see companies, like BitPay, that takes the risk of a invalid payment for a part of the transaction.
You yourself mention how to check for valid transactions, and double spend in the comments so that is a good solutions, and in the case of possible non valid transactions, just be informative, have a sign with the policy as you stated, "tx inputs must be confirmed, all attempts at double spending will be sent to the police as a case of fraud. In case of issues we might have to wait for up to 6 transactions" and this will be a small issue if at all. (just as the rare issues with a creditcard not working because of bank or PSP problems)

It's about the same time as it took a few years ago, CPU speed and code optimization have made it faster, try to sync with a few year old client and it would probably take at least x3 in time. Also most of the validation is single core only, so newer machines with multiple cores is not much faster then the older ones. One this truly becomes a problem then code can be developed to mitigate this issue one example is header only validation as a first step and with multiple branches, and then transaction validation in separate threads. Another thing to do is to make a "node usable" sync first and full sync in the background but still keeping the client usable.

Never said that files can't be altered. (where did you get that from?)
Data can be altered - but if any block is altered - it is no longer valid and will not be accepted by any other node. So in practice only data since the last block would be an issue (but that would be resolved by sending those transactions again which the clients does)
The blockchain is an archive database and it does not destroy files. Clients implementing a backend for the blockchain might use files, and it might have a bug that could destroy those files. but there is still a multitude of clients out there, and some of them might even be writing to "read-only/write-once" medium.

an 3rd party database is not allowed,
Even if they by themselves are not bound to be PCI compliant.
Anyone connecting to such a service would lose it's PCI compliance.
In the agreement between the cardholder and the issuer it says more or less that you violate the agreement if you give the card data to anyone that is not PCI compliant.
But even if you solve that issue somehow (ex just store the 123456******1234 + valid thru part) It will still be a long upphill struggle.

We agree on: To handle card transactions you must be PCI certified and this is checked once per year.
To save/generate "the database" is not PCI compliant in any way.
For a PCI certified entetiy to work with a clearly non PCI compliant entity - would not be PCI comliant.
Also saving/caching the database is still a way of saving card data that is not needed to process the card transaction. And that is also not compliant.
No gateway would be willing to take the risk.
But wouldn't the real problem be in getting all or at-least most gateways to support this. And in my part of the world the biggest gateways are mostly owned by the banks that will not want to touch bitcoin. So it is a no go anyway?

You install minimal set of apps you need, (preferably from trusted sources, such as your OS package system, portage in the case of Gentoo), you use firewall, check that nothing is listening, or even communicating that should not be there. And of course all applications are running as unprivileged user(s).
And you do not initialize any untrusted connections.
Now you wait and only install updates to fix security vulnerabilities and nothing else.

No, current nodes will accept, and relay transactions using segwit, as soon as they are accepted they are relayed.
About blocks, what I mean is have the node accept, but not rebroadcast new blocks that contains transactions with segwit. How would the change of local rules for broadcasting blocks need a fork? If I decide to change my node to not do any rebroadcasting at all, does that require a fork? (you should know damn well that it does not)

You could still create a wallet.dat containing any data you want and still have a valid signature.
Only solution would be for the client to always check one or more transactions against the blockchain. And rescan the whole index if an inconsistancy is found. So this is only an issue of how it is cached in the client. There is no issue with the protocol, or any blockchain!
But then again you can still change the client. And if you have access and can swap wallet.dat or can trick someone in to changing it, you could as well install a modified client.


Would it? Since you are making a "targeted" attack you can very easy make sure it does not happen, and even without any effort it still would be problem until it's "to late" for the victim. (it is not hard to sign a executable! And this will only happen on a Windows machine)

Distributed means that work can be done on multiple locations/machines. It is not implicit that it will still work if any machine goes down. But I have so far not seen a distributed system that depends on all machines to be working on all times.
Decentralized means that there is no one location/machine that is needed for it to work.
Lets take one of the biggest datacenters companys as an example: Google. They are centralized since they depend on some nodes (ex the domainname) but their computing power is distributed, and any machine could go down but it does still work.

Take a look at an exchanges order book. Each order is someone that is willing to buy or sell for that price, When there is two that meets then you have a transaction at an agreed price.
a Buy/Sell will always come from an "agreement" of price (regardless of product) this gives it value, if none wants a product you as a seller can lower the price to get a trade. And if there is multiple that wants to buy then you can make the price higher. This is supply and demand.

Except for all the core clients due to refusal of raised blocksize...
Getting a 32MB limit right now would not change much otherwise, some nodes will leave in pure protest, but if we ignore that and just look on the pure size raise there will be some that leaves as times goes on... When we reach 32MB you will need a good enough to handle 32MB*8 every 10 Minutes (avg) The bigger issue might be RAM and CPU usage to handle that. So Maybe half of _current_ nodes would leave - but to actually have that size of blocks the usage will be now * 32 - which minimum would give us ~ current node count * 4 - So in practice an increase in nodecount!

Calculation for 8MB/10 Minutes was indeed for one connection that's why I mentioned 2Mbit/s minimum since it would result in ~1Mbit with 8 connections.
It was in response to the "from _ever_ catching up at 8MB" argument, since that only requires one connection, and it would still be possible to "catch up" with 32MB blocks and in that "catch up" case upload is irrellevant and that's why I used the wording "enough to _follow_ the chain" It is not necessary for the client to broadcast everything to all connections and just be in listen only mode. So the argument "mining attack blocks that would stop people from ever catching up at 8MB" does not hold! Also remember that if a "mining attack" would actually be beneficial to miners we would have seen that long before now.

Or maybe they where just running nodes that is not public aka not reachable from the outside - I don't even think any miner has their main node available from the outside, instead they only have outgoing connections and possible a public proxy node - effectively mining nodes can't be attacked in the same manner since there is nothing that is available to connect to.

Most transactions would already have been seen, so there won't be any need to check those same transactions again when they arrive in the block. If a miner would try to use this as an attack it would just work against them since it would risk slowing down propagation.

I'd say that putting any "secret" in the address bar, regardless of intent, could and probably should be considered insecure.
Just take the unfortunate events where screens where captured by TV-Crew and brodcast by national TV by BBC, if that would have been an rushwallet page instead of password in the corner... well (hopefully) you get the point.
You can ignore the "secret in addressbar" issue and put all the blame on the users, or you could try to change the behavior.
Suggestion, put an input where the secret part is written, set visibility:hidden and only set visibility:visible in the parents element :hover (take that as psuedo CSS in case it has any misstake)

EB1/AD9999999 is a clear stance we will never change
EB1/AD6 means we will accept bigger blocks when the network is ready
So for now, no one is voting for bigger blocks, but rather it is a vote to get the network ready for voting for bigger blocks. Once it has gone past that first voting, they can start voting for actually accepting bigger blocks, and once that is done the final part for actuall bigger blocks can be done - so the risk management have all been moved to miners and nodes, rather then being dependant on a development team.

So you are saying that your connection can't handle a download speed of 8MB/10Minutes? That is an average of 13.66KB/s or ~110Kbit/s I hope most people have 2Mbit/s at minimum, and if they are trying to run a full node a 24Mbit ADSL connection will be more then enough to follow the chain even at 32MB blocks (but it will take some years before the blocks becomes that size even if the max would be set to that today)

If SW is a blocksize increase that means it will send bigger blocks to old clients, and also that a SW client will accept &gt;1MB blocks in the old format. If any of this is false then that means that the definition of block has changed, and in reality the block size have not increased at all.

Ok, let's first check the definition here... 


Normal connections don't have any artificial limits... My 40Mbit/s down - 10Mbit/s up VDSL+ connection currently gives me 39.35 Mbit/s down and 9.86 Mbit/s up.
There is no data cap on this connection that matches the definition above. In theory in a 30 day month this gives me an actual "cap" of ~15.5 TiB of data (in both directions)
If this connection would be "limited" in any way by the ISP due to high usage they will have to prove that the usage is not normal, otherwise they will be liable for damages, of course they could always cancel the contract, but they must do so with 3 months notice.
And for completeness: This is a standard home connection which I pay ~74USD per month ... there is fiber connections with 100/100 (or even more) - still no artificial limit, and that costs even less.
Sure I have mobile LTE/4G connections as well with a data cap of only 10GiB per month which costs me ~30USD/month but I would not call that a "normal" connection.

Only one consensus rule will be changed (the max block size) - something that anyone can change on their own node without any effect on the network, it's not until a miner creates a block bigger then 1000*1000 B that there will be an actual fork, since "old" clients won't accept them. And as usual everyone is allowed to vote with their mining power. (or lack thereof)
We are currently using the 3rd version of an Bitcoin alt - just that there have not been any real opposition to any of the earlier ones.
@_date: 2015-08-11 21:04:01
That is the same as the other forks that we have had - even if it was with the intention that everyone agreed on, there where forks!
Until the BIP 101 code is merged the XT client can't be an alt. And after that it will still not be an alt until the majority of the miners have voted for it so that the new rules is activated. (and even if the rules are activated an block bigger then 1mb needs to be mined)
If you want to ban discussions at that time about the forkcoin - then fine. 
But until then you are censoring talk about an non Core Bitcoin Client, that could cause an fork - but isn't an alt. And your actions make me think about North Korea!
So aren't you violating your own rules?

Nice point! indeed the blocksize limit should not be an consensus rule - it should be removed from the consensus part and moved to more network related parts and might be "don't accept blocks bigger then x, unless there is newer blocks that depends on it" then anyone could change the max size they mine, noone might accept that block at first but might accept it if anyone builds on top of that - there is some issues with that - but I think it is an interesting idea.

Sounds awesome to rebuild the US and international fee model of banking, on top of the blockchain.
I'm living in evolved part of the world where I only pay an minimal yearly fee for my internet banking and other then that have 0 fees (yes ZERO fees) when transferring within the country, and even within SEPA.
Also there is this thing called "Realtime payments" (more known as Swish) that has instant delivery, uses cellphone numbers instead of account numbers - and once again have zero fees!!!
Do you really think that an more expensive alternative will be an hit. Sure an small fee to have "quick" confirmation on an decentralized network - but any more then the 0.0001 BTC and you can forget Bitcoin in any form for everything except possibly International transfers. But if it comes to that the value of BTC will be so low that it will be useless anyway.

An change to the consensus rules in a responsible manner (by voting, as so many times before) - even without consensus from all developers, can still be Bitcoin - and especially in this case it is, since it fixes an long standing limitation.
And voting from miners is the right thin since it is miners that will have the biggest impact in the sense of initial data transmissions, and increased risk of orphaned blocks.
But something that is clearly wrong, always have been, and always will be - is censorship - and that is what you are taking part in right now.

When you send coins from an address - you need to sign it with your private key and as such make your public key public, that's why you should not reuse addresses. But there is still no known attack vectors, just an extra step to minimize risk if it becomes an issue in the future.
And if someone knows that an address belongs to you, they might be able to trace how you spend it. At least how much, but it is harder to know to who.

Was looking for linux kernel configurations but got lazy, atleast proof of existing, implemented, and used NAT: 
The reason we have wide spread IPv4 NAT usage is that it's hard to get public ipv4-addresses, especially thru some ISPs, and then there is routing needed if you want to have your own managed network. And that's not even talking about the impossibilities of actually giving each device an public IPv4 address since there just isn't enough.
With IPv6 anyone can get their own subnet - but you still need to get it routed and that might not be so easy - and even if your ISP should give you unlimited dynamic public IPv6 addresses. You might still want to have your own managed network. So at some point when IPv4 is dead and you have stopped using it internally you might still be having a IPv6 NAT router since you where unable to get a route into your internal, but maybe still public IPv6 addresses.

As far as privacy goes with DHCPv6 it's the same as DHCPv4
An home network and small routers will likely use rad with possible privacy issues. Hopefully they will just be replaced with switches instead.
An ISP or bigger companys/universites/schools etc will have multiple routers, no rad, and central DHCP management - in this case it will (or atleast can) be just like ipv4 where you get an number in the range. The address is up to the DHCP server and nothing else.

Which spam attack?
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:04:00
Sometimes you might want to include an fee to make sure the transaction gets processed in the next block (this is quite common right now because of spam attacks) another reason is complex transactions (high bytes/btc count) is rejected by the network.
In the future, when the block reward is lower, we should expect to see miners start ignoring transactions with low or zero fees. but the goal is still to have low fees, and that miners should get enough incentive just by the shear quantity of transactions with low fees. (at least according to Nakamotos whitepaper)

Actually just "common sense" from an network management perspective, and trying to put up an IPv6 network, rad/SLAAC can be used to quickly auto configure closest router, however you want more then that, DNS servers, hostname and domain, maybe also ntp server, you may also want network booting (PXE) that needs tftp server and filename. ISPs normally have DHCP relay and one central point (with redundancy) for the DHCP so it is all easily managed - I would be surprised to see any ISP that deploys IPv6 and does not use DHCPv6.
You might actually use both SLAAC and DHCP and then it depends more on the OS which address will be used for outgoing traffic. (it will have both addresses to choose from)

An input can only be included in a block once. (otherwise the block is invalid).
That page only lists transactions (they might not be in a block) with inputs that exists in more then one transaction and that any of blockchain.infos nodes have seen.
Only one of the transactions for an input will eventually be included in a block. or atleast different chains - but in the end - only one of them will be valid.

But I believe it was clarified at the end with " or atleast different chains"
@_date: 2015-07-22 21:31:10


Did I just read that!? So not handling fee increases for users now is dangerous?
Ok, fine I can agree with that, it is an golden opportunity to implement "estimated time to inclusion into block" for transactions and give the users ability to change fees accordingly.
There will be plenty of time to do that before an super majority of a new blocksize kicks in anyway.
But "kicking the can down the road" when it comes to upping the blocksize is even more dangerous!
When we have clients that can adopt the fee depending on the queue,
and there is a constant need for transactions that goes thru within 2 hours or less, 
and those transactions are more then the current blocksize can handle.
and the transaction rate for above transactions never goes below the blocksize limit.
What will happen? I'd say skyrocketing fees when the fees are outbidding each other. This is when bitcoin collapses.
But what is the limit? Will it be ok to pay 0.1 or even 0.01 BTC in fees to get a transaction thru within the before mentioned 2 hours?
It might sound unrealistic that this will happen, but is it impossible to see this in a year or two? And how long will it actually take for a blocksize change to be implemented, activated, and being stable on the network? a year is extremely optimistic i'd say!

As I understand it the "censoring" is because of XT being an alt - which it is not - first of all the blocksize change (BIP 101) is not yet merged, and the second is that it won't be an alt before majority of the blocks is merged with that block version - and even if that happens, I like the explanation that it's not an altcoin, and rather an forkcoin - so what are the rules that are broken when posting about it exactly?

@_date: 2015-08-17 22:11:59
I understand, but don't see any real problem longest chain is what should be used, if BIP 101 get 75% then that should be the new main chain, if it only gets 50(real)% or less then it will simply switch back to the longest chain - as long as XT does not add an checkpoint it should be fine - But it should probably have the additional check of not only 75%+2weeks instead also have and sustained 75% or more.

I don't trust Satoshi - I simply don't trust anyone - but I do trust the bitcoin consensus code. Many of the current core devs have even proven themselfs to have their own agenda and not looking out for the real bitcoin users.

With SPV mining the size should not matter to the lag - and when it is time to actually build big blocks, lets say that it will be noticable for China at 1.5M then we hopefully already have gotten differential distribution of blocks. (that is the block is not transmitted, only information about the block and then the block is rebuilt locally based on already received transactions, Gavin made an explanation about it)
So my "the lag is minimal if at all" was ment to mean if SPV mining is used, or the blocksize have not gone up (it wont jump to 8mb at once) or that we have gotten the diff distribution of blocks in place.
Sorry for not explaining it properly in my first response.
Edit: Found the link about block distribution with bloom filters:

Since you agree with that point, you should understand why I don't agree with ...


And also your statement about security implications - when there in actuality might be none.
Can you point me to an orphaned blockchain branch created with the _intent_ of using consensus issues to claim that a confirm is valid. Or maybe rather what would be a possible scenario where it would be more profitable to use this attack vector, rather then spending the mining power on gaining spendable coinbases?
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:40:10
750 / 1000 not 2000 then there is 2 weeks before it is allowed to mine &gt;1mb blocks, and then there actually needs to be a block that is  bigger then 1mb for an fork to happen. 
And more likely the less supported chain will quickly die, but even if it don't most transactions will probably appear in both chains. (as long as they don't have competing coinbases)

You have delay in each transistor - and there is many transistors! it's way slower then then speed of light. and to that add that most nw switches is store and forward, that is it collects the full packet (normally 1500 bytes max) checks the contents, and then sends it out - so you get an 1500 * 8 bit delay in each device.
By that logic I'd say that your statements are false - but please provide an source to prove me wrong.
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:23:08
True they did - by mistake because of a bug, so it does not make the fee ok. How much of your own coins (not stolen, and no bugs) would you be willing to pay to get a transaction thru within 2 hours?
@_date: 2015-07-17 21:33:31
Let me turn the question...
Do you know who designed and created the CPU of the device you are currently using?
Do you know if he or she have any bad intentions, and even if someone says there is no bad intentions how could you trust them?
The same holds true for so much else, like banks, or maybe not, because we know they have bad intentions and we still use them, don't we?
The question "how do you cope with .." is in this sense wrong, we don't cope, we simply don't care!
The logic behind the protocol holds, none have so far been able to disprove any of the consensus parts. The code for the original Bitcoin is open, and there is other implementations as well.
Even if there is any bad intentions (like discrediting banks) I probably agree with those intentions, but even if I don't agree on everything, it's not anything dealbreaking!
@_date: 2015-07-22 08:38:41
Without fulfilling the "promises" of cheep transactions and quick confirmation times, the users and merchants will go elsewhere. That means that the userbase will plummet, and so will the price. How will bitcoin then be able to provide the value for the "settlement network" that many core developers claims that it has always been. (in the beginning it was only said it could be _used_ as a settlement network, not that it is)

We could start with removing the ban policy of bigger blocks.
Reading further down you bring up blocks (confirmations) that could be mined, indeed that is possible but not practical...
First you need to mine a 1000KB+ block and send to the node before any other miner broadcasts an valid block - with some luck that is indeed possible - but then we have the "longest chain" principle, and building a chain, even with 2 confirmations takes a majority of hashing power - or extreme luck. In any case it won't be economical for a miner to engage in such an attack since it would probably be more profitable to mine a block that would generate an coinbase that can be spent on a majority of the network/nodes.
If you run a node that accepts bigger blocks - don't use a wallet on it - or if you do us a wallet on it - don't trust just a few confirmations on that node to be sure it won't be overrun.
TL;DR; Running an node without wallet that accepts bigger blocks have no security implications or issues - other then possible being banned by other peers/nodes.

You can still accept big-blocks and build on it, while not generating bigger then the existing 1000*1000 sized blocks. sure propagation might lag some, but not by much, and then there is block propagation optimizations discussed (non fork) and SPV mining - so the lag is minimal if at all.

As in the page looking like scam and it uses the same kind of promotions to lure you in.

Indeed the AKB48 voting model makes me not wanting to support AKB48 however I do want to support (some of) the individual idols.
But for bitgirls I will vote as long as I don't have to create an account and can simply send bitcoins by scanning a QR code, perfect usecase for the blockchain including the public record of votes to see that no vote manipulation is going on.

There won't be much difference, DPRK can't afford that many nukes, and one nuke (from them) don't make much more then remove parts of cities, so "the fact that there will be many bitcoins that will never be spent" is not a fact, but rather an incorrect assumption.

If DPRK Nukes anyone it will first of all be the USA, anything else would just be a stupid suicide for them. (with that said if they nuke anyone at all it will be theirs suicide regardless of who)
But back to the point, since the US will get nuked first that means the price of USD will plummet, and crypto (among others) will be there to take up the slack. If Japan get's nuked as well then JPY will plummet and that is also used by many as an extra asset, But South Koreas currency isn't used as much as a fallback by others so that won't make much difference.

Most sites are unique, and can be coded in anything like PHP .NET Java, Python.
And then you have HTML/css/js on top of that.

All this have to be done without opening any security holes, such as database injection, xss etc.
If you have ever done any kind of coding and thinks its easy, I'm sorry to say it you are mistaken.
Sometimes you might find a prebuilt site where you can just drop in a plugin and it's done, but as I said you have to assume thats not the case. And even if it is more times then not you still have to do modifications.

Check the transfer on the blockchain, eighter with blockchain.info blockexplorer or any similar service.
If tou sent one transaction and then a "double spend" then atleast one of the transactions have gone thru - the 47 confirmations is annother proof of that. Yhis means you most likely do not want to attempt a resend, instead try to "reset" the state of your cliient - ofcourse first make a proper backup and then resync.
Confirmations will keep counting up for each additional block, at some point the client will no longer display this but that doeas not mean that "confirmations stop comming in"

First of it is very hard to read or make sense of what you wrote - on the verge on unreadable.
I'm assuming windows is the OS where the genereal On screen keyboard is used, in that case you use "sendkeys" to send keypresses, this emulates normal keyboard input and is what you listen for.
If I'm not mistaken you need admin access to listen to keypresses globally.
If you use an onscreen input built into the application however you need to hook in to the running process to fetch it reliably.
On the other hand OSK atleast removes the possiblity of hardware keyloggers.

Let me fix the title for you: "Bitcoin users need to accept unfavourable exchange rates if they want merchants to accept bitcoin"
Now before anyone says this is stupid, is it really? It's the same thing but the other way around.
It isn't free to use exchanges and there are (volatility) risks, so if you would do the same thing yourself as the merchant needs to do to get fiat out, is it really a lower cost. As with any payment method it needs adoption! And when it comes to bitcoin the ones that want to see adoption is mostly the customers - so we should accept unfavourable price - and if the merchant want to promote bitcoin instead of card they should give a favorable price - but never _never_ try to force a marchent to give you a favorable price just because you want to use bitcoin.

You have a valid point, but Lukes point of attack is that anything that is or could be gambling is an attack on all humans.

@_date: 2015-04-13 19:21:23
You should create a new address for every incoming transaction. For one it makes it harder for anyone to know how much you have gotten or how much you own.
A wallet contains multiple addresses (or private keys to be exact).
Your balance in the wallet is the total of all your generated addresses.

It's still more understandable and thus easy, for anyone that have heard of bitcoin to scan a private key then to go fiddle with weird passwords and stuff. (think about it from a users point of view where they know almost nothing)
@_date: 2015-09-19 22:10:00
Sending one transaction to a specific peer and a double spend to the rest of the network is on the same level as sending an invalid utxos to that peer, the attack vector is thus the same. If the majority of the network relied on this technique there would certainly be problems, but it is more likely to be several full validating nodes. The main point here is that you could use this to query some 3rd party node, or you could run one node yourself that you trust - or you can double check the result against several nodes. Some users might trust one random peer to tell them their truth, and just taking the risk of having an incorrect truth that might bite them later - most of the time that will work just fine. But you are not forced to use it that way.
Even if you have not seen the different variants of why it does not scale, Gavin just debunked them all. It all made sense to me and It's quite obvious that the "factually wrong" bunch is the ones that came up with any of those O(n^2) variants to begin with.
EDIT: actually have to go back a bit on the first statement, an attack utxos could be sent to all peers, while an attack double spend needs to be sent to an specific peer - so it is easier to succeed with the utxos attack since w don't have to direct it to a specific peer, but the victim still needs to connect directly to one of the attacking nodes. Also an utxos providing node should still be fully validating.

Sure you can change the packets to be "accepted" but whats the point? What do you want to achieve?
Every packet, transaction etc have multiple parts that needs to match for it to be accepted. In the end you will just end up modifying the client to be the client of the other network.
If this is some kind of attempt to use your coins from one net on the other it is not possible since the coinbase and incoming transaction ids don't match up.
In theory you could use the same private key on multiple coin networks but the addresses generated from the public key will still be different because of how they are calculated for each network.

The first problem is that you are running Teamviewer and especially leaving it open for web connections. (Whats wrong with remote desktop or VNC?)
Another problem is having your wallet on the same machine as a remote access sw.
One can also say the problem is that you are running Windows - or maybe not - but the combination is kind of a problem.

Ok, I dont know enugh about Trezor to say it is not as simple. But please educate me on this:
Lets say a family member owns a Trezor, They Die, Instructions are provided somewhere, but noone cares and the Trezor is thrown away because because it is "just another piece of electronic junk that he owns" or maybe it was destroyed in i fire.
Now a couple of years later someone sorts thru the papers and finds the instructions (compared to a paper wallet) there no longer is any Trezor to restore any seed to.
To me it still sounds like it would be easier for any family member to scan a private key with any wallet, than it is to understand the concepts of a Trezor. Normally you belive you need such device to restore the coins, even if that is not the case.

With creditcards for example you can demand a payback for up to 6 months, that is a risk for the seller, so in that sense it is a feature since it is more secure in that there is no chargeback.

Note that I used the term "consensus rules" because that is what they are called! And I asked why it is allowed to discuss changes in "Bitcoin core" (the software) which affects the consensus rules (as defined before) even if it is a change to fix a bug, or a change that is by accident, or also an softfork that later prevents older versions to work fully on the "new" network.

LN might be "a good thing" and provide improvement for the US market, but not so much in Europe!

Known stolen coins. For example this one: 
The list would be updated in the client containing addresses and information about why it is a "bad source" This of-course will only be used to inform the user of the possible tainted chain and nothing else.
Lets say someone sends me a transaction with 100% coming from above address, then I would not hand over the bike (instead I would inform the cops) instead if 5% where tainted maybe I would analyse part of it myself, and ask for information where that input came from. and if only 0.01% I wouldn't care. - The goal here is catching the 100% case and heighten my own security.
Since it will be up to the user to make a decision of completing the transaction or not (and maybe return the transaction) based on the information given, The list of "bad sources" and who maintains it wont have any critical impact. (normally this would be collected from reddit or other sources, maybe you maintain your own list etc)

I'm not talking about rejecting anything - only giving the user all information - and a tool to help the user do so.
The wallet can have internal information about good and bad coins.
If there is a small amount of bad coins mixed in I wouldn't care, but if the whole transaction comes from a bad source I would question the sender a loooot more, but not necessarily reject anything.

The whole idea is to detect it as soon as possible, if it the bad address is 3-5 steps away you would raise more questions then if it is step 50.

Segwit is limited to the same blocksize as before - otherwise it would be a hardfork. 35-45% of miners currently signal for actual bigger blocks. Core do not want to activate bigger blocks. They want astronomical fees and a non working network before they do.

just as said, if you mine a chain offline and it was only about the longest chain, it would be easy to create a chain with adjusted difficulty since you can also control the timestamps. so to avoid this the amount of work is used to make sure a longer chain but with lower work, cant override a shorter chain with more work.
@_date: 2015-11-07 15:01:08


True that some of the current nodes might be taken offline and that will increase centralization, But with the increased userbase more and more people will be interested in running a full node, and more will have the ability to do so. but without the bigger blocks it wont support those new users. Also the technical development does not stand still!
If we think of what is proposed instead it is based on centralized nodes connected to the decentralized network. I fail to see how that is a better solution.

And that happens 9 minutes after your buyer left with the goods (think physical store, or even an localbitcoins transaction), yes it just needs to be sent out before the original transaction is included in a block, and then it might be to late.

Anyone is free to signal Segwit but that won't give bigger blocks. If we look at miners that signal for any kind of uppgrade, the majority is signaling for actually bigger blocks, so since Segwit is the miniority here, it is actually the Segwit only signalers that is blocking activation of bigger blocks.
And no Segwit is not actually bigger blocks - if it was it couldn't be a softfork.

I agree, except for filtering, I'm against that. But as I said in response to awemany, It should be a tool helping in detection, not rejection. question the sender if all inputs are coming from bad sources, but not if a small part of intputs have a questionable background - The wallet can then remember this and use it if you need a "clean" transaction and avoid these coins or have an "don't care" transaction where they are used.
Once again it's all about giving the user information as soon as possible, and give the user the choice of not handing over goods because of a tainted coin source.

Some repetition - and this might be just what OP is trying to avoid, but at least this first paragraph should be an ok statement even if many will disagree with the rest.... 
I (still) believe bitcoin can be the cash of the world as an international currency that can be used in stores and on the internet by everyone to buy anything, that is directly as p2p without any intermediary.
As I see it LN will create centralized hubs and it will break the p2p support. I won't mind if it is implemented, as long as we get bigger blocks - but in that case LN will likely be useless.
As someone else said many have disappeared from this sub because of the one sided removal (censorship) of posts about an distributed BIP101 Bitcoin implementation (not an alt! - even if it could be in the future)

Bigger blocks means that the network can accept more transactions, which in turn means that more users can use it, with more users there will be more that can pay fees... but in the end it's all about supporting more usecases which increases the value of the bitcoin network, and from that the value of each bitcoin.

Blocking something that a user wants to use, without their knowledge, or making it hard for them to get around - I think it fits perfectly with the term censoring - but let's be fair you only provide the patch that enables censoring by default.

argh, just posted in the old thread...
Why boycott Gentoo? Only because lacks an understanding of reality and a moral view that is not the same as many others in that CENSORING anything is wrong.
Gentoo just need someone that is better as an package maintainer - but as long as no other exists, I guess we will have this over and over again.
But I rather not have bitcoin in portage, then have a CRIPPLED version in portage.
(that the use flag even exists is bad, that it is enabled by default is just ... unacceptable!)

The upstream spamfilter is based on transaction size and fee (is it not?), Your patch _permanently_ disables some addresses that you dislike while other users might want to use them. Upstream minimze spamy transactions, while you totaly block them.
Sorry for using you here, by that I mean your patchset.

USE flags enabled by default - that enable "features" that is questionable - I would say that is forcing it onto anyone that runs emerge bitcoin-qt that most people just getting into bitcoin on Gentoo will do. Especially since new versions of the flags seems to pop up in every version, so when running your daily upgrades you need to take extra care to not get anything unwanted.

Well Core could always merge the hardfork code and make their best effort to make everyone run it.
What happens if you don't upgrade your node is that you will be on a disconnected network with no, or almost no mining power at all. In practice that means a non working network.

If you don't allow for bigger blocks in ~90 days, then, since the majority of miners have gone for NYA you risk sitting on a minority fork of the chain. (in the last 24h there is still more then 80% of the hashpower that supports NYA) with minority chain of that size will be mostly unusable.
If the hashpower don't change then there will have to be a fork of the old chain as well for it to survive.

Yes you are not allowed to transfer big sums of money without having a money transmitting license. Just keep under the limit, and if you want to transfer more contact a bank or at least take legal advice, this is something that everyone in EU should know about. (what I mean here is that there have been lots of changes in banks and "crackdown" on cash usage)
@_date: 2017-07-27 08:14:34
Regardless the end result is the same, Notice my mention of this


And not only taxpayers, they are actually compensated, but rather all the holders of the currency in question.

How is US law relevant to EU/German legislation?
It is unlikely that Bitcoin has anything to do with the case at all. If you do a transaction over 10000EUR you are obligated to know where the money comes from. For example if you try to deposit even 1000EUR in cash then The bank can deny and are even obligated to contact the Police if you can't explain where the money comes from. This is part of anti money laundering legislation. That's  just facts.

As a miner Which would give you the most payout
1000 transactions with a 0.01 fee or 1000000 transactions with a 0.0001 fee ? Also remember, miners can decides which transactions to include.
Now add that a chain that is limited to 1000 transactions is a lot less useful and therefore worth less, than a chain that allows 1000000, in theory the 1000000 chain can be worth at least 1000 times as much, but due to the network effect it is worth much more.
We actually needed double the block-space at the last halving to not have been as constricted in growth as we now are. :/

Found [this](




As already posted you can follow this lock in at 
right now there is 1352 blocks left until Segwit is locked in, and after that there is 2016 blocks of "catch up" and then it is active. so in about 23.39 days Segwit will be active.
@_date: 2017-07-24 13:26:47
It seems you don't understand how segwit works... What is needed is that nodes does not reject each other (miners are also nodes in that context)
Segwit however uses an already existing Bitcoin script operation... this is the only reason that Segwit can be deployed at all, that it does not require upgrade on all nodes. however since it reuses an old script operation that right now means "anyone can spend" the majority of miners need to enforce that it is no longer used as such since it would result in loss of funds.

None of that is features that some users want.
And yes if you _block_ for example satoshidice - then you are censoring satoshidice for that user - or any users that uses that node. Now how will you support the users that want to use satoshidice from an "default" Gentoo installation and "nothing works" ?

You might want to read [the spec, especially REQ-7](
Some of the open PRs adds more details to it.
This means that I don't think your calculations are correct. Might be worth double checking.
@_date: 2015-02-27 09:48:33


Your patch does... (filter out some things that some users want to use) and it is done by default.
By hard to get around - means needing to recompile and restart client.
My trust in the Gentoo ebuild is zip, zero, nil. as long as you are the maintainer - will always build from source - to bad many other users will be tricked in to using censored software.

Only the contents of the file, if you want to check filename and modification time then you need to add some kind of header.
So to be more precise ... you don't hash the file, only the contents/data.
@_date: 2017-05-29 05:35:21
When hashing, normally the full data of the file is used as input.
But on the same time normally files don't have any wrapping at all.
Or if you by wrapping mean filename etc then you are confusing yourself since the filename is not part of the file - it is outside.

If there is a few companies that forks the protocol, then they will be a minority and probably none will support them, so they will be the losers, at least short term (the trust for them will disappear for one)

That new currency would be worth equivalent to it's followers, so probably close to 0% of current Bitcoin.
Other then that there already is several different "versions" of bitcoin, almost all cryptocurrencies is a BitcoinV2 variant.

Why make a difference between the genders at all? It just sounds like you are assuming (without real facts) that there is less women into bitcoin, Or that they are not included in the first place.

I would never touch dollars (even virtual) but using Euro instead - so you get a upvote.
