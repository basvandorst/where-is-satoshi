Wow, so incredibly honest in the terms... or was it split among screens of legalese?

Nothing to be worried about, but opt out in whatever way possible. SMS spoofing is too easy to be trusted with money.

Any chance of this being transformed to support Litecoin and Dogecoin?

Sounds like the IRS wants to take a stance that Bitcoin gets taxed as much as possible.. but with no "benefits" from being in any related class that would get taxed.

It's somewhat up in the air, and given the ascend rates, I think best-in-category / challenge-based would work best. The idea would be pay once to enter the tournament and unlimited plays... though I suppose a pay-per-attempt would be an idea for the future.
I'm all for suggestions on rules - I'd most likely use the ones junethack has and perhaps use their API for data collection.
I'm considering perhaps doing a limited (lower-fee and limit people) trial run over a week to see how it goes, then kick off a month-long tournament. If that goes well, then I'll see about investing a little more time in making pages/etc to make signup simpler and less manual. 
Current approach: PM me or signup using some form I figure out online, I send out address + challenge to put in your config file.
Better approach: Visit page, submit information, receive address and challenge automatically w/ zero wait on me to get the details.

There's an interface I recently found: "Ebonhack" that sits atop the vt_tiledata patch added to get tiles on the remote server. There's also a flash one directly available for NAO

Oh wow, junethack looks to take care of all the dirty-work of managing tournament details!
So assuming that no patches are desired to get more conducts, we could use that and funnel some network hosting proceeds there instead of hosting independent VPS solutions.
A reason for hosting our own Nethack server would mostly be to more deeply integrate 'premium' features, like buying items for $$$, though any other ideas, I'm all ears! I probably wouldn't do something like that... but apparently lots of others do according to games like *ville where $$$ gets you massive bonuses. Separating these from tournament servers would be good, though, to improve tournament integrity :)

**Minor update**
Due to some awesome suggestions by people familiar with junethack, the signup process can be made significantly easier...
Also - I think due to the devnull contest starting the stroke of midnight November, I'll start the "longer" contest through the month of October and possibly a shorter (2 weeks) contest September. Thoughts?
Can anybody think of a good automated form system (not google docs) that would be good to collect NAO usernames &amp; reddit-user/email address to send responses to (if necessary)?
If all is good, I'll post an announcement before the middle of September and we can go from there.
 * Send message with NAO username and if you need a destination address to send funds
 * If you are using the custom destination flow, you'll just then need to add a challenge phrase I'll respond with and your prize funds to your config file
 * If you are not using the custom destination flow, you'll just send your funds to a standard address I'll setup and properly markup your config file using a signature from a key that was the source for funds going into the standard address (note: thinking this through a little more, it may be a tad more challenging due to the fact that some wallets make it hard to ensure funds come from a certain address - if desired I could cookup instructions for various wallets)
**Markup for custom address**
    # PRIZE ADDRESS=1Ajjjkjjj..
    # CHALLENGE=challenge-phrase
**Markup for signature-based address**
    # PRIZE ADDRESS=1Ajjjkjj...
    # SIGNATURE=Signature-of(PRIZE ADDRESS=1Ajjjkjj...) using a key that was a source of coins sent
EDIT: Formatting fix+

I have this for sale on bitmit ( does the full encrypt disk in one solution.) - probably a little over your cost, though... looking through my other crypto devices that support PKCS You need Linux, or is Windows-only good 'nuff?
Also - have a smart card reader, or need USB tokens?
@_date: 2013-07-03 17:15:06
Just realized I didn't include any reference information:
3rd party store selling the exact tokens: 
Wiki page on how to use them.
If the price seems right - let me know and I'll check out testing TrueCrypt to use the token.
@_date: 2013-07-03 21:32:28
(Edit: fixed as strikethrough)
~~Ah shoot, initial testing seems to indicate that the opensc library does not want to make 'keyfiles' that TrueCrypt uses - it reports "USER NOT LOGGED IN" errors when trying to write the data files to the token.~~
Use opensc 0.12.2 ... not the version in git trunk!
Tested it out and it works perfectly :)
Now.. if you have other uses .. like the crypto capabilities of the token - then things are looking good right now. But if you are really interested in TrueCrypt - I'll look further into what's going on.

Great idea about the options, didn't realize that was a possibility.
Yeah - thinking about the fact about the ascend-at-will, probably need to specifically use conducts as an additional challenge (though I suppose the ascend-at-will people can do this as well :-/)

Sweet - I just got some Aladdin tokens I have work with OpenSC with a few tweaks to the command line for initializing them.
OpenSC works on both Windows and Linux, so you'll be in good shape :)
I might consider doing a one-time deal of 0.3 BTC + shipping for one of these tokens (check out std price of $49.99 + $23 international shipping!)
@_date: 2013-09-03 12:32:41
Yeah, perhaps using devnull's conducts would be much better suited then 1st ascend / highest score. If something does get going. I hadn't thought about the fact that there's been some players with extreme skill that would make this unfair.
Perhaps if a fresh server was setup, adding in the "Extended Conducts" patch or perhaps creating tournament-friendly patches to add challenges.

These are the "Athena" devices  - got the device name mixed up. Technically, these Athena tokens are Aladdins, but flashed with a different software base.
Yes - it is well supported. Once I wiped the pre-configured filesystem, OpenSC worked quite well: generated a keypair, ran the pkcs test-suite
I have worked with eTokens and eTokens in card-factor... however do not have any on hand.
A card is generally easier to carry around, very true.
PM me if the Athena looks good, then we can figure out shipping.
