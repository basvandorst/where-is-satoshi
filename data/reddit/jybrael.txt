Wow that one picture did teach me a lot more about accounting than I think I actually ever knew...Thanks for sharing that mate. I think I am going to go read up on some history of accounting. :-D

I hate how they keep placing bans or strict regulations on Cryptocurrencies everywhere...in the states
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:13:13
I didn't know about those sites. Thanks mate for sharing them with me. I will add them to my bookmark...

Now this is beginning to scare me...I am usually always online on my laptop and my wallet is always connected to the net so I can keep the blockchain up to date...there were times when I left my computer offline for days on ends and when I got back I had to wait a long time to get the wallet synched. Anyways back to the point..if they are monitoring our coins..what should I do if I want to make them secure further?

Thats wonderful news, I have actually always wanted to try playing The Elder scrolls online just never got the time to. Now to go around and get some bitcoins ready for it :D

Converted my Bitcoin to Dogecoin to buy a steam game.
@_date: 2015-07-21 21:11:30
I used Cryptsy to convert it to Dogecoin...
@_date: 2015-04-19 11:36:41
I would say definitely bit coin would be better...the governments wont be able to regulate it as they have no control over it.
@_date: 2015-04-13 13:54:24
:-) This is a treasure trove of knowledge related to Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-03-08 10:08:36
