Okay, I’ll definitely take a look at that site, thank you so much.

But obviously bitcoin isn’t covered if stolen so there really is no reason to have it, personal use would be better

Dude holy crap you’re legit my dad. Thanks so much for taking the time to help me out!!

So what would coinbase be classified as? And I won’t I just heard that through a friend
@_date: 2019-05-20 05:02:02
I just downloaded Green wallet and it seems to have that option. It’s nice because it’s a 30 sent transaction fee instead of $2.00 like on coinbase

Ohhh you just read the spikes. Okay that makes sense now. Thank you!

Thank you so much!

From everything I’ve read, the wallet is actually you owning the bitcoin but the web version is you having the website hold it for you
@_date: 2019-05-20 23:28:56
Yeah I probably need to do that, I’d usually buy $25-$30 at a time and it didn’t help that the fee was $2 each time. Also, I was talking about transferring the bitcoin to other wallets, each time I’d send $5 I’d get a $2 fee
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:32:01
Transaction fees like sending bitcoin to other individuals. And I thought it was a wallet, shows you how much I know ):
@_date: 2019-05-20 04:30:21
Probably 1-2 hours
@_date: 2019-05-19 21:22:50
But it’s not a wallet right?
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:37:16
Thank you, how much do you usually do per transaction and how long does it take?
@_date: 2019-05-19 20:52:42
I’m not to sure how to read that chart. Are the numbers on the y axis the cost?
@_date: 2019-05-19 18:32:44
Thank you, I'll look into that
@_date: 2019-05-20 23:46:34
And you can buy with lower quantities?
