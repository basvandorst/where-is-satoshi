I've been thinking the same thing since I saw the Trump post today. It's the dollar that's printed out of thin air not Bitcoin.

I can certainly relate. Not only my wife, but also my family and closest friends are clueless and think I'm crazy. I tell them not to come whining when my hodling pays off. Don't let anyone discourage you or steer you away. Crypto is the future.

Fuck that

They will all be mined be for that. Only 3 million to go.

Telling everyone to fuck off certainly isn't going to help. Relax. Either hodl or sell and forget about it. Any activity that has you that stressed out isn't good for you. Take a break.

Try to make a sentence or story out of it. Or make some sort of poem or coded message that only you know the solution to. It could be hanging on the wall even and no one would quite understand what it really is and that is just fine.��

Last time I did this I learned that a had a bad ram stick and could not move further until upgrading my ram.

Lol seems like every time I buy it drops. I don't even worry about it anymore. I'm in for the longhaul. Stack sats and hodl.

That's a collectors item. It's worth more than a Bitcoin. Still kicking myself for not picking one up for $800 a few years back.

Thank you

During the silk road days it was less than $100 and you could purchase it by MoneyGram at Walmart and have BTC in wallet before you made it back home. I sold mine off like a fool. You could also buy LTC on eBay for less than $5.

I totally agree that it's a terrible idea as well. Just accumulate slowly by buying every time you get paid or have extra money. It will add up before you know it and you'll still have your 401k as well.

The one you're getting direct deposit on should have an account and routing number. Use that to add a bank account on Coinbase. Then use bank account to buy or sell.

Why do you say that? Just curious of your opinion.

That's a ridiculously high mark up. The one in my town is only about 8 to 9%.

This needs to be the official BTC theme song. You have my vote.

You can loose your ass real easy trading. All you gotta do is pay your energy bill while the miners are running.

Segwit addresses confuse me sometimes. Then I figure out I'm checking the wrong wallet.
@_date: 2019-09-18 23:55:42
Just buy and hold. Be patient and accumulate.

Check to see if you have more than one private key. You can also view the transaction id to see where the funds went. You will need the private key to whatever public address the funds went to.

You're getting a bit extreme in my opinion. During the great depression you're referring to only the poor and middle class were standing in the bread lines. The bread was being produced by the privileged rich men that caused the problem in the first place. They got even richer by buying up everything at dirt cheap prices. I would like to believe that if this were to occur in modern times a BTC holder could either get rich buying up dirt cheap assets or escape to greener pastures. Either way it's better than begging for stale bread. If it's global meltdown you fear, then nothing will help. HODL and stop over thinking.

Sounds like it’s time to switch banks.

No one knows the answers to any of your questions.
