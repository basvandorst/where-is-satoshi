This is what happens when people split into two groups and act like little bitches instead of compromising like adults. If we don't activate Segwit soon it could be the death of Bitcoin. No one will use a currency you can't spend.

You won't lose your money if the transaction is not confirmed after a certain amount of time. it will be returned to your original wallet. In the meantime you can always try using a Bitcoin transaction accelerator like this one:
The best time to submit your transaction ID is at the beginning of each hour.
Just keep in mind that the recent interest in Bitcoin has caused transactions to take much longer than they have in the past.

Supply and demand. The more people who want Bitcoins the more valuable they become.
You can buy and sell Bitcoins at a Bitcoin ATM, or through an exchange like

Given that Y2K was a non-event (where absolutely nothing happened), then yes.

As someone who regularly accepts payment in BTC, I'm always happy to see it dip. What i earn today will be worth twice as much in a few weeks.
