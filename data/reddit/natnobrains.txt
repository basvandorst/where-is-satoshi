Link to the "To the moon" t-shirt and game. Maybe sell them for coins?

That's amazing. I'm really looking forward to buying my first bitcoins soon so I can contribute to awesome things like this.

And now I have to clear my browsing history...
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:19:32
How much do you reckon it will cost?
@_date: 2013-04-11 11:20:38
Please use imgur next time...

It seems that the site was legit, but now isn't.
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:28:34

How long do you reckon it will take to die down a bit? Only just started and am looking to invest soon.

Yes, unless you used the automatically generated wallet that bitcointip bot gave you
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:43:15
Don't beg.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:10:08
It's people like you that make me realise that the world isn't full of assholes.
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:42:43
Where can I find a tutorial on how to do this?

If you downloaded a client, it will be on your hard drive, search the entire drive for wallet.dat. If you deleted it, you may want to splash out on professional file recovery if you think it will be worth it to get it back.

It's ok, most people on reddit use imgur just because it's quick to load and is unintrusive, whereas services like tinypic can take a while to load and the layout looks cluttered.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:15:41
I think I'll something like £40 on and see how far it gets me :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:13:10
And as always, don't spend more than you're willing to lose...

In case you didn't realise, I was making a joke, which is the opposite of serious.
@_date: 2013-04-12 20:21:24
This rap really made my day.
I hope this doesn't end in dismay.
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:01:54
No, it's just awesome

The thing is, the creator of Bitcoin didn't give himself them, he mined for them along with several others.
