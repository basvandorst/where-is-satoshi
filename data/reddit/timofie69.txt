No it's my phone, still accepts my fingerprint on mycellium iOS app
@_date: 2017-07-14 02:46:26
Thanks keep looking.. however it still accepts my finger print to attempt to send funds then after that it says the wallet is locked out... so I was hoping that i still have my "password" in a way

I try to create a backup but it says I am locked out and may need to restore with 12 word seed..phone is not jail broken. Yeah I will back it up now via iTunes is that the best way? Not sure what else to do now...

What's an OTA backup? Is it possible to somehow find the 12 word seed of private key from the data of my phone????
@_date: 2017-07-14 05:41:53
Yeah I wrote it down but seem to have misplaced it... it's weird I am still in the app and can see all the funds just can't send any out so hoping there is a way....

It has locked me out due to iPhone asking to log in to all my apps as if I haven't used Jose apps before eg. Got home and asked to log in to my wifi? Weird, telegram asking to setup account again like it was a new phone.

Still no response from  :(

They didn't give any private keys when backing up on iOS just the 12 word seed.
@_date: 2017-07-21 12:27:31
Yes have tried restarting the phone.. not sure how to attach images on here

I will try export data. Am hoping to jail break the phone and then gain root access to phone via desk top and search for private keys. Will update if this works
