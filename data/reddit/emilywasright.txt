Only a moron would think Stossel does real journalism. Stossel is a moron who wants to undo the equal rights amendment because he thinks businesses should have the right to discriminate against race and religion. His investigations are a complete crock of shit. He is a shitstain on true libertarianism which respects everyone's rights, not just one's own.

Shrem is a fucking moron.
No one should be holding for 20 years unless they are a teenager. Why the fuck should we wait til we're in our 60s and 70s before we can finally enjoy life?
Unload your bags as soon as they are worth it for you. Don't fucking wait until BTC is a million dollars (because by that time, fiat will be hyperinflated to begin with)
@_date: 2019-11-14 17:42:08
This is actually bullshit

business as usual for republicans
@_date: 2019-11-04 16:00:04
you realize two things can be true at the same time right?
yes fiat is manipulated, but bitcoin clearly is manipulated as well.
@_date: 2019-11-29 22:59:45
lol no. republicans tow the party line when it comes to what to promote and trump is anti-bitcoin because he's a dumb piece of shit.

9 years is too fucking long to wait. i don't want to be near death to be able to enjoy my bitcoin riches.
@_date: 2019-11-14 17:42:46
this is discredited bullshit

this is retarded bullshit

lol there is nothing great about Ron Paul
@_date: 2019-08-13 15:03:59
all thanks to Trump
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:56:20
I think the range is something like 25 or 26 to 38 or 39 now
@_date: 2019-08-08 16:21:33
I converted my IRA to 100% GBTC. it was wasting away in a stupid mutual fund for years, only making a few grand a year. if I had gone with GBTC as late as last december/january or in any time early 2017 and prior... well you know the story.
@_date: 2019-08-13 15:17:05
Sounds like you're a demented greedy pathetic individual who hates the idea of a fair society. Go ahead, stock up on assault weapons and revolt. Can't wait for you to get Ruby Ridge'd.

@_date: 2019-08-13 15:17:42
lol its like you want the movie Idiocracy to become a reality
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:10:03
i mean as long as the price never goes below bitcoin i don't see the issue with the premium eventually going away.
@_date: 2019-08-28 15:03:02
there's no way this guy was not satoshi
@_date: 2019-10-08 15:47:25
lol because private secure money is more important than saving the goddamn planet? i'm sure you're gonna enjoy that bitcoin when 99% of humanity is wiped out and you're getting by in a mountain cave and living off rats and dirt.
@_date: 2019-08-13 15:13:14
lol this "article" is nothing more than an ad for Ellipal
@_date: 2019-08-08 15:10:44
this is stupid. aren't you expecting bitcoin to keep rising? that 30% will easily be made up eventually.
@_date: 2019-10-20 22:42:58
lmao how's he gonna afford that on 35k salary
@_date: 2019-10-20 22:39:40
lol non-whales have almost no impact on bitcoin and crypto prices in general. the entire market is completely manipulated and controlled exclusively by whales. and right now some of them are deliberately trying to push the price down to 6k.
@_date: 2019-08-13 15:08:40
lol how is 8500 to 3000 impossible when bitcoin did exactly that in 2018?
@_date: 2019-08-13 15:18:31
lmao only idiots spout this nonsense.
the reality is that we own bitcoin because we think it'll make us rich. you're being delusional by claiming this.
@_date: 2019-08-08 16:17:59
if there are other ways to buy bitcoin in an IRA then greyscale will probably lower their fee or I can just as easily switch to them. Most of us who are shifting to GBTC are rearranging our portfolios, not putting new money into it. I still buy regular bitcoin outside of the IRA.

Pretty sure most people to the right of Fidel Castro don't believe in purging immigrants and keeping the nation white like Trump lovers do.

@_date: 2019-10-20 22:41:14
jesus only 35k? how the fuck do you even live on that kind of salary?
@_date: 2019-10-08 15:48:15
only the most retarded people alive would keep saying this shit. fuck off, climate change denyer.
@_date: 2019-06-26 20:20:58
how exactly do you know that this is the right time to sell? institutions are pushing the price up right now, why would they settle for ~14k?
@_date: 2019-10-31 14:15:56
Sabo can go fuck himself
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:02:31
the US won't ban bitcoin as long as it continues to make the wealthy rich here. they don't give a shit about "terrorist" regimes.
@_date: 2019-06-28 15:59:36
the institutions are the reason for bitcoin's price today, not us normies. getting more big groups to invest will drive the price up better than getting your beer buddies to chip in a few hundred.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:47:36
to be fair, he was probably a victim of politics and he likely didn't commit any actual crimes.

This is not true at all and not even actually communist countries like Cuba or Venezuela do this.
Socialism is merely EVERYONE pays in and gets something out of it, be it public benefits or whatnot. Every country in the world today has some level of socialism, including the United States.

It doesn't describe Lil' Casears, a pizza chain and competitor, whose owner paid the rent for Rosa Parks (civil rights icon) for decades.
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:30:56
I don't understand why anyone would want to buy with bitcoin right now when their coins are going to continue to skyrocket in value. I'd rather wait til bitcoin becomes stable. Which might be 10+ years from now.
@_date: 2017-11-08 20:27:41
I mean we won't mine all 21 million until 100ish years from now, so by then, the guy with 152k will probably be dead and his bitcoins sold.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:31:24
I would never buy Papa John's though. Their owner is a greedy evil man who supports police brutality and screwing over employees w/ low wages.
Wake me up when Lil' Caesars starts accepting bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:45:55
Just wondering how the govt even finds out about crypto profit. I mean does Coinbase send out a tax form to customers and the govt? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:02:13
don't know why these idiots are selling but i'm glad they are. at this rate i'll be able to own 1 BTC even sooner.
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:40:17
bought $280 at $7500 and I feel really stupid now.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:40:50
is it an attack or a correction? either way I hope the price keeps falling so I can buy more more more. only people playing the speculation game are going to lose out.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:33:58
John Schnatter is a known conservative/racist so why wouldn't he be anti-protests? There's no spin there.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:23:11
it hasn't dropped anything. price has been fluctuating between 7000-7500 for the last few days due to speculators.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:45:39
lol wow.
i've actually done his financial peace course before, it was mostly just commonsense stuff if you actually need to get out of debt. i think he'll probably be one of those guys who'll eventually change their minds on bitcoin once they see it's the real deal.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:30:48
do you regret any purchases you made in 2010-2013? I'm sure those coins you spent are probably worth hundreds of thousands now!
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:51:10
I just feel dumb that I bought when it was high. And I was maxed out on my coinbase daily limit when I saw it at its lowest (about $6800ish) so I could only buy like $15 worth at its low.
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:03:09
At .25 right now and incrementally buying every day at lows. Hoping it'll keep dropping faster so I'll get to 1 BTC sooner.
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:38:44
ooh, how soon do you think that would happen? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:42:28
lol just some pump n' dump going on. i see enough of those speculating trash sold off shares that it's dropped back down to 7,100. just in time for me to buy more!
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:32:19
Agreed, which is why I've cut out 99% of my expenses, including food, in order to buy more bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:45:06
Do you have better reasoning behind those specific numbers? Such as, you know specific people with a ton of BTC who are going to sell?
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:35:45
Ouch, that means you sold it at a loss.
Also, 0.1 bitcoin is barely anything :/ hope you find a job asap.

She supports a border wall whose sole purpose is to keep America more white.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:33:08
its gonna take more than just a few years lol. BTC would have to hit 1 million+ for .1 to be worth anything substantial.
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:10:37
I don't know why people think McAfee is some sort of genius. He simply got into the right business at the right time (anti-virus) and that's his sole nod to fame. Anyone could have done that.
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:47:53
Glenn Beck actually isn't alt-right. He followed the same path as other conservatives like Bill Kristol and Morning Joe in repudiating Trump and his platform is now more of a moderate one than a crazy right-wing one.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:29:34
yeah, I guess I should have said purchase to clarify I meant buying a sandwich with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:27:11
I just took out a credit card cash loan so I could buy more BTC, but I have to wait 1-3 days for it to come into my account. Ugh!
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:14:48
you people are dumb if you think 1 senator is going to have any impact whatsoever. plus the other republicans oppose cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-12-04 16:34:23
and Trump is anti-bitcoin and republicans are spineless shitbirds who will follow their dear leader no matter what, so Loeffler will not do anything positive for bitcoin.
update: we're now seeing that dumb cunt defend Trump in the impeachment trial so it's pretty obvious that she's going to lick his boots at every turn.
@_date: 2019-12-02 14:09:52
All of these people using math to predict bitcoin's price are fucking retarded, full stop.
@_date: 2019-12-09 14:50:14
what the fuck? you must be a boomer. stop yelling at the clouds, old fart.
@_date: 2017-11-02 22:25:07
british and aussies actually do say 2 november and it sounds weird
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:08:40
I just feel stupid because if I had waited, I could have gotten in at $6900.
Obv not the end of the world.
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:09:42
not sure why you are making a big deal out of this. this is nothing new and it's going to drop back down shortly.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:45:07
serious question because i haven't been able to find a good answer, but how were people able to retain their bitcoins from 2010? especially when most exchanges went under? did software wallets exist back then?
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:45:00
are your clients stupid? they are throwing away money that way.
no one should be using bitcoin to buy goods/services when the value keeps skyrocketing. it's like paying a million dollars for a cheeseburger.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:23:50
for like 30 minutes lol.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:33:20
Yeah, because you get healthcare and decent wages there!
@_date: 2019-12-12 16:24:36
That's because majority of new jobs are low wages and people are also struggling with student debt, healthcare debt, and other things that filthy piece of shit republicans don't give a shit about.
People are struggling, living paycheck to paycheck, and it's all thanks to Trump.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:30:26
So the first two are the Winklevoss twins? Or do they own one address together?
@_date: 2019-12-05 21:00:14
This is stupid. You'd be able to get more bitcoin by simply asking for the full price in fiat and then buying bitcoin with the profit.
@_date: 2019-12-04 17:08:20
Of course, because she's waiting for her dear leader to give her marching orders on those subjects.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:47:53
Considering how much these people swindle others, it can hardly be considered theirs.
@_date: 2019-04-12 15:54:28
if that idiot hadn't backed Trump and helped Russia elect him then he wouldn't be in this position today.
@_date: 2019-12-09 14:27:17
okay? no one in their right mind is going to pay that much for a bitcoin next year. bottomline, bitcoin's price won't go up unless more institutions buy in, and that currently isn't happening. every chart and prediction out there is nothing but a crock of shit.
@_date: 2018-11-21 15:28:04
so his $600 is worth $13k now? yeah but it was worth almost 60k at bitcoin's peak.
@_date: 2019-09-23 16:41:52
you have republicans and greedy conservatives to thank for that inflation.
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:17:02
