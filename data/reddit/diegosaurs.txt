Unfortunately my job entails opening files from people, I will learn to do my coin business if I ever do invest again off of my PC for sure though. Thanks for the comment I’m sure you’re a joy to be around!

Windows I’m just going to do a clean install I already tried scanning my computer 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:53:06
No, it’s the opposite unfortunately.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:19:48
No I swear to god I still have the *screenshot * from twitch that gave me the virus I just thought I got rid of it

Coinbase phones not open on saturday. Just my luck I guess 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:20:41
There’s nothing I can do to reverse the charge is just says pending?

I can upload the virus total of the file hold on..
edit: 
one of my twitch subs joined my discord and sent this saying it was a screenshot of some girl stream or something, I noticed the weird .scr end of the file so I did do a virus scan and I did realize it was a virus, I just thought I got rid of it. I'm so fucking stupid

The setting only kicks in if you send over 1.2 BTC apparently unless you set it to enable for every transaction.. I'm doing that now, but they didnt need the code because they only sent $800..

I seriously do not get people like you.
Someone sends me this .scr file on discord with the message "This girl is live right behind you with 50 viewers shes going to get banned soon."
Keep in mind this is one of my SUBS someone who pays to support me on twitch, so I open the file and its just some screenshot of a girl streamer whos dress got caught on a fucking chair. You need some help. Seriously.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:40:44
you're wrong
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:42:17
Yeah I know that now, I fucked up big time
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:53:16
only if you have it set to in your settings, its not on by default.. I literally just went in and changed it..

One of my subscribers on twitch..
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:43:35
It says theres over 6 confirmations on the transaction and its says unrecoverable now I will still try to call coinbase tomorrow but I think I just lost everything

Used malware bytes and avast and norton. I finally had manually searched through my computer and I finally found the virus, it was launching a help desk app for remote access as soon as the computer was booted every single time. And yes this was on PC. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:13:22
Not at all, even full system scans. This was the toughest virus I’ve ever seen, that’s why all these comments telling me I’m dumb for getting the virus I’m trying to tell them I’m usually very good about this kind of thing. I’ve never had my PC get infected and I’ve been using one for 12 hours a day since I was 15.. I’m no dummy when it comes to computers but this virus seriously fucked me.. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:18:06
Unfortunately I got it from one of my twitch viewers sending me a *screenshot* I realized immediately that it was fishy and used a virus scanning software to scan my computer. It didn’t work unfortunately I’m so mad at myself 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:33:20
How long will the transaction take? Their phones are not open on saturday I just tried I'm rushing as fast as I can to stop it
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:05:22
Yeah I just wish this didnt happen with so much money and so close to christmas this is embarassing I've never been so legitimately upset with myself
