You're right, you did not. So enlighten me. Why are high fees a good thing?
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:14:56
Nope. The core devs actually pride themselves on high fees. I don't understand it, but that's what they've been aiming for if you check their Twitter histories.

Not a b-cash shill, have never touched the coin, they've definitely got their issues too. I just want Bitcoin to succeed rather than stagnate. The public is quickly learning that Bitcoin tech is old and slow compared to other projects, and unfortunately, public opinion is what will determine adoption. Not us nerds arguing online.
People always say it'll "centralize nodes" yet no one ever backs it up with empirical evidence. So how about we do that instead of your anecdotal claims that 8mb will cause node centralization? I'll post a paper that actually shows there are no adverse effects on decentralization until you hit 4mb (at the time of writing, however it's been since clarified that 8mb is now also safe with current tech).
I'll patiently wait for actual evidence to refute this.

Been in the space since around 2014, not exactly new to the game. You responded but decided not to actually say why high fees are a good thing.
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:09:58
Easy short term fixes are great for what they are. They buy time to work on long term fixes. Obviously you can't just keep upping the blocksize indefinitely, but there have been studies that show negative effects happen only after 8mb. For blockchain to go mainstream, it needs a combination of on and off chain scaling.
If you look at luke jr's Twitter he constantly celebrates high fees. He's said that he looks forward to a future with $1000+ fees.

Probably shouldn't have marketed SegWit as an optional feature then
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:40:57
Why do they have to announce it? So that the price can pump on all the other exchanges instead?
Adding official API support for a coin is as good as announcing it publicly.
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:46:46
But it wasn't. It was in preparation for December, which is perfectly consistent with when they said they would add it (*by* January 2018, not *definitely in* January 2018).
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:43:35
Still consistent with their actions. They made the decision (at a date later than they made the withdrawal decision) to add trading support.

Smart contracts will be legally enforceable. Tons of lawyers are working in the Ethereum community to make it a reality. I imagine the same will apply to Bitcoin if smart contracts are possible down the line

He earned more wealth after being born into an already wealthy family. He had the spare resources to risk. The people that need UBI have nothing to risk if they don't even have enough resources to buy next week's food or next months shelter.
People conveniently miss the part where they have a fall back plan. Worst case, Elon moved back in with his parents if his risks when south. Worst case for a person in extreme poverty, they die if their risks don't work out.

The best time to waste electricity guessing numbers was seven years ago. The second best time is now.

@_date: 2017-08-11 19:09:08
Yeah that's been debated before, but it's probably not too viable unless you live in a constant winter. Otherwise you'll have a significant portion of miners shut down for 6 months every year. Plus with the difficulty of mining, a household heater probably won't generate too much cash

While also dropping from ~95% to ~45% market dominance along the way... You can't pretend Bitcoin is the perfect platform that is skyrocketing far away from all competitors. As you said, Myspace didn't evolve. BTC seems to be going the same route, taking 2+ years to fight over what should have been a quick and easy decision. Not exactly a great indicator of rapid innovation
If anything, BTC has some things to learn from the others if we want it to stay relevant.
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:18:07
Don't do it, you'll be wasting your money. Sure you'll have a little bit of hashpower, but it won't profit you much of anything because of the huge ASIC farms in China.
Mine zcash or Monero and trade for BCH/BTC/whatever other coin you want. That way you'll actually make some money and will be able to sell the hardware down the line or use it for gaming. An ASIC for BTC doesn't really have any future value 
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:14:36
I agree, we should most definitely use censorship to help keep Bitcoin censorship free
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:44:03
You'd need a trusted third party to provide the result for who won. Or you'd need to structure the incentives so that it's in everyone's best interest to tell the truth about who won. So it's not exactly a trivial problem

• Go to exchange and buy bitcoins
• Download bitcoin wallet
• Send your bitcoins to your bitcoin wallet
• Nothing happens *(for 5 hours) and they think they fucked up
I mean, this is what already is happening with BTC. The avg joe doesn't know that there is a scaling war and will think they did something wrong
@_date: 2018-03-29 04:12:40
Gotcha, misunderstood what you meant. I agree with that, I'd throw all mining profits into ETH as well. In preparation for PoS
@_date: 2018-03-28 13:20:58
No? Anyone that mines to make money knows that you mine what's most profitable given your setup and current market conditions, and then sell for the actual coin you wanted all along.

If he was a maximalist, he probably wouldn't have funded Vitalik through the Thiel Fellowship... Probably wouldn't have given Aragon's Jorge Izquierdo funding either.

Well I was just providing counterarguments. Obviously he's pro BTC as well, not denying that. He was trying to create an alternative currency himself afterall
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:07:39
And the bad block in BTC back in 2010 was a result of good code, right? We should have allowed those guys to keep their 184,467,440,737.09551616 BTC because code is law, right? They were transacting according to the rules of the blockchain, and those very rules gave them all of that coin fairly. It's not like Bitcoin would have died if you just moved on and let those two people keep their 92 billion BTC.
For the uninformed:

I didn't argue with that either, I just brought up that it was a soft fork because they asked if anyone was still mining some other chain that this incident happened on.
Whether it was a soft fork or a hard fork, a transaction was censored/reverted. The very same Bitcoin that people tout as uncensorable, had to censor a transaction that would have jeopardized it's future. Immutable financial code is difficult to write.
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:46:14
It was a soft fork so there was no chain split. Though the point still stands that code was deployed to revert/censor a transaction that would have severely crippled (or more likely, killed) the Bitcoin project if left untouched.
And yes two addresses had balances of more than 92 billion.
@_date: 2017-09-29 00:13:25
But that would be completely on you. They make it very clear what coin on what chain you are buying. That would be like going to coinbase now, expecting to buy Bitcoin Cash, and being pissed when they credit you with BTC
@_date: 2018-03-21 00:43:48
It's being done through smart contracts. Bitcoin has nothing to do with this

I honestly thought the article was decent. Seems to be more focused on asking the questions in advance, rather than in hindsight. Asking the gender politics extremists what they're going to do about this coming revolution, what changes/work/policies they think would enact to help the ecosystem evolve.
It's easy to complain about the inequalities in the past and present systems in hindsight, but very difficult to put forth the ideas to sculpt that ideal future. At least that's I thought what he was getting at
