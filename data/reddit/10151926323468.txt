Uh, you don't think the US military has bases in other countries and ships on the sea to protect US trade interests? Back in time, the US literally sent out [military expeditions]( to FORCE the Japanese to trade with them because they were only trading with the dutch. So in a way the US whole trade with Japan is predicated on their military strength.

Lol. But if a currency is backed by gold, what's the gold backed by?
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:28:55
Foreign countries should invest in USD because that will allow them to buy US products and trade with them.

Not sure if you're being sarcastic or not.
My poops are very rare as well. After all I am the only one who can make them. I should probably start selling them ars rare materials.

Bitcoin legacy is not borderline mainstream. Steam, the most important game retailer, adopted Bitcoin legacy as a payment method and then ditched it again because the fees were too high. As it turns out, people don't like paying a $20 fee for a $30 game.

I can't tell if you're sarcastic or not.

You're only fooling yourself. We're talking about Bitcoin Cash because the legacy Bitcoin is slow, expensive, and abandoned when it comes to e-commerce. 
I mean, open your eyes for a sec. Steam has already ditched Bitcoin legacy. What are you expecting really? That everyone just stands by idly as Bitcoin legacy goes to shit? Ain't happening.

[This is an advertisement for bitcoin from a few years ago.](
Now tell me which bitcoin the ad is for. Legacy or cash?
Steam doesn't even accept bitcoin legacy these days.
It's a sorry state of affairs.

Forking bitcoin when things go south is the intended use as designated by Satoshi's whitepaper.

What exactly is a "top developer"?
The bitcoin legacy development team is owned by [federal reserve bankers and other shady people.](
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:03:35
There is no such thing as "taking over the brand". The fork is intended as it was written in Satoshi's whitepaper.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:01:31
It's succesful because it is faster, cheaper and more decentralised than legacy bitcoin.

Looking forward to paying $8 for my $3 beer
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:04:59
It's more like someone writes a whitepaper about how to design a cryptocurrency, which the developer team then diverts from, and folks therefore fork the Legacy chain, also as intended in the whitepaper.

Make the case for legacy as a e-commerce solution then.
Because you can't.
Even tech/crypto enthusiasts are unable to use it as a payment method.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:02:34
Bitcoin Cash has already replaced Bitcoin Legacy when it comes to e-commerce. :)
The ship has sailed.
Steam has abandoned Bitcoin Legacy. For good.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:25:19
Bitcoin legacy will soon be irrelevant. It's useless. Can't pay for shit with it and compromised by the federal reserve.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:19:54
Bitcoin legacy fudded itself by leaving vendors and consumers in the dark for YEARS about what's going to happen to the high fees and slow confirmation times.
Steam, Newegg and Microsoft have all stopped accepting bitcoin legacy. But not because of "FUD", no it's because the crypto is broken.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:07:46
Legacy chain is the chain that's dying. Steam or Newegg won't pick up Bitcoin Legacy again in two weeks, so you're shit outta luck.
Bitcoin Cash is the e-commerce Bitcoin, as originally intended in the whitepaper
