You may find "[The Scientific Case for P≠NP]( by Scott Aaronson, interesting.

I think here are [Mr. Nakamoto's posts]( to the cryptography mailing list to which you refer.
Here are [Mr. Nakamoto's posts]( to bitcointalk.

Leaving aside the question of your 401k for the moment -- as the person above said, if Bitcoin succeeds you aren't going to need very many, so you have another option.
It sounds like you are currently employed.  I would advise you to go to [Coinbase.com]( sign up, connect it to your bank account, and set it to automatically debit your bank account every two weeks with whatever amount you are comfortable with.
Say you tell Coinbase to withdraw $250 every two weeks.  Then you'll be buying Bitcoins every two weeks at whatever the spot price is that day.  This will implement a form of dollar cost averaging, which helps you (slightly) control your risk.

Do you have a citation for this claim?

Sorry, I'm ignorant here -- how is the work Namecoin does any more or less useful?
It's not folding proteins or something is it?

Something is wrong with that site, no?  There are at least 12 x 10^6 BTC in circulation, but it only reports 1/6 of that.

Can anybody point me to an explanation of how this message was encoded in the Bitcoin transaction?

I would recommend that you make a backup of the hard drive for that notebook computer.  In a few years, you may be able to pay someone a few satoshis to recover it for you.

Regarding your first point, one can imagine a proof of work scheme that involves running arbitrary computation, using probabilistically checkable proofs for verification.
In which case the only ASIC one could make would be a faster processor than Intel or IBM.

I agree with everything you said except for the "first major user" part.  Isn't `git` a major user of [chained hash record-keeping]( since 2005?

Oops, I'm an idiot.
Interesting analysis about the distribution wealth in the Bitcoin economy.  Thanks for posting it.

Very interesting idea.  Can you elaborate?

If he can find somebody willing to sell him a house or car for bitcoins -- does capital gains apply then?

Thank you for doing this.  I think it sets a great precedent.

It's a bit strong to say that "it's not possible".  If you are not already familiar with them, you might want to read about [probabilistically checkable proofs](

Please look into [BIP 0038](

Can anybody explain how these accounts are getting compromised?
If its simply that they have weak passwords, then ok.  But if its a weakness in Mt. Gox infrastructure, two factor won't really help.

Perhaps you are not aware of the "Reflections on trusting trust" paper?

Hi.  Thanks for your reply.
Your objections are well-founded.  That's why I specifically mentioned [probabalistically checkable proofs](
