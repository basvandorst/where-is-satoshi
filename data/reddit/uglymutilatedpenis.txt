What happens when 1 satoshi is worth $100 USD? How are you supposed to pay for a coffee, or bus ticket, or anything that is worth less than $100 USD?
You can't. But if we allow people to trade fractions of a satoshi, suddenly you can trade 3 hundredths of a satoshi for a coffee. Nobody is suggesting that this would suddenly lead to everybody being 10z wealthier. It just facilitates low value transactions.

Slices of banana are not the currency, bananas are. If we only trade whole bananas, I can't purchase something that costs less than one banana. But if we chop the banana up into 100 slices, suddenly I can trade fractions of banana. 
No new bananas are created in those process. People just start trading smaller parts of banana.

Bitcoin transaction fees are a flat per-byte rate. The transaction value does not determine the fee. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:16:20
Yeah, that's sort of the point. If the currency becomes too valuable, it can't be used in small transactions. Imagine if 1 satoshi had the purchasing power of $100 USD. Nobody would be able to buy coffees or bus tickets or groceries, because they would be paying a minimum of $100 for something that isn't really worth $100. So we allow people to trade fractions of a satoshi. You can now pay 3 hundredths of a satoshi for your coffee. Problem solved. The currency is now useable. You don't need to explain the concept of inflation, we're not five years old, we know you can't just print money to make more wealth. Adding greater divisibility is not the same as printing money.

Because governments are so big, stable, and important to our economy they are able to get very low interest rates - basically, if the government stops paying their debt, the whole economy is probably fucked anyway. 
Series EE bonds pay 0.10% interest. Inflation was 2.1% in 2017. This means the real interest rate is negative. The government pays back less money (adjusted for inflation) than it borrows. If I offered you a loan with a negative interest rate, would you accept it?
They also have debt for the same reason any entity has debt - they think their returns will beat the interest. Apple holds billions of dollars in debt despite being a profitable company. If the government can pay $1 billion to build a road that creates $5 billion of economic activity, they view that as being worth it.

The value is not exactly the same but I can predict the change in value and so plan my transactions and business around it. Markets hate unpredictability and love stability. If I have 1 bitcoin today, who knows how much I can buy with it in 2 years time? It's useless as a store of value because it's future value is completely unpredictable.

We haven't actively tried to have deflation but it has occurred. 
In the lates 90s to mid 2000s Hong Kong experienced deflation, exceeding -6% at some points. They went from full employment during the inflationary period (&gt;2% unemployment due to the natural rate of unemployment) to their highest ever unemployment at 8.5% in 2003. Their GDP stagnated and they lagged behind their inflationary neighbours. Consumer spending did stagnate (normally it would slowly increase) so evidently people did decrease their spending.

Oh, I misunderstand what you were saying.
In that case, it gets cheaper but the value is also lower. Because it is a year older, it's value depreciates (e.g less support from the manufacturer on older products, phones are unable to run the latest apps due to inadequate processing power, TVs lack the specifications to run latest media due to new connection or broadcast standards, higher resolutions, introduction of 3d etc.) Additionally, as these once expensive items become cheaper the effect of conspicuous consumption is lost - i.e having a 4k TV isn't as much of a status symbol as it was a year ago, so on that basis consumers value it less now than they did a year ago.
So if you wait to buy electronics, you get it at a lower price but you generally value the product less than if it was purchased sooner.

We tolerate it because we don't want people sticking cash in the bank and getting rich off it. 
We want them to invest in businesses, or spend it on consumption. Wealth should be better stored on factories and machinery than cash in a vault. Cash sitting in a vault doesn't really help anyone. Factories provide jobs. That's why the government wants you to invest your money instead of just leaving it sitting in the bank.

They're not cheaper next year, they're more expensive in nominal terms. TV this year will cost $1000, next year inflation means it will cost $1100. That's an increase in price. Buy now before the price goes up.

The reason it is being lent out is because of the sub-inflation interest rates.  Interest rates on loans are also low, so money is cheap. This means people are more likely to take risks and start businesses. If interest rates were high, why would I bother risking hundreds of thousands of dollars opening a restaurant when I could get risk free returns from a bank? 
[It's also not actually being lent out as much as it was when interest rates were significantly higher - excess reserves (spare cash that commercial banks store at the Federal reserve) are orders of magnitude higher now than at any point in the USAs history.

The price in real terms has not risen. What happened is that the bitcoin lost purchasing power, so the price in nominal terms rose.
Bread did not cost more bitcoin because there was a global shortage of bread. It cost more bitcoin because bitcoin was worth less. That's why inflation is an "increase in the **overall** level of prices" - the reason why ALL prices rise is because the one common variable - the value of money - falls. This is inflation.
I have given you a very clear definition of inflation from one of the most esteemed economists and textbook writers alive today.

It literally is. 
Definition of inflation, from Mankiw: An increase in the overall level of prices.

If bitcoin's value lowers relative to other goods, what happens to the price of the other goods? Before, this loaf of bread cost 0.1 btc. Now bitcoin's value lowers and the loaf of bread costs 0.2btc. Is 0.2&gt;0.1? Yes, therefore the price has risen.

That's a very common but ultimately incorrect understanding of the Fractional Reserve system.
Fractional reserve just means that banks have to keep some money behind (called the reserve) in order to provide liquidity to people who have deposited money at the bank.
Eg. I deposit $1 million in my savings account. With a reserve requirement of 10%, the bank can then lend up to $900,000 to other people as loans. They must keep $100,000 as "vault cash" (i.e physical cash sitting in the bank's vault) or as a deposit at the reserve bank (i.e cash sitting in the Federal reserve's vault).
Where is money created "from thin air" in this system?
$1 million existed before, $1 million exists afterwards.
Also worth noting that while 10% is the minimum reserve requirement there is [currently a huge glut of excess reserves in the USA]( - i.e there is a shitton of cash sitting around in bank vaults, not being spent. Why would they create loans out of thin air instead of using all this cash?
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:27:45

That's precisely the point. If you don't find any investments worth investing in, you *won't* invest in them. The fundamental law of demand is that demand is equal to marginal utility.
If you would rather have $1 million cash than $1 million of stocks, or than starting a business with your $1 million, you will keep it in cash and save it. That's why high levels of savings are viewed as a bad thing - it means that people are valuing cash more than actual productive assets (presumably because they believe that the stock market it about to crash or a recession is about to hit). When a piece of paper is worth more than a piece of machinery, that's viewed as being a bad sign.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:35:12
But it doesn't? You can practice fractional reserve banking with bitcoin. Literally, just take the example given above but divide by 1 million and replace the $ sign with bitcoin. 
I deposit 1 BTC in my savings account at the Bitcoin bank. With a reserve requirement of 10%, the bank can then lend up to 0.9 BTC to other people as loans. They must keep 0.1 BTC as "vault cash" (i.e 0.1 bitcoin sitting in their wallet).
This is fractional reserve banking, with bitcoins. At what stage did they "make more bitcoin that were indistinguishable from normal bitcoins?"
Additionally, you never explained why banks would **need** to create extra money "out of thin air" using this money creation tool that they don't possess, instead of spending[ the trillions of dollars in cold, hard cash they have sitting around,]( beyond what they are legally required to keep.

Its bad because you are keeping your wealth stagnant when it could be growing. This increases not only your own quality of life but also the quality of life of everyone - the money you spend could be used on R&amp;D into a cure for malaria, it could fund the building of a factory in Ethiopia that provides a livelihood for hundreds of people living in poverty.
It might seem okay to be like "Duuude, consumerism, is like, bad. Why don't we all just, like, slow down and love each other instead of fighting in this constant rat race? ������ if you live a comfortable middle class life (payed for by the consumerism of others) but the reality is hundreds of millions of people live in extreme poverty. They desperately need economic growth to avoid a short life of malnutrition, illness, and pain. Spending money is one of the most charitable things you can do.
Unspent money is wasted potential. A new factory will clothe more people than a dollar bill. You can't cure disease or feed a child with dollar bills. That's why we don't want people stuffing cash under their mattress.

Inflation decreases the real interest rate of loans.
Imagine if you wanted to start a business, so you took out a loan of 10 Bitcoin (about $10,000) in early 2017.
A year later the value of the loan you have to pay off is over $200,000. How can your business possibly survive when your annual interest rate is over 2000%? Your business will be forced to liquidate, all your employees will lose their jobs. If instead of a business, you were taking out a btc mortgage to buy a home, you would be forced to sell your home and spend the rest of your life renting, paying your wages to an elite class of people rich enough to buy property without taking in expensive debt.
Without inflation, we would not have Amazon or SpaceX or Tesla or Uber. All these companies relied on cheap debt to quickly expand. They didn't (some still don't) turn a profit until well down the line when they had huge volume.

You can buy 500k worth of ASICs but then a year later you can't sell them. Who wants to buy your used, outdated hardware? If it was still profitable to use them, you wouldn't be selling them. So you have to factor in the costs of depreciation along with the accounting costs (electricity, mostly).

The links just back up what I said. 
Here's an example with, but with bitcoin (as you are aware, the supply of Bitcoin is limited and cannot be increased by a central bank):
There are 21 million Bitcoins, so the money supply is 21 million. You can do 2 things with money - save it or spend it. 11 million Bitcoins are out great being spent, and you hold 10 million Bitcoins. You give them to the bank as savings. Because they are not being spent, they are a *leakage* in the circular flow of money. The bank then gives out 9 million btc worth of loans, using your money. Loans are therefore an *injection*, because they take money that wasn't being spent (savings) and make it money that is being spent (loans). 
The money supply has grown, because 
11 million spent + 10 million being saved + 9 million being spent (loans) =  30 million btc total. But the circular flow of money has not exceeded 21 million (11 being spent + 9 million being spent due to loans = 20 million total). We're not creating money or spending money that we don't have. 
At the end of the day, there are still only 21 million Bitcoins, and the bank still loans out 9x what it holds in reserve. This is fractional reserve banking.
