Yep. The swings are real. I'm $5k in since it was 9.6k per and... I'm tempted to take my 1.5k and run, but at the same time, fuck that.

Yep, and even if it does dip nobody can judge how much it'll be. Maybe it dips 20% at 20k. Maybe it dips 50%. Maybe it dips 10% and you wait for it to go lower and it rises again immediately. Nobody knows, so fuck it, cost average.

my only issue about that is, how much of my financial portfolio can I afford to have in bitcoin? I mean, if it crashed to 0 right now, I'd have lost 5k - not a big deal. I honestly have no idea how to judge how risky I want to be.

btc futures will be available

We can hope. At some point it evens out (unless the dollar/euro actually fails in which case we're all fucked anyways).

Yep. Me then: lol .01 of a bitcoin wtf is that no way I'm going through the effort of learning it
Me now: ...I hardly knew you, mah $100

I'm at 6.25% of mine and I wish I'd just said fuck it last year. I'm okay with this, though. I've been thinking about buying a new car with savings but... I'm going to go with btc instead. Fuck it!

Lol. How'd you arrive at that number?

Interesting, how does that work for coinbase? Do they just hold the coins at that price until receiving bank verification?

As it stands, I think a plurality of people in charge of networks/servers have actually been fired over mining on company money/time. It's almost [funny]( that dude was mining for TWO YEARS using federal reserve computing power... one year of probation and a $5k fine? I hope he held lol. Most of the people I know know "that guy". I feel like that's going to get more prevalent. Especially among network admin at the top of the food chain at small-midsize companies who aren't held accountable to anyone.

I mean, if we're talking about the majority of (american, can't speak for others) people... I'd argue that "the herd" don't trade stocks or forex or do anything beyond glance at their 401k statements once in a while, either. So expecting everyone to get into btc is a bit much. I guess if you cull the meaning down to "people with money to invest who are interested in investing" then yeah, the whole herd isn't on board yet. But it's a larger proportion than you might think.

China's been trying out different forms of regulation for years, though. Not saying they'll never outright kill it but at this point it's less a possibility than ever before.

I'd absolutely sell half of it just to ensure I'm never, like, impoverished/on the streets/can forever maintain my current standard of living. The rest, though? To the fuckin' moon.
