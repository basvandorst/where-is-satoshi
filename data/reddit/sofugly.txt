Do you still have them? I wonder who the user was 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:52:34
It’s manipulation plain and simple 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:17:40
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:57:03
It’s the same amount of bitcoin. If you had 0.2 bitcoin you’ll have 0.2 bch 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:19
It’s not dropping it’s sitting at 16.5k roughly 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:22:49
is that real wtf 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:56:15
I wish I didn’t feel I had to spent my last 600 on drugs and shit for New Years. If I could live with myself sitting and home and doing nothing for the next month I would have hopped in too lol 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:22:06
It’s unbelievable, I really want my bcash to confirm so I can sell 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:46:39
I haven’t bought more bitcoin since it was $5500. I’m not worried 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:01
It’s already back above 15.2k. It’s at 16.5k now. You did well 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:28:04
It’s hilarious. I’m trying to sell my bcash right now for more bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:34
To do with fork. I’d sell out at the top personally 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:32
I’m trying to sell mine on bittrex right now 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:38
No. Sell all bcash and buy bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:27:30
Bcash at 9.5k on GDAX
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:33:10
Sell it directly on the exchange 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:55:46
Arbitrage supposedly cannot persist. That should correct very very quickly 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:18:08
Start participating my friend. I’m ready to sell my BCC on bittrex right now and then buy more bitcoin with it 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:43:18
Relax. Manipulation, pumping, 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:38:01
Do not sell!!!!! Never sell in the red!!!!! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:02:36
Maybe just think of it as a coin that you don’t really intend to use to buy things. In that sense imo it’s actually better to have high fees, and that might sound crazy but it’s almost like a barrier of entry and may be an incentive to just hodl or whatever, rather than spending it on cups of coffee
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:47:14
Manipulation, pumping. The money will flow back into bitcoin shortly 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:38:47
I hope it still gets traded down to 1k lol 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:59:32
It seems unlikely in the sense that such a comparison would be irrelevant. By that I mean the only thing that drives up the price of bitcoin is financial motivations, not consumption. Essentially I think that people will only ever use bitcoin financially and not as a currency, and 210T in purely financial flows seems unlikely. If 1 satoshi=1 dollar in my head I’d just be rich enough to put some of my bitcoin back into fiat and I would then spend that. 
By financial I mean as a savings account, investment, speculation etc. and whatever other fishy shit the wales do with their bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:40:53
Rubbish. There will be many winners but do not expect bitcoin to even be close to a loser. The only losers are those who purchased BcH today 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:37:03
Have you seen the sell wall on GDAX? 12k bcash sell and only 76 Bcash buying lol 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:45
Yeah I’m trying to sell my bcash for bitcoin right now 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:42:19
Unless I’m right and this is all manipulation. I’m very interested to see if this is just a mistake or a pump and dump 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:48:47
Don’t ask these questions on such an exciting day lol 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:48
On what?????? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:36:30
Yes I think it’s manipulation. Orders frozen dead on 9.5k 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:46:24
Bittrex is working 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:36:51
Hard if you complain give us your bitcoin. Otherwise sit tight and relax 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:32:48
It’s stuck. Orders frozen?!???
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:50:29
Yes but bittrex is working fine and trading at 3.6k. It’s hard to believe it’s innocent. Bitcoin trading is open on GDAX and bcash is locked solid 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:45:23
Nice! Where is a definitive minute by minute bitcoin price? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:54:09
Oh shut up. You know what I mean. You probably didn’t even own bitcoin, you don’t sound genuine. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:01:15
Well why though. There has to be a reason for something to be a bubble and a reason for it to pop. Tech companies were vastly overvalued but I think it’s far more difficult to really put a value on a bitcoin.  With how few of them there are what actually monetary value should each one have? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:01:36
I’m tempted to sell all my bcash for bitcoin right now 
@_date: 2018-09-08 23:45:19
I think inflation changes the values. $100 is 1918 money will be worth a lot more today. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:36:00
If it’s on bitcoin, yes it will go back up. Please do not sell 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:39:01
It’s locked down. No trades going through. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:48:15
You little bitch 
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:49:00
Any reason to buy monero right now? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:57:45
What are you talking about. I’m only referring to GDAX here 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:41:37
Does nobody like bittrex anymore? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:47:38
This is a very fun day for sure 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:48:23
It’s such manipulation? Build up a huge buy wall and then open the orders to pump up price even further? 
@_date: 2018-09-03 00:43:52
I think that many coins being dumped at once would certainly have a bigger impact than $200... what you don’t consider is that the volume isn’t in terms of fiat its mostly (probably) in terms of bitcoin being sent to other wallets. Bitcoin cycling through hands or even through one guy moving it in between wallets is different from a whale throwing 1b into an exchange and seeing what happens.
However, I can’t think of any real reason to sell now. Someone would have to be under the influence of a very strong external motivation to sell now, during a bearish cycle, when they could likely have just as easily sold at the peak. 
The only circumstance I can imagine someone selling now would be that they are set to make way more money from say, shorting bitcoin, than they would be thru the loss of selling off so many coins. However, this also seems relatively unlikely because although I believe the affect would be higher than a $200 drop, I really can’t lie and say I have any way to accurately predict how the price would fluctuate with such a sale. Is there really any guarantee that it would fall enough to justify selling so many coins? 
There could be a political motivation to attempt to drop the price. 
Could be related to Silk Road 
 But either way, there’s a multitude of reasons why someone might be putting such a large volume onto an exchange. But at the end of the day, an exchange is for exchanging, so why else do it? 
Anyone have any theories? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:53:27
Bcash gets pumped like crazy and then those in the know sell. They then buy the discounted btc and that returns, this time it will go over 20k. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:19:37
I’ve done %1700 percent or something, turned $3.75 of vertcoin into $50 odd dollars. There’s plenty of money to be made in the penny stock memepool and that’s where you should day trade and play around. Buy and hold lump sums of bitcoin that’s what I say
Edit: wtf is %1700 percent 
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:09:25
Well I suppose demand makes it worth more. And sure if the demand drops away the price will dip. It just seems hard to picture 90% or more of current demand all of a sudden falling off 
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:52:13
You’re just scared. Never sell in the red, buy more. Only ever sell when you’re way in the green and ready to buy hookers, drugs, alcohol, your lambo, or your yacht. If you sell in the green you’re scared and you should get out of crypto and go back to your 401k 
@_date: 2019-03-09 05:54:57
Is there anything wrong with just using bread wallet? Please someone advise me so I can set up cold storage because I always thought bread was plenty good enough. Thanks 
@_date: 2018-10-10 03:31:15
I think it was Hal Finney so dead
@_date: 2017-08-06 10:39:48
How could anyone realistically assume he's alive? 
@_date: 2018-06-26 23:38:52
This entire thread is full of negativity, it’s understandable given current circumstances. Why are many of you so scared? Whilst the price was climbing at an unprecedented rate all you did was spread good cheer, and go on about how much you believed in bitcoin and the block chain and how much it was all going to change the world. Has all of that all changed now that you’ve lost profits or lost money? 
If you really believe anything you said when you were making money, then just hunker down and wait. Life is fine, bitcoin is down sure, but it will go back up. If you really believe in it then just kick back, it will turn around and head back up. And at the end of the day, even if it doesn’t, at least I know I had enough of a pair to not succumb to fear and bullshit and stuck with what I thought was right; no matter the conclusion, I’ve learned a lot about investing and I’m still standing so fuck it. 
@_date: 2018-06-27 03:02:14
It’s obvious why people are scared. My comment was pointed towards those who had insisted they believed in what bitcoin and crypto stood for, and who believed that the technology could change the world. The people who believed that should still believe it, regardless of the price dropping, and shouldn’t be so afraid, because if you truly believed bitcoin was going to make it then you believe it will go back up. I believe it will go back up and that’s why I’m not negative. I may well be wrong, sure, but you can’t fault me for changing my mind every time the price fluctuates, because I’m not changing my mind. 
@_date: 2019-04-13 23:58:02
With inflation targeting leading to 1-3% inflation per year, with adjustments to nominal wages and savings offering an interest rate at least as high as the inflation rate, nobody is getting poor via inflation.
@_date: 2017-05-20 09:13:54
Does that hold true for today? 
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:40:28
Chart won’t tell you much at this point. Take a little profit if you want but I believe it’s too soon. There’s no reason to sell yet at all, but if it makes you feel better good for you
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:38:26
What did you buy at
@_date: 2017-06-17 06:45:21
Did you at least manage to take all your money out to buy bitcoin with?
@_date: 2017-06-18 02:41:43
I use breadwallet. If I know the seed or whatever word code thing, can I access my coins in any other wallet?? 
@_date: 2019-05-13 21:00:17
Bcash is only useful for pumping and dumping like a multitude of other shitcoins... if you can make money on its swings then good for you but otherwise stay in a coma on bcash...
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:39:41
There won’t be enough stored in exchange hotwallets to guarantee you’ll be able to withdraw, because so many others are taking profits and withdrawing. I don’t know if that’s true but it does make sense to me and I believe that’s what the gentleman meant
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:30:48
Don't even look at the price just buy every time and never sell that's the lifestyle baby 
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:41:10
Good stuff same here. Literally my last $500 went in at 5k, idgaf and it’s turned out well so far
