It won't cause a price spike, the tether folks would be trapped once the fraud is revealed, they instantly go to zero so they can't flee to bitcoin.
Those holding crypto would see it's real value deflate without tether propping it up.  That would cause a price crash and a stampede to USD.

Worst case? It goes to zero because a viable black market alternative shows up since that kind of transaction is the most viable use of coins - paying ransomware, drugs, etc.

This entire thread shows why "being your own bank" is going to be too complicated and risky for 99.999% of the global population.
"Banking the unbanked" and other such nonsensical ideas won't happen when it's this easy to setup a fake bank and rob it.

I fail to see how keeping coins at all in any form is good advice if tether is a fraud.  Better to protect you assets by moving to fiat and buying back in after the massive drop in price.
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:34:40
The whole cryptographic currency market is a lottery right now, not just the ALT coins.  All of the pricing is purely based on speculation that it will go higher.  That's why things like this NK can swing it so much so fast, they call into question if the party isn't already over.  Which leads to a rush to the door by so called weak hands (read: Wall Street investment types) to do some profit taking .
We're all playing a game of musical chairs here waiting to see who the last sucker is going to be.

Those "weak hands" are what inflated it in a frenzy to over 19k.  Without that kind of baseless speculation  you won't see a bull run like that in a while.

@_date: 2018-01-18 12:01:15
I'm not sure anything that goes from 2k to 5k to 10k in a matter of a few months, follows by 10k to 19k in a month is organic. While behind closed doors futures contracts are being planned and forks are occurring that make current holders free money.  All the while the currency is getting slower and more costly to use.
Fundamentally what changed?  None of the issues that appeared to be driving the price during that period are sound.   And that's even if we overlook tether's unusual activity, which further calls things into question.
Call it FUD, but this run up since at least 2k makes no sense on a fundamental level.  Bitcoin experienced no new technology upgrades that are widely adopted yet, functionality got worse, but saw its price explode.

The big difference with fiat is its actual useful currency, in contrast bitcoin which is being treated as an speculative investment.  So I'm not sure why you feel like this is similar to a situation at all with any of the major stable fiat currencies.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:32:30
Valve needs to be removed from the list, and everyone on it simply immediately converts it to fiat.
It's like saying "all these companies accept VISA" or even more accurately "all these companies accept checks."
Until they actually use the coins for something as well, it's just a token to them for $.

Most of this volume has also been just trading as investment, actual use as a well established payment network would be far higher.

Because it's not a risk.  They make money off loan activity and I don't see how Bitcoin messes with that.  Plus there are a number of things that make savings held in a bank account better than savings stored in a Bitcoin wallet such as:
- I don't have to guard my bank against theft myself
- My bank account is insured against loss.
- My bank account is monitored against fraudulent transactions which can be reversed.
This shit matters and is expected by people in established economies.  Bitcoin isn't threatening it at this stage nor does the community see a desire to because the consensus seems to be the "banking the unbanked" by giving them a digital mattress to put their money in is the future.
Beyond that Bitcoin is now more of a speculative investment then a currency anyway.  Big finance can find a way to make money off that.
@_date: 2019-08-21 02:46:59
Higher margins?
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:11:56
I think his reasoning is pretty spot on:
Roubini: Because this is neither a serious method of payment nor a good way to store capital. The bitcoin feeds on itself. There are no fundamental reasons for its price to reach such levels. What's more - it is also used by criminals, for their shady business. I think that more and more countries will start to make cryptocurrency exchanges illegal like China did. New regulations will be adopted. So, this will find its end.
It's a speculative bubble, certainly that's obvious if you've ever had an economics course.  That doesn't mean there isn't money to be made riding the wave of the next biggest sucker, you just need to know when to stop holding.
Right now is riding a wave being perpetuated by more folks getting in to get rich quick.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:07:20
But when this is fueled by investment speculation the end game for most of this influx of value is to exit at some point to fiat (USD) to reap the rewards.  It's hardly to stay in a volatile currency in order to try to actually spend it.  Bitcoin is a great casino right now and that's what's driving this ride.

Because it really had not reached the public mind share at that point, the ATH before 2015 was something you still had to be a real IT/tech geek to even know about.
Last year I was explaining to non-technical relatives why they shouldn't get into Bitcoin because it was being driven up like a bubble.   It was those non-technical folks who heard about it in the news, on social media, etc who got in and drove the price up hoping to get rich quick.  They didn't understand bitcoin, they didn't care about what it was, it was a lottery ticket to them.  Some folks I know got in, some are still holding hoping they'll be made whole again.  But those folks general attitude is "Oh man I was dumb and bought into the mania." 
But, that's the public's take away about Bitcoin now, it was a scam/a bubble/a ponsi scheme/tulip mania.  That's why you won't see them come back.  The resistance to repeating 2017 is tremendous now and every inch bitcoin loses increases the resistance to returning to any kind of ATH.
Blockchain may have some future, for now it seems it was a very buzzy techmeme in 2017 that is already losing a bit of it's gas, but it's likely not as a non-state distributed currency.  Bitcoin though looks like it's going to lose value until it reaches the point that it's remaining value is what it's always been - a black market currency for ransomware authors and selling illicit goods online.  That activity defines it's true global value, not the speculation. 
So, it's unlikely to ever go to zero, that activity and the remaining true believers/hodlers will keep it alive.  But the public has already soured on it.

So... it's exactly like Apple pay...
Only with a QR code scanner instead of NFC and the coffee prices will just swing 10-15% each day?
Not seeing the benefit.
Of course neither does Starbucks since they denied that they would be accepting bitcoin as part of whatever they are doing with Bakkt months ago. 
Apparently they're just going to offer some way to convert Bitcoin into dollars, which you can then use at Starbucks...
So the conversion is actually occurring BEFORE you purchase, rather than after.   Which is an improvement to the current retail situation since it takes the concern for price fluctuation out of the picture for the retailer.  They're still dealing solely in dollars.
@_date: 2018-11-21 02:07:53

But none of those are use cases for the typical average citizen in an modern industrialized nation.  Nobody worries about easily transporting money and having it confiscated, most average citizens have little need to move money much.  When they do it's large purchases like houses, which the money is easily moved with no fear of loss.
Going back to the example, a typical credit card user who pays in full each month BENEFITS from the middle man.  The middle man gives him a cut of the profit in the form of cash back, gives him spending protections, gives him other incentives, and for the average Joe makes spending easy.  There's no incentive for him to cut out this middle man and retailers that try to see sales suffer.
Anonymity of Bitcoin is highly overrated - "with caution" is an understatement.  To the point that it's largely a criminal reason anyone would put in that much effort.
The real benefit is possibly for retailers by shifting the costs from sellers to buyers for transactions, eliminating charge back, etc.   Buyers however have no reason to switch.   Buyers in fact have already moved away from that system (paper fiat) which had many of these features to one that doesn't (credit cards) because those features were not compelling to buyers.
And the buyers make the rules in a competitive market.
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:47:58
The folks believing that are delusional.  There is not a chance of that happening.  Nations will simply ban transactions in any currency but their own within their borders and/or collude together to do the same.   For example Europe and the United States would simply mandate all merchants only operate in dollars/euros.  It's not even a change most of the population would notice.
You won't kill bitcoin sure since there will always be a sub community using it.  But there is no way this will grow into a single global currency.
