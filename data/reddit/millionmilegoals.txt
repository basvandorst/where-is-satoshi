If you put every paycheck into bitcoin (which is a terrible idea) and spend your bitcoin for things you’re essentially converting it back to fiat. Would make more sense just to budget your money for things you’d need to pay for between paychecks.

Of course, I mean it’s one of the few assets that not only trades 24 hours a day but has huge volatility.

Roger was involved in bitcoin from its early days and really believed in it. He’s up there with a lot of the early adopters.
He is sincere in his belief that Bitcoin Cash fulfills Satoshi’s original vision for what bitcoin should be.
However he’s an idealistic who is failing to recognize that it doesn’t matter anymore. Bitcoin is taking on a life of its own as a “a store of value” is all about faith. Bitcoin will always have more faith as a store of value then other altcoins.
Bitcoin Cash is a better “currency” then bitcoin at this point but how many people are naive enough to think that at those stage in the game it matters? How many times do we shit on the guy who spent 10k btc on a pizza?

@_date: 2017-12-12 06:58:36
Nothing prevents the value of BTC form dropping when there are more sellers then buyers. Demand for bitcoin whether for speculation or as a store of wealth is higher then the supply right now which is driving up price. Sure, when prices stabilize speculators may not be as active and pull out but there should be ample demand from individuals who seek to use it as a store of wealth. Look at gold.
Mining is dilutive to the existing coins in circulation (about 16.7m) but there’s a maximum at 21m.  I believe currently only 1800 coins are mined each day which isn’t enough to keep up with demand and assuming miners immediately sell their coins.

You must be new to bitcoin. The price rise is pretty recent from March 2015 or so onwards. Before that it peaked at $1200 in 2013 and we were in a bearish market until spring of 2015 and found a bottom around $200-300.

Bitcoin is less and less a currency everyday and you can’t change that trend.
It’s apparent it’s more useful as a store of value with easy portability. There’s nothing wrong with that. You don’t need people to buy coffee with it. Buying real estate and Lambos is just fine.

It’ll never be a true currency because fees create too much friction in day to day transactions. It can be a store of value akin to gold but who knows what the value really is there.

If you want to listen to someone who has no idea what the fuck they are talking about. Watch this video.
GBTC trades at a huge premium to the value of bitcoin.
Each share represents around 0.09 bitcoins. That means if the ETF tracks underlying more accurately the price would be around 1100 (BTc currently at 12200). It closed today down $250 to $1574. That’s still a 40% premium over what bitcoin is currently trading at.
Bitcoins are more and more accessible everyday. It makes total sense people don’t want to pay a huge premium for exposure to bitcoin when they can just own the underlying. It’s not some goddamn Wall Street conspiracy, it’s common sense.

15% is a minor correction.

During the last financial crisis a lot of people lost their jobs and had to dip into whatever resources were available to them.
If the sample size I see here is any indication you’ll see a considerable dip in bitcoin prices in  the short term as people need to liquidate to pay for day to day expenses.
I wouldn’t expect btc to move up too much as times of financial crises are when smart money moves in to buy depressed assets at very attractive prices. If stocks and real estate are on sale that’s where money will flow to.
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:23:34
Not sure how they would make money in your example.
First, your ask and bid numbers are $0.99 apart. It’s irrelevant even if it was 0.01 apart.
They don’t charge fees on maker orders so they’d essentially be filling both the buy and sell order at exactly the prices the buyer and seller want. The limit orders have 0 fees. Coinbase would lose the amount of the spread.

After bitcoin dipped from its recent all time highs I bought up more at prices ranging from 3700-4200 with the intention of trading it out when the price got to this level.
I just sold everything I bought recently on this run. Got average price of ~4310.

@_date: 2017-08-24 23:14:14
My guess is as good as anyone's but I have enough experience investing in general to take your gains when they come. Volume doesn't seem to be too heavy with this rise in price. I also bought a lot more bitcoins then I would be comfortable holding long term.
I can now go back to relaxing and not checking the price every minute and just hold onto my original bitcoins.
I also wouldn't be surprised if it traded back down a bit. I'd probably buy back in a bit again.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:28:09

I meant by what I proposed all coins would be in circulation.
Satoshi initially wrote that but always knew that bitcoin would evolve over time. What he posted isn’t set in stone. Lost coins only benefit the value of other coins if we know they’re lost. We will never know what percentage of total supply is lost.

lol. I worked for one of the underwriters which was responsible for facebook’s ipo.
Facebook did have revenue, The issue was there was a quarter to quarter slide down which had people worried that growth was an issue. Calling it a bubble was a matter of opinion because tech was and still valued at a very high premium based on forward earnings.
It’s irrelevant to bitcoin because Facebook is a business. It’s categorized as a tech company but it’s pointless to compare it to bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a technology.
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:39:47
It’s essentially a bet that we are in the early adoption phase which means the value will move up exponentially before mass adoption.
Bitcoin is a high risk investment. I only have allocated towards it what I can afford to lose. 
Also, what’s stopping you from investing more because $60 is a meaningless amount to dip in. It could triple and still have no impact on your life.

They’re real profits to value the company which justifies the higher share prices when earnings grow. Companies that do well and grow earnings get justified higher share prices. Inverse for companies that don’t.
Those companies don’t pay dividends because they believe they can earn a higher rate of return reinvesting the profits back into the company to drive higher earnings.
The majority of S&amp;P 500 companies do pay dividends to their shareholders from their profits.

Just because your identity is verified doesn’t mean you qualify for instant purchases with a bank account right away. They’re rolling it out over time.
Unless you plan on trading it immediately it’s not a big deal. This has generally worked for everyone I’ve told to buy bitcoin. This guy bought in at 5800 and panicked at 5300 but his coins weren’t available to sell until it climbed over 6k and he calmed the fuck down.

See the part about year being flexible. It could be 100.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:14:15
Even if you believe bitcoin is going to 50k it’s always prudent to sell a little at every ATH because of the chance you could be wrong.
I have one more sale left to go and I’m really tempted to do it now. Then I’m down to my set it and forget it coins.
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:28:01
I don’t know if you’re trying to compare Facebook as a company to bitcoin but they’re two completely different things.
Facebook is a business that generates revenue off its user base very well. It’s value and growth potential and what investors are paying for it are rooted in what it’s expected to generate in earnings in future years.
Bitcoin is none of those things.

Mutual fund is just a vehicle. It can be a conservative fund or an aggressive fund. You’re most likely in a conservative mutual fund. Call them and ask for something that will offer you the best returns over the long term. They’ll most likely recommend an aggressive stock mutual fund.

Also BTC is not that easily transactable, yet. You’re limited in where you can use it and spend it at the moment. Even for people who do transact it, it seems based on the posts here enough people can’t figure out the transaction fees and why their transactions aren’t going through.

But we’re effectively saying that all coins are in circulation.
Right now the market considers satoshis coins to be dead and there’s talk that if they ever moved it would cause panic in the market.
If 21 million in circulation was always the constant number we’d have issues like what you proposed but it’d be less of surprise then assuming coins are dead then have them all just move one day.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:47:36
The problem is we don’t know what’s “lost” and what’s just inactive. If bitcoin is to last an eternity you’d figure all coins will eventually end up lost and we’d end up subdividing further and further what’s left.
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:15:30
Faith. It has more of it than other coins.

I said the time can vary. Would you still have issues if the time was 100 years of inactivity? Also, if you knew of the inactivity feature you can just do something once a decade or whatever easily.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:45:58
The problem is we don’t know what coins are lost or merely inactive. We’re only guessing because there hasn’t been activity in the wallet. It’s like we don’t know whether satoshi’s coins are lost forever or just biding time.
That’s why I said the years can be moved up. There’s no need for lost coins to be a feature of the system. It can be 100 years of inactivity and still be feasible.

I was setting auto buys into stuff like ethereum and litecoin. Then one day I realized I have no idea what current real world uses there are for ethereum besides speculation.

Can you explain how there would be more than 21 million coins ever in this scenario? Inactive coins would just be culled and released back to be re-mined. Total coins in ecosystem would be same except there wouldn’t be guessing as to whether a coin was lost forever or not.

You aren’t alone. Many people feel bitcoin is the answer to financial freedom which is why the demand is outpacing supply. As long as that trend continues the price will continue to keep rising.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:31:32
“Crash”. We haven’t seen a crash in quite some time. You realize it’s normal for BTC to correct a bit when it makes such a huge move up? It didn’t even drop that much compared to how much it moved up.

It could also be an incentive to keep mining once the last coin is issued. The difficulty adjustment could determine the rate at which lost coins are mined back.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:27:48
Wouldn’t hurt but wouldn’t do much for you either.
Even if bitcoin went 10x it wouldn’t be that meaningful an amount of money for you.
How about you cut down on other areas (drink cheaper beer) and regularly add to bitcoin.

The article makes no sense. What the fuck.
@_date: 2017-11-30 08:48:55
Total supply doesn’t change in this scenario. In fact we’re just guessing at total supply because we don’t know what’s lost for sure and may never know.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:39:27
Can we get a TLDR?
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:42:08
If you made the decision from an investment standpoint there’s nothing to be worried about.
Bitcoin is a risky asset. Whether it goes to 0 or 1 million doesn’t matter.
What matters is your allocation to risky assets. You should invest what you’re willing to lose and not care because it doesn’t affect your future lifestyle if it doesn’t pan out.

@_date: 2017-11-02 19:31:26
Moderately conservative is an interesting choice considering you have the risk tolerance for bitcoin and that is as aggressively risky as it gets.
Unless you’re much older it makes sense to be aggressive. See if they have any target date retirement options which will automatically shift you from aggressive to conservative over time as you get older so you can set it and forget it.

Start trading/owning bitcoin directly and stop dealing with these funds?
@_date: 2017-10-31 00:49:21
Wait, how is each contract denominated? How many bitcoins do they represent?
If they’re anything like commodities or stock contracts that’s more bitcoins than can trade.

20% if you're in the highest income tax bracket. It's 15% for most people.

What would bitcoin adoption have to do with government borrowing? They're still going to do it.

Read the article. It's was a home equity loan. 
Terminal illness is not typically a part of underwriting.

I "invest" in bitcoin but there are plenty of good reasons not to:
It's a very risky asset class.
They don't believe in the future of the technology.
They believe in the technology but believe the utility of bitcoin does not correlate to its current value.
If you're already comfortably wealthy there's no need to deviate from your current investments.
It's not an income generating investment.

What changes are you referring to and what about coinbase? Are you asking what coinbase is?
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:28:51
New to gambling eh?
@_date: 2017-10-10 16:47:14
Go use someone else then.

No. Usually pricing is similar to other exchanges which is why so many people are posting about this.
@_date: 2017-10-26 01:09:30
This seems like a reasonable progressive tax system. What’s the big deal?

Very cringeworthy thing to put on my car.

Why not? Where would you prefer they end up? Somewhere complex and daunting? Coinbase is easy.
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:06:43
They don't have to wipe all the ledgers. They can just make the punishment for using bitcoin very high. What happens if they declare it to be an instrument of terror financing and illegal for anyone to even hold it? That if you're found to be holding bitcoin you could be charged with conspiracy or worse?
Even law abiding citizens in other countries would avoid bitcoin because they don't want to end up on a list and be banned from traveling to countries unfriendly to bitcoin holders.
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:50:35
Bitcoin is not for developing countries that don't have reliable electricity and/or internet.

No, what does insurance have to do with BTC? You'd still need to protect your assets with insurance regardless.
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:23:16
At this point in BTC's lifecycle it would be much easier for them to declare bitcoin an illegal money laundering/terrorist financing instrument and stipulate they'll seize bitcoin assets if discovered and you'll see bitcoin collapse.
@_date: 2017-10-12 00:52:50
Who cares if it protects you with fiat money?
If I insure something for x amount of fiat because it takes x amount of fiat to replace in the event I need to as long as the insurance pays out x it doesn't matter that it's paid in fiat.

Don't you mean 21M?

This is not the personal finance sub but if you're responsible and living within your means it's a bare minimum you should have to cover personal emergencies, especially if you have a family. For a 30 year old working since 22 it only takes saving $1k a year or $19.23 a week.
@_date: 2017-10-18 00:57:25
The loan uses his house as collateral so he probably should if he wants the family to keep it.
@_date: 2017-10-19 05:18:45
Wow what. I thought we were just discussing theories here.
The doomsday scenario I'm actually worried about is a different one - a bitcoin epic crash. I'm already riding the rollercoaster up.
@_date: 2017-10-17 02:31:08
Low resistance way to get exposure in it with existing brokerage account channels. Premium doesn't matter to people who believe BTC is worth much more. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 13:35:17
Sure, but it's also worth it to examine your life as to why you only have $10 to put into bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:46:57
In that there's a lot of pro bitcoin coverage out there about bitcoin being the next big thing along with hitting all time highs and so forth.
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:57:40
I mean it'll still trade on coinbase/gdax so it's not like you'll have nothing.
@_date: 2017-10-05 20:59:57
Haven't noticed this sub attracts a lot of stupid people?

I think there will be a week delay or so in people getting their accounts up and funded.

Don’t worry about the 10k thing. That’s the only part of the advice that’s wrong.
10k is the reportable threshold for cash deposits at the bank and even then if the money was obtained legally there will be no issues.
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:13:50
Not if you are wealthy.
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:18:03
If you’re already comfortable using coinbase there’s no need to do anything. They said there will be support for the fork.
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:21:24
This is one of the scenario cash wins out. If people don't have electricity good luck trying to spend bitcoins to get anything.
@_date: 2017-10-12 01:21:11
Maybe for the naive ultra libertarians but there are advantages to fiat and it will have its place in the world. Governments will issue their own fiat currencies.
Also, an insurance contract could be denominated in BTC if all parties were interested in doing so. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 07:20:55
This. Bitcoin is not the answer to the majority of personal financial problems.
It's like the people on this sub who are looking to buy ~$50 of btc because that's all they can afford when they should analyze their life as to why they are in that situation (and fix it).
@_date: 2017-10-13 20:09:29
When fraudsters come and clean out your bitcoins out of your wallet the blockchain will come and replace them! 0% fraud liability!

I already assume the elite are the ones holding the majority of bitcoin and pushing the price up further.

Calm down there good will hunting.

Not sure where OP pulled the numbers form exactly but if the way you see it is true you really think they have bracket for $171-$290 (19500-33000)?
@_date: 2017-10-09 15:27:52
What should be done? They aren't exactly handing it out. The bills are needed for businesses to handle payroll which would normally be done by check/direct deposit and supply ATMs. Lots of transactions are being done in cash because electricity is so scarce.

Unless I’m looking at it wrong up to $180,000 in gains is taxed reasonably for Japan.
Chances are if you earned that money via working a job your tax rate would be much higher.
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:41:55
Both a store of value and a currency. Just because it can function as a currency doesn't mean it it has to replace fiat.
Fiat has its advantages.
Bitcoin has its advantages.

If you sold at any point $4k+ in the last month you made out pretty well getting back in at $3k to $3.8k
You don't have to be a day trader but moving in and out after all time highs can be pretty smart and profitable.
