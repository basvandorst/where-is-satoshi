Hold like gold 
Let this filter out some of the ignorant investors and those oblivious of bitcoins purpose and technology. Then reward those who are truly with it.
Eventually those involved who panick sell, trend buy etc, and those who fail to grasp digital currency to begin with- they shall catch on eventually and inevitably 
I ain’t tripping just regret sleeping through the 10k- got mine the night before

I’ll conclude your definition was false for the context and all practical purposes 
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:59:36
The technology? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:01:26
What about all the segwit wallets coming to play? Forget?
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:17:05
Then those Christmas spendings turn around to people with reinvesting (perhaps). Gamble my friends

But, bitcoin has definition to its value, with leverage by the people- us. Unlike say  the USD which is truly just fiat that we mutually agree on and give it value. 
Crypto is the future. As long as people aren’t cowardly- we can quit playing with monopoly papers and find a happy medium where both our gov and our people can cooperate.
I don’t see it a wise choice should they throw it under the bus- such would be blatant depriving of freedoms- and unless we want a society like North Korea, freedom fighters will struggle to maintain their perceived right to hold currency.

Hot air balloon, going places.

Bitcoin rises 20% in a day.. a month prior hit as low as a about 5k. Steam drops support, government as last publicly recognizes it and suggests to begin meddling wirh.. prices steadily grow. Seems like it’s damn near untouchable- stocks sure as hell don’t have this degree of leverage. 
So this bubble... what’s gonna pop it? I’ve had regrets for not investing more during all time highs, let alone for missing out to invest during routine crashes that seem less and less inevitable. 
Next thing you know, it’ll be 25k and a 23k crash would be huge opportunity.! I’m no fortune teller but lately this bubble is more so a  balloon. I still think it will pop eventually, but even as volatile as it has been, holders are realizing just how headstrong this currency is proving to be.

Cash out and buy presents. Lots people treat themselves too! 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:57:12
19700 a G in. Spaced Xmas cash ins and just figured now with steam dropping it, all the threats that should have caused crash resulted in just more growth, I opted in. Learned this time 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:12:18
Bought just below 20 thinking it would keep going, lol 
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:58:20
Christmas. Bch. Panic 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:26:53
Nov 11, 5500. And that wasn’t even before Christmas cashouts. People needa chill, simple 
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:15:41
Idk why I need to mention this.
1. BCH
2. Christmas cashoit
3. Tons people haven’t figured out segwit and the transfer fees seem atrocious
4. It rose like... from a 5.5k crash to over 20k in a lil over a month? Do you think that’s healthy and sustainable? 
Chill out those without economic perspective. You’re ok.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:00:27
Nope. Bitcoin is at last, YOUR money. It’s a threat to rhe fed reserve because these asssets aren’t just spawned fiat. Throw your BTC on a flash drive, lock it away- now it’s like gold rather than diamonds where you have a top to define and tell you what it’s worth. This is the people’s.
Depending on how large scale holding becomes, I do expect IRS getting involved. Unfortunately the sheep tend to get apprehensive without being herded. It’s indeed a threat - modern day tea party waiting to happen when we feel its our right to hold a currency, rather than fiat, And trade as we please. But I can see this as a blatant threat to the 1%ers and current model of economics.
I bank with Coinbase for much of this, no complaints- met in the middle, paying taxes and accountable for any profits I reap

So,, from what I understand this is secure to send/receive even when online laptop, granted the laptop is secure? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 03:51:05
4 hours Lensing for me so I’m also curious 
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:47:11
BTC is proven itself as a damned Phoenix indeed. I predict less rebound  crashes as us traders are learning, And as BTC is proving to be a concrete tower masquerading as if it’s something like Jennga��.
The bubble is a balloon, thicker than one would have thought. Quite an abomination.  
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:43:04
People aren’t investing this time. They are spending 
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:02:29
Let it fall over the weak til it’s more stable. Buy more then hold 
@_date: 2017-12-17 13:42:42
Dude I’ll buy in at all time highs now things have been, risk is low and never know when that all time high might overstay and keep growing way past
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:31:22
Indeed, that is a valid concern 
@_date: 2017-12-28 14:39:56
binance forum is just plagued with trouble reports. Gotta dig to find anything at least neutral. Not sure what the deal is, but it's kept me from exploring further
@_date: 2017-12-05 14:44:48
See, ditto. Waiting for a big dip then I grew tired of watching it steadily grow. 
I don’t think a big dip would happen again so easy now. Because, I think nov 11 is testimony that would deter anything drastic again.
Still fingers crosssed aye?

Reminds me of OBEY designs
