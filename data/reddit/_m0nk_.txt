Why is this article phrasing it as “exiting fiat” it is very easy to use both, I know we like to think of it as a replacement but in order for it to grow it will have to exist side by side with fiat for quite a time. Calling it exiting fiat at this point only drives people away

I guessed 6000 and people were downvoting me to shit. People think that 20k to 3k was an outlier but it really is par for the course. The people that don’t think it will fall hard again are crazy. And just because it falls hard doesn’t mean it won’t still grow to be of a much greater value

Why are you frustrated, Bitcoin came into the “mainstream” roughly in December of 2017 imo. It’s been 2 years. A changing of currency is something that takes decades if not more. It’s highly unrealistic to think bitcoin could come anywhere close to the same applicability as USD in this tiny timeframe.

Why, its gonna go down to at least 6000 at some point.

Its extremely volatile, it went all the way from 20000 to 3000, it most likely will fall hard again even if it does eventually reach a much greater value.

Question what happens when you overdraft bitcoin? Just thinking of reasons it would be better than a bank.

You violated the most important rule of investing, don’t invest more than you can afford to lose. Sadly there is nothing you can do, you do feel bad and you should feel bad, I mean if you felt good right now you wouldn’t be human. all you can do is learn from it.
