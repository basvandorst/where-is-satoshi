Ok I have read the mimblewimble white paper. I don't understand most of it, but I think I understood enough to appreciate how awesome it is.

I don't believe this is necessary in mimblewimble. You need only details of the coinbase transactions, and the UTXOs, nothing in between. 
But I could be wrong. I only found out about mimblewimble yesterday. 
@_date: 2016-08-25 05:55:40
I will read it for sure. Is a mimblewimble sidechain something that could be implemented now, or does bitcoin require upgrades first? If it does, do you know what time timeline for such upgrades is?

Buddy, the trick is (at least it seems so to me) is not to try and guess which horse you should back. Just invest in all the top ~10 coins. Get the same amount of each (as a proportion of total supply). You will end up with two thirds of your cash in bitcoin.
Then you are indifferent to whoever wins this race. It could well be bitcoin but don't bet the house on it. 
@_date: 2016-08-21 22:01:57
Are you saying that bitcoin SHOULD be the one global currency, or that it WILL be? It sounds like you are saying the second thing- sounds like wishful thinking to me? You can't predict the future. It could very well be a crypto that doesn't even exist yet that gets the  spot.

Thanks buddy! First time I've been tipped!
@_date: 2016-04-04 07:13:01
Why not use all those things as well? If there's a particularly strong altcoin then buy a bit more? If something appears to have no shelf life buy a bit less? But still, market cap should be the starting point.
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:08:29
Re AML etc, I guess because half the attraction of bitcoin is that it makes banks redundant so it rubs people the wrong way for bitcoin companies to have to follow the same rules banks do. Seen as a hangover from the old world.  Not saying that's a good reason. 
Re recovering stolen coins, 'immutability' is a big deal. The idea is that the code defines who owns what, you cannot have groups of people changing account balances, ever. Technically it is easy to reverse transactions but the community sees doing so as defeating the point of bitcoin. 
@_date: 2016-04-20 21:04:03

At the moment, yes, but it has been losing ground recently, relatively speaking, as a certain currency has been catching up. Who's to say it won't overtake bitcoin in terms of security in a few years?
@_date: 2016-08-24 21:18:12
There is a single sidechains whitepaper? I googled and came up with a blockstream one, is that what you are referring to?
@_date: 2016-04-28 21:12:00


I'm pretty sure that includes non currency wealth, like property, shares etc. Those things will still have value after fiat collapses. Bitcoin will never be $11m per coin (at today's prices). 
@_date: 2016-04-05 21:12:44
I'm in the same boat. Great wallet. I've also had a good experience with their API and customer support too. 
It's still somewhat unique in the bitcoin world as a 'hybrid' wallet, to my understanding, in that blockchain.info can not access my funds, unlike using a coinbase wallet etc.

Shouldn't it always be a multiple of ten minutes? Unless it takes into account an increased hash rate causing blocks to be found more than every 10 mins. But that doesn't seem likely here- 17 mins (presumably for 2 confirms) would mean average block time of 8.5 minutes which is very very quick. 
Is this block explorer making the noob error of thinking that as more time passes since the last block, the chances of finding a new block in the next X minutes goes up?

Sounds like we both actually agree we just started from different extremes. 
Certainly I could apply the above much better to my investments. I am just too lazy. 
Which of the top 10 altcoins do you think have real potential? Based on my understanding, the top 3 are ethereum, dash and monero. 
It is certainly true that if you follow a market cap only strategy you end up buying alts that are just at the peak of a hype/pump and then they quickly disappear again. Synereo entered the top 10 very recently after a HUGE surge. 
@_date: 2016-04-04 06:56:46
So what metric do you recommend using instead to work out if an altcoin is worth investing in? 
@_date: 2016-04-05 21:09:09
I see what you're saying. You're quite right. You can't retrieve the value of bitcoin by exchanging it for something else if you are trying to exchange a large enough quantity. But then this applies to most things I guess. 
@_date: 2016-04-09 20:57:28


No that's not why. Gold has value because it's scarce and it looks pretty. The intrinsic value is largely irrelevant.

That's not actually what futures tell you. They actually tell you very little. Took me a while to figure that out. If everyone thought bitcoin would be $50k in Jan the futures price would still be close to spot (although spot should be $50k in this instance!) 
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:52:14

It's worth paying $25 for a $10 item with bitcoin because it's more secure? 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:20:18
I agree, but bitpay (what the thread is about) is all about low value transactions not $5k transactions. Bitcoin is dead for everyday use as a currency, with or without segwit, until LN comes along.

he's talking shit. Litecoin is basically bitcoin with 4x blocksize. 
It does also have scrypt mining, but that is irrelevant from a scaling perspective. I wouldn't say it 'makes it better'. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:52:09
Bitpay is closed to the bitcoin market with current fees. The bitcoin cash market is larger than litecoin's. So it makes sense to do bitcoin cash first (or maybe ethereum) and then litecoin.

@_date: 2018-09-30 15:09:31


Right, but why is this necessary, bitcoin doesn't need to become a medium of exchange to become widely adopted, it just needs to be a store of value- which is achieved by people hodling it.

Are you 12 years old? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:22:36
For what it's worth, I support both bitcoin cash and LN. although I could be in the minority.
Also I believe bch is working on their own version of lightning that doesn't require segwit.
I also echo what that other guy said. We'll be effectively forced to use LN if the alternative is paying $50 fees for all but the largest of transactions. 
@_date: 2018-09-28 18:07:26
oh! What was it!?

If they are sold at auction, how can you do more for the 'same price'?  You don't choose the price. Just trying to understand...
@_date: 2015-12-15 22:06:41
My solution to this is to cash out 10% every time it goes up 10 times. It is brainless and prevents me trying to analyse the best time to sell which only causes regret and anxiety. 
It's very optimistic solution though- it needs to go up 100x before I make any 'profit'. But if I didn't think this was very plausible I wouldn't have invested in the first place.

Man I think we are lucky, those of us who only found out about it recently. Because there are SO many stories of early adopters losing their coins either in a hard drive wipe, they were goxed, or they just sold them. Having $1m and losing it is far worse than not having it at all.
We are late enough to take our coins seriously and hodl them offline, but still early enough to get a decent price. If moon really does happen, then $10k of coins today is more than enough to live on for the rest of your life.

I think those that have it worst of all though are ones that used to own btc but don't anymore- they either sold it, lost their private key, or lost it to a hack. Can you imagine how someone who owned 6,000 coins but lost them all at mt gox will feel when btc goes to the moon? That would be so devastating.

Would you say that a deflationary currency like bitcoin would be good if adopted globally- or, we will have to just wait and see?

It seems to me that there is not enough historical precedent to accurately predict how things would be if bitcoin became globally adopted.

The thing I personally wish more people understood is the difference between an increase in the money supply (what inflation actually is) and the increase in price of an arbitrary basked of goods (what all inflation statistics refer to).

If I lend a friend $100, and he gives me $1 back, I can then use that $1 to buy something while the debt has gone down to $99?
I guess this relates to the idea that money is destroyed when used to pay back debt. Which is what Mike Maloney says in his Hidden Secrets of Money series. But I don't follow this. Money isn't destroyed when a debt is paid back, but the debt is.

That is a good point, I didn't think about that. On the off chance that a totalitarian government gets in power, it would be much harder for them to do their evil things if bitcoin is the prevalent currency.

That isn't the argument against cloud mining though. The argument against cloud mining is that if you would get more bitcoins from the mining than the cost of the mining, the owner of the hardware would just do that and not offer it to you at that price. Given they are offering it, it implies that you must lose money. 
And this argument also applies to mining hardware...

@_date: 2015-01-14 12:20:48
Tech goods are a well documented exception to how an inflationary society often works. Besides, often with tech goods they are not getting cheaper at the speed they seem to. Instead of comparing the price of a computer with a specific performance bought five years ago and bought today (probably a 10x decrease in price) you should compare a top of the range computer five years ago with a top of the range computer now (very similar prices).
Anyway, regardless of deflation in tech, my point still stands. Are you saying that deflation is not bad for an economy? Is that your argument?
@_date: 2015-01-11 17:43:07

Other commentators are saying this isn't necessarily true? I think it's important to understand this bit completely!


I did not know this! So nodes and mining are completely independent? This sounds like a potential problem- without any true incentive to run nodes, the number could decrease, threatening the entire network?
@_date: 2015-01-11 13:27:46
Thanks so much buddy! I hope you don't mind if I ask a load of follow up questions!
2) How can I resolve this? If I 'move my private key offline' is it too late- because blockchain already has access to it?
3) How do you know blockchain encrypted my private key? Is it possible that they don't encrypt it, i.e. they don't need my password to show me the contents of my wallet? 
New question:
9) Where is the amount of coins assigned to each address 'stored'?
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:26:07
Yes, I agree that deflation rewards people who store value, but I wouldnt say its a good thing. By the same token it hurts people who are in debt. Arguably a deflationary currency will result in making the rich richer and the poor poorer, surely?
Regardless, the primary reason a deflationary currency is bad for an economy is because it causes people to delay purchases, reducing domestic demand and hurting the economy. Surely this is a negative state of affairs, which would be the inevitable result if bitcoin became our primary currency? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:36:44


I think it can happen, and already does, with a central bank who is tasked with changing interest rates to keep value steady (or very low inflation). Although I agree, in a decentralised system I'm not sure how this is possible.

Oh, I didn't actually know that. Are hardware wallets built in such a way that they can sign transactions on an online computer, but it is impossible for a hacker with full access to that computer to steal the private key? I would have thought that was impossible.
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:37:45
Wait! I think I just figured out, the 'list of what addresses own how many bitcoins' = the blockchain itself? Am I right? If so, do you need to read the ENTIRE transaction history of an address from the block chain to arrive at the current balance?
Also, the white paper says 'A block header with no transactions would be about 80 bytes. If we suppose blocks are
generated every 10 minutes, 80 bytes * 6 * 24 * 365 = 4.2MB per year. With computer systems
typically selling with 2GB of RAM as of 2008, and Moore's Law predicting current growth of
1.2GB per year, storage should not be a problem even if the block headers must be kept in
This makes no sense to me, as he is ignoring the transactions themselves from his calculations?
@_date: 2015-01-27 08:08:50


But fiat will start to devalue if a crypto coin becomes popular enough. Then it will be no problem to pay taxes in fiat as it will be cheap. 
Furthermore, I think you need to consider DAO- digital autonomous organisations, 'bitcoin 2.0'. These are completely decentralized organisations which at the front end appear the same as ebay, paypal, spotify, whatever we currently have. The problem is that as they are decentralised, how does the government tax them? who do they send the bill too? Taxation will not be possible like it is now. The government's power to influence the future of crypto will drop as crypto's spread grows.
@_date: 2015-01-14 15:01:16


This seems fine to me- there must be punishments to not paying tax or no one would pay it? Are you suggesting that a post-fiat currency world will have no tax?

I think people are missing an important point which is that the current cause of growing wealth inequality (the new $ from fractional reserve lending goes primarily to people with exposure to houses or financial assets = rich) cannot occur with bit coin as fractional reserve lending is impossible.

Potentially it would also mean the end of fiat currencies as you could 'steal' infinite amounts of cash from banks etc if you got through their crypto. So it seems that the argument that 'crypto may be broken' is lessened, because if it is, then we're all screwed, not just bitcoin owners? Does that make sense?
@_date: 2015-01-11 18:02:33

This video is absolutely fantastic, exactly what I was looking for. Thanks!
@_date: 2015-05-09 23:00:30
I disagree buddy and here is why. 
One of (possibly the biggest) reasons why wealth inequality is getting worse is that newly printed fiat makes its way to the rich first (this is obviously a simplification but a fair one). Rich people tend to spend money more on financial assets (shares) and houses than the rest of society. As a result, the prices of financial assets and houses goes up faster than other goods/services. 
Since the rich disproportionally own houses and financial assets, they benefit from the increase in prices of these assets, causing them to become richer over time relative to the rest of the population.
With bitcoin, money creation works in a completely different way and eventually will stop entirely. Therefore, although bitcoin may start with a lot of inequality, it is not likely to get worse over time as it does with fiat.

@_date: 2015-01-26 17:05:06
Haha true. It seems likely to me that at some point in the future, as cryptocoins (hopefully bitcoin mainly ofc) become more and more used throughout the world, the fiat currencies will start to devalue- that will be such a historic event. People will withdraw their cash from banks in order to buy bitcoins. The banks won't have enough cash to fund the withdrawals, so they will start going bankrupt. But unlike 2008, the government CANT bail them out as their fiat currencies aren't worth anything anymore, and they can't print bitcoins. 
Once it starts, this vicious circle will result in an utterly transformed society. I am fairly certain that this will happen. The only question is when, and with what coin.

But we DO know how to prevent centralisation of mining: require a variety of proof of work which can only be performed using a processor which performs a variety of functions (i.e. A desktop cpu). Therefore ASICS won't be possible. Furthermore, mix in proof of memory, now you need some ram as well as a desktop cpu. Desktop pcs will never be redundant under these conditions allowing many more people to mine, reducing centralisation. (this does not deal with the problem of pooling however!)

I don't think this would work. For banks to use the coins as collateral they would need to see evidence that the guy asking for a loan actually owns the coins. Which would require a transaction from the address (even for a dust amount).

I find you confusing. In your other post you came across like an uneducated redneck who believes everything they hear on fox news. Yet this post is much more articulate, nuanced, and sensible. Do you suffer from multiple personality disorder?
I agree that one of the best things about bitcoin is that it makes wars harder to finance (because issuing debt is much harder) which is definitely a good thing. However, from my understanding, this is due to the technical way bitcoin works and has almost nothing to do with it being a deflationary currency. Bitcoin could be an inflationary currency and still limit a country's ability to borrow to fight wars.
However I still disagree with you on your other points. I strongly disagree with your idea that there is anything 'silly' or 'irrational' or 'useless' about buying things we don't *need*. I agree that a deflationary currency probably would decrease such industries, and the economy as a while along with it. And this is a very bad thing. It's the stuff we don't need to do/buy that make life worth living.
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:39:03


Are you saying that this is a good thing, that a deflationary currency would hurt governments and large corporations? 


What about members of society who are in debt? It would be terrible for them. Poor people are more likely to be in debt than rich people, so surely a deflationary currency would *help* the 1% and hinder the 99%?

I agree 100% op. It is so strange how cheap bitcoins are. They feel like buying winning lottery tickets. I have raved about them to loads of my friends yet they aren't interested.
I currently can't decide whether to rub it in their faces or not when bitcoin goes to the moon. Should I be all 'if you listened to me you would be able to retire right now' or be more sympathetic? 
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:02:29
As far as I understand, deflation is a bad thing because the prices of goods all decrease over time, thus incentivising people to buy later instead of now, which decreases demand for goods, which causes the price to drop even lower, setting off a deflationary spiral. 
What has the level of government debt got to do with this? And surely this is WORSE if the currency is NOT an inflationary one as it's much harder to solve?

@_date: 2017-03-20 22:03:32
I'm very concerned that BU could get to 75% hash rate and you still (unless I misunderstand) wouldn't support a core HF? 
What if Core supported 8MB + segwit and 90% of people supported it, how would this be contentious? Because of the 10% who didn't?


Do you not worry that in this instance you/we will lose the branding war, because the BU chain will become the new bitcoin on exchanges, and the minority chain will be given something else, like bitcoin core chain or something like that?


How so?


Perhaps it only appears this way because the vast majority of users support the ethereum foundation? I mean miners/users are not forced to go along with what they say. 


For sure, but it looks to be solving those technical challenges unlike bitcoin. For example, ethereum will almost certainly have 2nd layer payments before bitcoin.

a) generate a new 12 word seed
b) turn this into a master private key
c) generate X child private keys
d) turn all X child private keys into public keys
e) Sha256 all of these public keys to get the address
f) query a block explorer to find out of these addresses have a balance

Core deserve the blame for this for being so stubborn. If they had even 2MB hard fork we'd already have segwit by now and BU wouldn't exist.

Sure thing. 
Roger Ver discovered bitcoin in 2011. He was a millionaire by this time due to the success of Memory Dealers. He also immediately saw and understood the potential of bitcoin. 
It is inconceivable that any millionaires who grasped the potential of bitcoin in 2011 wouldn't have bought a huge stash. 
Ever since 2011 his life has been bitcoin, bitcoin, bitcoin. He has invested in multiple startups (thus demonstrating both that he was a millionaire and that he saw the potential of bitcoin). He is constantly attending bitcoin seminars/conferences/meetups. 
For you to believe what you believe, you have to provide some evidence that Roger has suddenly stopped believing in bitcoin and has sold his stash. I look forward to it. 
I met Roger a few months ago at a London bitcoin conference. He gave a presentation about how great bitcoin is. Why would he do this if he's sold all his stash?

Also, what if a minority of BU users decide that 8MB is the largest it should be for the forseeable future and set EB = 8 and AD = 100000.
If they have 40% hashing power and the other 60% supports greater than 8MB, there will be a fork. But what if six months later the &lt; 8MB chain grows and one day has a higher cumulative POW. Then BAM, thousands of blocks are discarded on the &gt; 8MB chain. 
It is very similar to the current dispute between core chain causing a huge reorg if it is originally minority chain but grows to be majority chain. 
This is difficult for me because I am a big blocker, I think Core are being stubborn idiots, I just don't see BU as the way to do it...why not just use the same adaptive block size ethereum uses?

Please could you go into more detail. Why is it normally 2^132, where does this number come from? My understanding is that private key is 256 bits so so why not 2^256? Is there less 'entropy' with a seed than this for some reason, if so why? And 66 isn't half of 132? So many questions!
However, if the SHA1 collision required 2^63 sounds like I'm safe? I mean they put a lot of resources behind that collision. Being three orders of magnitude safer sounds pretty good!

In order to destroy bitcoin? Similar to a 51% attack but requires less hash power and is much more likely to cause huge havoc.

I would be interested to read about an objection to LN which is that it may be difficult to close a channel if the blocks are full. This would be a particular problem if the counter party broadcasts an obsolete transaction and you are unable to broadcast the most recent one before the time out. What if a well used LN node cheats on all its counterparties at once, will all of them be able to dispute this before timeout with a 1mb block?

I agree that market adoption isn't required for bitcoin to massively succeed. People who keep asking what shops accept it are missing the point. 
But, if merchant adoption takes off with another crypto, it is plausible that the 'store of value' crown could move to that coin's head, leaving bitcoin with nothing. 
It looks increasingly likely to me that bitcoin will never scale so we better hope it remains  in store of value. I think...that it will but is anyone's guess really. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 09:45:24
The problem is that 'the market' won't share your objections to scaling, in my opinion. Even if scaling compromises trust in security and stability to people like yourself, the average market participant will notice the market adoption of another coin and see 'the writing on the wall' and move their store of value over. 
I think. Of course we dont know. Out of interest, are you so confident that bitcoin will maintain its role of digital gold that you don't think it is necessary to diversify into other crypto? Or do you own alts?

Over the past 80 years they have just gone back and forth. Neither has consistently outperformed the other. This would at least support my original point that if something goes up in value something else goes down and vice versa, although I'm not sure how to reconcile this with the housebuilding example.

Text: 
A couple of weeks ago bitcoin, the decentralised cryptocurrency, experienced a splintering event in a bid to address its network capacity constraints. The event saw a rival version of Bitcoin spawned, now known as Bitcoin Cash, which is capable of handling many more transactions per minute than the original version of bitcoin.As of Monday, Bitcoin Cash was worth a collective $5bn or so on the market. (See latest prices by way of the Kraken market:)
Unusually, rather than skim that value from the original currency — in a way that efficient market hypothesis would have predicted — the splintering led to an explosion in the price of the original. On Monday, to the delight of Bitcoiners everywhere, Bitcoin ‘originals’ were fetching in excess of $4200 per coin, a price rise of more than 28 per cent on the week.
At this point, what serious investors would want to know is just how realisable these prices are in practice.
And here’s the thing.
It’s one thing to put a price on a fantasy asset and trade it within a close-nit community which believes all their fantasy assets are equally valuable. It’s an entirely different thing to see it hold that value in the real world.
Take as an example an artist who decides a sculpture he has made is worth $1m. If he can only trade it for another sculpture by another artist who also decides his sculpture is worth $1m, does that really prove it’s worth $1m? Probably not. It just implies two artists are living in a fantasy world where they collectively think they can generate millions of dollars of value by moulding some material and swapping it with each other in perpetuity. It also implies they don’t currently have much need for anything else in their lives (they’re either already comfortably well off, or sacrificing consumption for the sake of acquiring the one piece of art — which may be by another artist other than themselves — that will one day be wildly demanded by the conventional market).
While it’s true that real-world trading against fiat currencies goes on in bitcoin, the Initial Coin Offering (ICO) frenzy has seen this pale into insignificance compared to trading against “alternative” cryptocurrency coins, where self-dictated valuations rule the roost. This, it should be obvious, is not a stable underpinning for any price explosion.
In a recent piece in Bloomberg, Tyler Cowen rightly noted altcoin trading is detracting from cryptocurrency’s role as a medium of exchange, moving it more strongly into the category of store of value.*
In that role, he added, altcoins are more useful as effective hedges against either other cryptocurrencies or conventional assets.
This may well be true.
Even in our artist analogy, there is logic in swapping and diversifying one artist’s creations for those of other artists on the basis that it’s unlikely that all the artists — in what is an extremely low barrier to entry profession — will emerge as break-out stars capable of commanding megabucks in their limited production lifetimes.
From a utility point of view, Cowen adds, alt currencies also provide the market with new and improved money laundering tools, which, whether you like it or not are a real-world use.
This also ties in with the art market analogy, since art market valuations have always been intimately tied to the asset’s role in money laundering, something which — as forgeries have become easier to detect and sniff out, ensuring the limited status of master originals — has indirectly led to increased demand for new artists. Who needs a Gauguin, when you can leverage the artist promotion and dealing network to drive hype and momentum around a new artist who may one day be even bigger than Gaugin?
In that sense altcoins really are the “modern art” to bitcoin’s limited “master” edition. The cryptocurrency market as a whole, meanwhile, is no more and no less than the ultimate expression of a luxury cult market.
Some might say the fad has at least allowed for some limited wealth distribution to speculators, miners and architects (artists) in play. Even so, we’d argue it’s unlikely to have offset the wealth being consolidated in the hands of those who earned it illicitly, without merit or by playing outside of the rulebooks set in our societies. More importantly still, none of the above distribution would have actually created new wealth from scratch as much as shifted bits of existing wealth around, or at best allowed illicit wealth to be recognised as legitimate (if you view that sort of thing as desirable).
But true value still underpins the art market.
Of course, whatever the art market is, it is not immaterial or undesirable. Thus, even if it’s underpinned by only a handful of overly affluent and obsessive collectors who are prepared to bid against each other to ridiculous degrees, there is some logic in the competition if the outcome sees them acquire iconic cultural works which can be displayed, marveled at or protected for future generations.
That this market is totally detached from the comprehension levels of normal people, who would never waste real-world resources on such frivolous things, is mostly irrelevant. The common man can still identify with or appreciate the work aesthetically or from a historical point of view from afar or in a museum. The rich in this way, even if inadvertently, end up assigning their wealth to the relatively useful purpose of cultural preservation.
If altcoin and cryptocurrency valuations are to be sustained longterm, they clearly need to draw on a similar resource of obsessive collectors.
But herein lies the Achilles heel of the altcoin market. Unlike the art market, you don’t need to own a bitcoin or an altcoin to “appreciate” its coding or its makeup. There is no observational “experience” to be had. You can take it, leave it or move to another one more cheaply.
If the rich are ever to scour the globe to get their hands on the last remaining altcoin in a specific issue we can be sure it won’t be for cultural preservation purposes. It will be entirely for emperor’s new clothes purposes — a.k.a a fantasy vanity game that’s going on mostly in their own heads.
The hunt to attach real value to altcoins
Small wonder, in that context, altcoin developers are now desperately trying to attach real value to altcoins with concepts such as “only the ownership of this coin will entitle you to x good or service”. This, however, is economic madness since it requires producers of real wealth to purposefully restrict sales opportunities — a form of collusion or monopoly — to those bearing their specific coins only. Not only is this discriminatory, gouge-y and economically inefficient, it can’t work unless the limited issuance of coins keeps coming back into circulation post public redemption of goods. Yet this can only happen if the producer keeps reselling those coins to the market at a gouge-y premium — most probably for assets it values more than its own coins (presumably those with greater liquidity and acceptance).
That, in turn, can only be sustained if the market believes the underlying services or goods being are uniquely that valuable. If they’re not — or, alternatively, if they’re more widely available at a cheaper rate, against currency they already have — they’ll just go elsewhere. More to the point, if they have to use more useful currency to purchase single-purpose currency from the seller at a premium just to get their hands on the service or good, they’ll soon realise this is no different to the seller simply overcharging them versus to other vendors in the market. It’s not clever, at best, it’s just price obfuscation.
If markets really are efficient, these factors will in time see altcoins undermine the only chance cryptocurrency ever had to supersede the fiat system, which was in everyone joining up — tower of babel style — to the singular bitcoin network.

Also some of us don't like knowing what the price is all the time. 
It is well established that an X% rise in your portfolio doesn't feel quite as good as a X% fall feels bad. The more often you check the price, the closer it is to a 50% chance of a gain, 50% chance of a loss. At these odds it is- on average- bad for your mental health to check the price.

@_date: 2017-01-09 21:53:13


Bingo. The reason actual inflation (i.e. of the money supply) is far higher than reported inflation is because reported inflation measures the price rise of an arbitrary basket of goods. And this basket does NOT include financial assets  (so the S+P) or the other main asset that goes up in value faster then everything else, houses. 
Without inflation in the money supply, how can the S+P keep going up? It can't. 
Something very important I only learnt recently, which is that although the *price* of many things goes up over time, the *value* does not. It is impossible for everything to go up in value at the same time. Something going up in value necessarily means other things are going down in value. 
Try calculating the gains of the S+P over the past half century in gold or oil instead of USD.

Do you think there is a size below which the majority of people would not prefer light wallets? I can't see that there is. Why would the average user choose to download the blockchain when they could just not download the blockchain, regardless of whether the blockchain is 80GB or 80MB?


If it was considered acceptable how is it a compromise?

@_date: 2016-11-24 09:07:59




It's just a matter of perspective. Bitcoin has had gradually increasing block size for almost 8 years up until six months ago. I.e. the dominant (only) chain has had increasing block size with on-chain scaling since 2009. The 'change' is that block size suddenly stopped increasing. 


No that doesn't make sense. You are saying that 2MB is bad because it's arbitrary, but 1MB isn't bad despite being equally arbitrary? 


Please cite where I mentioned that 1MB was wrong when it was introduced. I don't remember saying that. As for science, here we go:

Tell me more about this pls? Sounds interesting.


Yeah me too. I'm extremely excited about LN. Could be so incredible! I imagine it would be like this, please let me know if I'm wrong: major merchants like purse.io, overstock, bitpay itself (and all the merchants they work with) will have their own payment channels with all major online hot wallets. So if I have btc in one of these wallets, I will be able to buy stuff from these merchants without an on chain transaction. It'll probably be a lot longer before I can do so with my own wallets though. Does that sound about right? 


I guess because off chain scaling relies on some on chain scaling to work. For example, you need an on chain transaction to open a LN channel.

Well I agree with all of that I think. 
I'm not really sure what your point is though, or where you are disagreeing with me? 
You are inserting the middle man of people to give something that has intrinsic properties market value. I'm just skipping out that middle man although of course it exists. Without conscious creatures nothing has value. We are both saying the same thing from a different perspective I think. 
Unless you are saying that because of this middle man, nothing has intrinsic value, in which case you are just defining intrinsic value differently to me. And I would argue incorrectly, as per the wikipedia definition I mentioned earlier. Maybe a better term for what you are describing would be 'absolute value'.

That analysis was flawed. It was calculating the price rise of the 'first ever' price of a coin compared to its current price. 
You cannot do this for two reasons. For a start, some coins have an ICO, some are mined from zero so you are not comparing like with like. Secondly, bitcoin originally had zero value so he can just choose when to start bitcoin's price at.

This is actually a good point. It is very plausible that in a year or two, the mainstream media will have articles discussing the possibility of a $1m coin.

@_date: 2016-11-26 00:33:48
I don't believe the 92bn fix was a hard fork. A hard fork is defined as expanding the set of possible blocks/transactions, a soft fork reduces the set of possible blocks/transactions. Re. the 92bn the possible set of transactions was reduced (i.e. to no longer accept overflowing variables). 
But I could be wrong. I am very often wrong. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 23:39:57

I understand the confusion with blockchain.info but 'coinbase' is a much more irrelevant term within bitcoin. I would have thought that people who dig deep enough to learn what a coinbase transaction would be beyond any confusion about there also being an exchange by the same name! But maybe not. 
Btw I just did a ctrl+f of 'coinbase' in the whitepaper and it isn't there, do you know what the origin of the word is?
@_date: 2016-11-25 23:58:16
Well this is also the logic Core are using. Both parties are guilty of the same thing. 
@_date: 2016-11-25 06:57:35
Of course we need other layers. It is for sure the only way to successfully scale as much as we need to. There is absolutely a block size above which centralisation is threatened. Probably much lower than 384mb.
BUT none of that means we can't scale on chain as well. You did not point to a source which demonstrated how 2mb would threaten centralisation. And even if you had done it wouldn't matter. Would it still have been true in a year, when we have faster Internet, cheaper hard drives? What about five years? The block size at which decentralisation is threatened is constantly increasing. So why can't the block size itself be constantly increasing as well? 
@_date: 2016-11-26 00:12:16
True but the cat would be out of the bag by then wouldn't you say?

I repeat, how are they meant to get data suggesting tax evasion from a specific person without doing exactly what they're doing!? 
It isn't different from them asking for all of BoA records. What's wrong with them asking for this? Actually I kind of assumed they already did? I would agree that it isn't right for them to only ask for this data for bitcoin users and not fiat users. 
Again  you are repeating this cloud of suspicion thing. I will roll with it this time. So- what's wrong with the notion of the tax authority being suspicious of everyone by default that they aren't paying the right taxes? Seems reasonable to assume that many many people- perhaps most- would avoid paying taxes if they thought they could get away with it. So a tax authority that isn't suspicious of everyone is just opening the doors to tax evasion. Exactly who are the kind of people who they shouldn't be suspicious of, they should just assume are paying the right taxes without checking? And do you really, really think bitcoin users are in this group!? Maybe the IRS reads these comments! I cannot think of a group they should be more suspicious of! 
As to your final point- are you aware that the richer someone is, the more likely it is they their income comes from capital gains? So removing this tax is perhaps the single worst thing you can do regarding wealth inequality, which is already terrible? Do you not think that wealth inequality is a problem? 
Regardless, what taxes should they increase to make up the lost tax on removing capital gains in your opinion?

Could someone help me understand something else about BU. Wouldn't it make 51% attacks much, much worse? 
Let's say (hypothetically) that China took over all its mining operations, that stood at 75% of global hash rate. They then increased block size as much as they could get away with under BU. They increased it so much that you would need a 1Gb connection to run a full node. Decentralisation is completely destroyed as 99% of full nodes have to switch off. 
Is this plausible? How high could the block size be increased to if you had 75% hash rate?

It could happen in many ways. 1) The creator gets greedy because he only kept a million of the 21 million 2) The creator is found and is forced to hand over the code for the new person or country to exploit the code 3) A bug messes the code and all the money goes poof. 4) I hack into the code and sell 10 million more because want to be a billionaire 5) Bitcoins get too expensive and only criminals and governments hold them. At today’s rate of $1000 and only $21 million out there, it is a matter of time that a few governments buy them all out.
And then of course the person who created them has not paid taxes on the business income. That is jail time and imagine it is an Indian that gets caught by Modi who uses it to make money or crash the system.
Paper money is backed by a government. Even the countries recalling the paper pay for it unless of course the holders received it and hold it illegally. Too bad for those holding it illegally. And too bad for the bitcoin guys when that code gets cracked.
Modi could pass a law that requires all Indians to declare bitcoins held in their tax returns or a miniimu10 year jail term. That could be painful when caught. There are many ways to setup a person with bitcoins."

I was referring to the block size of the block less witness data which is still at 1MB after segwit unless I do not understand it correctly.

Honest question- why shouldn't he have been taxed on it? Otherwise everyone can use the same technique to avoid inheritance tax by 'hiding' stuff in their homes?
Even if you disagree about having an inheritance tax in the first place (if so, am interested to hear why), surely you can't think it's fair to apply it to some people and not others?
@_date: 2016-12-26 00:21:48
I know it's fashionable to say it could go to zero tomorrow (like it makes it easier to get away with very bullish predictions) but really, can it? What even remotely plausible series of events could cause bitcoin to go to zero in one day? 
The only thing I can think of is if sha256 is completely 100% broken. Based on my understanding, this does not fall under the heading of 'remotely plausible'. However if I'm wrong I would love to know about it. 
@_date: 2016-11-12 19:57:21
No he's not talking about bitcoin 
@_date: 2016-11-27 23:02:42


Yes? 
I can easily imagine bitcoin growing to 10% the size of the USD economy which would make it a $1trn cap, 100x higher than it is now. 
@_date: 2016-11-26 00:25:24
Maybe a dumb question...but why are they all leaving? Would love an explanation!

@_date: 2016-12-29 23:03:05
Just so I understand- your argument is "some of the things the government spends taxes on are a waste or wrong, therefore nobody should pay any tax at all"? 
@_date: 2016-11-28 22:43:23
How much of what you just said is also valid criticism against BU?

Because some people who die have more money than other people who die. 
Next question please.

Yes, except to the extent that intrinsic value gives something a market value. But that is the relationship, one way from intrinsic value to market value. As opposed to other forms of value such as gold/bitcoin being a good store of wealth because it has high market value. 


No, as above. It is the component of market value that would still exist if something was valued entirely at its intrinsic value. So, the value of gold if it was used only in industry, and not as a store of wealth or jewellery. Which is probably about ~10% of its current market value (based on the fact that 10% of gold is currently used in industry). 




Why not, if something's natural properties cause it to have market value?


Of course. The specific monetary value society puts on something's intrinsic properties is subjective. 


Generally I would say this is true. There are exceptions for when something has such a large supply that its value is zero despite being very useful (i.e. it would have high intrinsic and thus market value if it was scarce) such as air. 
But I would agree that if something has zero market value then it also has zero intrinsic value.

Many, many people are convinced that Core have zero intentions of ever doing a HF to 2MB. Given this, wouldn't it make sense to lump in the 2MB with segwit at the same time? To prove them all wrong?
@_date: 2016-12-29 22:32:18
You seem to think this is coinbase's fault? 
@_date: 2016-11-23 22:52:07
Do you have any evidence of any of that or did you just make it up?
I cannot believe this shit gets upvoted here. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 23:03:56
What's wrong with coinbase? It's a brilliant name. 
@_date: 2016-11-02 21:52:48
Yes I love this idea- I think it's called hyperbitcoinization. 
The idea is that 90% of people who end up using bitcoin in the future, don't do so because they choose to or think it's cool, but because they are forced to by the collapse of their own currencies. Seems very plausible to me. 
@_date: 2016-12-03 20:52:15


Maybe the guy knew all along that he would be hit by IT and went through with it anyway as he thinks it's wrong to not pay your fair share of taxes?

@_date: 2016-12-04 19:32:26


Again not sure what your point is. Are you saying that sometimes it is hard to value an asset for inheritance tax purposes, therefore we should scrap inheritance tax completely, even for assets that are easy to value like gold?

@_date: 2016-11-26 15:54:07
Well I can't disagree with that. I do wish r/btc and co would focus on things like 2,4,8MB and not giving control of size over to miners. 
It would make a 51% attack much much worse if in addition to controlling which transactions get mined you could also change the block size. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 19:47:52

Yes when I said they print money I didn't mean literally! 
I wasn't aware there exists physical currency for central bank reserves? Are you sure about this? I was told it was entirely digital? Central banks do print physical cash of course, but it's not central bank reserves they are printing but actual cash that can be used in shops etc. This is then exchanged with banks in return for their reserves.

@_date: 2015-07-14 11:39:58
Here's a question for you. Central bank reserves have increased substantially since the 2008 crisis, but money supply hasn't- I believe because there havn't been enough credit worthy customers to lend to, so even though banks are 'allowed' to loan out a lot more they have not. But what's stopping a bank 'cashing out' their huge reserves in actual cash and causing an increase in the money supply this way?

Hmmm 'certain' sounds a bit strong? I agree it is far far less than 1m people though (obviously).
Which is REALLY weird to me. Bitcoin has such huge potential...yet so few have any real investment in it. Even the vast majority of bitcointalk users have &lt; 1btc (from a poll, off the top of my head). I can't explain it.

@_date: 2016-02-03 19:35:59
Maybe you are right buddy. After all we're not generally rational creatures. It makes sense to me that people could be aware of the potential of bitcoin but not buy any due to a kind of 'head in the sand' mindset. Perhaps they missed a previous pump and are suffering with cognitive dissonance, causing them to magnify any negative bitcoin news and shrink the positive. 
I'm from the UK and have absolutely noticed how the exchanges are struggling to get bank accounts. Both Coinbase and Cryptopay used to have a UK account, but now neither of them do. I originally used an exchange 'speedybitcoins' but they lost their account too, and they don't even exist anymore. The only exchange that I know of that has a UK account is Uphold. 
What is your involved with all this, how do you know so much about it?Do you believe the reason exchanges keep getting their account shut down is genuinely because on some level the banks feel threatened?

The thing about this is that bitcoin already has the one characteristic which makes gold such a good store of value- scarcity. Fiat needs to be backed by something like gold because it has no scarcity. Bitcoin doesn't, it's already scarce. I'm not sure 'backing' it with gold adds any value at all.

Your mistake is thinking that banks are single, conscious entities. They are not. They are just a bunch of people, the vast majority of whom don't care about bitcoin. 
Furthermore, I can't imagine there is even a single banker who is more concerned with their employer's profits than their own. Any banker who genuinely believes bitcoin is a threat to banks would just jump the fence and buy bitcoins.

I don't understand how anyone can think this. It's so completely different from 2013. We have over three years of increased user adoption. As a result, the price has risen slowly but surely to where it is now instead of after a mega bubble. 
And I'm not sure what bitfinex has to do with it. The price has been high (many weeks above $1100) since before they had USD issues.

Yes. When people buy crypto they sell fiat, which devalues the fiat. Inflation and devaluation have the same effect of higher prices in that currency, which makes people want it less, so they sell, devaluing it further etc.

I've enjoyed this back and forth. I was on the side of Markers until he claimed that you could use your old private key to get your new quantum safe one- as you pointed out this wouldn't work as others would also know your old private key. 
An alternative solution is to simply soft fork (would only require soft fork, if there was a previous hard fork to allow quantum keys) to a version when you cannot spend using legacy private keys at all. People would have to have sent their coins to a quantum safe address by then. Of course, this only works if this is rolled out a long time (at least a year) before quantum computers start to crack bitcoin. 
The better answer however is that Sha256 protects all bitcoins that are in an address that hasn't been sent from. And sha256 is not vulnerable to quantum computers. So it doesn't matter anyway.

Dude way to fail at the internet. 
His point was a good one and your answer was not. If your new private key is derived from your old one, then it can be discovered when quantum computers become available. The new quantum safe addresses must NOT have anything to do with your old private key.

The only thing that could make the private keys derivable is if the maths of BOTH elliptical curve cryptography and sha256 were cracked at the same period of time by the same person/group. This is so unlikely as to be negligible.  A 'bug' in the code could never cause this even in theory.

I agree that debt created by banks is money. But not debt created by individuals.

Thanks buddy that was a fascinating link. 
Let me get this straight: if a bank wants $10 cash, $10 of its central bank reserves are destroyed. 
But if a bank wants to create a loan, this same $10 of reserves can create ~$100 of loans (dependant on whatever the reserve ratio is) and the underlying reserve isn't even destroyed.

Do you really think it's fair to lump all 'drug dealers' in with the cartels? Obviously the cartels are a bunch of dicks. But the guy in the street that sells me some weed (hypothetically ofc) is not necessarily a dick. 


I don't like this word 'criminals'. It just means they are breaking the law. It makes no distinction between ethical and unethical activities. That's why I prefer the word 'dick'- a dick is someone who behaves unethically. So the reason evo was bad wasn't because they were breaking the law- it's because they stole everyone's money (thus, they were dicks). 
The owners of a dark net market that does not steal money (also does not sell guns/stolen credit cards) would be criminals, but not dicks. The distinction is incredibly important.

But as I pointed out earlier, the money you say is created in fact already existed. What is your response to this?
Also it does not have the same effect on the economy. When a bank creates money, the money supply is increased, causing inflation. When you lend me $10, the money supply is not increased, so it has zero effect on inflation.

But perhaps it would be too late if it had already been broken? Equal to closing the gate after the horse had bolted? 
Seems to me it would need to be changed before. And this would be incredibly controversial as it would literally turn all existing mining equipment into paperweights. 
Unless a new proof of work was required IN ADDITION to the current methods. Similar idea to giving a patient three different antibiotics in case the infection develops resistance to any one of them. Do you think a similar approach would be wise with bitcoin?

In my uneducated opinion, it is very unlikely to hold for a long period of time at stable prices. Investors are terrified of bear markets as they don't want to see their money shrink. But as soon as the bear market finishes- and there is stability- the fear will disappear and investors will rush in. As soon as they start to do this, signs of a bull market will appear, causing even more investors to rush in, creating a virtuous circle (for those of us who got in before anyway), causing the next in a long line of bubbles. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 10:36:12
Yes, but double sha alone being broken would surely spell the end of bitcoin? Proof of work would disappear and along with it the whole security model?

Hey buddy, I've finally finished reading the BoE article. It was really interesting.

The best I've found so far is  they allow you to list multiple addresses, and fairly easy to copy over to excel. But, they don't list the hash or the addresses sent to or received from. So still not great.

I don't understand why tightening the rules results in anything other than a hard fork? If we change max blocksize to 0.5MB, and say only 25% of clients upgrade, won't that cause the chain to fork?
But I think if 75% of clients upgrade then there will be no hard fork, although all the miners who didn't upgrade will forfeit all their rewards (I think).
So does a soft fork assume that &gt; 50% of clients will update?

The only thing that implies a 'fake market cap' is extremely low volume, like Ripple. 
Ethereum's trading volume relative to market cap is actually higher than bitcoin's. So if anything bitcoin is the one with a fake market cap. 
There's also the fact that there is no single person who owns 5% or more of all ether. Yet more evidence that bitcoin's market cap is fake, using your logic. 
You talk a lot about altcoiners who are annoyed at missing the early bitcoin rallies but it seems to me you are simply annoyed at missing out on the ethereum rally.

You are missing an important point, it doesn't matter who broke 'legal laws', it matters who broke ethical laws. Many people forget that the two don't perfectly overlap. Who cares if evo was illegal from the start, why is that relevant? What ethical laws were they breaking, before they actually stole everyones funds? Bernie was running a ponzi scheme from day 1. However, ultimately both broke the ethical law of 'don't steal' so they are both certainly massive dicks.

One potential negative aspect that I have not seen mentioned is that it is a deflationary currency vs current currencies which are inflationary
Some economic theory maintains that this will cause a deflationary spiral  
Many on this subreddit will state that a deflationary spiral either won't happen or is a good thing. I don't want to get involved in that debate, only to say that we don't know exactly what would happen if bitcoin became the primary world currency. It seems reasonable to at least consider the possibility that such a spiral will occur and it will be bad for the global economy.

Arguably, inflation provides the greatest incentive to hoard wealth and not put it to work- because you can simply invest in things newly printed money is used to buy (real estate, stocks) and get richer as more and more money is printed.

You are quite right, all of those things are incredibly unethical. I actually thought evo was just a drugs site. My bad. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 19:49:55
I think the one problem is however that it's impossible to prevent your emotions having a say. Whatever I decide, whether it's to invest all my life savings or 10%, it'll be an emotional decision. Of course I will do everything I can to arrive at a rational decision, but the only rational conclusion that can be made is 'the future is unpredictable'. Anything beyond that seems to me to have an air of emotion. 
One other thing Id add however is that although I agree with your point that an altcoin etc may end up being the big thing and bitcoin becomes worthless, that will not happen overnight. There is no reason why I can't sell my bitcoins for this altcoin in the future if I feel this is a likely possibility (obviously, with a lower price of bitcoin). The only thing I'm really worried about re. bitcoin is someone finding a flaw in the main protocol allowing them to spend other people's coins. That COULD happen overnight. And to my knowledge has happened already- it's just that the guy who found the problem communicated the issue privately to satoshi. Maybe the next person won't be so nice? 
@_date: 2016-10-31 22:07:10

I think it's worth mentioning that a LOT of people's first introduction to bitcoin is through trying to buy drugs online, from which they learn it's potential and start to invest directly in bitcoin.

Great post, except I disagree that even a 'massive code fail' wouldn't cause the cost to go below $10. What about a code fail allowing anyone to spend anyone else's bitcoins? That would immediately make the entire currency worthless.

Yes, as bitcoin moves from being used primarily as a commodity and more as a currency I imagine capital gains tax will be removed. Ultimately it will make as much sense as trying to apply capital gains tax to the dollar.

How certain is this though? In theory the Fed could buy back Treasuries and decrease the reserves it has recently created in order to prevent this. Also, the new basel 3 rules mean that banks now require more reserves to create the same amount of loans. 
Inflation/devaluation of the dollar is not entirely inevitable. 
EDIT: I meant to say, sell treasuries,  not buy them

I would say it's two things. 
1) They havn't taken the time to learn how bitcoin works- which is understandable, as it does take a bit of effort. So to them, they really do see it as 'magic internet money'. And without understanding how it works, it is impossible to appreciate the future potential. 
2) Most of us suffer a cognitive bias whereby we think significant, unpredictable changes to society don't happen. When significant events have happened in the past (9/11, 2008 financial crisis for example) we incorrectly feel they were predicable at the time which of course they weren't or they wouldn't have happened. This is the 'Black Swan' concept. It is reading The Black Swan (by Naseem Nicholas Taleb) that taught how history is littered and indeed dictated by hugely influential and hugely unpredictable events (like both World Wars for example. Did anyone in 1913 think that a huge international war was just around the corner? Of course not). I think bitcoin may be the largest 'black swan' to happen during our lives (except maybe the internet itself). Of course a future dominated by crypto is predictable to us, a tiny minority. But it wasn't predictable to any of us six years ago. And it remains unpredicted to 99.999% of humans alive today.

@_date: 2015-03-12 14:33:49
Gotta agree with you man. However I propose that perhaps it wasn't lucky that it happened in the early days- with every day that passes without a vulnerability being found, the less likely it is that a vulnerability will ever be found. Therefore, vulnerabilities are overwhelmingly likely to be found towards the start of the cycle. 
This of course ignores the possibility of new vulnerabilities due to patches. I just have to hope that the bitcoin development community know what they're doing.
@_date: 2015-03-14 23:06:21
Maybe I am mistaken, but I think you are confusing money supply and monetary base? It is the monetary base that consists of central bank reserves- given to banks to 'pad their books' as you say. The money supply is specifically the money that IS in circulation.

Dude, we have almost identical security arrangements! I also have an airgapped rpi, with a backup in cryptainer (similar to truecrypt) on Google drive. The difference is that I backup my wallet, not the seed. The advantage is that the wallet file is encrypted with its own password. So a hacker would have to brute force both the wallet password and cryptainer password (which are obviously different, and neither is used for anything else). 
Anyway, realistically speaking, our major weak spot really is someone coming to our house with a knife/gun and demanding we send him our coins. The only way to prevent this is multi sig, with part of the key physically held in a different location. But ain't nobody got time fo' dat.

The jump between $1200 to $8000 is broadly similar to the jumps that occurred between previous bubbles. I think $8k is a good ball park figure of the ATH following the next bubble. And rallies happen very quickly so there is plenty of time for this to happen before Jan 1st. 
Of course none of this could happen and it could still be $300 in a years time

This makes sense to me, so I'm a bit confused as to why QE is happening in the first place? 


This is fascinating! So fiat currencies aren't necessarily on a one way trip to inflation? It is possible for the money supply to actually shrink, without any central bank intervention? I did not know this.
I recently saw the 'hidden secrets of money' series and it did make the point that once there is more debt than 'actual money' in the system, the only way to pay off debt is by going into debt- i.e., after a point of time, it is simply not possible to pay off a nation's debt, am I reading this right?

Why does it matter if I receive from the same address many times? I thought the only thing that matters was not using your address to send from even once?

Can someone learn this noob please, the BIP 
does not mention anything about the 2x part of segwit 2x, so why do people keep saying that this is part of segwit2x? Is it not simply normal segwit, but with reduced activation?

If there was one fact in this entire universe that I wish everyone knew, it would be this.

I assumed that exchanges no longer pool holdings together in single addresses? Due to obvious security problems?

Is this still true if you use your private key to sign non transaction data? Or only if you actually make transactions?

Surely anyone can find out your change addresses very easily if they so wish, if they just look into the transaction where money left your publicized receive address?

He is talking about private keys :)
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:00:38
I agree with your sentiment buddy. I'm sure there are thousands of people out there far more educated on these matters than us who genuinely believe fiat money is superior to any backed currency.

Why has the yen become stronger despite all the monetary easing which usually devalues currencies?

Is it the case that eventually the money will leak out into the wider economy, causing inflation? Or not really?
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:36:08
The one thing I don't understand is why we've ended up with a debt based fiat system in the first place if it's so bound to fail? I can't accept that the 'people at the top' are genuinely either evil or extremely ignorant. There must be more to it?

@_date: 2016-07-22 17:04:01
Thanks buddy that's very helpful. I use electrum as my cold wallet, and have many transactions to the same address. I then sent from one of them, the change was sent to a new address automatically but the remainder is still there. I realise now that those remaining funds are at risk should ecdsa be broken (not a large risk admittedly). Electrum seems to assume that you only make single transactions to each address- otherwise 100% of your balance would be sent elsewhere. 
@_date: 2016-07-22 20:20:23
So you're saying we can get rich slow? 
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:00:12
So how long till this problem needs to be fixed? 
@_date: 2015-02-23 19:06:24
I'm leaning towards this too. Among other things, the regret I'd feel over missing the next bubble would be enormous compared to to any regret over investing 'too early'. I'd regret the former for ever, but regret the latter only until the next bubble finally arrives, whether it's tomorrow or in five years. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 23:05:52
could you link to any further details on this game theory work?
@_date: 2015-02-14 09:23:15
Whys it called that? 
@_date: 2015-03-04 23:01:11
No. Although that was quite a large code fail! I can't remember where I heard it, but probably 'The Age of Cryptocurrency' that I read recently. It mentioned how someone figured out how to send anyone's bitcoins to anyone else, but communicated this fact to Gavin and Satoshi. So it must have around 2010/11?

Is the game good?
@_date: 2015-02-09 20:23:24
Thanks buddy! That makes perfect sense. I also agree that the argument 'satoshi didn't want it that way' makes no sense, even if he had programmed in a limit. I dont understand however why it would cause a fork? Presumably whichever chain the majority of miners goes with everyones client will follow, and the smaller chain will die? Or are you saying the clients will 'reject' the new chain repeatedly because of code re. the limit? 
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:48:50
haha thanks buddy
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:20:46
I have tried both your fig tree method and the other guy's method of $10 moves, and I have found yours to work every time, 80% of the time.

haha goodo!
@_date: 2016-07-10 20:27:18
How would that be a fatal problem? Yes the miners would disappear, we'd have to wait a few weeks for difficulty to adjust down. And Chinese demand would be affected. But it wouldn't be game over.

Why should it be up to Satoshi how the public choose to refer to bitcoins? 
@_date: 2015-10-04 21:16:29
How!? Were they all he had? If so- has he recovered emotionally from this yet!?
It is kind of sad large a role regret plays in the lives of so many bitcoin investors (and former bitcoin investors). Pretty much nobody invests in bitcoin the same time they hear about it- most, like me, wait a couple of years or so.
@_date: 2016-07-30 21:54:43
I genuinely can't tell if he is a victim in all this or not. 
@_date: 2015-02-12 19:33:07
That's a great reply man, thanks very much.


Are there any sources which state what this actually is, and how it's changed over time? Is such a calculation actually possible?

oh. so the bitcoin core program I downloaded is separate?

So do I. Plus it ends the constant division within the community. Both halves of the community can go their separate ways and no longer have to worry about the other half. 
It worked fine for ethereum. Why not for bitcoin?

If a 2MB HF is dangerous insanity, what does that make UASF? Super double dangerous insanity?
@_date: 2015-02-25 14:50:09
buddy I just did a test, and you may be interested to know that the change addresses are NOT emptied after using them to send only a portion of its coins. Presumably this is intentional for some reason.
EDIT: ignore this, I think I just had a problem with electrum not updating.
@_date: 2016-07-11 13:37:08
Do you think that at the very least, it is good for the cryptocurrency scene as a whole to have coins with different consensus mechanisms, as a hedge against issues with any specific method?
This is why I am happy ethereum will use pos. Not because I think it is better than pow, but simply because it is different.  
@_date: 2015-02-12 11:53:14
I don't understand why he said that not even land has held its value over long periods of time? I've always thought land was like gold, an excellent investment due to its fixed supply?
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:10:28


And this is problem I think. The network effect of the developer ecosystem on Ethereum is so far ahead of bitcoin that I'm not sure bitcoin could ever catch up, even if segwit and lightning and 2MB were all implemented tomorrow. 
The few areas where bitcoin has the greater network effect- total value and number of transactions- is being eroded at a scary rate. Ethereum is also over 50% of bitcoin on both areas and growing quickly. Plus they already have a more secure blockchain, measured by revenue for miners (of course, when they go to PoS it is a lot harder to measure the security of the blockchain!)


Of that list, the only thing left for bitcoin is digital gold. I hope that happens as I still hold a bunch of bitcoin but arguably there is no reason for a separate blockchain to have this function. Why not the programmable or privacy blockchain?
@_date: 2016-07-11 21:26:38
What's the story? Was he goxed?
@_date: 2017-06-02 08:13:16
Ok, and what makes you think bitcoin will be 'the one'? 
@_date: 2017-06-21 17:05:28
I'm aware it has nothing to do with changing raw max block size. What it does have something to do with is forking the network in two. Hence, super double dangerous insanity.  
@_date: 2015-02-14 10:55:09
Fascinating thanks buddy. I get so annoyed with myself reading threads about people on the bitcoin waggon when it was $10. Why wasn't I there? Hopefully people will read this comment in ten years and get annoyed at themselves for not being here right now when it's a paltry $240.....
@_date: 2015-02-10 12:18:42


Really!? Then that would surely make coinbase a scam, since they would have sold more bitcoins than actually exist?
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:34:31
Not necessarily, they just copy and paste blogs of people who are...
@_date: 2015-02-11 22:03:45
Thanks buddy this was really interesting. I've only recently come to learn about the idea that the current fiat money system can't last forever and it's important to invest in other assets.
@_date: 2017-06-17 14:36:28
Ethereum has had multiple non contentious hard forks and one contentious hard fork and it's doing better than ever. If ethereum can manage it why can't bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-06-07 21:34:47

Maybe the reason he was calling him a moron wasn't because he disagrees with him, but because he is actually a moron.

Could you give an example? Such as, how would the market solve the negative externalities of large co2 emitters? 
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:31:43
Good question, I asked the same two years ago. Crypto doesn't eliminate debt it just makes it much harder to create so there will be much less of it. Currently, when a bank lends money the money isn't 'from' anywhere, it is created from thin air. A bitcoin lender cannot do this, they must have the actual bitcoin first before they can lend it. This has huge implications. Much much harder for governments to run deficits for example, because there is no central bank to print the shortfall 
@_date: 2017-06-10 22:11:47
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:58:04


No, but they do need to know what a commodity is


No but they need to know what Google is. 


No but you need to know what a blockchain is. 
Krugman should not be commenting on bitcoin when he has no idea what it is. Possibly he does know what it is and my info is out of date however. But last time I checked (which was ages ago) he strongly implied that, to his knowledge, the whole point of bitcoin was that it was digital which doesn't bring anything to the table because $ are already digital. Which is missing the point of bitcoin entirely. It's like saying there is no point in netflix because the same shows are available at your local blockbuster.
@_date: 2017-06-03 21:53:10


I'm assuming you're talking about Ethereum. Clearly this is false, or Ethereum Classic wouldn't exist. 


Matter of opinion. But in my opinion, if bitcoin devs were competent we wouldn't have the scaling issues we currently have. Ethereum is far closer to second layer than bitcoin. 


This was a decision supported by the community, or the ethereum chain would not have the far far higher market cap. 
If bitcoin was so much better why has its value compared to ethereum dropped by 90%+ since it was launched? 
@_date: 2016-07-10 21:20:03
That was awesome. It's like I'm living in the Deus Ex universe. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:28:04
Why not? What are you afraid of? That bitcoin (both forks) might go up 20x each?
Ethereum is an example of why we DO want a fork if anything. It is flourishing, and there is zero infighting because the two sides have completely separated and can focus on their own chain. Unlike bitcoin where all I ever see is two sides shouting at each other. Which as far as I can tell will NEVER end unless bitcoin forks. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 15:11:23
nope. i sent him money 31mins ago, and recieved it back (it was a test) 19 mins ago. He has both confirmed on electrum. I have neither confirmed on blockchain.info

@_date: 2015-02-25 12:43:54
thanks for your help buddy. One thing I don't really understand is the point of having separate change/receive addresses? Why not just send the change to a new receive address each time? 
@_date: 2017-06-17 10:53:43
If the community/market did not support the fork why is it the chain with significantly larger price/hash rate/transaction numbers etc?
@_date: 2017-06-17 08:02:25
If the community and market didn't support the fork it would not have been possible. So please tell me again how ethereum is centralised? 
@_date: 2017-06-01 21:29:16
I used to love it but got a bit fed up with their bitcoin maximalism. Ironically they risk being left holding the bag just like all the fiat bagholders they mention in that article.
