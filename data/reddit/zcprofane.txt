Yea it appears that way.  I get pretty invested into things though so I’m hoping it works out

That sounds like solid advice any recommendations on other things to invest my money in...  I’m 34 and really just starting my career due to bad decisions at younger years and I have a couple $1000 I could invest just not sure the right moves.

Thank you for responding how i asked... it just seems safer to me like I said I haven’t put much money into it yet but I’ve given some thought to it just dabbling right now and watching....  with every rise comes a dip though so I’m not in a rush
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:18:43
If your looking for anonymity check into Monero 
@_date: 2018-05-05 08:06:08
I’m interested 
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:57:24
Turn it into a whole btc
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:48:20
Well there’s a lot of speculation around exchanges especially with people being hacked on Binance.  So the price is going to fluctuate...  I made a decent amount back in December when the prices were very volatile I made a decent chunk so I’m just rolling with my profits from that now.

Alt coins and a lot of luck!!!  I have a vacation coming up so I moved must of it out to usd right before the “January Dip” and got back in on eth at $500
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:27:38
Thank you sir
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:35:53
People I worked with have been trying to get me to turn there 10k into more and I keep denying them I’m really just doing this for fun
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:58:05
I wish lol $4$ might be something to me then lol
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:50:12
Thank you for the advice.  
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:26:55
No not at all most of it was just purely luck
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:42:43
Reddit has been amazing and using twitter as well and I found out early that people sell the news..  Also a lot of luck was involved
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:33:50
Honestly like I’ve said a couple of times just right place right time and a lot of luck trading on Binance
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:01:54
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:47:43
It depends on how much you trade and how long a whole and the amount of btc you have that you are constantly working with... I made 3 bnb last about 3 months though
@_date: 2018-02-17 01:15:33
I didn’t I thought about it but I was there getting married and promised the wife no crypto talk for the week...  she almost slapped me when I pointed out the banner lol
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:44:04
I may check into bitmex...  and mostly just on price action with a lot of luck
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:42:44
I won on this last dip but I don’t always watch it so I’m sure it’s bound to go down again
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:26:37
I’ve been very lucky I won’t lie... just making the right moves at the right time.
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:18:58
Keep going you well get there
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:39:57
More like a speed bump....
@_date: 2018-02-08 15:29:17
Is that a thing does the IRS have a BTC address I can send the money I owe in crypto????
I joke I joke, I kid I kid
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:23:34
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:55:28
@_date: 2018-02-09 14:57:04
Ewwww sorry that hurts...  if it’s any consolation I used to use the original silkroad when btc was $3 each...  I’m pretty sure I have a btc address in my old tor email that has 2-3 btc in it still that I have no access too
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:02:34
I don’t think Robinhood will add much to overall value though
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:34:19
Keep up the good work staying in now should be good for long term
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:39:44
I wouldn’t really call this a dip....
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:25:41
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:57:24
That’s what’s up yea I will check into it
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:55:21
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:56:20
Hahaha and yeah I know I told them I don’t feel comfortable doing that I feel bad because they all did it on there own and lost but they got in later than I did and weren’t watching the market like I was
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:25:45
Yea I’ve gotten to that point lately where it’s less worth while to go short on stuff
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:24:19
Very true seeing as I only started with $100 bucks I can afford to lose it all but would really like enough for a down payment on a house that’s my exit point
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:25:19
Now u smell what the rock is cooking 
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:10:34
Oo lol I just read this hahaha
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:02:30
Very true lol
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:43:17
Lmao yeah hopefully it doesn’t go back down but who knows
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:37:28
Keep up the good work .3 is next my friend
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:07:40
Binance, and I held BNB to keep fees down
@_date: 2018-02-09 06:23:18
It depends on what your trying to do.  From what I understand Gdańsk has zero alt coins and there’s is quite a few alt coins on Binance 
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:54:49
I always keep my goals moving forward looking to make it a whole btc in 2 more months
