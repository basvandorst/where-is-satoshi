As a consumer if I receive the same amount of fiat equivalent that I spent I am ok with that. It's not your responsibility to regulate the volatility of btc. I think most people at this stage in the game using BTC are aware of its current nature. 
I probably underestimate dealing with retail customers however.

They are going to sell it for the most potential they can. It's not their personal money isn't really an argument. It's in their possession an in their best interest to sell it for the most they can.

I didn't think about that, that seems a lot more work than just selling on an exchange and having it transferred to my bank but i don't doubt someone would do it.

BS. if someone hacks my online banking password and empties my checking account that money is gone forever. If someone pickpockets my wallet, that's not insured. 
CC are insured but everyone pays for that in fee's eventually.

While not dismissing the need for encryption and the severity of the  problems, BTC is no different than anything else in the financial world that faces security issues. Credit cards, physical money, Atm's, are all subject to risk
If there is money to be made, someone will be trying to steal it and eventually will.

Assuming the bank trust that you are not trying to open a fraudulent claim. 
Btc security to no different than any other form of financial investment, OP installed a virus, you're naive to think it is any different for better or worse. How many credit cards are stolen every day.

It's not their personal money but it's their potential money. I doubt they hit the exchanges, my bet is an off exchange auction or sell.

I have an HTC one, my first android. Construction is solid, first phone I've ever used without a case. Sense is ok. Not sure if it's android or sense but there is so much more I can do with my phone than with the iphone but everything takes an extra step.

"don't share our values"  what values would those be, and who decides "our values"
Majority of people, no matter where they are from just want to have a job, go to school, lives their lives, spend time with family and friends.  You speak this pre-pakaged rhetoric without even thinking about what your saying.

IMO Bitcoin as having NOTHING to do with christianity... but then again most everything in my life has nothing to do with christianity. 
Side note: I do not totally disbelieve in a higher power but I believe that if such a thing does exist, it is beyond any form of comprehension that we as humans are capable of understanding, akin to explaining the love I have for my wife to an ant. **Religion** therefore is a creation of man out of mans own desires and needs and because of this is filled with all the faults inherent in mankind, which are then hid behind a thin layer of spiritual glitter. 
If there is such a god, I believe he will be smart enough to discern those who are inherently good people from those who are not.

Right, but to the average person those "choices" are made from a very short list of whatever is being spoon fed to them by suppliers. There is a reason entire industries (marketing, advertising, etc) exist in order to help the consumer better make those decisions.

No email and I made a trade with them this morning.

you should be able to set a limit order on some trading sites.

That doesn't mean a heavily advertised product won't out compete bitcoin though.

This is awesome, a modern day RobinHood. 
edit: except for the whole stealing part of course. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 05:47:43
The sad part is this will probably catch on, they'll partner with some major banks, credit institutions, online retailers, the masses will love it and bitcoin will never progress past it's relatively niche market. 
Edit for grammer.
@_date: 2013-10-25 07:44:39
Well it was sarcasm, but IMO BTC could easily fail widespread adoption if SuperCorporationX offered a similar and more accessible alternative that was heavily advertised. Avg Joe guzzling slurpee's will take the path of least resistance, it's just human nature. 
for the record I am invested long on BTC and do not believe Dwolla will survive.

That was about the same time I quit reading too.

Purchasing bitcoins is not illegal and if they are to become an accepted form of payment I see measure like this becoming the norm, think paypal. 
Your intent of purchase and further endeavors may be another matter but that is of a different discussion.
