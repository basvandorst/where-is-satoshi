The department of education is a legal branch of the federal government as per the powers granted to it (constitutionally) by the legislative branch. As per usual for Trump supporters, "unconstitutional" is used as short hand for "thing I don't like" when discussing Federal policies. Besides which, they aren't in favor of dismantling it. As I just told you, they are interested in strengthening it by forcing state schools to increase religious teaching. The Education department is constitutional thanks to congress, using it to teach religion is a breach of the First Amendment.
Edit: Also, can you please reply directly to the question I ended my last reply with please?

Edit: Also, I never suggested people who are opposed to the constitution of the United States were subhuman, just that people had a right to be legitimately worried about it. And disapproving of the federal government's education curriculum is entirely different to a woman with a certain amount of control over the government's executive branch explicitly advocating unconstitutional policies. Do you really think concern about politicians that openly oppose the constitution is all just "whining because Hillary didn't win"?

So every single person on Earth opposed to this administration's education secretary openly advocating religious teaching in state schools is only "whining because Hillary lost". Got it.
