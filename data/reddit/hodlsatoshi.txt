What does Litecoin have to do with Bitcoin? Why is it under r/Bitcoin and not r/litecoin?

How much of that $2 trillion did Mnuchin contribute?

Awesome. I'm looking forward to it. Keep up the good work,

I work for institutional investors and I know there's definitely big money on the sidelines. Q4 will be very interesting. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 18:51:15
Bitcoin makes sense to us. Putting money into an expensive equity market doesn't.

I lost about $300 through PayPal during high school (when I needed the $ the most) because PayPal sided with an eBay scammer. I vowed to never use PayPal again. Thank goodness for crypto!

Don't trust Bitmain! Their IPO is a train wreck so far. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 23:53:38
I'm surprised this guy isn't in jail. He scammed a lot of people in South Korea (hundreds of thousands of USD) and I believe he's hiding out somewhere in Canada.

Bakkt is more significant than a Bitcoin ETF. Wake up people!
@_date: 2018-08-12 20:48:32
I don't get why anyone listens to Paul Krugman. He's been wrong on bitcoin for years!
@_date: 2018-08-20 16:32:42
Exactly. It's just suicide for a company to do business with Ver at this point. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 12:46:23
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:12:12
He's as confused as ever!

Bitcoin is digital gold, an uncorrelated asset, and is the future. I totally agree with a 6% allocation.
Personally, I'm 95%+.
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:24:35
I boycotted them a long time ago! I can't deal with dishonest companies anymore.

Awesome! Welcome to the club. Now buy a Ledger Nano S or Trezor and store your bitcoin there. 
Storing bitcoin in your hardware wallet means YOU control your private keys and have full possession of your assets.

Just pass the torch already! All of these CEOs use the trustchain to market themselves. Give it to Francis Pouliot!
@_date: 2019-02-18 02:48:52

@_date: 2019-01-14 19:35:27
Yes, for iOS and Android. You can transfer from BTC to Lightning address. I've done it before.

How can anyone accurately predict Bitcoin's price? 
What if the Mt. Gox trustee dumps a million coins onto the market? 
What if Coinbase finally gets hacked? 
What if Tim Draper buys a million coins to take advantage of the discounted prices?
Price predictions are a waste of time! Focus on the fundamentals :)
