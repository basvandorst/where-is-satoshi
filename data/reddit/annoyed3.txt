It's a correction from an unsustainably high level, so an equally relevant question is, why did it rise so high, so fast? Due to counterparty risk, there is a limit to the rate at which holders of satoshis can sell them. I think a lot of satoshis that should have been sold during the bull market, weren't. By "should," I mean their owners wanted to sell them, but couldn't do it anywhere near fast enough to prevent the price from rising too high.

If I remember correctly, "BTC" was intended to be the name of the currency unit, precisely because, unlike words that end in "coin," it doesn't have a connotation of indivisibility. 
I sort of think of BTC as a substance. Other three-letter abbreviations that signify substances come to mind--"Put that bag of DDT in the truck, please." 
Also, I think we should say "worth of," as in "x dollars worth of BTC."

Consider somebody who is thinking of buying BTC at a big exchange, of which there are many worldwide. He/she notices that there are many blocks of BTC available at a wide range of prices. Naturally, he/she wants the lowest price. A number of things can happen:
1. He/she decides that all of the prices are too high and either “leaves” or submits an ask order for a lower price.
2. He/she buys some, but not all, of the BTC being offered at the lowest price and "leaves."
3. He/she buys all of the BTC being offered at the lowest price and even more, at the second-lowest price, perhaps continuing to the third-lowest price, and so on. This raises the price because there is now no BTC available to buy at the previous price.
Sellers of BTC do the same, but in reverse—they’re bringing their BTC to the exchange with the expectation of perhaps buying some national currency. 
There are millions of circumstances that can affect how the above-mentioned people behave, and, by extension, the exchange rate.

No password at all.

@_date: 2015-02-09 10:35:55
Actually, not quite "no password at all." I think the solution would require the use of a random-looking alphanumeric string to use in conjunction with the answers to the questions such that the user has to make sure to never lose it, but doesn't have to keep it away from prying eyes.

Hello. I've been working on an explanation for non-computer-experts such as myself, and here's what I have so far:
Bitcoin is hard to understand because it's hard to explain without talking in circles and having to define concepts in mid sentence. And the language and metaphors we use can be problematic.
A bitcoin is not akin to a coin, and is not, as some say, a number, but is rather a unit of magnitude of a quasi-imaginary substance (I say ‘quasi’ because it cannot be duplicated endlessly) that is measured not in liters, grams, etc., but something we call BTC, and very precisely (to 8 decimal places).
Participation in Bitcoin is possible at various levels. The simplest (lowest) level of participation involves using an online wallet that keeps a Bitcoin balance for you and allows you to spend from it. Then, working our way up, we have “clients,” which are programs you can download and run on your computer. These are more secure than online wallets because you don’t have to worry about the owner of the online wallet running away with your funds. Lightweight clients like Electrum (electrum.org) rely on remote servers to keep the common ledger (the block chain), while the standard client requires the user to store the ever-growing block chain locally. A still higher level of participation is mining.
The Bitcoin network is thousands of computers facilitating and keeping the ledger of one-way reassignments of amounts of BTC among Bitcoin addresses (also known as public keys). These reassignments are known as ‘transactions’ despite being one-way. Transactions are made using what is known as a private key. A Bitcoin address (public key) is a randomly-generated string of 34 alphanumeric characters to which the network credits amounts of BTC. 
From the wiki (
“A private key in the context of Bitcoin is a secret number that allows bitcoins to be spent. Every Bitcoin address has a matching private key, which is saved in the wallet file of the person who owns the balance. The private key is mathematically related to the Bitcoin address, and is designed so that the Bitcoin address can be calculated from the private key, but importantly, the same cannot be done in reverse.”
Users typically have many addresses. The ledger is called the block chain because it is a chain (i.e., series) of blocks. A block is a set of consecutive transactions that the network decides are valid. “The block chain” should not be confused with blockchain.info, which is a website that allows you to check balances, and offers an online wallet. 
The network secures the block chain from fraud through a proof-of-work scheme called mining. 
From the wiki: 
“The primary purpose of mining is to allow Bitcoin nodes to reach a secure, tamper-resistant consensus. Mining is also the mechanism used to introduce Bitcoins into the system: Miners are paid any transaction fees as well as a "subsidy" of newly created coins. This both serves the purpose of disseminating new coins in a decentralized manner as well as motivating people to provide security for the system.”
Keep in mind that the mining metaphor only goes so far. Mining involves testing sequential alphanumeric strings to see if they have a certain mathematical property. If you find the right string, (which is called “solving the block), the network awards you 25 BTC. Nowadays, mining is usually done in pools (as opposed to solo), so this amount is usually divided up among the members of the pool that solved the block.
About every four years (it’s actually measured in blocks), the block reward halves. So, for the first four years of Bitcoin’s existence, from sometime in 2009 until late 2012, the block reward was 50. Now it’s 25, the next halving will bring it down to 12.5, etc., until all the coins are mined in about the year 2140.
