Because the value is mostly in people's heads and it's crypto as a whole that people are seeing as less valuable not bitcoin specifically.

Only really the part about if you get in early and get out before it's too late you can do really well off it.
To create a bitcoin no actual value is created beyond the benefit many see in a non governmental currency, it's not like building a house where the net sum of "ingredients" costs' is less than the value of the house. The bitcoin value is only as strong as it's perceived to be which while true for most modern currencies (which used to be backed by gold or something but most aren't anymore afaik) at least those other currencies are based on the value of the "country". Bitcoin as far as I can see has a small value due to it's anti government control aspect but the majority of why the cost so much is sensationalism and expecting them to go up in value.
It's a bubble, bitcoin value starts on an upward trend which causes people to invest expecting a good return which in turn raises the perceived value as a feedback loop until someone bursts it.

not true at all, if gold suddenly had no uses, it would be worth a lot less, like a lot less, if it turned into equally rare brown useless muck that no one wanted for jewellery I bet you a million dollars it'd be worth less than 1% of it's current value in a decade after the super natural hype died down.

I just did, there is definitely a finite limit of bitcoins. 2.31 bit cents short of 21 Million to be exact.
Why should I believe your dismissal of the rest of my points if you couldn't even get that one right?
And, I did read previously when it was getting bigger, computational power used to mine the block chain isn't used for anything, no value is produced, unless you know something I don't and could share instead of being a withholding cunt?

To be honest as someone from r/all who thinks bitcoin is not that much different from a pyramid scheme this post sounds like "When you bet on 23 on roulette and your friends invested but you made more money".

I'm calling you a cunt for making a claim with zero effort, just saying "nah ur wrong" is so pointless, especially when you keep defending it after I did go research and found at least one thing you said was false wasn't false.

I fail to see how verification of the tech proving the transactions are legit is worth so much, you know paypal and banks exist right? Modern encryption is so hard to crack, yeah bitcoin is more secure but that's like saying a river is worth more than a stream when you're thirsty.

All currencies (and anything with value) hold value because people think they do, of that makes sense.
Bitcoins have that value due to being anti big brothery afaik, hard to trace or whatever, the more people value that the more they're worth. Also there's the fact that people think it will be worth more in the future so it's worth more now due to people buying it purely to sell later, it comes down to supply and demand, the supply is finite and decreasing in speed with every one mined but demand fluctuates, and eventually when the supply is emptied because of how the maths works it will probably collapse.
