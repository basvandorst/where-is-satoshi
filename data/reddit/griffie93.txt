I know what you're talking about but this transfer in doesn't. All my buy/sell clearly show the value of bitcoin when I bought/sold but this transfer just shows date and time. I guess I can just look at the date and time and line it up with the charts.

No, it doesn't. Whenever I buy bitcoin it does...but this transfer in just shows time and date.

Yes USD value is show but what I'm looking for is the value of bitcoin when it was transferred. 
I just used the chart and lined up time and date and I'll go off of that. I just don't know if the value of the bitcoin transferred was determined when I cashed out, or when it entered my account. But it's close enough to not matter.

From reading the reddit all day it's backed up because more hashrate is on BCC right now.

Not that I can see. When I "buy" or "sell" I can see all the info. For some reason it's the same on the other transfer I've done as well. No info on what it was valued at when received.
