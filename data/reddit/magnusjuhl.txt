I am not comparing the fundamentals of Bitcoin to stocks, I am comparing their price swings.

I’ll stop discussing from here. Claiming there is only one technical analyst successfully predicting Bitcoin and that it is not following typical market behaviour is simply out of reach. Have a nice day and keep HODLING

I originally replied to the comment that stated Bitcoin is different because of being uncorrelated to stocks. This is wrong.
You mentioned Apple - that is besides the point. The comment I originally replied to implied there was no correlation between any of the instruments mentioned in the article.
What does the inverse volatility bubble mentioned in the article have to do with a company’s debt, sales and dividends of companies? Nothing. It is speculative like Bitcoin is.
This is the same way the price of company shares with no voting rights are still following the movements of the company, by still only being backed by the faith of those who hold the stock.
Look at the transaction count over the last year. Has this risen along with the increase in price? No. This implies we are in a speculative phase.
We had a tulip bubble and no matter what asset the bubble is about, we still have the same mass psychology effect.
EDIT: Also, “gains” is a return on investment, so of course I’m relating gains to ROI?

Bitcoin cash?

No.

Can you please elaborate on how I have a disconnect in bitcoin markets? Wild price swings are caused by speculation, which is the fact I have stated.
Saying I have no idea what I’m talking about is pretty unbased considering your argument.

What are you talking about? Bitcoin is very much, like stocks, a speculative asset.
EDIT: “Bitcoin is a sort of tulip,” ECB Vice President Vitor Constancio said in September, comparing it to the Dutch 17th century trading bubble.
“It’s an instrument of speculation.”

Look at any professional technical analyst and their ability to predict price moves in BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:58:11
Okay, I’ll start from the basics. :-)
Are you able to explain the wild price swings BTC experiences without speculation playing a role?
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:32:51
Then they are not ‘disjointed phenomena’, as the comment I replied to implied. :)
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:16:19
You are contradicting yourself. If “a lot of people are in it for pure speculation”, then please explain how this does not have to do with return on investment?
Just like you and I get a boner with each drop, we are also buying each time because of this - which is speculation that price will rise.

Equally valid for Litecoin, yes.
Should one then be most interested in Bitcoin cash or Litecoin for transactions?
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:28:52
Seeing bitcoin with full blocks every time, it looks like there will be demand for bitcoin cash in the future? Or am I mistaken?
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:05:52
Lol. I understand the potential of cryptocurrency.
However, to state that investors are also not in Bitcoin to make a return is *straight up ignorant.*
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:24:17
Then it seems we agree. All my comments have been based on this assumption. ����

I was just thinking about this.
If you deposit some BTC for day-to-day transactions into a payment provider wallet, there is a one-time fee for this. The payment provider will then guarantee the coffee shop that money will be sent to them, maybe at the end of the day to minimize on-chain transactions.
It’s the same today with an store accepting credit cards - the money aren’t instantly in their hands, but it is guaranteed to arrive after a certain period of time.
