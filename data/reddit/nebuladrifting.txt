Totally sustainable.  $300k next week and $28 million by christmas!

Yes, but my credit card protects me against fraud, will pay for a purchase if I break it or lose it, and offers to refund the difference in price if I find it cheaper elsewhere.  I think bitcoin is great for a store of value and that's about it.  I believe crypto is the future, but I think it requires many significant refinements.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:13:55
Yeah I learned that the hard way when Mt. Gox took my 22 BTC with it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:15:07
Aw man :(
It sucks, but it's part of the game, where everyone knows they can lose everything, but they just don't think it'll happen to them.  What sucks too is the lack of sympathy here.  The top response to this seemed to be "look we found the wallet the coins were moved to, I can't wait to see if there's any more movement!"
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:34:23
Are you saying that I simply need to send another transaction to the same destination and from the same wallet, and as long as the fee is large enough, the new transaction and the stuck one will go through together?

$7254.  Don't get me wrong, I want to see it higher and I have a fair amount of BTC that I'm hodling.

What kind of job do you have?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:18:36
Damn, sorry to hear that.  Lost 22 BTC from Mt. Gox and it sucks.  Do you have any left?

If you don't know your password, you will need to mail in a claim to Japan by October 22.  See mtgox.com or for details

Can I do this right from my Blockchain.info wallet?  I'm reading up on how exactly transactions work and such and I'll try to figure this out.  Thanks for the start.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:11:33
Damn, and I just traded all my BCH for BTC a couple days ago.  Didn't even know I had it since my BTC had been sitting on an obscure exchange for the last 4 years and I just found out they gave me access to my BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:42:36
Yes!  That or Libgen, but I would especially like to see Scihub receive a donation.  I use it for research and it is invaluable.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:32:49
Oof is right, but things are looking promising right now and if the Japanese courts can be convinced not to proceed with bankruptcy, everyone might get about 20% of their coins back.  I likely would have sold long ago, so I'd be happy with that payout.

Here are a few transactions:
MtGox TOSS addresses:
MtGox HOT addresses (I think they are hot addresses.  If not, they are for sure still from MtGox):
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:54:47
The only reason I kept my 22 BTC on Gox was because I didn't want to pay their mandatory USD $1 miners fee to withdraw them.  Instead it cost me a lot more to not transfer them back to the safety of my Blockchain wallet with 2FA.  Dat greed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:43:14
If you sat through the crash of 2013, this was nothing.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:30:07
Looks like it finally went through.  I'm still waiting for mine to clear that I initiated on the 8th with a 	3.518 sat/B fee.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:53:46
Lost 22 of my 23 BTC from MtGox.  I feel ya!
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:22:07
Just pretend that you would have lost all of your bitcoins when Mt.Gox went down like I did at your age and maybe you'll feel better :)
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:39:28
Yeah and my claim was approved.  What about you?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:05:52
I paid about 0.2 BTC for an OK Cupid subscription in 2013.  Still happy with that purchase since it helped me find the love of my life!
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:32:40
My stuck transaction was only 3.5 sat/B ($0.07) and it's been sitting unconfirmed for 5 days now.  A month ago I transferred some BTC with only a $0.06 fee and it was confirmed in 10 minutes so I figured the high fees being recommended were just to be safe, but it looks like my 0.2BTC will be stuck for a while...  Safe to say I have learned my lesson.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:53:01
Same.  22 BTC just gone.  I wiped my hands and told myself I wanted nothing to do with Bitcoin ever again.  Thankfully I had 0.8 BTC in another wallet that I just let sit and now it's value is approaching my initial investment.  Sucks though.  It's worth $220k now.
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:33:38
Been waiting 18 days for my 3.5sat/B to go through..
@_date: 2018-11-25 05:21:48
What exchange was it?  I missed that news.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:48:56
Yep, just fucking kill me.  Bought at 7000-19000 in November-December and sold at 8100 a couple weeks ago hoping to buy back in lower.  Missed my chance and now this.  Granted part of that was almost a whole Bitcoin that I'd been holding since 2013 (leftovers after losing over 22BTC to Mt.Gox). Halp!
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:07:24
Well the hype has certainly died down since last fall, but I fully expect another bull run at some point.  You can sell now and hopefully buy back in lower, but at the end of the day, it's all just gambling.  We may not see another all time high for several years, or maybe we will see it again this year.  It's anyone's guess.  I panic sold mine last month at $8100, hoping to buy back in at $5k, but that didn't work out too well.  If I had just waited until the next day, I'd have a lot more USD to put back into Bitcoin one it reaches what I think will be the next bottom.  You do what you are comfortable with, and take what I say with a grain of salt, coming from someone who managed to go from 75 BTC to 24 to almost zero when Mt.Gox took them all in 2014.
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:23:17
I sold everything at $8k, hoping to buy back in around $5k.  That didn't work out well.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:43:30
Yep, and it's so refreshing to see those kinds of posts being downvoted now.  The sentiment on this summer has taken a 180 in the past few days.
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:48:21
Low: $60
High: $19,100 oof
Holding: 0 BTC, but I've got plenty of Fiat ready to buy back if it gets sub-$5k.
@_date: 2013-04-22 04:42:25
Good idea.
@_date: 2013-04-08 18:42:11
That's what I heard just after I transferred $9k to my Dwolla account.  I then panicked and sent most of the money back to my bank so that I could do a wire transfer to Mt. Gox.  I didn't send all $9k back because I found out that Camp BX takes Dwolla deposits up to $1000 per day, so I figured I would put $1000 in each day until I made the wire transfer.  Then I found out that Mt. Gox DOES accept deposits from new Dwolla accounts.  So now I'm still stuck waiting to put my other $5000 in when I could have gotten it in at $108.TL;DR use Camp BX and Dwolla if you are putting less than $1k/day.  Mt. Gox accepts Dwolla if you have a verified account.
@_date: 2013-04-19 18:57:47
I have verified Dwolla and MtGox accounts and was able to transfer up to $10,000 from my Dwolla to MtGox without waiting even close to 30 days with either account.

Just barely.  Modern password cracking software is often programmed to try several variations of each phrase using common patterns (look up Rainbow Tables).  Here's an example of what a cracker might sequence through:
try "password"
try "Password"
try "password1"
try "Password1"
try "p
try passw0rd"
try "p455w0rd"
try "passw0rd"
try "p
and so on...
A much better password would be something like "pass6w.oRd" because most people don't that.

I'm in the same position, but with USD $14,000 on the line right now.  I'm 20 and in school and I could afford to lose everything, but I hope I don't.  Go for it!

I did bookkeeping for a while, and if a server either had a really shitty week or failed to report their tips, the difference would be added to their paycheck to equal minimum wage.  I don't know for sure if this is a law, but considering how cheap the corporation that I worked for was, it would surprise me if it wasn't the law. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 02:44:18
How many sales per week do you do and what type of product do you sell?
@_date: 2013-04-19 19:08:37
Yes, on MtGox, go to funding options and use Dwolla.  It has to go through an AML check though.  My first deposit took a few minutes, and the other took 12 hours to transfer.Wow, I didn't know the queue was that long.  When I signed up March 23, the line was only a few thousand.

I've been thinking the same thing.  I think its time to pull my seventy-plus bitcoins out for a bit and repurchase when the price drops.
@_date: 2013-04-04 05:52:04
Im confused.  Is 21 million the theoretical maximum, meaning that if some miners choose to create less new bitcoins than the normal block reward that the max will be less than exactly 21 million?
@_date: 2013-05-29 00:13:24
I would strongly advise against using Mt. Gox.  They are currently in legal trouble and have proven themselves to be incompetent.Try CampBX instead.  I've been using them for months and have had no issues whatsoever.
