Some officers are good. Some officers only care about their own upward mobility and don't care who they hurt to get there. Obviously you both have had different experiences. As someone who has had many negative experiences with the police, I'll say only that while they may be looking into it, they are under no obligation to give us status updates and tend to keep things under wraps as it makes their job easier.

A 2.5 bitcoin sell would be enough to drive the price down $50. Maybe good for an initial buy, but only to send it to another exchange from there.

The kind of person who would be attempting a doublespend would need a very large hardware investment.

People are trying to beat the trend. If you see news that it's going to go down, you sell when you hear it, not at on the deadline. Everyone who was scared of the ban sold when the news came out. Now that it's actually upon us, it looks like people are predicting the price to rebound and trying to get in before it happens.

Coinbase is not an exchange. 1% on both buy and sell is not a low fee and when you buy or sell they interact with your bank each time, so you will have lots of floating transactions that will likely get cancelled. Also, they don't hold your money so if you sell, they deposit it into your bank again and when you buy again you have to wait a week for the bank transfer and confirmation.
Go to BTC-e if you value liquidity and low fees, go to bitstamp if you want trust and liquidity, go to Kraken if you want trust and low fees.

What he's describing is more a short scenario. They add x bitcoins to their database (not the blockchain) and sell them at $900. Now that the price tanked, buy x coins at $300 to stabilize the ledger. Total profit would be $600/btc.

Accepting BTC and storing it will likely only be viable for a business after the IRS determines how they want to classify it, until then, it may be more risk than you should be willing to take on. Until then, Bitpay and Coinbase are a reasonable solution to get your infrastructure up and running. I find it very hard to recommend altcoins for a business simply because of the low market cap and volatility.
The arguments in the links can be addressed as follows:
1. Bitcoin is not a stable store of value:
This one is true, however, you can't expect a fledgling currency, one backed only by market forces mind you, to be stable during its infancy. In ten years, it will be much less volatile, whether it's at 0 or much higher
2. Deflationary currency is bad:
This one is only true if it replaces our native currency. So long as we don't issue debt in bitcoins, we should be safe from the ill effects of deflation.
3. Lack of regulation:
You can't regulate dollars either. The fact that the blockchain is fully transparent makes the more criminal acts traceable while making it inefficient to attempt to track unimportant transactions.
4. No intrinsic value:
I will argue that a global, decentralized payment system that is cheaper and faster than traditional systems is intrinsic value. So is being a fallback to rapidly inflating currencies (see Venezuela)
5. Botnets can outmine more than honest miners:
False, even if a hacker designed a virus that could detect what kind of graphics card its host system had and was designed to take advantage of each, ASICS would still outperform them exponentially.
6. Altcoins will overthrow the throne:
It is possible that an altcoin will one day take the limelight, but it would need to do something truly groundbreaking to overtake the original. 
I don't think I've missed any points, but feel free to ask if there's anything else EDIT: Fixed table

You mean existing orders that were placed after it went to 390 yesterday...? Price is currently consolidating between 385 and 425. It could go either way, and though the bias is certainly to continue the trend downwards it's not being held up by any existing buy orders.

I think the biggest one is trying to lure people into altcoin pump and dumps. I bought in a couple times when I first started started and it ate most of the gains I had made from the last bubble. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 17:40:22
You mean if someone eats the order before you? Well yes, but just because market price moves doesn't mean you aren't selling at market price. If you are absolutely deadset on selling instantly, you can put the price to zero and it will sell at market until you run out of coins. The point is if you undercut the market with low enough volume, you will still sell at market price instantly.
If your saying that if the market price is 750, you want to be able to sell 150btc at 750 instantly, then you're just being unrealistic and your notion that the market price can be locked in for your whole order by hitting sell at the right time is misguided.

Mt. Gox finishing its exit of the market means that the market had likely hit it's bottom. The market was ripe for a trend reversal and with the trendline broken, people are worried they'll miss the boat and buy, triggering bots to go bullish and buy as well. This leaves us where we are now.

That and it should get easier to pull out as infrastructure strengthens. Do you have the option of increasing the fee for the transaction? That might help. You could also asking for help from one of the original support staff directly. They have a lot of new workers there and not all of them know a whole lot about what they're doing I'm sure.

Yes, I agree as historically, that is what has happened every time Bitcoin crashed in the past.
Oh. What's that you say? Bitcoin historically reaches a new ATH then drops to about half of that, seeing volatility until the next boom cycle? And that's exactly what seems to be happening now? So why is it you think this bust cycle is any different than all the ones prior. If anything there is more confidence now than during any other crash. How is this time different?
Also, way to cherry pick the timeframe considering if you zoom out to 2 weeks, it's up
@_date: 2014-05-12 17:16:14
That's well below the rate of inflation anyway though. Even if you decide investing in bitcoin is a bad idea, the bond is also a bad idea. What's the point in gaining 5% of your investment in 6 years if it depreciates 10% in the meantime?

He's not wrong. When you set your sell below the current buy, it eats orders downwards until it hits your sell price or the order is fulfilled

All of those gains get piled into one box though. I'm not saying you need to keep track of all that, just your gain. If, over the course of daytrading for a year, you turn $1000 into $1500, you need to mark a $500 gain for that year.
If you could trade 1/100th of a corn contract for a cookie halfway through the year, yes you would have to determine appreciation for tax reasons, but that's not something that generally comes up because not many people sell cookies for corn contracts.

A smarter play may have been to transfer your funds from the second rate, nearly empty exchange you were using to one that people actually trade on. There are two important factors on an exchange are fees and volume, and a spread like that means there is no volume.

It only applies if you experience gains.

In order to use BTC, you must own a useful amount of BTC. The more people who hold enough BTC for it to be useful, the smaller the divisions required for it to have use. If 5 people own BTC, owning 1/5th of all BTC is still not worth an impressive amount, only as much as those 5 people believe is enough for usefulness averaged. If 500 people are invested and you control 1/500th, it's about the same, but if you were one of the original 5 and you see an influx of 500 you may find your value has gone up by a significant amount, at least enough that the other 4/5ths are worth enough for 500 people to find them useful.
Very simplified obviously, and market sentiment has a much larger effect on price most of the time because there simply aren't enough new users to be meaningful. The effect of new users is most clear during bubbles, when market sentiment is rising, bringing new users, which increases price, which causes sentiment to rise further and so on.

That already exists. You can create your own coin in minutes. A whole bunch of custom coins flooded in and most did a whole lot of nothing. Dogecoin and Litecoin were probably the most successful of them. Knock yourself out: (
The reason new coins are mostly worthless is because the token isn't what is valuable, it's the network. Whatever new shitcoins pop out need to build a following, entice miners to spend time and money securing the system and attract speculators with something unique. The work isn't in creating the coin, it's in creating the network.

The value is just the last price two people decided to exchange it for based on a matching system. For example. Right now, lots of people are saying "I'll sell a bitcoin at 752" and other people are saying "I'll buy a bitcoin at 749" and whenever they meet at the middle, it's broadcast as the new price. If someone buys all the bitcoins that are being sold at less than 755, 755 becomes the new price until another exchange happens

No, because the exchanges will always match the best price. If you put in a sell order at $200, it will fill the bids in the orderbook until you run out of coins or until the next bid in the book is below $200. Likewise, you can't buy a $1000 coin while there are lower priced coins on the books.

It's fairly easy to buy in at Coinbase, the real problem is that you're trying to do it *now*. There are so many people trying to buy into bitcoin right now that the infrastructure of many of these sites is maxed. If you don't want to buy local or wire money anywhere, you may want to wait until things calm down a bit. Of course, nobody knows what the price will be at that point, so you'll have to choose what's more important. Time and risk spent trying to join the panic, or potential monetary loss later.

Again, Bitpay converts the currency the moment they get it from you at the current rate. That is the purpose of their business, to make BTC/USD transactions convenient. They don't hold the bitcoins, they turn them to cash in order to pay the merchant, in cash. If you want to be paid in bitcoin, the best I could ever see them doing is receiving the money from the vendor, converting it back at the new current rate, and refunding you the new sum.

It's automatic, contact support, they whitelist you and put your original transaction through, which you would know if you searched at all.
EDIT: Also, if the funds didn't leave your account, your bank may have flagged it. They tend to err on the side of caution when it comes to bitcoin it seems. Most exchanges don't have to worry about it since they rely on wires instead of linking to your account.

Think of it like other commodities you buy. If you see the price of gas dip, are you more likely to buy it? I know if I see gas go down 10c I'll more readily pull into the station. I want my cheaper gas now, regardless of the fact that it's trending downwards and I might get it for another 10c cheaper tomorrow. 
Conversely, with an inflationary currency, you are forced to save more. If you want to retire, you need a certain amount of money to hold you over. However, if that amount is constantly increasing, you need to hold onto more and more.
You are looking at the market in a hypothetical way and making some assumptions about what people want. In reality, most people aren't as worried about getting rich as they are about affording their next purchase.

When that becomes the case it will move down another 3 places and we will use microbits instead of millibits. 4 spaces may make sense to you, but prior naming conventions are obviosly a better choice for the least confusion. Besides, 8 decimals are not a hard limit, so as coins continue to increase in value we can go all the way down to yoctobits with no confusion because we are using a previously established naming convention.

It can be used as wealth storage that won't depreciate at the same rate as the dollar. The more you expect the dollar to devalue, the better bitcoins look.

My vote is to take 6k and invest it now, invest 6k after the market settles from this big move half the board is stressing over, put 5.5k in an IRA this year and again next year, keep the rest as an emergency fund. 30k is a lot of scratch, and if you haven't diversified at all (as you said below) it's really hard to advise you to put all your eggs in this basket.

It's got margin trading and a few nice features. It's NY based and I have personally had nothing but good experience with their support staff. Downside right now is because it's so new they don't have all the regulatory stuff in place, so you can't send money in if you're in the US, only coin. Also, because you deal in trading pairs you get nearly instant trades but you can only cash out in the currency you put in, so you'll still rely on Coinbase to actually withdraw money.

For the same reason I have no issue with millimeter or milligram, it's a commonly accepted prefix for a unit of measure. It can be understood by anyone without explanation. It serves its function better than any alternative. Besides that, if people don't want to call them millibits, they can call them whatever the hell they like, but the precedent set by the metric system regarding both naming convention and units of measure would be difficult and unnecessary to break.

He got forced out at $559 and is responsible for $24000 in losses, which is how he went from 25k to 1k. The price went back up, but the system already sold him out and took his losses. It likely tried to sell him out at 30% but there was no market support left so it sold him at the bottom. He can't not pay because his money was already there for them to take. He can still trade, but only with the 1k he has left.

Realistically, it would have no immediate effect on value. If someone is holding onto 1 million btc and loses it, it's all the same to the market.

Bitcoin does not have to replace a countries native currency to live up to its potential. It can very easily be used as a deflationary store of wealth that doubles as a frictionless currency while the native currency is used for debt based transactions.

That can't really happen though. The exchanges aren't banks. They aren't the ones reimbursting you, buyers are. 
In a bank run, everyone goes to the bank to get their value, banks run out of the backing, chaos ensues.
In a parallel situation, sellers flood btc, buyers stop buying, value plummets. 
The situation is similar but in the second one, you'll notice that the institution (the exchanges) are not liable at all and thus can continue functioning without problems.
The only problem would be processing bank orders in a timely manner if everyone wanted out, but since the money is all coming from the buyers and not their own wealth, there is no financial damage to the exchange.

It can be profitable but it is very easy for it to lose you money. If you watch the markets you will notice that altcoins don't just move on their own, their price is tied to bitcoin. If bitcoin crashes, altcoins will too, so really you are playing with twice the risk.

They have a very nice interface for you to wait for your beta key right now :)
On a serious note though, I will say even though I have not yet used the exchange, I am already impressed. I signed up for the beta and emailed a couple questions to their support line regarding their terms (If you read into the knowledge base, you'll notice that you can only withdraw in the same type of units you deposit.) and I received a response within 30 minutes. I replied back and was responded to again in minutes. This was after 5pm too. I was expecting growing pains but their support is spot on.

I bought in at 290 and sold ~40% at 700 to cover my buy-in. My plan was to sell 50% at 580 and then 25% if we hit 1040 but I wasn't watching close enough and missed my target, not that I'm complaining but I'm just saying I'm not solely speaking in hindsight. I don't think anyone was buying with the expectation to level out at $1000
Consider this. No matter how good the news is, it takes 5-7 days for new accounts to start buying in. The Senate news will bring in new blood in a few days but everyone trading it up to 8-900 was already here and had already bought in previously. The price can only go up as fast as new money can come in and the faster it hits that limit, the harder it falls back. 
As it stands, the market will stagnate for at least a few days before starting to move again. Until then, I'm buying at ~7:30am and selling at noon. Feel free to laugh at me if the price hikes between 1pm and 7am before the weekend btw, it'll mean I lost a little money.

No way to know for sure but I have a feeling this weekend drop was only a small hiccup. As soon as labor/armistice day is behind us and the banks reopen we will see a lot more business pouring in. There was a lot of media attention on bitcoin lately and a lot of people will have just finished approval through Coinbase/exchanges as of this week. 
@_date: 2013-11-14 14:43:09
The price is getting rather frothy, but I don't know that this bubble is near popping yet. Much of the price increase can be attributed to the wave of positive media attention and a quickly growing global interest.
As for centralization, yes it is a problem. Here in the US, it is not terribly pronounced but it is visible. Inflation eats away at your ability to save in an effort to get you to spend, but inflation makes most investing nearly worthless. Consider bonds, you buy an iou from the government + interest. Currently, buying a bond will return you negative money because even after interest is factored in, inflation has decreased the value of the money to less than what you initially lent out. 
People may set up their wallets in an insecure way, but is it really so different than how insecure we are with anything else? You can guess over 90% of debit card pin numbers in less than 70 guesses because of how predictably lazy we are. Security will also increase as people create more intuitive secure applications.
As acceptance becomes widespread, volatility will diminish. In the meantime, we already have services like Bitpay to bridge the gap.
Speculation is healthy because it garners attention. It's okay if the prices rise and fall, as long as the general trend remains positive Bitcoin will gain acceptance

1. Bitcoins market share is so small that shooting to $1000 or even $10000 would barely impact the dollar, and even if it did, the fed could just stop printing money for a while to compensate for inflation. For the hypothetical millionaire he would be stupid not to withdraw some of it, because it would be very risky to have such a large percentage of your holdings in one venture. He can easily invest 75% of that elsewhere and keep the rest in.
2 Most people will spend, because when your money goes further than you expect it to it feels like you're getting what you want on sale. You can always buy more bitcoin as you spend to replace it.
3 See above, we can just go to millibits and really, most of the time you're just going to be scanning a code anyway. It's like me complaining about pocket change when I only spend with a credit card.
4 Bitcoin is made to serve as a currency and a store of value. It isn't made to make everyone rich because magic internet money. Also, a 200-300% increase on returns yearly is unheard of in practically every other market. 
5 If this gets huge enough to threaten the dollar, it will be too late. It will have the fed against it, and some banks and credit cards. Other banks and corporations with have adapted by then (see Bank of America), wall street is getting invested invested, corporations will want it to stay for their bottom line. See, the beautiful thing is the more momentum this gains, the more powerful people will invest in it to get a leg up on their competition. Enough momentum and we will have an even match. The fed has home field advantage, and bitcoin has a currency model that will strip the value of the dollar as time goes on (inflationary vs deflationary). Lobbying and beaurocracy would only drag the fight on until the government realizes they can switch to bitcoin and pay the chinese debts in toilet paper money. (this all probably won't happen but if it does, you heard it here first!)

Pyramid schemes generally have a centralized entity paying out until it has determined it has amassed enough money and shuts down.

This is incorrect, he got $35k of Bitcoin on 12/18, at the market rate of 12/8.
This is 8 business days, typical coinbase transactions take 7. They allot 4 business days for the bank funds to transfer and 3 days to acquire the bitcoins from cold storage or bitstamp. OP was probably confused and thought that he would get them as soon as his bank transfer went through. Notice there is not a single screenshot showing any guarantee from coinbase as to when he would actually receive his coins. I have never seen coinbase allocate less than a full week of time for non-instant transfers, anyone on here who has used coinbase can attest to this.

I feel like there is a lot of weight in the description of bitcoin. The currency of the internet. It has no physical home country and as such, no matter where you live, bitcoin can be treated as a foreign currency. Trading USD for BTC is really no different than trading to the euro in a lot of ways. It doesn't need to replace any other form of currency (though it may) but traditional banking concepts like loans can still easily be handled in conventional currencies. I can't see Bitcoin outshining local fiat in cases like this for years but that's okay because they can coexist.
As for the problem of infinity, this is really not a problem at all. There is no difference between 1.00 bitcoin and 1.00000000000000 bitcoin, and if someone owns 0.01 bitcoins or 0.00000000000001 bitcoins doesn't change the percentage of the market I hold with my 1 bitcoin.

Yes, they do a double charge to confirm it when you sign up just like Paypal. You should be aware that savings accounts generally have transaction limits though, so your orders may get cancelled. You can give your bank login credentials to make it instant instead of waiting for the charges to show up if you choose (I didn't go that road though, wasn't comfortable with it). If you attach a credit card as well (Visa only atm) you can also buy 1btc/week instantly. After 30 days post-purchase, this limit increases to 10btc/week

Even if you don't buy now, set up a wallet and account with an exchange so when you are ready to buy in you don't have to wait for authentication

Typically once you hear from support, they give you the coin at your purchase price and whitelist you so the system doesn't catch you again. It probably saw you as high risk because of the multiple transactions. It's automatic, so just wait for support. This is a common problem with coinbase

That article is three days old. The market has since crashed to 500 and recovered to 700

that's only for 1, you get 10 after 30 days

No, coinbase is not an exchange. If you want to play around, BTC-E is the quickest to set up. Don't know that I would send in &gt;1BTC but it's nice to fool around with. To set up a limit order just set your sell price over the current buy prices or vice versa

Every time a new block is created, more bitcoins are added to the market, hence inflation

I don't have a bot. I just noticed it seems to dip in the mornings so as long as that trend continues, I'll buy then. I'm not confident enough in the market or my knowledge of bots to program one to make me a profit.
And you're saying that if newcomers could have gotten money in on Monday after seeing the news, it wouldn't have risen higher before crashing? I'm afraid I'll have to disagree with you on that.

You say the dollar is neutral, do you complain about cents? They are SI (centimeter etc)
The entire world uses SI, and the terms will probably get shortened further because people are lazy with language. I can see buying things with "Mils" and "Mics", can't you?
@_date: 2013-12-03 14:26:32
I suppose because your dollars will be worth less in the future but your income is likely to remain the same. This infers that you will be less able to pay off any outstanding debt in the future because at that time you will be spending more money on necessities, leaving less for loan repayment.

It's projected to go down, and also up.
My personal projection is down, for what it's worth (nothing)

I should've mentioned I'm US based instead of just inferring it with my account with Coinbase (US only)
I've just discovered itBit only accepts non-US residents for now, so they are out. I will try out Coinsetter and update in a couple weeks with my experience.

It's because the people who live in fantasy land don't know when to leave the fantasy. They wait until their dreams get crushed to sell out. They're the ones that buy while it rises and sell when it crashes. I finally just bought in with a couple coins and I can only hope I don't let the dream blind me in my inexperience.

Bitcoin have lower fees than cards, corporations can charge less for products sold for bitcoins. Have you ever seen gas stations that charge ten cents a gallon more for using a card? Or stores that have a $10 minimum for card purchases? Not necessary with Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-20 14:36:10
While that may have been a minor contribution, I think we all know that crash was predictable. There are people with a lot of money in bitcoin and when they see the price go up in an unsustainable way, they cash in. Then the day traders and bots sell to take advantage of the swing. Then the new investors sell out of fear that they made a terrible choice. All the traffic causes huge lag too, driving the fear into panic, but that's only a catalyst. In truth, everyone saw the crash coming, it was a matter of when, not if.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:47:19
I really am surprised that after the first lead-up, nobody has really been mentioning the fact that 4 days after the crash we're priming up for another moonshot.
You know, if you look at that "stages of a bubble" graph, maybe the "crash" was the bear trap. A man can dream.

Definitely get support, they usually give you the coin at original price and whitelist you so it doesn't happen again
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:21:46
Of course you will be charged $6600. That is the amount you told them to withdraw. When they get that amount from your bank and have completed their buy order, they will give you $6600 dollars worth of bitcoin at the new rate, whether it's 10, 100 or 1. 
If you didn't have the money in the account, why did you buy that much? The best thing you can do for yourself is call the bank and cancel the transaction before it's done processing.
@_date: 2013-11-19 18:41:51
If I'm not mistaken they are trying to circumvent certain tax liabilities or New York state regulations. It doesn't really affect much if you're in the US because you can use it for day-trading and then move to Coinbase for withdrawals.
Edit: The real flaw right now is not being able to get USD in if you have a US based account. Once that regulatory hurdle is cleared it will be much better off.

They have an automated system to weed out fraud and you triggered it. There is no human intervention in this system due to volume of transactions. Email support and they will honor the transaction as they always do. This has been discussed to death on here and you are potato for failing to notice.

Yes, and if they were open over the weekend, perhaps they would have settled this sooner. But they aren't, and the 14th was a Saturday.

In the same boat here, was 290 by the time I got verified and paid. Of course, the transaction is still pending as well, so I'm completely hamstrung if I want to sell. This holiday weekend is going to cost me sleep.
@_date: 2013-11-12 18:46:45
I'm in the process of searching for an exchange as well. From what I've been through so far, it seems best to initially invest through Coinbase (assuming US) then move the bitcoins to an exchange so you can buy and sell at speed and with lower fees. If you go straight for an exchange you have to deal with wire transfers and it ends up costing more. 
I'm leaning towards Bitstamp at the moment but has anyone tried itBit yet? It looks promising and the fee schedule is actually lower but I'm hesitant to try such a new startup

Wealth isn't lost by burning money. If I burn a million dollars, the rest of the dollars in the world are worth that much more. In the same way, if you print more money, you don't create wealth, you devalue the total amount of it.

If you see that gas prices are going down, do you drive your car to empty in an effort to get the cheapest gas possible or do you say "Ooh, cheap gas" and stop to fill up?
If you see gas getting more expensive do you top off as often as possible to avoid buying gas all at once later at slightly higher prices or do you wait until the last minute hoping for the trend to reverse and then filling up when your tank is empty.
Same concept.

"First of all the amount of gold is not finite. They are digging more out of the ground every day."
You are saying that there is infinite gold on earth. I'm going to have to disagree with you on that. That is like saying there are infinite bitcoins because we are mining more every day.
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:14:25
The real problem I see is with the value of Bitcoin going up over the course of you loan, causing you to owe more in value. If I lend you one bitcoin worth $100 and in a year you have to pay me one bitcoin worth $1000 plus interest, you're not going to be happy. In reality, bitcoin debt would often be completely inescapable unless it becomes MUCH more stable, and even then it's deflationary by nature. Bitcoin does many things well, but debt is not one of those things at all.
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:48:25
Ah, I thought you were looking for the fastest withdraw/deposit time for USD. I have heard nothing but bad things about MtGox as far as speed is concerned, I'd say BTCE is the better between those two
