I used both mtgox and bitfloor.
Bank -&gt; dwolla -&gt; mtgox takes about 5 days. The wait cost me about $144 at the current market price of $66/BTC ($500 deposit, hoped to buy in at $47.5, finally got it at $60). Your dwolla account has to be older than 30 days and you have to wait ~2 weeks for mtgox to verify your account.
Bitfloor is much easier. And anonymous. Register -&gt; create a deposit request -&gt; go to any Bank of America branch with cash in hand (no id required) -&gt; deposit cash to specified account (must deposit **exact** amount). Money is available to spend on the exchange in about 10 minutes (less in my experience).

You are missing a very very important aspect.
When the big pocket non-believer speculators start selling and the value crashes, true believers will scoop up cheap coins - and they will still be worth something because there will be a significant fraction of true believers.
There might be significant bubbles on the way - but someday we'll get to a stable non-speculative equilibrium.

Okay. Scratch everything I said about bitcoin-qt, I was assuming you were using bitcoin-qt for your local wallet. I missed the fact that you were using multibit. I know nothing at all about multibit.
I read about it a little just now, and it seems like it's just another client, albeit unofficial. It should work exactly the same, except that multibit's xxx.wallet files and bitcoin-qt's wallet.dat files are not cross compatible.
So, modified instructions:
* Open up multibit
* Load wallet into multibit
* Wait for blockchain to fully sync
* You should see your money in your wallet. If not, look at the transaction log and see where it went.

They could buy up coins, loan them at interest, collect interest while the value of coins is still appreciating because the banks now have to be paid back, so the interest has to come from somewhere. I'm just afraid this will result in banks accumulating a lot of coins..

This is with CURRENT bitcoin hashing power and current difficulty. Difficulty is projected to rise quite a bit when BFL finally ships, but that could be 2-6 months from now, so if you start tomorrow (I would if I could), you'll make at least ~10 BTC which by that time will be something like $5000.
The wiki also states the cards produce 685 MHash/s, so mine is a conservative estimate.

What incentive does a user have to go with any cryptocurrency at all, then? Why not just pay with fiat?
The market will decide which cryptocurrency wins.


The problem is that the other cryptocurrencies aren't worth anything at all. In order to make them worth something, they must become valuable in the public eye - difficult to get.
Furthermore - it won't be more profitable to mine an altcurrency than bitcoin due to simple market rules.
Concrete example: right now, it's twice as profitable to mine litecoins as it is to mine bitcoins, sell them for bitcoins and sell bitcoins for USD. Therefore, miners are flocking to mining litecoins - but due to increased hashrate the difficulty increase is extreme, and in a very short time the profitability of mining both BTC and LTC will equalize.

The upcoming difficulty adjustment will take care of that.
@_date: 2013-03-11 16:05:40
It tells exactly why: there are too many transactions for the upcoming block already, and it tells you that you could up the fee a little to make sure it's included. The client for some reason doesn't give you the choice to submit it anyway, but you could just wait until right after the next block is mined and send it.
I've done exactly this before and it works.

4 x 650 MHash/s = 2600 Mhash/s

That's the thing: there is a balance. If it becomes less profitable to mine, miners will move away, but the difficulty will also decrease, attracting miners.

Except difficulty is increased every 2016 blocks, so if those blocks are mined in 2 days, difficulty will jump up after two days. Bitcoin will self correct difficulty very very quickly.

Other way around. Abandon mining on 0.8, roll back to 0.7.
As for your question, research a little bit more. Start with the FAQ in the sidebar.
Short answer: it won't be "a miner", it would have to be the majority of total bitcoin hashing power.
@_date: 2013-03-07 04:55:07
I'm pretty sure I read the same comments 2 years ago.

Here's the catch: flooding the market with worthless altcurrencies will accomplish nothing at all due to network effect. Bitcoin already has a 0.5 billion dollar market cap, even though it's just starting to become accepted and people are just starting to find out about it.

This isn't true, otherwise you wouldn't be able to shop around different ESCO providers who give you different prices. My assumption is that prices are different due to different profit margins.
Some companies do exactly what you describe - two months low, the rest goes to market price.
However, this one doesn't appear to be a scam. It does seem a little too good to be true, but with no ETF I don't think I have much to lose.

The algo is pretty simple.
Start with reward = 50, totalBTC = 0.  
Every 210000 blocks the reward halves (ie 25, 12.5, 6.25, etc).  
After every block, totalBTC = totalBTC + reward  
Boom, now graph totalBTC.
You could probably do this in Excel, although I am not 100% sure.

They have intrinsic value because they are a better form of money - there is no one who can influence the inflation rate unless by consensus from 51% of the network. There is no one who can tell you "no, you can't make this transfer". The value is in the network.
For this reason, I doubt bitcoin will ever fall down to zero. It'll either stabilize at &gt;$100000 or stabilize around $10. Same as gold, really. The industrial value of gold is definitely not &gt;$1500/oz.

The value won't fall to zero regardless, as there are enough people to think that the protocol fundamentals are good. There are enough people to want p2p transactions without involving anyone else. If no one else, the underground crime will still use bitcoin - for anything from drugs to human trafficking.
@_date: 2013-03-12 06:51:05
Correct. 3-4 days is how long it takes to confirm a transaction in the world of banks and credit cards. With Bitcoin it takes about an hour to confirm with 99.9% certainty (6 confirmations).

There is no such thing as an individual coin. It's just a balance on an address, and the balance is verifiable by anyone who has a copy of the blockchain (think public transaction ledger), which is everyone running a bitcoin client.
Your wallet contains keys that allow you to sign an outgoing transaction, verifying that you, the real owner of the address, sent money to another address.

It would be nice to make it completely optional, but I don't feel like recompiling bitcoin-qt just for that - too much headache with winblows.

You are correct. This is why it's advised that you use the optional encryption in the original bitcoin client. I believe derivative clients force encryption on you.

Yes, and the unit is called mBTC - one thousandth of a BTC.
So in your example, you would work all day and make, say, 5 mBTC. Assuming this is equivalent to making, say, $100, you would then in the evening go to the store and purchase about 1.25 mBTC worth of groceries.

Hey, don't get carried away. There were 15 orphaned blocks until the 0.7 chain caught up and became the main chain again.

You can pay bills in coins. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:43:13
your wallet.dat contains not your bitcoin, but only the information needed to prove that you are the owner of the bitcoin addresses you own. This information is the "private key".
The blockchain is a public ledger that tracks which address has how many coins. In order to send money from an address, you must sign the transaction with the private key of that address.
Keep your wallet.dat encrypted and backed up. Make sure to update the backups after every few transactions, because when you send some bitcoin from address X to address Y, the change is sent to a newly generated address Z, which is in your wallet. You Bitcoin-qt wallet contains 100 pre-generated addresses to be used to send the change to. This means that you have to refresh your backup at the very least every 100 outgoing transactions.
If you lose the private key to an address, there is absolutely no way of ever getting it back, consider it a donation to all other bitcoin users, because by taking your coins out of circulation forever you are increasing the value of those in circulation by increasing scarcity.

Listen to me.
All you need to do is install Bitcoin-qt, put your wallet.dat into c:\Users\&lt;yourwindowsloginhere&gt;\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin\, run Bitcoin-qt and wait for it to sync.
If the funds were indeed transferred to an address that is in your wallet.dat, you will have it. You don't have to be on the network to receive funds. The blockchain is nothing but a public ledger of where bitcoin is transferred to and from. There is only one blockchain, and if the transaction is in there, you will see your money as soon as your client syncs up.
PS Make sure you use the latest client from bitcoin.org, version 0.8. It is leaps and bounds faster than 0.7 with regards to syncing.

Hold up. Why is the growth unsustainable? The rise in price is based on the fact that availability is increasing at 50 BTC per minute while the demand is increasing at thousands of people per minute who are finding out about bitcoin just now and seeing all these articles from economists saying THIS IS HUGE.
Simple market forces, no?

Bribing officials to ban bitcoin transactions under some pretense. Otherwise you get caged. Or shot.
@_date: 2013-03-25 00:44:16


Wrong, dollar bills *have* a unique number associated with them. They are not *represented* as a unique number.
Bitcoins, unlike dollar bills, are nothing more than a counter on a specific address. Possessing an address is nothing but possessing *knowledge of the private key paired with the address*.
Stealing a private key is not like stealing a dollar bill, it's more like stealing a password. I guess the crime would be "unauthorized access".
@_date: 2013-04-02 19:24:36

What would a law say? You can't accept bitcoins because bad people also use them? I mean they can't state that the real reason for the ban is lack of control over it.

It's not the protocol, it's market forces that would do this.
You could ask the same thing about any finite commodity, the answer would be the same.
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:47:19
A wallet is a collection of bitcoin addresses (public keys) and their respective private keys.
There is nothing else in your wallet file. There is no money in your wallet. There is only the blockchain (a public ledger) that says "this amount went from address X to address Y", and if you analyze the blockchain from the beginning, you know how much is at each bitcoin address.
Due to this, all balances are public. Here is an example: 
You can see all transactions and the final amount on any address. (That's my receiving address, if anyone wants to donate by the way).
@_date: 2013-04-07 14:54:18

I think I read something related on reddit about a month ago. Something about storing digital data in DNA sequence.
@_date: 2013-03-08 18:17:05
Well, no.
If it's a valid address - it **does** have a corresponding private key. It's just that nobody knows what it is and it's improbable to guess it, same as it is improbable to guess your private key for your regular usable address.
@_date: 2013-04-04 20:12:30
I believe the question can be rephrased as "what is causing the skyrocketing demand for bitcoins?"
@_date: 2013-03-18 15:35:28
That's possible - but! I would think that anyone in possession of a large amount of coins already sold off a little bit for living expenses, which would have required them to get verified a long time ago.
@_date: 2013-03-12 16:03:43

I don't understand why the author keeps saying "the blockchains merged".
0.8 fork was abandoned and left behind. When the 0.7 fork became longer than the 0.8 fork, 0.8 clients and miners switched to the 0.7 fork automatically, ensuring its place as the "correct" fork.

Stop gambling. That's what to do. What is lost is lost, and the sooner you come to terms with the fact that you will never win it back and will lose anything you put into it, the better for you.
Again. Stop gambling.

You might want to familiarize yourself with bitcoin fundamentals.
For instance, your wallet does not contain coins, but merely keys allowing you to sign a transaction.
@_date: 2013-03-13 21:08:54


And thus a higher price because the demand is there. It's a positive feedback loop.
@_date: 2013-03-25 17:54:01
You could double-spend it (send the same transaction again) but add a fee  this time. It would get picked up very quickly.
Now, I couldn't find an easy source of info on how to do this yet.
@_date: 2013-04-06 01:49:20
I was so grateful for that one.
@_date: 2013-04-01 17:09:32
It doesn't really matter. However, due to limited supply, the price sort of reflects the adoption.
@_date: 2013-04-05 11:44:24
Can we get them off the pool, or switch to another pool?  How do we get in touch with asicminer? 
@_date: 2013-04-07 23:08:00
Wait.. What 6%? You mean 0.6% trade fee on mtgox?
@_date: 2013-03-27 17:56:13
But it really is.
@_date: 2013-03-17 22:34:30
There is only one blockchain, and it's fully compatible with 0.7. The 0.8 forked blockchain has been adandoned. Your client is not and cannot be at fault right now.
You probably sent a transaction with 0 fees and miners don't want to pick it up.
Now, give us the tx id and we'll be able to tell you more about it. You can find it by right clicking on the transaction in bitcoin-qt and going to "show transaction details".
@_date: 2013-03-22 03:13:18
Exactly. The demand will not let down. I know I'm buying all I possibly can if it dips to $6.

@_date: 2013-04-02 19:35:28


Except for the fact that it is finite, thus scarce, thus unlikely to just lose value all of a sudden, because ultimately value of anything hinges on what other people value it at.
If people value it as an investment - it's an investment.
@_date: 2013-03-07 18:28:41
I think media publicity has raised demand enough that it will never back down to $20 due to inherent scarcity. We might see $100 next month.
