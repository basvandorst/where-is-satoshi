He should team up with Terry Davis.

Coinbase did something similar to me. I tried buying some bitcoin with my connected bank account and the next day I got a notice saying that the transaction had been cancelled. I contacted support and their vague answer was that I wasn't eligible to buy or sell bitcoin through the Coinbase platform. No further explanation. I had been a customer since 2013 and I probably had less than 10 transactions through them. So I sent my .004 btc elsewhere and closed my account.

How would you get it back?

Wrong crowd. I feel your pain :P
@_date: 2014-06-27 09:57:05
Then it's a good scam.
@_date: 2014-09-24 22:55:54
You can get Bitcoins pretty much instantly using virwox, and use a debit card to boot. But I believe the fees are insane.

I'm in a bad mood. And I don't care about downvotes anymore.

I like bitcoin because you don't need a bank. And I hate banks because it takes 3 business days to confirm a transaction! In 2014!

Thanks, Data.
@_date: 2014-08-03 18:02:17
I'll try it :-)

Dogecoin? Seriously? Yeah, fuck that.

Not very good. ;-)

All of these down votes and ridicule are from people at MasterCard trying to make op an hero.
@_date: 2014-06-25 21:47:58
Nope. I just try to make shitty meta jokes.
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:58:45
I dunno, it can't be that uncommon because of, you know, the huge porn industry. 
@_date: 2016-03-28 09:54:05
What if you don't have one?
@_date: 2016-03-28 17:07:00
I *hate* it when that happens.
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:59:42
Hey I'm not saying it couldn't happen, but I'm not in the habit of trusting every story I hear on the internet, no matter how much it affirms my beliefs.
@_date: 2016-06-09 18:17:18
I'm sorry, as much as I hate the police, I have a hard time believing that they raided your friend's house for *absolutely no* reason.
@_date: 2016-06-14 15:04:04
Yeah, 20 years ago. So older? Not new?
@_date: 2016-06-14 10:10:12
Tell that to Chris Farley.

Good perception :-P it is a line from an old SNL sketch. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:48:26
Paying attention is so overrated. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 18:13:16
I know the feeling. I, too, spent all my bitcoins buying pills and heroin on the dark web. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:24:15
Like I said, it is overrated.
@_date: 2016-05-29 18:43:19
And I still say, 'never trust a hippie.'

It made me wonder why it is up to website operators to keep US connections out.
@_date: 2015-10-10 06:00:05
You're getting downvoted because you're essentially saying that people don't have a realistic idea of what their stuff is worth. 
@_date: 2015-10-24 23:05:22
Except no tracker worth using allows you to use legacy clients.

SWIM is stupid. Everyone knows it means 'someone who is me.' 
@_date: 2016-05-06 00:17:13
You shouldn't need it. The internet is one of the most reliable mediums for expressing sarcasm.

No idea, but I'd check in qtorrent's settings menu. Besides that, I'm sure macOS (ios?) has some way to modify default programs in *its* settings menu.

I dream about getting rich quick all of the time. Like just finding a huge bag of cash or something. Sometimes it's even a daydream. I think everyone has at least the inkling of a desire to know what it's like to have seemingly endless amounts of money. 
I was talking to my parents about it the other day, and they warned that I might not ever feel like I have enough money. And I guess that's greed. It's innate for some reason. Money does strange things to people, whether they have it or not. You're not alone and if you can recognize this "greed" in yourself you're probably going to be okay. Life is about appreciating what you have and not dwelling on regret.

I wanna get in on some BTCs!
