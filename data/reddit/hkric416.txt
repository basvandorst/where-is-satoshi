What do you mean? There's only one bitcoin. It's called bitcoin.

Did you see any of his tweets Dr. TinyDick?

Exactly, this "genius" is labeled so only because he's good at chess, math, and started a successful company. None of those three things is exceptional to the degree it is suggested. This guy is like the libertarian's Elon Musk (fuck him too). He supports Trump, who is clearly retarded and juvenile, and denies climate change. Yeah, real genius.

I was wrong, you are a shill.. :(

Are you retarded? How is Alibaba about Chinese people? It's a company. First you talk about it being racist to cricise the CPC because you can apparently make the blanket statement (which I know from personal experience is bullshit) that &gt; 2 billion people ALL consider themselves indistinguishable from the CPC. So what are you telling me now? That Alibaba is indistinguishable from the Chinese people too?

Lol right? If you ever let these guys not get away with their typical "Well the US is worse" argument, then they start to act like poorly programmed bots, which they probably are..

ok now that's starting to flirt with the racism line...

This is the right answer. I run a full node. I was very recently able to put in a 1in-3out transaction for half the economic recommended fee at a 10 block horizon, and my transaction was confirmed in the next block. I think part of the fee inflation could just be too many people paying more than they need, pushing the block average up. Doesn't mean that miners won't take lower. Remember, fee estimates are base on average fees payed per block. If there are a few really high fee transactions in a given block, it does not mean those fees are required to get mined in that block.

Ok, I got to make something clear to you. I love all people, including Chinese people. Chinese culture was part of my upbringing, and so was multiculturalism. I've been to a lot of places in the world, and people everywhere are clearly the same, and that is one of the strongest opinions I have, personally. The vast majority of people are wonderful. The distribution of assholes and asshats is consistent everywhere.  So you've really got the wrong idea here, somehow. Somehow you've pictured me as some alt-right white guy, which is kind of racist itself - but I can definitely understand why you'd think that. I've been on the receiving end of plenty of actual racism. I get it. But I remain firm:  when I say China, I mean the government, not the people. I detest nationalism of any kind. When I criticize China, as you've seen in my comments, I'm referring to the CPC. And you may be surprised to find out that I have a very negative perception of the US, politically. Please consider that you're a little over-sensitive to this racism idea. I know a lot of people feel the way I do, especially people in asia, and many CBCs as well. In fact, most of HK and Taiwan REALLY hate the CPC. That's not racist. And I have the same hate for the exact same reasons. I'm so saddened and disgusted, daily, by how much the CPC has destroyed Chinese dignity, culture, and standing. They are acting just as aggressively, nationalistically, and selfishly as the US did, as Japan did, as Germany did, as the colonials did. They are filling young people's mind with egregious amounts of hate, xenophobia, exceptionalism, and otherness mentality. I just don't understand how you are so supportive of them. I find it very alarming, in general, that criticism of China or the CPC is taken to mean criticism of the Chinese people. I really do hope that someday you will come to see that. I've been a reddit lurker for years. It's only after I've seen a very scary amount of pro-CPC and Russian shills and disinformation that I decided to speak-out more actively. So you're wrong to say I have so much anger, when in fact I have so much sadness for what is going on these days in the world. I'm filled with fear about the future of humanity. I see that you're not a typical wumao, you're not a bot, and you're not quite a shill. That's why I'm saying this here. Maybe you will see, I'm not the enemy.

Excuse me, but how the fuck is criticizing the Chinese government racist? How the fuck do you equate a government with a race? And, your other responses are insane too. China is not a dictatorship? By what standards? The CCP is accountable to no-one. I've done business in China too, and you're an idiot if you trust them to do the right thing. And as far as middle-class lifestyle, have you tried to use a vpn at all in China? Maybe you spend all your time drinking Tencent coolaide, but it was unbareable. 
Enjoy your 50c.

I don't need to get a job, since I own a business too. But you know what, owning a business isn't that special. It's pathetic that you somehow think it's important for you to mention "operating a business". Shows how much you need to reinforce your own self-worth. For you to think that OP was literally attacking Alibaba because they are Chinese as in race, then you must be one of those r/asianmasculinity losers who is just so noncompetitive that you can't succeed at home, you blame all your problems on racism, and run back to daddy CCP to tell you who to hound.

Man, you really have a thing for this racism shtick. Like what happened to you? I'm pretty sure I could have a comment history full of cat pictures and you'd still say it was racist. Can you at least try to be more original? Anyone can just turn insults around, and pull the racism card. I know you're a lightweight, but at least put some effort into it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:19:57
Yea, both are important. I'd even say freedom of speech is more important. That's kind of important if you want to a) know about innocent people getting killed or, b) be able to protest it. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:52:21
At least you have the FBI openly investigating the President right now. Imagine anything like that happening in China. Or how about what happens if some rich developer wants to buy the land of some poor village folk? Yea it happens in the US too, but they actually get paid a fair amount of money. Oh and another thing. Please name one person that was arrested in the US just because they criticized the government? I find it pretty asinine that you somehow believe that you have a valid argument.

I don't know about this. Last night I did a transaction with half of the recommended 10-block target in ECONOMIC mode from my full node (core 0.15.1), and it was confirmed in the next block. Didn't expect that..
