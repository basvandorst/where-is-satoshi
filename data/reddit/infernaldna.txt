When price low, we have, say, smile. But price, when price high, then, smile. Always smile price.

The real question is whether or not "bitcoin" will ever sound gangster in a lil' kim song.

I saw the increase as it happened and felt nothing.

Do you guys tell others about bitcoin? I have friends struggling financially and I know I can convince them but I'd hate it if they took a loss because they had to sell low to pay rent.

What’s as big as a house, burns 20 liters of fuel every hour, puts out a shit-load of smoke and noise, and cuts an apple into three pieces?

Is there a way to make Bitcoin a religion for tax purposes?  We worship the moon. We practice hodling and abstinence. We are so devout, we're fanatical.
