Bitcoin Diamond is an example of a future as it's not an actual coin yet it's traded based on what people speculate it'll be worth. Bitcoin Cash is an actual coin so being that I use Coinomi they don't trade futures. When the fork happened with BCH you would receive 1:1 ratio on coinomi since it's not a future but when the current fork just happened with B2X, coinomi won't match your BTC with B2X. If I had money on a market like binance that traded futures they would have.
There are ways to procure these funds though that were supposed to be matched in a fork even through paper wallets. And I'm inquiring on how to go about getting the futures I'm owed with my Coinomi private keys.
Also curious about how to do it safely as I have other crypto on my Coinomi and don't want to risk it being compromised.

That's what I was reading. The thing is I have a balance on my Coinomi of bitcoin and alts. I imagine the best bet is to empty it all first? Also I have a lot of things to get since the last thing I got was BCH and my private keys held bitcoin through quite a few forks:
Bitcoin Diamond, UnitedBitcoin, Bitcoin Hot, Super Bitcoin, BitcoinX, Lightning Bitcoin, Bitcoin Top, Bitcoin God, Bitcoin FILE
What do you suggest is my best way to go about it just doing it one at a time with a private key or is there a wallet that I could use that would support multiple?

I understand but having a balance in Coinomi only allows me to collect on forks that are not for futures. So for example when bitcoin gold fork happened I was compensated in Coinomi but yesterday when B2X fork happened I was not and will not be compensated as long as it's a future since Coinomi doesn't allow the exchange of futures. If I were on a site like Binance that does allow it I would be receiving 1:1 B2X for every bitcoin I had in my wallet on that site.

Both terms are relevant. The fork that just happened with B2X was a fork and B2X is a future.

It was a double spend because I used RBF on electrum to raise  the fee to try to get it moving but I'm sending it to my LBC account so if it's rejected is it going to stay in my electrum?

Makes sense. Appreciate the input. Do you know if CPFP would work on this?

Thank you sir

So it won't let me RBF again because it gets rejected would child pays for parent be an option to speed it up or am I just stuck now?
