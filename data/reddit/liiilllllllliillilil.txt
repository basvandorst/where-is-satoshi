Wiring any amount (I'm sure there's a limit, for super-large transfers, but that doesn't really affect the average person) in BofA costs a flat rate of 30 bucks. Much better than 1.49% if you're trying to spend lots of money on btc

In all my experiences, Gemini has better prices than GDAX (Coinbase-owned) by a few percent. I'm not veteran, though; there may be better options than Gemini out there

For all purchases over 200 dollars, the fee is a flat 1.49% for bank transfer purchases. Credit cards carry an additional 2.49% fee

No, Coinbase doesn't let you buy at a fair market price. They mark up the price a ton compared to other services like Gemini. Massive hidden fee. I feel scammed for using Coinbase

True. I am still learning within the cryptocurrency sphere, and still have to grapple with the reasons why prices vary so much between exchanges. Why would someone pay more for bitcoin if they didn't have to? Maybe it's lack of awareness of better alternatives, maybe it has something to do with region-related restrictions, etc. Maybe Coinbase/GDAX is the cheapest option in some places (I assume it isn't, in most cases). Well, now that I know, I'll buy and sell according to more sound research.

Maybe my main problem with them is their lack of transparency.
I was fooled into thinking they actually took 1.49% of my purchase. My calculations put the fee percentage at about 3.5 to 4%. I consider paying a premium per bitcoin is effectively a fee, even if legal speak or whatever doesn't say so.

Coinbase may be the most convenient, given their UI and phone application. But I wish they were more transparent with the effective fee that they take from their customers.
