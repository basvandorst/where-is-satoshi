The inference is the amount of pollution and consumption of non-renewable energy it creates.

He's Canadian eh, 
he was running his op from Vancouver at the time.
I was actually contacted by the B.C Securities Commission a couple of years ago but the rep was non committal about possible compensation.
Probably now due to the presence and impact of BTC it would all get treated very differently. But there's been plenty of wild west shit in the earlier days of BTC that made me think it was only frontier justice that could help.

Oh fuck, no I didn't but I just did.
He shouldn't be doing interviews anymore. I couldn't decide if I was insulted by the attitude of the woman who interviewed him or felt awkward for her.

I saw the folly of that firsthand on bitcointalk a few years back when trying to warn other users of a scam that a well established "trusted" account was running. Despite already having a thread from more than a year prior that comprehensively called out a previous scam he'd run (that had other users supporting it and with posted evidence), I was routinely ignored and accused of being a fraud...until 2 days later when he scammed them.
*also ironically yes, this is a new account.

I don't know if anyone takes him seriously anymore, but this is really indicative of senility and I take no pleasure in saying that.

Thank you for looking into this. I spent a lot of time and energy (and $) in the past getting the info I had on him but ended up calling it a life experience because of the ambivalence I got from authorities.
I have evidence of him defrauding others also. The kind of wealth this guy has stolen would be at least half a million by now in current value based on the evidence I have, but I'm sure he's regularly run scams on other people and most likely still is, so it's probably hit 7 figures by now.

He's the Noam Chomsky of economics. Great for historical data, compromised and increasingly irrelevant in current discourse.
