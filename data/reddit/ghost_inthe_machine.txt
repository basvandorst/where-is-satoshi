I have had no luck with Coinbase lately. Still waiting on them to resolve a case. Buying my coins now on gocelery.com For some reason they are not that popular but the service is exceptional. Had three successful purchases so far. Takes about 4-5 business days but they get the job done.

This happened to me since February, been contacting their support since, they replied but can't or won't resolve the issue. I have moved on from them since then. Strictly using Gocelery and Circle now. Coinbase actually explained to me that it is in part of their super complex algorithm. Anything that is too complex for the Admin is something I am not messing (Trusting my money) with. Coinbase will be MTGox soon, super complex.

They don't side with you. Bitcoin in particular is not covered under seller protection. You CANNOT use Paypal to receive money for bitcoins. This is what I know for sure:
Scammers get access to a users ebay and paypal account. (security on both sites is worst than shit)
Scammers use those accounts to purchase bitcoins you are selling.
After the actual owner of the account notices the charge they will file a claim with Paypal. paypal does not cover Bitcoins under their seller protection, even if you provide tracking or blockchain, (They lack common sense to decipher words). You lose the case after Paypal takes 2 seconds to review it. 
Oh you will also lose bitcoins you sold.
Stop selling them now. 
Go to localbitcoins, create account and sell there.

Well not the justice system, but Snowden did hit back. And the result is, he is exiled, people are on the fence about if what he did was a good or bad thing, he is facing jail time if he returns. I mean if that is the cost of hitting back then I agree with those that stay quite and go with the flow. Because the people you seem to want to advocate for will leave you hanging out to dry when all is said and done. Hey they might even call you a traitor.

Honest answer. Maybe it will. And I hope it does.

So the forum dedicated to bitcoins on reddit is unable to answer the question.

Does not tell me how to buy 10 bitcoins today
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:58:30
I guess reading isn't one of your strengths, I'll explain like your 5.
The account was never taken down. Since the account was setup back in 2004 there has always been a limit on how much money you can withdraw from it. This basically means you can tell your bank that no more than $500 can be withdrawn at any given time\per day. So now if someone tries to withdraw $501 the bank will refuse that automatically, I don't have to do anything fancy like taking down the account. The bank will then call me and notify me that an attempt was made to withdraw more than the limit that was set. Hope this helps you understand.

Coinbase has no support. I am just saying if it is okay to direct users to their site and actively promote it on r/bitcoin, then it is only fair to have users list their bad experiences with them on here to warn those that there is a legitimate risk of doing business with Coinbase. Instead of sending complains to r/coinbase to die
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:35:36
I actually did that before posting here. But I get your logic, warn no one, everyone fend for yourselves and find out the hard way.
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:36:48
Can you elaborate. Are you saying coinbase is the scammer, or that someone else is scamming me. These transactions were made by coinbase and are verifiable by the bank that they indeed are the ones attempting and successful withdrawing from the account. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:38:13
.6  Stay away from Coinbase. They will steal from you
@_date: 2013-12-17 19:31:06
It's funny how everything coinbase related is getting downvoted.

If someone withdraws money from your bank account without permission or reason and does not reply to four emails, I call that stealing. By the way it's been a fucking week, you might like their cock in your mouth but I DON'T

Bought a bunch of stuff from you guys, including the I7-3970X 
I was very happy with the service and also elated at spending Bitcoins for the first time. I will buy from you guys again. Really excellent service.

Not as much as your mom during last night sessions. Trust me....

False they did steal from me, they just didn't get to you yet

I am not here for the help, resolving a Coinbase issue with Coinbase is not possible. I am merely trying to warn users while some might promote it there is a risk of their experiences not going as well as others. I don't care how big their growth was, I just want my money back and hope others don't experience the same situation as I did. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:19:18
I don't know if this is proof, is there anything else I can provide that will better show this?
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:39:39
It's funny how you cannot ask support questions for Coinbase here but there is no problem promoting them here.

Congrats and hope this works out for you.

Blockchain has the bulk of my bitcoins. I just left a couple between the exchanges, it was like 1.069 that was on coinbase recently transferred from CampBX and waiting to be sold off at a better price.

Be very careful with Coinbase and your bank account. I sold some Bitcoins on Coinbase and they deposited the money in my bank account. No problems, about two weeks later my bank calls me and says they noticed someone trying to withdraw money from my account and they stopped it. I looked at the account and what happened was that coinbase made a second deposit for the same amount of money as the amount I sold the coins for (A duplicate deposit) Without contacting me coinbase then tried to retrieve the money from the bank. It was declined. I sent Coinbase an email asking them to contact me so we can resolve this and stop fucking with my bank since they are on edge. No response. I had some bitcoins left in Coinbase and these motherfuckers sold the bitcoins (Wasn't much) at a low rate (When the price was going down) and stll say I owe them 200. I mean we talk about banks being bad but Coinbase sees it fit to not respond to any of your emails, dip their hands into your Bank account (Chase really hates that shit) and sell your bitcoin for a price at their choosing. This is all because of a MISTAKE THEY MADE. I spoke with someone I know from Chae and asked them how to go about completely getting Coinbase out of my account. The guy said I gave them access with the account number, so I will need to close that account and re open a new account. I will do that by Friday and find out how to go about reporting Coinbase.
Now the money they accidentally deposited in my account - I was never aware of it until I got a call from the bank asking me to verify the withdrawal. I contacted Coinbase via email asking them to let contact me so we can resolve this and did say to stop fucking with my bank account. No response.
I know it is their money and realize I have to give it back, and understand they sold the coins I had with them to recover some of the money, but how the fuck do you not respond to 2 emails about getting this resolved and taking matters into your own hands.  
People in this thread seem worried about Chase, i would say worry about coinbase and banks.
They are equally bad.

Sorry did know that existed. Will move the post there now. Thanks

I was just checking Youtube researching different exchanges and came across this video. Thought I would share with the community. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:01:34
Them stop promoting them. I learned of COinbase on NOT r/coinbase
