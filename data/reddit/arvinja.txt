It does seem like there could be a [potential point in time where making big changes might become hard]( if I am reading this right. But the community will obviously have a huge vested interest in working together and to make necessary changes if problems arise, so maybe it's just a good thing that the protocol isn't left to some lone central authority?

Still doesn't necessarily make the resulting market "free". Unscrupulous people might be one result of the state withering away, we certainly have to be aware of the effect culture can have in shaping the future. We have to be prepared. Hopefully we'll have a free market though.

I am currently RTFM, and I think [this]( partially answers my question, it seems Bitcoin will work well even though SHA-256 might become obsolete. But I'm sure it's just failure of imagination on my part to not come up with some other problems that could cause problems, could those (unspecified) problems also be solved by some patching?

Through the power of the market. With anonymous transactions (Dark Wallet or similar on top of Bitcoin) withholding money from the government becomes trivial (almost barrier-free) and when let's say one NYC cab driver starts doing it, that cab driver can lower his/her prices due to lower costs and outcompete his/her competitors. Eventually everyone *has* to withhold money from the government to be able to compete, and that is when the state withers away.

Not really, it won't be free just because there's an incentive to cheat on your taxes. I'm just saying that this is what will happen. Bitcoin will change the structure of the market, we have no idea what will happen once the state can't collect taxes anymore.

Well yeah, that might be claimed, but *de jure* the principal of "innocent until proven guilty" is probably something the US justice system in general claims that it upholds, usually that claim is not made for tax matters.

I mean, this is the bitcoin subreddit so I suspect a lot of people here actually *do know* how tax systems work. But to those who don't:
That "innocent until proven guilty" thing you heard as a child doesn't really apply to tax matters, you're *always* going to have to prove you're innocent, and this goes for tax systems pretty much anywhere in the world. I mean there's a reason for it of course, it would be very hard for  tax collectors to actually prove wrongdoing for each and every case, which would get a lot more people to cheat on their taxes.
