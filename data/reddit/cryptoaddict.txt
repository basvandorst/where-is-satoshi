How big is the space for notes?

I only mine Scrypt..but considering how easy it is to change pools I have no idea why the f you guys are allowing this to happen. Whats so good about ghash?

To have each day in a readable size this round calendar would have to be very big. And even being so big it has very little space that you can actually use to write on. Am I supposed to write stuff in those small spaces for each day? And it would seem very akward to write at those angles too, especially if it's hanging on a wall.

So the ghash crew (not counting the pool miners) are 20% of the network? And people give such a player even more power? I'm confused. Does the value of their service outweigh the possibility of a 51% attack?

Probably waaaaay more to move that securely. It won't be possible to move all at once. 100 tons of gold is valued at around 4.8 billion dollars at the moment. I roughly estimate that shipping something like that would cost atleast 0.5-1% of it's value. Which is between 24-48 million dollars.

Yeah it's hard. You want to tell them to put everything in it but you know there is a chance they will sell at a loss on a -10, 20 or 40% dip. Only to loose out on a +1000% in a year or so. I don't bother anymore. I came to the realization that it's best not to give financial advice to people, especially family or friends.

Seems they are all waiting for 20k$ BTC before buying

It's true. Every single ASIC seller has been doing the same thing since the beginning of Btc. I don't think they actually claim anywhere that the machines are un-used.
