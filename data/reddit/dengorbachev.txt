Hi, I'm not a super-expert on the questions explored in the post, but I thought it was worth sharing the ideas. 
Please correct me if the calculations are off. Otherwise, enjoy!

Yes, I was going to run the dogfood node, too :) However, I can't imagine a scenario where payments would be routed through the node with such a small amount of BTC. Could you please point out how it could be useful?

Lightning Network is going to be used for smaller transactions, so that's why I took $5 for an example.
Also, thank you for correction - answered your comment on the blog.

That would be great! Was that an official announcement?

It's great to see you among the early adopters :) What's your use case?
@_date: 2015-12-12 03:06:12
Absolutely. But who will agree to run the first nodes?

You're right, the early adopters need lots of capital. So they can't be enthusiasts. They must be businessmen. That makes the question of adoption even more pressing.

Does A - B - C - D topology require 3 payment channels? Should they be kept open for a long time, to allow A to transfer funds to D at any time?

"role in the payment": consumer, hub, provider - any other role?
Closing the channel implies paying the miner's fee, correct? So the longer the channel is open, the more profitable it is?

Indeed, there's a major bug in the post that doesn't account for inflation. How would you fix it?
Also, answers to your points below:
* Bitcoin TX fees vary, that's true. Let's take one of the latest blocks ( In that one, a fee of 0.0005 BTC is pretty common. With the current exchange rate, that converts to $0.23. Anything wrong here?
* Yes, you're right, you still get the funds back. But while the money are locked, you can't use them anywhere. If you're a relay node establishing a channel with service provider, then you're locking up your money. They'll be spent only on behalf of users relaying payments through you.
* Absolutely. That's exactly what I tried to explain: the TX costs don't depend on networking and computing costs ("The cost of sending an LN transaction is close to zero. A little electricity is enough to transfer the bytes from sender to receiver. But the same is true for Bitcoin and credit cards.").
* (as noted above, a major bug indeed)
* I've openly admitted that in the article. Is there any way to actually calculate it?

Great explanation of the tech behind LN - but who will run the nodes?

If I understand correctly, no. To create a payment channel, you need to lock up your funds. If you open a payment channel for 0.1 BTC with Alice, you can't open a payment channel for the same 0.1 BTC with Bob.
