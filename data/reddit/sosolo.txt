Please do correct me If Im wrong, I only have a shallow understanding of how futures work but I have a loose theory.
If theres a 20% cap on profits on the contracts, would it not be smart to make sure that the price of bitcoin caps out your contract but not over the 20% since the lower the price, the easier it will be to pump it up until the contracts hit 20% again the next futures-period. If the price of bitcoin was higher then it would be harder/more expensive to manipulate it up to the cap during the next period wich could be a reason for keeping the bitcoin price relatively low for now.
Excuse my ignorance If Im wrong and I hope some smart people could shed some light on this!

When they say Bitcoin is aiming to be Gold 2.0, in a digital alternative global store of value they are then hoping that the generations ahead that is born into technology or is just now starting to earn their own income is expected to draw some % of the expected yearly investment/placement of value into gold, instead into cryptomarkets.
If even just 5-10% of expected yearly investments into gold went into crypto and +35% of that is in Btc then this expected continued inflow of long-term holders and buying-orders will keep the general flow of Byers vs Sellers in a healthy state creating a slow upward crawl.
I think this is what we would have seen if not for all big-player games. I think that Andreas is right in that the fight to kill crypto is lost, what's happening now is just a race between the whales and financial-institutions vs Regulators. A race to earn as much legally manipulated decentralized but locally sold btc and now with futures could periodiacally pump btc prices privately to raise futures-contracts value to their 20% cap that is held by their clients. When comparing to the small total market-cap of Btc it wouldn't take much to move prices during these early stages.
If interest and the expected inflow from people changing from gold&gt;btc long-term holdings continue and move the total market cap towards the cap of Gold. Then those predictions over long term is not impossible in my mind.
But what do I know, I'm just a random person on the internet.

Bitcoin can be used as an alternative store of value but it can also be used as a currency. Right now the relatively small size of total market-cap makes even "small" investments/cashouts able to move the price and hence we see the volatility in price. 
The higher the total market-cap of bitcoin and crypto gets the higher the stability in price will become and it would take more and more massive sell or buy order-influxes over many different global marketplaces to move avarage-prices.
Sooner or later people will use Bitcoin both as a store of value, as a counter-value to measure all other crypto and as market-cap rises it will become easier and easier to use as a currency.

Interesting thoughts! Glad to see that there are still some deeper thinkers around, thanks for typing all of that out.

I wouldnt say this is about price or speculation, this is about how normal human seasonal behavior can and have before influenced the market.

It's very different yes! I would say most institutional money have not moved in yet, small parts have dipped their toes. The rookies will learn in time that the new shiny things arent always the most durable. But then again some people arent looking for durabilty hence our diversed market. 
This is less a post about the price or bitcoin and more a post about not forgetting bigger picture things that will influence all of crypto space, like normal human seasonal behavior!
