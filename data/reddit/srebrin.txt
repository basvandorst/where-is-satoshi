which means working for state-enforced money is like being a slave who has to jump according to his master (politicians) wishes of how much fiat they require him to collect - the funny money they print and let loose for the slaves to gather in exchange for their "freedom". the current fiat system is a dystopian totaliarism where nobody has any real private, physical property but his knowledge and spirit, and it's all an illusion to spend your life and creativity chasing the funny money as the predominant and enforced by many regulations and legal tender laws for what form of money one can participate in the marketplace. fiat system is modern day human slavery, nothing less, nothing more

95%+ of the US Empire's economy is already electronic, based on funny numbers through credit and debit in not-so-secure banking computers. The ultimate power for governments is to make everything trackable and be able to revoke access to the market at a push of a button if they desire so... and they are working hard towards this pretty shitty future of total control! the next major uprising worldwide, and already in motion in argentina, venezuela, ukraine, thailand, turkey etc., will stem from the inherent corruption of the artificial construction of governments

i've been with a tour from beijing (google koryo tours) and there were at least 5-6 americans with us, and none of them had to go through anything more significant than the rest of us. the commies don't like journalists, to bring in telezooms for your camera and confiscate your passport while inside the country. since last year internet is available for tourists, with less censorship than china :-)
the biggest reason tourists go is to experience live the arirang games where some 100k people from the age of 3-4 and upwards participate in mass games doing amazing stuff, although at the cost of nearly a year in preparation for the event. expect to pay through the nose, on average 400USD a day being a tourist in an organized group, considering average salary is no more than 20-30usd monthly.

let me share my thoughts on living frugally in the capital of Bulgaria - Sofia, which together with some big sites accepting bitcoins could make living off of bitcoin quite possible at this stage:
- Rent of 50-60sq.m. in a nicer neighborhood: 200euro
- Food, including lots of fresh from the markets: 150euro
- Electricity/heating: 60-70 euro winter, 30-35 euro warmer periods
- Internet (optical, lan with speeds at 80-90mbit/s) + phone: 20 euro
- Transportation (metro, buses cost 0.5euro single trip): 20-25 euro
In Total: ~450 euro whereas average salary in the capital is 350-400euro, but most people live in their own places (90+% ownership rate).
We have a local exchange (bitcoini.com that works also with cash), the state and the mafia-politicians seem totally oblivious to the btc phenomenon and so far the ecosystem is growing rapidly; weekly btc meetups, btc-e.com is operated from within bulgaria by russian programmers and cofounders just as an interesting fact; plenty of low-cost airtravel to criss-cross around the eu-sultanat whenever the need arises. the time for btc wikipedia / travel seems like a logical opportunity for all those holding btc and insisting on using them whenever possible to push the velocity of transactions and positive feedback loop to accelerate

internet is used by at least 60% of the population and 80%+ among anyone below 30 years go age. the eldery will pay a heavy price, once again, as they are a very important demographics for the rulers to cater to, by increasing social (in)security to employ local slaves and other forms of tax burden that goes as a rule of thumb to the elderly and to the less productive in the tax farm.
@_date: 2015-01-24 16:21:30
what happens when the collateral for the loans gown down in value, as it did in bulgaria by 30-50%? or what happens, as is the case here, banks give loans to offshore companies with dubious collateral which is most likely a form of money laundering or outright stealing the depositors money through bad loans? in the local decrees by our rulers, they explicitly removed in 2004 criminal responsibility for unsecuritized loans, which was put in place after the last bank orchestrated robbery that devastated the country by plunging retirements down to $10 a month. banks are inherently unstable as few people get to decide how to allocate depositors capital and when banks are systemic for the tax farm to operate in this ever more digital world, they can expect in any case bailouts to save the matrix from outright collapse

I've been a depositor at KTB pyramid, for which i got paid an interest of nearly 9%, paid out in installment of 4 months. The pyramid advertised itself as the bank of the rich which probably was true considering that many from the upper echelons of the ruling parasites had "special" interest arrangements nearing 10-11% interest! I realized that in an economic environment of depressed credit expansion, outflow capitals, collapsing real estate prices (nearly 40% from the top in 2008) there is no way on earth they could possibly sustain this kinds of interest payments and kept my ears and eyes open for the slightest of troubles with the rulers as to move my electronic debt based money promise out of them. That is what i did just 3 days before the pyramid was closed in June 2014 as news was spreading that the pyramid chief - Cvetan Vasilev, was in a row with one of the ruling parties (DPS) which is famous for staying in power ever since the collapse of the previous rulers regime - the red communists turned into newly baked crony-capitalists.
The total assets of the pyramid were over 3 billion euros, of which within the "guaranteed" electronic money was 2 billion. In the so called guarantee fund there were less than 2 billion after 17 years of collecting fees on the bank assets, for which the rulers took on a state debt to be payed by the tax slaves in the next couple of generations as to fulfill the "promise". Bulgaria is in a currency board to the euro since 1997, after the hyper inflationary collapse caused by 17 failed banks (orchestrated of course) that run away with 2.5billion dollars of value at the time, only 7 years after the change of the clothes of the previous rulers to a new kind with fancier ideas like "democracy for the masses". This is to show that in 2014 only one of the nearly 30 banking pyramids operating in the country, stole more than the previous 17 failed banks in 1997. As interest payments were MUCH higher in all banks because of the distorted market place by the bankrupt KTB pyramid, lots of hot money was flowing from depositors speculating by spreading their eggs in higher risk tax farms like bulgaria, ukraine, moldova, mongolia, turkey etc. Now, all this money flow has reversed and I expect that more pyramids are in trouble than most people realize and probably unless the rulers take a lot more debt, there will be a contagion in the months to come as things unravel. The latest big bank to come into the spotlight is FIB (or PIB, first investment bank) for which news is spreading with a huge credit exposure to very few companies and persons with total credits way above the 25% regulatory limit of all assets. FIB is the 3rd biggest bank and already received state liquidity last summer (600million euro) as there was a bank run affecting them and other bulgarian-owned banks, considering how fragile the confidence level is with any of those pyramids.
What is funny the KTB owner is now in Serbia, as it is outside the EU empire and can not be extradited as easy as within it upon request. He has put a couple of a hundred million euros in companies in serbia, money stolen from depositors of course, and probably is under the protection of the serbian rulers as they seem to do everything possible to delay any extradition proceedings. Before the pyramid officially was closed, they boosted less than 2% default rate whereas in the other banks it is nearly 20% considering the real estate as collateral has gone down dramatically. Suddenly, after its closure the regulators at the central bank has published that it had over 50% default rate which was masked through new deposits coming in at the promise of high return and issuing new credits to the bad companies to repay bad loans and mask the whole think up! No normal wain person with leave his saved up toilet paper with any of the banks these days as there is in the air talks of overturning the currency board and hyper inflating the bad debt as they did in 1997.
tl.dr: whoever has any brains is getting his money out of any bank in bulgaria as the political uncertainty is too great of a risk

being ceo at some of the biggest online sites here we have been pushing bitcoin payments heavily since summer of 2013. i would say online bulgarians are now well exposed to the idea of bitcoin as much as western folks. we give away free satoshis to all our first time paying users as a way to motivate them to open their own wallet and start paying us back in bitcoin, which is giving them free access to our services if they use bitcoin with the giveaway :)

2. can not be stopped by capital controls
3. can not be inflated / deflated to fit a certain agenda
4. fully transparent ledger of how the money supply is distributed, whom has what
5. has much better privacy protection embeded
6. can not be easily confiscated
7. cash at the speed of light
8. would force gubmint to spend within their means as taking loans will be almost impossible in a deflationary currency
9. can connect the rest of the unbanked world, without having significant barriers of financial obstacles to a truly global marketplace through a protocol based currency system, thus lowering poverty worldwide
10. would make financing wars more likely impossible to do, as politicians would have to try taxing the chickens in their tax farm outright which is never politically sustainable
11. would make people and capital way more mobile, thus increasing global competition for both as to make gubmints more competitive focused on how to keep their tax farm desirable to live in and pay taxes instead of using destruction, deceit and money printing as the game in town.
12. since it's highly divisible, transportable, bitcoin will give boost to even further division of labour as now employing people at the other end of earth for whatever small task will be a nobrainer
13. first time micro transactions online are possible in a big way, which in turn will help with 
14. disintermediates lots of parasitic parts in the curreny system which enriches some being state santioned monopolies to the extreme, allowing them to corrupt politicians and regulators to put roadbloack to competitive pressure
14. is politically agnostic making people compete on merit, free market based transactions thus focusing people on how to improve relationships, transactions etc
15. makes saving for the future possible once again as in the current system the money printing banks and artititially low kep interest through bond purchases force people into riskier assets where sharks will easily bite them
