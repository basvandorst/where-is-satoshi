Yep, its premium purchase for sure. But I have sold 2+ btc there as an "investor" so people do use it. (Investors are those with BTC to sell.)  I personally wouldn't buy there. I buy at Exchanges where I move larger amounts of money in via bank transaction (ACH). For some reason there are those who dont/cant/wont do that... Maybe because of IRS/Regulatory invasion of privacy (coinbase) maybe because privacy (verification?). So, credit card options exist at a premium.

Try xcoins.io. Full disclosure. It is Beta at best. Buggy and bad support. But it does work. I have been an investor/BTC seller there in the past. Currently not investing because so much buyer fraud.

The fraud always comes from PayPal channels not other channels methods. And about 90 percent of the fraud cases where I lost BTC I was selling were people who actually had a criminal record. Not sure how to solve that problem. Well, actually I am sure. Squaretrade. :) 
If PayPal would recognize the Blockchain as proof of delivery and offer the same level of seller protection from fraud it wouldn't be an issue. 
I hate PayPal... but I know... preaching to the choir.
