EXIF is simply meta data. The thumbnail is a completely different section of the JPEG structure. 
Stop spitting bs. Thumbnail is completely overwritten when the image is edited in any software. Matter of fact, its a completely new image, with the ability to transfer the META, which has no image bytes at all.
At worse they could find out where he lives and beat him witha  wrench for the 100..

Absolutely correct. A machine completely offline, unplugged, with no ability to accidentally be turned back on, is quite secure.
Of course, your also also missing encryption with this method (I like more than the standard password wallet). I would simply encrypt the file or use a full hdd encryptor while also keeping it offline.
That way the only risk you have is if the machine or hdd is stolen, and even then the wallet or hdd is encrypted and impossible to use.
On top of this, I would keep a paper wallet / seed words written down and in a safe or secure place. That way if the risk does happen and the machine is stolen, you can still get your coins.
Backups, backups, backups.

This will never happen. That is your OS lagging, not the file.

Please becareful with these. These guys use to come on Activision sub reddit and post these same things. You get a "Free" wallet, but they charge you for the shipping.
Thing is, the items are so cheap, they make a profit off the shipping of between 5-10 dollars alone.
Ask yourself if its worth it. They got tons to fall for this when a few new games released over there

Stop using the machine right now. Shut it down. Please PM me asap from a phone or other device. Depending on how long ago this was, ur wallet is still alive

The following shows the format you should be looking for with multiBit Classic:
The following is what you should be looking for, for any other versions or file types:
// The format of the encrypted data is:
// 7 magic bytes 'mendoza' in ASCII.
// 1 byte version number of format - initially set to 0
// 8 bytes salt
// 16 bytes iv
// rest of file is the encrypted byte data
If you need any other help, pm me. I have been successful in recovering wallets for BitcoinQT, multibit, Armory, and a few more. However no promises of course...
