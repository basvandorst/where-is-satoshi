Oh yeah, because greedy people panicking trying to cash out in their reckless profiteering aren't to blame at all.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:53:11
You deserve all you get if you're real.
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:02:46
Yeah, because adoption of the Euro totally depended on it flying *wildly* on graphs. Mmmhmm, keep telling your self destabilizing a market is good for it, whatever helps you sleep at night.

I DRINK YOUR TEARS
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:33:32
You're missing the point. Shit like this is exactly why I refuse to hold on to this currency. There's no stability. No sane person would hold on to this stuff for longer than they have to.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:47:55
You should suffer for your greed.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:40:37
I haven't invested and refuse to invest. I have zero, I've never had any amount for more than as long as I needed to purchase a thing. Does that not sound fucked to you? This is neither a currency or a resource, your ilk have turned an otherwise awesome thing into a stock and I wish you grave misfortune for it.

Anyone who knows anything about markets knows artificial manipulations like what you're describing only forestall the inevitable, and many believe it exacerbates whatever impending drop is coming. Stop talking about shit you don't know you greedy fuckers. Accept that your desire to profit by doing nothing is directly causing these crashes and volatility.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:51:53
GREED WILL SET YOU FREE.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:55:24
Oh yes, because the attitude of using this currency as a means to profit and nothing else is *sure* to result in healthy growth.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:49:38
Oh the delicious schadenfreude I get from these utterly clueless replies.

I guess my biggest beef there is the assertion-as-fact that Glass-Steagall would have worsened the crisis and that the actual implementation of Glass-Steagall is the important thing there.
When people were shouting "Bring back Glass-Steagall" they were referring to a near 70 year growing collection of policies that imposed limits on what banks could and could not do, and typically with intent to grow the list of policies. I think most important among them is the prohibition of credit default swaps, regulated under GS and subsequently shielded from all regulation after the repeal, which I think have an analog to trading of toxic mortgages, one of the things that got the US into the total clusterfuck it managed. There was also the complete exemption of national banks from state mortgage laws after the repeal, which isn't directly tied to GS, but certainly came in the same wave of deregulation. The primary assertion I'd make was this attitude that the banks will monitor themselves and not fuck up is dumb. They get into trouble in the 80s, regulations are imposed, we have a relatively happy time in the 90s. Someone decides banks have learned their lesson in ths 00's, deregulate, we eat *so much crow* 8 years later.
I'm not going to go into arguing over whether or not it's factual that the continued existence of a very complicated collection collection of financial policies would have definitively resulted in a worse state of the US economy.

It's called panicking. Order volume is much higher when it's decreasing in a situation like this.

People like you are the reason I cannot hold on to bitcoins. It's volatile to the point of toxicity. I didn't buy, I refuse to buy. Your attitude is awful, all of this greed is awful and you should feel horrible.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:06:08
Your head is so far up your own ass you must be a highly evolved human being capable of sustaining themselves on their own shit.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:37:37
You should buy. Profiteers should lose *all* their money! :D
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:35:17
You're running to wild conclusions on what "regulation" means. Glass-Steagall style regulation is almost certainly a good thing, imposing limits on what sort of trades are allowed creates stability. Admittedly no direct analog exists, since Glass-Steagall mostly referred to stocks and securities as opposed to currency, but the idea remains that you can limit the types of trades people can make on a particular item and create stability. 
Just because the Ron Paul Internet Nerd Bucks Committee says "REGULATION IS BAD" doesn't make it so.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:52:18
 You are at the denial phase.
@_date: 2013-11-19 05:37:58
The instability only promotes adoption amongst others looking for rampant profit that doesn't create any value.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:56:07
Greed happened. Reckless greed. Did you expect things to be sustained?
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:37:06
You're right, trading traditional stocks and currencies doesn't happen digitally at all, high frequency traders just talk *really* fast.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:57:56
You're a wonderful person and making meaningful contributions with what you do in your reckless profiteering.

You should look up an NSL. tl;dr, anything secret they can do that is legally compelling entails not talking about receiving said compulsion.
The scariest thing about an NSL is there is no documented consequence for a failure to comply. It is understood to be "Very bad" though, and is basically a blank check to prosecute your ass. If it's *actually* a matter of national security (which most NSLs aren't if reports are to be believed) then you could be facing treason or sedition.
