it's the worst investing strategy ever. Because you cannot keep calm and ration always when facing huge volatility. Also, the investing is with high risk and profit, the risk tolerance is low when you in debt for the speculation.

I agree. What about the price? Like the short term price movement. I suppose there will be some market trend for some coins. what do you think?

News from [Reuters]( says  China wants ban bitcoin mining? what do you think about it?
@_date: 2019-04-10 09:52:02
Maybe because of the large energy and electricity consuming. China is not the only China to do so. It puts more restriction on it.
