You can get it here.  Thanks for the support!
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:04:20
And by the way anyone that has issues can email me directly at lamar
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:11:07
We are definitely looking into it but as for now we are focusing on extending to other operating systems first.

@_date: 2014-04-09 13:46:44
I am glad I could help you out.  Thanks for using the wallet. And thank you for this bug report.
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:37:18
That's me. :)
@_date: 2014-05-09 04:57:52
There is value in IP.  There is value in creating a network of users that work together.  Once you start forking  the network into similar cloned applications the network gets weaker thus lessing the value of the network as a whole. And because our goal is to get bitcoins in the hands of the coop we need to continue to retain as much value as possible.
 Even with obfuscation those with know how can still get it.  Because some people are trolls for the sake of trolling,  they could care less about the actual application, the people using it or us as developers.  They are just around to stir the pot.  They will never use the app, and have no intentions to try.  But they enjoy speaking in a sensational tone to sway opinion.  And those people are not worth sacrificing the mission for.
At the end of the day we are here for the long road and we busted our tails to create what we feel is the most user friendly application in the space and we want to continue adding value the way we envision it.

How does that explain them promoting, Coinbase, Xapo, and Coinkite?  None of which are open source.  Again if you know so much about code and can review it, get the chrome ext.  and look for yourself.  It's all there.  Many times people who want open source, don't know anything about source code and are then required to trust someone else. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:37:58
Thanks I am glad you all like it.
@_date: 2014-05-17 23:19:15
 LOL. Thanks!  I am glad she's such a fan.   And I appreciate you alls support.  We want to make it as easy as possible.
@_date: 2014-02-13 14:25:06
You are definitely right. There are some people who have done some malicious things with their chrome ext.  But we are a company that is focusing on building long term solutions for this cryptocurrency economy.

Real talk!  This may not be very CEOey of me, but thanks so much.  For this post.  We bust our butts to come up with new ideas, execute them and continue pushing the community forward.  This makes me feel really good man/woman.  This is straight love!  And we appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-05-09 02:40:40
I am a nerd and I also care about open source.  I enjoy supporting many open source projects.  But as far as nerds only using bitcoins, that's what we are trying to fix.  I gave my mother bitcoin for Christmas and she loves using the Pheeva wallet because it's a lot easier for her to use than the alternatives.   
@_date: 2014-07-10 03:46:04
No you will not lose your funds.  Your encrypted wallet is backed up and when you download the new app you can sync it.  Thank you for using the wallet.  If you need any other help email me @ lamar
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:44:09
We are happy you love the Pheeva Wallet.
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:26:32
It's closed source for the same reason Coinbase is closed-source, or even Bitstamp.  You will probably never use this application, so I guess it's not really for you.  And that's fine there are plenty of other great wallets out there and services that will probably fit your taste.  If you ever decide to use the wallet we will be glad to service you and help in any way we can.
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:02:34
But then they would need to be trusted. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 20:46:12
Thanks a lot.  That's odd.  Hopefully we get some worked out.
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:27:44
So do you use some sort of password generator like 1Password  that takes you away from the application for a second to come back and paste the password?  We've seen issues with that.
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:23:19
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:08:59
Yes it's a hot wallet I am working on.  I will be launching it pretty soon. Do you like it?
@_date: 2014-06-25 01:41:04
Hello, droidedout , my name is Lamar, lead developer of Pheeva.  Pheeva plus is a free addition to the Pheeva wallet.  The Pheeva wallet is a completely free.
@_date: 2014-05-21 01:21:13
Man this is good stuff Tyler.  
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:08:01
Hello you all, we are so sorry for the confusion.  We are hard at work trying to knock out some updates.  The membership will be free indefinitely.  We made it that way in the latest update.  If you haven't updated the app please do so. We are working out a lot of the small issues as we get requests from members of the Coop. Thank you for all those that are using the wallet and thank you for your patient as we continue to build the business.  My email is lamar  Email any time with any questions and we will answer them.
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:59:07
Thank you!  I appreciate the kind words and support.
@_date: 2014-07-11 03:18:00
If you send to a coinid, the app saves it for easy selection the next time.  Give it a try, and let me know what you think.
@_date: 2014-07-09 18:28:22
Oh ok gotcha.  Yeah we just do that so that you have a encrypted backup of your wallet.  So that you can sync it across multiple devices.  We are thinking about creating a  pro wallet in the near future.  But yes you don't really have to give us your a real email.  Just a coinId so that you can move your wallet easily between platforms.
@_date: 2014-07-23 14:05:35
We are looking into spots. The title probably should have read made for TV. We were so excited to launch that I also forgot the pesky comma between troll and please. 
@_date: 2014-05-21 22:48:40
Thank you very much for using and enjoying the ease of use in the application. 
In regards to private keys, we don't have any access to them. Private keys are created and encrypted before they are sent to our servers. 
The Gyft point idea is one that we hadn't thought of, and it's a good idea. We'll have to explore those possibilities and see what we can do.

Thank you Adam!
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:12:19
Would you like the source code?
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:15:40
@_date: 2014-05-09 05:06:11
Based on Fincen guidance, software developers are not considered MSB's.  We don't act as custodians for any of your assets, because we have no access to your private keys.  You own your own wallet and we provide the software for you to be able to transact with it.
@_date: 2014-05-26 03:04:30
Try it out again.  Open this link on your phone.  
@_date: 2014-05-09 01:34:43
The mobile wallet is primarily developed for the Cooperative.  By keeping it closed source we retain a certain amount of value for those members.  The coop trusts us because we are also members.  It benefits the entire coop, if we keep out those who would like to simply clone the application in turn muddy the marketplace.  This wallet is not for everyone, but for those who enjoy using it and have learned to trust us over time.  We are very early in this journey and those that stick with us early on, through some of the growing pains, will hopefully be better for it in the long run.  
At the end of the day we love people.  We love helping and working with people.  We also enjoy the freedom that bitcoin provides for ALL people.  We know why we are creating these solutions and will not compromise the journey, for the sake of a few people who could truthfully care less about anyone.
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:20:07
Another option would be for you both to get a Pheeva Wallet and use coinID's to send coins easily without  QR codes. ;)
@_date: 2014-03-12 18:37:49
We are actually only distributing applications to members of the cooperative.  You must first signup as a member through our trial. The trial allows quick usage, but once the trial is over you have to be a full fledge member of the organization to even use the mobile applications.  And If you are an android user we will be launching the wallet for you soon.  
@_date: 2014-05-20 12:32:09
I agree. Steve is a really good dude.  And this is awesome customer service. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:01:48
The one big difference between pheeva and coinbase is that we don't have real access to any of your keys.  We can't decrypt them because we don't know your password that you used to decrypt them.
Also as a dedicated hot wallet, with pheeva you only have access to a few coins that you'd like to use for spending.  Many people use coinbase as a sort of bank and your wallet gives potential muggers access to all of your savings.  One should look at pheeva as the debit card for your coinbase savings account.  NOTE: This is only if you are a person that keeps the majority of your coins on coinbase and not cold storage.
@_date: 2014-01-28 08:10:12
It will be available soon.  Just finished it up this evening.  It will be a full chrome extension.  All Keys are created on the client side and encrypted before I keep a backup on the server.  I never see any of it.  
@_date: 2014-11-19 17:07:29
Hey Casey, I'm sorry that your friend has had this problem.  Tell your friend to email me with the type of device and OS he is using. lamar  Some older android devices don't work really well but we are working on finding a good solution.
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:49:36
Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-07-09 17:15:31
The coop is still going to be going strong.  Actually we are starting the next phase of the Coop. So stay tuned.  It's going to be cool!
As far as the app conflicting it won't be a problem.  But you should use the app store version to ensure better updates.  
@_date: 2014-07-23 15:34:22
Yes that is where we'll air first. Thanks for your feedback.
@_date: 2014-08-29 20:13:18
Good stuff Steve and Jason!

@_date: 2014-03-16 16:23:09
Great work bitpay crew.   I'll be definitely looking into this for the Pheeva wallet: 
@_date: 2014-08-07 13:22:01
You can still get them in the Pheeva wallet.
@_date: 2014-09-11 22:31:52
Man, I don't know.  I think our wallet is great.  And we've been around for a little bit now.
@_date: 2014-09-12 19:24:34
And are you sure that the wallet you are getting on your device is the one that they have provided code for?  Like 100% sure.
@_date: 2014-07-10 03:46:57
We are in the process of publishing a lot more information about the Coop soon.  Email me, lamar and I will keep you posted.
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:46:16
We have zero access to keys.  The keys are generated on the device itself, and then encrypted by your password before being sent to our servers to back up. 
Because of this we can't help you if lose your wallet password.  If the Coop password is lost we can allow you to reset it.  But it you forget/lose your wallet password we cannot recover it because we've never touched it.
We are very similar to the blockchain.info application in that regard.
@_date: 2014-07-23 18:19:27
Thank you.  I found the bug because of this post.  We always appreciate feedback!
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:37:42
No we don't let you change the fee right now, because most transactions in this hot wallet fit with in the minimum fee threshold.  But that is a feature we are looking into.
@_date: 2014-02-12 21:36:18
Hey how are you?  The coinId allows you to pay each other using the id instead of a long bitcoin address.
@_date: 2014-01-29 04:03:38
not yet.
@_date: 2014-05-08 22:25:56
We are currently bootstrapped but would love to have investors.  We aren't spending a lot of time currently actively trying to get investment.  We feel our time is better spent building a great product, increasing trust and establishing relationships that will make bitcoin adoption easier for the masses.  If someone wanted to invest hopefully they'll see what we are doing and believe enough in what we are doing to reach out.
@_date: 2014-06-18 02:36:37
@_date: 2014-09-11 22:36:54
Naw, I don't think that's it, at all.  Seriously.  
Now if you had said sexy...... Yeah I'd hold me back for that.
@_date: 2014-05-31 23:21:40
We are working on getting more cards into the plus application.  This will take a little time but we are working on it.
@_date: 2014-02-14 22:44:11
Yeah It's really nice what he's doing
@_date: 2014-05-22 14:25:09
Believe me I understand.  We are currently working on a solution for those that are more bitcoin savvy that will be open source. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 12:43:01
Gotcha....... yeah the drive by situation I can see happening and possibly, when watching a commercial. There may be a payment address on screen that is faster to capture with your camera before it the image changes.  
@_date: 2014-07-23 20:24:06
Right now it's a standard wallet. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:33:39
If you got to the settings button on the bottom of the app there is a transactions section there.
@_date: 2014-07-10 03:48:15
Thank you as well.
@_date: 2014-07-09 15:50:59
Sorry about the confusion.  But now you can just download the wallet and use it.  We'd love to have people join the coop, but it's not necessary any longer.  Thanks in advance for trying it out.

Coinbase still holds your keys and you have no access. Actually a large web service provider didn't give keys either and everyone got goxed.  The argument you make is extremely loose sir.  Trust is trust.  
@_date: 2014-03-23 15:14:44
Hello Simon,  My name is Lamar Wilson.  I am the CEO and Co-founder of Love Will LLC.  We are the developers of the Pheeva Wallet.  First of all I'd like to say thank you for trying out the Cog Cooperative and installing the wallet.  Secondly I appreciate your questions and hopefully I can help you remedy any problems you are having. 
1)  All of the wallets are generated on the device that you are using. We store all of your keys encrypted on the server.  The application itself is associated with a cooperative. Therefore the mobile application must check to make sure the user still has a valid membership license. The mobile app cannot run without access to our license server.  With that said, we are currently working on an exodus address that allows you to export your private key, if you'd like to leave the cooperative.   The wallet also will be accessible from the chrome-ext without being apart of the coop.
2.)  The "Burn wallet" button has been switched to say logout.  The language was an attempt to be cool/cute, but was not good for users.  The chrome-ext will be updated soon to just say "log out of wallet".  
Essentially, logging out only destroys the locally saved wallet. But the wallet is backed up on our servers encrypted, so you don't lose access to your keys, if choose to log out.
 b.)  FAQs and more written support , like manuals, are on the way.  We are scrambling to keep up with the wonderfully overwhelming positive response, we are receiving about our first product and also the small bug fixes that have been found as a result.
3.)  The ability to import/sweep keys is something that  has been requested and it's currently in the "Git Er Done" basket for the upcoming release.
Hopefully I've answered your questions to your liking.  If not send me an email, lamar  Thank you again for using the Pheeva Wallet and more importantly for the feedback.
@_date: 2014-05-08 18:11:35
We are working on getting more info out about the coop out to the public.  We are moving 100 miles a minute.  We appreciate all the feedback, and will increase our transparency as we move forward.
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:08:00
There is no investment. What COG provides are memberships.  COG is no different than COSTCO, Sam's club, or any other cooperative corporation.  And it is free until the coop members vote on membership fees.  
@_date: 2014-07-23 14:51:47
Thanks.  I appreciate it.
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:21:24
This is great stuff.
@_date: 2014-05-13 20:01:24
When did this happen?
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:11:20
We haven't avoided the restrictions, we just learned to work within their boundaries.  We have a partner cooperative corporation, called COG Cooperative.  The Cooperative  licenses software from us, at Love Will, in return for being a sales organization for us.  COG distributes this software to it's members.  Therefore we were not trying to avoid Apple, but are actually doing the opposite by abiding by the rules. 
With that said Apple is Apple.  They can do, what they want to do.  We have no control over that.  We enjoy using their products and want to supply the best experience on IOS for IPhone and IPad users.
What we have control over is doing things that benefit the COG Cooperative, like providing certifiably crazy support, a great product and   creative thinking that will supply additional features to make bitcoin adoption and use super easy.
@_date: 2014-05-09 01:48:15
That's actually great.  But there are many people who don't understand cold storage and that leave many of their coins  with Coinbase. There will be many people that would like a solution they can trust without being really technical.
@_date: 2014-05-08 21:27:56
The funny thing about open source is that many people asking for it can't read code anyway.  So they would have to trust someone else to tell them if a wallet was stealing keys or not.  For us we want to build trust the old fashion way.  The same way millions of people trust Coinbase, Bitstamp, etc.

Thank you so much!
@_date: 2014-05-25 04:44:54
We will be pushing an update soon.  Thank you for the feedback.
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:09:36
We are actually introducing some new features in the next week.  These features will extend the functionality of the wallet outside fo the normal scope of the wallet.
@_date: 2014-06-26 12:34:10
We've submitted it on Jun 2.  And it's in review.
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:03:24
Hello, My name is Lamar Wilson.  I am the lead developer and CEO of the Pheeva Wallet.  The process of creating a wallet is pretty intensive because we use the bitcoinjs Library.  Creating the wallets in Javascript can be very taxing for the small processors.  We are currently looking into the issue.  Can you provide me with some more info.  What type of phone are you using?
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:10:20
Try this and let me know. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 20:15:50
We back up all keys encrypted on our servers.  We are a cross platform wallet, so if you lose your phone or want to open it elsewhere you can log in, and off you go.  We are actually working on a companion app right now to reveal your keys to you.  We have no access to them.   
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:05:51
Installing pheeva is really easy.  Just sign up for the Coop and download the app.  It's actually really fast and also syncs with the Pheeva Chrome Ext.    If you need anymore help email me at lamar     
@_date: 2014-10-23 02:38:21
What's going on, sister!?  Good article!  I need to get up with you, working on something special.  This is Lamar from Pheeva.
@_date: 2014-05-27 01:09:49
Hey how are you, you can now sweep paper wallets. And we've added a transaction history.  We try to listen to features that are requested by the cooperative and implement them as quickly as we can.  As far as private keys we are working on a solution for more advanced users that will allow them to have total control.  Thanks for your feedback.
@_date: 2014-05-09 00:20:31
All the permissions we ask for will be location(for a feature we will be implementing in the future) , contacts (for simple contact sending in the future),  Camera access( for scanning), and  Reading and Writing to external storage( for future backups to SD).  We asked for these permissions in advance so that they wouldn't be sprung on you in the future. We are trying to make it super simple to use bitcoin and we have ideas that will change that landscape.
@_date: 2014-05-08 19:42:54
There are Four great reasons to use the Pheeva wallet.
**Ease of Use**
Pheeva wallet is made for usability.  We made it easy enough that you could give it to your grandmother and get out of the way.  It's really that easy.  It allows you to transact simply and securely, and also uses coinIDs to help with the long bitcoin address issue.
We keep all of the secret things, secret.  The Pheeva wallet is protected using AES-256 encryption. This encryption takes place before we even store it on our servers.  Therefore we have zero access to private keys.
We don't store your password or  keys.  We also use SSL for all incoming and outgoing connections. Using SSL makes it more difficult to perform middle man attacks on transmitted data.
We believe in on blockchain transactions. Which means that every transaction made with the wallet is submitted directly to the bitcoin network.
The Pheeva wallet makes it easy to use your same wallet across several platforms. Currently we have a chrome extension that is for the general public.  We also have Android and IOS wallets for COG Cooperative members.  
By joining the COG Cooperative, you benefit from the use and monetization of the Pheeva Bitcoin wallet.  We are starting small, but we will grow strong by doing right by our members and working together to make the coop more valuable for all members.  Same boat, same future.
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:29:33
At first the board of the coop decided to charge for memberships, but then due to the speed of adoption retracted that and made memberships free to everyone.  That code was in there from one of the initial builds.  Sorry for the confusion.
@_date: 2014-06-21 20:35:36
We have submitted and are now waiting on review. Thanks for your interest!
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:42:20
We currently use two different servers. The all knowing Blockchain.info and a great new startup called blockcypher.com.  
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:48:37
We will not do that.  We have no possible way to do that.  You encrypt your keys before we even store them for backup on our servers. So you are as safe as the password you used to encrypt the wallet with. 
Thank you for the wonderful compliment.  We will keep focusing on creating value for our users.
@_date: 2014-07-23 15:28:41
:)  
@_date: 2014-11-19 21:05:44
spammy monetization?  I am sorry you feel that way.  
@_date: 2014-05-25 04:44:16
Thank you.
@_date: 2014-07-09 16:27:54
Thank you very much.  Stand-alone?   Like one that we distribute outside of the app store?
@_date: 2014-07-30 22:51:12
@_date: 2014-07-30 22:50:36
Gotcha.  We will definitely look into adding a deeper address book.  We've thought about creating an open api for other wallets to implement our coinIDs. Thanks for the feedback! 
@_date: 2014-05-08 23:59:45
Multi sig is coming.  HD is coming.  And if you really understand code you'd already have the code.  Anyone who understands the code can get the code with very little effort.
@_date: 2014-07-23 21:37:20
You hit the nail on the head this commercial is for Bitcoiners and people who are on the fence.  The mass market commercials are coming later.  Keep your eyes open. ;)
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:28:43
We put out a feeler for Litecoin, but really didn't get much response.  So we may hold off on Litecoin for a little bit.  Right now we are working on making it easier to get Bitcoin in  the wallet, and hopefully our users will enjoy what we are doing.  Thanks again for using the wallet.
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:03:56
What issue were you having?
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:54:35
No.  Pheeva is not open source but is built on the bitcoinjs lib which is open source.  We are also currently looking into to using the bitcore lib, a library sponsored by Bitpay.  We were in the Bitpay offices this week and really liked what they were working on.
@_date: 2014-03-24 02:52:23
We actually don't have your private keys, only the encrypted version.  You should try it out and register dreamofbitcoin as your coinID.  I'll send you some coins to get you started once you've done so.  
@_date: 2014-02-19 13:43:49
You can use this wallet to save quickly and easily.

You are correct, but we will not be selling our software to anyone.  And we market this as a true hot wallet.  Really just an everyday transactional wallet for making purchases around the web.   We hope that people will keep the majority of their bitcoin in safe places like paper wallets or secure hardware wallets.

And thank you for the kind words.  We're glad you like it.

I can understand your standpoint.  Bitcoin.org doesn't only post open source projects.  But I see what you mean.  And many of the closed source wallets are definitely for profit and can make transactions on behalf of their users because they hold the keys.

In the app display in the store?  Please explain.

We are actively working on localization.   Thanks for using the pheeva wallet.  We hope to have a few countries down really soon.

Thank you.

Early on,  We were going to charge for the membership but we decided against it.  We are receiving a great response and felt that we wanted to help with adoption by allowing the membership to be free.  In the future members of the coop will vote on how much membership fees will be.  
Our site has been the last thing we've updated.  That's why I believe there has been so much confusion.  We've been traveling non-stop as of late .  We've been focusing on usability issues for the members and the website verbiage has fallen through the cracks. 
For this confusion we are sorry.

We do nothing with your contacts right now.  We will never store them on our servers.  The contacts will only be used for you to interact with people you know easier.  We don't really store a lot on our servers at all about you as an individual.  You don't even have to give us your email, or name, only a coinId.  We ask for email and name, but it's not mandatory.  We don't even have access to your private key.
We make tools for the users to use bitcoin easier.  Our philosophy is to help everyone have more freedom with their own money.

It should be in couple of days
@_date: 2014-07-23 13:30:58
Thanks for that! :)
@_date: 2014-05-31 23:24:49
Hello Can you email me with more info about what's happening with your wallet?  Information like your email and coinId.  My email is lamar
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:30:52
That's good advice.  The developer name is temporary, it was for speed.  We are actively working to remedy the situation.   Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-19 18:47:24
I will look into that issue.  Sorry again for the inconvenience. 
@_date: 2014-08-01 01:23:10
Looks like Stellar likes the idea of CoinIDs.  Brought to you by the Pheeva wallet. :) 
@_date: 2014-04-02 13:17:03
Just watched the Technical Vid.  I was excited to see you using the Pheeva iOS wallet.  Good stuff, brotherman.
@_date: 2014-07-23 17:38:26
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:56:58
Great work!  Would love to help out any way I can.  lamar

Nothing stops us from doing that.  But a really great password will stop pretty much anyone without access to a Quantum computer from brute forcing your wallet and winning.  
In this case you'd have to trust us over time.  There is always a trade off between security and convenience, and we felt holding your encrypted keys securely helps us to allow a good balance between both.
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:09:59
It's there if you look in the settings.  Have you updated yet?

Hey everyone.  My name is Lamar Wilson, the developer of the Pheeva Wallet.  This IOS wallet and the coop were in development far before Apple banned bitcoin apps.  We are not in the business of being underhanded or sly.  We are actually trying to empower individuals, through a little known entity called a cooperative.  We want to give back to people and allow them to benefit from being apart of a great organization.
@_date: 2014-05-08 20:46:59
Yes,  there are a couple of ways.  The chrome ext allows you to get access to your bitcoins easily.  We are also going to allow full export of your keys through the cogcoop member dashboard, or an exodus url for those people that want out of the coop.  
@_date: 2014-06-01 00:11:05
This is great to hear!  Glad to see someone share bitcoin with new users using our wallet.  Thanks.  BTW  we launched our anroid wallet a little bit ago.  Next time you can send to them using your coinid's

The idea is to discourage abusive behavior by charging a fee for each individual insertion into the block chain.  Also by having a controlled APIkey, bitproof can aid in controlling misuse of the chain by limiting the number of submissions by a single user.  They could also charge their own additional fees thus adding to the cost to spam.  I like the idea a lot, it's the first step to a robot driven distributed notary.
@_date: 2015-07-25 19:37:17
So any use outside of bitcoin as Currency is abusive?  That's your argument here.
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:10:03
Yeah the site is down for me too. 
"The proxy failed to connect to the web server, due to TCP connection timeout."
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:46:52
LOL. Are we sure?  Hmmmmmmm.
@_date: 2013-10-17 01:36:19
Yeah...It should come back. But even bitcointalk was down for several days as well.  If you are a trader on btc-e, the inability to trade could be extremely troubling.
