*Mate this, Mate that*. I swear to god if I had heard that many mates in one place, the bitcoin wouldn't have gone to the moon but those fucking *mates* would have.

That's actually very stupid. I sold my Bitcoin weeks before the BTC Fork when I saw the price go down. I sold for, let's say $2500 and then bought again at $2000 while investing an extra $500. Now that $500 is going to go a looong way in the future! Basically, buy smart, Sell smart

If the value of BTC increased a dollar every time he posted this, we'd all be trillionaires...

My mom pressured me to sell. I didn't know that the fork was today, and so I assumed that the value of BTC will go even further down post 20th when Bitcoin Gold gets released. Little did I know that it had released today, which is the reason why the value went down. I've done this in the past as well, sell bitcoin before it's about to get forked, then buy it again when its value has decreased due to the fork and profit. Though this time, due to my stupidity, I've lost $150 (If I had HODLd, I would have gotten $650, not $500). Lesson learned.
P.S: It's not really a loss, as I got about $150 from mining and it increased over time as the value of BTC increased. This means I've still netted a nice $350 profit, but it still makes me really sad...)

Lol, what? Dude, only 4 billion people have access to the internet, out of those, many of them are families, meaning it also includes kids who will not be able to invest in Bitcoin, and also those who either don't care about Bitcoin, or either those who do not know about Bitcoin. I think the number of people who use the internet, know about bitcoin, and will likely invest in Bitcoin is around the 1 billion mark. Out of the 1 billion, a lot of the people are from China, let's say 10 million. So basically, those 10% selling Bitcoin will likely result in a decrease of Bitcoin, most likely of 3%, i.e, $138, and this is exactly what happened (Price of Bitcoin dropped from $4.6K to $4.5K)

Yeah, except when they grow up, I'll likely be dead and the Bitcoin will go in the hands of my greedy as grandchildren. I'd rather sell than give it to anyone else. Yes I'm greedy, and I don't expect any less from my generation

My mom is a mother, so basically, my dad is a motherfucker. So how you assume there are only 6k motherfuckers?

What do you mine with? GPU or mining specific software? If you mine with miners, would you be please kind enough to download nicehash (If it can be done) and tell me what rate are you getting per day compared to what you are getting by mining directly? The main reason why I chose NiceHash to mine was because I didn't really understand how to mine directly. If mining directly is more profitable, I think I'd like to try that!
