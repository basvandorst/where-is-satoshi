So a few bad deals out of trillions of dollars of deals.  What's the probability of that?!  
The thing about contract law is that it's binding.

again - they have 2.6 trillion in assets.  That is 2,600 billion dollars. They have 2.4 trillion in current LIQUID assets (the other 200 billion is in long term assets and PPE).
If you don't believe me look at their balance sheet [here](
Do you honestly think that someone taking out $10,000 will affect them?  They are enforcing anti-money laundering laws because they got in a LOT of trouble for laundering money.

Bitcoin is no different than a commodity.  You could also do the same thing with gold.  
The problem is that one person could essentially accumulate a lot of gold/silver/bitcoin/oil and then sell it all at once and drop the value of that commodity.   
Anything that's [value drops 50% in one day]( is not very solvent.  
I'm not saying don't invest in bitcoin. I'm saying it's not a currency.  It's a digital commodity.  Its value depends completely on supply and demand... and of course on the rate at which new bitcoin is implemented into the market.

you realise that bitcoin is riskier than putting your money in a bank?

you clearly don't know what a futures contract is.  It is an OBLIGATION to take/provide PHYSICAL DELIVERY of a commodity on a SPECIFIC DATE in the future.  
Apparently you don't know what contract law is...
You never get *physical delivery* of bitcoin unless you get a physical coin.  Also, if you're referring about your "bitcoin wallet" as a key there still isn't a physical manifestation of anything.
I'm not saying bitcoin is bad - it's just no different than any other commodity.  Just invest in gold or silver or pork bellies...

what the fuck are you talking about? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.  
@_date: 2014-01-25 18:51:06
Tell me about how they work with it.  How do they gamble with your money?  They're stealing from you so you should probably buy gold and hide it under your mattress.

Of course it is, but there's this thing called monetary policy that protects it.  Say what you want about the Federal Reserve "creating money out of no where", but it's mandate is to *control the flow of money* and protect the position of The US Govt as leader of the free world.  
There's nothing behind bitcoin to say that it will retain its value.  There's just a limited supply and a high demand.  What happens what the supply increases or demand diminishes? There's no internal mechanism of control.

fine - secure is a better word.

You could also own gold or oil futures and it would do the same thing.

Is "chain of trust" an academic term?

It isn't a currency though; it's a commodity.  If you want to call gold and silver a currency, then fine.  A commodity is only subject to FX risk if it's traded outside of your national currency.  If you're American and dealing with BC/USD then there's no FX risk.  
The issue with using it as a currency is that there's no entity that regulates the actual value through CPI, inflation, etc.  
If bitcoins value will drop 50% in one day there's no store of value.  I would love to have an international currency, but I don't think there is a system in place.
Unless an entity like the IMF is going to regulate BC it will not work.  
The other issue is that *even if* **everyone** in the world started using bitcoin, there wouldn't be enough volume to go around.
Add this to the fact that BC doesn't trade on any legitimate market (Forex, commodity, or otherwise) and you can see why I am very skeptical of the future of BC.  It will only maintain its value of bitcoiners keep obsessing over it.  
If a country were to pass a law making BC illegal then the value would plummet.  I don't think any country would, but these are risks that no one wants to see in something that is supposed to buy bread and milk.

No, I don't think you're the one who doesn't understand.  The *guarantee* isn't the same.
To give you an idea. The volume of bitcoin is somewhere around $15 billion.  [Source](
The OTC commodity market is 3 trillion a month.  OTC Derivatives are around 700 TRILLION! [Source](
One totally eclipses the other.  They're not even in the same league...I'm not trying to diminish bitcoin, but if we're talking about guarantees then you look silly.
