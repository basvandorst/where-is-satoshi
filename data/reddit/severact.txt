This is true in PoW also.  Money buys hashing power.  It's actually a little better with PoS, as there is not economy to scale benefit.

I don't think BitGo necessarily convinced them that their solution was more secure.  They got into legal trouble over their previous cold storage solution.  Apparently, margin + cold storage is a recipe for a violation of Dodd-Frank in the US.

Oh right, my first sentence is not worded well.  I meant "each user account was associated with a separate key."  
I don't know if this is true or not, but someone else on another thread mentioned that for US users, they were provided with the third key (the cold storage one).

The point of the "vault" address is that once the funds are initially moved they can't be moved again for 24 hours (or whatever the period is).

It is a "commingling" thing.  The were able to satisfy the regulations by giving each customer  their own separate account (separate multi-sig key).  They could have kept the separate accounts all in cold storage, but then every customer transaction would require somebody to manually get the key and sign the transaction; which is not technically practical.
@_date: 2016-08-04 13:07:55
But then every time a customer makes a withdraw, someone needs to get the key from cold storage.  So it is probably technically possible, but not practical to implement cold storage that way.

Seriously, looking at in in hindsight, it sounds like junk. All customer funds are stored in multisig addresses, where the customer gets zero of the three keys, and two of the three keys are stored and used by automated processes.  Sign me up! /s

I remember reading an answer to this question a while ago from the developer of Electrum.  My recollection is that he stated the 256 bit ECDSA keys only actually have 128 bits of key strength; so adding more than 12 words (128 bits) isn't really helpful.

I kind of like the idea of issuing a new coin.  They can inject money into the new coin out of future profits.  If you give people a coin that has a value tied to the future of Finex, I think people are more likely to keep using Finex in the hope that they are repaying themselves to some degree.

If they are essentially the same, but PoS results in essentially no wasted energy, isn't PoS better?  If you can obtain the same amount of network security, for substantially less energy cost, why not do it?

When I read the case, my understanding was that the biggest issue that the court had with the cold storage was that all the customer funds were "commingled" in a single account.  The Dodd-Frank act prohibits commingling funds for margin accounts.  It was meant as a customer protection measure, as with traditional accounts, separate accounts gives the customer more safety (I think it maybe helps protect the customer funds during bankruptcy).  
It is technically not practical to maintain a separate cold storage address for each customer though. So they came up with their automated multisig system. 
@_date: 2016-08-02 16:34:48
That is true.  There is probably going to be significant currency   exchange rate exposure in both PoS and PoW though. Although the two processes are fundamentally the same, there are definitely some implementation differences.  I think the two biggest ones are:
* estimating ROI is a lot harder in PoW.  You have to factor in equipment costs, equipment depreciation, predicted network difficulty adjustments, etc. 
* In bitcoin PoW, ROI depends on the size of your investment.  If I have $5k to invest in bitcoin mining, my ROI will be negative.  With $50million, I can negotiate better equipment prices and better power rates, and I may be able to get a nicely positive ROI.  With PoS, ROI should be about the same for all miners.

Since bitfinex is a big account, it would make sense the bitgo wouldn't insert fees, on an individual transaction basis, into bitfinex transactions.  That would inflate transaction size. They probably just bill them once a month (or something like that).

People have been prosecuted for stealing bitcoin.  I can't think of any case in which a court ruled bitcoins "have no value" and then threw out the case.  The fact that bitcoins trade on exchanges for significant sums pretty much proves they have value.

There are a number of mixing/anonymizing services out there.  The attacker is not going to be able to cash out all $60 million in one go, but given enough time, and assuming the attacker is competent (which is probably a good assumption), I think the odds are that the attacker will not be caught and will eventually be able to cash out.  
There have been many bitcoin thefts in the history of bitcoin.  It is not that often you hear of someone getting caught through blockchain analysis.

How is it different though?  If I have a million dollars, I can:
(a) invest it in a hashing farm in a PoW coin.  At the end of the day, if I make a decent business decision, I will have converted my million USD into a million in Pow coin (plus hopefully some additional return I can get from the investment).  OR
(b) I can buy a million worth of PoS coin and participate in PoS. At the end of the day, I will have converted my million USD into a million in PoS coin (plus whatever return I can get from participating in the PoS). 
@_date: 2016-08-03 20:32:05
That is still a benefit though.  Reducing the possible rewards for theft will reduce the motivation to steal.

I don't think this is true.  Read section IV.A (legal discussion) in the case. I doubt whether they are registered even now.  The Dodd-Frank act provides certain exceptions from Commission jurisdiction.  One of the exceptions is that if the product is delivered to a customer account.  The commingled nature of cold storage does not meet the exception.  Bitfinix changed their storage practices to get within the exception.
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:29:48
My guess is that the "socialize loss" plan will not get implemented.  It sounds like a plane that the technical and business people came up, but when they finally run it by the legal/regulatory people, they will be told: "no, you can't just take your customer's funds."
@_date: 2016-08-03 18:46:59
IDK, but each user had a separate key.  So I think it is possible that they treat all the accounts separately.  I believe the accounts were legally supposed to separated; which is why they stopped using the previous commingled cold storage model.
@_date: 2016-04-13 13:04:25
Because all transactions in a payment channel require both parties to sign transactions, I don't think this is possible.  The person sending the payment would probably get some kind of "can't initiate transaction" error.

That ignores the reality of the order book.  If you but a lot of bitcoin over a prolonged period, you may be able to do so without moving the price much.  But if the buy-side order book is only 1000 bitcoins deep, and you dump 1001 bitcoins all at once, the last sell price will be near zero.  Will the price bounce back quickly?  Yes, it probably will, but likely not all the way.

I already posted a reply to a similar comment.  Other than maybe the fact that in PoW coins the expected return is less certain, they are essentially the same situations.

Bitcoin also worked when the development was centralized. The exchange rate is great, but the increase over the last couple years has been less than other coins with centralized development. Try again. 


Ethereum has comparable or higher total mining rewards, and thus the security is likely about the same or greater. It has much faster transactions. Decentralization? Bitcoin's miner decentralization, which is what counts when talking about decentralization, is not that great.

Yeah, I get that, due to competition, fees may be very low, but effectively zero seems odd.  Running a LN node requires that I: (a) tie up some funds, and (b) tie up the funds in network-exposed hot wallet.

@_date: 2016-04-06 23:10:53

Those are your change addresses. Each bitcoin output will eventually become an input for a subsequent transaction. So in that first transaction, your address 19MKhczSFX1w43kG3goDDJzC259HAWba9u had about .09 bitcoin in it. But you were only sending 0.027. So your wallet structured the transaction so that the remainder comes back to you as change. The 1HYamfXxGKhQA6DxmsKDe2eycjULKjrYh address is also yours.
Basically, whenever you see a one input, two output transaction like that, it is a very good guess that the second output is a change output that is going back to the sender. It is a little bit of privacy concern as everyone here knows that you now have at least 0.11 bitcoin to your name.

Mining power follows total block reward, not the other way around. Whatever the reward is, the hash power adjusts.

So what? That is my whole point. Satoshi was a single person that determined the road map of bitcoin.
Decentralization, as applied to crypto, means decentralization of the miners, and to a lesser extent, decentralization of the non-mining nodes. That is it.

I don't see an issue with the rich having more voting power. If you are doing PoS, I think it has to be this way.  Voting needs to be proportional to the amount of skin in the game.  If you give someone with a tiny ownership stake a disproportionately high vote, they have very little incentive to not mess things up.    
As to voting on multiple chains, that definitely needs to be addressed, and I am sure it will be, in any future PoS system.

You can't really say the "mempool would be empty." I very much doubt it would be. Lower fees would result in more transactions.

It would be really hard to enforce any kind of rule like that in the protocol. The mempool is not a uniform thing and each miner potentially has a different version. Secondly, a miner could easily get around such a rule by filing a block with dummy transactions.

You could encrypt it and store a copy of the encrypted text. You could also break the phrase into pieces - like maybe two pieces of 12 and store those at different places. I think the basic idea is that people in general are pretty good at security of physical things.

Decentralization in the decision making process is not the same as decentralization of the miners. When Satoshi was around, Bitcoin was highly centralized in the decision making process.

There is a significant difference between anonymity that is immune to advanced attacks and anonymity that is just a pretty good improvement over basic onchain bitcoin transactions. I don't think anyone is claiming that LN anonymity is as good as some of the privacy focused coins.

How can it possibly be *strictly reduced* compared to on-chain transactions. If I make 100 on-chain transactions from a particular address, all 100 transactions, including the destination address of each, are publicly stored for eternity for all to see. 100 transactions with a LN channel and only the initial and final state of the channel are publicly stored forever.


You are probably correct. But there also are a lot of situations in which the intermediary hop will not know those facts. 
LN provides significant potential privacy improvements over main-chain transactions. It is not like people are required to use LN. I don't know how you can say that LN is not an improvement in terms of providing people with options for improving privacy.

Yes, you need to lookup the fork date/blockheight for whatever forked alt-coin you want. Whatever your btc state is at that point, will become your new alt-coin state. Any btc transactions you make after that have no effect on the alt-coin. You do need to save your Treezor seed phrase though so you can get the private keys for the alt-coin.

It is hard to be completely anonymous. Even if you don't tell your friends/family, there are still tax documents, exchange KYC rules, your accountant, etc. All are potential weak points for anonymity. 
In addition, bitcoin transactions themselves are not very anonymous. Most people, when sending bitcoin to someone else don't realize that the transaction might have a change address that can give the other party information about the amount of bitcoin you still have.
@_date: 2018-01-03 15:27:46
The privacy concerns are real. Bitcoin, as it is, is just not great for payments to parties you don't fully trust. Transactions leak privacy. 
Say you have a single address with 5 bitcoins in it. You want to pay someone 0.01 bitcoins. The change address for that transaction will show 4.99 bitcoins going back to you. Did you really want to tell the payee that your wallet contains at least 4.99 additional bitcoins? Probably not.

I don't know, I feel like a lot of people have a hard time conceptualizing total block weight. Explaining it as an "expensive" section (transaction data and old signatures) and a "cheaper" section (segwit sig data) seems to help. If you explain it that way, people intuitively understand that moving stuff from the expensive section to the cheaper/bigger section results in lower transaction fees and more transactions in a block.

I don't think that is correct at all. For example, if there a lot more buyers than sellers, you would expect market makers to step-up and take the short side - and then hedge their position by buying bitcoin. So a lot of futures buying would lead to bitcoin buying, which is what you would expect.

Right, but they all IPOed at some point, and the fact that they are now worth $30 trillion is good evidence that they were/are not scams.


FB and Google both IPOed while in great shape, and never really fell drastically from their IPO price. Most companies do IPO while in good shape.


Google IPOed after the .com bubble. Amazon did fall a lot during the .com bust, but didn't really ever fell to its IPO price and recovered back to ATHs in 5 years or so.

Rootstock is a bitcoin Sidechain. Sidechains are another approach (in addition to Lightning) to scaling. So with Rootstock, you would send bitcoins to a special address, which would unlock the same number of rootstock sidechain coins in the rootstock network. You could do whatever you want with your coins on that network, and then when you are done, send them back to the mainchain to unlock bitcoins on the main chain. 
The rootstock network is based on ethereum, so you get all the programmability/smart contract benefits of ethereum. 
Rootstock uses a "federated peg" to perform the gateway function between the mainchain and the rootstock chain. This is not ideal, as it requires a group of selected entities to maintain private keys and control the flow of coins through the gateway. It is not trustless. In the tweet, Sergio is saying that when/if bitcoin is upgraded to allow for trustless gateway functionality, rootstock will be upgraded.
Personally, I like sidechains as a possible scaling solution. It seems more natural to me than LN. I think people will easily understand that I can send my coins to the Eth/Monero/whatever sidechain, do whatever I want with them on that chain, and then send them back to the mainchain whenever I am ready.

In that case you are good. Be aware though that aggregating all your accumulated UTXOs into the hw wallet creates the same issue with respect to leaking privacy. When you eventually do a spend with someone the change amount will be large and the person will know you control at least that much bitcoin.

What if the bug had been initially exploited by a miner to create a lot of extra bitcoin (say 500k) and the incident wasn't identified/patched until 30+ blocks had been biult on top of it? In that case it would have basically been the same situation as the DAO hack. The miner would say "the code is the code" and the rest of the community would have to make the decision of whether to let the miner have the new coins or create bitcoin2.

I am excited to see LN work, but I doubt it will reduce on-chain fees. If anything, it may increase them. I think the main use case for LN will likely be small and micro-payment type transactions (cup of coffee type transactions, as you mention). The problem is that practically nobody currently uses bitcoin for these types of transactions due to the high fees. They will be new use cases. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:24:16
Yes, it really is. Look at the mempool:
As I am typing this, over 1500 transactions paying 1000+ sat/byte. His transaction was 2587 bytes, so 2587000 satoshis would be reasonable.  He paid a little less than that, which makes sense because the mempool is currently more congested than last night.

Same BTC essentially. Technically, since the mainchain doesn't necessarily know about the Sidechain, the btc you send to the sidechain is actually just locked on the mainchain and a corresponding amount of sidechain tokens are unlocked on the sidechain (and vice versa going in the other direction). 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:15:45
If there was a change output back to you (likely) you can do another transaction that uses that output and pays a high fee. I believe most miners will apply the "child pays for parent" rules and consider the two transactions as a single transaction with the combined fee. I think the problem here is finding a wallet that lets you specify particular UTXO that you want to use.
@_date: 2018-09-21 13:49:21
If the majority of the network nodes, all miners, and all exchanges accepted the block with the exploit, and only old nodes rejected it, I think it would be really hard to argue that the miner is the one hardforking off (even if it is technically true in some sense).

It wouldn't have made much difference. It was a 12-input, non-segwit, transaction. He could have saved a bit by selecting a low fee and waiting, but not that much.

Doesn't batching mean that fewer inputs are needed per output? I think this would mean that, with batching, a smaller portion of the total transaction is signature data. 
@_date: 2015-12-16 16:00:12
I don't get the "soft caps" argument.  Other than concerns about orphaned blocks, why would a miner artificially limit the number of transactions they include in a block?  As noted in Charlie's article, from the miner's perspective, the marginal cost of including an additional transaction is almost zero.  They would be leaving free money just sitting there in the mempool for the miner of the next block to take.  
"Trying to gobble up as many transactions as you can will indeed result in a race to the bottom, but it's against a miners own interest to do such a thing, since the following batch of transactions will take that action into account and will thus pay a lower fee, resulting in a lower future income for the miner in question."  I don't agree with this at all.  In a free, competitive market, everyone should tend to optimize for their short term benefit.  Maybe the miners will collude to artificially limit the block size, but that seems like a huge stretch.  In almost every industry with low barriers to entry and strong competition, prices tend to race to the bottom.  Even semi-oligopolies have trouble artificially maintaining prices (see OPEC).

Pre-segwit, all transaction data had to fit in a 1MB block section. Segwit added an additional section (upto 3 MB) but only for the "witness" signature portion of a transaction. 
Currently, the 1MB section is basically filled in every block while the 3MB section is barely used. If you generate segwit transactions, some of your transaction goes in the 3MB section and thus less of your transaction goes in the expensive 1MB section. Additionally, because the 1MB section is currently the limiting factor in determining how many transactions can fit in a block, by generating segwit transactions, you help to increase the total throughput of the network. 
@_date: 2018-09-12 18:11:29
I agree that batching enables more economic activity per block. A typical batched transaction though should have a relatively few number of inputs (where the signature data is) and a lot of outputs. So a block with a lot of batched transactions will typically not be very big.
This 2.26 MB transactions is essentially the opposite of batching. It has a lot of transactions with many inputs that consolidate into a single output. That will produce big blocks.

The point of the article is that it is not actually free, and may even be more expensive than other brokers.
What if, for example, pressing the "Buy" button, at the exact same time, on Robinhood and Schwab, for 100 shares of MSFT, consistently ends up filling my order for $105 per share on Robinhood and $104 per share on Schwab. Sure, I paid $5 commission on Schwab but I paid $100 more in order costs on Robinhood. Not free at all.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:00:27
"That will be taken into account by miners as to whether they want to include a certain transaction or not."
A key issue with bitcoin though is that this is not really true.  The marginal cost for each individual miner, when deciding whether to include a transaction, is close to zero (the only real cost at all is the increased risk of having their block orphaned).  The cost of eternally storing and re-transmitting that transaction, though, gets externalized.  -

Can't this potentially help a little bit with the bandwidth/latency issue?  Assuming that full nodes should already have most/all of the signatures in their mempool, so they could potentially validate before having fully received the signature part of the block. Is that correct?

I don't know, I would like my wallet software to do opt-in by default (or at least give me the option of choosing the default).  
As a normal user, the main uses that I see for RBF would be: (1) getting a transaction "unstuck" from the mempool and into a block; and (2) if I hit send on a transaction and immediately realize it was a mistake, there is the chance I can undue it.  RBF needs to be opt-in by default for either of these to be useful.  In contrast, I don't think I've ever sent a transaction to a receiver that needs/wants zero-conf.

Yes. Eventually the unconfirmed transaction will get dropped from the mempool of the network nodes and your wallet will let you create another transaction using those inputs.

Instead of the transaction payout adjusting to match the miner's costs, I think the number/efficiency of miners will adjust to meet the transaction payout.  This seems like the more likely scenario to me; it is what we have seen so far.  Nothing guarantees that the miners will make money, or even break even.  
The big question is whether, at any given time, the set of miners that are supported by the transaction payout will produce enough hash power for the network to still be secure.

One advantage of a no-withdraw exchange is security is easier for the exchange (no hot wallets to manage). So in some ways holding your btc with Robinhood might actually be more secure than holding it with a traditional exchange.
Maybe it is all funny money on the backend and Robinhood is not actually buying crypto, but I think that is very unlikely. It would probably be fraudulent and the owners would be risking jail. They would also risk losing money if bitcoin rises in price. It would be much easier to actually do what they say they are doing.

 Also, the IPO was only a disappointment relative to expectations.

Bitcoin development in its early days was very much centralized. The more successful alt coins also also have mostly centralized dev teams. The monero devs, for example, do a mandatory hard fork every six months.

Relaxing the difficulty value, however, would cause non-upgraded nodes to potentially reject valid blocks.

Yes, it was a significant issue in the ETH/ETC fork. Coinbase was known to have lost money because of it (they initially ignored ETC, and when people requested ETH withdraws, Coinbase would inadvertently also send them ETC).


I think your best bet, in case of a BU/Core fork, is to avoid making transactions for a while until things settle down. With ethereum, it was possible to use an Eth Dapp to separate coins on the two chains. I don't think it will be as easy in the case of a BU/Core fork. Also, if you think a BU/Core fork may be about to happen, be sure to keep your coins in a wallet that allows you to export your private keys or on an exchange that you trust to do the separating for you.

*The number and experience of the core developers is vastly greater than the BU developers.

"Unlimited blocks" actually means the miners get to dynamically control the block size. The assumption is that miners will set it much bigger, but it is also possible they will keep it where it is or make it smaller.

Yes, when a miner finds a block it sends it out to the network. All the other nodes that get it should validate the block to ensure: it is syntactically correct according to the consensus rules for forming a block; all the transactions included in the block are valid; and the hash of the block satisfies the current PoW difficulty requirement.

BU doesnt have an activation threshold. The 75% value is what one pool suggested as an appropriate time to initiate the fork. So in BU, there is official signaling period and there is no grace or notification period. It just happens. 
@_date: 2017-02-05 14:56:23
Isnt the point of emergent consensus to give miners a way to signal for the block size they desire? BU gives nodes a much more dynamic way to change the block size. - either up or down.
Sure, a miner can currently generate a smaller block now, but they cant really signal their desire for smaller blocks to the network (other than by outright rejecting a large block, which only works if the miner has &gt;50% hash power).
@_date: 2017-02-04 20:00:27
Thank  you for the reply. So if there is no activation mechanism, does that mean that as soon as BU gets &gt;50% and one BU miner emits a greater than 1MB block, we will likely have a permanent BU fork?  
I am having a hard time believing this it. It seems to be such an amazingly bad thing to do to bitcoin.

It is not clear. If the blocksize gets to the point that it is bigger than demand, I would expect fees to go very low, so the total fees per block will likely be lower.

Maybe it is just a coordination/communication thing. 
I think there is a significant practical difference between the current situation, in which coordinating a particular parameter value requires explicitly contacting the other miners and discussing what value they all want; and the BU scheme in which the signaling of certain preferences are encouraged and integrated into the block coinbase text.

I think the theory is that rationale miners would not start the fork until exchanges, wallets, etc. were on board. I agree with you though, it is very shady. The BU "hardfork at any time and without warning" seems like a big FU to all the un-upgraded nodes.

You are correct.  The required fee to get in the next block has gone up recently.  
Most of the huge mempool increase in the last day or two though seems to be related to the large volume of very low fee transactions.  People shouldn't care about the mempool size, but for some reason many do.
I agree with you that wallet sw not handling variable fees well is a problem.  Hopefully that will improve in the future.

I just don't see much reason as to why a pool would intentionally do that kind of thing. If they really wanted to congest the network they could just mine empty blocks. 
One reason why a pool might legitimately mine low fee transactions is if they are getting paid out-of-band, by the transaction creator, to include the low fee transactions.

Instead of orphaning non-segwit blocks to obtain the 95% threshold, the more appropriate way to do it would be for miners to start running a different version of segwit with a lower activation threshold. It is effectively the same thing, but it feels a lot more legitimate to me.

The way things are going we arn't getting SegWit anytime soon. BU miner adoption is growing and is now over 20%. If SegWit goes live on Litecoin, LN for litecoin comes out and is awesome, and sidechains come out for Litecoin and are awesome, then maybe that will help segwit adoption for Bitcoin.

Theoretically, no. 
Practically, depending on the fork, you may need to be careful to avoid "replay" issues. So say you create a BU transaction and broadcast it to the BU network. Because the exact same transaction is valid on the Core chain, if your transaction is inadvertently or maliciously broadcast to the Core network, it will also be entered on the Core chain.

Of course the hypothetical is ludicrous, it is the underlying concept I was trying to illustrate.
I think we can rephrase the question as: does a miner mining an empty block negatively impact the ability of other miners to find blocks in the future? If so, than the miner's action of mining the empty block (as opposed to doing nothing and not publishing the block) negatively impacts the network.  
Do you agree with that rephrasing of the question?
In the case where the miner mines the empty block, the next difficulty adjustment will occur sooner and the network difficulty level will tend to be harder than the case where the miner does not mine the empty block. A higher difficulty level means fewer blocks will tend to be found for a given network hash rate, and thus the miner's action negatively impacts the network transaction throughput.
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:11:59
I think if BU gets 70% hash power and initiates a fork the exchanges/users will likely follow and BU will become the main bitcoin.
Personally, I like the core vision and experience level much more than BU, so I am hoping for segwit. But I prefer BU over the status quo, so BU is my second choice. I think the worst outcome would be that both segwit and BU stay stuck in the &lt;40% hashpower range forever (the bitcoin is done innovating scenario).
@_date: 2016-03-01 13:55:58
There are a huge number of very, very low fee transactions in the mempool (1-10 satoshis per byte).  They will probably never make it into the blockchain, and may cost the attacker nothing.  
They do make the mempool look really full though.  
@_date: 2017-02-21 04:32:57
All full nodes and miners should fully validate. Nothing stops a node/miner from skipping some or all of the validation step though and just trusting that whomever sent them the block did the work. 
SPV mining is the term commonly used for 'less-than-full-node-validation' mining. Some miners do it to save time, but they risk mining of top of a bad chain.

But they are losing out on the normal fees. With typical transactions fees per block over 1 bitcoin now, I wouldn't say it is very little.

The potential problem is that the security of the network (hashrate relative to the current cost to obtain that hashrate) should be proportional to the total fees (transaction fees + coinbase reward) received by the miners.  So while miner profitability is not really important (in a efficient market, it should not be much more than zero anyway), total fees are important.  Right now the transaction fees are a very small portion of the total fees.  That will have to change eventually as the coinbase reward goes down.

"Wallet" typically refers to the software that someone uses to store their keys, create transactions, and view their bitcoin balance.  There are a lot of different wallet options, including web-based wallets, cell phone apps, and traditional pc applications.
Core includes wallet functionality (or at least it did the last time I used it many years ago), but I get the feeling the most people don't anymore use the core software just to keep their wallet.  "core" more commonly now refers to just the bitcoin node software - it is the software you run if you want to download the full blockchain and become a node in the bitcoin network, and maybe even mine.

Mining empty blocks does have an ill effect on the network. It reduces total capacity of the network as the empty block is factored in to the next difficulty adjustment.
 For example, say 50% of the miners started mining empty blocks, total network capacity would permanently decrease 50%. In contrast, if 50% of the miners suddenly dropped out, capacity would only temporarily decrease.

This isnt even remotely accurate. If 80% of the nodes are running segwit but 100% of the miners are running BU, then the BU chain would continue on and the 80% segwit nodes would get kicked off into their own dead network in which no blocks are ever found.Random nodes have almost no power.

If you have some math available, I would like to see it. 
As an example of why shorter blocks may be more secure, if a malicious actor, with 1/10th of the network hashpower, desires to string together two blocks in a row, beginning after it finds a first block, the odds are 1 in 10 that it will be able to do it. Assume that the block interval though is 1 minute instead of ten. The odds for the same actor to find all of the 10 "equivalent" shorter blocks are (1/10)^10.

I have doubts as to whether your statement "miners do not control the Bitcoin protocol" is true.
If all the miner nodes "upgrade" to increase the block subsidy from 25 BTC to 50 BTC, and all the non-miner nodes do not upgrade, what would happen?  There would be no new blocks created using the old (25 BTC reward version protocol) - the old protocol would be effectively dead.  
A few transactions would probably get through to the miner nodes, and there would be new blocks created using the new version.  At some point, the the miner nodes would probably form direct links with one another and anyone that wanted to continue to use the new version would send their transactions to the miners.  Blocks would continue to be mined with the new version.
Correct me if I am wrong, but I think Brian Armstrong was mostly correct in his statement.

Because BU miners publish their EB values, it should be possible to determine the block size that will nearly evenly divide the hash rate in which half immediately build on the block and half don't.

From what I've seen, the most likely hypothetical of someone losing money after a hard fork is:

I fell like many people, and probably most miners, still want core and the core roadmap.  They just also want a near-term 2 MB block increase.  I think a  statement, from Core, to the effect of "in view of community feedback we are going to implement 2 MB limit," would be really well received.

Yes, bitcoin transactions used to be cheaper (a penny or so or even free). I'm not sure what you mean by "fast" though. Bitcoin is as fast as it has always been, and is the exact same "speed" as BCH. For most of my bitcoin transactions these days, I pay what I would consider to be cheap or moderate fees (10-20 cents) and my transaction virtually always gets into the next block.

It raises the block size.  The best explanation of it I've seen so far is from (an author of LN, coder, and someone who has independently implemented segwit).


(note that I'd much rather assume honest misunderstandings than misinformation :)
People have explained the signatures as being "separate". After all, it's called "segregated witness"! And we have, in the code, "witness transactions" and "witness blocks".
Even as a coder, when I first heard those terms, I thought, OK so a new node that supports segwit will download the old, traditional block, and then download the new "witness block" as well, and with both those things be able to verify everything. Because that's what it sounds like. And with that understanding, I can see how you can argue, blocks aren't bigger, there's just this... other new thing that wasn't there before, separate (segregated) from the block.
First day I started coding (re-implementing segwit in golang from the BIPs without looking at the c++ code) I realized, nope, that's not how it works. The "witness block" has everything, including witnesses. The new software doesn't touch non-witness blocks. The blocks are bigger. I have a script that will spam testnet and make 3.7MB blocks. It's not a 800KB regular block with txids and output scripts, and a 2.9MB witness block with just a bunch of signatures. It's a single block, that looks pretty much the same as old blocks with a few extra requirements, that's 3.7MB.
Whether people like segwit or not, (I have my nits to pick with the design, but I've coded so much that depends on it that I really want it to activate :) it's important to be arguing from the same page, which is that segwit is a block size increase. It's kindof a weird one, and kindof a hack, but as coded today, it's unambiguously an increase.
@_date: 2016-06-13 02:15:28
i don't really see why that is much of an issue.  Someone will get paid for the block that does gets accepted.  If a particular miner starts getting a higher portion of their blocks orphaned than they are comfortable with, that miner is always free to start limiting the size of their blocks.

Not really. Most hardware wallets generate the private key internally. If you want to use a hardware wallet and really, really want to be the one that generates the entropy you would need to do a "restore from seed phrase" operation and then enter a seed phrase that you had chosen. The hardware wallet will then "restore" the empty wallet.
In general though, I feel pretty confident that the hardware wallet designers do a good job  in getting enough entropy for the initial key generation process that I don't think doing it yourself by rolling dice is useful. I think some people like to do it just because it feels very satisfying.

BIP75 is not a bitcoin protocol change; it is just a wallet-to-wallet communication extension.  Nobody has to use it. I think stating that it "puts the whole ecosystem at risk" is extremely alarmist and premature.  
It can add value to the system.  There are a lot of situations in which it would be helpful to see a verified identify of the party you are transacting with.  If you want to be anonymous, just turn off the option.

Closer to zero is best when looking at correlation between asset classes.  A correlation of -1 means the movements are 100% correlated, but just opposite in direction.  Correlation of zero means the asset classes are independent, which is what you want.

The general concept is to create a transaction (with a large fee) that relies on one of the outputs of the unconfirmed transaction. Most miners will view the two transactions as a single unit so the large fee in the second transaction can compensate for the low one in the first. But until wallets support it, you cant really do it manually. Emptying your wallet should work - if your wallet lets you create a transaction in which the total amount includes the stuck incoming transaction. 
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:44:28

Not the OP, but I think the issue is that 1MB, 8MB, or even 32MB+ blocks are all very very small relative to the potential size of the market. In addition, cheap transactions tend to promote more use cases. So it really doesnt matter how big you make the blocks, if the coin is successful, eventually you will be in the same situation.
Look at ethereum, which has consistently advertised itself as having cheap, fast transactions and is aggressive about scaling on-chain. They have been successful and the result is that the amount of transactions has been heavily increasing (they do a lot more transactions than bitcoin at the moment). The result: steadily increasing fees and network congestion.

The result would be a fork.  All of the still segwit miners would see that block as invalid and would continue building on the other chain. When segwit activates, there are no "old rules" as far as mining is concerned. You either upgrade your mining sw or mine on a forked chain.

I agree that a USB stick isn't 100% safe, but nothing is. It is pretty safe though: (1) you can easily inspect the contents of the USB before putting it into the signing computer to determine if there is anything on the USB stick but the small text file that includes the transaction data; (2) configuring your OS to not autorun an inserted USB stick is not hard (assuming it is not the default mode).
\&gt;If bitcoin reaches its potential and this USB-to-ancient-no-updates-PC  trick is remotely popular, real damage could be done to the system (not  just to individual bitcoiners' net worth).

I've been able to get a python 2.7 script running to guess electrum passwords.  The bad news it is kind of slow; 100 guess takes a second or two.
If you want to try it, here it is (below). You will need to down load the electrum project from github. Find the 'keystore.py' file and add the code below; then run that file. First edit my code to replace the 'xprv' and 'xpub' values with the values from your wallet file. Also edit 'pw' variable to what you think is your password and the list possible_char_set to include all the characters that you think might be in the password. I am using a * to represent unknown in the password. 
In the simple example, the password is 'test'.

	pw = '**st'
	possible_char_set = ['t','f', 'a', 'b', 'c', 'e']
	numberPossibleChars = len(possible_char_set)
	numberOfCharsToGuess = pw.count('*')
	numberOfPossibilities = math.pow(len(possible_char_set), numberOfCharsToGuess)

	passwordFound = False
	while index &lt; numberOfPossibilities and not passwordFound:

I don't think there is any standardized way to go from a passphrase to a bitcoin private key. So you would need to save the particular technique that was used.
Brain wallets though are considered to be a very bad idea. Passphrases that most people consider super strong are frequently still very weak. Use a wallet that will generate a 12-24 word mnemonic code for you instead. The mnemonic code is like a passphrase, but will definitely have enough entropy.

That is not how it works. All bitcoins transactions have inputs that each wholly consume a prior output. You can't partially use an output - it is all or nothing.

Fees should (hopefully) go down soon, although I doubt we will ever see $0.10 or even $0.50 average transactions again. 
There are two significant factors currently at play that should work itself out with time: (a) segwit is active, which will increase transaction capacity, but it needs some time for people to start using the new segwit transaction format to get the capacity increase; and (b) hashrate has fallen significantly as a lot of the miners are mining bitcoin cash, causing average blocks to go from ~6 an hour to ~3-4 an hour, and thus significantly reducing transaction capacity.

But we didn't start with that. We started from the opposite - two chains in which the combined difficulty was too high for the hash power.

Latency is an issue, but I doubt it is much of an issue. At least in bitcoin, network latency isn't a significant issue these days. Orphans are rare.

It depends on the kind of anonymity you are looking for. If your goal is to have coins that are not linked to you, you can buy from a regular exchange and do it via tumblers or other ways (convert your btc to an anonymous coin and then back to btc).

The expected revenue of each hash is a function of exchange rate and difficulty. How "much has power is behind btc" is not really relevant.

I am not an expert as to why, but it is well known that an elliptic curve key of length n provides n/2 bits of security. I think the issue is that there are many different private keys (in the 256 bit space) that are all effectively equivalent (result in the same public key). The bottom line is that if I know your ECDSA public key and wanted to do a brute force attack, the attack would be guaranteed to succeed after 2^128 attempts. 
Bitcoin addresses are calculated as a hash of the public key. The hash provides an extra level of security, and it is one of the reasons why people say to not reuse addresses. Once you spend from an address, the public key is revealed and the extra security provided by the hash is useless.

If you are concerned about the RNG algorithms, you can make your own recovery seed. I think most of the hardware wallets are BIP39 compatible. The last word in a BIP39 recovery phrase has some checksum information. So if you are making a 13 word BIP39 phrase, you could pick the first 12 words randomly (e.g., by rolling dice) from the BIP39 list. For the last word, you would have to pick a word that makes satisfies the checksum.

In my opinion, decentralisation with respect to LN channels is not very important. What is important is that the protocol remain open source and that your counterparties don't have custodial control of your funds. In that scenario, it really doesnt matter if there are just a few big hubs. If one of the hubs starts to raise prices too much, people can easily close the channels and switch to another hub. Because barriers to entry are very low, it is reasonable to expect there to always be low-cost hubs available.

You are right. But the issue is that loan duration is at the will of the Borrower. So borrowers will try and borrow immediately before the fork and return the loans immediately after. 5% per day, for 2 hours, isn't much.
Now that the fork is past (I think?), expect rates to plummet and any borrower with a high rate will end the loan.

It is not a "51% attack" as this term is usually used. It would just be fork. It really doesn't matter whether it is 5% or 51% of miners.  Why would anyone follow that fork, particularly given the really high activation criteria for segwit.

It is because the emergency adjust is very extreme - basically only six blocks in 12 hours. BCH difficulty is currently about 7% of btc. After the next adjustment (today) it will be like 20% of btc. At the fork, it was 100% of btc.

There is at least one potential legitimate reason to rent mining hardware: Mining requires a large upfront hardware investment and can be risky as the eventual profitability depends on the exchange rate and on the hashpower increase of the whole network (both of which are unknown).  By renting mining equipment, miners can lock-in a guaranteed profit and defer the risk to someone more willing to take it.

Taxable events occur only when you sell. So proving whether you own coins or not is probably not much of an issues. I imagine the IRS wants to use the coinbase info as a possible audit flag. So if your coinbase info shows you bought 10000 bitcoins at $300 per coin and then sold 10000 bitcoins at $700 per coin six months later, but your tax return shows zero capital gains, you will probably get audited.

Yes, since difficulty adjustments are based on 2016 block intervals (except for the bch emergency adjust), that comes with the average block time.


It all depends on the initial assumptions, but typically within a few adjustment periods for btc. Bch takes longer and swings more widely, but eventually gets to consistent 10 minute intervals.

I disagree that this is life or death for Coinbase.  Like it or not, in the US, it is standard operating procedure for stock and commodity brokers to provide end-of-year tax buy/sell reports to the IRS. Bitcoin is technically considered a commodity, so I don't see why it would be any different for bitcoin exchanges. 
Maybe not this year, but at some point I think it is almost a certainty that all US bitcoin exchanges will be required to provide the same forms to the IRS. As long as all the exchanges have to do it, it won't be life or death for any of them.

I think if segwit makes it to 70-80%, and it is running on litecoin successfully and LN for litecoin is looking good, then there is a pretty good chance the other miners will eventually come around and switch.
Another alternate theory I have heard proposed is that if segwit makes it to say 85%, it is possible that say, 70% of the  segwit miners could collude and not build on chains that include non-segwit blocks. Just the credible threat of this could be enough to get the other miners to switch (or else not make any money). To me, this seems pretty unlikely to happen, but it is a possibility. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:04:48
Right, but if 100% of the miners are selfish, whichever chain was more profitable at time zero would have 10 min block times forever. The other chain would have an infinite block time forever (cause there are no miners left to make blocks).
@_date: 2016-12-28 15:31:06
This is not correct. The IRS considers both selling bitcoin for USD and buying something with the bitcoin taxable events. In the second case, they expect you to report the fair market value at the time of the transaction as the equivalent sell price for the bitcoin. If this was not the case, it would be easy to avoid paying capital gains by bartering. 
@_date: 2016-11-28 14:57:55
A basic assumption is that the mining field is competitive. From the perspective of a single miner, softcapping your block or otherwise not putting available transactions into your block is irrational, because the next miner will likely just take all of the transaction fees that you declined. Since the cost (to the miner) of adding a marginal transaction to a block is near zero, a rational miner should include all fee paying transactions that will fit in a block. 
Indeed, a year or so ago when the total supply of transactions was less than the network's capacity, transactions cost essentially nothing to get into blocks.

I don't know if bitcoin (or any other non-fiat currency) can really stop such disasters. The true failing of the govt in Venezuela is that their economic policies were awful, extraordinarily wasteful, and discouraged productivity. They have been trying to mask the government failings by money printing, which effectively causes a transfer of wealth away from the people  and to the government. But historically, governments have other ways of transferring wealth away from people or certain people (high taxes, simply taking of private property, indentured servitude, work camps, etc.).

A number of the major wallets support importing private keys. So you would import your private key and then immediately do a transaction to send the bitcoins to your hardware wallet. If you are really paranoid, I know Electrum supports offline transaction signing: so you would install electrum on an offline computer and create a wallet that imports your private key; create an unsigned transaction on an online computer with electrum in "watch-only" mode; and then use a USB stick to get your transaction to the offline computer for signing.

If you are using electrum, you can just randomly pick any 12 words from the electrum wordlist and it should work. Open your wallet by "restoring" it. 
The procedure is similar with other wallets. The main catch is that the BIP39 compatible wallets enforce a checksum on the last word in the word list. So for these wallets, you can randomly pick all of your words except for the last one. For the last you, you will be limited to the words that satisfy the checksum. There is reference code for BIP39, so it is doable if you have some programming experience, but probably not otherwise.

Not necessarily. Say the cloud miner charges a bit less than the hashing power is worth. In that case, it can be a financial win for the person leasing the hash power. At the same time, it can be a win for the cloud miner, as they may be able to deploy the up front cash in a way that makes them more money then if they had just kept the hashpower for themselves. 
There is also an aspect of risk. Investing in hashing power is risky. You have to guess at the future price of BTC and of the network hashpower growth. Leasing hashpower can offload the risk to someone who is more willing to bear the risk.

I see this a lot.  I agree that making blocks bigger will tend to increase propagation time and thus orphan risk. I have not seen much work quantifying the cost  though. My guess is that the "orphan cost" for a marginal additional transaction will be very, very low. 
In addition, I don't think it is a good thing if "orphan cost" is the only cost, to a miner, for including an additional block. It would likely encourage the big miners to create dedicated high speed links between them (even more than they already do),and thus disadvantage smaller miners. It would also tie block size to technical factors, such as network latency. Long term, the bitcoin model requires block size to be linked to miner revenue (which is proportional to network security) in some way.

Because miners don't act as a collective. If you mine a block but don't include a low paying transaction, you risk the next miner taking the transaction instead. 
Before blocks became full, this is exactly the behavior that was observed: there was pretty much never a backlog, all transactions were quickly confirmed, and fees per-block were close to zero. Why didn't the miners back then just not raise the fees?  
@_date: 2016-12-06 20:06:35
Right, but what will that minimum be?  Under something like BU, it will likely be a very low minimum transaction fee and a very large maximum block size, which in some ways would be great. 
But it would likely disadvantage smaller miners that don't have direct connections with the bigger miners, and longer term, as the block-subsidy goes down, what is going to finance network security?

Transferring your coins to another address that you control is not a sale for capital gains tax purposes.

I think your concern is overblown.

At most, it is a "like-kind" exchange, which would not be a taxable event.

Each miner, as an individual, can't set or raise fees. They can all collude to raise fees - but that is not what we want. 
As an individual, they can only choose to accept or not accept what is already included in the transactions. Given that the cost (to the miner) of including a new transaction in a block is very small, the rational response to more transactions is to include every transaction that pays at least something. "Limiting orphaning" is one of the criticisms of BU: big miners are will tend to form direct high speed connections with one another to limit orphaning and to allow even bigger and bigger blocks, thus creating an additional bearer to entry to new entrants.

Channels, in total, don't ever lose funding (except when closed). Instead, the balance of the channel just shifts between the two parties of the channel. 
So if the hub opened up a channel with the merchant, the initial state of the channel might be: hub 1, merchant 0. As people paid the merchant (through the hub), the balance of the channel would shift to the merchant, so at some point it might be: hub 0.1, merchant 0.9. At his point, the hub might notice that the channel balance was getting low and do on-chain transactions to close-out the channel and open a new channel with the merchant.

What if you found the next two blocks - why would you orphan your own block? What if compact blocks (or something like it) was working really well and other miners could begin working on the next block with only a few seconds of latency?

Definitely not between each attempt. My main point was different miners/different pools are not likely to have have work duplication even if they use the same nonce schedule, as the blocks that are assembled are likely to be different.
Also, 2\^32 is only about 4 billion, which is about 0.003 seconds worth of hashing for a modern miner. There are some other bits in the header that can be fiddeled with to increase the effective none length. I don't know for sure, but my guess is that modern pools are probably also constantly generating different candidate blocks/headers to send to the various pool members.

It might be worthwhile for you to use multiple wallets for your bitcoin storage, like a "main wallet" and a "gambling withdraw" wallet. Always withdraw from gambling sites to your "gambling withdraw" wallet. Always send to Gemini from your main wallet.

Yeah, the "land and booty" comment was more for historical context - it was super common for 1000s of years of human fighting.
I don't agree that an elastic money supply was required. Higher taxes, loans, and various measures of confiscation of private property are all alternative tools that governments have used. 
My main point is that money isn't wealth, it is just a unit of account for the wealth a country has. Money supply inflation is just frequently the easiest way for a government to take control of the wealth. But there are other ways, and when country's existence is at stake, they will all be used eventually.

How does an elastic money supply have much to do with how much war a country can wage? Actual wealth, as measured by its population size, natural resources, and know-how is what determines how much war can be waged.

It all depends on how much certainty you want/need in the transaction.
"Instant" transactions that broadcast to the network and have adequate fees eventually go through the vast, vast majority of the time.  Although not always.
Transactions that make it into one block are even more certain.  I don't know the numbers off hand, but it is probably like 99.9% or better.
If you want/need almost absolute certainty, wait for the full 6 confirmations (about 1 hour).

It is probably still worth a try though.  Coin Cafe isn't doing this because they want to.  They are trying to comply with government regulations/requests from law enforcement.

As far as i can tell, asicboost is more of an optimization than any kind of attack, so i don't have a problem with asicboost  per se. The patent issue is also way overblown. As far as i know, there is currently only one issued asicboost patent: the one to bitmain in China.
I do, however, have a problem with miners blocking upgrades to bitcoin because their chips dontwork with the upgrade. I would have been a lot more sympathetic to their cause if they had been upfront about it from the beginning and made clear they don't like segwit because it was not fully compatible with their asic.
@_date: 2017-04-09 03:34:20

There is no "opt out" for the receiver; whether a transaction is sent as RBF enabled or not is totally up to the sender.  But the receiver does have the option of waiting for the transaction to be in the blockchain before crediting the sender's account.

My understanding of Veriblock is that it is not company that generates the bitcoin transactions, but the miners that are mining on the coins that use the Veriblock system. The bitcoin transactions they pay are just an extra cost in the mining process (like electricity or hardware costs).

Why do you think tether is not fully backed? 
It seems like a pretty good business model: people send you USD and you issue a corresponding amount of blockchain tether; people send you tether and you send then a corresponding amount of USD (minus a fee of course).

You are supposed to tell the IRS how much you actually paid to buy the bitcoin and how much you actually got when you sold it. So the different prices at different exchanges are not really all that relevant.

It is just an optimization technique for ASIC design.  "Approximate hashing" is not new - I've seen at least a couple papers posted on this topic in the last few years.  The "increase bitcoin mining profits by 30 percent" bit in the title is junk.

The idea itself is actually pretty clever. When miners on the other coin find a block, they broadcast the block (like normal) but also broadcast a bitcoin transaction that includes the hash of the block. When deciding between potential forks in the other coin, nodes take into account both total POW and the timestamps of the bitcoin blocks. 
Requiring that the miners publish to the bitcoin blockchain makes long range, secret 51% attacks nearly impossible.

With segwit, blocks (witness + non-witness) data can be bigger than 1MB (4MB max), so it will definitely help scaling.  The non-witness portion is still capped at 1MB though.

A key security assumption of bitcoin is that miners, by acting to maximize their profits, are also acting in the best interest of the system. That assumption goes away when blocks are feeless or nearly feeless. 
A failed 51% attack now has a real cost - the opportunity cost of missing out on mining the valid chain. If blocks are feeless, there is no missed opportunity cost. As another example, if one block has a big fee included in it, but all the other transactions in the mempool have zero or very little fee, there is no incentive to mine on top of that block. Rather, it would make more sense financially to try and mine two blocks to reorg the tip and get the big fee.
@_date: 2018-11-16 15:29:57
You have it backwards.  When the price goes up, miners are more profitable, which incentivizes more miners to mine, which increases difficulty and reduces miner profitability. The opposite happens when price declines. 
Network hashrate follows price, not other way around.

I recall at least one case where someone had a corrupted database which caused their node to broadcast invalid old states, causing them to lose the balances in their channels (I'm not sure if they got it back or not). There has been quite a bit of work since then on allowing better channel state backups.
@_date: 2019-01-18 03:56:46
I think there are two main explanations for that:
1. newer versions of mining equipment are more efficient and effectively provide more hashes per unit cost. So as new rigs are introduced and deployed, difficulty can increase even if price is constant.
2. Miner profitability varies over time. Although  the long-term steady state miner profitability should be very low, the lag to get to that steady state can be long. As long as mining is profitable, you would expect miners to be continuing to deploy new equipment, even if the price is currently steady.

I have mine running on an old computer, so there are electricity fees. Many people use a raspberrypi, so their electricity fees are minimal but they probably had to buy the pi. 


I can still spend the money on LN, so I don't really consider it loaned out. There are not many merchants yet on LN, but hopefully that will change. I like to think of my LN money as being in a second account, sort of like a checking (LN) and savings (mainchain) accounts.
I think the main downside is that your LN keys are in a hot wallet (connected to the internet).

I had a very similar experience. I thought the end of 2017 into early 2018 was crazy and we were very likely to go lower. I did sell some, fortunately, but I held onto too much mostly because I didn't want to take the tax hit. My reasoning was: "I think it will go down, but 30-40%  for taxes is a lot and it probably won't go down that much." Oops.

They stated about a week or so ago that they should be implementing segwit soon, hopefully they will implement an improvement to their fee estimation at the same time.
I think part of the problem is that if transactions get stuck because of low fees, they get increased help ticket queries. So it kind of makes sense from their end to overpay in order to minimize their support costs.

The basic flow of cryptographic hashes are:
1. Take the input and break it into a series of fixed-sized chunks. Pad the last chunk if necessary to make it fit into the fixed size.
2. For each chunk, split the chunk into sections and repeatedly run the sections through a lot of basic operations (e.g., shift, logical AND, XOR, (I think a few others)). The idea is to scramble the chunk in a way that is impossible to reverse. This is the basic hash operation. You can find flow diagrams illustrating the flow of this bit. They are pretty complicated to look at, but boil down to the basic operations performed over and over again.     
3. Feed the scrambled chunk back through (2) with the next input chunk. Repeat until all the chunks are processed. The final scrambled chunk is the hash value.

idk, I run a LN node and would be happy to run at a loss forever. Plus, I'm hoping it helps increase bitcoin adoption. So even if I get zero from routing fees, I don't really see it as a loss, as I am hoping it will have a positive effect on the exchange price (which would benefit me).

This method only works if the robbers don't know how much you have, don't know you keep a second account in your hw wallet, and are convinced when you reveal the pin for the first account. Which I think probably covers most cases of robbery by strangers.
Given your requirement of keeping your coins with you, I don't think there is much you can do in your scenario. Some kind of time-locked vault service might work, but if the robbers find out you have that type of service, they might be tempted to kill you or keep you hostage until the coins have been transferred.

Miners with high costs - those that are losing money - will stop mining and the network hash rate will go down. The difficultly will eventually drop making it more profitable to mine. More miners will join. Repeat until equilibrium is reached.

A 51% attack does not allow you to print extra money or directly steal coins. The best you can do is double spend a merchant/exchange. So, for example, you could deposit coins at an exchange in a first transaction, withdraw, and then re-write the blockchain so that the first transaction will never get to the exchange.
Practically, if you have enough hashpower to perform a 51% attack, you are heavily invested in the success of bitcoin. Doing a 6+ blockchain re-write to steal is probably a long term financial mistake.

In the 1800s, the Tudor Ice Company was a dominant company that made a fortune shipping ice cut from New England to global destinations. The refrigerator/freezer was the end of the Tudor Ice Company and decentralized the ice business. I bet there are many other examples.

What evidence do you have that the refrigerator making industry is/was more profitable? My guess it is far less profitable. Margins on refrigerators are not that big and refrigerators can last a long time.


We are going to have to agree to disagree on this. Ice itself is the main wealth in this example. The tech did not concentrate it, it spread it out to everyone and magnified it. Except for the displaced workers in the Tudor Ice Company, everyone was wealthier.  


The evidence in this case goes the other way. Before freezers, wealth was hugely concentrated in the owners/investors of the Tudor Ice Company. It was literally one company! You can't get any more concentrated than that.

I think the strategy of using a hardware wallet that actually stores two different wallets is a good one here. Keep a modest amount of coins in the first wallet and your main savings in the second. If under duress, you give up the pin/seed phrase to the first wallet and the thief thinks they have gotten everything.
I know at least the ledger nano S supports this. The first wallet corresponds to your 24 word seed phrase, and the second wallet to the 24 word phrase plus an additional custom password. Different pins are used to control access to the two wallets.

Your suggestion of a Tails boot CD is probably better than mine. Now that I think about it, I am not even sure if there is an option in Electrum to import a single public key.

Each hash is like a miner buying a lottery ticket. It has a very, very, small chance of being a winner (i.e., miner getting the right to publish the block and get the rewards). The difficulty expresses the odds that a particular lottery ticket (hash operation) will be a winner.  
On average, we want one block to be found every 10 minutes. So as the total hash rate of the network goes up, the difficulty adjusts to make it harder (the odds of a particular lottery ticket being a winner are reduced).

It doesn't fully counteract it. Ethereum is going to a hybrid PoS scheme in which PoS is used to finalize checkpoints (say, every 50 blocks) and POW is used to create the blocks between the checkpoints. In hybrid-POS, POW is still important, but not as important, to network security, so POW miner rewards, and thus energy expenditures, can be reduced while still maintaining high network security. Your  would still apply in hybrid-POS.

Lowering the difficulty would temporarily increase transaction throughput, but eventually the difficulty would re-adjust and we would be back to 10 minute blocks.

If you define Ponzi Scheme broadly enough to cover bitcoin, then the sale of any collectable (art, stamps, etc.) would be a Ponzi Scheme. I think a key characteristic of a Ponzi Scheme is that there is an aspect of fraud involved: participants think they are buying one thing (e.g., a guaranteed 10% earning stream) but get something else (an undercapitalized asset in which there is no earning stream and the founder takes out money periodically for his own benefit).

Pre-freezers: a single company controlled a huge portion of the global ice trade. Virtually every ice cube effectively included a payment to that single company.
Post-freezers: a bunch of companies made freezers. With a one-time purchase, anybody could buy a freezer and make virtually unlimited ice year-round. Sure, ice is still not 100% free, but the per-unit payment goes way down. Fast forward to today, does your monthly budget include a line-item for the cost of your refrigerator to make  ice?

The potential blocksize was recently raised in August, although that blocksize increase is only slowly being realized and can only be maximally realized when all transactions convert to the new "segwit" format.
Beyond that, the current scaling roadmap puts emphasis on scaling by making more efficient use of the current blocksize, and then hopefully doing a simple blocksize increase further down then road when really needed.
There are disadvantages to just simply raising the blocksize. The bitcoin P2P network is very inefficient: every   block is validated and stored forever by every full node in the network. In contrast, it is likely that there would be near infinite demand for free or nearly free transactions.

Segwit did introduce a possible "any can spend" attack vector but was never a realistic attack and at this point is impossible. The attack vector was that segwit transactions, to pre-soft fork nodes, were stealable by anyone. So the disaster scenario for segwit was that segwit would activate, people would broadcast segwit transactions, and then there would be a massive, multi-week chain reorg back to the point before nodes commited to segwit. At this point, those transactions could be "replayed" and then stolen. 
It was never realistic though. Multi-week reorgs dont happen. And if they did it would probably be the end of bitcoin anyway. At this point, it would need to be a many-month reorg.

For a number of reasons, you are underselling the value of a passphrase. 
The attacker would first need to know you have a passphrase - which isn't obvious, particularly if your keep some coins in the main seed phrase. Secondly, as long as you keep your seed phrase in cold storage, the type of people that are likely to find your seed phase arn't necessarily the same type that would know enough to brute force a BIP39 passphrase. Thirdly, brute forcing a BIP39 passphrase requires finite field point multiplications, which are computationally slow, so even a relatively week passphrase will still likely provide decent protection.

A 51% attack typically means censoring transactions in order to take advantage of double spends. A 51% can't simply steal coins or change the cap. The only way to do that is through a hard fork - but you don't need 51% for that; anyone can fork with any amount of hash power.

A lot of wallets (including ledger and Trezor) use BIP39 to generate a master seed phrase as a 24 word phrase that is used to back-up your wallet. You could potentially use this list to manually pick your 24 word seed phrase (such as by rolling dice) instead of trusting the wallet to pick it for your. Unfortunately, it isn't quite as easy as just randomly picking 24 words, because in bip39  the last word includes some error correction coding, so you can randomly pick the first 23 words but the last word is limited.

That is basically my understanding of Steem also.  I don't think I phrased my question all that well that.  Let me try again.
The steemit.com site, as far as I can tell, is basically a frontend for the steem blockchain.  Who owns steemit.com?  I think it is just the developers, but I really don't know.
Facebook, reddit, etc. arn't valuable businesses just because they have a lot of users.  They are valuable businesses because they have a lot of users and are able to monetize the users via advertisements. Does owning Steem entitle the owner a cut of that advertisement dollars that can be generated by steemit.com?  If not,  I don't see any potential value in owning the steem cryptocurrency.

Mining is supposedly decentralized.  Anyone can mine, which is a huge difference between bitcoin and the the current financial system.

From what we have seen from the exchanges, I think it unlikely that they will list both coins without replay protection.

In terms of software development, I don't see a whole lot of evidence that centrally managed is bad. If anything, I see the opposite. Bitcoin in the early days was centrally managed. It did pretty well. The last few years, bitcoin development has been much more decentralized. The result appears to be an inability to upgrade. 
Whatever you think about Eth overall, the Eth pace of development is way faster than bitcoin. The same with Monero and really every other centrally managed altcoin (which is most of them).

Electrum supports the exporting of a "master public key" that lets the importing wallet generate all of your addresses without being able to generate the private keys.

Assuming they are not stealing, the exchange should always have enough assets to pay back everybody. It is a closed system. Think of it as a box where people deposit USD and crypto into the box. The exchange facilitates the ownership swapping of stuff in the box, but doesnt make anything new.

If all you want to do is run a node and verify transactions, you don't need a video card for that. You don't make any bitcoin though.

It's relevant because it is what the exchanges said. Even if they could deal with it technically, it causes user confusion. 
Also, it won't be as as easy to split bitcoins as it was with ethereum. With eth, you could just run an address through a splitting contract. There is no equivalent in bitcoin. I think the only way to do it is to ensure that each transaction includes at least one inpout that can trace back to a post-split miner reward.

I totally agree that is what should happen. But with BU signaling at ~40%, the reality of "segwit first then blocksize increase" is more likely to be "no upgrade to bitcoin ever."

I would just report them on my tax return as long term capital gains with a basis that is your best guess of the USD value of the coins when they were mined.

It uses a federated sidechain to do the exchange, so their is some third party risk. The hope is that eventually bitcoin will be upgraded to allow the exchange to be enforced by the miners.

Just looking at the last 6-9 months would be cherry picking a time frame that favored alts. I'm not saying to do that; just that a historical simulation that covers three years but omits the last 9 month isn't up-to-date enough to be worth much.


I've never understood that logic. ETH wasnt premined in the sense that the devs keep a ton of it out of circulation to pump up the market cap. It was a crowdsale. Other than the relatively modest amount held back for the founders and to fund the foundation, anyone could have bought eth on equal terms with everyone else. If anything, I would expect that type of crowdsale to suppress the price, as the buyers are just normal investors/speculators/enthusiasts that can and do sell.

I believe that multiple spends from the same address should not make the private key any more exploitable. 
However, each spend does require the generation of a random number. If the same number is used twice as the random number (which should never happen with good wallet sw), then your private key is exposed. There is a discussion of this issue here: 
@_date: 2017-07-12 12:58:13
Yeah, theoretically. If you look at that link I posted though, there is now a standard to generate the "random" number. It is based on a hash of the message plus the private key. So in any properly implemented wallet sw, that should never be an issue.

Eth has a lot of momentum behind it at the moment. Transaction volume is high and accelerating, and is currently about half that of bitcoin, and could easily pass bitcoin this year. Miner revenue for eth recently passed that of bitcoin, which means you can argue that bitcoin is now the second most secure blockchain. 
From a technical perspective, ethereum has PoS, sharding,  native zksnark intergration, and an LN-type network in the works. It is vastly more aggressive from a technical evolving standpoint. It might blow up, or it might turn out really well.
It is pretty easy for me to envision a scenario in which the market pass of eth surpasses that of bitcoin. On the other hand, I can also see it crashing.

I don't really see the harm in the way they are doing it. Even if it takes 30 minutes or more for the &gt;1MB of transactions to build up, is that really so long? 
We sometimes go 30 minutes between blocks now just based on normal mining variance.

You can close a short by matching a long BTC to it, which doesn't effect the market at all. So a trader might take out a large short position on bfx, backed by a large long position somewhere else (where they get full BCH credit).Post-fork, they transfer the BTC to bfx and close their short.

About 10-12x. I bought a bunch of Litecoin in January of this year at around $4 in anticipation of segwit. Unfortunately, for me, it took a lot longer than I thought it would for the litecoin miners to get on board and actually signal for segwit. I gave up and sold about a week before coblee made a negotiation trip to China and convinced them to signal, which started the runup.

You should request the withdraw. There isnt really any added risk. If coinbase sends you your coins and that transaction makes it into a block before the split, then you will have the private keys of both BTC and BCC. If that doesn't happen, coinbase has your keys at the time of the split, just as they do now. 
There is still 2.5 days left, so I think it is highly likely they will catch up before the split.

I don't think that is correct. The linked article says "The first block after the hard fork occurs is required (by design) to be larger than 1MB." So I think the other 9% can keep doing their thing and make their own chain, but it will not effect the mempool kept by the 91%.

In terms of the metrics to use to determine valuation, bitcoin is a lot more like gold than a company. The value of companies are based on how much money they can earn or have the potential to earn. A bitcoin, like gold, doesn't earn anything.

The 7000 BTC transaction included about 18 separate very large outputs, like 300+ btc each. It \*looks\* like the attacker gained control of the accounts of 18 Binance whales and initiated simultaneous withdraws for those 18 accounts. I find that kind of implausible though. People that have 300+ btc in their account tend to pay attention to security. A hacker gaining control of 18 such accounts through standard phishing type attacks seems unlikely to me.

Yeah, that is a decent point. It is a bit of an edge case, but given that it costs very little to write a hash to the blockchain, maybe that might make it worth it.
Another possible edge case scenario is that maybe there is some kind of diploma backdating scandal at the University, so that a party might reasonably want independent proof of authenticity and a timestamp.

For # 3, one important reason that will not happen is that a rationale actor, having spent all the money to get 51% hashpower, is not likely to do anything to destroy the value of their investment. 
 But for this hypothetical, assume that the actor is not rationale and doesn't mind losing a lot of money.  Their only goal is to destroy bitcoin.   They could do a lot of damage.  They could effectively stop all further development by not upgrading their sw; they could arbitrarily flip their hashing power on and off, causing extremely erratic block generation intervals; they could cut the capacity of hte network in half but only mining empty blocks; etc.

Bitcoin fees are not charged based on the amount of the transaction, but based on how much space the transaction takes up in the ledger. The balance in your wallet is probably spread out over a number of inputs, so the transaction takes up a lot of space. 
You may be able to reduce the fees though. In the "preferences" section you can go to "fees" and select "edit fees manually." It looks like you can currently go as low as 60-90 satoshis per byte and still have a decent chance of eventually getting your transaction mined (see  Definitely check the replace-by-fee option if you are going to try and go low on the fees.

In the blockchain.info wallet model, blockchain.info is never supposed to have access to an unencrypted version of your keys.  They only store an encrypted version of your keys, and all encryption is done locally at your computer.  So it is a bit of a misstatement to say they control your keys.

It also has an active community and a well funded and impressive dev team. You list premined as a negative, but because a lot of the premining profits are being used to fund the development, I view this as a huge positive.

The most plausible scenarios, in my opinion, are:
(1)  Bitcoin never solves the problem that network security is proportional to miner fees.  As the coinbase reward goes down, transaction fees don't rise enough to compensate.  People realize that an X billion dollar currency that can be attacked with only a Y million dollar investment in mining hardware is not very secure, and interest in bitcoin wanes.  As a variation of this hypothetical, an altcoin implements Proof of Stake, gets a lot of traction, PoS turns out to really good and provides excellent security, and bitcoin does not adapt.  Interest in bitcoin dwindles in favor of the altcoin.
(2) Some sort of event relating to miner centralization/collusion is exposed, and confidence in bitcoin tumbles. 
(3) 51% attack by some really well financed government or other entity.
(4) Interest in bitcoin just declines.  For whatever reason (maybe something better comes along, maybe not), people just lose interest in bitcoin and it goes on a long, slow decline to irrelevance.

Blockchain doesn't  add much value in this example. They University can just send you a digitally signed diploma document when you graduate. You can send the file to anyone and they can verify that the signature matches the one registered to the university.
The only thing the blockchain anchor proves is that the electronic diploma document existed at a particular date. But since readers are already trusting the University signature for authenticity, you may as well trust them to put the correct date on the document.

No. A bitcoin address is actually a hash of the public key. So to get the private key, an attacker would need to both reverse the hash and then find the private key for the public key. Quantum computers supposedly make finding the private key from the public key viable, but can't reverse the hash. 
To spend coins associated with an address, you need to send the public key to the network, so you no longer have the protection of the hash. For this reason, it is recommended to not reuse addresses    (i.e., your UTXO set should ideally each be associated with a different address).
@_date: 2016-07-21 18:02:42
That argument has some merit.  Calling the DAO attacker a thief also has some merit.  The community was split on this point, although my impression was that more people than not considered the hacker a thief.  
Virtually nobody however would consider the people that bought the Ulbricht coins, at a government auction, thieves.  
As an aside, the DAO attacker never actually had full control of the coins.  With no fork, the eth would likely have been locked in a hacker battle for some time.

Yeah, pretty much. If you receive three separate bitcoin transactions, and then want to spend the total, your transaction needs to reference each of those three transactions, which takes up space. With fees as high as they are, it is possible to get an input that is so small that it would cost more in fees to spend than the input is worth.
Another option is to wait and hope that bitcoin eventually gets a scaling solution that will reduce the cost/byte to get a transaction mined.

Once those miners actually start running segwit2x, and get 80%+ signaling, they will start rejecting any blocks that are not signaling segwit. Since they have 80% of the hashrate, their chain will be the longest chain, and we will be at 100%.

If both bitcoins and fiat could be instantly and frictionlessly transmitted between exchanges, the prices across exchanges would be all more or less identical. However, that is not the case.

Countries with capital controls, like India and China, place strict limits on how much local currency you can convert into dollars. So exchanges in these countries tend to have the biggest price differences.

I hadn't heard about bitcoin back then, but I've read old bitcointalk posts discussing it. Before the first exchanges, I'm pretty sure buying bitcoins meant posting to a bitcointalk forum saying you wanted to buy some and then directly dealing with anyone interested in selling.
I remember one post in particular in which someone was trying to sell bitcoins. Something like 10k coins for $50 (i'm probably off on those numbers). He didn't get any buyers.

"Safe" is a vague word to use here.
Bitcoin transactions are irreversible. If someone gets your private key they can take your bitcoins and there is nothing you can do about it. The risk of having your private key stolen due to malware, or by some other means is real.
On the other hand, the risk that the government or some other entity can confiscate you bitcoins is a lot less than with a bank.

I am not mistaken in this. Your bitcoin address is always known by the blockchain, not the ECDSA public key. This is true for all P2PKH (pay-to-public-key-hash) and P2SH addresses. It is not true for P2PK (pay-to-public-key) addresses, but those have not been used since the early days of bitcoin.

You can just make up anything you want. The only constraint is that the last few characters are checksum data, so you can't really pick those.

The wait time for confirmation should not be a problem for Uber/Lyft. Payments aren't currently in done in real-time with the driver anyway.

But that publication did not even mention like-kind-exchange.  It did explicitly say that virtual currency is treated as property. I don't  see why the like-kind-exchange rules would not apply.

I own both for that reason. Also, I think they are good complimentary bets: Bitcoin is more conservative and focused on being the standard for decentralized store of value; Ethereum is much more aggressive in evolving and adding features. 
I can't know for certain which approach will win. I think they can both find their own niches. If one should dominate the other though, I will still be ok. 
Now if Doge takes over the world, however, well then I am screwed.
