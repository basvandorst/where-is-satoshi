I doubt it, they would be hesitant in case other banks dump before they do, I imagine the first few days would be banks just hedging their positions.
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:25:39
How have you come to that conclusion lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:49:59
Unless you're hedging your position...
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:39:07
This is as dumb as your post history.
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:23:27
Very possible
@_date: 2017-12-09 09:52:12
That all has no intrinsic value, you can't value bitcoin as an equity. The value is what anyone pays for it, the big money could reduce this.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:48:41
Seems too good to be true.
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:33:17
Okay, I know there's a lot of tension between both but why is it? The value is high so people are buying it, is it centralised or has more coins in issue than people think?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:36:00
Goldman can be buying tons of BTC now, then put a short in and dump their holding. Makes it more attractive for institutions.

So it's sounds as though you've persuaded him to invest as opposed to him choosing it.

Blockfolio my friend

Warren is a low risk investor, of course he's not condoning bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:21:52
Where can I watch this? This should be a screensaver.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:36:02
If they buy back in lower then certainly.

I sent a SEPA from HSBC and it's been 3 days now!

If someone is 80% in profit and sells on the drop still realising 70% profit, they're smart. Not you.

Stockbroker here! Futures of BTC will have zero effect on the banks, the only correlation at the moment are blockchain based companies even if they have nothing to do with BTC.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:41:42
Lol you must be new to investing my friend.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:30:19
Because he topped up you muppet

They're not regulated by the FCA...

Stop looking at the price, flick the TV on.

You have the oldest Reddit account I've seen. Well done!
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:57:39
Who the hell plays music behind commentary...
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:41:08
Do you also pay a miners fee on this? 
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:17:48
If someone has 10% of their portfolio in bitcoin and it increases to 15% they will probably remove 5% to stay diversified. Pretty smart really. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 13:53:06
Phew! ����‍♂️
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:27:57
You only profit when you sell.
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:42:15
Also the 20% margin is steep!
@_date: 2017-11-01 18:46:39
Not only does the link not work, you've posted this like 5 times today. It's not that no one is seeing it, it's that no one cares.

It will never destroy banking if it is anonymous.
Business borrow money daily, banks borrow money daily, bonds are created against money. You cant lend an anonymous currency and expect to be paid back. Unless there is a middleman created that can pull from wallets but even then the coins have moved by the time it goes through. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:17:33
You start a Reddit account 10 minutes ago to promote your company. Just say, "hey I started a company take a look".
@_date: 2017-10-23 10:21:40
You could invest say $500 dollars that could be worth $750 in three months. 
You can then turn it into cash or as some people do, spend the bitcoins and replace what you spend with cash. 
The long term goal is for bitcoin to be a easily accessible currency like £$€ etc.

Change your homepage to google, helps a lot.

Just realised how dumb that was. Nothing is down 700% other than Harvey's career.
@_date: 2017-10-17 09:00:55
Can you confidently hedge against bitcoin, fairly new to crypto but not investing. Is there anything out there with a negative coefficient? 
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:16:22
Fees are typically capped at $300-$600 so unlikely you'll pay anywhere near that.

Good luck with your exam!
@_date: 2017-10-24 16:06:42
That's a common issue with low investment, you wouldn't batter an eye lid if you invested $10k. The fees are a good chunk of your investment right now. 
You've done the hard part, you've started. Buy low when it dips but don't kick yourself now. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 19:54:21
2nd this.
@_date: 2017-10-23 11:28:57
Do your research on the storage, uses and risks of bitcoin prior to investing. Bitcoin will always be there when you are ready. 
You can buy BTC on localbitcoins.com with gbp. They hold the funds in escrow so little chance of getting scammed. I've used them before. Pick a seller with high feedback.
@_date: 2017-10-29 23:02:19
Shit, you're right! That sucks ha
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:44:04
Fuck me $6220! Was this today? Is the spread on these huge?
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:36:33
Do you have other investments in your portfolio too? Outside of cryptos.

How's your clothing brand going?

This is a terrible idea. Don't get a loan to gamble with. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:46:49
It would have been leveraged so he realistically probs lost 10-20%. Either way a bad day.
