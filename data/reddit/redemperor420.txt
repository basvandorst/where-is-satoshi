You can already with bitcoin cash
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:49:17
You are right. it is kinda sad to see that both bitcoin communities don’t try a multidimensional scaling approach. The one only cares about 2 layer solution, the other only raises the blocksize limit. 
I looks like the future belongs to other cryptocurrencies that address the issue in a more diverse way.

Try bitcoin cash. Fees are a few cents
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:15:48
So much salt
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:40:44
But how can you call for a file against insider trading and be against regulation?

posts like this encourage me that my selling decision was good

Thats going to be a expensive haircut
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:09:50
Its so funny how this sub i making up excuses for everything right now. You really dont see the writing on the wall. Its roger ver, coinbase and everybody elses fault that the fees are so high richt now? . Keep believing that

Increase of blocksize was planned and encouraged by the developers. But the cummunity didnt want it so the update for 2mb blocksize was blown off
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:35:18
Do you really want the government to regulate crypto?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:31:53
i know you are very smart but this doesnt change the validity of my argument. 
coinbase had a huge part in making bitcoin to what it is today and roger ver was once regarded as bitcoin „jesus“ Just because they dont act in you interest know there is no reason to get so salty. like i said. It is an unregulated market you cant do anything.

Is it hard to ignore the elephant in the room?

There cant be help from the government without us losing our sovereignty

this is a problem i agree on. But on the other hand. with a mempool sometimes over 200 000 tx, small nodes cant mine either, because their ram is just too small to save the whole mempool .
Of course, out of a „HODLER“ perspective this fee-problem isnt too bad, because these people dont actually use bitcoin. They just use it as an investment vehicle, so fees dont matter. What the hodlers dont see is that actual users like me shift to other currencies like bch, because fees over 10 dollars and long confirmation times make this whole thing just unusable. 
i just have the feeling that this whole anti 2X movement is more emotion driven than by actual facts. out of my perspective a temporary shift to 2 mb would have been the right thing. Even if LN comes in under a year, by then most of the actual users will have shifted to other, actually usable cryptos.

The problem is, that the blocksize increase got blown of by people having zero idea about the technical aspects and now everybody is too invested in the small block agenda and therefore cant admit that the blocksize has to go up. Virtually anybody in the blockchain world exept for bitcoin core people agree that theblocksize has to go up.

There are many open source projects with a roadmap
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:17:47
yes of course but i just wonder why people wonder how this can happen. crypto is like the wild west of anarcho capitalism. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:26:23
is a part of the bitcoin community with a different approach to the scaling problem than bitcoin. Bitcoin cash is a version of bitcoin more suited to many transactions through dynamic increase of blocksize. Allthough this modification could lead to centralisation. Pretty complex debate. 
Support of larger blocksize and bitcoin cash offend some people on this sub, so i wouldnt give much on the answers you got on this question. Do your research ans decide yourself. Looking on the current mempool i am starting to believe that it is good to keep some bch as a hedge
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:54:00
You may be right. We just have to be careful what we wish for. i would rather vote with my money and move it to another exchange than get our beloved government into this issue. 
But maybe thats a philosophical issue and we wont get to an conclusion here. I still hope you have a good day and we all will be blessed by better, reliable and fair exchanges

I know my comment will get downvoted/deleted for this but:
Maybe look in r/btc for information about bitcoin cash. It is bitcoin but with lower tx-fees. Has its problems too but look it up yourself
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:21:47
Nothing stands against bigger blocks exept people who are too invested in their opinion about block size increase
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:43:15
I agree with you that it was unfair and of course it is bad for the people that lost their money. I just believe the crypto community has to solve these problems themselves
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:32:29
Come with me. Nobody will judge you. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:07:24
You bought BITCOIN. the whole POINT IS THAT IT IS NOT REGULATED. jeez. just because things didnt went the way you wanted them to go, dont get salty. 
You wanted a unregulated currency. You got it. Get f*cking over it
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:20:03
Fully agree. At the end thats how giants fall. i believe bitcoin will be remembered as the AOL of blockchain if no miracle happens. first movers advantage cant last forever.
Whatever. The market will decide.
