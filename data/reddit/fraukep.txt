Markets can drop so fast that your stop order only get filled much later.

If anything the high fees and long confirmation times will become a bigger problem that will start to become to focus of discussion. Especially if we fail to see significant price increases.
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:42:21
It can also be way less
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:44:58
What happens in that case?

I know the veterans say back in the day it was unclear whether bitcoin is to stay or not but I feel it also had much more upside. Even if it were to reach a trillion market cap which is still a big if that is "only" a 300% return. Nice, but not really life changing money

Doubt you live in a third world country when you were able to save so much.

The market can stay irrational longer than you can stay solvent.

So you just reposted this from a post that was only on here less than 24 hours ago?

you can't even accurately apply technical analysis used for financial markets to financial markets

What could go wrong?

You`ve been hitting the crack pipe again?

Problem is by the time you transfered the money Bitcoin could be down 10% against the local currency.

I would like to know how many people invested because they saw the price increases and how many people invested because they saw the bigger picture.

Did not mean to come at you so hard. Sometimes it is easy to project the actions of politicians on the average Joo even though that is unfair.

Hope you have other assets (stocks, bonds) because a well diversified portfolio is the closest thing to a free lunch when it comes to investing
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:54:36
Yeah, great job you guys did in the middle East. Iraq really had a great time after Hussein was gone. Lybia is also thriving after you guys ousted Gaddafi
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:02:34
Not really. Still needs to pay income tax.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:40:56
Still wrong though.

Makes no sense to spend Bitcoin for your normal expenses like grocery shopping with the fees being as they are and how long it takes to confirm transactions.

Central banks must clamp down on bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies to stop them “piggybacking” on mainstream institutions and becoming a “threat to financial stability”, the head of the Bank for International Settlements has warned.
Agustín Carstens, general manager of the BIS - known as the bank for central banks because it is where they hold accounts - condemned bitcoin as “a combination of a bubble, a Ponzi scheme and an environmental disaster”.
His comments came as growing signs of a backlash against cryptocurrencies by mainstream financial institutions contributed to another steep fall in the price of bitcoin, which means it has lost almost two-thirds of its market value in the past month.
Bitcoin extended its recent losses on Tuesday morning to briefly fall below $6,000 per coin, down more than $13,000 from its peak in December.
“To date, many judge that, given cryptocurrencies’ small size and limited interconnectedness, concerns about them do not rise to a systemic level,” said Mr Carstens in a speech at Goethe University in Germany on Tuesday morning.
“But if authorities do not act pre-emptively, cryptocurrencies could become more interconnected with the main financial system and become a threat to financial stability.”
Mr Carstens, the former head of Mexico’s central bank, conceded that many of the world’s main central banks have closely examined the potential to transform their own operations using blockchain, or distributed ledger technology (DLT), which underpins cryptocurrencies.
But he said: “In practice, central bank experiments show that DLT-based systems are very expensive to run and slower and much less efficient to operate than conventional payment and settlement systems.”
Pointing out that the “mining” process to create new bitcoins uses the same amount of electricity as Singapore each day, Mr Carstens said “the current fascination with these cryptocurrencies seems to have more to do with speculative mania than any use as a form of electronic payment, except for illegal activities”.
“Accordingly, authorities are edging closer and closer to clamping down to contain the risks related to cryptocurrencies,” he said, pointing out that it was “alarming that some banks have advertised ‘bitcoin ATMs’ where you can buy or sell bitcoins”.
“If the only ‘business case’ is use for illicit or illegal transactions, central banks cannot allow such tokens to rely on much of the same institutional infrastructure that serves the overall financial system and freeload on the trust that it provides,” he added.
His comments come the day after European Central Bank chief Mario Draghi also warned about bitcoin, describing the cryptocurrency as a “very risky” and “entirely speculative” asset.
