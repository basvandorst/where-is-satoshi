Yes, its a hazzle to get hold of Bitcoin. Unless there is a better price when paying in Bitcoins I wont spend them. Though thats fine with me as I also can see them working as a digital store of value similar to gold. However this can be solved by stores in a couple of ways. 
1. Offer a better price say 10% cheaper. 
2. Offer a price guarantee, if bought with bitcoin and bitcoins rise in value in the coming month we will give you back some of your bitcoins so you have a price guaranteed for a month.
3. Both, a discount and a price guarantee.
Now I would start spending.
But as of now I cant buy things I know will lose value with Bitcoins I know might double in value this year.
Thats a bad deal.
However once price of bitcoins are stable for a month or two I will start spending coins again.
