Am I missing something here?  Why would a genuine hacker use the same wallet or address for multiple hacks over many years?  I'm not buying this at all.
Either this guy is really stupid (yet smart enough to do these hacks) or it's fake and they all tie together to confuse the gullible and easily confused.

Yes that's the quote.  They claim to have the "resources" to back the Tethers...not the USD in the bank.  If they had that, they would say it clearly.  And there would be a proper audit that would show that.  It would take one day to do such an audit.  You just verify the bank statements and look at the tethers on the blockchain.  That's it.
Try harder, because you are failing pretty badly at this point.

I am not going to spend all day, arguing with Bitfinex employees.  The statement is right there, for all to read.  I linked it.

"shows clearly that Tether has the resources to back Tethers that have been issued."
They apparently don't have the USD to back the $600 million in issued Tethers...they have the "resources". 
" When Tethers are issued, assets are debited (added) to the assets on Tether’s balance sheet, and Tethers are credited (added) to the business’s liabilities."
They say it more clearly there.  They created $600 million in Tethers and they are not claiming to have that amount of USD in the bank.  They just owe $600 million now on the balance sheet from the liability.
And they even blame their lack of transparency on "terrorists".   Read the entire statement...pretty amazing that they get away with all of this.
Proceed with caution.

That is the goofiest thing I've heard in the last hour, and that says a lot.  You are very confused.

They got "hacked" just like Bitfinex got "hacked"...probably pure fuckery.

The link says it all.   It's all there in their own words.

He makes some good points in there, but he's a lot more patient than me and a lot of other people. He's content to pay $10 fees for years until some better solution is magically found.
And I am a bit fan of Andreas and I listened to this entire speech, but just saying he is sometimes too idealistic.  That's one of the things I like about him, but  it's still the case.
