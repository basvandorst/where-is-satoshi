1.  A twitter account pascalreid, hasn't tweeted in a year, all the sudden tweets about this
2. A reddit account, pascalreid is created specifically to talk about this.
3. A reddit account bungeetaco is inactive for 8 months, then posts about this.
4. A nonprofessional looking site (
When you're on the internet as long as I am, you look for PROOF. I can create the website ' and create a reddit account called reidpascal and ask for donations. That doesn't mean shit. You have offered no proof that you are the man you say you are. Doing a Google search for 'supportpascal' brings nothing noteworthy. As does Google for your mother 'Chantal Desbois'
The proof I'd take? Log into your local bitcoin account and sign a message. But I'm sure you can't do that. So unfortunately, it's a moot point.

And please don't think I'm attacking you or trying to undermine your cause, you should just understand, especially if you understand the bitcoin protocol and the blockchain, the idea of proof and trust.

If they're on the internet, they're very much public. 
Who's to say this isn't a puppet account set up 2 weeks ago for this purpose? Where's the proof it's you?
