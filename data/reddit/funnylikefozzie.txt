One of the main selling points behind bitcoin is there is no central bank to manipulate and inflate away the value of your currency which encourages positive behaviors like saving.

The way capital gains is assessed is on the Basis and sales prices.  If you never sell your BTC, but instead trade it for another capital investment (e.g. a Tesla roadster) there is no sale of the original investment.  You end up converting one capital investment into another.

I am not saying they wouldn't care, but current rules are absurd and exceedingly difficult to enforce.  Value of btc is exceeding volatile right now.  It seems like there would be an easy way to get around most current tax law, as it is not geared for tracking btc tx the same way it is for stocks and bonds.
I would imagine the purchase of a vehicle that bypasses using USD and traditional banks would be very difficult for the current IRS to track.
We should be treating it as a currency. I wonder what the basis is for treating it as an capital asset, do you know?

This is probably a flexible interpretation, but if the transaction completely bypasses the banking system who is going to report it?
This is all besides the fact that btc is supposed to be a currency, and not a capital investment either. There is no underlying asset of value other than that ascribed to it by its adopters.

And a good way to avoid capital gains tax

Believe me I understand. However I think IRS reporting rules for bitcoin are ridiculous, and will have to be modified. The IRS is asking individuals to monitor and every btc transaction in and out (amount and value) in order to report capital gains on what should be considered a currency. His includes every btc mined. 
It is just impossible to tax crypto the same way stocks and bonds are taxed. 
What do you think of the current rules?

I think he can safely count himself among the many of whom he says do not understand cryptocurrency.
