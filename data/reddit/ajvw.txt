This is exactly the case where no one will worry if due diligence of rules was used by the FBI but then may be there were people linked to this judge and hence turn this criminal offence away.
Whereas in the SilkRoad case there is no clear evidence against Ross but then since he is a scape goat whetever method FBI used was ok!

You seem to have included a fee (medium priority), but I guess the recent blocks are being full and the network may be choking. It might not be your fault. Just wait around. There is a war on blocksize consensus going on and innocent people may be caught in the cross-fire.
@_date: 2015-06-25 01:33:05
The miners have agreed to Gavin's proposal as well. They just have expressed the rest of the blockstream-backed developers to drop a little of their vested interest and their huge ego :-)
@_date: 2015-06-10 16:26:15
The 1MB core developers are just insecure that their solution will not sell if a 21MB blocksize is in place. They belong to the business of blockstream, whereas Gavin is almost independent financially and is more dependable, in my opinion.
@_date: 2015-06-02 23:46:59

You can receive in USD. That is not the question here. He wants to pay in BTC and bitpay kind of solutions will automatically convert it to USD when you receive it. Nothing to lose. "You" will receive USD. It will just help "him" pay in BTC. That is the plan here.

What he probably means is that "only if" it will be a medium of exchange would it be a good investment. Otherwise it is definitely going to be a bad investment. The first requirement for bitcoin to survive is it should be a frictionless medium of exchange. Only then will it carry value. Otherwise it would die. That is what it was invented for --- a p2p frictionless medium of exchange --- and that is "money" --- investment!

may be the miners can distribute the transaction fees (which is small currently) to all the full nodes while they get to keep their block bounty of 25BTC. When the bounty reduces to half ie 12.5 BTC the distribution to the nodes could also be halved. So on and so forth :-)

No. You assume that people who hoard bitcoin will spend it without replenishing it. But, those invested in bitcoin and who understand it won't just spend alone. Instead they will buy bitcoin and use it with these corporations. That will be a price equilibrium. Bitcoiners will buy-and-spend or spend-and-buy immediately in succession. That does not change the price equilibrium.
If the price falls it is because of selling "pressure" exceeding buying "pressure" and the converse also.

Sorry. I did not get your point. Chargebacks are done by the creditcard user. In this case I (we) the end user. For the end user:
Get BTC: for credit card payments. purse.io suffers if there is a chargeback. That is their problem. We are protected!
Get Amazon products: I (we) place a credit card purchase order on Amazon through purse.io. ~~I can't chargeback as purse.io has collected BTC from our payment.~~ purse.io suffers if I chargeback. I guess they route it to amazon and probably they are protected a bit there too.

While it is so irritating to hear without being able to interject his own shooting in the foot this guy looks like a clown who seems to even understand the blockchain technology but pretends to "act" dumb about bitcoin and its network.

Who asked you to store your bitcoins there? Did he do that? You are responsible for your actions. not him. BTW, I do have some bitcoins there. I still believe mtgox is a safe place. I just respect them for being the pioneers. you are just worried about your money there. they have their life in there. and I am very clear to have only the amount I do not worry let go in btc. and surely that is not a small amount bro for me! why don't you start a great exchange then! relax...
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:25:21
Yes. just "dollar cost average" after convincing yourselves it is a great technology and put in only what you don't mind losing.
@_date: 2014-03-06 09:07:39
That forces the early adopters to spend BTC which will come into circulation. If they don't, BTC will not take off. That is good for us small holders in the long run until we are able to have income and expenditure in BTC. Awaiting that day when I can earn BTC and spend BTC easily. Hope the early adopters carefully go about this.

BTW, btcxindia is the best working live trading platform in India till date that we have got and it is very difficult for anyone to deny it :-)
In fact, I appreciate btcxindia keeping so low about their business without any hype. Hope the indian bitcoin community notices it and helps them to improve.

Sounds too good to be true! why would mastercard allow this. Will it not hurt them in the long run?
Edit: If this debit stuff is done by selling your bitcoins on bitstamp, why can't we use this card in credit mode by buying from bitstamp and instantly spend it on bitcoin accepting sites. In fact I would prefer that. My suggestion is to be cautious with your BTC on this card :-) put in only the amount of BTC you don't mind loosing :-)

It is actually very easy to buy low and sell high. If you bought it at X do not sell unless the price is &gt;X. If you sell at Y do not buy until the price is &lt;Y. Of course you can do that very easily. I do not think it is rocket science. Is it not that easy. But remember to put in only the amount that you are willing to lose :-) If you miss that, this strategy will become very very difficult.

Now I see that you are confused :-D
I use creditcards as usual at amazon (but help the bitcoin network)
Get bitcoin for creditcards.
Why are you bothered about purse.io They will think for themselves.
The idea here is that now we have somebody who is willing to 1. give you btc for creditcards or 2. help bitcoin network using creditcards by you taking a minor difficulty of going through their site.
The enduser is well protected in my opinion.


don't be bothered to use creditcards and ignore purse.io

Unless you need to convert to fiat money immediately you do NOT need anybody. Just a bitcoin address and a QR code picture from your bitcoin client. But be careful about verifying the transaction using say atleast blockchain.info for 3--6 confirmations. Be careful not to expose your bitcoin client to some naughty customers :-) All the very best.

This is why everyone should have a backup of an "ENCRYPTED" wallet in multiple geographical locations. Hope you have!

Withdraw bitcoins and sell it on localbitcoins.com. Might work better than withdrawing fiat currency. Though I am not sure about that too.

are you sure? bitstamp seems to have intertwining addresses! coinbase is ok but not accessible from outside usa and is not a trading site. campBX --- you should be joking :-) I have no clue about kraken even though there is some noise about it. btc-e ofcourse is untraceable.
While people seem to be talking about distributed exchange, I doubt if such a system can deal with fiat currencies.
In my opinion nothing better than mtgox existed till last week. now even that is gone. BTW, I do have an account on bitstamp, purely for arbitrarge. but seriously i will not leave my btc on any exchange for long anyway from now on unless i have better trust in any of them. mtgox is still high on my list :-) sorry if that hurts.
@_date: 2014-04-03 10:29:36
Yeah. That is what I meant. People will invest their time and freedom to make something useful. They don't expect others' investments. They do it themselves. Those who have just bought bitcoins --- have they not paid for Satoshi's time? Yes they have. Nothing wrong with hoarding. When the time is right they will exchange (invest) for other things. That is the free market.
@_date: 2014-12-18 04:46:26
You assume that bitcoin hodl'ers only spend and do not replenish.
Price is going down because there are still loose hands or selling pressure. That is all to it.
The bitcoin technology as of now is pretty robust. Ofcourse it is an experiment and lots of improvements are on the way. There is still no buying pressure. When that happens, price will shoot up. Be patient. Invest only what you can afford to loose.

The criteria in these exchanges is only to prove your identity. So I am in India with identity proof for the exchanges. I agree there are great risks. But we are starting small and experimenting. People (local to the exchange) who want to send fiat needs to send it to these exchanges to our accounts (as you say that is not difficult)! All we need is to transfer the btc across. This is what bitcoin is for --- transact across nations --- right now it is either direct btc or through exchanges to receive in BTC!

Thanks for the offer and encouragement.
I will be setting up wallets through coinbase, kraken, bitstamp, btc-e, mtgox just in case people in these areas interested can send fiat money to be converted to btc for ourselves. I think that is the way to go. To convert fiat into BTC and if required for taxation purposes conversion to local fiat.
In India while agriculture is "encouraged" of course there are cartels that manipulate the markets. We are trying to experiment here if bitcoin could improve the condition for this community. Hope it will be good. Thanks.

While I do agree with your sentiment, it should be noted that they did play their cards very close to their chest without the whole community knowing their troubles clearly (which is ok). In fact I see all the big guys shouting against mtgox seem to have some inside agenda to do this --- either to push new comers to their exchange or the usual hype for market manipulation for bitcoins :-) either way bitcoin benefits. they will support mtgox once they pull it off (if it happens).

A novice to the stock market --- or for that matter any economics --- around 2009 after the economic crash I invested into a life insurance (AIG in a new form in this country) ~350 USD/year for 3 mandatory-years (=~1500 USD). In this period there was a fee of ~350 USD. Even though there was a marginal profit in the stock price that is a loss of 33%!
Had learnt about BTC after the April 2013 crash -- thrilled by its technical greatness --- invested ~1500 USD over a period of 8 months. Now that investment is on a ~400% profit :-)
Hence, just recently surrendered (ditched) the AIG insurance at a 33% loss and invested into bitcoin at ~450 USD/BTC (after the recent crash). The official reason stated for the surrender of AIG insurance was "The markets are rigged and have lost faith in the current economic system"
Surely the investments are amounts that I do not mind loosing. But I know bitcoins are the foundations of the networked future.
I don't plan to sell. Only spend! Unfortunately not yet easy to buy-spend in India!

It is true that they are trying to sell gold and silver for fiat. We do see that. But isn't it not true that to survive in the "short term" we need fiat. We can take the extreme view to get fully out of fiat instantly. But that is foolish for our survival. We have to beat the system from within. For me gold and silver "seem" to be good store of value but not good currency --- but bitcoin is. Fiat seems to be bad in both of these. Other properties seem ok between gold and bitcoin though. Thanks for the critical view, but that has sharpened my inclination towards bitcoin and gold. Fiat currency still has the "trust" problem. Don't you think so?
And don't you think "bitcoin needs more snake oil salesmen" is kind of an extreme view? particularly when you do note that "because the community isn't slimy enough yet" :-)

It is accepted by Bobby Lee himself that chinese exchanges are rigged. Not that I underestimate other exchanges. How are you sure that these exchange guys are not in bed with the pboc and manipulating the whole chinese market as and in turn the entire bitcoin market. In this btc space it is difficult to trust anybody :-) I would rather trust Karpeles for his service to bitcoin. The later greedy fellows are just angry at him just because they lost a lot of money. Even I lost some money on mtgox, but strangely I still side with Kaepeles and would like to help him if possible :-D than all those blood thirsty money greedy fellows! Ok I have rant-ed enough.

1. Bitcoin will not tide you over your expired ATM card. You have not stated for what reason you want to replace the ATM card with bitcoin!
2. Most people will not sell BTC through paypal.
3. Your remote location is not a big problem for BTC in india if you have online banking and NEFT, RTGS or IMPS (Instant mobile payment system).
4. Get a bitcoin wallet.
5. Register yourselves on localbitcoins. There are sellers there. Since the BTC price is going down, may be it is a great time to purchase :-)
6. You can buy from localbitcoins. Please be careful: place the order, check for "ESCROW", make payment, mark payment complete "IMMEDIATELY" after payment completion, wait for release of escrow, withdraw to your personal bitcoin wallet.
7. It is pretty easy. Just be careful :-) All the very best.
8. I have bought on localbitcoins in India several times without a hitch. The sellers are great. Generally there is a 5--30% (atleast) extra charge over market rate though.

I thought John accepted that they were behind the "crisis strategy draft". Did he not?
Nobody needs to be made aware of such possibilities. For the kind of business that mtgox offered I am sure there are vultures waiting to devour the most lucrative piece of meat availble, I should say :-)
Running a bitcoin exchange seems to be least of the problem for now. It is getting the right business plan which is more important. There are a lot of bitcoin exchanges being run by so many people. It seems to be not a very difficult thing. But running it properly as a financial business seems to be the most troublesome part. This is what is important now in my opinion.

As of now for me it is between loosing all the coins on "eMpTy Gox" or "trusting" another probable "venture capitalist" who can take it up professionally than just shouting down us :-)
Of course they do have their eye on getting on the largest trading community of bitcoins for "profit". Is that not all of us are greedy for? I had only put what I was willing to loose. In that sense I do not care if gox goes belly up totally. But I would prefer to savegox and get Karpeles (who surely is a poor communicator) to reveal the real problems.
All those guys just shouting at Karpeles could have done a better job on their own exchange is my logic to dismiss all those greedy ones!

Currency campus line of digital red song celebrates victory 70 years
Currency campus line of digital red song celebrates 70 years of war the Red Army's heritage light, played youth movement! August 15, 2015 is the 70th anniversary of the anniversary of the war, as a contemporary college students, we should bear in mind the revolution is not easy, cherish life. At the same time inspire students to love the motherland and socialism, optimistic, cheerful, positive spirit in practice the socialist core values, to achieve the great rejuvenation of the ambitious, to show students a positive and healthy aesthetic pursuit.
At this time, Sichuan universities, Chengdu University of Information Engineering University of Information Security, held on May 21 at the school campus Red Song, sing patriotic songs, the red cultural heritage, promote the theme of the times, create a healthy campus culture, reflect the truth, goodness, the United States, campus cultural characteristics. To commemorate the 70th anniversary of the victory of the war as an opportunity to set off patriotic songs sung on campus, love the motherland, the Red to the party of the boom, train young students patriotism, practice the socialist core values. Efforts to achieve ideological and artistic unity, reflecting the characteristics of the times, school characteristics and student characteristics.
At the same time, the domestic currency-bit digital element catches our eye, they entered the campus, sponsored this historic event, the victory of the war 70 years, technology has developed for 70 years, the Internet is also rapid, with the "Internet +" concept was put forward, the strong support of the Prime Minister Li Keqiang, derived from the Internet such as Internet + finance, agriculture Internet + Internet + car, and a series of concept was pushed air. As a digital currency, it is also a major attraction in the Internet-derived product. As the number of bits yuan currency, and I believe that they must work harder.
Activities, bits yuan full sponsorship of its activities to facilitate the event is completed, the students have to live in this new thing of digital money quite interested, by the way interviewed a number of students, found that people do not know much digital money, know it, they also did not know Bitcoin, pragmatic development of domestic digital currency unaware, they only know Bitcoin, but too expensive, not to buy, because the price will alienate this great invention. Interviews with students, their information security professional, they should be more likely to contribute their efforts to currency security, as we all know, in recent months, domestic digital currency theft very much, leading to much more businesses closed , for a number of trading platform. One digital currency senior amateur Lin of the students said: "Domestic digital currency on foot too much, there is little good, and there was little good things, and today saw bits yuan leaflets, turned a bit past history, we found to have stable operation of more than one year, up to more than 120,000 registered users, and in doing good, this also came to our school, as far as I know, in addition to Nicholls Bitcoin Chinese yuan in the spread of the major schools and Dr. Han Feng In a speech major universities, they are Bitcoin digital currency other, really only bits yuan, I will continue to favor the bits yuan, dormitory, will conduct research studies. "After a number of female college students also learned a bit yuan on the PC and mobile terminals were experience. Below are some photos:

Also the author of a digital currency enthusiasts, today went very novel bit yuan's official website looked, Baidu a little past history and found that they do have a place of innovation, their participation in the 2014 Shanghai Expo Bitcoin, a speech, a "What kind of Bitcoin applications will change the world" swept all platforms at the time, mainly because they have innovative technologies. According to China Economic Net reported earlier this year, they changed the bitcoin currency POS multi-signature and some of the core code that can create a theft, loss can retrieve functions, high security, running more than a year, it has been very stable. Retrieve function is indeed to the force, the author of Bitcoin really do not know where to store it, the presence of the official website, the platform collapse how to do? There is a local, not accidentally formatted or password forgotten how to do? Let me exceedingly tangled, but bits yuan just to solve this problem, there is a feeling of worry-free anywhere, is a digital currency must be guaranteed. Currently OF bitcoins will put up OKCOIN, fire and other large currency network platform hands, or trustworthy.
After the event, many students have also discussed on the way from the digital currency, the authors feel that today's Internet age more and more intense, more contemporary college students should not be left behind, the digital currency industry will arise like Ali Baba, companies like Google in the future We should doubly concerned, to create digital currency value, but also give yourself a chance!

While you can have $5000/BTC without wide adoption, the otherway is not "probable". Wide adoption will imply higher price as it is scarce. So I side with wide adoption and that implies $5000/BTC. :-)

this is their real problem, and I do not see that going away. right now they are hiding. will come back with full force even if you give them a little space (i have seen many such people as i have been through some of the top ranking universities which have a lot of such people). all that can be done now is to puncture their ego, which is the only thing that is in the way of bitcoin.
that can be done only with competing clients. xt/unlimited/classic/bitcore and many more may be required.

The question is for the upper limit. There is a minimum size for a transaction (sz_min byte say). Then upper limit is 10^6 / sz_min. I am not sure what is sz_min. Usually transactions are bigger than sz_min, that will reduce the number of transactions to fit into the 1MB block.
Assuming (correct me) sz_min is approx ~~100~~ 200 bytes, approx ~~10,000~~ 5,000 transactions may be the upper limit. But since most transaction are larger than ~~100~~ 200 bytes, it might be lot lesser than ~~10,000~~ 5,000.

this is their real problem, and I do not see that going away. right now they are hiding. will come back with full force even if you give them a little space (i have seen many such people as i have been through some of the top ranking universities which have a lot of such people). all that can be done now is to puncture their ego, which is the only thing that is in the way of bitcoin.
that can be done only with competing clients. xt/unlimited/classic/bitcore and many more may be required.
Edit: Look at Linus Torvalds. He is arrogant but still highly loved. Look at Richard Stallman. Very arrogant. But an adorable genius. We want such people and find Gavin, Jeff and Mike fit in those strong, articulate and adorable attitudes...

yeah! finally you are beginning to think for yourselves!
@_date: 2017-03-25 04:58:37
Refuting the refute: ;-)
Comparison should be segwit and unlimited supporting nodes. Everyone knows it is difficult to estimate how many genuine segwit or unlimited nodes are!
why should anybody other than core attack unlimited even if that is just one! and nobody admits they are malicious ;-) same do not discredit unlimited as well! logical fallacy ;-)
resources? anybody paying adequate fees is not spam! falsehood!
you write careful code to bump of decentralized coding teams! roger lost money! you should be happy for him to burn up! why worry about his burning! are you advising him? ;-)
everybody has to upgrade? learn baby! falsehood. infact none of the newbies who use non-node wallets need to upgrade! whereas with segwit all clueless newbies will have to upgrade or fear losing their coins ;-)
rbitcoin censor: logical fallacy: guilt by association: 2 different matters: brush it under the carpet ;-)
bugs: satoshi should not have released buggy 0.1 bitcoin node. everybody will attack and kill it! and satoshi was one only person. who is he to take over the chancellors of the worlds.
core intentionally advocates high fee and full blocks: nonsense: stupid and crazy: this is the scaling debate baby! people are putting their personal money to scaling debate and you talk and even i can talk ;-)
some crazy people might have said high fees and high confirmation time is good for bitcoin: core my dear core!
core intentionally breaking bitcoin: broken record: you are. how many bitcoins do you use on a daily basis?
adam got involved when $1000 and roger under $1: adam came around and killing it! :-)
attacking core after hardfork: it won't be necessary to attack core dear and even if there is an attack as you earlier claimed just some one and only one person can attack ;-)
subscribe to future gravy: you will be bust soon. or who knows you may come around like adam and hope not kill bitcoin!
NO SOUP FOR YOU :-D I mean subscription!
@_date: 2016-03-21 05:17:45
The short answer:
1. blocks are never scarce.
2. blocks will be always found in about 10 minutes.
3. transaction can be confirmed even if no new coins are found.

If those 4000 commits are what BU want to escape is precisely why they forked off! simple! your background seems to be in centralized systems. this is decentralization! that is the key difference of bitcoin with any other project in the world!
@_date: 2016-01-26 11:59:37
But nothing stops everyone to use 0-fee transactions! Then why not use it! The fee is not imposed by the client. You can override it!
Edit: What you are saying is not "imposed" on anybody on the network. Just think about it.

bitcoin is not yet there to "demand" even $0.03 of fee. i still use 0-fee. we need mass usage before bitcoin can demand any fee in my opinion. it has to prove its usefulness before demanding any fee.

@_date: 2016-03-23 13:53:42
but miners are still processing 0-fee transactions. because they know the network needs to prove itself first before demanding fee. till then they have the subsidy to live with. i am a happy 0-fee customer of the bitcoin network until i feel the pressure to use non 0-fee transactions.
Edit: infact my 0-fee transactions confirm in about 2--3 blocks :-D :-D :-D

sorry wrong (not until a larger than 1mb block is mined. you never know, most likely the block size will shrink during a hard fork as there won't be any mempool activity). nothing changes to them. please learn. it is segwit that pushes out all other nodes other than core 0.13 (now). that is what they call consenses! at 95%. educate yourselves. do not depend on core's word games!

I consider the current situation is the best thing to happen to bitcoin. It is NOT dysfunctional. What else do you think is decentralisation?

All developers will assemble back for the winning fork.

Rather than calling it "primitive", I see this solution as "scalable" either way and works for all the extreme cases. We don't have to switch to XT if we disagree and wait it out. Those who feel strongly for the switch in their own risk switch to XT. Others remain on Core. If Core is enough XT will work as Core alone. If miners don't mind increasing their limit and nodes don't mind confirming, Core will incorporate XT (decentralized development is beautiful). Then there is only Bitcoin. XT==CORE.
Sidechains can come in as and when available/required. Nothing can stop sidechains. That will be the next developmental fork which seems to already have consensus  for the idea throughout the world I guess.
BTW: There would be no suffering.

@_date: 2013-12-15 02:18:31
But do they accept fiat and pay in btc? as I thought they do only the reverse as the topic suggests here by OP!
@_date: 2013-11-26 10:21:46
good idea! but show us the path! very difficult!
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:10:29
if they get their hands on wallet.dat, they do get their hands on your bitcoins. They will be able to spend only if you had NOT encrypted the wallet!

I buy every month an amount that I do not mind losing. With a small 10% of my BTC try to ride the wave with very low margins! 90% of BTC is for long term never to sell even if it goes to 0.
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:57:27
From the way you have been responding here, you are too stupid with your money. You should never invest your money anywhere. Just save and spend your hard earned money. You get into bitcoin only when it becomes an established currency.

try your best. If possible move over to gnu/linux if you are familiar. bitcoins are too precious to be used on ms/windows! Try to solve with someone you trust on your machine itself who is aware of the bitcoin technology. Keep a safe backup of all your wallets in an encrypted form.
@_date: 2013-12-06 14:09:30
you determine the value of bitcoin if you can find a buyer for that value! This is what goes on in various exchanges!

keep it in bitcoin. no capital gains!

relax! bitcoin is going to rise and fall a few times. you should not worry about that. i guess you have invested only what you can afford to lose. that will solve all your problems.
@_date: 2013-11-16 03:27:22
That does not matter. Make a deal. Confirm escrow. Deposit cash (if not online transfer which also might take time when being done for the first time!) in the sellers' bank. Could be done from any city!
Remember to immediately confirm ``payment complete'' on localbitcoins.com!
Also begin with a small amount first to avoid mistakes!

Hope you (the transfering banks may have not) entered the necessary identifications numbers in the message of deposit as it could get easily lost in the many deposits that they receive! Write to their support with details of the date, time, amount, message etc for them to easily identify your deposit from the many others that they receive. This might help. It took me a week or two 6 months back!

You should risk around only 10% (0.2 of 2 BTC) for your temperament. You would not have this trouble then! Play on! You can give up if you lose all of 0.2 as you still hold 1.8 and you will be fine. Otherwise just keep buying $50 (even less) worth BTC every time you feel comfortable to lose $50!

If the wallet.dat is available without encryption from the program you have given away your vault open. No point in having an encrypted archive (like wallet.dat.zip which is password protected). On the other hand if there is no wallet.dat but only wallet.dat.your_encryption_extension then it is still safe to a certain extent.

I doubt if that is how companies work in reality though! stocks are just speculations just as what is happening in bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:06:30


why not? you cannot be adamant on how people view it. people can treat it as the future currency, investment, stocks, pump and dump. Remember no single entity has any control on it yet!
my suggestion is to invest, hold and if you can take the risks ride the waves to profit.
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:01:59
If you are in to only "sell" then you do not believe in bitcoin concept. That is why this forum has been hostile. BTW, no one is going to "tip" you :-P (you do not seem to take other tips)

Fantastic. You could send this splendid view for all on this "network" what you wanted to say but not allowed on the "show". This "audio--email" itself is an analogy to "fiat--bitcoin"!

That's good.
2. So you do not have the entire .bitcoin/ directory with you with the complete blockchain?
3. Use multibit which will not require you to download the blockchain.
4. The wallet.dat location should be known to the client (multibit or bitcoin-qt)

There would be 100s if not 1000s of customers like yours. They might have to close down if they have to service all of them! Trading is exactly that --- some people gain BTC, some people gain USD.

@_date: 2013-11-27 16:49:47

Put in the money that will not affect you --- if lost. You might be in for a 1000% surprise down the line. The idea should be to hope to use BTC as future currency and not a stock investment though it will double up as investment also!

trouble somewhere else. not necessarily localbitcoins. the buyer himself is accepting the mistake. and you are asking to show the animal instincts. I was just kidding btw.
Also someone had mistakenly sent me some btc without confirming from me on localbitcoins. He was desperate as I had not noticed this for 3 days. But when I saw this I did pay him. I think that helps this community. He did contact me several times later to sell me at a discount :-)
So, lets not be too greedy. It will help in the long run I guess!

you can decide (in agreement with the buyer) how much you need to be paid apart from advertising your exchange rate!

@_date: 2013-11-25 01:39:36
Many might be hoarding in the hope to "spend" it when it stabilises at a high value (not necessarily just cash out unless compelled). Most people would throw in only what they can afford to lose "in the hopes that it rises" and not necessarily "cashing out" but as a value for the future!

1. they are panicky and do not understand bitcoin
2. they may want to sell high and buy more low? profits... 
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:55:25
invest what you can afford to loose and 1. wait, 2. ride the wave and gain (or loose) till equilibrium and retire :-D
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:56:09
People who ride the wave and time it well convert 2BTC to 200BTC dear! Beware to use strong words! You might also end up like the one who converted 2BTC to 0.002BTC!
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:47:17
I am sorry. I might have been wrong there. BitPay seems accept bitcoin payments to be converted to fiat currency. In my opinion that is useless! for the moment for me.
People (merchants) can do that on their own on their website if they are interested in bitcoin anyway!
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:00:56
How do you know for sure it was not the other way around!
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:14:32
right now mt.gox is under tremendous buy pressure after the recent sell pressure. so it will take some time.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:35:38
much much before you predicted!
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:04:20
use "custom time" in 
@_date: 2013-12-12 14:27:49
I have enough in cash for christmas as I have accounted for it while buying into BTC. BTW, BTC news have only been great for me. What you said about "depressing" was actually the time I could buy more BTC :-D
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:42:33
@_date: 2013-11-16 03:55:51
Why are the opponents getting fragmented? Do they not have a real point? The doubt people are holding on is because it may be a ploy of the rich late commers to plough into the gains of bitcoin. By the way I would be happy to have the price plummet to buy as much as I can. But I am resisting that thought, which is what the greedy corporations are doing.
BTW, There are several methods to overcome such as mixing.
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:59:01
looks like you got into trouble recently and grinning! :-)
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:37:11
Use gnu/linux. It is several order of magnitude safer than ms/windows! Also it is like bitcoin versus fiat-currency.
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:20:29
@_date: 2013-12-27 08:57:05
If it is a little more than sell high and buy low with low margins, it will be helpful.
Edit: ofcourse only opensource will be of any worth though.
@_date: 2013-12-14 10:29:11
If I were the wikipedia owner, what better way to get donations other than bitcoins. But they still are only "considering". Huge loss for them. Why bother!
@_date: 2013-12-04 10:08:29
This guy (Joe Whatsall!) needs some sleep. Go sleep kid! You are worthless defending BTC. Please by joining BTC you are lowering its value!
@_date: 2013-11-23 11:26:14
it is the simplest you can get out there!
@_date: 2013-11-17 14:35:17
check out the wiki. the difficulty level comes down if people abandon mining and it would become profitable! an equilibrium could settle. in the long run though transaction fees *might* have to help mining.
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:19:40
You are safe. Still suggest you to do what "imbetter911" suggested
"Just move the money to another wallet and abandon."
Edit: Keep a copy (backup) of your old wallet. Be careful while moving to a new address (preferrably many addresses) in a new wallet.
@_date: 2013-11-30 07:45:05
even if a bug is noticed it is in the best interest of the community to inform the developers and correct the bug! After sufficient time it could be published and that will improve its legitimacy! Then it will rise again!
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:18:30
Either just hold it or ride the wave: buy low; sell high!
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:53:46
instead of calling himself a bozo, he is trying to suck up!

localbitcoins.com is pretty operational. But be careful. suggest escrow.

Looks like chicago, 
@_date: 2013-12-15 03:22:26
can you be a little more "illuminating" :-P
@_date: 2013-11-16 11:40:49
why not!
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:34:51
But it depends on: if you believe in BTC you will speculate and hoard BTC; If you believe in USD you will speculate and hoard USD; if you are on the fence you will try to have an increasing balance of both!
@_date: 2013-12-14 13:24:53
While it is dangerous to do this, hope you have protected by encrypting your wallet.dat in bitcoin-qt itself and are not leaving it alone for anyone to access.
@_date: 2013-12-15 06:35:57
@_date: 2013-12-06 15:53:33
I do not have fiat left to buy! sigh! :-(
@_date: 2013-11-23 12:15:14
so spend 500USD to buy 1BTC! now it is ~850USD btw :-D
you cannot compare it yet. the price discovery process has just begun!
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:13:32
The wallet only contains the private key to allow spending of the btc at the particular address (which is the distributed blockchain). If that key (wallet) is lost, the btc in the new address cannot be spent. that is all.
@_date: 2013-11-20 06:07:26
Everybody will do buy buy buy, then sell sell sell, then buy buy buy, then sell sell sell and on and on ... It is simple. It is all about timing!
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:19:28
Do not forget the service the foundation did for bitcoin in the past. Do not jump to conclusions too soon. Wait. If you really feel you can be the change. They know this much more than us. So, chill out.
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:19:51
Ask him to release the BTC corresponding to the 70 pounds if that is possible. It might require the lbtc-support intervention to make it reliable.
@_date: 2013-12-15 03:07:56
how? thought this is what the fed fears! In fact, bitPay which converts BTC to USD probably works for FED!
@_date: 2013-11-27 08:58:29
localbitcoins.com provides all security if you are vigilant. to experiment try free very small btc give aways at bitvisitor.com

Peter schiff is losing lot of credibility... but wait ... he might be hoarding BTC in the background and then ``change his mind'' like the stupid Joe Weisenthal (BTW, Joe Weis... never had any credibility though)!
@_date: 2013-11-23 13:02:05
as some of the recent news "you need a ponzi for a ponzi scheme". bitcoin per se does not yet have a ponzi (very difficult to have a ponzi)!
@_date: 2013-11-25 16:08:38
hey! it was just pun intended for the gold bugs ofcourse!

While he lost some respect when he pumped Quark, this time I will give it to him. He seems to trying to gain some of his lost reputation. He seems to be warning about what we just saw playing for the last few hours on the BTC markets. Seriously does look like manipulation as he warns.
@_date: 2013-11-16 02:36:27
What will you do if it goes to 3000?
@_date: 2013-11-18 21:50:48
Does not look like coming!
