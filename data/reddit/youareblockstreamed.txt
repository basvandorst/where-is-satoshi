When a BS liar says "we are forces to" or "we only have one shot". That means they deliberately wanna do some evil thing. Actually they are forced by the devil living in their fat ass. Typical Blockstream style.

Glad that you know you can't represent users with this hilarious UASF.

The whole point of Bitcoin is self validation. UASF folks have lost their minds.

Good enough. I hope BS make LTC great again.

Satoshi already told us how to scale.
Deliberately refusing any blocklimit lift proposal for years and then giving us their "only" solution accompanying with many other things related to their patents and telling us "this is the only tested scaling solution" are absolutely not acceptable.

Here u/nullc spammed lies again. I have debunked it detailedly in another sub. Newbies shall read my post before they are trapped by the shallow lies spammed by him.
Don't forget the fact that it's blockstream who actually pays u/nullc for these posts. If you haven't known yet or you don't believe, you shall inform yourself, instead of being brainwashed.

Nice try, blockstream shill.

This blockstream shill.

Look, Blockstream dictates.
Blockstream goes fully mad. This shows why SegWit is the Trojan Horse to attack Bitcoin.
