You forgot the /s
You realize that banks will process transactions in order to overdraft your account. Process deposits AFTER all of your withdrawals. Shady shit like that?
There was also a time where you could NOT turn off overdraft protection.

It's a CIVIL issue. You need to hire a lawyer. 
If you can't find a lawyer then you aren't looking hard enough. This seems like an open and shut case.
You lost out on BTC at 19K, BCH @ $2500, and all the shitcoins that followed.
Do not file a class action, even if you find 1000 people with the same issue. Class action suits money all goes to the lawyers.

Ya, and they also said the price wasn't going to stop at 20K but 200K. So fuck this bullshit article.

Unfortunately, Bitcoin doesn't support Paypal and never will.
Who gives a shit about paypal. They are just a giant scam. The operate outside of banking regulations because they claim they are not a bank.

And probably not even .000001% was real world transaction just 99.99999999% exchange transactions. More bullshit.
It's amazing how many stupid people think Bitcoin is actually being used to buy goods and services.

Everyone hates bank fees but Binance can steal all of your money and youre now happy about it? WTF?
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:01:07
They are liars just like Coinbase. 
Hoiw long does it take to get a fucking banking license? Why can Coinbase get a license in certain states but Gemini can't? Incompetence? Just keep an eye out on our page and sometime in the next 100 years your state will become available.

He got life for being one of the biggest drug dealers in the world. Like it or not that's what he was. He also tried to have people murdered to keep his status. Not much different between him and El Chapo, El Chapo just did it to more people and more ruthlessly. He is a piece of shit that got EXACTLY what he deserved.
He will live the rest of his life in jail. El Chapo will live the rest of his life in jail unless they manage to break him out. They both have the same effective sentence.

This seems to me like this CEO is about to be hit with a massive lawsuit and investigated by the SEC. If he doesn't sell the company he's in deep shit. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 17:07:33
Quality fucking article guys. Can't we just leave the scums fucks and piece of shit racists alone and not fucking talk about them, ever.

99% of street vendors and others shop uses a QR code linked to weibo. It's very similar to a crypto transaction.
@_date: 2018-07-24 00:14:40
The don't really accept local currency in cash either. They use weibo to transfer via QR codes. Watch some of the food videos in China and almost every single one you will see a QR code somewhere on their cart or door. I could have the app name wrong but they do a ton of transfers via QR codes and no cash.

What a complete load of horse shit.
@_date: 2018-07-19 19:10:55
just more bullshit manipulation but you all can act like it's a good thing.
