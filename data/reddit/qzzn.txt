Personally, I don't think it's very easy to earn levels. If I remember correctly, I have seen level 30s who have wagered tens, maybe even hundreds of bitcoins. Putting things into perspective, that is a lot of money compared to the meager increase of the amount of satoshis you receive from the faucet. +400 doge verify

How come several shibes who posted previously didn't get any tips? And also, this is the bitcoin reddit...

Since you mentioned there are many


I think you should cover the topic of security. 2FA, offline wallets, cold storage, etc.


Exactly. :)
Also, did you mention the use of bitcoin in social media?
Overall, it is well-written and has sufficient information for a newbie to get started.

Pretty cool, I have to admit. I'll check out the app and see if I like it. :P

I host a giveaway subreddit! :) I think it would be a nice idea to include bitcoin tipping there, too. :)
