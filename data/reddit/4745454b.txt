Take a look at the chart yourself, median is no way near 1,3. 
And also check the history of years when EUR has been very high compared to USD. At early 2000s there was the .com crash, and at 2009 there was the subprime mortgage crisis crash. 
When EUR is around 1,3 or above US is having yet another crisis.
@_date: 2019-07-12 19:36:39
That 1.35 or actually at best 1,5 was due to US dollar tanking due to sub prime mortgage crisis. 1,1-1,2 is the typical normal rate.

@_date: 2018-05-04 09:33:22
Sure. Check out IOTA ecosystem.
The whole point of IOTA is to provide machine to machine communications. Something on which current industrial protocols are rather horrible at, so even with a bit wonky crypto, IOTA is an enormous improvement.
Even as you obviously cannot use it to replace time critical communications, but it can act as verification ledger to detect unauthorized commands.
In short, IOTA actually has a practical use case. And peaked just when I decided to try other coins :/ Oh well, I hope my picks reach some level of parity and I can hop back to IOTA at least partially.

I would not classify IOTA as a shitcoin.
They have a dubious history on working with other cryptographers, although that was in my opinion a mutual catfight. And they have been a bit too experimental in their crypto.
At the same time they have been able to get very significant and credible industry partnerships.

And how many of those use Bitcoin? 
And does having an account count as user?
NYT subcribers actively read the newspaper, having a coinbase account that was used last time two years ago, is not exactly same. I have coinbase account, but I never have used it for Bitcoin, except the $10 signup bonus.
@_date: 2019-03-03 22:54:32
So basically the count of Bitcoin users is unrealistically inflated?
Based on that logic anyone who ever visited NY Times webpage is NYT user. 
Usually there is a minimum level of repetition required to get real counts. 
@_date: 2019-03-04 08:27:40
Also being a user of coinbase gives no indication of being a bitcoin user.
Coinbase offers a lot of coins, I for example have never bought bitcoin over there, the only Bitcoin thing I did was to convert referral bonuses to other coin :)
@_date: 2019-03-03 19:31:20
Mostly it seems to be about counting active addresses.
Which I would guess is vastly inflated way, but gives nice looking numbers. I would not be surprised that the number of actual human users is ten times less, if not hundred times less.
Of course if using Bitcoin once a year counts as a user, then figure may be bigger. I sometimes use it to transfer between exchanges, but I would in no way count myself as a bitcoin user.

Indeed, and once the coins with real world ties kick in, they also become independent of bitcoin swings.
Right now about the only use for Bitcoin is to act as a tether for traders when alt values go down. Without that I'd guess bitcoin would have really low volatility.
The big question is that which of the coins is the first one to get significant real world traction. My money is literally on IOTA, as it has the most well developed and credible partnerships. Other that I am looking at is Gladius, as their anti-DDOS network will be an economical system of it's own, and thus very likely to tear free from Bitcoin ties if and when they get software production ready and first customers.
@_date: 2018-10-31 06:14:45
So everything that is not BTC is a scam, right?
IOTA is a German nonprofit organization. Pulling that off as a scam would be quite a feat. Also it has the most advanced partnership network that of all cryptos at the moment. 
But whatever, enjoy your dinosaur. 
@_date: 2018-10-30 11:20:05
Well Bitcoin _is_ enormous energy hog for the ridiculously low transaction volume it is able to support. So they got that part right.
Remember that almost all of the Bitcoin trading happens in exchanges, which do not touch BTC blockchain at all. 
So the articles are right in the fact that in order to get real world adoption crypto has to evolve. Either Bitcoin dies off and gets fully replaced with cryptos that are capable of operating with 1% of Bitcoin energy consumption. Or Bitcoin will remain as exchange based commodity.
But as it is Bitcoin is not viable as anything else than speculative commodity.
If there is any ulterior motive behind these articles, it is preparing the general public to accept that Bitcoin is going to way of the dinosaurs, hopefully without killing all the rest of cryptos with it.
Of course the alternative would be that Bitcoin developers get off their arse and come up with less energy intensive consensus mechanism. But attitudes look horribly fossilized.

What is going on that people either have learned not to panic, or ones that are prone to constant panic have given up and sold out. And thus each pump cycle ends up with bottom price that is higher than bottom before pump. At least for coins that are not total BS and hot air. 
Right now it is a game of patience.

Well. Bitcoin has not been doing so stellar lately.

@_date: 2018-06-11 10:22:49
The users who make transactions.
In IOTA every wallet that does transactions is either a light node, or does offload processing to a node. When you make a transaction, you have to verify two transactions.
And thus no heavy mining infra is needed.

The key word is “if” no major currency has really crashed since 80s. And due to current level of financial automation is unlikely to do so alone.

Mining is already concentrated in countries with cheapest electricity, namely China.
According to this 81% of BTC mining is done in China.
And if we look at recent mining pool distribution, situation seems to be roughly the same as in that article.
So the point where BTC value and mining electricity cost meet is surprisingly uniform. And that may lead to interesting effects.


Until they cannot afford to mine anymore, it all depends how much currency those miners have that is not in BTC.

And is ridiculously inefficient. 
With Bitcoin transaction volume you would not run even a midsize US city.

IOTA tangle is a graph which means it can be pruned. For example CARIOTA project has auto pruning node that can run on a raspberry Pi zero. 
Also the kind of manipulation you describe would not work as you can prune while downloading. It’s a graph you don’t need the whole to verify. Unlike chain where every link is critical.

At the moment, but that is due to majority attack protection they are using. While at the same time other small projects get hit by 51% attacks.

Not with bitcoin that’s for sure. Unless bitcoin evolves from the abysmal energy hog it is right now.

The cost of electricity may however be the death point of bitcoin. Of course when miners stop, the difficulty factor decreases, but it can also lead to death spiral.
Interesting times, let's see what happens.
I was expecting Bitcoin to already disappear from Europe as it is not GDPR compliant,  but that has not happened  yet, unless it is one of the reasons behind current drop. Timing does seem to match with GDPR becoming enforceable.

@_date: 2018-06-20 03:23:27
Then we would have to also count the ASIC production costs, smartphones that people use for payment, etc, to get a true apples to apples comparison. 
Oh and of course multiply current bitcoin energy use by volume difference to match number of fiat users and fiat volume. With Bitcoin volume you would not even run one midsize US city. 
No matter which way you look at it BTC is an abysmal energy hog. There are low power cryptos like IOTA which have a chance to make it big, BTC would need redesign from ground up. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:39:36
Why did you dredge EOS on this?
If that is your argument then I think we are done with this discussion. 
I was of course referring to coins like Nano, Ethereum, etc. And then coins like IOTA that do not have dedicated miners at all, since you verify two transactions when making one. Granted there are nodes for ultra light which devices, but those you can run on a Raspberry Pi clone. 
And that Bitcoin mechanism has not really been tested since 2009, and a lot of coins have been mined since that. I would not be that sure how it’s going to work. 
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:37:33

@_date: 2018-06-13 12:07:41
The way I am seeing it, this dip is going to wipe out a lot of coins that have no real world tie in, or tie in to anything at all.
Which means that of altcoins the ones that survive are ones that are associated with something tangible, or at least have big corporate packers who have tangible things in the works. 
Now the big question is that will Bitcoin itself survive? Outside of being a store of value and a method of buying altcoins, everything else it has is peanuts. Some shops accept Bitcoin as payment, but same shops also accept at least Ethereum.
And what will the market look like if Bitcoin is gone. And how long it will take for whatever survives from top-10 to reach meaningful levels again?
@_date: 2018-06-12 03:29:57
There is no technical  reason for that locking up. That sounds just a deflationary price control method. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 19:27:39
You misunderstood me.
Of course it is a bear market, but Bitcoin due to it's energy consumption is a bit special case. As with current amount of coins mined you need a lot of fiat money to pay for the energy bills that running Bitcoin takes.
More modern coins are planned to scale back down if the number of miners drop, but I and pretty much no one else knows for sure how Bitcoin will behave.
So death spiral is one possible scenario, I hope that it won't be a likely one.
@_date: 2019-10-12 18:37:20
You need to practice your reading comprehension :)
How on earth you interpreted that as me claiming it being BTC only issue. The reason why I mentioned BTC is the article that this post is about. Non-seizability does not really exist for BTC or anything else, when the cops don't play by rules.

Even really ancient ATMs draw around 250W when idling, which they do most of the time, and at max 410W when dispensing.
To compare that against 1350W power consumption of Antminer 9, which is about the most common Bitcoin mining ASIC is ridiculous.
I would assume that Forbes would require at least some level of fact checking.
@_date: 2018-06-20 04:08:06
For example how IOTA does it. I mean when their network is fully operational, not the current development time security coordinator. 
In IOTA model each node verifies two transactions which are selected randomly. And thus with large enough network it is extremely improbable to be able to that selection to land in nodes that are under your control. 
The trick is that since each node is also a transaction verifier, and there are going to be hundreds of millions of them. For one entity to be able to create enough fake nodes becomes unfeasible. And until that they use the coordinator. 
As I wrote previously, it would require BTC redesign from ground up. But there are solutions where POW is small enough to be calculated in couple seconds with a phone. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 10:26:56
Like what kinds of claims, the way I see is that people are loading a ton of expectations and demands to rather new project, and are impatient in seeing those things to get completed.

Thermorectal cryptoanalysis is a Russian equivalent of rubber hose cryptoanalysis. That is torturing one who knows the secret, rather than breaking algorithm. 
Thermorectal cryptoanalysis was done by inserting a cold soldering iron to victims rectum (asshole), and switching on power and waiting until the victim tells the secret. There are claims that KGB used the method, but there are no confirmed cases.
Probably placing the soldering iron on to table of interrogation room would have been enough in most cases :)

Scarcity by itself is not a parameter, there things that are more rare than gold and still have much less value. And diamonds are actually not that rare and still have value.


That is not true, there are a plenty of cases where criminals have been caught and Bitcoins have been confiscated. In Finland there actually was a case where state auctioned confiscated Bitcoins


This is not any more certain than possessing physical gold or cash. Once you have the gold, you have possession of it. It is true that Bitcoins are more certain than a bank accounts, but they are not any more certain than having a physical thing in your possession.

True, in the long run the only coins I expect to have value are ones that have ecosystem of their own.
Sooner or later we start seeing some of the coins to start having independent value, and not being moved by BTC anymore. What is tough is guessing which coins these are going to be, and what is the optimum time to buy.
Right now I am looking which coins had low transaction volume during this bloodbath.

Not true, almost every blockchain is built so that all past transactions are readable, that is kinda the whole point in blockhain.
You must have seen all those nice transaction visualizations, and stories how transactions have been traced through Bitcoin or other popular blockchain implementation.
That alone is a proof that most if not all blockchains are in violation of GDPR. 
Also pseudonymization works only when only authorized parties can translate bitcoin addresses back to identities. And this is not true for Bitcoin and other implementations, make a transaction with someone, and that someone knows your bitcoin address, and can then read your entire transaction history from blockchain.
Also in top of that tons of people have published their bitcoin addresses, which means that Bitcoin blockchain is full of non-pseudonymous PII.
I don't have bitcoin, so I don't really care what happens. But the result will be very ugly when EU privacy officer starts to make moves after end of April. So I try to warn people that something ugly is coming soon.

The way things are brewing, Bitcoin is not the one to trigger the next bull run. There are several projects maturing and gaining real world customer base, and after that the value of those coins is determined in fiat, not in BTC.
For example Brave browser has probably well over 5 million users, the last verified number was 4.6 million in early October. That is 5 million people using crypto in real world ecosystem, and Brave adoption rate keeps increasing.

I checked and there is this tab "include in auto-contribute" when you click the BAT triangle in desktop version, and if you switch that off for reddit, then Reddit does not get any coins that would otherwise be distributed at end of the month.
@_date: 2018-11-06 08:52:31
Remember that "mining" is needed also for verifying transactions. And that scales with the network size. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 05:23:10
Buying a coin without major real wolrd usecase is not smart. Look at top 20 alts, the ones with clear use case weathered BTC crash quite ok, and are already climbing back to their previous levels. While BTC remains down. 
“Store of value” does not cut it anymore. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:04:14
I deal with GDPR. 
Transaction information is personal information. 
And they can sue anyone who processes blockhain. That is miners, visualizers, etc.

Well more than half of the power in China is produced with coal. I would not be so cavalier about Bitcoin power consumption. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 11:27:19
Well using that analogue, checks have been discontinued in where I live, and pretty soon they are discontinued in whole Europe. 
Also BTC vs newer coins is more like magnetic stripe cards vs chip cards. Magnetic stripe is all but dead nowadays. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 16:15:46
You think like a coiner, not like regular user. 
User is not expected to do any KYC, they just use the coins directly from browser. 
Sure you can try to game it, fraud exists in every ecosystem. But since you need running browser instances, the ROI from fraud is not exactly mind blowing. 
Also there are other aspects than just whether user is paid for ads, ad matching is done locally. So unlike Google, your privacy is not for sale. Each browser is a separate “person” unless you sync them, which can’t be done right now. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:51:19
No they can’t 
They will try to deflect, or claim that otherwise the power would be wasted. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:50:21
Brave browser has something over 5 million users and BAT has 200M market cap. Which makes about $40 per user, while typically advertising related user is worth $150. 
Of course that applies more strongly once they have the advertising platform ready. 
@_date: 2018-11-18 20:59:39
Says someone spamming exactly same comment on every post about this. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 12:10:21
That nobody is increasing all the time. They have been gaining more than million users per month. 
And it’s not like you are supposed to cash the coins in the browser. That’s unidirectional. 
You can dislike it as much as you want, but momentum has started. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 17:23:59


Yes I did, since claiming something to be a pinnacle of technical evolution, is a surefire way to get a nasty surprise down the road.
Also like with anything else in tech, being good enough is what tends to win rather than perfect at one aspect and totally rotten in other.

That is the power of hindsight. 
Everytime you sell and rebuy your tax profits are calculated from lower point. Thus letting go after drop makes no sense, and if you can predict drops, my hats off to you. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 13:26:50
Because the Canadian court is about whether the person is extradited to USA. 
From OPs article you can see that same process was also followed in this Romanian case. That is the presenting proof step I mentioned in my original comment. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 11:23:12
I am not saying Bitcoin is useless, what I am saying is that it is enormously wasteful. Something I do not approve of.
@_date: 2018-11-05 11:32:57
Only fool shorts in a market that is easily manipulated by powerful players. It takes only short time pump to trigger shorts, and as we have seen those can be easily arranged when there is enough money on shorts to be looted.
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:25:48
If one wants to steal, not getting noticed is kinda important. Otherwise the loot loses value. 
Also as I mentioned coordinator is just a signing notary. You cannot forge anything with it. You also need to have hashing power majority to enable double spend. And then subvert coordinator to prevent it from doing it’s job. 
So such attack is really far from trivial. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:51:42
Those are minority power sources especially in where mining is done. 
@_date: 2018-11-16 05:24:41
At $750 you still could use bitcoin for small payments. Now mining fees will make that pointless. BTC is increasingly useless and that shows. 
Let’s say I want to tip a dollar, even at slowest transaction speed that is going to cost 14 cents. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 19:09:43
That does not make the miners hands clean, it's the same excuse used by any exploiter.
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:25:29
I am sorry what I am telling you is unpleasant to hear, but bear with me.
I assume that you consider the amount of your money in your fiat banking account as private information, also I assume that you consider all the transactions you have ever made with that account to be private information.
Let's assume that I boy something from you from ebay and I pay to you. If I pay with banking transfer, paypal or other method, the only thing I get from you is your banking ID or paypal ID. I do not see the contents of your account.
Now, if I pay with bitcoin, I get your wallet bitcoin address, and with that I can see all transactions done with that wallet. And that is violation of GDPR.


That analog is flawed. I crying out my name or even my bank account number, does not allow anyone to read my transaction history.


GDPR is aimed at _anyone_ processing material that contains personal information. Which is why it is totally mind-boggling how little this is talked about. I guess that this is the elephant in the room that nobody wants to talk about, because the truth is too horrifying to think about.
Edit: Here is a clear explanation what GDPR is about.
@_date: 2019-01-28 12:29:15
Just like yours is empty blabbering as you are not even providing a source for your statement :)
Take a look at SEC decisions yourself, there is not a single serious project among them. 
And in case of Brave it is even more clear, Brave is a company it has shares. How on earth could BAT be a securities offering for Brave?
@_date: 2018-11-06 10:21:08
Coal and gas are not unfortunately going anywhere in regions where Bitcoin is mostly mined :(
Nuclear energy is flexible, not as rapid as coal or gas, but it is adjustable.
And many renewable energy forms are flexible, hydro being the prime example.
As it is now, until solar becomes really big, all our our majority sources are flexible. And finite resources, if you run hydro full tilt, you will run out of water until it replenishes.
@_date: 2018-11-23 08:25:21
A bit more than 5 million people disagree with you :)
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:27:18


Nope, how it goes is that your name and address in sellers record is sellers personal information, since he was part of the transaction.
When you request account deletion, it covers every information that is owned by your account. Sellers record says that he did transaction X with person Y, that is his information.


I assume that you are referring to processing information outside EU. They do not have technical means, they have fines. Any company who gets caught personal information generated in EU area outside of EU area will be fined big time.
Why do you think that every major company nowadays has data centers in EU, it is not only for load balancing and access speeds.
@_date: 2018-11-06 19:08:54
That sounds like a the worst damn design ever, normal power dams have this thing called flow control, which also controls how much energy is produced at any given moment.
@_date: 2018-11-06 17:04:34
As I said Bitcoin and it’s community are unwilling to evolve. And thus Bitcoin is a prime target for disruption and will die as soon as any of the alternatives have enough proof. 
@_date: 2019-01-13 10:03:37
Are you sure, I have the impression that certain crypto fananatics may not have that high personal hygiene :)
@_date: 2019-01-27 13:02:56
Real world transaction volume, and of course funds in the lightning nodes.
Brave has tens of millions $US in actual use thanks to user growth pool airdrops and people using those for tipping.
With LN there is enough funds maybe to run a coffeeshop.

It is actually surprising how close minded people are even on crypto forums.
A venture capitalist? Do you think that this is 1999 and not 2019?
Tokens are a new model to fund projects, which are a lot easier for small investors than traditional models.


That is the risk in investing into tokens, on the upside the possibility for gains is a lot more than in owning stocks, since the token is a part of the ecosystem that is used by advertisers to buy ADs and then to pay users for watching them.
Theoretically Brave project could roll out a new token anytime, but at the same time they would crash their customer base and their value. So owning shares would not give any additional protection. Worthless share of a failed company is just as worthless as token is. I have experienced that first hand when a local mining company failed, and I mean real mining not crypto mining :)


What SEC is doing is excellent, yet at the same time Brave has nothing to fear from them, since they did take proper care how to do things.
And since BAT ROI from ICO price is still at 590%, I kinda suspect that initial investors are not that keen on "getting their funds back", if they still have any token left.
Also about SEC crackdowns, you might want to actually read why SEC has taken action on some ICOs. After all they do post very clear explanations.
For example let's take this gem.


Or this one


Or this


SEC actions are against outright scams, or against of using a token as a security, which Brave is not doing. Brave company has shares and BAT is a clearly differentiated token for Brave AD economy.
@_date: 2018-11-25 16:09:25
Hanging in there. 
Now that is morbid :)
@_date: 2019-01-27 12:41:34
You hit nail in the head why Brave is likely to succeed, while any project based on already valuated coin would fail.
Brave printed their own "free" tokens which allowed two important things:
 * They got funds to pay the development team
 * They can do airdrops to users, or in Brave terms token grants, which help to kickstart the BAT economy
@_date: 2019-01-27 15:59:11
BAT is not in anyway permanently chained to ERC20, if they need to they can transition to any other layer 1 system and issue token swap. Just like any project that has left ERC20 to build their own mainnet.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:43:28
Isn't it so that a majority of blockchains don't provide anonymity?
Is there any mainstream coin that does so?
@_date: 2019-01-06 09:12:55
They probably picked this one exactly due to low volume. It is totally different if they can prove that say 15% of volume is crime related. Compared to 0,01%. The latter has plausible deniability the former doesn’t. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:50:44
So it’s Chinese governments fault?
Nice deflection. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:25:30
Not true. 
BTC is in direct violation of GDPR. As soon as you publish your bitcoin address somewhere, for example to get donations for open source project, it becomes an identifier for personally identifying information. 
PII that is available to anyone who has blochain, which means that blockhain is a PII store. And this toxic for EU based operations. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 09:52:48
There seems to be misconception about energy production. 
Only certain energy sources have energy output that cannot be controlled, those being wind and solar. 
Other forms, especially coal and gas are run to match demand. So on those there is no extra energy to benefit from. 
And since wind and solar are minority power sources, with the exception of Iceland there is no waste energy to be used for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 10:17:08


Bitcoin and Ethereum keys are Elliptic Curve keys yes, but this does not mean that every other currency would also use ECDSA.
Which is why I mentioned the general purpose storage that ledger devices are capable of.


That is true, Apples Secure Enclave does not allow import or export, and to be able to sync multiple devices, also import capability would be rather important.
@_date: 2019-01-06 17:12:04
Reading comprehension is not your strong points I take it :)
Extradition is possible only when there is a treaty, treaties require trust, faking evidence destroys trust. Countries that are even suspected of ever faking evidence or any kind of incompetence do not get treaties. 
Earlier in the chain I commented that US Secret Service is super diligent with evidence in extradition cases. Just like any other country that has any extradition treaties in place. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 08:20:26
I wonder how long it will take for mobile phone manufacturers to expand their security enclave systems to support crypto currency private keys?
Right now these separate ledger devices have a market niche, since for example Apple Secure Enclave supports only Elliptic curve private keys. But sooner or later vendors are going to add ledger like general purpose key storage.
@_date: 2018-11-06 11:03:22
The point is that there is a very big shortage of carbon neural energy sources. 
Right now most of our energy production is carbon positive, and thus Bitcoin is a frivolous waste as it is. 
There is nothing misleading in energy consumption argument. To claim otherwise is Trump level denial. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:36:15


You are wrong about that. Bitcoin blockchain is a ledger of transactions, that's the whole point of blockchain. 
For example here is transactions of Daniel Quinn, some open source developer.
The fact that I can read those transactions just by knowing the Bitcoin address is a violation of GDPR. Assuming that Daniel would live in an EU country.
You can use bitcoin in a manner that would give some anonymity, but that is not done by default it does not matter in legal sense.


If you do anything that processes blockchain you are a processor by GDPR, but you are right, officials will go after exchanges and miners first.
@_date: 2019-01-06 16:51:43
Umm, you missed the point that I have to violate Singaporean law within Singaporean jurisdiction. 
The reason why this Romanian could be extradited was the fact that he is suspected of laundering crypto connected to a crime within USA jurisdiction. 
Using your example, if I would pretend to be a lawyer and offer my services online to Singapore. Yes then I could be requested for extracting provided that Singaporean authority has proof and the crime is significant enough. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 16:54:12
So then Bitcoin will die, when any of the alternative algorithms are proved to be strong enough. Well then, good riddance.
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:54:30
Muahahaha. 
Sorry, but that’s not going to happen. Entire industries in EU have revised their operation in an effort that has taken almost 5 years. 
GDPR as it is is to stay. It’s coin industry’s problem that they have ignored it.

@_date: 2019-01-06 13:22:37
Yes but the criminal investigation started from US so the money laundering they are associated must be related to that. 
Can be as they are tracking Bitcoins used to pay ransoms, so it may be as simple that the tainted coins were cashed in at this exchange. 
Which is why Binance, Coinbase and others will lock your account in nanoseconds if you transfer in tainted coins.

Looks like someone has repurposed ancient bit coin miner as a space heater. Not a bad idea :)
Although in practice I don't know whether that runs any useful loads without an Internet connection, and that would be a bit unusual in a trailer. Unless it is in a trailer park.
@_date: 2019-01-06 09:06:05
They can do that only if said person is suspected of crime that affects USA. But remember that these arrangements are bidirectional, hack a Romanian system from USA, and you will get detained by FBI and shipped to Romania if FBI is presented with proof by Romanian authorities that will convince FBI. 
Do note US Secret service is super diligent in obtaining and presenting proof. They have a reputation to maintain, and they are making really sure they are worth it. 
@_date: 2018-11-06 12:07:19
Which means Bitcoin is likely die as it is unwilling to evolve. 
Which was my original point. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 17:25:58
I might agree on the first point.


But this claim does not give you much credibility. In general I have yet to meet a maximalist that would be knowledgeable on anything. Fundamentalisim and knowledge are rarely found on same person.
@_date: 2018-11-06 09:12:29
I have looked at bitcoin mining difficulty, and I know that it also scales somewhat down theoretically. 
However "theoretically" is a pretty poor comfort.
What we are seeing is a kind tragedy of commons, since there is nothing to restrict mining, people will mine so that energy consumption is enormously wasteful due to mining difficulty scaling by hash power. And if miners drop, they are unlikely to do it in a controlled manner.
As I wrote above, there are a plenty of solutions available, but I doubt BTC community is willing to implement anything. Things look very stagnated and attitudes fossilized.
@_date: 2019-01-27 12:53:27
Well, he is BTC maximalist, what do you expect?
@_date: 2018-03-08 20:42:30
Owning BTC will most likely not be an issue.
But any BTC operations in EU will be violation of GDPR. 
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:26:59
Yes it does. Anyone who uses blockhain is hosting it.
Otherwise shady companies would bypass GDPR with blockhain. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 12:26:00
I have been thinking the same.
I just wish there would be a way to bleed those coins unnoticed, right now it is not worth the effort.
@_date: 2019-01-06 12:39:57




That is in no way near the truth, Status Of Forces agreement means that NATO service members are tried in court martial of their own country. And court martial is no childs play. Also there are no stipulation about silence, as you can see from South Korean case described in Wikipedia article.

Can I get source code for that Bridge, I can get it for Brave. 
So I can verify what Brave does. For example I can easily check what data is collected and what is sent upstream. 
And obviously they have sanity checks on the data, so forgery is a lot more untrivial than some MMO cheat. 
And you can keep throwing reasons all you want. 
Brave adoption rate tells me different story. But stay in denial all you want. 
@_date: 2019-01-27 16:02:36


That someone also needs to fund the ecosystem, which means that someone needs to have couple hundred millions to invest.
Why BAT is picking off, is the fact that Brave has user growth pool funds to serve as airdrops, which kickstarted the tipping ecosystem.
Good luck getting people to put any of their own money into tips before they are comfortable in using the system.
Bitcoin or Ethereum based tipping system would be dead in the water. And would be very unlikely to pick any speed.
@_date: 2019-01-06 12:53:45
This is not how international laws works. You go to the court in the country whose laws are broken. 
Launder money for French criminals and off to France you go. 
Also do note that this obviously is a continuation of some other criminal investigation, most likely some ransomware gang, so since USSS started the case they are to the ones to finish it and get to send these warm invitations to US. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 15:39:43
Oh yes I can. But this is why Coinbase and other big exchanges have hair trigger reaction for locking accounts. 
@_date: 2019-01-29 04:19:25
Maybe you start first by understanding what a security is and what it is not. A security is a representation of something, a stock, a stock option, a government bond, etc. 
After you understand that, you might want to check what is the common theme in tokens that SEC has taken an action on. You know case law and all that, when building a set of cases they need to be diverse as possible 
A BAT token does not represent anything, it is just a token. 
But anyways I am done with you, have a good day. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 11:35:10
Unfortunately not. 
Otherwise every shady company would have that buried in the contracts.

Assuming that Monero does not have same privacy issue, that is a valid option.

You are showing a prime example of being unwilling to evolve.
Ever increasing Bitcoin energy consumption is going to mean that Bitcoin will fail sooner or later. And if there is no willingness to figure out alternative consensus and valuation methods, then it is bye bye Bitcoin.

Correct, with GDPR if you close your Paypal account you can request deletion of all of your personal data.

That picture is such bullshit, and I am not referring to Bitcoin in it. 
Do you think Taxi centers own Taxis. No they don’t so why should Uber?
Do you think Ebookers or Booking.com owns hotels? Then why should AirBnB. 
Goods brokers do not own goods, why should Alibaba fo?
Everything in the above except Bitcoin is just the latest generation of previously existing business ideas refined a bit further. About the only new thing is that they were able to fool people that they are something new and different.

It’s you who does not get the point. 
Other than bitcoin, those examples are same old. 
Right now we are staying at holiday apartment rented from a private person using Booking.com. Like I have done for 10 years already. Booking.com has existed since 1996.

In analytics there is no such thing as wrong assumptions, provided that results are correct. Did I not already explain it once. 
Financial analysis is totally different compared to engineering and other physical sciences. 
In financial predictions you don’t care about methods, you care about accuracy and usable lifetime of the results. 
After all otherwise you would not be able to use machine learning. Since every ML model is full of assumptions by correlation, which are almost always invalid. But deliver correct results for a duration.

Sorry to disappoint, but when it comes to device security, Google is not nearly on the same level. And why would they, they are not a device vendor, every phone sold under Google brand is made by some other company and act only as reference devices.
Also do take a look at the Cellebrite list Samsung is supported up to S8 models.

I think other coins are just waiting for BTC to die.
Other projects have real world use cases, so while they would momentarily crash really badly when BTC dies, they would regain their market cap due to real world usecases.
Personally I would not mind such situation, I would definitely scoop more after the crash stabilizes.
For example Iota Foundation has significant fiat cash reserves and corporate backers, they will be fine for a couple years, no matter where IOTA token collapses to.

Take a look at list of supported Android phones where Cellebrite mobile forensics tool is able to extract data.
A good Android phone is nicer to use, and more versatile with hardware support, but when it comes to securing a device from unwanted access, Apple is the king.

Do you really know so little about BTC history. 
The price started to rise when there were other coins in exchanges to trade with. Otherwise it would still be 10K BTC for a pizza.

BTC alone would be nowhere near it is now, it needs alts as trading partners. Only idiots do not realize that.

The only ones with any hope aim to totally different use cases.

Is need all you understand?
Nobody needs Bitcoin either when it comes to it. 
The way to get users is to give them something they want to use, not trying to force them.

Actually they put what they fear.

Obviously engaging other than people who are not aware of crypto. 
The projects that have hope don't rely on people hoarding the coin, it engages millions of regular users, and the value is created through coin being used in whatever ecosystem they are creating.  
Brave and BAT are good example of that, they have about 10 million installs on Android, and 6 million more on PC. And the install and thus user counts are growing daily. And with that number of users the ecosystem has already value. And if and when it increases to hundreds of millions, things get really interesting.

I haven't had any issue I always use VPN on my phone, and no issues in connecting with Binance whatsoever.
Being Finnish I use F-Secure Freedome, since it is a local company and has a good reputation.

If you were at profit when you sold you lost more than that. Now a percentage of your gains belongs to tax man. 
Better pay it up or be really confident that tax office cannot get your transactions from exchange.

And what you wrote is not really the truth either.
Average car in 2018 is quite a bit bigger and more complex than 1981. So it costing more in working hours should not a surprise either.
2018 equivalent of 1981 car is probably cheaper in working hours.

Dude. User does not care whether it’s hardware or software that gets compromised. Some of the Cellebrite hacks are pure hardware, but mostly they are various driver hacks. That is when any hacking is needed as all. 
Right now, like it or not, Apple is the most reliable when it comes to protecting the device as a whole package. And as a downside you get a phone that you can’t tinker with.

That was true before audited stablecoins. Increasing number of alts are traded either against stable or ETH. 
Just take a look at market breakdowns.

Of course it has but I also follow BTC forum since not everyone here is a toxic asshole.
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:08:06
Such blind fanaticism :)
@_date: 2019-05-03 20:37:11
Indeed, it is quite apparent that you have not followed any project that has active customer base, I mean people outside cryprosphere.
But that is totally your loss.
@_date: 2019-05-15 04:49:31
And obviously totally head in the sand I see. 
BTC value is set by trading, and that is not against fiat, it is against other crypto.

Google does not make Pixel, they are made by Foxconn. 
Pixel 2 models were made by HTC and LG. 
When it comes to security I don’t know any Android that would be on the same level as iPhones. Apple simply invests more due to wanting to force all devices to use Apple AppStore. While Google allows third party stores and thus has no need for same level of neurotic lockdown.
