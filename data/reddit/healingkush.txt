So guys, It's been 5 days. No coins back. I have begun to accept that I must now hire somebody to retrieve my coins for 50-100 dollars. I feel like a total noob.
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:34:27
I still haven't got them back and it's been 5 days.

I downloaded Copay for iphone. I chose Advanced --- Sweep Paper Wallet---  then I used the WIF compressed key and scanned it in.
This was sent directly to my copay wallet.
Unconfirmed, but it worked. Says it sent with a 0.0001 BTC fee or something.

Oh! I read "I was" not "I wasn't"
Sorry!!! But I do accept that I am a noob idiot.

First of all, It's now 5 days in and my coins have not returned.
Second of all, I restored my wallet using the Wallet.Dat back up and now I reinstalled bitcore (latest version) and resynched it. (my download internet speed is 200mb/s) 
None of this worked.
I don't know how to dump my transactions or reset them
I dont know any of that stuff and am too scared to do it.
I dont know what to do anymore but wait and PRAY THAT MY BITCOINS COME BACK.
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:30:56
It will not be returned. My wallet was corrupeted, I restored it with Wallet.dat and then its synching again right now.
However upon further research, it can stay unconfirmed permanently.
@_date: 2016-06-03 19:19:43
Coin... You have gone above and beyond to help someone as clueless as me... 
If I wait, will it eventually be returned or do I have to do this? 
People say it eventually gets returned.. But I don't know about that
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:52:29
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:12:14
I'll check it out real quick. Can you confirm that cointastical is giving me correct information with Zapwallettxes and rescan?
@_date: 2016-06-05 08:35:23
I understand it is hard to explain on reddit. But Please man. I don't have many options. Recently I've been asking people at the gym sauna if they know about bitcoin.
I just don't know what to do. Even youtubed it and get confused.
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:32:11
The fee isnt what killed me. I dont care if i have to pay a 50 dollar fee. The money isnt the problem. It's the fact that everytime I wanna buy a bitcoin I gotta drive to LA. 
Spend 500 bucks or so. 
It's an annoying process I don't wish to repeat. 
The bitcoin core version I use is the ABSOLUTE latest one.
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:52:19
Guys, I double spent it, but still no confirmations
@_date: 2016-06-05 08:33:39
I know you were referring to me Mark, Call me an idiot, call me a moron. I don't care. I just was seeking help.
@_date: 2016-06-04 16:17:37
I am using QT VERSION 5.5.0 and the Bitcoin still has not been returned to my wallet . It's sitting unconfirmed as of May 31. 
On June 7 I will consider this Bitcoin permanently lost. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 15:00:47
By the way, on a side note, how do I turn off email notifications every time somebody responds or comments? 
That's annoying....
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:33:53
If I knew man. I would've used something much simpler with a higher fee.
I just googled bitcoin wallet and its the first damn thing that came up.
@_date: 2016-06-05 01:09:11
Coin, I am running the LATEST version of bitcoin core.
Can I just wait for my coins to return to me? This is gonna be the 5th day I believe.
@_date: 2016-06-02 22:53:28
I have tried copy and pasting this every single way possible and I cannot for the life of me figure out how to zapwallettxes
@_date: 2016-06-06 02:44:34
Very true thank you
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:31:14
i swear to god I didnt touch anything man. I wouldve increased the fee if anything. I didnt even know about a fee to begin with.
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:26:56
Are you sure? how long will it take??
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:34:10
Please do. I hate the fact that I accidentally downloaded an advanced client.
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:52:04
@_date: 2016-06-03 10:59:50
Coin, 
I have tried my best to find and copy and paste the file path into the run command to run the Bitcoinqt.. 
I just simply don't know what to type, and in what order. 
I'll have to wait for the transaction to be denied and return to my wallet.. Which I heard for some people could be forever.. Unless they're familiar with how to reset it themselves. 
I feel so stupid I wanna die. Wasted like 300 bucks almost just to throw my Bitcoin into the void 
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:34:16
I wish I knew!
@_date: 2016-06-05 08:44:49
Is this possible without MYCELLIUM?
I do not have an android!
@_date: 2016-06-05 20:01:22
COINTASTICAL HELPED ME GET IT BACK!
@_date: 2016-06-05 18:05:53
I am so confused as well my friend. I don't know why I have this kind of luck.
@_date: 2016-06-05 03:34:39
All of this is in the post.
@_date: 2016-06-02 21:36:11
Thank you sir. 
@_date: 2016-06-02 21:39:11
Can  you PLEASE type what I need to copy and paste into my command prompt in order to do it if my wallet is located on my desktop in a folder called "Bitcoin Wallet"
@_date: 2016-06-02 16:18:26
Coin, 
What is bitcoin qt? What is zapwallet? What is rescan? 
If I choose to wait, how long shall I wait before the coin comes back to me?
I swear when I say this... I mean it... I'm RETARDED scared when it comes to moving my Bitcoin around. I just always think it's gonna vanish (in this case it did) 
I am
Using the most current synced version of Bitcoin core,  i use that wallet cause I think it is the best Wallet and it said my computer can help the block chain.
@_date: 2016-06-05 20:01:43
THANK YOU SIR!
@_date: 2016-06-02 18:15:57
Can you please not use abbreviations, I am sorry, I cannot understand what "Cd to the directory" means
Does that mean Copy? or put a CD in?
@_date: 2016-06-04 15:37:14
I downloaded my Bitcoin qt client a few days ago, a week tops maybe, that SHOULD be the latest release am I not right? 
And I literally just am so bad with computers that I cannot do the steps you provided without messin up or getting stuck. 
My computer can't find path files and it's driving me crazy 
I just want my Bitcoin back. 
So sad ��
@_date: 2016-06-02 19:15:10
wait what?&gt;
what is OP?
@_date: 2016-06-02 14:54:53
Thank you for responding Mwo12, you seem to have a helpful response and don't bash me for being a noob who uses bitcoin core. 
I want to apologize first hand for my noob behavior and I bow down to the based god of pros of bitcoin. 
However, until I become worthy, any assistance would be amazing. 
I basically am just scared the Bitcoin won't be returned to my wallet. 
I'm an IDIOT for not sending it with a fee. Now I feel like it will be lost in the block chain limbo for decades. 
Regardless, it's a minuscule amount, so I'm glad I could learn my lesson this way. 
As far as those asking me for the sending address... 
I don't know if that is safe to give out.. 
I would have to look it up? 
It's just gonna be unconfirmed forever, and never go back to my wallet... Lol... I'm that kind of guy with that kind of dumb luck lol
