Hmm. I feel like phrasing it this way as 'X per dollar' evokes the idea of things like microsoft points, rather than a currency that has an exchange rate with other currencies.
It's all semantics really

Not totally accurate, BTC does have an advantage for merchants compared to visa as they cop ~3-4% fees from credit card payments and only 1% fees from bitcoin payments through bitpay.

Thats per 60 seconds, read the side of the graph. 1000/60 = ~16.66 TPS

How fast is domain resolution? From what you have described it sounds like the perfect solution for piratebay. The only issue I can see is if it affects page load times.

There is an incentive to accept bitcoin payments even if it is only a small percentage of payments because it ends up being cheaper, compared to credit card fees.
So even if a lot of people aren't spending, as long as a few are then it is worth accepting BTC as payment. Of course the problem you described still stands if *no one* spends bitcoins, but even observing the market today you can see that isn't happening.

If there is a buy order for 100 dollars and a sell order for 80 dollars then there is a gap in the market. normally these would be matched and sold at 80 or 100 dollars depending on whether the buy or sell order was placed first. High frequency traders try to spot these mismatches and buy the 80 dollar ones first then sell them for 100 dollars to the other guy - both people leave happy. They don't normally do this at the level of 80 and 100 dollars though, more often very small amounts, because big mismatches like the 20$ one above don't happen very often.
