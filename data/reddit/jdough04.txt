Not sure, but some of the features on the site's homepage sound kind of unique and interesting: micro SD backup and not browser based, plausible deniability and multisig.

Thanks. After a bit of reading, seems that the on-chip HRNG is pretty good and would be sufficient. I guess the extra computer entropy is a safety mechanism in case the firmware gets hacked?

How secure is the HRNG in terms of being truly random?

What percent of customers end up getting a refund? Lets call this number 'R'.
What percent of money is saved by using BTC for payments? Lets call this number 'S'.
If R is less than S, I think I have a solution.
One assumption is that the most fair refund is a refund in the same currency used for the purchase, i.e. BTC.
Upon a sale, immediately convert all BTC to fiat except for the percentage 'S', and maintain this percentage in a pool of BTC. This pool will serve as the source for refunds, which if R&lt;S should never run out. In practice, it will fluctuate and so a capitol investment would be required to make an initial pool large enough to handle the variance.
As for company risk, on one hand if BTC goes to zero, the company would still make the same amount of money as before (minus the capitol investment) since the pool from S includes only extra money saved by using the BTC payment protocol. On the other hand, if BTC goes to the moon, you get a promotion.
Just guessing at numbers,  maybe S is the sum of a credit card swipe fee (3%?) plus money saved with reduced paperwork (PCI compliance - 2%? - no idea, maybe lower security and accounting work force needed in the long run). If S comes out to be 5%, then the above strategy would work if less than 1 in 20 people refund a purchase (1/20=5%).
In practice, different products would have different rates of being returned, and so this exercise may need to be done per product. Products with higher refund rates may need to be marked up a bit in price if feasible to increase S, or else banned from BTC payment. Products with lower refund rates could be marked down to add a competitive advantage over other companies.

Unless you end up in space, which is where the moon is btw
