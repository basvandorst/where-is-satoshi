I posted the below quote at $5200.  It still applies.  A guy told me I was wrong because he increased his BTC by 15% by day trading. He recc'd to buy the dip. he got way more upvotes.
Quote from 1 month ago:
I also love all the people were making fun of people for buying at 5200 within past 2 days ago. Those people probably just missed out on a 20% rally.  Nobody knows the short term that involves the actions of millions agents across hundreds of countries.  People trying to time are mainly non-experienced traders that will earn little 5% pick-ups until they get burned hard (works really well until it doesn't type of situation).
If you truly understand Bitcoin, you know the long term.  Buy-in periodically when you are MENTALLY PREPARED and ignore the 16 year olds who earned $200 bucks with a couple lucky play and think they are pro traders. 
Anyone can hit red three times in roulette, that doesn't mean its a good strategy.  The vig always has, is, and will eat every gambler alive, just as it will eventually get these types of inexperienced traders.  Brokers LOVE these guys.

And you most definitely do pay a vig when trading and trying to time the market.

All the people were making fun of people for buying at 5200 within past 2 days ago or saying "wait for the dip" now are so funny to me.  This could be the top, it might not be.

Haha, I still remember when people would periodically post the flag of him in California...
Back when Bitcoin was "one team one dream"... O well, at least we rich now.

Could you provide any evidence of your assertion?
Satoshi started it as an OPEN SOURCE project.  It doesn't really get more work in progress than that...
