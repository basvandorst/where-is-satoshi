Don't know what series you followed but in the graphic novels and animated series, Splinter was still a badass in his old age

Blockchain synchronization is going to be a nightmare with that amount of transactions being added daily

In MY PERSONAL OPINION, its going to crash because bitcoin is losing the actual 1 real value it has which is a currency. Steam has shown it's too unstable at the moment to be a valid currency and if fees just keep getting more ridiculous then it will be an unfeesable currency.
I've always agreed with the Bubble and 90s stock market crash comparison but said it wont be so bad or is a thick skinned bubble  because at bitcoins heart, it is a currency. It's not like a useless inflated stock that will become junk. It can and always will be used as a currency giving it value.
BUT now that its being inflated to this insane proportions and actually losing it's one real factor that its a valid currency it is changing into a inflated 2 pump dump stock.
Who knows maybe it turns into a 2 pump dump stock that just keeps endlessly fed but any minor thing that will cause people to stop buying like a another recession or too outrages fees will murder its value. I seeing that bitcoin will become the snake that eats itself.

286110 Unconfirmed transactions at current time of writing and it's getting worst by the second. I have a high fee transaction that has been unconfirmed for two days. In my opinion this is the main reason bitcoin is dropping. People can't move their coins around at normal pace anymore.
Whether this is co-ordinated DDOS attack is unconfirmed, but one thing is certain, this needs to be fixed asap or it will continue to cause bitcoin to drop (my opinion of course). Can possibly be the huge ATH price that caused a major influx in bitcoin "investing" from new comers. Either way, 4.5 transactions a second is not good, it's a major problem that needs to get addressed with hourly updates on a fix. But I look at it this way, if Visa or any other financial services pasted on high fees and had long waiting periods for transactions it would put a lot of people in trouble causing them to drop the service.
Just for the record because i see this happening a lot in this subreddit. I'm no bcash or bitcoin shill. I'm an inbetween that believes the in fighting between the two should stop for the good of the overall crypto community. Especially for the mass adoption. New people come on see this toxic behaviour on both sides and decide not to join any of the two communities.

But the damage is becoming like a phishing scam, some kid opened a "bitcoin" wallet with that chump's site. Then went to a bitcoin ATM to get some coins and send it to his wallet. The coins are officially lost because he was trying to send Bitcoin to Bitcoin Cash wallet.

Or could be someone who has been hodling for years that legit wants to sell. If I had those coins and seeing $17 250 000 minus fees then I would probably sell. I could retire from my job and live pretty well for the rest of my days with that type of cash. Basically cashing in a lottery ticket.
