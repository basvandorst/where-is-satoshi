Because BTC became the altcoin when it dropped witnesses from the block header via SegWit. Please reference the white paper title.

You'll choke on your own shit talk within three months...

True, will be hard to hide any significant amount of new money or assets though. 
Also local laws might not give half during a possible but hopefully not likely divorce.

Lol. Pulled out plenty from BTC over the years, put the rest in BCH because high fees are bad for businesses, like the ones you mentioned.

The title of the white paper is a very consise definition of what Bitcoin is by the genius who created it, I suggest you read it. The title mentions a chain of witnesses and how the coin is to be used as cash, not just a store of value. The blocksize limit and difficulty adjustment are not in the title. 
Transaction count for BCH is trending up and with time you'll see plenty of people using it.

What layer 2 scaling? Can it help avoid these crazy high fees right now?

Take a chunk and buy a duplex, triplex, or quadraplex rental property. Pay for a quality inspection before buying.
Pay a premium to get it at a good location in the nice part of town and be picky who you rent to and then you'll hopefully have tenants who pay on time and respect your property.
Then keep an eye on it and maintain it at most a few hours a month and you'll be your own central banker, printing inflation adjusted fiat every month for the rest or your life and have the option to sell whenever.
If you put the money into your bank account with no plan, you'll find ways to spend it and not have as much to show for it.

It's not an attack, but a result of Gresham's law

BCH code is mostly the original code based off the white paper, with the worst of Blockstream's crap removed. All those years in control and they couldn't  scale BTC? Lol, sit and watch BCH scale with ease and as Satoshi intended.
If you aren't going to be a part of it, at least you'll get to witness.

Yes, please push the large players even faster to BCH
@_date: 2017-11-25 00:04:02
I don't claim Bitcoin Cash is Bitcoin now, though if the market decides to in the future then I'm fine with that. 
People called me an idiot when I bought BTC in 2011, turns out they were the idiots.

Nice to meet you too friend! 
I currently have a rental house and about to add to our current house an in-law suite studio duplex, and hope to live the triplex dream one day!

At first glance I thought that was the BCH chart for the last 48 hours, lol
@_date: 2017-11-22 13:05:04
This.  I have serious doubts about Core's ability to scale any time soon, which is why I'm in the other camp.

I thought you would listen more if heard a surprising truth from the master micro blocker himself.
BCH market cap is now 5 times more than the copy and paste BTC testnet that is Litecoin. Only BTC and ETH are higher. ETH only scales a little higher than BTC as demonstrated by ICO day slowdowns, not to mention crazy plans to switch a heavily used coin from PoW to PoS.
BTC has crazy high fees for the foreseeable future and so now is more of a store of value because it's a store of value circular logic coin. Hence the easy choice of BCH as the best crypto currency choice, clearly confirmed by the market's reaction since segwit2x was cancelled. When coinbase, bitpay, etc add support, today will be but a minor blip.
