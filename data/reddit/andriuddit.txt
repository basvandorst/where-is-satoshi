 Low inflation is better than Deflation. With inflation your money losses value, with deflation actual goods lose value.
 Lets say,  you need to take out a mortgage, I borrow you 100k  USD and ask you to return it in 10 years adjusted to inflation. In those 10 years your house will likely increase in value, you sell your house and can return me the entire debt of $121 000 at current inflation rate.
 Now imagine we live in Bitcoin economy, I borrow you 10 Bitcoins to build a house, in 10 years the house value will decrease to lets say 8 bitcoins, but you will still have to return me 10 bitcoins that I gave you...
 Inflation stimulates the economy by giving incentive to people to invest into actual good and services, that's the point of economy - to produce things that makes lives better. 
 Deflationary currency would incentivise hoarding and slow down economy.

 Sorry, house value will remain the same - but Bitcoin value will grow ( Because supply of Bitcoins remains the same, while supply of everything else increases everyday.), thus reducing the price of the house in Bitcoins.
 The point of saving is to increase wealth, not to retain it. I want to work had to increase my wealth, to buy a bigger house, or a newer car.  I don't want to work hard just to be able to retain my small house or buy old car, that doesn't sound right.

 Banks protect me against fraudulent purchases, I can always get my money back 60 days after the purchase if something goes wrong.
 They also offer me free travel if I spend a lot.
 They take small fees and return part of it in form of cash back.
 I can also get the difference back if an item I purchased goes down in price.
 I can pay for each purchase in small installments if I don't have the money available at hand.
 I can always call the bank and human being will try to solve a problem if such arise.
 Do Bitcoins offer any of that?? How are banks shit?

 True Bankers are blamed for 08 crysis, along with government and irresponsible home buyers. But one of the main culprits that led to the crash is Deregulation of the banking sector that took place years before.
 Most Crypto fans support decentralization and  deregulation, but that's exactly what led to the 08 crysis.  Decentralization might be a good thing, but we need more regulation, not less.
 While printing too much money is a bad thing, there are direct opposite examples, when not enough money  supply causes or deepens the crysis, like the great depression of 1930's. We must be careful of what we wish for.

 It's a result of a an organized attack by bitcoin cash cartel. 
 
 2 days ago one  breakaway ex Bitcoin.com Dev ,that is heavily invested in Bitcoin Cash, announced that he sold all his Bitcoins and Bought Bitcoin cash instead - a lot of mainstream media reported that announcement - yet many of those media outlets completely miss reported the news, omitting the details and shortened it to something that sounds like "Bitcoin creator sells all his Bitcoins, says Bitcoin is doomed".
 
 Simultaneously Reddit Crypto boards got flooded by BCH shills bashing BTC and worshiping BCH. And the following day, in a suspiciously convenient time for all the shills Coinbase adds BCH, causing BTC to rapidly plummet and BCH to rapidly rise in a short period of time.
 The cartel probably intended to pump BCH at the expense of BTC, and it worked for them in the short term, but the side effect is that it caused a lot of people to pull out of crypto completely, causing damage to all the Cryptos.
 
That's my impression at least. People seriously need to stop messing around with BTC and understand that if Bitcoin goes down, everything goes down. We need to work towards stability, not manipulate volatile markets for personal gains, but try to convince someone when there are millions at stake...

 Yea, hedge funds too, but they at least had their part in building the price up earlier.
 
 And it's Christmas! Many people are pulling out for holidays.

 So total network hashrate right now is 30 000 000 TH/s
Most common miner is Antminer S9 with 13.5 TH/s
30 000 000 / 13.5 = 2.22 millions antminers
 To perform a 51% attack one, needs half of that - 1.11 million antminers, at $1000 each thats 1.11 Billion USD.
 So to perform a 51% attack on 128 Billion market, one needs just 1.11 billion USD. 
Doesn't sound very secure, or does it?

 If I understand correctly - They will replace current users authentic Bitcoins with the new so called "Bitcoins" without the users acknowledgment. So people having Bitcoins worth $4000 each today, might wake up with wallets filled with alt-coins of unknown (most likely much lower) value and not realize it, because the authors are promoting it as an upgrade and giving it same name as the authentic-bitcoin - thus misleading the users. If it's how it is - it's definitely a fraud.
 Correct me if I am wrong, that's just my newbie user impression of what is happening based on this subreddit.

Different purposes.
Monero strives for maximum privacy, Electroneum develops instant payments and seeks mass adoption.
Monero itself is a Bytecoin knock off if you like to exaggerate. Cryptonight is open source.
@_date: 2018-06-12 05:12:49
 &gt;Monero actually develops stuff, all electroneum did was make a fake mining app
 How is it fake? They never stated that it will perform actual mining. It rewards real money, who cares if mining is simulated. It's purpose is to introduce new people to crypto and serve as an easily accessible and usable wallet. It makes the job done as evident by rising number of users.
 


We have a global patent pending on a technology that allows instant cryptocurrency payments. Instant payments will initially be in ETN but our patent also covers Bitcoin.
The ability to SPEND ETN instantly is only half the equation. We have an API that allows easy integration to ACCEPT ETN instantly. This means it is simple to allow an ecommerce system to give instant check out, and even allows easy integration into ePOS systems (electronic point of sales systems or tills).
They are working on instant payments system right now, its a big thing, if they succeed.


 
AFAIK they didn't pay somebody else, that somebody else offered his help voluntarily and ETN team offered a compensation as sign of good will afterwards.
 Monero and ETN are not direct competitors, they both have their own niche, no need to hate each other.

If the phone was actually mining, it would drain phone energy and would never make it into the apple store. Faucet was a good decision and we will see the app in apple store soon.


 Just released at BCI summit.

 Amazing how it's allowed to exist for such a long time, by the authorities.

 Of course they scam, if Bitmain was a legit company they would offer legit payment options like Paypal and credit card.  For the buyer crypto is the worst payment method online  - zero buyer protection whatsoever.
