I heard the other day that this could create a situation where people like Amazon could have negative fees (as in you get paid to move money) through that route in order to rebalance that channel. As long as the onchain fees are more it makes sense that it could work like this. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:14:31
While this looks like great news, what are the odds that exchanges are going to just sit on it for years. We've had Segwit for months and most exchanges are still dragging their heels. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:09:44
Well transaction malleability needs to be fixed for lightning at least, are there any plans to fix that?
@_date: 2018-01-06 13:33:20
I literally use Intel ME every day to turn on computers both completely shut down and in hibernation states. It even allows you to collect system information from shutdown machines. 
ATX power supplies have a permanently powered on 5v line to power these services, it's easily probable too. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:00:41
Oh yeah, gold is such a shitcoin... 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:45:44
Bitshares is an obvious pyramid scheme?
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:16:48
There's nothing politically correct about it, call your altcoin what you like but don't be annoyed if other people aren't convinced. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:17:30
But it isn't bitcoin, just another altcoin and doesn't even have Segwit like LTC or VRT.
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:45:02
I disagree, if you want actual mass adoption you need something absolutely bulletproof and trustworthy or adoption will never be possible. Bitcoin has a much smaller attack surface and much more conservative development than everything else.
You can talk about sharding and tangles and shit but the more complex it is, the more likely it has a issue.
Bitcoin is comparatively simple and stable and that's what will bring the masses in and I all the LN demos I've seen look about as easy as using bitcoin now. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:50:38
If they control all of the outputs and are also collecting the mining rewards it is a lot less than 5 million.
In fact, miners 'spamming' the network also pushes the fee up for everyone else so the mining reward gets higher too.
Seeing how transaction volume dropped like a stone after Bcash and after (?) Segwit2x was dropped it's obvious that the volume is being driven up on purpose. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:25:44
How do you stop private key theft?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:53:24
Big accusation, no proof. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:21:06
Bitcoin has Segwit which is a huge advantage since it fixes transaction malleability which makes way for lightning and other 2nd layer solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:53:41
How about exchanges and wallets activating Segwit first, it's a solution available to everyone right now and it would greatly reduce fees and yet were still here. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:44:41
You will never get every single transaction written for eternity on the blockchain and also have close to zero fees. There is a near infinite demand for free storage.
Layer 2/3 solutions are the only workable solution to having 10s or 100s of millions of people using it. The base layer should of course be as decentralised as possible but it doesn't mean L2 solutions need to be centralised. I've not seen anything about lightning that would suggest it would be centralised, in fact it's cheaper to run than a full node and people may be able to reclaim some costs through LN fees. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:50:01
Can't you just restore your wallet using your seed? Won't cost you a penny. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:50:20
Yeah, that's not actually what political correctness means.
And in the standard usage of the word, it literally is an altcoin. That is a fact. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:18:56
Segwit not only doubles the effective blocksize it also carries a discount on segwit transactions. That's simply not true. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:42:16
I give it a year. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:14:29
Decentralisation should come before absolutely everything else. If you lose that all you have is a slow and expensive version of PayPal.
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:00:59
That don't mean jack shit as evidenced by the fact that BCH is down even more. 
Almost everyone here is using crypto to speculate on, one day sure I can see it being used properly as a currency but there's simply no realistic way we're going to keep every single transaction on chain.
If you care about using it as a currency, buy litecoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:29:35
Most online merchants for one thing?
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:27:30
You can withdraw bitcoin from Coinbase yes. You may also want to look at GDAX as there are no fees for trading. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 21:00:49
Multisig man.
@_date: 2017-02-21 08:28:45
Because if it was easy to generate new coins they'd be worth jack shit. 
@_date: 2017-02-12 19:56:57
Shadows copies were hit too apparently.
@_date: 2017-02-20 13:47:22
I've got no answer but how do they expect you to pay bills which require a reference?

TIL the global economy is infinite. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 18:12:05
They gave people enough warning and every opportunity.
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:27:52
Its worth noting that Electrum seeds aren't BIP39 complient, although most builds are able to recover BIP39 wallets. 
Not really sure why though. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:28:14
This is what I've been waiting for and I check the price and it hasn't even dropped under £3k. Disappointing. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 09:00:12
Why bother with some centralised, half baked pile of shit. We've got LTC which has been super stable for years. 
@_date: 2017-08-28 17:46:40
Are you sure? You can send millions of dollars worth of currency across the world for a few dollars that can't be intercepted by anyone and is confirmed in about 10 minutes. Bitcoin is working fine right now and the future looks bright. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:46:27
I do this but with a pack of cards. Sign the transaction offline so private keys never get exposed. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 21:32:11
Just try moving 25k out of the bank to someone elses address you don't usually, or taking 10k out of a bank. It's very possible you'll have your account frozen. 
@_date: 2016-12-23 07:58:48
I think he means fixing electricity prices. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:06:05
I'm pretty disappointed, literally no drop at all. 
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:18:06
I'd actually argue this is down to the community becoming larger. As communities get larger, they fragment as people find different aspects about something interesting. Some people care about the price, some about the technology and some about politics. That's okay.
@_date: 2016-11-08 07:59:30
Ha, I'll sign up for this!
@_date: 2018-06-16 22:53:39
In addition its against the opt in principle of Bitcoin. You choose what software to run. 
@_date: 2018-06-20 12:23:09
It's very possible this has already happened but nobody's been told about it. Coinbase would certainly try to keep it out of the news and just cover the losses on their own.  
@_date: 2018-06-04 06:22:41
Nothing wrong with VS Code. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:09:12
Make sure you're holding the private keys, that's a lot of money. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:46:08
Bitcoin visa cards aren't making on chain transactions just moving some 1s and 0s in a database. It's a centralised 2nd layer. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:51:01
I remember a few months ago that was ETH, how things change. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:08:12
Any increase in the blocksize will cause it not to be compatible with the current chain and will create a fork. There are plenty of other ways to allow more throughput than just increasing the blocksize limit. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:45:39
2x is a hard ford which means it's incompatible with the current chain. Meaning merchants, exchanges and wallets will have to be upgraded to use it. 
Segwit however is backwards compatible and doesn't break consensus. 
I don't think anyone is opposed to a hard fork if it happens long enough in advance, has the majority of users in agreement and while we're at it fix some of the underlying issues within the protocol that can only be addressed by a hard fork. [Like this.](
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:11:24
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:57:19
But if you go over to r/BTC you get people saying exactly that, people saying they want 2x to kill Bitcoin to bolster BCH. I find it weird frankly.
@_date: 2017-11-01 13:09:36
Or just a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-23 12:43:43
I'm starting to think round 2 of FUD and pump and dumps. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:37:55
When core 0.15.2 gets released I reckon. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:55:35
BCH doesn't use the EDA anymore. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:39:46
Of course it's an exchange. If you don't like how they operate don't leave your money on there. I'd rather an exchange take their time in their integrations with software that's of potentially dubious quality. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 09:22:38
This is probably what will end miner centralisation. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 07:59:20
@_date: 2018-03-04 22:52:30
Can't you just enable QOS on your router?
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:34:41
Yeah it will support quite a few blockchains. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 09:30:47
Market share has nothing to do with security though. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 21:46:30
LTC is absolutely a legitimate crypto, what are you talking. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 14:26:18
Emergency fork. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:43:42
And that's exactly why all of us are here. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:09:51
Weird project, might try and replicate it with a Ruckus AP I've got. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:11:46
No we wouldn't, we would have a subreddit full of people complaining the block size isn't 8MB. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:35:06
Because it's got the largest amount of merchants, users and exchanges by a long way. It's already accepted by thousands of shops in Japan for example, there might be a few places offering services in other currencies but the lion's share goes to BTC, which also brings the best developers to this space too. 
Many altcoins are good testbeds for different technologies but there aren't actually many that are looking to be 'stores of value'. Many like Etherium are looking to solve other problems instead. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 21:04:39
Decentralised exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:16:25
But you have to ask why they didn't want Segwit. It was a soft fork which essentially doubles the block size, fixes transaction malleability and opens the door to 2nd layer technologies. It was such a quick win but we spent a whole year in limbo why we argued over it. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:45:47
More than half the people on the planet can't get bank accounts because of restrictions outside their control. That's a lot of people who could be buying and selling products.
@_date: 2017-09-27 22:35:25
Definitely. 
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:54:18
But that's a totally comparable technology as it's decentralised and used to require a large amount of skill and knowledge to use and now is used everyday by everyone and nobody needs to understand what TCP IP is. 
Keeping and securing bitcoin is still confusing for many people but every year it gets a little easier and that'll onboard new users. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:56:13
To be honest I the reason I've got a Ruckus AP is because of the ridiculous radios in them and I'm not sure OpenWRT will be able to match it.
Found a way to do it via SSH though, I'll work it out tomorrow!
@_date: 2018-02-28 13:03:14
Linux isn't safe either if you're running it on a PC that's vulnerable to a host of CPU level side channel attacks and proprietary hardware built into the CPU with full network access. 
Hardware wallets or otherwise signing your transactions on an forever offline computer is the only secure way of transacting crypto. Even then you could have weaknesses in how private keys are generated or a whole other host of things that could steal your money. You are not safe. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 07:25:07
I slept and missed the dip, hopefully there's a bigger one. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 08:27:51
That's not exactly true or fair. The big lesson here is never to have your private key held on a device that has internet access.
@_date: 2017-10-03 18:47:29
There was something a few days ago about them having a large trade desk.
@_date: 2017-10-29 09:45:45
The only way that Bitcoin is ever going to properly scale to Visa levels and beyond is 2nd layer solutions like the Lighting network. If we're wanting mainstream adaption it's a mathematical uncertainty that we can keep every transaction on the blockchain (the most immutable database in the world) and keep the network as decentralised as it is.
I like the idea that it's like the internet in 1994, when there was serious concern that it would never be able to scale so that everyone could use it for email. And shit, now we can stream 4k video. 
If Bitcoin turns out to be a success, it will scale. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:18:04
It costs more than $1000 in energy costs alone to mine 1 bitcoin currently. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 06:07:24
Without decent radio drivers you're not going to get the same performance. Ruckus APs have radios in simply to listen to wireless traffic and adjust to it in real-time. You won't get that unless OpenWRT reverse engineer it for that specific device.
But yeah, it's a good idea. Nice way of spreading awareness.
@_date: 2017-10-12 20:33:49
@_date: 2017-10-15 19:40:52
Bitcoin core 0.15.1 probably, which will use segwit addresses by default. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:37:08
Sign transactions with an offline pc.
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:23:35
Won't that be a good day. 
@_date: 2017-10-15 15:34:47
It might be possible to reconstruct the database inside the wallet file. 
@_date: 2017-09-29 06:10:49
Who's paying you?
@_date: 2017-10-12 21:14:43
@_date: 2018-04-24 12:26:35
Peer 2 peer isn't a boolean, it's arguably more P2P since transactions are routed through a series of nodes on the network. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:34:22
It's all relative, it's highly divisible. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 17:34:43
Yeah no thanks. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 18:05:35
We've now got more debt than in 2008 held in subprime car and student loans. Asset prices at all time highs and interest rates at never before seen lows.
We failed to fix the issues 10 years ago and we've attempted to fix the issues by printing more money. It was just a throw away comment but central banks have been reckless and we will see the consequences of that. 
Surely were all in this sub because we believe in money outside government tampering right? 
@_date: 2017-07-07 22:49:55
Well I don't disagree with you, the risk is low but you're still talking about a device that's constantly connected to the internet (You have to trust your providers network), running closed source software (radio drivers, Google apps etc) and potentially a data goldmine. 
I personally don't have the risk tolerance to have apps on my phone have access to other apps data because it's got all my banking apps, Keypass and a host of other stuff.
I help secure some pretty big networks but I'd personally not like to make the mistake to say that these things can't happen to me!
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:25:57
If it's whole purpose is to stop DOS attacks how isn't it a security parameter?!
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:38:55
Haha you're kidding right?
@_date: 2017-07-12 06:19:18
Well it's good that Segwit allows you to have more transactions per block then. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 16:35:50
Oh Jesus mate that's pedantic. I think in the context of this conversation everyone was talking about the cap on the block size. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 19:49:08
If you're phone is rooted then you're opening up an avenue of attack, there was a few holes in Google Authenticator which meant on a rooted phone malware could recover authentication codes and render 2FA useless. 
Google Authenticator on a offline device would be the best call. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 22:32:45
In your opinion what would a 'proper hard fork' look like?
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:58:36
No it's just that they store most of their coins offline so when there is a large influx of withdrawals it takes a while. 
@_date: 2017-07-05 11:55:28
The chances are low but plenty of internet enabled printers have been hacked. Quite a few end up being part of botnets. 
@_date: 2017-07-30 07:02:03
But it's not to do with the bitcoin network, they're saying that they will take a long time to actually broadcast the transaction. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:09:03
That's very interesting, especially considering how many coins have been lost...

Definitely make sure you've got a backup, USB drives fail all the time. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:36:09

Coinbase works fine. I've also used Bittylicious for a few trades and it's very easy and works well when you've got a verified account. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 18:42:40
Let's hope so, get some cheap coins. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:33:23
A farm? But I suppose even that could be taken off you. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 11:31:08
But you'll still have 1 coin on each chain. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 07:30:45
You'll have 1 coin on each chain. 
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:48:02
This is compounded by the fact that if the price drops mining becomes less profitable and miners will be looking for a way out. Maybe it'll even switch miners to start signalling Segwit earlier. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 12:19:34
I'd say it's more likely they left to give their decentralised project more decentralisation. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:32:16
You should buy some dude. 
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:54:15
Depends on your expectations and timeframe really.
