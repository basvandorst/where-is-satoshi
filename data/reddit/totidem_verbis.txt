I completely agree. It's always the non-engineers making claims like this. There's always a risk of failure. Of all the cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is probably the least likely to fail at a technical level, but there's always a risk of systemic failure.

The transcripts are incredibly useful but it would be nice to complement with video recordings of the presentations. 
Have the edge dev++ presentations been video recorded?
Edit: Found the video recordings here:

Unless you provide arguments to backup your claim, your comment is based on bullshit. Ironic isn't it?
@_date: 2018-11-27 15:07:06
Grow up. You have an extremely simplistic view of how the world works.

Awesome, thanks for the explanation.

I would also appreciate if you could elaborate on this. I understand that SPV BIP37 is not ideal from a privacy and security perspective and that Neutrino improves on the concept using client side filtering. 
Question 1) How does the Electrum protocol fit into the picture? 
I've been wanting to connect an Android wallet to my full node and I've finally come across Electrum Personal Server (thanks for this BTW). But needing to use a separate "full node backend" seems a little clunky to me, and difficult to grasp, even for an advanced user like myself. From what I understand, BIP37 SPV uses the Bitcoin peer-to-peer messaging protocol. 
Question 2) Why don't most wallets simply allow for connecting to TCP/8333 on your full node and obtain merkle proofs of transaction inclusion via the P2P protocol? I feel like there's something I'm missing and you probably understand why. Thanks!

I understand, but what if you want to use a mobile wallet? You need some way to reflect the payments sent and received in your wallet. So you need to use some form of protocol to monitor the blockchain like SPV. The Electrum mobile wallet uses the Electrum protocol and Greenaddress, presumably uses BIP37. Why did you design the Electrum protocol? Why not simply use BIP37 and eliminate the need for a full node backend like Electrum Personal Server. I'm not critiquing, I'm just trying to figure out why it is the way it is.

They should fire you over this comment. You clearly lack technical understanding. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 03:40:03
Christ you're dumb.

Well to be fair, the sarcasm wasn't very obvious :)

Pfft. Here, you should check out some Bitcoin Edge tutorials to help you better understand the underlying technology: 
It's better than frothing about "bags" and "price". 
To answer your question about forks: it's relatively easy to counterfeit the greenback (USD). What if I conspired with a handful of people to market, distribute and claim that my counterfeit USD was the real USD? Let that scenario play out in your head.

What a stupid and ignorant thread. It's reminiscent of "I am 15 and this is profound" level discourse.
The Dow Jones is a benchmark index for blue chip U.S. equities, whereas Bitcoin is a digital bearer asset/commodity.

Do less talking and more reading. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 04:22:03
Man do I ever hope you lost money in the bear market. This red sea is a fucking cleansing. :D
Please, keep talking shit about Bitcoin to all the other idiots you know. Make them sell.
