You can invest with as little as $10. You don't have to buy a whole Bitcoin. But yes - do your research and determine how much upside there is and decide whether it is worth time time and risk to invest.

It just aired on the east coast. Not much to it. Basic info. Old Jamie Dimon quote and some generic financial advisor cautious warning. And a couple that turned 10k into 40k to pay for a wedding. Pretty weak.

I'm sad for your brother. Condolences to you and your family. I too have lost friends and family struggling with depression.

 seems to make it easy to buy through their wallet app and a credit card although you'll have to pay service fees if you already have a wallet address: 
- Bitcoin.com 2.5%
- Credit card processing by Simplex 5% ($10 minimum)

I've used their wallet for some time now and it's been very reliable for me. I tweeted to their support  and submitted a ticket. I'm sure they'll come back with a resolution.

I sent an email to Bitseed via Contact Us page and just received this reply/advice (Thank you, Bitseed!) 
"When Bitcoin core starts up, it rewinds and reverifies the last few days of blocks.  With a hard power loss it may do a more lengthy reverification.  This could take 30 min or more.  Core will not report status to the GUI during this time.  Check the GUI in an hour or so.
Worst case, if the database got corrupted by the power loss, it will have to reindex from block zero.  This can take several days to a week, however the GUI should report status (however it will run slowly) "

Bummer. Mine was working fine but I had a power outage and my Bitseed 3 was down for about a minute. I powered it back up but when I try to reach the admin screen, all I get is this message which I have never seen before: "The bitcoind server located at  on Port:[8332] appears to be unresponsive."

I just received a Ledger Blue Wallet. I like it but can take a while to receive your order. I like the Trezor wallets too :)
