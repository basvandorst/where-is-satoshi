It might help them to safely and reliably broadcast settlement data as they happen and reduce time to settlement from days to hours (minutes?). there's nothing wrong to run a private blockchain similar to an in-game currency shared between multiple parties that don't trust each other. banks do not need permissionless blockchain for this type of transactions. they are all licensed and established corporations that know each other and really don't need the public to read/write there. My 2 cents

@_date: 2015-12-09 11:19:09


back then all you needed to do was to install the bitcoin client, wait for it to sync the blockchain and check the mining checkbox somewhere in the preferences. only cpu mining without any need to set it up (unlike later gpu/fpga/asic mining gear). just run the only available client and wait. it was more letting the computer run 24/7 than doing anything else. for sure no exorbitant amount of effort (have you tried to turn the computer on?).  
also he was probably among the very first people who got to read the whitepaper, had the capacity to understand it's design and could have been familiar with its implications (first working e-cash) ...

Thanks, I'm familiar with the recent events (5 years).  
I was contemplating more the successful Greek bond auctions since the euro introduction. 2002-2007 when Greece accumulated the debt it could not longer service (spring/summer 2010 news that led to the first - 110 billion - bailout). I agree/remember a sovereign default seemed scary back then. But why were banks ~~borrowing~~ lending so much to them? why did they stretch their leverage so much? a haircut in 2010 would probably wipe out a bunch of them and have caused great stress. but that is the 2% risk surcharge they accepted for lending to Greece (in comparison to Germany, p.ex.)  
iirc the Maastricht stability criteria (most notably budget deficit limits and ratio debt/gdp) the country in topic did not met them a single time. my conclusion their public finances were in bad shape for a long time. I concede the discussion about Greece assets that could be liquidated (be it gold or natural resources). I'd like to find out more but have not sufficient info to discuss the topic.

I think he got your point but did not react. if a hopefully minor group of users decides to pirate content and sell it in their OB outlets it's their choice. If the buyer does not check out if seller is author and buys the offered content there's not much to do.

SEPA (EUR) transfers credited to account next business day, withdrawing also next business day. The trading interface quite OK, market data, orders, all usual bells and whistles to be found on the site. No bad surprises, the FAQ section is almost too much info but they cover lot of questions.  
And the fees are really nice. starting at 0.2 % and withdrawal Eur/SEPA 0.09 Eur. KYC/AML has several levels, w/o submitting scans of ID/utility bill you can deposit/withdraw up to 10k $us equivalent/month. with id proof submitted up to 50k/month and top tier is unlimited if you provide the whole dossier. support 2FA for almost everything (optional), like login, request new deposit address, withdraw order. 
did not try/enable API nor other currency pairs (they support far more than BTCEUR and BTCUSD).  
they also probably have some advanced options (legerage?) for trading, did not check that either.
All in all, would bang (again).

I came across the "accepted to pay all debts" explanation with an example of a shop and a restaurant. while I eat in a restaurant and going to pay the bill, I'm in debt to the restaurant owner (have already eaten) and he has to accept dollars to settle my debt. While the shop owner can refuse to give me the stuff I'm about to buy and refuse my payment if he does not seem my money acceptable. since he did not give me the goods I'm not in debt to him and can not force him to accept $. In a shop I could be asked to pay with bitcoin/gold/silver while in restaurant not so.  
Not sure what to do in the case of a fuel station when I got the fuel in my car and only a 100 $ bill to pay (if they do not want to accept them for whatever technical/procedural reasons).

from the attacker point of view it only makes sense to attack transactions that are your withdrawals and you can see those broadcasted because you know which address they should credit. transparency mainly improved public pressure and understanding of their bitcoin withdrawal problems. a minor effect could be convenient way for attackers to check what's there to target but if you can't claim those transactions being your withdrawals you can't gain financially if you mutate them.

how will they agree on exchange rate? where would they hedge for exchange rate risks? not so optimistic about this right now. if they have all their business denominated in us$ and pay each other via bank transfers, there is no credit card fee, no conversion fee. just payment terms (days after invoice, etc.)

there is an asterisk in empty 2014 coins to distinguish them from preloaded ones. 
if you visit him (in utah, in person) you can buy preloaded coin as it used to be the default for all pre-2014 coins. those have the same looks.
if you order per mail, you get an empty 2014 coin with an * next to the face value, to hint they were sold empty.

if I'd be a bank to lend you 3 bucks I need to just credit your account with 3$ that did not exist before. I'd put that in the books and you could use the newly created money. the moment client repays the debt this money is gone from the accounting. this is what I mean with destroying it. it is created when a loan (by a bank) is granted as bookkeeping entry. it is the source of said money, similar to new bitcoins in a new block. it was not there before, now it is in the books. when it is repaid it is gone.
every bank that grants loans creates new money.
for a not-a-bank to lend money, they have to have them first. when a bank loans money it 'prints' them on demand. they just do not produce bills and coins, they create account entries which are equal to physical money.

shady websites are good example. i would also avoid installing or even running software downloaded from the wild. not even "codec bundles" or "drivers" if the source is not the author's official download page / archive. could be as close as 2-3 hops from a search result just by following links from the landing page. authors exploit browser/os vulnerabilities so visiting a shady page is enough to get in trouble, no need to install anything

repurposing 1st gen asic miner to generate a visible bitcoin like income albeit in coinbase not valid on main chain. unless someone spends from main chain some old coins to an address controlled by the hipster. do not import your private keys if in doubt. 
also research. it's like having a pile of old newspapers which show from time to time a flash of news. it should be possible to broadcast transactions from main net to this system and see if they validate and will be included.
redneck whale spotting. as soon as a bitcoin whale moves funds (and does not mix them with recent coins) he will show up on the radar. the trade-off between blockchain height and required mining power to continue mining. it is scaled for two asic block eruptor sticks to find a block after few hours. if you redirect a bigger miner you should get block in matter of minutes.
like an ant kit ( but with bitcoin. think of it as testnet4 but the cool one. byzantine union test bed. to experiment with mining equilibrium and difficulty decrease. who knows what will develop. 
also a goal reached: redneck side chain implementation. at no cost. can run latest versions of major clients. still better idea then dogecoin. also finally solo mining ads to the fun.

Wow, I can't see any deviations from what should have been a smooth/flawless withdrawal except you're still waiting for the money. 
I must have misread the part with same amount/account, anyway limits have not been breached. 
Maybe one last thing, if wire is chosen by mistake instead of sepa, the money is transferred using the international route, which takes longer and has higher fees; the options are next to each other, could have happened. Otherwise there's something abnormal going on.

@_date: 2014-06-19 08:50:59
how's that? afaik there is no single node listening to morse. also it would be awfully slow. just sending a private key would be pita. encoding capital vs small letters extra info to transmit. sending whole tx would be even slower

in one of his earlier interviews he explained how he came to this value expectation: huge part of international trade would be paid with bitcoin. he counted from there, how much should a single bitcoin be worth to accommodate the volume of payments (share of global trade). unless bitcoin is used as tool for payment it's foolish to expect this part of value emerges. speculation alone will not do it. 
@_date: 2014-12-02 08:25:27
could you elaborate how to "you can use and check through blockchain.info" especially the "use" part? in the context of deterministic wallets one should not import private keys anywhere as the whole wallet would be at risk. from the imported key an attacker would be able to recover all other private keys. this is not acceptable
@_date: 2014-05-18 21:18:44
do you have any records that you can show the auditors? like watch only wallet, emails/invoices.  
you can track income in bitcoins, minus company spendings in bitcoins.  
assuming you provided addresses on the invoices, no need to examine that you own them now unless they are spent. no need to sign anything.  
I'd rather audit my payment process, accounting and document management than showing anything other than public master key.  
they can generate all my addresses and see for themselves

it could be also 2 of 5 (or 2 of 4), my attempt was to test the concept.

when price changes to a large degree people panic. either sell on the way down or buy in when exchange rate rises. during stable times (less volatility)  there is no such sell/buy frenzy and lower trade volume. so yes, less volatility means less trades. users are not motivated to change their positions.

that's why I used addresses that have public keys known by the blockchain instead of uploading private keys. it has the option to use private keys for unknown addresses but that was something i'm not comfortable with. despite the fact that multisig.info is hosted by Vitalik himsefl and he's in my eyes trustworthy enough not to log private keys but you're right, caution is advised. In defense of Vitalik and the multisig.info I suppose he did not finalized the configuration yet and https would follow. I just wanted to shout out loud that look over here, a working implementation!  
edit: i used private keys to sign so yes, at some point they were ~~sent in plaintext over the internet. good catch!~~ inserted in the browser
btw not sure how much easier it can get. It is a kind of payment to script and will not be less complicated by design.  
What i like very much is the option to run the tool locally or setup a server in the fashion of electrum network.

please focus on crypto, what is bitcoin (payment recorded in blockchain and a key to redeem it). private keys (secrets) - who knows them, controls the money. if unprotected, can and will be stolen. it is digital cash, people with poor digital hygiene will get robbed. 
please educate your readers about the potential to loose them quickly due to viruses, malware, hw failures etc.
also a peek view on it's history would not hurt. fun fact - the whole bitcoin network mining capacity after first year was less than 1 asic usb miner delivered in May 2013. network grew big and strong from cpu, then gpu &amp; fpga to asic allowing lot of people to join in the course of past years. as mining gear becomes obsolete some programmers copy ideas of bitcoin (and source code, it's open source) and clone cryptocurrencies in hopes to repeat the success of bitcoin. in 2011 they used to be called shitcoins and their only benefit was to drive away mining capacity from bitcoin network. people focus too much on mining and free money.

hmm, that makes sense. I was only thinking about 'selfish' attacker that has no interest in letting the exchange bleed on any/all random payouts. I was operating on the assumption that resend had to be manually triggered via a support ticket. I never did a proper black box analysis, just tried to figure out ways how they could be tricked into repeated withdrawal. that it could be automatic based on an automated check is something new. I thought that users would not complain when getting paid, despite not matching tx_id (honestly, who checks that when funds finally arrive?).

the issue with slow transaction times is that some business set up their payment processors to wait for confirmations of bitcoin transactions (wait until the payment is permanently stored in blockchain). you might ask the bitcoin payment processor of your choice to explain you the options and risks here. imho it should be fine to just wait for payment broadcast in the network (takes a second or less) and skip the waiting for confirmation part (minutes, or tens of minutes).

actually you can choose coins for sale but it requires a bit more work. to start with do not use a wallet to create receiving addresses but rather an external tool. keep track of your coins in a spreadsheet and import coins into a wallet when you're going to sell them. 
i'm doing it this way and know when i purchased, can sort by age, by source, balance per address ... i use vanity gen for key generation and bitcoin-qt client to import &amp; spend bitcoins when dealing with an exchange and electrum for private spending. a nice bonus - the qt client allows no fees transactions which works for older coins w/o issues. downside is the blockchain size (data on disk) and the 10-15 minutes it takes after key import to rescan the blockchain to find out new wallet balance. &lt;/rant&gt;

~~wow, that sucks.~~ can you use the rescan false flag when importing? like

to import a private key with an alias and disabling the rescan, getting back the prompt in the console immediately and continue importing?

in public procurement and bidding it's often restricted to email communication. you send your questions in writing and either receive an answer or the answer is published on their website, visible to all potential bidders. this way everyone gets the same info even if they did not ask the question. the awarding authority has to provide the answers to all interested parties.

I hope they will ask winners to provide the address in at least two channels (fax, letter, email) so that they can verify it before any coins will be sent. this way even if the email would be attacked and address changed, it would not match the address in the fax/letter and send would not happen. to avoid retyping addresses, electronic communication has its advantage. not sure the seller could handle encryption.

yes. it's bookkeeping money (mostly), created by the act of granting loan. when the load is repaid the money is gone, cease to exist. I assume you know there are more types of money (high powered money issued by central banks, physical currency units like coins and bills and well bookkeeping money created by commercial banks). so when a loan is repaid, there is no hoard of money left in the bank.

on gold maybe (there's a regulation for that, which forms of gold are not taxed), silver is taxed to death. and if you try to buy in switzerland or us/wherever abroad, you pay custom fees on import.  
lower tax on silver is if it is legal tender bu there still is tax which makes it less useful as store of value.

trezor is nice and everything, just the webwallet is not as reliable as it c/sould be and compiling a dev version of electrum 2.0 is not a piece of cake. the core client is also pita to use (segfaults, disk requirements). i'm afraid there's no simple answer. using web wallet that allows to backup private keys locally and when used requires 2fa is imo the most comfortable way. electrum w/o trezor is also good, assuming wallet is encrypted.

you're right, i was oversimplifying, i wanted to stress out that they're in delaying mode and any will blame anything to gain time and sympathy. 
i did further reading in the meantime, found out the tx maleability issue and also how different clients deal with leading zeros and fixes around that. liked this explanation: 
like you wrote, they could be able to identify successful transactions if they checked closer.
i can't guess if they lost any money due to this or how much they lost if people found out how to game the bug on their site. if indeed the bug was exploited, they have afaik identified their customers and can claim double withdrawals back as any other unlawful gains.

it's a cultural reference to mtgox and an user which is speculated to be a bot that bought coins in regular intervals, fake demand, driving price up. since it was "a leading exchange" the price move followed on all other exchanges.
handful of exchanges are/were open source (bitcoin-central, bitcoinica, albeit the later was more of an enhanced trading platform - legeraged trading) but it's probably not a one man job to write an exchange not to mention running one.

mtgox's fault was sloppy review of claimed failed withdrawals. and the drama in their pr statement trying to blame everyone and his dog. they were (seems so at last) indeed targeted by an attacker who produced modified transactions but since the inputs and outputs can not be changed, only re-arranged to cause real damage there had to be also errors on mtgox side which were their sole responsibility.

if you search the bitcointalk forum for sellers that accept paypal you will find a handful of them. downside: they ask high premium (10-20 %) over the exchange rate. to compensate for fraud and risk related to paypal payment method. what wrote pretty much sums up why buying btc with paypal is difficult and risky for the bitcoin seller. due to fraud almost everyone gave the idea up or those who continue accept paypal ended up asking much more.  
it used to be possible to buy linden dollars with paypal and exchange those for bitcoin, was not cheaper.  
not saying it's not possible, just that too many cheetahs made it too risky for everybody else.

it's from the code execution, rules that validate blocks and transactions. we agreed (bitcoin users) to block rewards for miners and have reward halving rule as well. they (bitcoins, all of them) are created by those rules and definitions. and blockchain is a counter we all agree with. 
bitcoins are mined in a predefined space and limited by definition. kinda like other fiat money. the mining work is just a lottery to assign who gets the right to publish a new block. the space where they come from was defined by software author.

 this thread has a promising title but little content (open source exchanges)  
if you have time to spare, have a look at open transactions  
if you could make a virtual machine with a running client, that would be awesome. high entry barrier to make it run. could be easy and help most to allow others to start to look at it. developing on top would be 'next'. 
edit: i mean it's less work then sifting through large projects like the bitcoin-qt or any other wallet for that reason. in general i think clients are already fine; i see need for tools for contracts, easy signing/verification of them, creating digital assets either by self issuing or backed by bitcoin or denominated in bitcoin.  
my last thought for the moment, there is a hardware wallet (trezor) that could receive some attention and support. p.ex. localhost frontend, to get rid of mytrezor.com dependency. electrum 2.0 wallet is not yet released, it has already support for it but the folks from electrum refuse to release beta version binaries so it is not available to the masses.

I was being ";)" and nobody in the discussion mentioned it before. Let's be at least a byte more honest when pitching bitcoin to entrepreneurs. It's not only instant, irreversible, digital, censorship resistant, hyperinflation resistant, anti fragile magic internet money. It has some inherent risks and _nobody_ else was pointing them out. I imagine the bus driving business is tough in Germany and in the scenario of bitcoin getting an interesting share of revenues the exchange rate risk should have been advertised up front. I doubt that a company would keep cash in the form of bitcoins if they have bills to pay but if they contemplate that, the pro/contra analysis should be attached. Right now we have the 2011 2nd half of the year replay (kind of). And nobody points out that this technology is quasi perfect payment system but much less suitable store of value?

actually why not? they (ring of banks interested in inter bank transfers) can put a fixed amount of tokens in the genesis block similar to bails they deposit with the current clearing center and issue blocks every now and then, as needed to broadcast transfers. no need to have incentives from mining as the money comes from credit issuance and not from some p2p ledger entry. they could all mine with a block eruptor stick and be fine since they do not have to proof work or compete for rewards. the motivation here is to have a more frequent clearing and a transparent accounting withing a defined and known group of users. more like a byzantine trade union where they make sure they don't work themselves to death by mining when all they need is a cryptographically safe way of announcing account transfers.

iirc before sepa time limit for bank transfers it was popular choice of a bank to 'delay' the transfers to park the money on overnight inter-bank lending deals to get some free money just because they could get away with it. sender's bank would debit client's account immediately and only forward it next day, after getting 1 overnight deposit interest. receiving bank would credit client's account also only after parking the money overnight to get some profit. today they clear transfers once in the morning and then once in the afternoon so that after they run account updates money can be received next day. so the argument that banks delay the money to gain some temporary liquidity may hold to a degree

Hi, I assume you are at least tier 3 verified (daily withdrawal limit &gt; 2000 $us equivalent) and your cumulative requests for that day were within your daily limit (sum of fiat &amp; btc withdrawal requests). You mention "same amount withdrawal" but did not exclude limit overdraw by including other cryptos.
As for the waiting :( no idea where the delay comes from. They use Fidor bank which is bitcoin friendly. I got all my deposits / withdrawals next day, except the week of gox shutdown, they came on second working day, all within the sepa limits.

or electrum wallet, import that key, restart electrum to fetch balance available from the imported key &amp; send the balance to one of the electrum deterministic addresses. that way it would move to the electrum wallet and could be restored from the seed ...
or multibit, it's as well lightweight wallet, but backup is more bulky in this case :)

I am referring to the so called recall.  
  
A Recall occurs when the Originator Bank requests to cancel a SEPA Credit Transfer. The Recall procedure must be initiated by the Originator Bank within 10 Bank ing Business Days after execution date of the SCT subject to the Recall.  
A bank may initiate a Recall procedure for following reasons only:  
 - Fraudulent originated Credit Transfer 
and two other reasons  
not talking direct debit here. just pointing out that even credit transactions can be reverted. true that it can not be initiated by the user/client, must be a bank asking for it but they are doable and they have 10 days to revert fraud transfers.

no. address is a hash of a public key. the pubkey is being broadcast at the time of spending. you have a private key, public key and an address where the address and pubkey are two different things.   
edit: address is a hash of a public key with a prefix and postfix. prefix distinguishes main network from testnet and other alts (like namecoin) and the postfix is a checksum. this is true for a simple bitcoin address starting with 1, no idea how addresses for p2sh (starting with 3) are composed

I used to watch the offers quite frequently some time ago and can confirm that those close to market value are filled 'fast'. depending if you want to buy or sell, just post your bid/ask and someone will fill it.  
sometimes I got the impression that my (close to market value) offers were accepted by the makers with big spread to keep theirs available on the market as the best ones. they were accepted at the lower (lowest) posted amount I had to re-post them.  
maybe a feature request - auto re-post offer if it was filled partially and the remaining coins are more than X? might be fairly easy, keep the min value &amp; rate. wonder if it's on the roadmap already or i'm missing  something why it would not work

some buyers wait days (btc/eur). also keep in mind that bisq needs to run on a pc connected to the network so it might be someone at work running the node at home and will only with delay find out that an offer was accepted. using bisq means brace yourself for trades draggin on for over several days til they are done. which is unfortunate when market moves fast.

you can structure a bitcoin payment to include moderators/arbitrators. such transaction has two steps. 1st bitcoin is commited to an address (script) like in a payment. 2nd it is released for spending by either the receiving party or returned to the spending party. this is what the moderator can influence.  
it's not widely used but it's doable.

that's what the display on trezor is for, verify transaction before signing. you see where the funds will be send.  
you're right thinking that malware would replace the address in clipboard and replace it but the hardware wallet would show the final destination and ask to confirm.  
  
e: for those who don't understand how hardware wallets work, they hold the private keys and sign all spending transactions so even if the malware replaces the recipient address on the host pc the hardware wallet shows what transaction looks like that is going to be signed and shows whatever the malware injected into the send request. trezor does not care, it shows the tx and waits for confirmation; it's up to the user to verify and reject if the send to address does not match

that's how I understand Coinbase's involvement in the consortium or what's the governing body of Libra. also not sure if you had chance to read that it will be a kind of stable coin, backed by a basket of currencies (bank deposits and government securities). small fluctuations will happen as the currencies in the basket would change value relative to each other but it will not be demand/supply driven. just a (massive?) pool of money available for their userbase to spend on whatever. and I speculate since coinbase is in the team they will find a way how to make it available for crypto on their platform.

elsewhere you wrote a nice summary why when an attack might make sense if a currency has the same POW but only minimal hashing power backing it (compared to a competing coin).  spent some thoughts on the 51% attack, what conditions would make it feasible, etc. In my opinion there are a lot of ignorant users who did not bother understanding how bitcoin works and see only the exchange rate and how it moves.

careful with the fungibility there. one can not simply recast bitcoin into new form. it is only valid if one can prove it's complete history from coinbase tx to unspent output. some of the transactions have outside of blockchain labels as stolen, been used in dark net markets, bought in us marshal auction or vanilla which work against the "identical to the others and equal in worth" argument.

Mempool drops old transactions if they are not included in a block. it used to be 48 hours minimum. it's not about what your wallet allows you with spent outputs, it's what nodes do with valid txs that were broadcasted and wait to be included in a block. they 'expire' without making it into blockchain

how often do you face credit card fraud? how fast do you access the money if paid with cc (is this the 1-2 days you mention?). my tip would be to manually buy bitcoin with funds you have left at the end of the day.  
so I've heard it takes 6 weeks (or months?) before the funds become safe from dispute. between payment with a credit card and the money being truly yours the credit card payment processor can always claw back the funds and here lies the risk that someone must bear.  
@_date: 2015-07-19 09:49:33

with a grain of salt two options:  
1. run a full node: install bitcoin client, wait anything from a day up to week for it to synchronize the blockchain (~~150~~ 212 GB of data) and it opens the wallet for you and will scan for any spendable amount ...    
2. upload your wallet somewhere, to a service that would parse it for keys and import them, credit your bitcoin balance (there used to be online wallet providers capable of importing wallet.dat files)   
I would not recommend giving out the wallet file to anyone. keys are a kind of secret. who knows them can spend the coins and you need to trust them, which is kind of taboo around here  
e: I see you already have bitcoin core installed. you probably do not have enough disk space to download the whole blockchain. if you would try to fully sync your node, I recommed upgrade bitcoin core, it synchronizes faster in the latest version

a technical note on the dip of gold price at the start of interesting times: gold is perceived as being highly liquid and people who own it (or sell it) have also other assets, maybe in leveraged positions and as they need to come up with fast cash to cover their positions they sell gold first as it's available to them at no extra costs (compared to additional credit). so there is a spike in sell pressure and a dip in price.

I fail to see the same receiving addresses when I switch between clients (the same trezor wallet shows different addresses if used with electrum vs mytrezor.com). Is there any trick/feature that make sure same addresses are used by both (all) clients? kind of initiation vector parameter?  
I see some explanations from about multiple files, will see if that answers my question (get same addresses to see/use from electrum and mytrezor website)
@_date: 2015-11-26 06:51:47
I wish, but no. it's not my project and I have no interested in it or income from it nor did I use it to "sell" any content. I just checked incoming txs on the address shown in the posted link. it suggests that there were 2+ btc received but that address shows far less. I think it's a demo gimmick (unless the addresses rotate somehow and the payments are linked together off the blockchain, which I doubt). anyway, I replied in the context of nsfw tag, nothing more.

the seal is only on 1 side of the box ;)  
anyway you can always reset/wipe the trezor if you buy one 'second hand' to create a new wallet inside (new 24 words seed)  
and probably upgrade firmware, since it does not ship with the latest one. this will check if the boot loader is ok  
all in all buying trezors from any semi-reputable source is not an issue imo. gl finding someone to share the purchase (or better, keep them both and give one as a present)

yes, I know and expect that. what I do not expect is to get for one password same addresses derived in mytrezor/electrum and using different password leads to different addresses in mytrezor/electrum. In my test case different passwords produce different behavior. once the addresses match, other time they do not. can you see the "subtle" difference here?

as for entering trezor's seed in electrum: no. just plug in the hw wallet and enter the passphrase. I thought electrum would be 'just' functioning as gui/frontend to keys on trezor.    
I'll give it a try tomorrow without the passphrase to see if those addresses are also different.  
the gap limit should not be an issue as the addresses should be used from the beginning of the address space. 
@_date: 2017-05-11 10:36:30
it might be the information asymmetry kicking in. still a lot more people don't know about bitcoin compared to those in the know resp. bitcoin owners. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 14:44:50
so the same seed (in trezor) without password shows the same addresses in electrum and mytrezor website. the difference is there only if used with password.  
and another password (without special characters) with the same seed shows correct account  in both apps albeit electrum shows only the first account and not other accounts.  
to complete, electrum supports multiple accounts without password. with password I see issues.

maybe try out small purchases from time to time? get familiar with the purchase process, get confident using the software (wallet, password management, backups). get verified with an exchange in advance. you could start with a purchase with pocket money or the value of a meal once you skip dining out ... you can still wait for a plateau but could be already sitting on some fraction of bitcoin while you wait

you overthink that. gold can always be reduced to it's scrap/melt value and it does not care if it previously was a rare coin, piece of jewelry or a nugget from a museum display. it gets melted, re-purposed and one is like the other. bitcoin is only valid if all its history from mining to current unspend output is valid. once involved in crime it might be tainted and no way around it.

no need to reset trezor. as u/bitcoinisliberty writes, in electrum create a new wallet and in the dialog screen choose hadrware wallet/trezor.
the electrum file on your pc will then contain master public keys and some transaction data but the private keys will remain in trezor.

argument valid for bitcoin as well. when it's profitable, new mining equipment is added and the production rises. the theoretical 14 days last only 9-12 days (see historical data). difficulty adjustment would fix it but the network grows so fast (and continues to grow) that most of the 14 day periods lasted only 12 days so one can argue that amounts of bitcoins pulled out of the defined total supply is bigger than what it should be

I used both and currently prefer electrum. I accidentally a private key from multibit on mtgox and was not aware that that was the 'change address' key so every time I used multibit it sent the change coins from each transaction to that very same change address that was promptly swept by mtgox (since I imported that key on that site). I blame my ignorance but the unpleasant part is that it happened in the April rush and I had to verify my account with mtgox and they had frozen my bitcoins in the meantime. I could not transfer them for several weeks (I did not wanted to send them there in the first place, it was a byproduct of an imported private key from multibit and multibit sending bitcoins there). anyway I was already on the way to leave multibit for something else when I started importing keys to other services/wallets so this just accelerated my effort.
on the other hand, multibit is a decent wallet, should fit most noobs &amp; supports more languages (translations). minor minus point: multibit cannot send to many (addresses in one transaction).

Actually I did not like this part of bitcoin. Then I got used to it.
I did following experiment (warning research in accounting using virtual p2p currencies)
- put 10 dollars (equivalent in eur) into a piggy bank and marked it's value in bitcoin in my personal accounting system
- track the value of the 10 $ balance in savings using bitcoin on a weekly basis
here's the disturbing observation: despite the fact that I did not touch this savings account (especially no withdarawals), the reported value was constantly changing and mostly falling.

I suggest also (when giving paper wallets away) to include "best before --arbitrary-date--" and remind them you have backups and could use them after that date if they still would be in dat wallet.
I found only one colleague willing to talk about bitcoins, helped him to buy some and now I don't talk about it to new people (at least not initiate talks, not introducing this topic, etc.).

more like ponzi 2.0 (you need more new money entering than leaving). but with the information asymetry there are imo still more people that do not know about bitcoin than those who are already familiar with it. and imo even people who know about it do not hold any but plan to buy in somehow, so there could be new buyers lurking or looking into this. I know 'ponzi' is taboo here since bitcoin does not qualify as such in the strict sense but as the value comes from new money entering the system, it has some similarity

@_date: 2013-12-10 16:40:37
i think i see your point now. i was thinking more along the nature of money, how bank makes (most) profit charging interest from loans given (from money they create). in my opinion a cut from transactions (fees, services) will not save the day if they can not create bitcoin certificates. what they could do is charge single(?) digit % fees from transfers from/to exchanges for the extra risk. but i see no way how they could profit from bitcoin transactions unless they become miners themself or enter use bitcoin for interbank clearing/transfers and add a layer around it converting legal tender from/to bitcoins before/after transfer. i'm in eu and euro clears twice a day with guaranteed 48hrs to transfer between any two euro banks. i wish they would enter bitcoin markets and stabilize the exchange rates with their vagilions of dollars/euros/pounds but that might not come (and is explicitly outlawed in china atm - separation of banking and bitcoin systems).

if you have a semi IT skilled salesforce, btcpos.com allows to use any smartphone/tablet as pos (generate QR code with address &amp; sum to pay) and verify if payment was broadcasted in the network. the solution uses a master public key that can only generate addresses so that the staff can not steal from the shop owner (BIP0032 deterministic wallet for tech. details). pretty easy albeit also only basic features. but it might be the easiest way to start accepting bitcoins. afaik bitpay does som seller verifications (which I do not object, just may slow down adoption).

you need to be more specific about the time you're interested. the banner on faucet was "I've heared you give away 5 bitcoins, now it's 0.5 (later 0.05)" explaining why he lowered the payout. For testing and education purposes the 0.05 did a good job anyway. I hope some old dogs will thow in their memories. It might have been 5 bitcoins in early 2010, half a coin late 2010 and 0.05 in 2011 when I noticed. I see someone posted a link to archive.org that might answer the question in more detail.

related to why gox account might be labeled 'phishing related' - assuming they receive money from hacked bank accounts that needed to be reversed, it's logical that banks get cautions when client asks to send money there. prevention is cheaper then the reversion of such transaction. afaik SEPA transfers can be disputed up to 10 days after the transfer where the receiving bank has little options to refuse such request (if money comes from a compromised account). 
that might explain why payouts from mtgox take 20+ days, allowing to wait and see if the funds that arrived on the exchange also stayed at the exchange. 
if my bank would call me in such case, kudos to them for doing their job. I would only see a problem if they would refuse the transfer after I expressed my wish to do it despite their warning.

precisely what you need is btcpos.com - website that generates QR codes from a public master key. you/owner creates a deterministic wallet, p.ex. using electrum client, export the master public key, setup an account with btcpos.com and all you need next is customer who wants to pay with bitcoin. employees have no access to the private keys and can not cheat you. however they can easily create codes with address/amount due and check if payment was broadcasted.  
converting to legacy currency is your responsibility, btcpos does only address generation.  
works in any smartphone/tablet, it's a website

I disagree. Banks' profit comes from creating new money by giving loans. They need few dollars in reserves/deposits (single digits) to loan 100. Rinse &amp; repeat and you have banks earning interest from money they just created (did not have in the first place). 
How can they recreate that income with bitcoin (charging interest from money that did not exist before you took the loan)? Would you as bitcoin positive business accept a payment in the form of bitcoin certificate issued by a bank? Would you deposit any bitcoins into an account with a bank if that bank would have the right to pay you back in legal tender instead of bitcoin? hint legal tender must be accepted as payment for debts &amp;&amp; when you deposit any money with the bank, bank owes you and legal tender will settle the claim (at latest in a court room).
Banks will not hug bitcoin users.

the payout was lowered from 5 to 0.5 to 0.05 to 0.04 (with 0.01 fee) and so on. Probably also 0.005 not sure. When I first found it it was 0.05 with a note that it was lowered recently and might go up to 0.5 if donations to the faucet would exceed X. But at that point the number of visitors kept the faucet balance pretty low and decreasing. It was few $ cents back then and it was a good starting point to test the technology (create a wallet, find out how to copy your address from wallet to faucet, see incomming transaction, send it somewhere else. etc.). To combat abuse (scripting) Gavin added IP restrictions and once the faucet was compromised by an admin of the hosting service he shut it down. 
tl;dr; your memories could be true with 5 as well as 0.05. they are both true.

- bitcoins have predictable supply and no way around it (no central authority to change rules and add above agreed limit)  
- transactions are irreversible (get paid, stay paid; once you accept them as payment they are yours and can not be disputed)  
- work well over tcp/ip ;)  
- it is programmable money, can do whole bunch of new things that legacy money can not (smart contracts p.ex.)

the lamassu ATM has a scanner in the bottom-right area (QR codes, pics of cute kittens, ...) and a slip for paper bills in lower-left area. the big display leads you through the purchase and shows tx id of the payout at the end. total 3 steps.  
i had to call a friend for advice how to use it, did not find the scanner and hoovered with my phone in front of the display. the whole time i thought the lower-right thing is for dropping print outs of some kind. luckily i learn fast ;)

Thank you. The idea for that experiment came from bitcoin wallets trying to show me the $ value of the balance. Since I could not see the merit of that feature (but had to translate the labes as I'm localizing some of the clients) I wanted to see how it would work the other way (valuating a $ balance in bitcoins). And since I track some figures about my financial situation (pm holdings, account balances) I was curious how that would work expressed in bitcoin. In similar fashion I convert the value of precious metals also when calculating my total balance.

IMO you're lowballing the problem that it's only a web wallet. once blockchain.info goes missing in action or gets compromised, there goes your balance. you're not the only master of your keys. this is what matters to some users. 
otherwise the app is good, use it myself and recommend it when asked for an iOs app (sadly I don't know any better alternatives)
@_date: 2013-11-21 14:12:21
maybe you need to day-trade (bitcoin.de can't do easily), maybe that market is too cumbersome by desing (each trade has to be settled directly via a bank transfer, each partial fill requires a bank transfer). are you a sophisticated user with needs not covered by bitcoin.de? I used them both and see more differences than mentioned in the post. just curious.

not being a bank is mostly a proper licensing issue. i'm new to financial regulations but sofar I see two different levels of licences to create money.

2. electronic money issuer (can create max 5 mio Eur)
exchanges do not create money, only hold deposits and update balances. just my 2 cents

q: do you see any potential for numismatics in bitcoin? all bitcoins being equal there might be some more memorable (p.ex. coins used in the first transaction ever, coins from the 10.000 btc pizza, coins from the first block mined) or desirable. if physical coins are collected, why not collecting virtual currency species? and not talking here about physical tokens with keys glued on them. crypto-numismatics

it happened in p2pool 'a few times'. the dishonest miner was mining in the p2pool and got paid for her contribution to the pool but when she found a block it was broadcasted as a solo miner, keeping whole block reward. the proof of it is in the blockchain, she used the same address for p2pool partial reward as well as the whole block reward. after the question was asked how was that possible this phenomenon stopped.
edit: peer to peer pool works different from other pools, thus the miner can cheat if she wishes to do so and know how to patch the sw.

I recall reading somewhere that you can redeem shares for bitcoins. Shares would be destroyed and you could walk away with bitcoins redeemed. Shares represent claims or ownership of bitcoins held by the etf.
I'm just curious if they will publish addresses of the coins held by the etf for more (total?) transparency.
@_date: 2013-12-21 10:07:33
it's maybe not worth to stop bittorent. plus there are multiple torrent networks while bitcoin is sharing a single ledger in _one_ network. to keep bitcoin running you need to connect all nodes wishing to broadcast spending transactions and also connect all miners who maintain blockchain.  
shutting it maybe very hard, disturbing it to the point where easy use is not possible is fairly doable (imo)

under some personal data protection regulations the exchange could share such data only with law enforcement and not the general public. so where's the problem?
same applies to all merchants that sent me stuff for bitcoins. they all know what delivery address I used and again, it's between us (and the bureaucracy if they bother to ask).
I pay my taxes from capital gains (where applicable) and use new addresses for each incomming bitcoin. selecting payment addresses carefully to avoid multiple inputs when paying for stuff. there's only so much you can analyze.

I'm eager to learn the best account practices available. Altering the ruble/usd example: I have two companies, one in US and the other in Russia where the US company owns the other one. Once in a while I want a single figure, in $US, that reports the value of both companies (let the business in Russia be a simple one, like holding cash in account). So the volatility of Rubel will impede the company value. That was my point.
Or my expectation is simply wrong and there never will be 'that single number' if the two companies work with different currencies? 
In the books should I keep those savings valued at the first exchange rate and not touch that?

... but looking at two things at once (dusty piggy bank with 10$) the savings account expressed in btc I could only see that I have less and less money. The excercise was about accounting in bitcoin and it was as simple as do nothing, just observe. It was pretty dynamic for a doing-nothing accounting system. I did not care about the economy, just focusing on a single aspect of bitcoin, as accounting unit ;)
