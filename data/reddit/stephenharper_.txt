Right?! Bought at it's lowest, i'm so happy about it's performance. I predict 3$ by the end of the year.

I have no idea. You have to read about the currency, the people behind it, you have to see if it's a project you want to be a part of. If you see a future for BCH, sure. Keep in mind you should always invest in projects you believe in.

Better buy now because we might hit that 17k wall and be on the way up for a while.

I have a preference for LTC but ETH is certainly gonna keep growing too.

It went from 17k on december 7h to 13k on december 9th. That's a 25% drop. There was your correction. If I had to bet, I'd say it's going to go on an uptrend now and you missed a pretty big dip. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:41:12
Buy the dip y'all 
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:46:48
Yup. Just bought some. That sneaky little fucker will ride up to 350-400 again.

Nop.

Nah man. Look at the charts. The past 3 days have been a huge correction. There is no way in hell you are going to see a 50% drop in BTC after the media coverage it has gotten in the last week. Everyone is looking to get in. If anything, you'll see another good correction towards the end of December, but certainly not 50%. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:05:11
That's what I think. If you look at the one month chart, that growth is exponential and unsustainable, just like BTC's growth when it went from 10k to nearly 20k in a couple days. It's bound to drop soon.

I feel you. I almost bought at 93 but I was too cheap, I wanted it to go to 90. Missed the boat on that one. FeelsBadMan

An attempt to create a currency similar to bitcoin but with lower fees and faster transactions. It was used for a pretty big pump and dump a couple weeks ago and it's been stabilizing since then.

Buying those &gt;100k cars is ridiculous. Save a little more and buy some property.

Nop. That's just called playing it safe. The worst thing that could happen is that it hits your sell order and goes right up again and you would just have to buy it higher than what you originally bought for.

I would recommend diversifying your portfolio but wait before investing in LTC, it is at an all time high. As BTC price goes up, LTC will start going down. That’s when you should to invest. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 00:28:35
I would recommande buying now since I think it is (very) slowly climbing up but it'll eventually hit 17k and 18k and next thing you know it'll be 20k.
