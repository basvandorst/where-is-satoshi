Nothing at stake and costless simulation or two slightly different concepts.  Lets take the nothing at stake idea.  This is where people ignore the consensus rules and forge on all available chains for the highest possible chance that that their forged blocks end up in the longest chain.  However, forging on all chains is not 0 cost.  It does require some bandwidth and some CPU to verify all the transactions.  So, it's not really 0 cost.   As long not more 50% of the forging power is not actively forging on multiple chains the network will still reach consensus.
Costless simulation also still requires control of significant stake or actively blocking broadcasts of other chains.  Nothing prevents you from going back and simulating the bitcoin chain from the last point where difficulty was still 1.  It is only apparent it is a false chain if the real chain were to also to be available to the client.  So a MITM on both NXT and bitcoin could create a false chain to a brand new client trying to download it.  
Neither NXT or DPOS use centralized checkpoints so your example of peercoin using it isn't representative of the entire space.
The NXT thread basically states on the last post that longest chain is the one with the highest cumulative difficulty, which again the 50% of available forging power will determine that.  
All that being said is that PoW definitely has a longer history and a lot more people looking at it from a security point of view.  DPOS, does add a lot of complexity so I do worry about new issue being found out about it, but ultimately i think any issues with PoS can be worked around to come up with a much better economical consensus method.  Only time will tell though.

If you actually try out NXT you will see that the term is valid.  I would say that counterparty barley qualifies as 2.0.  I think NXT, Bitshares, Ethereum are the real 2.0 player.  
2.0 in my mind is an all new blockchain designed to support advanced features.  I like counterparty but in the long run will be hamstrung by being on top of Bitcoin.

In the the longer term, global transaction processing can scale via alt coins.  Meaning we may not be able to handle all the global transactions with just Bitcoin.  We may need a couple alts to handle all the world wide demand.

"A private key on its own is useless, and not evidence unless somebody tries to unlock every wallet in the world with it, and gets lucky."
Really?  Give me one of your private keys and see how long it takes me to grab the coins...  You can derive the public address from the private key.
Sorry, you seem to lose credibility after that line.

Seems like the title companies will make this easy/safe in the future.  (My house is already sold :)  .  Whether the buyer or seller wants BTC to be a part of the transaction the title company can do any conversion (if necessary).  So, actually buyer and seller could pay/receive in any combination of fiat/BTC.

Maybe not peercoin itself but the proof of stake concept is very much a threat to proof of work.  I think NXT and Bitshares which are both built on proof of stake are real competitors.  
@_date: 2014-05-10 16:03:23
Forget the whole big b little b distinction.  Only programmers could possibly think there would be a difference between the two.  Bitcoin, bitcoin, btc, bits, all mean bitcoin the currency,   Blockchain should be used for the name of the protocol.   Try using the big b vs little b when talking with someone in person.... Major fail.

Bitshares, NXT , and counterparty all provide Bitcoin trading capabilities on blockchain.   Decentralized exchanges, none of them require aml or kyc.   You do have to get some of the underlying asset though, BTS, NXT, or xcp.   If you get some Bitcoin on local bitcoins then possibly find someone to trade on the respective forums.

A key difference between bitusd and nubits is that for bitusd the reserve is held securely by the blockchain itself vs nubits where you have elected custodians holding the reserve.  As far as I can tell there is 0 oversight of these custodians ( besides what they tell us) , their security practices or whether they are properly hedging so they can maintain their reserves.
@_date: 2015-01-18 18:45:34
Okay, that's good to know, in that case, I guess the title was a little off but was not done as some sort of concerted marketing effort from bitshares.  In my research of nubits i ran across this and thought it was pretty surprising so I posted it.
... although not sure why a large reserve account would be necessary if you can just vote more into existence, maybe because how quickly you need them?
With any large custodian account the major concern is on the USD reserve side that large Nubit custodians are theoretically holding.  Not sure if this particular account exchanges or holds USD in trade for Nubits or not. 
How are the USD reserves the custodians handle tracked?  
Maybe I missed it in the whitepaper or the FAQ, but it seems like every custodian would be tempted to run a fractional reserve. 
In the whitepaper it mentions that it's expected that some custodians go rouge and take off with the money but expects this to be a small minority.  However, it seems to me that every custodian would be tempted to run a fractional reserve at some point.  What is the expected losses, will this affect the trade price?  In the early days probably most people involved are fairly trustworthy, but down the road I think more and more unsavory types will get involved and at some point significant losses will accumulate and when the price can't be maintained at $1 there will be fire sale and it will be all done.
The security model of Bitcoin assumes that every individual person is a thief and will do everything in their power to increase their own wealth.  What keeps us safe is that a group of thiefs working together will never get &gt; 51% of the hashing power.  However, in Nubits it looks like each custodian has the potential to steal and the security model is what % of custodians can we make sure are honest and won't steal.
Legit concerns, not trying to flame.

Still the nothing at stake claim bypasses the whole fact that the people who are forging by definition have stake in the system.  So, if they don't want to loose all their coins they shouldn't run a malicious piece of code.    Take bitcoin, there is bitundo that people can mine on their pool to get paid extra to provide double spend capabilities.  If everyone mined at that pool Bitcoin would have the same problem.  But, again the whole security relies on the fact that at least 50% of the users are honest users.  If the nothing at stake argument has any merit you would have to admin bitcoin has the exact same problem with bitundo.
PoS also has a "best" measurement just like bitcoin.  Consensus in NXT is not governed by the longest chain but by the chain with the highest cumulative difficulty.  This will be the chain that has the most amount of stake creating it.  So, again you will always be able to find the chain with the most stake backing it because it will have the largest difficulty.  If you try to fake a chain back in time with just a smaller amount of stake the time you will have to wait in between block generation will be longer and also have a lower cumulative difficulty as that drops based on the time in between blocks.
From the wiki:
"A cumulative difficulty value is stored as a parameter in each block, and each subsequent block derives its new difficulty from the previous blocks value. In case of ambiguity, the network achieves consensus by selecting the block or chain fragment with the highest cumulative difficulty. "
"Contrast with Peercoin Proof of Stake
Peercoin uses a coin age parameter as part of its mining probability algorithm. In that system, the longer your Peercoins have been stationary in your account (to a maximum of 90 days), the more power (coin age) they have to mint a block. The act of minting a block requires the consumption of coin age value, and the network determines consensus by selecting the chain with the largest total consumed coin age.
When Peercoin blocks are orphaned, the consumed coin age is released back to the blocks originating account. As a result, the cost to attack the Peercoin network is low, since attackers can keep attempting to generate blocks (referred to as grinding stake) until they succeed. Peercoin minimizes these and other risks by centrally broadcasting blockchain checkpoints several times a day, to freeze the blockchain and lock in transactions.
Nxt does not use coin age as part of its forging algorithm. An account’s chance to forge a block depends only on its effective balance (which is a property of each account), the time since the last block (which is shared by all forging accounts) and the base target value (which is also shared by all accounts)."
There is also a sliding window 1440 blocks that could kind of be thought of a checkpoint but it's done automatically by the clients, not the developers.  This is necessary to prevent attacks where account leasing power is moved around rapidly to try and generate a false chain.  Thus coins must be stationary for 1440 blocks before they can forge.
I've personally not thought about the DoS risks, ill have to research more about that.  All of these are great questions though and it is always possible some attack will be found, however, I still think ultimately it's not an unsolvable problem and PoS just provides a more efficient solution.  I've not even really looked into transparent forging yet.  It's supposed to provide 10x the tps while also making it require 90% of the forging power to be malicious to pose a threat to the network.... I'll need to dig into that and find out more and to understand how that can be possible.    Sounds like a good topic for a future video.
