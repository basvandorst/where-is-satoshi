PMs can be sold for cash or BTC.
If you bought PM and sold at some point the cash can be held in your account, not in a bank.
Personally, I would hold as much BTC as possible.
Only cash in for your immediate expenses.  In this case a BTC Debit Card would be practical.
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:07:14
Be careful.
BTC = Bitcoin
BCH/Bcash = BitcoinCash
They are not the same.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:13:26
You store the PM in their vaults.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:03:31

Much safer.  They accept BTC.

I just remembered, my first BTC trade was with LBTC in 2013.
My situation is slightly different to most.  I have a bank account in three countries.  LBTC is very convenient for me when I need to buy or sell.
Gives me a warm feeling knowing banks are not getting any fees.

Transfer/Store it wherever you choose.
Transfer back to where you bought if you want to sell.
Each transfer will have a miner fee.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:45:08
If you can afford to buy BTC once or twice a month, keep doing it, and hold.  
Cost averaging works well.
A strategy: If price is rising buy less.  If dropping buy more.

I use    for all my buy &amp; sells now.
Became annoying to use large exchanges that take days to credit/debit your account.  Worse than banks.
At least with LBTC it is a private individual getting the profit who possibly has a family.
I always prefer helping the small guy.

Bullion in Singapore
Singapore is simply the best country in the world to buy and store bullion.
Singapore is the free-trade capital of the world and has a solid reputation in terms of property rights protection and ease of doing business. These conditions together with below mentioned advantages makes Singapore the ideal location for storing precious metals.
Tax-Free - There is no tax for bullion whatsoever in Singapore. No GST/VAT/Sales tax and no capital gains tax. 
No Reporting Requirements - There are no domestic or international reporting requirements for buying, selling or storing gold in Singapore. No permits are necessary to import or export investment precious metals.
Cash Allowed - Cash makes sense. There is no counter party risk involved for cash and carry. If you settle in cash, you don't have to place any trust in anyone. You get the bullion, we get the cash.
Safety &amp; Security - The crime rate in Singapore is among the lowest in the world. Violent crime is almost unheard of. There's a strong rule of law in Singapore. You can take physical possession and walk out with your precious metals without any problem.
Property Ownership Rights - Singapore is politically stable with strong property ownership rights protection. 
Business Climate - Singapore consistently ranks top three globally in business climate reports measuring how easy and straightforward it is to conduct business in different countries.
Laws and Regulations - While governments in the EU and the USA try to curb investments into precious metals by introducing legislation that makes it difficult to purchase precious metals, the government of Singapore is dedicated to transform Singapore into a trading hub for precious metals. The Singaporean government encourages bullion dealers and refineries to set up their business in Singapore with the objective of increasing Singapore’s share of the global gold market from the present 2 % of global gold trade to 10 % by 2020.
Independence from the EU &amp; USA - Singapore has no jurisdictional ties to the US or any country in Europe. Singapore is proud of its independence.
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:21:23
You can sell for BTC or go there and take the cash.
If you want cash use&gt; 
Meet with the trader.
Another option is a BTC debit card.  Load and spend.
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:38:06
Yes, correct, they use Escrow.
I have used LBTC for several years.
If using make sure you use a trader with good feedback score and large volume.
Trades take less than five minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-28 09:50:05
If it is a small amount, buy now and hold.
If it is a large amount, buy with equal amounts over the next four weeks, or months if you prefer.
Cost averaging works well.
If price is going up, buy less.  If price going down, buy more.

My experience yesterday.  
Registered with Circle&gt;added UK debit card&gt;bought BTC&gt;BTC appears in wallet&gt;transfer to my personal wallet.  
All happened in about 15mins.  Excellent service.
But, Circle is not the cheapest place to buy.  For me, with a UK bank account, and being a non-resident of the UK is to use BitStamp.  The most economical but not the fastest way to buy/sell.  Getting funds into and out of BitStamp is the slowest part, everything else is very frictionless.
Circle would be a great starter for newbs to become familiar with BTC.

Option 2.  Buy BTC through LocalBitcoins with GBP.  Send BTC to your wallet.

Would be better if merchants received BTC and spent BTC, not cash in.  
The design of BTC is for it stay circulating as BTC, not cashing out.
The best use of BTC is buy/spend/buy.
I thought we wanted to get rid of the banksters.  Will not happen for a long time if this rollercoaster ride continues.
Keep merchants out unless they keep BTC.

Depends on the price you bought BTC, if you bought for US$900/BTC then not good to use at this point.
But, having said that, the best way is to use BTC and replace.
Buy, spend, buy is the way to go.

Do not keep your BTC in a wallet that you do not hold the private keys. ie. Circle.
Use, BitGo, Electrum, Armoury or similar.
Circle is limited to the amount you can buy if you do not have a US bank account, at this time.
Using SEPA from UK I am charged a GBP10.00 bank fee for the transfer to BitStamp.  OK if you are transferring GBP10,00.00 but not good if transferring GBP100.00  I have used Bittylicious-UK, they are expensive.
Important to calculate what the current cost of BTC is and what the actual cost to buy/sell is. Then decide which exchange to use.
@_date: 2014-07-18 12:12:38
Try Electrum, very good, you hold the private keys.
Only use exchange wallets to buy/sell and then transfer to your personal wallet.

The box to the right of "color" gives a new code, not sure if you use a new code each time you open Coinffeine, have not used it yet.

Yes.  I have used them many times.
You may be asked to send photos of you and your ID.
Use one of the sellers that has made many transactions.
@_date: 2016-09-09 03:53:34
I know they are high, but, sometimes you have to pay for convenience.  Depends on your personal circumstances.
I would prefer to pay fees and use BTC.  I live in Asia, it works well for me.
@_date: 2016-09-08 11:17:02
I find BTC so easy to use, wish more people realised the fact.  
I have a CryptoPay Debit Card load it with BTC, spend anywhere in the world.
@_date: 2017-09-12 18:21:31
  is good

I have used two exchanges for several years, never had a problem.
Compare the two and see who comes up with the best price after taking all fees into account.
@_date: 2017-09-28 13:11:19
I should have said.  BitStamp can take several days to get the funds there.  LocalBitcoins is basically instant once you are registered and ready to go.
@_date: 2017-10-02 18:41:33
Good to hear.  Just make sure you use a reputable seller, one with large number of trades.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:01:56
Replace your BTC as soon as you can.  The future is bright.

Which means your average buy price is $4,650, that's OK.

Go to "Settings" in your Bittrex account.  You will see "Basic Verification" and "Enhanced Verification".
Basic only gives you approval for small withdrawals.  Enhanced increases your withdrawal amount.

Possibly, buy every couple of weeks using £2,000.00 each time.
If the market moves down you can always buy the dip.
Good way to average your buy price and time for you to see which direction the market is going.
Set up an account up with&gt;  
Local Bitcoins is quick and easy, I have been using them for years.
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:39:25
Whatever you can afford is the right move. 
Just buy and hold BTC at any price.  The future is very bright.
Think of the poor souls that do not have your vision and stay in fiat.

A quote from Twitter this morning.
"83% of all stocks are owned by 1% of the population. Yet media tells us to celebrate a high stock market ? ? ?"
Bitcoin is for everyone.  Go for it, $300.00 is not life threatening.

Why can't you just provide a receiving address and the customer advises you their sending address?
Keep the BTC and just cash in when needed.

Watch some YouTube videos with Andreas Antonopolous, James D'Angelo, MadBitcoins, BitcoinRush and others.  They are all very informative.

I found BitStamp very easy to register, prompt with replies to any questions.  Set up and verified in two days.
Have made two "buys" with them.
I live in Thailand and have bank accounts in UK, Australia and Thailand.  Have also bought with LocalBitcoins in Australia.  Have not bought in Thailand yet.  My experiences so far have been very acceptable.

There will always people buying/selling for many different reasons.

Do they use the Bitcoin?

Can only do that if they have the private keys.
