I study business informatics in Germany, so I don't have to pay student loans because Universities are free in Germany. I did a apprenticeship as a car mechanic but you won't get rich as a mechanic. I study because I want to get involved in the blockchain ecosystem. 
I think it's quite important to understand the economics and CS behind blockchains and why we need them. I try go gain as much knowledge as possible and since its free, I think its better than working your ass of in a job you don't like. I would probably think different about it if I had to pay the dept.

I study business informatics and I found it quite hart to get a job as a student in the 2nd semester. But I managed to get a job in a stock bank where I manage databases. I'll start mid August working there :) It's a step in the right direction.

You only get student loans under certain conditions which I don't meet..

That's exactly what I try to do! I'll start working in a stock bank next month to manage databases, next step I guess is to look for a blockchain company after I gained some experience in this sector. Still a long way to go but I'm motivated to get stuff done :)

Try to educate them with a small presentation and show them your passion about it. If you get pocket money, ask them to get half of it in Bitcoin. Watch a few YouTube tutorials on how to buy Bitcoin (if you haven't done it already) and then teach your parents how to do it. Learn how to store btc and learn about the risks that are involved. 
My parents were also against a investment in btc but now they ask me how my investmen is growing and they want to know more about the technology behind it. :)
