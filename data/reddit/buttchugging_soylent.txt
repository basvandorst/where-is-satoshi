Roll my fucking eyes, you're posting on a public forum. As much as it pains me to side with a trump supporter your hypocrisy is just too fucking blatant not to call out.

You think you can just deny personhood to living beings with feelings? That's exactly how the slave owners thought of their slaves. Google it if you dont believe me.

You're probably looking at a 12 year commitment... who gives a shit whether it's $20 or $200.

You're really going to say that then two replies down try to call someone out for choosing insults over discussion? You really are a hypocritical piece of shit.

Wow!!! Having a kid, what an innovative concept; as if there weren’t enough stray good boys and girls out there in need of a loving home
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:50:01
That's like saying having a kid is free because there's no fee.

Damn, that BCH price must be soaring today then.

What a load of shit.

You'd have to order a lot of fucking pretzel boards to make it worth the tx fee.

Are you super retarded?
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:41:37
Are you really questioning someone's compassion by calling them a retard? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:55:16
You must be still reeling from being banned.

How many of them are adopting kids verses having their own do you think?

Dogs aren't free stop telling people this
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:49:33
Less and less actually, we're going to the moon brother. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:38:33
I agree. We need to give dogs the vote.

I like that graph's level of detail but I always preferred this site for at-a-glance fee estimation [
