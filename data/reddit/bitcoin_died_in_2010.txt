Wrong, they've just been since downvoted.

Downvote brigade w/ thousands of accounts. Its crazy that this was an actual service people pay for and what is worse is it wasn't just Bitcoin. It was any topic. Whoever was willing to pay.
Any idea how much it cost and what you got in return?

What are you afraid of? Be a whistle blower. Give more details if this is true. What do you think reddit or any other forum could do to combat this kind of thing?

I think this should be stickied by the mods in case what this person says is true.

Seeing all the downvote-spree in the comments, you're old colleagues might caught up to this thread, lol.

I am sure you are aware, but several of the people who visit this subreddit can provide you a substantial amount of money, as well as legal and physical protection, to bring this story to the public.
And check out this guy who is still taking it very seriously:
I attempted to explain that it downvoted because it was proven to be bullshit, but apparently I'm just a Zionist shill or something like that.


Sounds like you're upset because you and the other turds have been caught out for being gullible fools, as one would expect of Bitcoiners.

You either get shadowbanned by the automoderator, by one of mods, or by one of the Reddit admins.
Shadowbanning here is common, especially of those who speak against Bitcoin ('trolling' a.k.a. criticizing Bitcoin is a bannable offense)

It's been plagarized - it's a complete fabrication. 
How gullible are you?
