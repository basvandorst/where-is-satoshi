To be fair, Patreon has a very small team, and Bitcoin integration probably isn't number one on any one person's to-do list.

Something like 1% + $0.15 USD, I think.

I use litecoin miner programs for pools because doge also has a scrypt-based PoW, but the Qt has it built in for solo.
edit: apparently the Qt also has pool mining. huh.

I would not suggest taking out loans to buy BTC.

GPU mining USDs isn't profitable any more, you lose money on the energy costs. MAYBE try ASICs, but you should really check with a calculator first.

Came here to say this. What's the point of a flag-changer client like this? Any Bitcoiner following these goings-on would make this kind of mental substitution anyway (that is, seeing an "officially" marked "clean" coin and thinking about what that means, vs. an unencumbered one), and those people NOT following this wouldn't know about the forked client to have it in the first place. I'm just seeing a perpetuation of the tracking they want to implement, instead of an option to eliminate it.
I agree with ideological opposition to CoInvalidation (wordplay which I'm going to have to use now!), but I don't know if this proposed forked client -- which still permits this reduction of BTC fungibility -- is precisely the way to go.

Oh, I wasn't commenting on other barriers, but that's valid as well of course. With increased usage and utility will come increased accessibility in terms of availability. However, the "conceptual difficulty" barrier to entry probably isn't going to go away, people will just adapt. Credit cards, for example, are always tough for new consumers to get a grasp on at first: how they actually work, how to use them effectively, how to not get screwed over, etc. But their high presence in the market makes them accessible not my simplifying the idea itself (people can and do easily land themselves waist-deep in credit card debt through misunderstanding), but instead adapting around it -- it's extremely easy to use a credit card in a store. Hopefully Bitcoin will go the same route.
So easier to buy into, yes. Easier to understand...well, maybe there will be clearer/more concise ways of explaining it to the uninitiated in the near future, but Bitcoin will still be Bitcoin.

The fees are going to be ridiculous if you find anyone trusting enough to accept it at all.

To assuage a bit of your hesitation, I can say that it's actually less risky now. In the early months it was very possible that it would flop entirely. Now, with entire businesses built around bitcoin (exchanges, mining rig manufacturers, shops, etc), higher demand, and serious media coverage, it's slowly becoming a safer currency to use. (It's risky if you're looking to spend big bucks on BTC hoping the exchange rate sways in your favor, though.)

It's a *digital* currency. "Virtual" can be related to computers or the internet, but the primary definition is "very close to being something without actually being it", or "simulated". "Virtual" is used with computing for things that aren't "real", in a sense -- a "virtual world" or "virtual reality".
Bitcoin is real, and should be disassociated from these connotations.

Economically speaking, those are pretty much equivalent. Risk analysis is a part of an investment's value. If you saw it as less risky, then it would be more valuable, and you'd work harder to free up even more money for investing.
Investors know bitcoin has potential, that's why there are people investing in it. The price is where it is right now due to its potential AND the counteracting force of the risk involved.

He did tip. The bot is blocked, so it can't post verifications, but the little green check still shows up by his name so it looks like the tip actually did go through.

Yeah, wasn't this the drama when Bank of America announced a $5/mo fee for debit transactions and everyone went apeshit so they didn't do it?

I like it as a tipping crypto because you can tip whole coins and it still be a small amount. Tipping 0.00001 BTC is discouraging, but 10 DOGE is a funny and friendly welcome to crypto. I wouldn't buy it, though. I just use the faucets and mine a bit.

if they've already paid for themselves and they run ideally, I think you still make more than it costs in power, but only just.

I'm learning American Sign Language now, and I swear, *every* time I glance at the sub and see "Bitcoin Sign finally here!" I think some Deaf person has actually come up with a sign for "Bitcoin" so I don't have to fingerspell it if/when I want to discuss it in the real world.

Just to be fair (nitpicky), coingig is like a more BTC-friendly etsy, not really ebay.

I wouldn't suggest a flat Bitcoin rate. Merchants can want what they want in terms of Bitcoin independency, but like it or not, Bitcoin trades for fiat and that trading value changes a lot. Bitcoin is still small in terms of worldwide currencies by trading volume. Until that evens out in the long term, BTC-fiat trading is going to be a major factor in the economy. Flat Bitcoin rates right now means that in as little as a week to a month whatever you're selling is going to be grossly overpriced.

Very true about the difficulty. It'd hopefully be easy to show it isn't a scam since it doesn't require any personal information to use and it can only be used to send, not request, money, but I doubt a site handling spam reports would look enough into it on their own to see that.
I was thinking less about Youtube (not for lack of desire, but more because of the G+ shitstorm that's still raging) and more about Tumblr just because that's a site I'm on more frequently. The staff isn't exactly hands off (they've tried to shut down API-heavy add-ons in the past), but they're not hugely observant of non-resource-heavy add-ons. If the tipping interface there were more add-on based (since I sense they wouldn't be friendly to bot-accounts based on reading through their terms), though, the problem here would be contacting users without the add-on since messages are time-limited (ridiculously low, like 10/hr) and some people choose not to activate them at all.
I imagine Facebook, as you said, wouldn't be terrible to implement but I question the usefulness since generally that's solely personal info. I can come up with situations where the system would be useful, but they're fewer and further between than the content publishing sites. Plus, many people put on a "public face" for these other sites, but are more protective of their Facebook, so I think a money-related thing would look more scammy there.
Twitter, actually, I think could be somewhat easy. I think spambots there are actually ridiculously easy to spot, so I wouldn't worry so much if the tipbot account were made to look at least a little refined and the bio linked to a nonthreatening site. I actually think integrating the system a bit off of Twitter would be a possible work-around to the DM limitation issue. Using the third-party application system isn't terribly painful and it gives the user the constant option of revoking access. I could imagine the following exchange not being seen as overtly spammy if the account and website looked clean enough:






I feel like seeing that a real user (who actually follows the original tweeter) make the command first would be beneficial. Of course, it's also easy for more popular users to not ever check 
Anyway, you can see that my versions of tip bots wouldn't exactly be "pure" like the reddit one. The format of this site seems to lend itself to more robust, automatized bots. I feel like other sites might need a bit of external support to be secure and useable.
