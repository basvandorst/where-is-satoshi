Considering they collected the evidence illegally, that's not really a technicality. Justice has to follow the rules, not just shoot from the hip. Unless you think the U.S. should just use kangaroo courts

Cheers, man!

if there weren't good odds playing it then casinos wouldn't run it. I'm not sure why BTC casinos wouldn't play it =(

I can't play bitcoin craps yet, so rabble.

WOW! I think you're running for my district (I'm along north Lamar)! At least according to 
What can I do to help your campaign? After reading all of your campaign points and issues it seems like you're dead in line with my views!

no, random number generators are effectively hashing algorithms, where the seed to the RNG is the input to the hash. A hashing algorithm is a one-way function, so it is computationally intractable to work it backwards to find the original input to the function.
This concept is a core building block in how the bitcoin protocol builds the blockchain.

If they illegally search your home or property to find that, it doesn't matter? Because the fourth amendment would like a word with you

I just expect our law enforcement to follow the law, fuck me right?

what are the upsides of vertcoin, and is there a reputable exchange I could do business with?
@_date: 2014-06-27 02:16:37
dear lord I can't believe that they wouldn't use the last wallet generated as the seed for the new random number generator for the next wallet. It's such an easy step to take and it gives them a ton more randomness to their random numbers
@_date: 2014-04-01 23:17:27
same, I'm thrilled to be able to pick up more BTC!
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:36:18
it could be classified as a like-item exchange, which in same cases you can exempt as spending.

Are you kidding me?? It totally matters how the prosecution collects evidence! Defendants have a right to not self-incriminate, and they also have a right to protest illegally collected evidence. 
You're saying that it doesn't matter if you're doing something wrong, the authorities do not have to follow due process of law in their prosecution?

it looks like there's a buy wall around $1000
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:01:17
prices seem to line up with bitcoinity
@_date: 2017-03-02 21:32:16
that's a fantastic gif, nice find lol
@_date: 2017-01-01 20:32:34
Based on previous BTC behavior and patterns I'd expect the price to at least double from where it is now. It's following the cycle it's been through three times already
@_date: 2017-01-06 22:08:11
uhhh tweet at them? If you get the PR folks involved they tend to move fast
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:09:29
The pattern has always been big site then asking to around double what it was pre spike
@_date: 2015-11-04 15:20:46
likely within a month or so I'd bet

solution - cash out to euros or whatever and transfer to USD. boomsauce

would it be possible to host the app file for us to download? I mean like is it that sort of thing possible or would it be missing the apple signature so it couldn't run on iOS w/o jailbreak
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:25:58
interesting... whenever I buy through coinbase it's always delayed 4 business days, which kind of sucks....
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:49:20
that time will most likely be on Sunday. For some reason prices tend to depress that day
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:52:37
you need to be at the top. Wish they'd give a better form of notice for when downtime happens
@_date: 2013-11-27 23:01:53
anyone near you with localbitcoins?
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:28:58
So my understanding is that they pull the money from your account so they'll have it in hand and ready to exchange for BTC once there is some available to them. If you read the agreement it states this fairly clearly
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:42:19
Welp. That's gonna be a bummer. Another reminder to keep a smaller balance on there for me. Fingers crossed that I'm not about to lose some money.
EDIT: It's back for me? Security certificate still intact too... 
EDIT 2 Electric Boogaloo: Nope, back down. fuckberries

I dunno, as someone who's hardware is way out of league for bitcoin mining, I've already made .05BTC through mining LTC and trading for BTC. Not a bad option tbh. I'm definitely not planning on keeping LTC but it's a superb vehicle to acquire more low cost BTC
@_date: 2013-11-21 05:06:25
no that's a horrid idea. You should delete the files and then shred your hard drive.
..... OF COURSE YOU SHOULD! They look great lol
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:14:06
even if you bought at 530, if the transaction hasn't finished you get the market price of BTC when the transaction is actually completed.
Example. I bought at 580, and my transaction is completing in a few hours. I'm getting a fairly high price for my BTC. sadface

Where is this bitcoin store?
