Assuming there are (very) roughly 800 words in this image...
Assuming there is a 12-word-mnemonic hidden inside...
What's the chance you could randomly pick out the *correct* sequence of 12 words?
Each time you pick out a word, it gets removed from the set, so, the chance to correctly pick the 12 words in order would be (I think) equivalent to:


or in other words

I've browsed some of your previous posts, and from what I gather the 12-word phrase is wallet-independent. 
Do you have an alternative for a macOS device whereby I could try my 12 word recovery phrase?

Okay, so I'm back into Blockchain.info... turns out I have some "Imported Addresses" (news to me) which hold the other 90% of my funds... I'm not really sure what this means, but I think I'd like cold storage these.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:59:47
That's what I thought.
[This is the address](
) which is showing 10% of funds *when logged in*, although when looking anonymously it just shows '0'.
And it seems that the original address is still active, as it's asking me for passwords + 2FA... ?
EDIT: Now I'm very confused, because from what I've read the 12 word passphrase recreates the same wallet address, but after I used it on blockchain.info it gave me a *new* wallet address... so now I have two wallets? Makes no sense to me.

I'm literally on it like Sonic. You can't believe the near-heart-attack I had when I though my BTC had somehow been lost in the ether.

Sorry if a dumb question but isn't (one of) the whole purpose of Bitcoin to prevent things like this happening? What's the point of a decentralised currency if an org like Bitpay can decide to suspend certain transactions?

Pretty sure you could buy guns on there.

Yeah, your description of Silk Road is right: a place to "post what you want within reason". DPR knew exactly what he was getting into, and knew the consequences if he fucked up. He fucked up. The internet is fucked up, but why does DPR need to be on a digital pedestal? 
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:02:09
It's very relevant to the discussion IMO.
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:32:56
Since I've been reading these comments I've learnt that the modern version (3.0) of the Silk Road prohibits the sale of *“anything whose purpose is to harm or defraud.”*
However, the DPR case was four years ago in 2013 - when there were no such restrictions; you could buy weed just as easily as guns. 
See [here]( for more info.

Most other people on this comment thread completely deny that you could buy these things from the SR. At least you admit that they *were* for sale, even if they are not anymore.
Which brings me back to my point (and the point of many many others): DPR ran a black market - why put him on a pedestal?
If Bitcoin is ever going to be a viable and *valuable* store of wealth, it needs to be accepted by the masses, not just a small minority of EDIT: And when I say "why put him on a pedestal", I don't mean necessarily let's debase him outright. Can we not just treat him as 'something that happened in Bitcoins past'... a neutral entity.

Who knows, maybe this was an intention at one point. But it certainly didn't work out like that.

Regardless whether he was a fall guy, regardless of whether he *really* did hire hitmen or not, he for sure helped to run a website were you could *effectiviely* hire hitmen, and worse. 
Making a psuedo-matyr of him doesn't help our cause.
@_date: 2017-05-22 21:22:17
I get what you're trying to say, but we were talking about the sale of *weapons* and *hitmen services* on Silk Road, not just the drugs trade - which I agree does need reform in society, at least for cannabis. 
(Also, Elon Musk builds rockets to send people to Mars whilst simultaneously ushering in realistic solar energy production. DPR managed an online anonymous marketplace where you could buy weed and guns. Not really a fair comparison.)
@_date: 2017-05-22 23:17:10
^(In most Western countries the sale of guns is prohibited, they are in mine.)
And while they may not have *officially* been allowed on SR, there was a period in 2012/2013 (before the older version of the site was taken down) when SR featured a weapons section. Admittedly, DPR did try and shut it down. 
EDIT: wording
@_date: 2017-05-22 20:51:43


With this thinking, you could justify selling gunpowder in sweet shops... or in this case, selling guns on Amazon.com.
There's a difference between a product that *can* be used to kill versus a product that's made *specifically* to kill. 


So having listings for hitmen is a-okay as long as we *think* the listings might be fake? 
Nah man.

BTC is **more** digital than the $ though
