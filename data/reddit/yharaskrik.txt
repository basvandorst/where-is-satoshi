Thank you that is what I thought but I am writing a paper and am doing a literature review of a paper that uses a ratio which didn't add up if this was the case.
@_date: 2014-06-15 02:45:45
Ya that's not an issue we are just trying to avoid the bank fees! 
@_date: 2014-05-31 15:47:42
I'm down let's do it
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:20:29
No that was a mistake what I said, it wasn't my backups, if you refer to my other comments I say that the TFA authenticators were on my CTO's phone which he himself may or may not have backed up. He does not manage my backups nor does he have access to my phone. 
But yes we learned from the mistakes we did make. Just a shame it took something like this for us to learn.
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:38:32
Agreed, like I have said the only other two people in the company are my CTO and CFO both founders and have known them since I was a child so I would like to think it wasn't either one of them.
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:49:18
Hahahah oh man I didn't click anything or anything like that just browsed on my phone then exited it.
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:12:50
Well we do not know she used it as it is not a "shared" computer. It is a private computer in his room where she isn't allowed in, which is also password protected. So unless she walked in sometime when he wasn't there and it was logged in.. Then not to sure.
@_date: 2014-05-29 02:30:19
My company got accepted into plug and plays bitcoin startup accelerator! See you there man!
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:54:04
Just the roommate but she doesn't understand how to use netflix sometimes so...
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:48:35
That seems to be what some of the people here are saying, would like to not believe that because I have known them for so long, since I was a kid in elementary school.
@_date: 2014-08-04 18:30:59
Sometimes I absolutely hate being subscribed to the bitcoin subreddit. Over hearing the same shit over and over.
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:11:53
Ya our passwords were very strong and TFA was enabled on everything.
@_date: 2014-06-15 02:47:57
Thank you I will look through the list.
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:28:59
Ya not really sure as there are only three of us in the company (all founders) and the computer was the personal one at one of our houses.)
@_date: 2014-06-26 02:20:49
Unfortunately that is way to much work for a lot of people. But ya I've always wondered about these kinds of scams.. They wouldn't be around unless they worked right?
@_date: 2014-05-05 04:44:38
I support this
@_date: 2014-10-31 20:31:36
TIL satoshi nakamoto published the white paper on bitcoin on Halloween.
@_date: 2014-05-29 03:44:05
We are called Sha Software, based in BC, Canada. Yup plug and play in Sunnyvale. For sure that would be awesome! Pm me sometime we can meet up. We won't be there till august sometime as that's when our intake is.
@_date: 2014-10-21 20:59:31
Hey my last name is Bell! We are practically related.
@_date: 2014-06-25 22:54:50
That's the one! Hahah they have to work or else wouldn't exist right? 
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:04:01
What would be the best one to pay for to find the keylogger?
@_date: 2014-08-21 04:08:10
I sure hope this happens. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 14:31:12
I'm curious why you think this bill is garbage? What the bill is regulating (if I read it correctly) is bitcoin dealers (coin base bitstamp etc) that operate in Canada making them register with fintrac and employ anti money laundering plans etc. Which is good for bitcoin because every piece of bad news drops bitcoins price more than good news makes it rise. This regulation will help reduce the bad new (at least in Canada for now) but still allow bitcoin to be used for what it has been used for. Where is the harm?
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:34:02
Ya... Might consider that as an option from now on. A big piss off but nothing like something like this to make you realize what you have to do for security purposes
@_date: 2014-08-30 18:49:31
Hey! Big crypto fan, want to build a computer here soon to do some coding on and stuff get into game development. Hopefully I can afford haswell-e by then!
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:02:54
Nope just him.
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:06:32
I'll look into it! I rarely use my Netflix anyway.
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:50:50
Oh ya I have dual booted plenty of times and used Ubuntu quite a bit in the past.
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:49:26
My point exactly, I do not believe it was either one of them hahah. 
We do believe it was a keylogger and that is how they got the passwords etc its the TFA that is baffling us and suspicious.
Yes it seems like they have been watching us for a while as they knew almost everything account and spot where there were coins held and emptied it all out very quickly.
@_date: 2014-06-26 16:56:50
Ya exactly. Even with small incremental gains its still worth it cause it can't cost them that much. Oh older people are terrible for that!
@_date: 2014-06-15 05:12:21
oh shucks ok, do you know what kind of volume they deal with on a daily basis?
@_date: 2014-06-25 23:20:59
Oh for sure! Knew that from the start just thought I'd share with all of you
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:37:05
Ya exactly and I am not sure how they did as it was only on the one phone. I would have to ask my CTO where the backups are.
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:55:47
What else could we have done to keep them secure? We believe they had desktop access so somehow got in through teamviewer. Maybe don't use that at all? Our passwords were all secure and TFA enabled.
@_date: 2014-07-01 02:48:57
Oh it is so very ironic but it is unfortunate truth. 
Tragic irony but just one people in this space need to worry about.
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:33:22
Not any computer literate ones that understand what we are doing let alone know how to operate a bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:58:33
Ah that makes a lot more sense now, was not sure how they do that but now it makes sense. Thank you for the explanation.
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:49:29
Let me know when you make millions!!
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:10:37
Dr. Nefario? What are we in? Despicable me?
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:19:39
Well seeing there are only three of us in the company and we are all founders... hahaha
But ya we think it was a keylogger and understand thats how they got through the passwords we just don't get how they got through TFA on the accounts. 
Yes we are assuming everything is compromised right now and taking appropriate action. The machine that was compromised is being wiped clean with a fresh install right now. Thanks for the tips though and not being one of those "Well you are dumb" people! 
@_date: 2014-08-06 19:05:29
Oh ya I know how to do that. Doesn't change the fact Canada's sucks.
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:10:03
Ya she just wouldnt have had access to the computer anyway as it is password protected, but who knows she could have gotten on somehow right?
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:08:31
Besides the whole "Storing coins on online exchanges" what other mistakes did I make may I ask? Strong passwords, TFA what else should I have done?
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:57:26
No neither of them have and I just asked his computer is just disconnected from the internet he has not started the wipe yet.
@_date: 2014-08-10 04:09:09
My question is now if he write the mag strip data to new cards how can he not be traced? Like you would think that it would be way go easy to be caught.
@_date: 2014-07-27 05:27:07
Ya totally get that now hahahah. Thought it was ridiculous from the start.
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:34:55
That is very true, definitely an option we will look at, thanks for the information I never thought of it that way.
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:17:06
Ya like I said in the post we had google autenticator or text codes enabled on all the accounts.
@_date: 2014-07-27 05:26:31
Ya I figured it had to be some kind of a joke just had no prior knowledge of it so when I saw it this morning it was kind of a wtf moment. Thought I'd ask the community.
@_date: 2014-08-04 17:10:49
Now if only they would refund me for that miner that I never received...
@_date: 2014-08-06 16:14:45
I have Netflix in Canada and it sucks...
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:01:13
Ya I have seen them around. Will probably be investing in them from now. What is the difference between those and an offline computer that can be plugged into the internet whenever to sync?
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:05:41
Yup on cryptostocks. IPO's a while ago, back in october I believe is when we bought them. Should have cashed out when price was at 1000 and stocks at 0.4, but hey shoulda coulda woulda
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:56:52
Ok just curious about that.
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:18:24
I agree with this, yes I agree we need banks even though it goes against what bitcoin stands for some believe.
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:59:47
Hahaha no the Authenticators were on his phone as well. So he had access to the account as well. Not sure if he backs his phone up and/or where he puts them.
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:34:30
Its unfortunate we need such high security. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:02:39
The no was directed at the cracked software
and the last question is the last line about the roommate.
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:00:23
Ya I guess if it is real time. Just not sure how they would have done it not real time but explained it.
@_date: 2014-07-01 04:16:21
Especially if Stryker was the one that bestowed the logic upon you right?
@_date: 2014-07-01 03:42:38
Ya and we should have realized online exchanges aren't exactly the safest places for coins but we have no reason to believe it was the website that took them as coins went missing from other places as well, what is missing from thee quote you posted is they got through the TFA somehow.
@_date: 2014-06-25 20:20:12
I just went to there website for the first time. Seems legit right? I mean I'll just send these guys 10 BTC so I can 47 back! Wait.. I understand how the Nigerian prince made all his money now..
@_date: 2014-07-26 22:54:03
I just dont understand how they can regulate and make you register for use of an Open Source OS... like submitting fingerprints to the FBI? what?
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:57:31
Except that the government doesnt issue money. The federal reserve does which is a private entity, the government then buys that money from the FR at an interest rate.
@_date: 2017-01-03 02:44:05
puretrade doesn't seem to be operational at all either... So not sure what's up.
@_date: 2017-01-03 15:29:46
Update, just got this email back from Bitcoiniacs the company that had originally controlled cointrader.




@_date: 2017-01-03 02:52:40
Ah that would make sense. I have emailed their parent company to see what's up.
