While I hold a little bit of a few alts, I am now. “The Bitcoin Standard” pushes me over the edge. I’ll still hold onto the few alts I have though. Never know, but not buying anymore of em

Is bitcoin mined at all to take advantage of free electricity?
@_date: 2019-09-04 22:49:00
He said it’s free. How’s that stealing?
@_date: 2019-09-05 00:14:44
That’s unfortunate :(

True, but that’s also why I asked.

Most people suggest 10-20% should go into a retirement account. Maybe open a traditional retirement account and do 10% there and 10% bitcoin so as to not have all your eggs in one basket. You are, on the other hand, young enough to take on additional risk by going heavier into bitcoin. You can always change your numbers as time goes on though. Try to envision bitcoin as part of your retirement account- hold it for long term, don’t panic sell. Good luck!

If they can find a way to make money off the integration though, I don’t see why not. It’s just a simple iOS update on their part
