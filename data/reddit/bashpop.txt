Are you going to answer my question?

The FDA is unconstitutional.

Lobbying relies upon using the force of government to restrict and regulate in order to decrease competition. Lobbying is not about tilting toward less regulation, freedom, and liberty.

Goddamn. Fuck you, Stapper.

It should not be regulated. The mere creation or possession of software is not an infringement upon anyone's rights. The infringement would be in its use to cause harm or death.

The SEC is unconstitutional.

Because he doesn't understand what money is and what the properties of money are. Because "The US payment system is set up well for cash and credit cards" is not the purpose of Bitcoin or currency competition; it has everything to do with fiat money.

...in order to have one's political will imposed over others, and calling for the force of government to back it up.

The OP started this thread with a constitutional argument. The Constitution limits the federal government. Congress (and the rest of the federal government) does not have any constitutional authority to regulate products or to regulate financial transactions. If you aren't referring to the federal government, then who is "they" in your response?
@_date: 2014-07-28 20:10:43
Ah, yes.

Because they have statists on their board of directors, including a former vice president of the U.S., and they believe in the monopoly of currency and the government control of fiat money.
Pretty simple.
@_date: 2014-07-28 12:27:38
It's pretty clear? Cite the Constitution.
@_date: 2014-07-28 20:13:42
Let's go over this misconception of yours. Regulate does not mean control; it means to make regular, to keep functioning at a highly operational level, like a well-regulated clock. Additionally, this clause refers to relationships between the United States government and other governments. So, to keep commerce regular with foreign Nations, to keep commerce regular among the several States (meaning that no State can blockade other states), and to keep commerce regular with the Indian Tribes. It does not mean restricting commerce, but the very exact opposite: to keep the flow of commerce regular and uninterrupted. It does not mean to control business or businesses or control private individuals, and it does not mean to regulate financial transactions among private individuals.

Wow. Had no idea. Thanks. I thought mining had something to do with "discovering" bitcoins.

Thanks. So the odds of my being able to mine as one guy with one computer are ridiculously small.

Then tell me what is the purpose of lobbying if not having one's political will imposed over others.

You can't buy something that doesn't exist. Economies aren't driven by demand or consumption. Strong economies don't exist simply because people want something more strongly than another group. Production is the only thing that grows an economy. The economy is simply billions of individual exchanges of *produced* goods and services.
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:17:11
The lack of regulations isn't being imposed; it is someone's political will *using the force of government* behind it that is being imposed. Group A wants regulations. Group B doesn't. Group B wins. Group B's political will has been imposed on Group A.
When was lobbying used to prevent other people's political will from being imposed upon others? The answer is never; it is impossible due to the government monopoly on law making.
@_date: 2014-05-25 14:18:58
Roads, police, system of laws ... all are examples of government monopoly, and all are examples of failures. It is because of governmental monopoly over currency that Bitcoin was able to come about. You don't need government to have roads, police, or laws, and you don't need government to have an agreed upon means of exchange.

That's a pretty weak point.
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:56:42
There is no power granted Congress under [Article I, Section 8]( that allows it to regulate financial transactions.
@_date: 2014-05-22 17:21:14
What an odd reply.
@_date: 2014-05-25 21:08:04
And those pro-lobbyists are seeking to have their political will imposed upon others. Get it? But I asked for an example of when it was used to prevent other people's political will from being imposed on others.
@_date: 2014-07-28 12:32:26
That's not how the Constitution works. It doesn't list those things the federal government can't do, it lists those very few things the federal government can do. Anything not enumerated is not a power granted the federal government and is a right/power reserved to the states. The exception is the Bill of Rights, which is a list of things the federal government can't do, and was a means for the states to protect themselves from their creation.
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:05:27
Even regulating it would be unconstitutional. The commerce clause doesn't mean what you think it does.
@_date: 2014-07-28 01:51:37
And still unconstitutional.
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:55:45
That's impossible, but I'd love to hear an example.
@_date: 2014-07-28 12:33:47
Yes, Congress does have the power to make laws, but the laws it can make are very limited. Otherwise, why have a Constitution at all?
Article I, Section 8:
The Congress shall have power to lay and collect taxes, duties, imposts and excises, to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States; but all duties, imposts and excises shall be uniform throughout the United States;
To borrow money on the credit of the United States;
To regulate commerce with foreign nations, and among the several states, and with the Indian tribes;
To establish a uniform rule of naturalization, and uniform laws on the subject of bankruptcies throughout the United States;
To coin money, regulate the value thereof, and of foreign coin, and fix the standard of weights and measures;
To provide for the punishment of counterfeiting the securities and current coin of the United States;
To establish post offices and post roads;
To promote the progress of science and useful arts, by securing for limited times to authors and inventors the exclusive right to their respective writings and discoveries;
To constitute tribunals inferior to the Supreme Court;
To define and punish piracies and felonies committed on the high seas, and offenses against the law of nations;
To declare war, grant letters of marque and reprisal, and make rules concerning captures on land and water;
To raise and support armies, but no appropriation of money to that use shall be for a longer term than two years;
To provide and maintain a navy;
To make rules for the government and regulation of the land and naval forces;
To provide for calling forth the militia to execute the laws of the union, suppress insurrections and repel invasions;
To provide for organizing, arming, and disciplining, the militia, and for governing such part of them as may be employed in the service of the United States, reserving to the states respectively, the appointment of the officers, and the authority of training the militia according to the discipline prescribed by Congress;
To exercise exclusive legislation in all cases whatsoever, over such District (not exceeding ten miles square) as may, by cession of particular states, and the acceptance of Congress, become the seat of the government of the United States, and to exercise like authority over all places purchased by the consent of the legislature of the state in which the same shall be, for the erection of forts, magazines, arsenals, dockyards, and other needful buildings;--And
To make all laws which shall be necessary and proper for carrying into execution the foregoing powers, and all other powers vested by this Constitution in the government of the United States, or in any department or officer thereof.
That's it.

There is also no power under Article I, Section 8, that grants Congress any power to do so.

All government is inherently force and coercion imposed upon all of us without choice. EVERYTHING is inherently wrong with governments.
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:16:21
Irrelevant whether it's the only current regulation going on, because we both know the federal government is taking steps to do so.
