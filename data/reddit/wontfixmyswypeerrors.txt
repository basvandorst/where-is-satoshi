Those fees are passed straight to you through higher prices to make up for them.

So if I'm an old fuddy-duddy on v1.9.5 I'm ok?

In *all* gold rushes, the ones who make the most money are the ones who sell the shovels.

Is a new country's currency not considered a store of value while it's new and volatile? The volatility has been incredibly extreme but it's been up consistently over the long term as more people adopt it. I consider it like the internet itself forming a new currency the same way a new nation would. Sure, it currently has *more* volatility than other things because it's still undergoing adoption, but all assets have volatility... where do you draw the line? I just don't see something having volatility as an exclusion to it being a store of value. 
A smart place to store your value? That's up to the individual. A textbook definition store-of-value? Yes.

I haven't heard that one in the 5 years I've been involved with btc. What's the sentence that sounds similar? Genuinely curious.

I certainly should have been clearer in that I consider that one of its future attributes as well.  
But once the price reaches equilibrium and is more stable, I do see it as inflation-proof.  In that scenario, if my dollars are decreased in value by 10%, my bitcoin is by default worth 10% more of those dollars. 
Once we're at that point, even if Bitcoin doesn't pan out as a currency it would make sense to store my assets in Bitcoin and chip off fiat for spending as needed.

Because despite our best efforts, Bitcoin is not ready to be a currency yet. However right now today, what it *is* is a fantastic inflation-proof bulk commodity store of value, to be used alongside existing currencies. 
We'll get there one day (thisisntevenmyfinalform.jpg), we just need more time. 
Keep hodling.

It'll happen eventually, the Satoshi can't stay the smallest denomination forever. If Bitcoin goes over a million dollars usd per coin, we can no longer divide it by a penny. We'll need another decimal place.
20 years from now can we reference this thread and call the next decimal place a kernel?

I don't think bitcoin's use as a store of value has ever been questioned. Whether used as a currency or a commodity, it's something that can be saved, retrieved, exchanged, and has value to others who are willing to accept it. What am I missing?

This is why I sold half my holdings at $1200 *just* before the huge run up to $20k... It looks bad in hindsight, but at the time we were at the all time high, and there were rumors about Bitfinex being insolvent... the price should have gone down, and I would have bought the dip as intended. Instead we got this crazy run? Something shady went down.
