Because a government has the moral right to a unilateral decision on what a citizen can or cant do in the privacy of their own home ?
It's not enough that google edits their internet for them hmmm? 
In the end they will pursue what's most profitable for those in power, and if they can't leech money from it- they will ban it with threats of violence.

To mitigate potential losses in a worst case scenario. With the volatility of Bitcoin it could dip down overnight and be bought out from under you before rising higher the next day, so that's why I would never personally use a stop if I was on an exchange with btc.
Edit: if you want to day trade look at altcoins like xmr or ripple etc. Cheaper to get your foot in too

So if you don't have money you are basically trapped in that Texas town ? My god sounds like a bad twilight zone episode.

That's what the futures contracts are for. There needs to be a spot price and a daily price afaik to settle the contracts (ie BTC went up, or down)
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:24:48
They have "circuit breakers" which automatically halt the exchange after a 7% change. Seems ridiculous to me 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:21:40
Because most US customer will use coinbase to buy BTC which drives up prices on the exchange during peak hours.
Also coinbase likes to lag when convenient it seems

All I see is a storefront exchange profiting off bcash shitcoin listing and disabling their services during any dips or spikes to selfishly mitigate losses.
Coinbase has no segwit or intention to further Bitcoin development, they have turned into a corrupt cash grab cabal of criminals profiting in the short term at the expense of bitcoin's long term integrity.

No it wasn't a good business decision, as we can see from them freezing all bch trading immediately after pumping it. Maybe makes business sense for a business who doesn't give a shit about reputation or an equal playing field.
This was a decision based on short sighted greed and nothing more.
They don't need to support my utopian idea of freedom from economic shackles- but I will call them out and cease using their service when they act the opposite.

Exactly. I'll hold btc till I die if it means standing for integrity and independence. 
The extremely myopic view of transaction fees being high in the short term is pathetic when looking at the larger social and economic implications brought by the amazing btc.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:28:57
That's my point my friend, Reddit will lag behind but the graphs are real time. Maybe in the daily discussion thread you will find up to date info. I love Reddit too ! :D
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:20:59
Coinbase will be hacked, funds will be stolen probably by corrupt insiders. Nothing will surprise me after they corruptly added bcash shitcoin to their legitimate coins to profit in the short term

Because he is retard
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:32:37
It doesn't seem absurd when you learn the price they determine is independent of exchanges with zero fees (like South Korea) who make it much easier to pump and dump 
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:44:54
Once you get too far the exchange loses its grip on people by the balls, much like banks, and they will become an obsolete institution by decentralization and atomic swaps. Dragging their feet on improvements slows their own death

@_date: 2018-05-30 20:46:18
It doesn't make sense because bcore is a Dev group/company. Not interchangeable with the actual cryptocurrency Bitcoin or btc.
Bcash and bch are different because they are indeed interchangeable- since they both refer to the cryptocurrency Bitcoin cash.
Any other questions ? :)
@_date: 2018-05-30 18:27:51
Because the mods ban you if you call someone a stupid head (source: was banned).

@_date: 2018-05-31 22:16:22
No. Wrong.
You started from a dishonest premise and have told me nothing new. We are still on the same topic pal.
Let me draw you a clearer comparison:
Bch is indeed Bitcoin cash. NOT rogercoin.
Btc is Bitcoin. NOT bcore.
Understand? I hope we are on the same page now.
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:22:19
That is a completely retarded method of thinking if you don't mind me pointing that out.
This is not a lemonade stand or taco shop. 
An exchange needs access to huge amount of liquidity to function properly and if you can't spend an extremely small amount to have an exchange that at least looks as good as polo-the exchange is a scam. 
Definitely NOT someone who I would trust with thousands of dollars.....but I might buy a lemonade
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:17:03
.....or more likely an excuse to either not credit users during the fork and embezzle, or no strong incentive to list if exchange popped up after the fork anyway.
@_date: 2018-05-31 04:37:22
When you have no new value to offer, stealing a name seems like the best option.
@_date: 2018-05-31 04:33:06
I hope you realize literally no one on the planet says "bcore" when referring to Bitcoin, except of course bcash shills. :P
Hmmm which is Right or wrong ?? Who am I to judge, I say let the free market decide the best crypto !
If you can't grasp that time is linear and bcash is a fork of Bitcoin (protocol) then dialogue is simply impossible. You are using dishonest and bizzare definitions to fit your desired world view.
@_date: 2018-05-31 23:01:51
Those terms are still interchangable when referring to the crypto bch........
Literally just truncating the name from Bitcoin cash to bcash does not change the meaning somehow.
Again, I have to tell you I am not wrong.
Excellent ad hominem attempt RIGHT after just accusing me of ad hominem ! Haha
I look forward to your informed and well thought-out reply :)
@_date: 2018-05-26 05:07:15

His post history is clean as far as I can tell so no reason to accuse him of being a Roger Ver synth....

I agree completely with this post. For all their bragging about being KYC and money transferring/licensing compliant blah blah but as soon as their is a dip in BTC price their systems magically stop working. If it was a price soar I am sure their CPUS would be overclocked. And for the price they charge on "fees" there is no excuse for bullshit like this to be permitted.

Ok well I ask you to appeal to simple logic, seems to me the best way to launder or simply convert a massive amount of BTC to fiat would be through creating your own exchange. If I am wrong please correct me....

To place limits on selling based on how you "feel" it will affect "the market" is the definition of anti freemarket and will probably result in him not selling any, since those conditions are silly and superfluous.

You don't fully understand how they used tether, neither did I for a while.

The potential is huge though (like Bitcoin) and doesn't take away from it's value by existing.

What? 
Vitalik added value to blockchain technology by developing ETH. Bitcoin is a currency, eth is for dapps etc.
No reason to hate on a mathematical genius who improved technology. It's not like he is some asshole who forked Bitcoin and then tries to steal its namesake via lies....

Yes I would not be a smartass while outnumbered, very unwise.

 I can definitely see where you are coming from and might have thought similar in the past.
But to be honest the "fair" government is an unrealistic utopian idea since, as we all know, absolute power corrupts absolutely!
The only way to guarantee individual freedoms is to empower people as individuals. We cannot trust a church or state to provide with utter benevolence.
Until we realize this we are stuck with global wars, a corrupt healthcare system, a national deficit, and etc that make no logical sense for the "group's" well being as a whole. Our current system mainly keeps economic elites in power.

The price and market cap are very closely because it gives a rough evaluation based on circulating supply.
Arbitrage is an issue too but when the btc ath market cap shrunk to... a 1/3 of what it was so did price ��

Yes the Nazis tried that. Didn't work.

I'd suck my own dick for $100k a tweet like he gets����
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:24:19
Hmmm yes I see how there can be discrepancies from coinmarketcap's historical trends showing so.
In your "one Bitcoin on the planet scenario" we would also assume it's value is at least 9500 since it was sold for it, I'd hope the buyer would charge higher than a $1 markup. Anyway in your scenario bitcoin's market cap is only 9500 because since it's the only exchange it makes up the entirety of volume too, removing market forces of bids and asks to set price apart from it's apparent singularity in your scenario.
Unless I'm wrong which is entirely possible, but I've given this some specific topic some thought. Cheers
