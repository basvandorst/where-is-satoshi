I live in a giant bucket.
@_date: 2019-07-19 06:27:35
Yeah but there isn’t even 2 trillion actual dollars.
@_date: 2014-06-08 19:38:30
Exactly. Why would anyone carry 21,000 dollars in their wallet is beyond me. Also someone said in this thread that bitcoin is useless lol. What a joke! Bitcoin's transaction speed is far faster than any credit card companie's transaction speed. I sold artwork with the square device on my iPhone last Tuesday and the money still has not reached my account. I have $3.00 in the bank at the moment. I need that money now, and if we were all using bitcoin I would be able to use it. Pisses me off. I want everyone to use bitcoin already. This US DOLLAR BULLSHIT IS GETTING OLD!!!

What?????????? I read that like ten times to try and understand what you are trying to say! Lololol 
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:06:42
Exactly. You nailed it. If it went to ten bucks, there could be 100 reasons as to why. Like the dollar value going to the moon although that will probably never happen. Bitcoin can be rebooted, and at ten bucks it will probably make a wild comeback. It's 100 lines of Python code. Of it breaks it can easily be fixed. That's why I would keep buying more as well. Bitcoin is here to stay. Cheers to bitcoin!

Welp. That's the idea. Max keister said recently that world war three is going to begin with sanctions and end with bitcoin. I have a hunch that he is right.
@_date: 2014-12-31 14:13:22
I did it with a baby. It was a challenge. But we didn't go to the moon because it was easy.
@_date: 2014-10-13 04:12:15
What's gong on with that anyway. I love the concept. 
@_date: 2014-06-07 16:09:40
Phones are not secure enough to hold 21 btc. There is your answer.
@_date: 2014-10-26 06:51:55
When I went there it seemed that way and everyone seemed happy. It's nice being around that.

I haven't even noticed small fees when using my paypal card. I bought a game on steam last night so there's my proof.
@_date: 2014-06-14 02:47:16
Are you fucking kidding me? How I have not heard this before? Does anyone have any proof?
@_date: 2014-02-06 01:24:18
That's what I'm talking about! Deny that shit Apple! **Applause**

Personally I think its much better technology than pay pal, or banks or gift cards. It should be widely adopted for it being an amazing overhaul on the worlds financial system. I thought the square was amazing. Bitcoin is out of this world. Alien technology man.
@_date: 2014-09-27 07:21:39
Now this can go to @_date: 2014-10-26 06:50:39
According to my experiences you are absolutely correct.
@_date: 2014-06-14 00:01:37
FYI People mine on ghash.io because it's better than any other pool. I highly doubt they want to harm bitcoin in any way.
@_date: 2014-06-07 16:07:44
Everyone mines on ghash because it's a good fucking mining pool. If you mine bitcoin you go to ghash. It's a no brainer. Someone else needs to build a better pool. 
@_date: 2014-06-14 02:32:11
That all went over my head. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 05:32:13
I really don't give a shit about the price. It's the technology I care about, and it's revolutionary, so I keep buying it, trading it, mining it, sharing it, spending it. The technology is changing the world. So who cares about the price. If btc went to ten bucks I would just keep getting more.
@_date: 2014-06-13 00:09:58
Wait why do we need any other payment gateway besides a bitcoin wallet? We have coinbase already, multibit, blockchain, why does paypal even matter? I'm confused. 
@_date: 2015-01-02 18:32:59
Altcoins haven't found their place in the world yet. It's just not their time. So I think this conference *should* be Bitcoin only. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:55:28
This kinda makes me sick.
@_date: 2015-01-01 06:31:21
I tried. It didn't work. Difficulty is a bitch. It's like you have a bucket, and you have to fill it with water and pour the water into a bottomless pit that you are trying to fill up. Each trip you make the hole in your bucket gets bigger. Before you know it your bucket doesn't even hold water. That's what mining is like. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 09:00:41
I think I know where this is going.
@_date: 2015-07-27 06:41:35
I was mining at gash.io when it was 9 petahash. Wow.
@_date: 2015-08-29 04:29:56
God damnit California you fuck.
@_date: 2015-02-25 07:46:03
One year bitcoin user here and I am scared of making a paper wallet. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 00:34:21
Didn't an austrian bank just loose multiple billions of euros out of nowhere? No one knows what happened to it? This happens with all forms of currency, so all you nay sayers and people that think bitcoin is going to fail, please provide a better option or shut up.
