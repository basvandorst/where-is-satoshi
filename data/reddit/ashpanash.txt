Doesn't yours? If no one else has the opinion that Bitcoin is worth anything, then what's the point of Bitcoin?

You don't think they already do? They are monitoring it closely, and they know that the only people who use it are criminals and gamblers. And they only care about the criminals, because it makes it almost trivial to track their money.

Bitcoins (or any cryptocurrency) are very difficult to acquire - it takes more than your average bit of technical knowledge - and because the technological knowledge to truly store your Bitcoins in a secure manner is even harder to acquire, they tend to be easy to steal. Even the places that should have the best security - the exchanges, which are ostensibly the source of Bitcoin's value - are consistently in the news for losing coins to hackers or poor implementations.
In addition, the lack of any remittance mechanism (which is generally touted by the community as a strength) nor any legal protection for loss, means that a simple mistake or momentary lapse of concentration could (and as we've consistently seen, does) lead to even a well-informed Bitcoin user to lose some or all of their coins, without any recourse.
It may be that in the future, Bitcoin will have legal protection and mechanisms for protecting from mistakes and theft, but as of now, I think it's absurd to consider Bitcoins easy to handle.

I understand the dumb and uneducated part, but *deceitful*? Why isn't dumb and uneducated enough? Why does it have to be lying, as well?

And not a single one of them is right? Not one of them, if nothing else, has a point?
Does bitcoin need to fight *the world*?  That's a battle it will lose.

Do what you want. It's a free internet, not (thankfully) a legal trial. Rate me as you will.

If that's the way you want to look at it. I look at it as encouragement.

Have a downvote for your dumb post about how it was completely off-topic, and an upvote for being big enough to admit that you were wrong.

Another fucking scumbag. But he's not the one on trial.

I'm not saying that you are necessarily a creationist, but this statement is either completely wrong or worded in a very misleading way. If this is representative of their general understanding of evolution, then I probably should not be as surprised as I am that many otherwise intelligent and knowledgeable bitcoiners completely misunderstand evolution.
Evolution means change over time. That's it. Nothing about 'improvement.' 
**Biological evolution** with natural selection applies to populations, not individuals, and it has nothing do do with 'improvement' or complexity. It's the extraordinarily well-supported observation that descent with modification produces changes in allele frequency which will, over time, average to favor those organisms that are more fit to survive and thrive in their environmentally selected pressure. What qualifies as 'more fit' is not by any necessity strength or intelligence or complexity or anything other than *that which is more successful at surviving and reproducing in the current environment in which the organism finds itself*.
"Improvement" is a subjective term, and has nothing to do with how evolution actually works.
