Indeed. Just read of news today about a man who is being sued by a bank because he made a joke about getting 12 billion in his bank account. 
- Last month, the Bank of the Philippine Islands encountered a computer glitch wherein customer's accounts showed erroneous details. Many people were not able to transact for a significant period of time - causing them to lose productivity, causing some to not be able to buy medicines, food, etc. 
- Many customers, made light of the moment and posted on social media. One posted that his account was credited with 12 billion pesos. It was faked, and was picked up by local subsidiary of CNN and published online  
- yet similar and real stories of such happening trended on twitter - a mixture of memes, satire and humor.
- Today July 12, 2017, the Bank of the Philippine Islands together with the National Bureau of Investigation sued the jokester alleging cyber libel. 
Let's see what's wrong over here. Bank system glitches, becomes an International joke memefied, while causing disruption to lives of many customers who are unable to transact. No class action suit against bank. Bank sues jokester. 
Fuck banks. Long live Bitcoin.
