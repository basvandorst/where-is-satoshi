If you think the BTC price will go down, go with BTC-USD. The exchange rate is locked in when you deposit your money (or so the website says, I have not confirmed myself) so you will make the dollar amount based on the high price even if the BTC price drops. If you expect bitcoin to go up, you'd want BTC-BTC, since you'll now have more bitcoin from the investment, and it'll all be worth more $.
I invested LTC-LTC, since I expected the litecoin price to rise (and I was very right so far). As long as the price stays up by the end of my 6 weeks I'll be very happy.
Here's my referral link if you're interested:

My investments with Bitpetite have been great so far. My first deposit was from Aug. 26th, and finished paying out last week (6 weeks). I have another deposit that is ending tomorrow. Both were LTC investments, and paid out the amount they said and without any problems. I have a few other small deposits as well that are chugging along fine, and I haven't had any issues withdrawing BTC or LTC. I have been doing withdrawals every 2 or 3 days and they hit my wallet almost instantly every time.
Overall I'm up about $500 on $1300 invested after 7 weeks, but that does include a little bit of referrals. My referral link is posted up the thread a bit if you're interested.

They don't "invest" the coins, they serve as a tumbler. If you want to make an anonymous transfer, you use their service so that instead of 1 transfer between 2 addresses, it becomes tons of small transfers between tons of addresses. The money ends up where you wanted it, but it didn't come "from you", so it can't be easily traced. They charge a fee for the service, but they need tons of coins and transfers for it to work, so they pay the investors for use of their coins.
