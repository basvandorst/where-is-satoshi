I'm pretty sure you can buy hashing power on NiceHash.

The details from the investigation point towards a lose of an investment in NiceHash, but this article isn't 100% definitive.

It took my a few weeks, now especially with all of the new users and other stuff happening it might take over a month. Don't panic, I know it sucks.

Coinbase and a few chinese exchanges IIRC. Don't take my word for anything.

Some have said they'll support both BTC and BTU, but the ones I'm concerned with have said they will follow majority hashing power.

Exchanges will stick with the most hashing power, as they've said.

This is a very old vulnerability that was related to a very specific VoiP problem and has no relation here. Did you just google "2FA hacking"? OP's problem is not saving their recovery code, this has nothing to do with 2FA vulnerabilities.


Since some VoIP services allow the hijacking of SMS messages, hackers could still gain access to your accounts protected with SMS-based two-factor authentication.

"End of SMS-based 2FA", are you being intentionally stupid?

You're being hyperbolic about his coins being lost. His coins aren't lost. I've been through this process and it just takes time. It's better to have your funds frozen than stolen. Responding about old security flaws is irrelevant.
