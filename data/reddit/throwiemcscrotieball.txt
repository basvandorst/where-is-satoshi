For most modes of the pi you have an Ethernet port.

Misleading. The 21 computer is based upon the pi 2, where this is similar to the pi 1. No onboard networking. Read the specs next time.

Normal operations would encounter problems. You're correct, unlike most people ITT

I agree, its unlikely that it was on their mind. This version of their product can't do the same things as the Pi2, ergo isn't in anyway comparable to the 21inc kit, despite what the idiots ITT think.

Nope, the 21 computer is based upon the Pi2, like most pis it has hardwired ethernet. The PI2 also has double the RAM, 4 64bit cores vs 1 32bit core here.

Quote me where I defend them. I pointed out factual mistakes in the post, about 2 versions of the pi. I made no mention of 21. Try reading what I wrote.

I am sure. It isn't. You're correct. The pi zero can't compare to the pi2 used by 21. It's useless as a full node, simply not powerful enough. It has no miner chip. It has no onboard networking, etc etc
@_date: 2015-11-26 13:14:48
Yeah, these idiots thinking you can run a full node on such a low power device in terms of RAM and CPU speed.

Bitcoin is for everyone, mining is not
@_date: 2015-11-26 15:25:40
They haven't proven anything. The zero can't do what the pi2, used by 21, can. It can't even run a full node. They have no idea what they're talking about. Same as most others ITT.

Whoa there shitstain.
