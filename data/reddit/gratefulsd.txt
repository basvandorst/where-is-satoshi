i'm somewhat of a noob ... but serious question for you , from a "rube" :) 
the BTC-ATM that i use , has fees as low as 5% and as high as 9% --- i don't really see the issue there ?
are there easier ways to buy with less fees ?
i'm not a fan of meeting some overweight , random pedo type looking fellow in the local walmart parking lot and handing him over cash -- doing that two times , was two times too many , and the "fee" was just as high as the BTCATM i use 
yeah , i could link my bank account and do it through coinbase or whatever , but that's not an option at the moment for me due to my identity getting stolen a year or so back .... (i have no bank account or "real" credit cards at the moment)
any guidance would be appreciated and welcomed :)
when i get my bank account back -- what would you recommend buying BTC through ?
thanks for any info :)
(and i use coinatmradar or whatever it's called ... some atms around town are 20% .. most are 10-15 , and the one i frequent is a median of 8.23% ... once it was 4.9%) 
peace and thanks :)

also , for anyone interested in BTC-ATM's ... go to the ones in "bad parts" of town ... as those fees are WAY less than the ones in more upper class neighborhoods
plus when you leave , you'll always have a funny story to tell your friends 
like last time --- i helped a homeless guy cash out BTC he received while pan handling ... he walked out with over $400 ------  one wallet address was from 2014 ...  
smart guy ... he was told it was as good as cash , and he treated that piece of paper like a god :)
he also bought my girl and I a bottle of red wine -- so props to him once again :)

Phew ... thought it was me ... thanks for making this thread, and also to the users who have replied ---- i actually have never had wallet issues with blockchain, apparently I'm one of the lucky ones -- hope this is fixed soon --- i was at a store with like $200 worth of stuff to buy :( .. ended up using an ATM and paying cash :(
