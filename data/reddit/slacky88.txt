exactly why I ditched them, and why this story actually turned out to be a good one :)

I actually did some further digging and searched that address in google and found the electrum server's donation address. I have emailed them. I don't expect anything mate, its not your address so its not your concern. But if it turns out to be someone who doesn't need that kind of donation and I can provide proof to them, there may just be a chance of getting some of it back. It doesn't hurt to ask.
Also I didn't remove the post. It must have been the admins.
If I was going to think of a story I wouldn't say that I was a gambling addict, I don't exactly deserve to get it back by admitting that, which is why I don't expect anything.
Also bitdice have the chat transcripts of that night and talking about making the accident which I have emailed to me from talking to the owner and I would be also able to get proof of the address I'm sure with a bit more work. This is no joke.
I think the address that sent to it must have been a withdrawal address from the site's hot wallet in which I would also need to contact the owner to chase up.

Thanks man, appreciate it. My own stupid fault though, I have accepted its all gone and doesn't get me that down anymore. Just today iv been going through all my wallets, accounts and emails from the last few years and finding little pieces of bitcoin around, scrounged up about $500 haha

Haha yep, I'm confident if I make good decisions here on out all that mess will be behind me, its still early days for crypto and I'm glad to be back into it.

No I don't want it all back at all. Only if the person sees it and it is small change to that particular person that received it then even a even $100 of it would help. Iv come to terms with losing 200btc, so I dont expect anything.
But theres no harm throwing it out there and explaining what all happened and I think if I was to leave out the fact I was a gambling addict then that would be just wrong. If I just said I accidentally sent 3 bitcoin a few years ago and that is all I had with no context this might have gotten upvoted, I didn't want that happening because its my own stupid fault.

How does it seem like a scam? Im specifically calling out for one single person that iv donated to in which I would then try to provide some proof. Like I said man I don't expect anything, maybe I just needed to get this shit off my chest as well. Iv already come to terms with losing 200 btc, if I don't get any of the 3 back I really don't care, I am just throwing it out there in case this one person sees it and it isn't much to them. If it is a lot to them, I don't want it back at all, they deserve it.
