Bitcoin came out after the 08 crisis so it is an assumption you can make but what do we know?

I do but i am using it just for reading the news and some technical analysis and some sort. Not publishing anything. People does not want to see but since december there is a bear market that goes down. My estimation for price action is at july. But who knows i am also just guessing.

@_date: 2018-05-20 07:21:33

Cloud mining is straight up bullshit in this environment. It's basically you pay them for the stuff and they mine for you they say but no. In this volatile environment you will see some made up charges on the bill (maintenance etc.) and when they want, you will make no money from it and nowhere to complaint.

The greater amount you put in, the risk climbs up. It's my point of view that even if they are legit i want my money to be liquid as it can be. And i rather keep my thousands (that i don't have atm) in the projects  i believe in. It's like "provably fair gambling sites". You know something is off but you can not find.

I live in Turkey and half of the people does not even aware how big of a problem this is. I believe in crypto for the sake of my savings because you never know we may end up like Greece and government can seize the USD/EUR savings and such. I changed all my assets to TUSD i don't need any bank i use binance. As you can understand i don't have that much money so no problem.
@_date: 2018-05-20 23:40:21
No it's not.

All cloud mining is bs.

I believe its all related to Uncle Sam's entrance to the arena through Lightning Network. And he doesn't like high price entrance so its gonna drop for a while too a believe. (6k max). Then if you have patience you might see some 25k(ish) stability.
My imagination and thoughts only. I am not a pro/insider.

Scaling was never a problem for now. Maybe in 10 years could be. Due to Moore's Law miners could've support the bigger block size. But no, they stuck at 1mb even Satoshi Nakamoto has stated that it can be bigger in due time (could be in whitepaper i vaguely remember this). There is only one explanation about the LN. Partial centralization, giving some trust to the US and Banks via some laws. Banks are gonna be the big Hubs. That how they are gonna enroll. If you are using btc for darknet it's sad news for you (monero saves the day for now), but if you are an average joe who wants some green price action its gonna be for you. But it's not the same bitcoin no.

I guess 2.5m sats would be more accurate.
