It's simply because they don't want to get into problems with the US and A :)

Statements like this are good for his own business but have roughly the same credibility as my wife.

Lol....does anybody even care what he says? I think he's definitively a smart guy BUT he is also a lunatic coin shiller which is only working for his own benefits! I couldn't care less! :)

So true :D

Well, you are absolutely right. And everybody else which is saying the opposite is completely delusional. Point.

He's a classical dictator. He puts every person which has another opinion into jail. All the smart academics and journalists - gone. Freedom of press - gone. But the nice thing here is that he cannot control the financial market. Turkish lira looses it's value and that's gonna hurt people. Probably Erdogan is foolish enough trying to take over power from the central bank of Turkey. Let's see. Nevertheless, his strategy is not sustainable in the long-term

Even if it is so....it's not his achievement! Big difference

Turkish Lira lost 20% of it's value since the beginning of the year. Why should the average Joe be willing to invest his hard-earned money into BTC? Bitcoin as well as every other crypto asset is simple not stable enough ATM for the average investor....

This has to happen. We had such crazy valuations. Shit companies without any business plan or token utility valued at 100+ million dollars. 95 % of all projects will fail. I am pretty confident about that. Where does it go? I have no idea!
@_date: 2018-11-23 12:56:11
Which one do you think? :D
@_date: 2018-11-23 11:15:15
The delusion of people here always amuses me! :)
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:31:25
Thanks a lot for taking the time!
@_date: 2017-10-16 20:35:57
You have no idea, have you? :)
@_date: 2018-07-09 19:35:21
Lol...what a delusional statement!

I am talking more about mainstream adaption which is certainly not the case at the moment. As long as the price of Bitcoin doubles every x-months, people are not willing to spend it but rather prefer to keep it. I am sure most people which own Bitcoin see it exactly the same way and that's why I think it will never find mainstream adaption as a currency. Don't get me wrong - I fully support Bitcoin and think it has a great future ahead...

I would say that too if I would be a Bitcoin-whale...!
