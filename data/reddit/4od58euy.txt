Bitcoin is designed to stabilize fiat currency.  
No one will use fake fiat currency with huge taxes and inflation.

I am not ignorant asshole.
Jews problems should be resolved in Israel.
Jews problems can not justify their theft in Poland.
I am not racist.
If Poles will have a problem in the future in Poland will they be able to steal taxes on Americans in New York or other city in USA?
Do not insult me in the future, just use arguments, because you show your primitives.

We have a lot of space to save transactions without fees.  
Demand is lower than maximum capacity of litecoin.  
Rules was changed and it is not fair.  
Litcoin does not inspire confidence.  
So why litecoin changed rules?

Historic rules for free transactions  
A transaction was safe to send without fees if these conditions were met:  
It is smaller than 1,000 bytes.  
All outputs are 0.01 BTC or larger.  
Its priority is large enough (see above)  
So we have changing rules during the game!

Many people in Poland also don't know anything about jews in Poland.
Many people in Poland think that governemnt in Poland is polish, but governemnt is jewish.
Maybe in Argentina is the same situation like in Poland.
In Poland we know that jews buy Patagonia from Argentina and Chile.
So try to learn about jews in Argentina.
