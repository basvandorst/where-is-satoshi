something should also be done about  twitter account. it is the first thing that we see when we google bitcoin and its total BTC FUD &amp; BCH promotion.

my thoughts exactly no more centralization in china. Isn't that good?
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:44:39
but how exactly was he able to trick them?

I am a bit confused about the lightning network. Wont there need to be and initial on-chain payment in order to open a payment channel for off-chain transactions? If thats the case wont block size still be an issue and won't spam transactions keep the bitcoin network very slow. doesn't it make more sense to have both the lightning network and a slight block size increase say to 2 or 4 mb. do people believe the lightning network will work even if every on-chain transaction still cost 30 dollars? Do you expect us to open lightning payment channels that cost 30 dollars each? 
@_date: 2018-09-13 04:00:00
meaning it could be one person responsible?

BCH is a tool of bitcoin core. Bitcoin core are using BCH to demonize minor increases in block size when it would help during bitcoin rallies like we had in December 2017.
@_date: 2018-05-11 05:48:22
that is not the only thing that could happen. say we have a huge bust and boom down to 2000 then up to 20,000. I would want a 2 mb block size for that.
@_date: 2018-05-07 18:27:28
it should have been an opendime. 
@_date: 2018-05-04 18:38:43
with more and more adoption we will hear more bitcoin travel stories to come!
@_date: 2018-05-06 04:30:20
that is alot smaller than an increase to 2 mbs especially at adoption percentage in the low thirties. 1.2mb blocks are still low. Segwit is a great supplement but an increase in block size to 2mb is needed to meet the demand of last december 2017. If you don't think bitcoin is going to the moon anytime then it makes sense not to increase the block size. However i think there will be more bitcoin hype and fomo and it only makes sense to increase the blocksize  to 2 mb to prepare for it. Let's try to get off this war with bch and be rational. just because roger ver is irresponsibly increasing blocksize of bch doesn't mean the idea has no merit. we need to step away from all the naritives and be resonable.

even right now the memepool is overloaded its not getting better.
@_date: 2018-05-10 19:54:34
if we experience volume like last december then you will wish it had increased to 2 mb
@_date: 2018-06-09 21:30:18
what about litecoin and monero?
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:28:42
Who will you pay with the lightning network? the answer is nobody. 
@_date: 2018-06-02 06:10:49
slow to the point of uselessness 
@_date: 2018-06-07 06:22:31
it still will be ineffectual if the base layer gets completely filled. thats why maybe a block size increase to 2 mb is a good idea
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:36:20
i know the block size needs an increase but people involved in the project have become irrational zealots or they are actively trying to mislead. same with the moderator on r/bitcoin. They delete posts that have to do with increasing block size 
@_date: 2018-06-28 05:34:26
its crazy fanaticism that is keeping a block size increase from happening. 
@_date: 2018-06-28 20:17:02
users don't have a vote, miners do. wasn't it that 2x didn't go through because it changed other things as well, not just the blocksize?
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:54:10
more like penny
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:33:54
not if you want your transaction to go through in a timely fashion. You could be waiting 600 minutes or more for it to go through.
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:40:31
but how long did it take to verify half a day?
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:31:41
right now on bitcoinfees.earn it shows that if you want a transaction to go through in the next 30 minutes you need to pay 160 sat/byte
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:38:35
Lightning has great application for micro payments but do you think it can really replace on chain transactions?
@_date: 2019-04-06 19:41:21
so your saying this site is misinformation? 
@_date: 2018-03-24 16:40:43
there is always an end that is what it is to be human
@_date: 2018-03-10 08:37:52
fees are up is this a spam attack?
@_date: 2018-03-23 22:24:50
1969 for lightning network, does that mean it will be functional in 30 years?
@_date: 2018-02-28 07:02:55
what an billion dollar idiot to have blamed cryptocurrency and not the drug distributors, manufacturers, clinics and pharmacies. How is fentanyl getting on the streets without their help or negligence.
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:25:11

@_date: 2018-02-02 13:01:08
crazy whale movements! I see most of you are banking that these are the friendly type of whales that want bitcoin to ultimately  succeed.

the only thing is that when i open my robinhood app it tells me that it suspects my samourai app of phishing.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:52:19
I was thinking that in the future new bitcoin code might allow for someone to create an address that created multiple addresses automatically and the user would not have to go though the trouble of making those addresses. This would make donation addresses especially on posters and paper or tip coasters or whatever alot easier to manage and also be more secure if pricacy could somehow be maintained and it would not possible to access the account ballance information of the entire account.
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:44:44
yes that is what i meant.
@_date: 2018-07-12 04:53:58
we need to take the  middle way. Increase block size enough to increase transactions but not enough to worsen decentralization a 2mb block would be a good thing.
@_date: 2018-07-30 22:49:44
Isn't there a ban in India?
@_date: 2018-02-27 23:42:02
yes maybe there will be a more private option for this if bitcoin starts adopting more privacy features.
@_date: 2018-02-16 17:17:35
How does litecoin decentralization compare to bitcoin decentralization? from what i understand litecoin is easier to mine than bitcoin and thus more independent miners can mine more profitably with litecoin than with bitcoin. Does this make litecoin mining more decentralized? Not trying to shill litecoin here, just want to learn more about mining and thought it might be a good example for comparison on decentralization. 
@_date: 2018-07-13 04:17:32


@_date: 2018-07-13 06:18:58
segwit is part of the middle way. a small increase in blocksize is also part of the middle way.

he also said " the reports of my death has been greatly exaggerated." 
@_date: 2018-04-09 05:33:00
at some point in the future we will need to increase the block size why not now?
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:31:12
this is why have been say that doubling the block size is a smart move if it will help deal with spam like this
@_date: 2018-04-09 05:31:27
is anyone worried that there are so few bitcoin transactions compared to the last part of 2017?
