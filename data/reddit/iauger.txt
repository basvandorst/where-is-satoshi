When can we expect these fees to drop down to a reasonable level?

I’m not 100% sure what you mean by “decentralized nature”.
Can you please expand on what you mean?
For me, when I purchased in 2013 or 14, I was intrigued by the idea that we have a new, novel method of paying for goods and services that was relatively secure, more convenient than cash, free (at the time) or at least really inexpensive, and fairly anonymous to use. And I wouldn’t have to use banks anymore! I thought it would be great for day to day use, and I also thought it would be great for moving larger sums of money without having to use banks. The low cost, relative anonymity, and did I mention I wouldn’t have to use banks any more, are what excited me the most. Yes, there was also the speculative side. I did think it was going to increase in value, but I wasn’t prepared to bet the farm.
 
For me, the transaction costs have to be lower than anything it competes with or else what is the point?
As for the speed. That is important for some transactions but not all. A bank transfer, I can afford to wait an hour or more. Buying groceries, that has to be instant.

What to the abreveations in your replay mean?  CPFP and RBF? 
Also how do you resend a wallet?
Thank you

Any wild guess as to the timeline?
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:08:33
Is there documentation somewhere to back this up?

Why didn’t you use Core Coin?  oh, right . the $30 surcharge..

Why are small transactions called Spam?  All transactions are important for the technology to succeed.  Visa doesn’t call buying a coffee Spam.

I have approximately $200 in one of my wallets. This particular wallet has a lot of very small transactions that funded it. Because of the high byte-size of the wallet I can’t even access it because the fee. 
 In other words, the transaction cost is higher than the balance in the wallet.
I believe that the general term for something like this is “Dust”. Now right now it is only $200. What happens when BTC goes “TO THE MOON”? say it hits $100,000 or $200,000. if everything stays the same my $200 is worth a whopping $2000 and is still Dust because the transaction fee will still be higher than the wallet balance. This is in no way acceptable for a currency.
Can you imagine how quickly Visa or M/C would lose customers if they charged this much for a transaction. 
Right now all this is good for is super wealthy people.  Obviously the miners like the current situation. 
I get it though, the miners have a lot of money invested trying to stay at the forefront of the technology. They need to pay their bills.
Ok, the new argument it that it is a “store of value”.
I don’t understand how there is any value in BTC when you can’t really use it for anything. It’s not like gold, because gold is valuable as a physical item and has uses outside of monetary value. It isn’t fiat, so it isn’t backed by a government or gold (OK, we all really know that that is a bit of a farce, but is is important to some people.) 
The only value is in the perception. (Perception is reality! Until it isn’t)
To make it really valuable, it has to be useable. 
To be usable it needs to have very low fees or no fees.

So you are basically making this up. A link or it doesn’t exist.  You made the claim, you back it up.
@_date: 2018-01-06 04:08:52
That is the 64,000 BTC Queston. Unless tested we will never know for sure, will we?
 I thought that miners get paid by mining coin.

Do the USD amounts make a difference? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:40:41


 SegWit and Lightning both change the fundamentals of BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-28 03:20:22
Lightning and SegWit both remove the transactions from the blockchain. That is a fundamental  difference from what Bitcoin is all about.
I suppose that it is also bullshit that I can’t transfer $200 USD with of BTC out of my Blockchain account because the transaction fee and the Mining fee are more than the wallet is worth.

The  whole appeal of bitcoin was the zero or minimal transaction fee to allow small transactions. Suddenly now not paying a fee is a spam transaction? None of this makes sense.  As it is right now BTC is pure speculation, a moneygrab (Tax) for the miners to collect, and the Banking (transaction fees) charged by the exchanges amount to another money grab.
