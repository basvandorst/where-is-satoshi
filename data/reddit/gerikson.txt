Bitcoin's deflationary nature is often held as one of its best features. There will only be a fixed number of bitcoins in existance.
Let's say that the economy continues to expand, but the money supply does not. This means that prices for goods and services will fall over time. This also means that wages - the cost of an employer paying an employee for their labour - will also fall.
So if you take out a loan denominated in Bitcoin, not only will you get less and less BTC for your labour in the future, but the interest will go in the other direction - the loan will get more expensive as time goes on and it will be harder and harder to repay.
This of course is the same for the employer who wishes to expand his business - loans will get more and more expensive, while the price he can demand for his product will fall. 
This is why deflation is considered worse than inflation - credit becomes very expensive.

Different jurisdictions, and different alleged crimes.
DPR's coins were involved in selling drugs.
The MtGox coins, if they were stolen, were ... stolen :) Nothing for law enforcement to auction off.
The first batch of SR coins was coins that were part of the marketplace. Owners of those coins had a chance to tell LE that they were their property. Obviously as the vast majority were earmarked for purchase or selling of proscribed substances, most people just wrote them off. 
(There was a dude in the UK who tried to get them back, but his claim was denied).
Bottom line: they weren't DPR's coins.
I'm not sure about the ones being auctioned off in a few days. They're not the entire stash that Ulbricht claimed from the beginning of this case.

Define "stable". How are you going to measure that?
As mentioned elsewhere, for now CHF is effectively pegged to the Euro.
You'll have to define a basket of goods, but any such basket will contain energy, which is essentially oil, which is denominated in USD.
Let's say you define a consumer good, such as a mid-size sedan car. The steel will come from Sweden, the IP from Germany or Japan, the manufacturing may be in the US... all currencies are entwined. 
A falling dollar will help American goods and services become cheaper in the world market, thereby helping the American economy. However, if you're a consumer in the US, you may be relatively worse off if the goods you buy are not from the US.

Bitcoin beliefs shades into both. You have the eschatological predictions of Bitcoin taking over the world, ending wars and debt forever... these are themes religions have dealt with for a long time. 
As for politics, the idea of "sound money" is inherently political. It cuts to the center of how one believes societies should be ordered. You're hard-pressed to find a left-wing adherent of Bitcoin (counter-examples are welcome). 
In the end, it doesn't matter if Bitcoin is "formally" a religion, or "officially" a political movement. Similar passions are in play, similar claims are made. So it's not hard to believe a "counter-sub" has arisen to give voice to those who disagree. 
Another example: are there subs opposing and criticizing MLM schemes etc?

His cover story is that the coins were drained via transaction malleability. Then he found 200K coins.

I worked as a cashier in a Swedish bank during the 90s. Cashier checks were regularly used for high-priced items such as cars. 
Using a check that's in your name, that you sign over to the seller when you're happy with the purchase, is generally safer than handing over cash. 
If someone presented a cashier's check from another bank we'd call them and get it verified. It was not unusual for both the buyer and the seller to present the check together.

So you mean that after having the chance for 90 days to contact the authorities and claim their coins, they'll wait until they're bought by one or more 3rd parties, and then somehow demand those coins back? 
Silk Road held those coins in escrow. That's the reason there was a giant wallet with 30K coins. Even if someone would try to get their coins back, which party do they contact? 
This is the ultimate fence. The US Federal government has declared that these coins are the fruits of a criminal enterprise, and will be liquidated to compensate the victim - in this case the same government (maybe states will share). You can be sure that any attempts to claim those coins have no legal standing whatsoever.

I am not a lawyer, so I don't know if there are clauses in the process to declare these coins forfeit that will protect buyers of them from claims from the original owners. However, I do think that the 90 days notice to claim that specific coins were seized in error covers that. Someone more versed in asset forfeiture law will have to correct me.
When it comes to &lt;color&gt;listing those coins, I don't really see how this would work in practice. As a depositor of coins to SR, you have access to your wallet's private key, and can presumably prove that you deposited X coins on date Y into the wallet that was later seized.
Now that wallet has been moved to a new one (happened a few days ago), and they will be split into several lots. The trail is cold, so to speak. How do you trace your X coins to the new lots?

Most banks in Sweden have such restrictions and have had them for years. A lot of branches don't deal with cash at all.
Cash is expensive to handle and a significant security risk. The handling of cash for ATMs is outsourced to 3rd parties that empty them independent of the hosting bank branch.
Banks will of course offer cashiers checks for those who need to transport large amounts of money and who don't wish for their bank to arrange an electronic transfer.

The USD will fall in value relative to other currencies, sure. This will however help US exports by making US goods cheaper on the world market. 
The USD is not a de jure reserve currency. It has that status by the fact that the US economy is the largest in the world, the US Federal Reserve has a sterling reputation, and large parts of the world's energy reserves are priced in USD. The loss of reserve currency status will be gradual, not overnight.

Banks make money in the interest rate difference from the money they borrow from consumers and the money they lend out.

Silk Road is considered by the US authorities to be an illegal enterprise. They'd be very interested in talking to anyone foolish enough to attach their name and whereabouts to a legal claim concerning Silk Road's assets.
You use loaded terms like "stolen" and "theft" in this case. Legally, they were seized as part of a criminal investigation and are being sold after no-one has made a claim that they were *not* used illegally. You may disagree with the morality of the actions of law enforcement in this case but they are legally in the right of it.
By tracking each and every bitcoin and attaching a "taint" to it with regards to whether it's been stolen or not, you raise a host of issues that I don't know if you've thought through:
1. Bitcoins are no longer fungible. Some are tainted and can be returned to their "rightful owner" at any time. This defeats part of Bitcoin's use as a medium of exchange, thus lowering its value.
2. The "public list" of wrongfully acquired bitcoins will have to be maintained, and disputes handled. One person's "theft" is another's sincere attempt to start a business using those coins, which failed, resulting in bankruptcy. You need to have some sort of way to ascertain that a theft or fraud really has occurred. The most convenient way to do this is by using the current legal system, but by the time something has been determined there the original coins may have been transacted many times over. Not to mention tumblers, which can be equally used to obfuscate bitcoin transactions from the fiscal authorities and to "launder" stolen coins.
3. There's no legal way to enforce the use of the list for all merchants. Say I want to buy an item from two merchants, Honest Dealer who follows the list, and Shady Sam who doesn't. Honest Dealer will have higher prices to deal with the overhead of following the list, and the risk for me as a buyer is higher, as I am not certain my offered coins will not be returned to a distant 3rd party during the sale. Shady Sam is unconcerned with the list and will offer me goods at presumably lower price and risk to me.

Banking is a mature market with relatively low margins.
To make money running a consumer bank you need tons of customers, physical offices, a pile of cash as reserves, and regulatory know-how. Plus a lot of marketing to get those customers.

Thanks for this information, I guess I'm still in a 2010-2011 mindset. Personally I don't have any debt so I have had the luxury of ignoring interest rates etc. 
In any case, if households have lower debt ratios then presumably there's more money around to pay for goods and services. This leads to a better economic outlook, better revenue, less need to borrow money from the government, and hence lower risk for inflation (at least as a quick way to get rid of public debt).

Right now Bitcoin is inflationary - 3,600 new coins "minted" every day.
I haven't run the numbers but I'd think it would be around a decade before the yearly BTC inflation falls to the (historically low, granted) current inflation of the USD or EUR. 
Sure Bitcoin is deflationary in the long term but that long term is in the order of a 30-year mortgage - again, speaking off the top of my head. Numbers welcome!

Could be, but I think most activity on exchanges are off-chain, i.e. a blockchain transaction only occurs when traders move coins in and out of the exchange.
Of course the exchange may be moving coins between hot and cold wallets too... but rationally they'd move lots of coins in each to minimize the cost of fees.
Disclaimer: I don't know how any exchanges are set up internally. I hope they don't do it like Mt Gox.

What's the power consumption of an Antminer S3? 
According to  it's 366 watts.
That's around the power consumption of a washing machine: 
Running it 24/7 will equal (366 * 24 / 1000) kWh * 365 ~= 3,200 kWh annually. 
According to  the average electrical energy consumption of a US household is 10,837 kWh. So you'll increase your energy bill by 1/3 for a year.

A lot more people hold gold in the form of jewelry, watches etc. as a "last ditch" defense against ruin. No pawn shop worth its name will turn down a genuine gold Rolex. A paper wallet? Not so much.

Thanks for summarizing the standard talking points for merchants to accept bitcoin.
In this case I was replying to a suggestion for Steam to directly convert to fiat via for example Coinbase.

2. I'll grant that if you use Coinbase
3. Doubt this is a problem for Steam. Coinbase is a single point of failure though. Even if the money doesn't disappear it's a 3rd party risk.
4. Irrelevant as they're converting to fiat directly.
5. Also irrelevant in this case.

I strongly disagree, the most vocal posters are obsessed with "core" and "shills" and "destroying the legacy chain".

*Edit* I did a sanity check in Excel to confirm my Perl code and it's correct: 
*Edit edit* Some back of the envelope math:
* if BTC price were to reach USD 10,000 in 90 days, that would mean an average of (10000-4400)/90 = USD 62.2 per day rise.
* If that rate were to be drawn back into the past, it would have taken BTC (4400/62.2)=70.7 days to go from 0 to 4400. This is not consistent with the published price data.

BCH price is relatively steady, I don't see any recent evidence of price decrease. 
*Edit* more relevantly, the BCH/BTC pair has been relatively steady at around 0.15 since the first period of BCH profitability. That rose happened on the weekend, must have been a lot of eager traders.
Not sure where OP got 5 EDA adjustments from, there was only one before the latest dip in BCH difficulty

My point is not that people aren't allowed to sue, it's that the chance of getting a settlement from Bitfinex through the courts is remote.
These are 2 different jurisdictions. I don't know where Bitfinex is registered, but you can bet it'll be a hard time for US citizens to bring a class action suit against an entity that's not registered with the SEC.

That chart is among the worst I've seen...
If you were to take 2 circles, one denoting BTC with a "market cap" of 41B, and another with the largest circle of "all money" at 83.6T, and scaled the radius of the first to unity, the radius of the second would be 45. 
I don't have a graphics app handy that can count the pixels in that image but there's no way the circles are scaled correctly.
OP, maybe use that as an inspiration, but double check the numbers and re-do the graphics correctly.

I believe "real" stock companies do some research with exchanges before choosing a symbol, but in this case I think the team either didn't know or care that, like it or not, Coinmarketcap is a big source of info, Bitconnect Coin already had the BCC symbol.

I think at this kind of macro level using the aggregate value (number of tokens times last price) is ok. Maybe do a weighted average over a year to get some sort of "normalized" number.
For example, a year ago today the aggregated value was 9.1B, at pixel time today it's  46.5B.

Because using a blockchain to "synchronize" different internal ledgers could conceivably be faster and/or cheaper than the settlement system as it exists now.
Consider different brokerages. They hold share certificates in trust from their customers. Customer at broker A sells X shares to customer at broker B. Somehow this info needs to be transferred between the brokers so there's no "double-spend" of certificates.
A blockchain could help all the brokers achieve consensus faster on who at what broker owns what shares.

Not directly, but regular audits are required and minimum cash reserves are enforced through regulation.

Plenty of innocent people have been arrested and have posted bail awaiting trial, then been acquitted. Bail is separate from being convicted. 
Plenty of people get bail money by having friends or family setting up property etc. as collateral. Ofc if the defendant skips bail that money is owed.

If it were profitable to buy and run 1 ASIC, even at a timescale of say, 10 years, I'm sure people would do it.
However, you're competing for 25 BTC every ten minutes with every other miner in the world. Even if you 1 machine can find a block with the same probability as any other, it stands to reason that the guy with 1,000 miners has a better chance of finding that block and getting at least some money back.
The "arms race" is fundamental to the security of the bitcoin network. The fact that it's led to a de-facto centralization and an exclusion of the private "hobby" miner was foreseen by Satoshi.

You might want to avoid the exchanges for other reasons than being "a complete idiot". Off the top of my head, the following things come to mind:
1. doubts that exchanges can provide the fiat liquidity you require
2. you don't want to reveal your payment details to an untrusted third party (the exchange), and any law-enforcement requests for that same information
3. the exchanges may be front-running your orders 
4. You might want to get payment in kind, i.e. the buyer will finance your power bill, new hardware etc, maybe through shell companies
5. Your operation relies on cash and your buyer will happily deliver attache cases full of it.

You can't directly compare a unit of currency with a share of a company.

No shit. 
This was blindingly obvious at the time. 
@_date: 2015-10-25 20:35:06
Companies don't issue 25 new shares every 10 minutes. 
Bitcoin is a currency, not a share of a company.
"Market cap" really makes no sense for bitcoin, "aggregated value" is a better term. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 07:33:44
Reading the indictment, the US authorities have known about this since Jan 2017
@_date: 2015-02-23 06:30:52
You mean inflation slows down with the new halving. As long as bitcoins are being mined there's an increase in monetary supply.

Like during Silk Road, if you can prove you left your money there in good faith you can probably make a case for getting it back. But it really depends on how those coins are treated as in relation to BTC-E. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 07:53:08
It's not as if there's a central authority for these things. Coinmarketcap uses BCC for BitConnect but Coinbase can call it whatever they want.
@_date: 2016-07-08 11:58:19
Probably a shorter.

Actually no, it's the current price multiplied by all bitcoins mined.
Satoshi paid nothing for all the coins he mined (apart from computer hardware and electricity, but the difficulty was negligible then compared to now).
@_date: 2016-07-04 12:47:42
Indeed. The sentence states he was convicted of running SR, not of any murder.

Read the indictment, it's spelled out there.They did substantial business in the US but did not adhere to FinCen/KYC/AML etc.
@_date: 2018-12-28 22:20:46
Yeah so why would they push AML laws and then break them? 
AML/KYC is an additional cost of doing business for banks. There’s no way they’d inflict that on themselves. It’s a state thing.

I dunno, I'd use __mining hardware__ to mine Bitcoin instead of a fucking dam full of water.

With the current price of 223 and an estimated 13.87 million coins issued, Bitcoin's aggregated value is around $3.10 billion.
One percent of that is $31 million. Not saying this is pocket change but it won't bankrupt a country.

@_date: 2017-06-16 16:29:42
Well, the point of my scheme, which took me literally one minute to dream up, was to avoid exchanges as much as possible. If you have something north of 16 BTC you can arrange an OTC transaction easily. 
But please continue to build a straw man, it's very constructive. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:36:42
That’s paranoid bullshit. 
Why would any bank deliberately say no to customers?
It’s all about the state protecting its tax revenue.

For the last couple of months the price usually spikes over the weekend. Speculation is its Chinese exchanges improving their spread/take/whatever around futures settlements.

Here's one way that this could have been set up: 
1. create a collection page entirely under their control - reputable figures within the BTC community can vouch for it, using public key sigs
2. publish the collection address - maybe with a snazzy interface showing totals and incoming donations
3. at the end of a set period, sell these coins on an exchange (using an escrow entity) or offer them for public auction - it's for a good cause after all.
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:13:30
Why are they going via Coinbase? Just set up an address and publish that!
@_date: 2016-07-01 09:19:43

AML/KYC are *laws* made by states, and enforced globally. Banks are afraid to lose their licenses so they proactively enforce these laws in relation to 3rd parties - exchanges. 
If banks were in charge they'd grab that sweet money-laundering business themselves.

What's the slope on the log line? I'm running LMS on the BTCaverage pricedata and right now it's 0.33%/day, which translates to a "predicted" price of 4.7K USD, i.e. twice what we're seeing right now.
