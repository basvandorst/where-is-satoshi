So how do they make any changes to bitcoin if they have to get all the miners on board?
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:47:43
Yes, or wait till they have bill payments added to their system. But who wants to wait to get into bitcoin!

Thanks for the suggestion. I have added a ticket but they need to get a customer service team if they are going to post a 888 number

Have you been verified? If so, you go to Deposit &amp; Withdraw and you will see that "We currently support certified checks and wire transfers. Bill payments will be available shortly. All funds are in US Dollars - Canadian Dollars will be accepted shortly." So you can send them a cheque or wire them the funds.
