I have never been able to get away with $0 exchange fees/rates. Please tell me what you do so I can do that now as well...
1. You can buy things with Bitcoin straight at select places (the same way you could only buy things with US dollars in select locations in the early years/only certain banks took certain 'currencies' issued by other banks) 2. Give it more time. It will eventually get to the point that you will not need to transfer or exchange it to another currency.
 
I don't really believe Bitcoin is the answer. Others like Litecoin or Ripple would be in your wallet within minutes. That is today. In the future, that could be in moments not minutes. 
The difference between you and I is simple. I'm willing to take the risk, gamble and see if I can get further on a new road. You seem to want to walk the safe road every where you go. Nothing wrong with either route, I will win and lose. You will win and lose.

Let's not even discuss counterfeiting, inflation and government manipulation....
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:40:07
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:09:05
Sure about that? Haha. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:15:26
Actually not true, yet again. I sold out of my bitcoin and had it in my bank account within 48 hours, no issues. Bitcoin isn't actually tied to the dollar,  if the dollar crashed then I could convert bitcoin into the pound or Euro as well. Eventually,  bitcoin won't be tied to any fiat bullshit money and will hold its own value. A dollar is worth a dollar because over time it has stabilized itself to this point. I buy crypto because I don't want to be tied to a government backed currency. I don't want to go to Europe and pay tons in exchange fees to convert over to Euro to make a purchase. Crypto could very well become an international currency used anywhere with no fees or exchange rates. Sure, illegal shit happens with bitcoin. I buy illegal drugs every week with fiat dollars. Explain to me the difference?
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:57:09
Haha so wait. Did you really just ignore that entire section where I say I don't think bitcoin is the answer? Did that not fit your narrative or something?
Also, I will now have to start a new bank/credit cards to do that...entire new ball game just to get free exchange rates...
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:41:41
I have a visa debit card connected to my bitcoin account. I bought a milkshake the other day, no problem, and you say I will starve to death?
@_date: 2017-12-25 07:37:18
Hold Up. The central bank is a good thing!? We don't print endlessly? Have we ever stopped, I'm confused? You don't even realize that we borrow money to pay for our budget? You do realize that majority of the money we 'borrow' is actually just being borrowed from ourselves. (Which means we print more money to cover the amount we are borrowing from ourselves haha) If this doesn't make sense to you, then go look it up and dive deeper into the mess that is our federal reserve...The Federal Reserve being created combined with dropping Gold behind the dollar has a direct correlation with the lead up to the Great Depression. We had never had a 'Great Depression' until the federal reserve decided to drop gold, inflate the money supply, manipulate the interest rates and then of course, FDR's stimulus package caused the entire economy to go from depression to great depression. Obviously a ton more details into this but if you try to tell me none of what I just said has anything to do with it then you really don't need to respond to this anymore. So essentially everything you told me the Central Banks are great for I'm telling they aren't great for. This wont last forever, we are just still in the early days of the Federal Reserve. Remember, over half the US's history had no federal reserve and the dollar was backed by Gold not just the government...
I don't trust a government to control inflation or deflation. I really don't trust someone controlling the supply of money and therefore an economy as a whole. The only reason why what we are doing is working is because the entire world has followed suit and is doing it too. Again, we are in uncharted territory, I don't care what "smart or smarter" people are thinking up to tell you some bullshit for why we need to print more money. Just as many smart people say this can't sustain itself. No one actually knows what will happen in the future. The same way no one knows what will happen with Crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 03:08:04
Haha, pretty much saying that investing in crypto is moronic then...and in all honesty, it might be. I guess we will find out eventually won't we...Some weeks I have more money from it, some I don't. Either way it's proving the future use of crypto and the possibilities it brings. (You simply said you couldn't pay bills with crypto and I'm simply telling you that's incorrect, how you emotionally feel about it is irrelevant)...
@_date: 2017-12-25 08:47:30
The Gold standard was actually done in 1933 just as the depression was becoming the great depression. 
Although I am sure you won't ever see eye to eye with Friedman, still a great read...
Enjoy your superior intellect. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 05:20:28
I love the idea of controlled inflation like that exists. Are you really trying to tell me inflation causes no harm and is good for the economy? I believe many countries would disagree with you on this one. Enough said there. We will simply never see eye to eye on this subject. 
The US dollar is trustworthy today. Sure. You act as if the US will last forever and never crumble, fail or fall. History tells us the exact opposite. No country lasts forever. Period. The idea of nothing backed, fiat paper money is brand new to economics and no one knows where this is going. No one. We just print money endlessly. We borrow money FROM OURSELVES! Haha. While at the same time, technology is only growing faster, stronger and will eventually completely take over our daily life making the idea of a digital currency not so crazy after all. Will it fully replace fiat or govt backed currency, I would highly doubt that. 
Counterfeiting, I agree with you. But, doesn't exist of the blockchain. My only point.
@_date: 2019-03-04 18:50:25
I don't really blame them, shit gets expensive quick.
@_date: 2019-03-04 17:09:14
They said Visa credit...not debit or prepaid cards. 
Price structure is different I’m pretty sure.
@_date: 2019-04-29 21:10:49
You think Bitcoin is capable of taking down SWIFT? What drugs are you on? I want some of that. Bitcoin is a store of value. Period. Micro-transactions will never happen on a grand scale, even with the 'upgrades' it will never beat out newer superior chains. 
XRP is not Bitcoin. You trying to put them as one is laughable. They will coexist together and both will want each other to exist in the future. I was hoping for something to change my mind but yet again I don't see it.
Hating to hate is trolling.
@_date: 2019-04-27 16:43:27
Partner banks are using xrp right now. So that's not quite right. 
You could end up right or wrong yet you speak like it's already fact. 
Was hoping for something better and more concrete than that.
@_date: 2019-04-28 02:27:48
Jed helped found mt gox, yes? Idk where you are going with this. He sold the company off in March 2011, stayed as minority owner and then later that year they had a security breach, or the first one. He wasn't running it nor had anything to do with any of it. The company didn't officially go down until 2014.
I'm confused at where you thought that meant ripple is a scam? Is he now a scam and everything he touches is a scam as well? Haha.
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:05:30
Why is mining necessary? A lot of negatives to mining that you seem to ignore? Their concesus algorithm isn't just some generic PoW...its a far better system that is safer, cheaper and better than PoW or PoS...and yes, I've read extensively into how it works, I see more benefits in the end for doing it this way.
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:03:32
Not centralized. More nodes that are part of the trusted lines than ripple themself that make up the majority. So you are wrong there.
Yes, they are building those liquidity markets/pools right now. 
Ripple absolutely has a business plan. Have you ever researched anything about them? You sound very uneducated about this topic
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:08:36
They are literally using it in corridors between Mexico and the Philippines...do you literally not read at all? This isn't hidden news man. 
Go read. This industry is changing so incredibly fast, everyday. What you see happening today is changing tomorrow. 
Except Bitcoin haha.

@_date: 2019-04-28 16:06:42
Can't believe I really watched that crap. 
2 Bitcoin guys, 1 a btc developer of course haha trying to spread as much FUD as they can by blurring the facts and lines about the ripple system. Not to mention, this is very old news. Very old. Maybe ask them to do an updated video haha? Have you not watched one of these about Bitcoin? You should.
 Jed's not even part of ripple and hasn't been for a long time. Years have gone by, nothing has ever come from it. No one seems to address that though? Everyone just says, "MT GOX!"
Ripple is not Bitcoin. They are attacking a different problem in a completely different way. You either believe in it or you don't. Banks and institutions are getting into this industry whether we like it or not, this is the best solution I see to bridging that connection and taking down SWIFT bcus Bitcoin fucking can't do it. I want real-world solutions.
Ripples only real competitor right now, stellar, which is a Jed forked system from the ripple protocol. So yeah, that I don't trust, but even he still trusts that protocol. Haha stellar seems to be doing well despite what I think.
@_date: 2019-04-27 15:24:20
How is ripple a scam?
@_date: 2019-04-28 00:01:10
Yes sir glaapp.
@_date: 2019-04-28 00:59:20
I have. That's the point.
@_date: 2019-04-27 15:47:51
Haha oh. Well I mean. Thats logic. 
Thanks man.
@_date: 2019-04-28 15:48:05
In the model of Bitcoin, sure this works. But in ripples protocol, it does the same thing but in a different way. Just has PoW is different than PoS. You are incentivised to be a trusted node and help keep the network safe. You are part of it. You rely on it. You must also put some xrp into the pie to hold an account and to be a node. More you want to do on the network, more you much put in. 
What about the electricity bill Bitcoin is racking up? The environmental concern is pretty alarming. Most of which is done in China, who seems to control the power of Bitcoin and there's a potential for a 50% attack on the network. Not possible on the ripple network. 
Think about the future of running the Bitcoin network as it grows...can we really sustain that?
@_date: 2019-04-28 00:00:01
Haha. Well, whenever I hear some updated facts and logic that prove me wrong, I'll agree all day with you.
@_date: 2019-04-27 23:06:55
? A ton of old news in here. We are long beyond this point.
Do you think technology stays static? Oh wait, you like Bitcoin, that would make sense I guess. Haha.
@_date: 2019-04-29 16:25:37
Wait. You don't trust no one in this space..but you trust Satoshi Nakamoto and Bitcoin? Bitcoins community? 
Isn't that a little contradictory?
@_date: 2019-05-07 21:15:24
Haha, I guess analogies are not your thing. Got it.
You can find whatever you want, ironic, but the US Treasury printing paper and handing it to the 'Federal' Reserve to manage, eh. The federal government sets the salaries of the board's seven governors, eh. 
The Board's seven governors are appointed by the **President of the United States** and confirmed by the **U.S. Senate**, umm.
The Federal Reserve gets its authority from the United States Congress (through legislation).
Many people in the government have referred to it as "an instrument of the US Government". Hard to find a cite for that one since it's in videos. 
Look at so many people around you, they don't even realize it's "private". They just assume it's a federal organization, I wonder why that is. . .
The Fed is crony capitalism at its finest and that to me is 'SUPER fukn cringe'.
@_date: 2019-05-07 23:24:47
Haha. Thanks for the advice, but it's piss poor.
What correlation is that exactly that is inaccurate?
You seemed to ignore the entire part where the government is overseeing the federal reserve, called it crony capitalism yourself but then claims its private and not influenced?
Oh yeah, that advice you gave; don't ever hide anything from the public, that's how we don't change our perspectives and we stay caught in our own ideologies..dark world you fall into there. Sad you think that way really.
@_date: 2019-05-08 19:54:55
Side stepping again.
90%? Where did that ambiguous figure show up?
Let's keep that number for a moment though, for fun. Does that mean they are, at least, 10% not private, which would mean they are, at least, 10% government run?
Man, I can't name a single other private entity that gets to be, at least, 10% government run and paid for. You just made me realize how sweet of a deal they really have.
Solid question. Can the Federal Reserve fail? You know, like a non-crony private business can?
@_date: 2019-05-01 15:35:04
For a CEO, maybe that is a 'general (widely accepted) point', but for overall general 'rich' people. No, this is not generally widely accepted. It is created in our heads that this is the way people with money act. I believe you call that a fallacy.
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:15:37
I don't think that made any logical sense?
A simple Google search, does not do the trick. Do you even know how to search things on the internet? 
You say because they claim it's 'private', it's just not owned by the government at all, in any way. That is silly and I have made my case for why that is not entirely correct and is just a marketing ploy. Please, continue to live off that one piece until the ship goes down. 
But hey, look at me, I'm responding just to respond, with nothing to challenge with just so this person doesn't get the last word.
Come on, you can do better than that.
@_date: 2019-05-08 20:47:00
Haha. I like you man. 
If bitcoin had a tipbot like xrp, i'd tip you.
@_date: 2019-05-06 14:16:19
Banks are not the problem as much as government giving them the power to be the problem...is the problem...
Hayak understood this.
@_date: 2019-05-07 22:23:16
You agree it's crony capitalism but you don't think it's run by the government? I believe they call that, irony.
Analogies can be to explain a point-of-view in new ways, in hopes they understand what you are trying to explain. Just for futures sake.
@_date: 2019-05-08 18:30:44
I'm staying on topic, on point. How is that a side step? You are literally doing exactly what you claim I'm doing..
Let me stay on topic, yet again, just because wiki says it's private, does not mean it is 100% 'private'. Far more into this than that. (That's what Google says when you search federal reserve, THAT IS NOT A SIDE STEP!)
@_date: 2019-05-01 14:53:07
You're assuming he has a jet and 7 homes...
Assuming a lot actually.
@_date: 2019-05-08 13:15:48
Haha you just lost big. Option D, please.
No. I said crony capitalism, which would mean the power of the federal government allows the private sector to influence how they do things to better benefit themselves. So you're right, the bank GAINS the power but only through the government or that power wouldn't exist on the scale it does today.
Wait, the government worries about the debt? Since when? Is that why they continue to spend and print money endlessly? Obama spent more than every president combined! We really don't see things the same way, at all. 
No post moving here, sorry. If you can't see this control they have and the crony shit going on, that's on you. Keep reading what you want and cherrypick the government's power based off your Google search haha! It is labeled 'private' but in absolutely no way does it operate like my business does. 
You keep telling yourself this self righteous crap.
@_date: 2019-05-01 17:16:58
We are "specifically" on CEO's because mizary1 cherrypicked it at some point which you've decided to carry as the base now. The original comment/post had absolutely nothing to do with anyone specific actually. 
So no, it's not generally accepted unless you cherrypick the type of rich person.
@_date: 2019-05-06 19:45:34
Are you a registered bank or a person on the street 'loaning' a friend money? Two completely different things.
@_date: 2019-05-07 17:57:19
Haha. You keep telling yourself that. Actually kind of funny that people still believe that crap. 
This is what they do, they hide so much of their power behind walls, telling people lies about how it really works.
The way I see this, you get onto a computer with a Users login. You can't access the system files under a normal users account. No 'federal' power as they would say, "see it isn't run by the feds!"...well, open up a terminal window, 'root' in underneath the hood and take power. 
Sudo power.
@_date: 2019-05-06 19:31:19
I see what you are saying, but the only reason they have the power today is because the government was there to give it to them. You take away the federal governments power, their ability to print money endlessly and essentially do whatever they want then we have hope. Otherwise you are right, this will never end until we overthrow it all.
@_date: 2019-05-01 17:35:44
Haha awesome. You had nothing because you know you could never prove that generally accepted bullcrap even for CEOs.
Here you are, cherry picking again though.
@_date: 2019-05-07 02:44:22
The government loans the banks money via the federal reserve. The government owns the supply of money.
@_date: 2019-05-06 19:08:07
Haha, wait. How does a bank take power and disregard the government? A 'rogue' bank doesn't exist in a 1st world country. This is exactly why big banks don't want bitcoin/crypto, they can't lobby their way through this one.
FDIC approved my friend.
