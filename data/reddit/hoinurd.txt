Multiple shadow bans?

I've run a full node before, but shut it down when I ran low on hard drive space.

Thanks for the response.  As of now, I don't support XT.  I don't see a reason to increase the block size, and I'm of the opinion that XT will implement a new altcoin.  If I'm wrong, please explain.  I guess my real only way to vote is to sell my vast wealth of BTC and wait for the dust to settle.

I hope he just bought himself a sweet ride!

Which I'm willing to do.  I believe (could be wrong) that the prune option doesn't support a wallet in Core, which was why I didn't at the time.

I run a full node at work.  However, I am IT :)

70% of the time, this guy's gut is right 83% of the time.  I'm all in!

I'm still holding out hope that this is not true.  I hope Tsipras goes back to the Greek government, and they vote no on the terms of the bailout.  Then Tsipras turns around, and says "Sorry, they wouldn't go for it" and gives Merkel the bird and walks away.

Who knows.  I don't see anything on the horizon to amp up the price.  There are several negatives though:
- the blockchain is about to leave bitcoin behind.  
- the size debate is getting ridiculous.  It's gotten to the point of arguing about how to argue.

Not really sure who to believe...

Gold should have no bearing on bitcoin.  Gold can be over bought and over sold...bitcoin cannot.  The day you can buy or sell bitcoin futures is the end of bitcoin.

And the creation of said loop causes the internets to crash.

Same here.  I'll have to keep an eye on the bandwidth suckage, but as long as my ISP doesn't throw a fit, I'll keep it running.
@_date: 2015-07-20 19:20:35
Yes, I believe so.  But a roughly 1-1300 chance ain't bad I guess.

But usually the something stupid is a hooman who entered a bad route...

New to bitcoin - I'm running a full node for no reason other than to help the network.  That said - the amount of storage and bandwidth is concerning.  I understand that the beauty of the system is the public ledger with copies on thousands of computers.  But in many places, and especially under-developed countries, bandwidth is at a premium.  Are there are general thoughts on this - ways to reduce bandwidth consumption?  Also, I read somewhere that the bitcoin network can only handle a small number of transactions per second.  Will increasing the block size limit alleviate that?

There's an app for that.  Bitcoin Ticker on iPhone...not sure if there's an equivalent on droid.
@_date: 2015-07-31 12:03:11
Yeah.  I knew I'd say something stupid in my drunken state last night.  And there it is.

You're welcome.  The stats on that site are pretty neat to see too.  
@_date: 2015-07-21 12:08:36
I don't know for sure that they would.  But I already use a pretty good amount of data doing offsite backups, and this may or may not double my upload.

Noob here..explain please?
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:45:28
What I'm wondering is what font / size you're set at that cuts off the letters...
