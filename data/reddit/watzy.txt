Perhaps some can be directed to bitcoin.org?

I hold the opinion that the ATO is applying the law correctly. It is your elected representatives that you should be annoyed at. Write to your local MP.

There are some very specific scenarios under the tax law of today where you will be better off paying FBT instead of income tax.

Was there any mention of the GST treatment of Bitcoin?

There's actually nothing discretionary about the business/personal distinction at all. It's actually fairly settled law, and there are a lot of cases published that details what the characteristics of "running a business" are. Just because the subject matter is Cryptocurrency does not make the analysis different compared to trading in any other asset class.
Perhaps have a discussion with your accountant on considering a private ruling, or perhaps formulating a "reasonably arguable position" for your lodgement? (these are terms your accountant will be familiar with).

I can't give you specific advice. The following is general advice only:
There is actually an ATO publication for taxation of Crypto in Australia, which is available here: 
The tax treatment generally relates to whether your activities are personal in nature, or whether they are akin to carrying on a business. Your actual intent is not conclusive. It is very fact based, ie if you are actively trading throughout the year for a profit making motive, it can be taken to be a business.
If it's a business, then it's treated as trading stock. No different to the trading of shares/forex/goods.
If it's not a business, then Capital Gains Tax provisions apply. Bitcoin is classified as a collectible, so it's exempt if your cost base is less than $10,000.

An an Australian accountant. Am also a bitcoin enthusiast. Happy to point you in the right direction if you want Bitcoin-related accounting answers.

That is incorrect.

Accountant here. You can somewhat rely on certain ATO rulings (as in the ATO binds itself to apply the law in accordance with their ruling). Strictly speaking if you disagree with the ATO rulings you can challenge them, but this will most likely involve a legal process.
There is a compendium (not binding on the ATO) that summarises and links to specific determinations (binding on the ATO) available

You are incorrect. It will depend on the facts. The $10,000 personal use asset exemption from CGT only applies if you're using bitcoin for personal use consumption.
If you buy and sell bitcoin as an investment asset then any realisation will be a CGT event.
If you buy and sell bitcoin in the course of a business (ie a trader) then you treat bitcoin as trading stock.

Lightning's standard allows transactions to be conducted in sub-satoshi units.

Probably why Bitcoins are trading at around a 5% premium in the AUD market compared to the USD market.
