Hamilton started the financial system for the USA, and “basically” the world... basically allowing us to use stable dollars to support a lifestyle as we see normal and fit into today’s day in age.
Hamilton is the the founding father of the USA, but was also a banker, and an economist.
Personally I think Hamilton is to bitcoin, asNixon is to bitcoin Cash

XRP is centralized, and has 100,000,000,000 units! 
It’s crypto crap!
And if your asking about the word cringe... I’ve seen it excessively used on YouTube and Facebook comments, usually by women, who always seem to have a display picture when no one else bothers to post one!
I think people think it’s cool to use the word, so they do it for the sake of knowing how to use it!
