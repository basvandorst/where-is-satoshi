i'm noticing this too.  opened it up at 16300.  saw it go down to around 15k and back up to 16300ish in a matter of less than a minute.  it's at 16.5k now

Yup.  I'm sure being involved in a lot of markets and having several different prices is how a lot of people are using crypto markets to profit.

Yeah, I'm bracing for the inevitable price correction.  but it's nice to see the potential permanent interest out there.

As just said, if you are paying your electricity bill then you are better off putting the money directly into BTC, but if you are not then go for it and get some mBTC.
I wish I knew about mining a few months back, I didn't have to pay my electricity bill in my previous apartment and had 4-5 useless laptops sitting around.

Good shit.  Have you tried picking random dates in the past and using the variables in the equation to see how accurate it would have predicted the present price and other historical prices?

It actually just dropped 400-500 over the past 24h.  Good timing for my Tuesday deposit.  
Try (I think) to get some basic knowledge.  But you should get a solid answer here.  Both seem like good communities.
I use coinbase, gdax, and electrum presently.  With a hardware wallet on the way, ledger nano s.

There should be a tag on this subreddit that says something like 'I want to believe'
@_date: 2017-08-16 17:59:05
nah, you are locked at the price at the time you bought the BTC.  If it goes up good, if it goes down, tough luck.

I hear ya. One every 10-20 posts is expected. But every other post and sometimes 4 or 5 in a row is annoying.  Prepare hide button spam.

Same, I just saw a bunch of the meme type on new. I'll check the front page of the sub maybe once or twice a day, but new and rising is much better outside of the circlejerk. But that's what the hide button's for. Cheers!

There is a warning, it says available Wednesday, 8/23/2017 if I were to buy BTC right now.  It also has [this link]( right next to the date.
edit:  whatever, don't read the the page before you send your money to coinbase.  doesn't bother me.  you're going to be SOL a lot if you don't read.

Cool, thanks for the x-axis
@_date: 2017-08-20 12:55:41
Didn't read and saw the same.  I have yet to read anyone say it's mainstream. Click bait red flag 
Edit: reported for spam. Lemme know if that's not appropriate

You know what? You should. You've earned it
