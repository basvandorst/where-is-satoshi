Intelligence is relative, especially when the lead dev thinks the sun revolves around the earth.  Comparatively speaking, there's smart money in bitcoin!

My favorite bitcoin visionary &amp; expert is the one who genuinely believes the sun rotates around the earth.

I would prefer to follow the original vision of bitcoin conveyed by the inventor of bitcoin, rather than its current project lead who thinks the sun revolves around the earth.  Sorry, I just find the former just a tad more credible than the latter.

Don't worry, there will be no more adoption to bitcoin.  The blocks are totally full, this is it.

So why does this sub have an active war going with Chinese miners and pool owners who are fighting Segwit?  I think it's because they have an inordinate amount of power and say in how bitcoin is ran - directly contradicting your statement.  Why do you think this is happening?

The smart money is invested in coins which are capable of more than 3tps, do not have 100,000 transaction backlogs, and do not have toxic community infighting.

People still go there, but the place is always maxed out and has no room to grow, and the lines are always long. Even a 5 year old can see why your argument is stupid.
