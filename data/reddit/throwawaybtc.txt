I'm already using tor. Do you recommend any mixing services upon withdrawal? Is instawallet good?
One site I use lets you deposit to unique addresses. The other does not. For the one that does not, should I use something like instawallet in between?

Hey, I recently started using your site. How long after an event date do you pay out winnings? For example, I am awaiting:
"The MtGox Closing Price of Bitcoin will be greater than or equal to 11.52 USD Aug 12th, 2011"
"Team USA will have the highest total number of all medals in the 2012 summer Olympics."
"USA Men's basketball team will win the gold medal in London 2012 Olympic Games"

So if they do a chargeback after you transfer the balance, you're fine?

 looks like it has almost the exact same odds as bitbook.biz . The one plus I see about bitbook.biz is you can buy/sell 0.5 point increments for a lot of games. I don't like it's interface as much as nitrogensports though.
Been using nitrogensports for 2 months now. They've been around since March. Very low vig (juice) and allows you to do teasers.
I've had experience with  and  as well. They're good sites but they have higher vig. Anonibet has all sorts of sports. Btcsportsbet has the best reputation.
Also, check out  They have some unique teaser options too but their individual bets have some high vig.

Iranian Rial (IRR) is the official currency of Iran. But in practice, nobody expresses prices in it except for formal sticker prices or ads. Instead, they use the Toman which is equivalent to 10 Rials.
But in common language, the word "thousand" is usually dropped. If someone says something cost 4 or 5.5, they mean it costs 4000 Toman (40000 Rial) or 5500 Toman (55000 Rial).
For larger transactions (rent or real estate) in conversation, the numbers are inferred or explicit. For example, rent in a big city would be quoted as 4 and 5.5 or as 4 million and 5 million (Toman).
Real estate in a big city would be quoted as 1 and 2.3 or 1 billion and 2.3 billion (toman). If someone quoted real estate at 800, they mean 800 million (toman).

OPs image explained the concept better than the 5 or so times I've seen it mentioned.

Gyft is safer but the problem is it doesn't use a favorable exchange rate and it doesn't discount gift cards.
