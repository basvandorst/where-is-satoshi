Prove that a God does exist. Science, logic, and reason are based upon the evidence of something, not the fact of not having disproving evidence

I believe that it is actually a pretty simple issue. People used to believe the earth was flat, but when presented with evidence otherwise, they must either admit their mistake or continue to live in denial. Bring evidence of any god existing, or live in ignorance.
it is not the burden of the accused to disprove, rather the accuser to prove. Innocent until proven guilty is the same concept.

400 mil in a long position got liquidated, scared a few big investors likely, and the market followed the fear.

Nord might accept bitcoin, but they definitely aren't worth giving your money too. I bought a year subscription in September of 2016 because my circumstance required one, and their service was great for about a month, and then it felt like, and my up/down reflected it, that my connection got throttled to the server, and it was not done by my router or ISP. 
PIA does a great service and I would gladly reccommend them to friends, family, and strangers on the internet.
