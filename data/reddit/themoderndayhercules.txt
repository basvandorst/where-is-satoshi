Sure. Yes, BTC and BCH and all related PoW blockchains use the same tech, so they are vulnerable in the same way. There might be improvements to future implementations that make selfish miners' life harder, some are detailed in the original article. The standard implementation updates everyone once the block is validated, but a selfish miner can run his own software, implementing the selfish mining strategy, and not follow this rule. In that case the honest miners will be mining on the last publicly known block, which could be behind the private ledger of the selfish miner and so eventually thrown away. Hope this helps

I'm not totally sure I got your first sentence, seemed interesting though. At some point of making the calculations I also reached a conclusion that bitcoin price does not affect transaction rate, but it doesn't stand a more thorough examination. The thing is, if we believe MV=PQ, then M grows linearly with PQ, and as prices in the real economy are irrelevant to the discussion, then we understand that the reason bitcoin prices went up are growth in the number of transactions being done in bitcoin terms. I actually didn't fully understand the second sentence too, also seemed interesting.

Maybe they do, better anyway than reputation token systems, which is what the post is referring to

Thanks for the feedback. I tend to disagree with your disagreements, though I get the point. 
I don't want to write 'bitcoin' vs 'bitcoin cash' because the terminology kind of assumes bitcoin cash are the deviants which is a position I didn't want to take. Anyway, as it is a bit misleading, made a fix there. 
The determining time regarding latency in my view is when do you feel safe to make the transfer of goods. It seems like these are inherently shorter times in centralized payment system than in bitcoin. But I get your point, once in a million times someone will claim the visa payment was a fraud and as a merchant you will be liable for the costs.
