I can't tell you how many bitcoin atms I've used that need 1 confirm for withdrawals of $10-50 and i have to wait 10+ min once i had to wait 25 min. with litecoin and even doge its 1-3 min for 1 confirm. Bitcoin is great but litecoin and doge are better for such transactions

As an early adopter on Gox it took 2 hours to deposit BTC from my wallet and by that time the price would go up or down 30% making me lose money in any trade especially when BTC was like $0.5-1! Also BTC scams were not obvious or common then cos they were so cheap and people didn't take BTC seriously. It's only when it spiked to $30 that's when the fraud/scams started and people realised BTC could be worth a lot.

Manipulation, bitfinex CEO said they were people who wanted to dump a large amount of bitcoins on the market but their algos flagged that up but didn't stop it, instead it slowed them down hence the prolonged price decrease. Also he said an unusual number of short swaps appeared 2 days before the first price drop. If that isn't manipulation then I don't know what is.

Yes well we will see. I believe China knows it can't continue to devalue their currency so that they maintain their exports. That's just economically not sustainable with ever developing technology to break free and a more aware population. It's clear that they are relaxing their laws on the population, the one child policy has stopped for example, a free internet there will just be a matter of time. What they are looking to do is to improve manufacturing and business within china long term and the key to that sustainability is to have a strong currency ideally backed by gold. With unlimited QE of the dollar youre right the dollar is becoming worthless and China's $3trillion reserves can't be sold but what they are doing is buying up real estate and businesses in the us with those reserves. A clever move. There is a macroeconomic war going on but I believe china holds most of the aces because it's buying all the gold so is Russia that's why there is so much anti Russian sentiment in the media. Expect China to announce that they have 5000 tonnes go gold and they are going to back the rmb with that and make it a world reserve currency in the next 5 years. Have you read currency wars by Jim Rickards?
@_date: 2014-04-10 09:47:43
Yeah and this is a momentary rise. The downtrend (yuan rise vs USD) will continue as the living standards and wages improve over there. I'm not a fan of their government but China won't be Argentina as they and their people have plenty of gold reserves to fight off inflation and the coming collapse of the dollar. China has signed so many bilateral trade and currency deals using the yuan and a lot of countries will need that currency so the value vs the dollar will continue to rise but every few years the temporarily halt that growth. Look at this weeks gas deal with Russia it's the biggest in the world. PBOC want the yuan to be the world reserve currency and that means the wealth needs to be backed up by a universally valuable tangible item that can be relied upon which is gold. They also want investment and wealth and distribution in china with gold or yuan not something highly speculative, non tangible and decentralised like bitcoin (gold is decentralised but has 5000 years of history as money and doesn't look like ending soon)

I agree this is only for explorative purposes and not bulk mining but the cost of huge rocket ships that can carry tonnes machinery there  and production plant and hundreds of tonnes of ore back as well as the fuel you mentioned would require the price of gold to be in $100k-$1m + per ounce for it to even break even.

Dogecoin has helped the crypto community by bringing a diverse demographic of people that bitcoin and litecoin failed to do and has a very large community and active dev team. It was designed as a currency and not as digital gold like bitcoin is hence the 1 minute block conf times and 5% annual inflation. This means that the goal is not to go to $1000+ like bitcoin not even $10 or $2. The goal is for it to encourage spending not hoarding. Achieving reasonable value takes time but the community and dev team are actively creating an economy and infrastructure along with dogeparty (counterparty of dogecoin) that will, in time make it widely adopted

I was actually a poor student for a long time before I had BTC but I cashed out 6% of my holdings and quit my job in early December which basically was a lot of money. I paid off my debts (which was a lot too) bought a nice car and now looking to get married and buy a house this year hopefully. As far as I'm concerned 100 BTC was not brave for me I'm comfortable now. So I put 100 BTC as I can afford to lose that as it is worth a shot but for any one new to cryptos 1 BTC is enough to start with for dogecoin. You can look back in 6 years and probably say I was one of those early BTC LTC doge adopters!

He looks so relaxed even to the point he might break out in a smile! Maybe seems likely due to the fact he may feel it's not his fault- that the BTC was taken from him by force from a powerful entity that we all know perhaps? In his recent comments when asked about if he lost his BTC he said they were "not lost but temporarily unavailable". So are his and everyone's BTC been seized perhaps? It's all very shady but one thing is clear he doesn't look or behave like a guilty man!

interesting ok what i want to know is what would the cost of gold need to be to be profitable using current technology. 
Now consider that you have taken into account the orbit of eros being a mars-crosser rather than an earths crosser, how the quantity and price of fuel be to get there and back 7 times as you claim right now given the distance from earth now, how long will the mining process take and what does the price of gold has to be right now per ounce to break even assuming you spent enough money to deal with:
1. the radiation aspect 
2. landing/taking off a low gravity moving target
3. traction/cohesion/anchorage for mining

I'm sorry but that's nonesence. There are no HFT algos here. It's pure manipulation as I've seen this market for 4 years now. 
Bitfinex CEO said they were people who wanted to dump a large amount of bitcoins on the market in seconds but their algos flagged that up but didn't fully stop it, instead it slowed sell orders down in an orderly fashion hence this protracted price decrease on no news. Also he said an unusual number of short swaps appeared 2 days before the first price drop. If that isn't manipulation then I don't know what is.
Also if you are selling on the news you obtained well ahead of the market you don't dump 1000+ coins in 10 seconds if you are looking to make a killing then you have enough time to stagger your selling so as to get the maximum amount of money for your trade and naturally it applies to buying ofcourse.
In gold and silver markets which I'm very familiar with there is a cartel of bankers who creat naked shorts which dump thousands of GLD and SLV contracts in seconds which works out equivalent to 10% to 50% of the yearly mined supply of gold and silver. This is rediculous since the assumption that a few entities have upto half the total world PM supply every day is highly improbable. 
What sophisticated HFTs do to move a market is carry out wash trades where they create orders and the cancel them in a fraction of a second. The price then executes the next trade in the orderbook from someone else instead and so this HFT continues to carry out thousands of wash trades a second for a prolonged period of time moving the price all the way up or down the orderbook while preventing any other new market participants to create/complete their order which is a reaction to the price movement. The HFT traders don't require much capital as the trades are cancelled and the remaining participants in the orderbook gets their trades completed 'by force' 
Therefore IMO we have not observed any such HFT trading bots and what we have seen is cartel collusion to either help initiate a price up or guarantee the price to go down by insta-dumping 1000+ BTC in seconds like we are witnessing right now.

thats the whole basis of this post is to space mine for gold. of course there are a lot more precious materials we can extract/synthesise which would be a lot more cost efficient but thats not the point of this discussion. 
Ok let me phrase it another way what would the price need to be for gold per ounce for that to be as precious as other materials to make it worthwhile to mine gold primarily assuming a cost efficient extraction method devised for asteroid nickel-iron ore that would produce 35% recovery just as in pyritic ores from cyanidation?


lol what that actually highlighted is the length of time it takes to get there and back not including the mining process with a double gravity assist which is 7 years assuming the asteroid and the moon and earth are at their closest. not suitable for a mars crosser such as Eros but for near earth asteroids.
the reason why I posted and i believe we are in agreement here is that a lot of the anti gold shills will have us believe that just because gold may be abundant out of earth its somehow less valuable cos 30000 tonnes are available in one of many asteroids. I know there is a lot more gold deeper in the earths crust and of course in the the mantle and core mixed with iron. Thats why i commented in the first place

I was a young boy in the early 90s and IMO the internet was seen as something new that people found difficult to grasp. A lot of older people didn't get it and I would say 4/5 adults didn't see a need for it. Everything was on tv they had telephones for calls and had printers and fax machines for sending documents. The internet back then was for geeks and porn lovers. It was only until Amazon came along and became popular in the late 1990s that people saw it as a tool for commerce. Information was still sent on paper but the fact you can buy things from something intangible without leaving your doorstep was a game changer. By year 2000 emails became popular and sending and receiving information became useful. By 2003 the video and music revolution started and soon after social media took off too. It was all progressive steps. 
Even as close back as 2010 when the iPad came out people didn't see a need for it I mean we already had a laptop for use on the go and a desktop for office/home use. When I first saw it I had to have one because that was the thing I needed I didn't want a clunky laptop I surfed the net a lot and on the go I was surfing the net on my iPhone 2 on the train. Laptops don't have wifi and they are so big still I thought. I was the first guy to implement the iPad as a sales tool in my company 2 years ago and now it's standard issue there. Soon we won't have laptops and I envision that all we will be carrying is smart phones and tablets that serve as our computer, phone, wallet and keys for your house and car. That's my prediction as we won't need anything else but do 4/5 adults say that?

interesting thanks for your perspective however, controlling the price because you are the biggest player in the market is still manipulation. In commodity markets the CFTC rules state that no entity should have a position greater than 25% of estimated deliverable supply, 10% of open interest in the first 25000 contracts and 2% thereafter. Why is that? "The Commodity Exchange Act (CEA) authorized the Commodity Futures Trading Commission to impose limits on the size of speculative positions in futures markets. Core Principle 5, of Section 5(d) of the CEA, requires designated contract markets to adopt speculative position limits or position accountability for speculators, where necessary and appropriate, to reduce the potential threat of market manipulation or congestion, especially during trading in the delivery month.[2]" [Ref](


Just because the guy has the capital/coins or doesn't have the capital/coins but faking them (naked shorts) the actions are still the same - he is still controlling the price one way or another. Isn't that a form of manipulation just as the CFTC outlined.
Are pumps and dumps in alt coins for example not manipulation? all it takes is 1000 bitcoins in a small alt coin market with enough liquidity and you can make 10000 btc after you dumped?
Whether they are futures positions or actual coins big players can greatly influence the price regardless of fundamentals or technicals and skew commodity markets.
Whats to stop China/chinese elite for example with 35% of all USD/Euro and USD/CNY forex (theoretically if they had much) to crash the price of the dollar against a backdrop of exceptional gdp growth and excellent jobs report and NFD.  Wouldn't that be a form of manipulation?

Erik I think I say this on behalf of a lot of people in the bitcoin/cryptocurrency community: while I am surprised you had BTC in Gox I'm comforted to see that you admitted your naivity and immediately sought to reassure this community to be vigilant and defiant in the face of such deceit. You are typical of a lot of us in this community who have come here with an open mind and an open heart that's willing to trust people in the hope that they too are decent and honorable. Afterall bitcoin is born out the need for a new financial system that empowers every citizen to control their own money. A honorable premise in itself.

I'm a huge bitcoin/digital currency advocate but I have to say you have no clue about gold. Gold has been a store of value for 6000 years and its never going to seriously decline in value in 5-10 years. You can't dismiss 6000 years of psychology in in 5-10 years it will never happen. 
Its not useless, its highly thermally conductive and UV reflective (used in spacecrafts and satellite parts), electrically conductive (wire coatings), the most ductile and malleable  and doesn't rust or tarnish (used as jewellery) of all metals.  In fact because of golds unique properties it has over 1000 different industrial applications however the cost is so prohibitive in a lot of cases.
As for stores not accepting gold well its definitely accepted in most developing and third world countries as well as china and many other developed asian middle eastern countries. Its only in western countries such as US and UK. You go to a store in Greece, Portugal, italy and find someone that doesn't accept gold as payment. Don't worry the next global financial collapse will make every store owner in the world beg for gold. Finally if you ever owned an ounce of gold you will know $1200 in your pocket as opposed to $1200 cash is so inconspicuous and light. Gold is so dense so 1 kg is really small that your hand can cover it.. This means that carrying 3kg of gold for example can fit in your pocket comfortably so thats $115,000! When gold goes to $20,000 an ounce which is inevitable given the worlds financial situation 3kg will be $643,000.

Disagree with some of your points read the comments here to see their viewpoints on mining and price correlation. SR was used by the mainstream media to knock bitcoin down so much so that politicians wrote to Congress about it. Now that the main player is off our back and bitcoin price remains high it will be seen in a more positive light. You are right in that it will result in many more players on the scene but they will be a lot less known and will take time to build up any sort of reputation! The term legal tender however inaccurate it's context is used commonly by press to associate it with acceptance but I understand and next time I will use more appropriate words. Overall this post has raised interesting and quite useful info that have varying opinions. By debating more often with many people we will only understand the topic further and uncover new points that people would not have thought of.

Bitcoin's intrinsic value comes from its cryptography where it is based on an algorithmic encryption protocol that is so far uncrackable and so people are confident to exchange it for goods and services. 
Bitcoin meets all the criteria which classify it as money unlike fiat currency ($,€,£). 
Bitcoin is:-
1. A Medium of exchange- it only takes 2 people to see value in the same thing to exchange goods and services with it. It doesn't have to be backed by a government like fiat just common faith.
2. Divisible -bitcoin can be divided into 100million units, that is to the nearest satoshi - 0.000000001B
3. Portable- you can send bitcoins anywhere in the world in minutes. So far no bank can transfer cash this quick. You can store $billions worth of bitcoins in a flash disk and take it to another country unlike fiat or gold etc where you will be stopped at the border.
4. Fungible - each bitcoin is identical in value so they can be substituted for one another.
5. STORE OF VALUE- this is the most important point and the reason why bitcoin was created. Fiat currency depreciate over time because governments issue unlimited amounts of it due to their reckless monetary policies. How much money ($€£) does bread, milk, meat, shelter cost now as opposed to 10, 20, 30 years ago?! The reason it's a store of value is because there is a cap to the number of bitcoins that will be generated (21 million). It also takes a lot of computing power, which is very expensive and requires a certain amount of energy to generate a bitcoin.

You can do a wire transfer just go to the withdrawal tab and choose bank transfer in the dropdiwn box and enter your bank details. It should take 2-5 days to recieve your funds but you will be charged around £20. It's a pretty easy step just make sure you have your IBAN number for your bank and account details.

Yes your correct but lots of new people adopt bitcoin everyday and that's where further growth comes from

I wired to BTC-e small and large amounts and they were processed within 7 days and as early as 3 days. I also withdrew from BTC-e several times over the last 2 months and it took 4-5 days so they are very good. I did the same for Gox it took 4 days but that was several months ago I don't know how it's like now.

Erik the free market will dictate what will be a success and what won't. I'm just surprised you don't see enough value in alternate crypto currencies which in fact legitimises Bitcoin more and provides price stability it sorely needs. I'm a bitcoin and litecoin advocate and if the other alternate crypto currencies offer value then the free market will reflect that.
@_date: 2013-11-27 11:20:26
I responded to his criticism with a balanced view point as his interpretation is flawed contradictory. I just don't understand how he portrays free market thinking yet contradicts himself when the free market speculates on Litecoin and other altcoins

Erik what do you want litecoin to do? Fly, make you a sandwich? It's a cryptocurrency that offers a quicker transaction time on an alternative blockchain. Competition in every sector is good for the consumer there is VISA MasterCard Amex PayPal and USD, GBP EUR CNY. There is ford Toyota BMW mercedes. I'm starting to think that you are so heavily invested in bitcoin that you don't want litecoin to share in the limelight. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 10:11:18
I just explained my reasoning above your post.
@_date: 2013-10-18 10:48:35
The first point is an important contributor to the price as in a favourable environment miners see new ASIC hardware come to the market that render their existing hardware no longer profitable. Their only choice now is to hold Bitcoin's until the price goes much higher to recoup their investment otherwise they will make a loss. Again this can only happen in a favourable environment. This limits the supply of bitcoins and forces a price squeeze up to buy the fewer remaining bitcoins on the market. I thought I made it clear in the first point. Miners also seem atleast to set the floor for the price of bitcoin as they don't want to make a loss.

I personally think all the points that the author said are valid
1. Ripple is premined/preprinted- bitcoin isn't so it doesn't give the illusion it's a Ponzi scheme.
2. 51% attacked - it is when you think 1 entity has a monopoly on a currency. They can block you or any organisation from using it that it deems an enemy. 
3. It's certainly not open source. If OpenCoin are known to lie about this then would you trust a liar with your money? Will it ever be open source? It doesn't compare to bitcoin as you can buy things with ripple yet its still closed source. That seems intentional to me.
4. The system of IOUs is what's wrong with the current economic model. Why don't you just pay for what you want and get what you paid for. Ripple is trying to solve a problem that doesn't need to exist. 
5. All the nodes in the ripple network are centralised (as corporations) unlike bitcoin where everyone can be a node putting the power back into the users.
Conclusion: Ripple is not revolutionary, not open source and above all not necessary.
@_date: 2013-05-21 11:41:45
The issue with Ripple is it comes down to trust. Do you trust gateways with your money? With bitcoin, litecoin etc you have your own money cold stored locally if need be. Do you trust someone's IOUs? I can see in the future the bigger the ripple network gets the more centralised it becomes because 3 or 4 gateways become too big to fail until they do. The way they fail is when you have a few dishonest people not fulfilling their IOUs which could be worth millions of dollars/bitcoins/gold/property etc. It seems that this system is much like the current banking model where it favours the elite and not so much the individual. 
I also question OpenCon who hold all 100 billion XRP and eventually after giving away 50% of those they will still be the central holder. Isn't this centralisation at its best? They can crash the price of XRP or manipulate it beyond our affordability.
I believe that eventually when the bitcoin network is so large there will be no need for ripple as everyone in the world is a "gateway" and you can just send privately. 
@_date: 2013-10-18 10:10:29
Well it sounds arbitrary and to some extent it is but once the old high is taken out the human psyche gets attracted to the next big figure which is 300 just like bitcoin was stuck at around 100 early this summer after the crash in April. Why did it hover around 100? It's not exact in my opinion I know but it's around $300 after that the sell pressure could be too high to take it further or if it does exceed that figure then we can enter an even bigger parabolic phase.
@_date: 2013-10-11 21:22:42
I believe we are all thinking small in terms of energy and fossil fuel consumption. It's not bitcoin that will address this it's education and knowledge.  The fact is there are many types of energy resources that can be developed such as thorium nuclear energy. There is no global warming or clean water shortage. We have the desalinators and purifiers but all these little understood technologies are deliberately suppressed from the mainstream knowledge base as that would mean practically free energy water and food for the whole planet. This means corporations from oil, gas and food and water industries can't profit from that. The same goes for drug companies look at the HIV/AIDS scam, there is no evidence that this virus actually exists but financially it's the perfect parasite: undetectable deadly and in curable but with the right retro viral drugs for the rest of your life it's manageable to live for 40+ years. Equally we have technology that can take us to Mars and beyond without the need for jet propulsion just read up on the workings of Nikola Tesla you will be amazed. There is so much hidden secrets in this world that facts in science maths and history are deliberately suppressed. We the bitcoin community should be the first to recognise this.
By the way don't believe me just google this stuff for yourself.

It's the same with Litecoin on this subreddit. It always gets down voted to oblivion. There is always an agenda to suppress truth by people who are afraid of the truth. 
Litecoin and bitcoin should be complimentary.
