Did something similar, albeit at a lower price. At first it was hard to swallow, but if you realize bitcoin has potential for longevity things aren't entirely bad.
Use this as a learning tool then study and look into Dollar Cost Averaging methods to build onto what you have. You may not come ahead right away, but that's far better than eating a loss if you can stand it.

It's like an initiation except with tears and money

That's honestly a really good suggestion. Thank you

Pretty much what he said. Value has been pretty steady in the past two days, so just keep an eye out.

Leaning towards a slightly longer drop before it levels around where we were a week ago. May not see a spike, but definitely not a drop near zero.
Then again, who the hell knows.

Read the last paragraph as SUICIDE, still works

Probably the most important

Coinbase makes you wait about a week for your coins as a first time purchaser
@_date: 2016-06-24 19:42:58
That's what I was thinking. I can afford to keep the coins, just didn't know if I should try to recoup my losses or break even. Definitely see potential in bitcoin

AFAIK a majority of US and UK RC transactions take place using btc, even with legality considerations. It's far easier for the customer and vendor due to the currency's anonymity. So with a major market dropping out of the scene (UK), it's certainly plausible that the buying/selling of btc affected valuation. 
But this is all speculation. Just wanted to toss in my two bits

No, I got lucky the first time and have no intention of doing that again. I'm just debating buying back in now to hold out for a while since this has been the biggest dip in a while.
From here on out it's HODL. My heart can't take it otherwise lol

I have an app that keeps the price constantly updated on my phone's sleep screen.
I think the addiction caught me a few months ago
@_date: 2016-07-02 04:18:43
Yeah.. I don't think I'll be doing that again. I lucked out by getting all my stuff shipped, but it probably got my accounts closed. Never used them anyway so... eh.

He's saying buy around Monday. It's peaking at the moment so you'd just be paying more to buy it now.
@_date: 2016-07-02 17:21:07
They haven't stolen your funds, but their time delay and lack of customer support is ridiculous. I use them mainly to get USD transferred to circle, and that's it.
Best bet is to wait out the holiday at this point.

Just curious how many of you made a large buy recently. I could spread out buys everyday sure, but I'm also tempted to just buy a big chunk now.
@_date: 2016-07-02 04:17:56
There's not one surefire strategy. Your best bet is watching trends, keeping up with bitcoin news (from multiple sources), and of course educating yourself on how markets work.
I unfortunately bought in at 660-680 so I'm still holding out. It may be a good idea to drop for a profit in case we hit another dip, but who knows how far that is.

So, you're asking people to use a payment method with even higher chargeback risk, after paypal banned you for the same exact thing?
@_date: 2016-07-02 20:55:16
Yeah they do direct deposits. What happens if you leave your account is USD, is that any bitcoin sent to that account is automatically converted to USD at their exchange rate (found under the settings tab). So it's a nice and quick way to sell BTC, but you're limited to their rate.
