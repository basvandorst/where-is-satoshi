That's like saying low level protocols need to be user friendly, when they shouldn't even be made aware of to the user. Applications and services are built on top of those protocols, and they expose the user friendly side.

Until you have to scale again.
And again, and again.

In the future your balance won’t be thought of in BTC, but by satoshi or even a smaller metric

Mempool txs are released after 2 weeks of left unprocessed, I believe

Here's what I'm trying to get clarity on:
From what I've gathered, institutions do not have to buy/secure BTC for these contracts -- it's more so a contract on the price at time X?
I was originally thinking there'd be a *massive* volume movement on the markets from institutions securing coins for contracts -- but that does not seem to be the case. Is that right?

Yeah when I first heard of the futures market opening, I thought institutions would have to secure coins for contracts. That’s not the case, it’s purely a contract for a value change. I’d say it’s almost like a derivative

Curious -- how'd you learn so much about Zimbabwe? I've recently gotten interested in history (mainly around WWI -&gt; WWII) and have started to notice/appreciate when folks understand things past the basics (what _causes_ something, versus _what happened_)
