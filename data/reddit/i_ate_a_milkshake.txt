oh, to be 15 again. you cant 'divulge' into topics, you 'divulge' information. you could 'delve' into some topics and then 'divulge' what you've learned. you used the word wrong. take your lumps and move on. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:17:20


oh man, you really tried to sound smart there too. shame.
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:23:58
it isnt. but its a dumb one when you use it wrong. 
the word you were looking for was 'delve' but language is probably just a big conspiracy.
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:05:25
congrats! you got the point.

bitcoin is NOT anonymous. it is pseudo-anonymous. many cyber-forensic fompanies already exist to attach names to bitcoin addresses.
Monero, on the other hand, has a cryptographically protected blockchain, and is completely anonymous.

hence Charlie Lee selling all his LTC this week. people called him a scammer and a PnDer and said he was abandoning them, when really he was doing the best thing he could do for his community: blend into the background like Satoshi did.

Bitcoin Trump.
the resemblance is spooky. lying psychopathic rich boy whips a whole bunch of susceptible people into a frenzy against their own interests for a massive profit. and it works.

BitConnect is down %20 over the last 24h, so it would seem the confusion is hurting them for now.
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:48:41
but that was an Outkast song. what else are you hiding??
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:16:27
we can disagree, that's alright.
all the best.
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:04:36
ahh out come the detractors. 
"it has no inherent value!"
"its a bubble!"
"tulip mania!"
we've heard it all before, man. give it a rest.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:11:19
are you saying you still haven't bought? dude for christ's sake stop doing this to yourself! buy bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-11-26 07:11:27
for me, its about way more than the money.
the implications of blockchain tech are tremendous. its a way to host data in a completely decentralized, trustless, immutable data structure.
this can be used in almost every sector of any economy, and it will be. blockchain is on par with the internet itself as an innovation.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:27:21
Yes, Doge was essentially always a joke-coin. 
That doesn't mean you can't make money off it, though. I bought 170k at the bottom (16 sats) and I'm currently up like $130. Expecting a huge pump and dump in the next few months. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:56:06
yep. and services like bitmex (up to 100x leverage) dont help. its just a casino disguised as a futures exchange. its made worse by the facts that bitcoin is so valuable and they only settle contracts in bitcoin. it doesnt feel like you lost that much when you lose .1 btc. but that's currently 900+ dollars.
that said, i would rather have pseudo-predatory services exist than governent regulation on crypto, but thats a discussion for another day.
they say a fool and his money are easily parted. problem is everybody is a fool when they first get into this game. Dunning-Kruger has depleted a lot of principle in crypto.

the golden rule of investing (especially in hihgly speculative markets) is to never invest what you can't afford to lose. 
edit: as an additional point, while im sure the FUD would be massive if that were to happen, I think it would ultimately be a good thing. would increase scarcity for a while, and reduce centralization. plus with all the BS Bitmain has been pulling, I would be glad to be rid of them.
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:12:09
some cat on /biz/ posted proof of him shorting bitcoin all-in at 25x leverage and losing everything.
You can't fix stupid. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:04:37
important note: im not investing. im speculating. Doge has a cyclical pump cycle and im taking advantage of it.

we are approaching an age where everyone alive will have been born after the inception of personal computers and the internet. This kind of high-concept, high-tech stuff will be second-nature to a huge percentage of the population before long.

This is exactly why it won't dip too hard. too many people waiting to get in
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:27:52
haha damn dude how many sats until break-even?
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:15:58
I remember people joking about the day we'd be able to use this meme.
it was back when this meme was still relevant, if that helps illustrate how long we've been waiting for this.

Blockchain is fledgling tech. and because of its decentralized nature (everyone has to agree on changes) growth and adaptation is slow. it will get there, blockchain is the future. 
your arguing against mainstream adaptation because people might lose their keys or get them stolen? let's ban cash then cuz people might lose their purse. No, Bitcoin is not ready to replace traditional payment systems, and it won't be for a long, long time. we're getting in on the relative ground floor.

the entire appeal of bitcoin is that it is trustless. if i have to trust miners to be honest, the system is not working properly.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:21:18
you just download the core wallet and run it on your PC. nothing else to it.
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:02:58
number 5 is kind of a nonissue because you get the coins for the price when you bought them, not when you receive them.
