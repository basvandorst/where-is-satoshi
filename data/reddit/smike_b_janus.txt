Beanie babies still have use as toys. And they were very good storage of value and investment instrument until they stopped to be...

And when you want to sell it - the only chance is to sell it to someone believing it will raise further in value. When the people believe it peaked - you will be hodler against your will.

Free bitcoins for everyone?

Maybe this is more appropriate: 
They are still in limited supply,

Why not make another hard fork, like Bitcoin Cash, but toward smaller block size, to find out?

The fees will disappear permanantly, only if the costs disappear.  Initially there were no apparent fees, because the bitcoin was inflated (it still is, at ~3.5%/year), and entusiasts were willing to support it for free. Now, everybody is ecstatic about the price, and few people think about the costs of mining - as far as I know, they are $6/transaction and growing.  Many of the few people that mention the costs, believe they will go down, but no one is working on it.

Try to decrease the cost of mining.

I  haven't studied the crash in details. My theory was based on a claim (I think a WSJ report) that all crypto went down simultaneously.  If you are right - someone sold a lot of bitcoin and caused the 19k to 15k drop. (it still could be for a tax reason).  The news for the drop caused a sell-off in all the crypto for the 15k to 11k drop.

I read in a newspaper that such things happen:
1) you fill taxes following similar tax advice
2) IRS doesn't agree for some reason
3) you end up in court
4) the court decides you have to pay taxes, late fees and penalty for frivolous legal claims.   
Somehow I believe the newspaper story more than you.  If there is a government conspiracy - the court is a part of the government

Just because that there are worse actors, doesn't mean you do not need to improve. There are reasons the gold is abandoned as a currency, and the high cost of production is high on the list.  The copper penny had a similar fate, and the current zinc one is overdue to be dumped, too.

It will be easy, if they decide to do it. Just stop the supply to the electricity hogs, aka "miners". Take over the best miners, shut down the rest and 51% can be held for a very long time...
