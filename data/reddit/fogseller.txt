History repeats, said by a stock expert with curencies. But its not the same with bitcoin, so I dont think it will have, big brakedown again. This graph isn't really possible but it will grow, I think on 7% to 3% perW for next month.

I would use this as a best possible answer.

You are not prottected in a bank. They can do with your money whatever they want and your "money" on your account is just a number - someone elses "money" - showed as yours. So they just do that. Doing that (nothing) takes a fee from your account every month. Having bitcoin, safe, offline (paper lets say), and doing a whole registration procedure from the beginning to the offline storing part in a sterile controlled inveronment safes your money and you from a goddamn bank.

Thanks for your comments. I think this is it. 
Guess somebody had a same idea:
---How It Works---
*Buyer or seller start an escrow transaction
*Buyer and seller confirm their email and bitcoin addresses
*Buyer sends bitcoins to the escrow's bitcoin address
*Seller sends item(s) to buyer
*Inspection period begins when buyer receives item(s)
*Bitcoins are released to seller or a dispute is started

Bought 55 at 7$, sold at 98$. Never again touching Bitcoins. Made about 5000$ profit and left the train.
