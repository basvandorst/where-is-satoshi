I would say what's fair is what the targeted audience could realistically invest in. Could they invest in Apple during their garage days? Probably not. Bitcoin since day one? It was probably harder back then but I would say the avg investor had realistic access to it. More so than a shop in a garage. 
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:05:04
They've been looking at alts because they think bitcoin is too expensive,. Or they are waiting for the crash down to like 5000

@_date: 2017-12-18 23:26:02
Plus additional value and utility is being innovated and realized. Before today I kept hearing bitcoin's future will be a store of value. Lighting network could make bitcoin better able to handle higher transaction use cases. And today I heard of the Ivy language that could be used to do smart contracts using the Bitcoin  network. This is like the internet where you first see the simple and obvious use case but then someone innovates on top of the network/protocol. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 12:24:59

@_date: 2017-12-18 22:58:26
How so? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 20:48:42
Or think of the people who invested at 15 to 20k. The selling could be further influenced by people trying to lock in a loss that they can use to offset against any profits for tax purposes.
Those asking when we will get back to pumping BTC should take a nap until we get I to the new year. My question is will the pump happen right away or a few days in. Trading around tax year deadlines is always an interesting time.

If bitcoin gets to 100k, that means many alts will have been dismissed and it will be that much harder for smaller caps to attract investment.

Why so low? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:01:31
Keep in mind it's not a finished product. It's still years from getting to a Facebook messenger level of  completion. The price will be up and down based upon current money willing to be in it at any given time but 3 years from now I am very comfortable to say now that I expect the protocol to be more functional with more applications on it and more money willing to be in it then.

As long as the futures don't implode the price tonight, and bitcoin survives. People will recognize that the price is not going to crash or get any lower, any uncertainty will be gone for time being, and there will be a rush of more money to get in at the lowest possible price. We could be up 10k by next weekend.

I've read a few articles like this. These guys sound like they interpret bitcoin to be a finished product. It's not. I wonder if they understand that. Sure bitcoin is not a great payment system now but there is active development being done to solve that. We news these people to understand that and learn more such as about lightning network.

This is all happening due to stricter financial regulation.
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:08:02
Correct but if you are thinking like that then you will probably not miss the boat. You might even dollar cost average and get in at a few different entry points. But for noobs... Just get in with a partial investment. It's funny how once you own something you start to pay more attention to it. After some time, you will realize when it's a deal and where the price might be headed in the short term. In the long term, pay attention to the big picture and the big players and overall strategy aligning.

I would predict that this would cause a short term crash or correction in the price. Most people don't keep up with bitcoin very well. They hear prices every now and then Right now they are hearing 6500. If they start hearing quotes of $6,it would likely cause a panic sell by those not knowing what's going on, or temporarily dissuade those from entering the market as it will seem as if bitcoin had lost most of its value and something must be up. I doubt the likes of CNBC would handle or be able to explain it well. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:45:44
Probably if the economy continues to grow  and new housing doesn't keep up. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:15:01
In the article he says he is in favor of permissioned distributed ledgers with a defined set of players. So a small network of banks using blockchain? Fundamentally that's similar to what they have now isn't it? The big banks have some type of network connection between a defined group of financial institutions. Sounds like the SWIFT system they currently use but now they could say they are using a new technology and claims it's safer?
 To me the point of Bitcoin is that you don't need this middle player of the bank or defined network of banks for the function of moving money or value from one client to another. That's the bigger point in the article that is not stated specifically but is alluded to. The CEO of SocGen can't foresee not needing a middle man in the transfer of value.

The exchange rate means a lot today. If you wanted to buy a gallon of milk with bitcoin from someone who accepts bitcoin as payment, how much bitcoin would you pay for it? The store already probably figured out a price but still, don't you care if you are paying $3 USD in Bitcoin vs $8USD in Bitcoin? Today you still need that exchange rate as a reference point. Maybe in 10 years will know that 2 Satoshis is a good deal but 7 is a rip off.

I don't know many idiots at Goldman. If they exist, it's not for much longer.

Especially if you believe bitcoin can be a 50k to 500k coin. Getting in at 6k vs 9k is neglible.

My question is... Where are you storing your bitcoin? Hardware wallet? I will be in  similar situation soon and trying to decide on a best practice storage solution.

Lots of advice here one way or the other. How about dollar cost averaging? Means you give yourself 6 months to be fully invested. Space out 6 buys, by about a month each. However if there is a certain day where a crash occurs, maybe you put in 2 months worth of buys and then go back to monetary buys.
Theres no way of knowing where the price will go. Spacing out you investment allows you to incrementally become invested while getting an average price over time. It's a nice middle of the road strategy anyone can use and allow yourself to sleep at night.

Another tip: this is not true on Gdax.

You guys that are saying that bitcoin is anonymous... Just to buy bitcoin, most people are going through the biggest exchanges that now ask for certain identifying information from you. So you are identified before you even buy. It might not be on the blockchain but Coinbase knows who you are and can tie you back to a wallet address.  They might not hand over the info to the IRS even if asked to but really.. Can't the NSA just hack their way in if they needed to for intelligence purposes? 
How does one get back to anonymity? Sending  your coins from Coinbase to a hardware wallet that you own? Does Trezor or Ledger keep track of the owners and the wallet addresses affiliated to them?

Still a deal if we are headed to 25k-50k

It's hard to make someone understand something when their salary depends on them not understanding it.

Because the actual dollar amount matters less than the percentage move?
