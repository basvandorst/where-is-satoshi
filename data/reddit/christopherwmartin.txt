Holding off buying for too long has been the source of way too much face palming for a lot of us. That said, I think it would be safe to keep an eye on the charts thoughout the next week and buy in around $2700-$2800.
It's also good to keep in mind that if you don't already have an account on an exchange setting one up can sometimes take a few days to a week before you are able to start buying/trading so starting that process now would be a good idea.

You're still good, there's no rush.

Your BTC will be totally fine.

PGP encrypted textfile inside of a veracrypt container on a clould storage site should suffice.

Yes, you have BCH now. Transfer the funds from your Exodus wallet to a new bitcoin wallet and then plug the private key or seed phrase of your original wallet into a BCH wallet (I used 'Electron Cash').

I believe so.

I honestly just want to own 0.001 bitcoin. Waiting for Gemini ID verification is the worst.

For what it's worth I got level 2 verified in &lt; 24 hours when I registered last week. I may have just gotten lucky though.

I seriously can't wait

Your BTC and BCC will both be safe in your tails + Electrum wallet -- just make sure you know your private key.

I've been researching a lot throughout the past few weeks and finally feel comfortable that I can securely hold a little BTC - I've set up a couple of wallets and now I'm just waiting on Gemini. I'm really excited to finally dive into bitcoin even though as a college student I can really only afford 0.007 right now.

Level 1 and 2 verification happened pretty much at the same time - minutes apart. I can't actually vouch for Kraken in general though because I actually ended up getting verified on Gemini later that same day so I've just been using that ever sense and haven't tried out Kraken yet.
