That was a thoroughly enjoying listen. Could you feel the tension when they offered cash or bitcoin? Lol, they played it nice a coo tho.

Holy god that was insane to watch..
Lol at 7:14..

Ah I see. I don't think the drop and Mt. Gox dump are explicitly linked, just didn't understand why all the fuss.

Ya ya, me too plz, need an ELI5...

Came here to make sure somebody made the reference. That shit makes me so sad when he can't even afford to skip...

SLC here, just used the 24 hour BTC ATM at Overstock's building in Cottonwood Heights, made me so happy. Keep up the good work mystery man!

Ya I understand how complicated it is for the general public. I've tried countless times to explain Bitcoin and blockchain tech to friends and I feel like always fall short.
Either way tho, I don't think it would need to be something ppl understand completely in order to use it. Take our current economy (U.S. Economy) for example, most ppl don't understand it on a deep level (myself included), but I know that if I drive down to the gas station and hand a lady some pieces of paper, she'll give me a soda. Seems like it would take some extensive engineering in order to build a robust system, but if ppl only had to install an app, and register, then vote, who cares if they understand whats happening behind the scenes.

Ya, I see the problems. Take a peek at my reply to somewhere on this thread for my idea on registering to vote (I know its flawed, but I'm looking at all angles).  
The database can be stored on the blockchain that anyone who is willing can download, like having the blockchain core on PC. Similar to right now if I were to check out a specific transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, although I can see the amount (or in this case, who the vote was cast for), I have no idea who made the transaction. In this way I only know which transaction is mine. Then there wouldn't really be a reason to give away which transaction (vote) was yours. 
I too can't believe that some states don't require ID.. wtf is that. The more I think about how flawed the current system is, it makes me realize how much work it would take for a VoteCoin system to work. I still think there's potential though. I mean [this]( study from January of 2017 says that 77% of Americans own a smartphone. There's got to be a way that an open source app could be developed that a user could use to register, that app checks whatever records/database are currently being checked for eligibility, then forces people to write down a 12 word passphrase and snap a scan of their retina, and that data is stored on the personal device only, but encrypted into a specific 'user hash'. Again, I'm not a pro on how this all works, even for Bitcoin, so I apologize for the rant. But ya, in the same way that manufacturers today can't produce a car without seat-belts, no new phone manufacturer could produce a smartphone without a certain resolution camera capable of highly accurate retina scans for example. I dunno, just thinking out loud here. Thanks for your input.

Wow, that sounds quite brilliant. Would it be an issue though that larger corporations and such could send a shit ton of bitcoin to only projects in their interest? It would suck to decrypt the original and just see 'Comcast, Comcast, Comcast .. '
@_date: 2017-07-19 02:55:26
No offense taken, I wasn't expecting to be a prodigy of any sort with the idea. 


I love this and truly hope it goes this way.

Lolol. 'Official Voting App only available on the Samsung GOP 7 devices sold at NRA meetings'

I was thinking about how you could prevent ppl selling their paper wallets or trading them online or whatever, and ya, it'd be feat for sure. The only thing I could come up with was some sort of biometric scan or screening process. Maybe a retina scan or fingerprint? Anyway, a paper ticket is printed from an official booth with one 'VoteCoin' and some sort of  un-brute-force-able passphrase/key/hash. You take it home, download an app on mobile or desktop, cast your vote, re-scan your retina or fingerprint, enter passphrase, submit your vote to the blockchain. That way someone could give away the wallet, but the wallet is tied to a retina scan or something. The vote couldn't be submitted until the full 'signature' containing the scan and key had been input. I'm sure people would find a way to scam the scan, but at least it'd be harder. Maybe add a third identifier thats tied to each person. I dunno. Anyway, where can I find more info about your system?

Wow, thats awesome. The thing that really got me into blockchain tech was is broad scope of use. I can't remember the exact video, but some chap was trying to explain cryptocurrency to I think a board of Canadian something or others. It was during his speech that the light bulb went on with how far out this idea could spread. Once I grasped the depth of it (and I'm sure its still 'just the tip of the iceberg'), I understood the immediate threat it plays to conventional government and the control of 'value'. Of course I naively imagined that would happen within a couple weeks, but here we are, at least 2 years later, and cryptocurrency still seems as alien to most people as well, aliens.

Whoa, this is and not right? 
I do think this is a factor tho.
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:01:15
What in the actual fuck.. this is turning into more and more of a post with every reply.
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:11:06
Ya, I only bought like $50 worth, I was (and am) a noob and decided to gamble with it at an online casino. I won a large payout (777 mBTC) and then used that to buy a chromebook on Newegg. I thought that I had spent most of it, but when I saw that value in the Bitcoin Client I got all excited. The more I think about it tho, I'm pretty sure I did spend all but a tiny bit (10 mBTC), which I did recover.  
Worst part is if I'd held on to the coin instead of bought that chromebook (was like $259.99), the coin would now be worth $2191.52..  O well, live and learn right?
@_date: 2017-06-09 17:39:21
Omg... thank you so effin much. I went through all of my receiving addresses and finally found the one with the balance. I followed the guide you posted to recover into Electrum. There was basically nothing in there, but more than none, so thank you so much! I really, really appreciate your help!
@_date: 2017-06-09 03:27:40
Which address are you talking about here? I did the --getaccountaddress ""  --  from the console, is it that address that's the main? It say's there's nothing at that address, not any even transactions..  
How can I 'resync' or 'rescan' my wallet? I really won't be mad if it ends up being empty, I just want it to be accurate. Thanks again for all the help here.
@_date: 2017-06-08 08:42:33
Can you please help me out with re-scanning/re-indexing my wallet? I'm on a Windows PC. Moderately tech savvy.  
Is like just running the client through a command line and ammending -rescan? Er..?  Thanks for your help!
@_date: 2017-06-09 08:12:05
Alright, so again, I'm a noob here, and I truly appreciate your help, but I'm getting lost somewhere...
[Here]( is a screen of my 'wallet' balance in the Bitcoin Core Client.  
I am unsure of which 'address' is tied to this wallet. I'm thinking there are multiple ones, but I'm not sure if there is like a 'main' address or what. While reading other sources online, I tried a command in the console to get addresses and it came up with these:   
  "1B49tM3qXVPzXFqj8PWRraQ5tF9mySQARB", 
  "1FTecvR9wXwQnSe2YJaCE2xPrT9tTS5Nfr", 
  "1JWz8QLCD66Z8tNEw522w1JMtAEsMkiSWj", 
  "1P1RAKNAzGJUJHobycCGcrzb1LtVeQfsi5"
When I run those through blockchain.info, the bottom two have some activity, but neither with a 'balance'. Again.. I'm so sorry if I'm overlooking something simple here, you're a trooper for stickin in out here.
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:23:18
No, the only address that had any balance only had like $15 USD in there..  still have no idea why the Bitcoin Client thinks I had that much..
