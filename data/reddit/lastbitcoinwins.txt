Very innovative and neat ideas. If it works it would certainly solve some of Bitcoins problems. The whole governance thing is a mess, seems like Dash have this solved with the voting

A small Bitcoin logo on a car going 200 mph. Will anyone even see it?
In the end, maybe we would get more exposure if we just ChangeTip´ed all the F1 drivers, mechanics, team owners etc. on their various social media accounts. All their fans would think: what the hell is this ChangeTip and then get introduced to Bitcoin in an actionable way.

F1 in Brazil tomorrow. Who´s in?
