For some reason you keep trying to find excuses and wall of text technical explanations on why the analogy isn't retarded. An analogy is meant for an average Joe.

It's that simple.

Oh noes.. Price spiked again a couple of bucks, let's spam reddit with OMG MANIPULATION OPEN YOUR EYES 
@_date: 2018-06-27 20:22:57
 the BTC mempool has been quite full in the past 24 hours, currently it's at 20MB and a bitcoin block can only confirm 1MB at a time... And on top of that the size increases continuously until there's another spree of newly discovered blocks. It might take up to 12+ more hours for your transaction to be confirmed, it all depends on its fees. 
You can't cancel it, you can only pay for your transaction to be included in the next block to some mining pool (like btc.com) but the price will most likely be huge (100$ or much more)

Actually bitfinex has deposit fees if you deposit less than 1000 usd value (fiat or crypto)
@_date: 2018-11-24 06:27:54
Because they don't give a fuck about randoms exploiting this and causing them thousands of wire transactions which don't generate any income for bitfinex, just troubles with wires overhead. So instead they're making them pay a premium if they really want to continue doing this, which is fair. Normal users are not affected by the fee

Maybe Bitcoin was dying and an excuse was needed to make it less obvious =&gt; this "war" everyone keeps talking about 
@_date: 2018-12-05 10:14:01
And then you wake up

Useless domain thx for the spam 
@_date: 2018-12-03 10:57:35
Actual problem is why would you care about the "number of subscribers"

And not being able to trade in case of a big dump / whatever

That's the level of the current people in crypto, taking advice from an actual shit wall and bragging about it on the internets
@_date: 2018-12-05 16:53:28
Stop taking advices from this guy, all he cares about is the possibility of him taking your money 
@_date: 2018-12-01 20:23:54
How can you be so gullible? All his actions and "predictions" are to benefit him, that's the definition of "smart money"

Bitfinex 
@_date: 2018-12-04 10:19:45
Fake. You spend more time trashing bit pay than complaining about losing 1500$, seems legit. Useless piece of shit 
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:48:45
There's this thing called blockchain which records ALL data...
@_date: 2018-12-05 21:58:45
Those that did won't tell you because they want the arbitrage opportunities for themselves 
@_date: 2018-12-05 22:08:27
Those "many posts" are what, tenths max? How many customers do you think bitfinex has?

Don't worry nobody will take this shit serious 
@_date: 2018-12-05 23:21:51
Price is that high because probably nobody can actually sell it &gt; gives you the false impression it's worth anything 
@_date: 2018-12-02 12:26:57
So you want to use their service and possibly endanger them (since they don't know who you are and what you are doing with the money) and when they try to take precautionary methods you call them corrupt? I'll tell you what's corrupt: your brain from all this "free inhabitant" propaganda this sub is promoting 
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:14:44
I don't think you understand what dead means

Too few random cool words, not punk enough

The exchange doesn't simply trusts your code even if it was correct earlier, it checks his own time. Also most services prevent reusing old recent 2fa codes.
@_date: 2018-12-10 14:07:44
That's just saying "I'm just guessing here I have no idea what will happen"
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:10:40
I don't own crypto, your argument is invalid

Fun fact, technically he actually donated your bags
@_date: 2018-12-18 08:43:16
This is a known scam, they're trying to dump their btc bags on you while your coins are not immediately reachable, clog the btc network and probably even profit from your transfer fees 
@_date: 2018-12-02 22:13:06
Why are you comparing trading with actual spending volume? If you want to have a comparison with Mastercard compare 10$ spent per day with bitcoin with 12$ billion spent per day with Mastercard...
Or if you really want to compare trading volume compare it to Forex which was 5$ trillion per day in 2016
@_date: 2018-12-11 18:05:03
So you want to dump your bags when nobody is expecting it 
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:37:00
If you're worrying about it going to 0 don't... Look at bitconnect, it's still worth 0.67$. If however you're worried about bitcoin going to 1$ well.. That's plausible.
I personally see it happening slowly over a couple of years, the crash scared the rest of the population, they now think "bitcoin was a bubble and scam thank God I did't get involved", they don't care about "lightning", "tps", "block sizes", "Satoshi's vision", "bakkts", etcs. Yes, there are still "believers" and people who would still use it, but that number is extremely small.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:42:37
Lets invent a new chart type which only goes up and never comes down and find an explanation to make it plausible 
@_date: 2018-12-01 21:28:03
Because you think you're smarter than him (or at least same smart as he is) thinking you will ride up together with him. You're not, he's got a hell lot more experience.
Also let me try to spell it out for you: do you see him (or others) constantly yelling "apple stocks to reach 100k by the end of year" / "tesla to get trillions of money from investors next year" / etc? No. Do you know why? Because that's straight up manipulation and regulators will fuck him up for even attempting to do it. But since crypto is not regulated he can manipulate the shit out of you and get away with it. Sad part is seeing you delusionals even congratulating him for this.

@_date: 2018-12-01 19:24:04
Haha. Seeing how "bitcoin 20k 30k 100k by the end of the year" are not working anymore, now brings in the big guns/shills and talks about TRILLIONS. And these poor delusional suckers still think that guy gives a shit about bagholders... When in reality all he wants is his bags to increase in value and hopefully dump them on the rest of the bagholders 
@_date: 2018-12-16 18:23:57
Why are you such a worthless piece of shit telling him to lose even more...?

When will you guys learn? NOBODY wants you to make money out of their goodness of their heart. You'll end up scammed 100%. No buts no ifs no maybes 
@_date: 2018-12-10 20:02:47
But how can it decrease 344%? -80%-87%-83%-94% I thought it can only decrease 100%. Is this bitcoin breaking the impossible? Bull run confirmed?
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:38:49
Wow a loophole thanks I made 13000$, thank you for letting me make free instant money from the goodness of your heart when instead you could have done it yourself
