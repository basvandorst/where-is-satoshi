I can't talk myself into buying when it's so high. Waiting for the next dip like fucking patience on a monument

100% bullshit, I thought the same thing when reading it. I don't know why people do this shit

Basically, yea. I have zero interest in using it as an actual currency

It's irrelevant to me was the point I was making. When it's low I buy and when it's high I sell. Aside from using it to bet online, that's all it's really ever going to be to me.

Exactly. They're deductible but only from your winnings, so if over the course of the year your winning bets total $10,000 and your losing bets total $7,000, you are only to pay tax on your $3,000 profit.
That was my point, that it seems like it would be very easy to simply claim losses on bets that you never made, especially if you do your gambling via offshore sportsbook online. So say for the sake of argument you won 100,000 in a given year, chose not to pay taxes, and got audited. If you send them your fabricated spreadsheet tracker with losses totaling say 80,000, you'd still have the $100,000 in your pocket but only have to pay taxes on $20,000 of it.
Like I said though, I would never actually do it myself. Just making conversation and to be honest I'm a little shocked at how seemingly bulletproof the "gambling" excuse is for tax evaders. I'm surprised I've never read about that particular maneuver actually being done

I keep a record of every bet I place on a spreadsheet...wouldn't it stand to reason that if I ever were audited I could add a few bets here and there to my spreadsheet and claim losses that never actually happened? It's not as if they can ask me for actual bet receipts from an offshore sportsbook. I would never actually do this, but it seems like a pretty simple solution to someone who wanted to avoid paying taxes

Definitely stinks of BS to me

How savvy (for lack of a better word) are they to BTC? Serious question. I ask because I've won a substantial amount betting sports online the last 4 years (tens of thousands of dollars) and have never paid a cent of taxes. Never had an issue yet. 
I never thought to much about it to be honest, not until I read this post

I use it for sports betting and I have 2.4BTC in my online account right now. Last time I bought it was at ~1250. I'm thinking of buying some as a straight investment. Is it worth buying now with the price so high? Meaning will it continue to increase or should I wait until it drops again?

Thanks. I'm definitely no expert on BTC and I was kind of expecting to get shit on for asking what I figured was a stupid question haha. I only even got involved with BTC because it's a little easier/safer for betting sports online. Never thought the value would nearly double in like 6 months
