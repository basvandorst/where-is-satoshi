That's one of those obnoxiously loud cars we see all the time here in Vancouver. Always driven by a 19 year old Chinese kid.

That's great and makes no sense without any context.. If you're going to pimp your wares you should let the potential clients (us) know which kind of widgets you're selling and why we should care about them. You're not doing well on your marketing test, mister.

Can we file as people of this good world a new patent for a Banks Custody Patent? Essentially it's a new technology we could develop that involves corrupt bankers hanging in a loosely engineered net over a pod of angry mother orcas who just lost their baby. And we could make it a show on TV and make thousands of monies.

Is there a genius plan possible where their bch becomes much more valuable? Like a plot using bitmain BTC hashing?

It's getting into the mainstream and it needs to get there to replace the systems we don't like.

The root causes of all our problems is capitalism. Its only end goal is to syphon money to the top on the backs of all life on Earth.

Well we know what bitcoinis believes about Tether. Pretty unpro to blame tether for "obviously" manipulating the market by referring to often debunked theories and studies. This is an overly flamboyant article to get clicks.

No it's $72,000. What a crazy moist cupcake. He thinks he can predict the price of Bitcoin by counting how many raisins are in him.

The banks have a ton of money and power, they will be around for a while more.. until mature crypto financial tools open up and regulations embrace them. I think one of the biggest policy questions governments will have to ask themselves soon is which side they're on. The traditional banking and money system or the new one. Either way crypto will continue being the key to financial freedom for anyone who lives in a country with corrupt governments and banks.

It's an interesting fact. If you don't care about it why are you wasting time posting and polluting our eyes?

The same people are doing the approval but the proposal is different, so.... Your point makes no sense. A lot of the issues with the ♊ proposal are addressed partly or completely by the others.

How long can this Ponzi scheme last? Can governments fix this and do they care enough to do so or will they keep kicking the can down the road?

There's no other coin. There's Bitcoin and then shitcoins* **
* Sort of, I like some projects: ETH, XMR, XLM, and a few others
** But most of the others are shitcoins with zero value as they're not really resilient or decentralized or immutable and censorship proof.

Banks might not be the right word, you're right. What I mean is the correct financial tools and structure so that we don't need banks anymore. We already don't really but for the majority a lot of maturing needs to happen.

Nope. Even s9 are barely worth it.
