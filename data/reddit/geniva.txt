It seems like making segwit optional was the mistake.

One thing I’ve been trying to understand: Bitcoin uses proof of work to verify transactions on the main chain. Lightning sounds like a side chain of transactions that ultimately get written back onto the main chain. How are transactions that occur within this layer verified/confirmed within lightning? Also, when this becomes a thing, will addresses be cross-compatible ala segwit, or would lightning transactions only occur through the use of a different wallet/app? What happens if someone attempts to send Bitcoin to a lightning address from a normal wallet and vice-versa?

Transfer from Coinbase to GDAX (same company, just link account on GDAX). Then withdraw BTC from GDAX to Bitwallet. GDAX covers the transaction fee.

Overall it seems to me the broad technical implication of the lightning network is a potential future where nothing has to be written on the main blockchain, since everything is in lightning channels. Lots of people seem to feel secure with how lightning network can verify transactions across multiple parties within the network without using proof of work. Am I misunderstanding something? Is it just because it’s multisig? If this is all that’s needed to secure transactions, why have a blockchain or proof of work at all?

I really feel that if you’re a little shop selling things for under $100 and want to accept Bitcoin, you simply have to accept the risk of a zeroconf transaction (but refuse RBF!)
It’s the same thing as risking counterfeit money when accepting cash. Until the Lightning Network is functioning, it’s really the only way to provide a decent experience to your customers.
Also, if said shop isn’t comfortable with maintaining their own wallet... they shouldn’t be accepting Bitcoin.

If Coinbase is as large as they say, wouldn’t most of the money end up in the original BTC chain anyways (since they’re calling it BTC to start)? After a period of time the miners would surely get tired of not making money and switch back, no? I guess it depends on how long Coinbase sits back and watches.
