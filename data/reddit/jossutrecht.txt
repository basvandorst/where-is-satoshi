when you really want or need something you can pay with bitcoin and it doesn't cost more than the "profit" you've made with it.
Always spend the dividend and no the principle.

its what 13 year olds use to sound cool because 35 year olds on 4chan use to say 6 years ago.

you didn't buy a $230 vacuum, you bought a $500 vacuum cleaner. Don't buy with it during a time of outrageous fluctuations. use an alt coin for small purchases.

It is a non zero number though. The difference between an s3 and s9 is large but not so large that thousands of s3's mining intermittently wouldn't produce results. 
The idea of the charity pool I guess is the key focus here, not using older miners. 
I've also considered that using older miners as space heaters as part of HVAC solutions is a thing. Heating green houses... why not just point them to a charity pool?

Instead of buying bitcoin outright, rent miners from nicehash and mine at slush or another reputable pool with lower numbers.
As a community, we need to develop a donation/charity pool. Point old unprofitable hardware at this pool when you have the extra funds...  The charity pool may take any block rewards and donate them to childrens hospital, red cross, or buying of medical debt like that one company was doing a while back. 
There are javascript miners setup to mine monero. That might work great for a charity so people with limited hardware could donate cpu power to a good cause.
This charity pool could help solve the 51%  problem slightly but lower the barrier to helping people in need!

technically gold and silver will always be a bubble. in times of extreme famine gold value plummets as people trade it in for food. 
people can and should feel the same way about bitcoin as they do about gold because they're both commodities that have a that are limited in quantity. scarcity is what make a bubble recover.

buy litecoin.

It is a currency. Money transmition laws apply. Trading Euro for Yen falls under the same regulation as trading bitcoin and USD.

I believe most Nigerians speak English. Most of their professionals that can will work on the internet for bitcoin. They do not need exchanges. They do not need fiat. They will trade their work for bitcoin.

Bitcoin is also in its infancy. We are talking about 10k a bitcoin like it is a lot. I personally believe it will be 1 million or more within 10 years and it is believed that the wild swings in price will stop as it becomes more mature. 
Bitcoin is a payment system that is being used as an investment tool. If you got de weak hands don't hodl. I got mine squirreled away because I believe.

If they have the internet I imagine a lot of people in that country are going to find themselves working remote for bitcoin.
