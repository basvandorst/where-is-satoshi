groovy, thx
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:24:45
Yea, let's just wait for the biggest bombshell announcement in Bitcoin history and do maintenance on our site the day the entire world want's to trade feverishly.

We'll be doing interviews from the conference floor - check out cointalk.ca for more!

This is a valid point of discussion, and you're right - there is not a lot of information on how change works - It will be added to the FAQ section today :) 
For those looking for a simplified answer. Change is generated in the digital space like change is generated in the real world. If I charge you 5 dollars and you pay with a 10 dollar bill, you can't simply cut the 10 dollar bill in half. You need to find two five-dollar bills. 
And so the way this is handled digitally is that a new wallet address is created to do the split, 5 is transferred out to me, and 5 is transferred to a new address. As such, these offline wallets are designed for cold storage, if you need to move and spend the funds you have saved on them, it should be done by sending the whole wallet's value to a new address.

Just wanted to chime in here - the guys at  have amazing BIP38 encrypted (user chosen password) laser etched aluminium offline wallets, they also have a FAQ page to help. But basically you can order a card from their site with bitcoin, in the currency of your choosing. For the most part it's a standard Paper Wallet - only it's waterproof, and flameproof up to 600 celsius so it adds more durability. The aluminium they use is rated to last up to 75 years and you can pick cool colors yadda yadda.. Anyways though, they're pretty slick, I have a few myself and if you search for cryptocards on reddit you can read their reviews :)
EDIT: You generate your own encrypted keys and upload - so they don't have access to your funds in case you were wondering, it's a trustless system.
@_date: 2014-01-16 15:35:15
These are essentially cold storage offline wallets, they have 3 primary purposes.
People who have no offline wallet solution can generate an offline wallet and send the BIP38 encrypted private key and public key to Crypto Cards to have it laser etched and sent out.
1) Once the user has the card, they can send funds to the wallet and keep it in a physically secure location, these will never fade, crumple, rust, corrode or sustain water or flame damage (up to 600C/1200F in the case of fire)
2) Crypto Cards offers public key only cards that you can safely carry in your wallet and take out to scan and accept payment at any time, best of all the funds accepted to the address are sent and stored directly offline.
3) If the time comes that client wants to spend the funds, they can simply decrypt the wallet and import the private key into any wallet they prefer - and there are a number of solutions available on the market today. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:29:33
These do not have 'spend' functionality per se - they are used as an offline point of fund storage. If you are looking for something with Debit/Credit similar functions you should look up CoinKite (coinkite.com) and other alternatives. 
However, you can definately carry a public key around to receive funds - It's cool to be able to whip it out and have your friends send you funds they owe you with just a scan.

sidebar: Begging/asking for bitcoins is absolutely not allowed, no matter how badly you need the bitcoins. Only requests for donations to large, recognized charities are allowed, and only if there is good reason to believe that the person accepting bitcoins on behalf of the charity is trustworthy.

I love the interface - please write an android app! There's nothing like this for android but on ios7 but I've switched to android and feel outta luck :(

Hey there! In fact we've been having trouble with our podcast - were gonna be fixing that tonight :)

Smoke Bourbon utilizes the CoinKite POS and so you can pay with Bitcoin smart card (debit style). Requires account at Coinkite.com
@_date: 2014-03-12 03:55:32
interesting :)
@_date: 2014-02-11 20:01:38
Hahaha it was easy :) We should do more stuff like this for your movement!
@_date: 2014-02-11 17:55:06
see:  down for about 3hrs so far...
A user posted "Their twitter account twitter.com/blockchain has stated "Due to a large DDOS attack the datacenter has null routed our IP addresses during the night. Servers themselves are fine." - But I don't actually see that in the twitter...
Also, reports are saying wallet apps on phones etc can't send funds...
EDIT: Their twitter (twitter.com/blockchain) says: "PingdomAlert DOWN:   ( ) is DOWN since 02/11/2014 05:49:30PM."
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:09:08
Nope, unless something fishy is going on, but I don't wanna freely speculate - their twitter says they are gonna be back soon... Let's hope - I have trading to do and i got cut off right in the middle and its costing me

@_date: 2014-05-12 05:42:40
how much is a bit these days? how many satoshi's? sorry bits is new slang as far as I can tell...
@_date: 2014-05-12 17:48:39
trying to get some bits to get friends involved

My favourite part is when he says something along the lines of "You want to redistribute the wealth - that's not gonna happen" - What a tool...

I empathize and wouldn't trust a 3rd party either, this has been a big problem for Casascius as they mint non-encrypted private keys and there was some fallout over how users can know the funds aren't compromised. 
To bypass this, and in fact add an additional security layer, Crypto Cards doesn't take any non-encrypted private keys. All orders placed must be encrypted BIP38 keys, which means without the encrypted passphrase, they have no way of accessing the funds. 
As a secondary precaution, and even through BIP38 is designed to be impenetrable, Crypto Cards doesn't ever share your BIP38 Encrypted Private keys and encourages you not to either. Additionally, once you order has shipped they purge all information regarding the order immediately from the server.

while I agree with you - it seems this is more targeted to people outside the subreddit since it invites them - seeing this on the front page of reddit as a non-bitcoiner would encourage me to start reading - it's direct and to the point...

I just wanted to chime in and say that I've seen these baby's up close and personal. The build quality is pretty remarkable, they're made out of steel, painted like race cars and anyone who's used a 'traditional' ATM is gonna feel right at home here... very exciting! Anyone who has the evening free should head out to Bitcoin Decentral at 7pm to get a better look.
@_date: 2016-06-21 18:01:05
Hey Bro! I was in the same boat :) Probably was even at that party with ya
@_date: 2015-11-14 18:58:22
I like how you bypassed that middle d :P
@_date: 2016-05-02 22:36:37
It's not just a shower thought, it's what's actually happening. Wish I could say more

There is no official github, or place for the source code, but if you download the file from the google web store, then just append .zip to it, and open it using a zip opener it should show you all the source code.
@_date: 2013-12-27 04:17:26
Check out an interview I did where we live demo'd the features and talked the the creator about the technology involved!
More, including live coverage of the Inside Bitcoins conference is available at cointalk.ca
I don't wanna get spammy but we're the new kids on the block and are trying to get the word out that we're providing useful insight and this is pretty related :D
Feedback is welcome too! and donation addresses are at the bottom of the video links :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:36:50
There are export options for paper/brainwallet features, as well as a kryptokit export option that produces a .json file that can be copied to a new device. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 06:15:39
check out cointalk.ca or go to youtube and search cointalk I have a show where we look at things like this, episode 6 is particularly good I think :)
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:17:49
Thanks! I'm trying - I'd love to do them full time but while I work 9-5 it's tough, the next episode will be out Friday (Hopefully morning) and the episode to follow is a big one!

Hey there! My name is Kyle and I was an attendee at the conference, I've also had the opportunity to run the kyrptokit beta for some time now and I had Anthony Diorio on an HD video show that I produce called CoinTalk. (cointalk.co)
So to answer your question, there's been a lot of concern about the nature of online wallets and the fact that as online wallets inflate with deflationary bitcoin value, they become more a prime target for hackers. 
Here's how Kryptokit is a little bit different:
There is no Kryptokit server, so in a sense, the entire app is stored client side, you can choose to put a password on the app that will allow prevent others from spending the wallet funds without it. The password will also prevent the GPG keys from being exported. As Kryptokit functions client side - there is no data being exchanged in the cloud. All transactions are made from client to vendor and Kryptokit is the fastest most effective way to enable client-vendor payments without the need for sloppy copy paste functions. If anyone wants to see Kryptokit in action or is curious about taking a guided tour - feel free to check out this video online -  - I'll also answer any questions anyone has while I wait in the airport to head back from Inside Bitcoins Las Vegas! :)
@_date: 2013-12-24 08:24:56
I don't know about famous YouTuber's and whether or not they would be interested in accepting bitcoin - But I can tell you that I have started an HD Video Podcast and could really use some help with donations IF the community likes what I'm up to... 
We've had a few really difficult setbacks recently with damaged gear via careless baggage handlers at the airport meanwhile I'm trying to leave my day job and be a part of the crypto revolution, baby steps I suppose.... :P
In any case, I hate to solicit donations, there's always some sort of weird guilt thing for me... None the less, check out our website -  - it's more important to me that we help grow the community and if you like bitcoin interviews and news and such we got ya covered :)
tl;dr - check out cointalk.ca and if you like it, feel free to help us stay alive :)

@_date: 2013-12-25 09:44:23
I did an interview with the executive director - Ron Gross - while I was at the 'Inside Bitcoins' conference, you can check it out here, it may help to clarify some things... 
@_date: 2013-12-13 04:41:58
The kryptokit code is open source and available for audit by anyone. :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:48:42
Firefox is currently in the works I believe... The exciting thing about kryptokit is that it's done a large chunk of what dark wallet wants to do - only its available now :P
