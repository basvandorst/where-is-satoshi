Well, that depends. Maybe you see an error message. Or maybe the opening of the channel fails. Or the client disconnects unexpectedly. If you expend some effort to investigate or fix it yourself and still nothing, you should report it. It could be a bug, or it could be bad UX. Both should and can be fixed.
I will give you an example of the bug I found: When I tried to close the channel, in some cases the channel would close only on one side and not the other and the logs contained an error message that the signature was invalid (see

You would be right if the ETF was holding Bitcoin. But the proposed ETFs will be based on the Proshares long and short futures fund.

No. It's a high voltage unicode emoji:

It looks like it will be an ETF based on futures. Not everyone can trade the futures, but if the ETF is listed on NYSE everyone in the world with regular broker account will be able to trade this. Same as the futures, the impact on Bitcoin price should not be significant, as the fund will not actually hold Bitcoin. 
I'd be actually quite curious how they will ensure the liquidity, as the futures themselves have quite low volume now and there has to be a seller for every buyer.
Anyway, the impact is probably more along the lines "Bitcoin is here to stay and should be taken seriously". It's probably also a step in the right direction for the actual Bitcoin ETF, that will hold Bitcoin (ie. what the Winklevii are trying to push), as the SEC named the lack of derivatives as one of the reasons for not approving it (yet).

That's the spirit :)

I have not, thank you. But it is not very comprehensive. I just don't understand the motivation of the seller here and that is what interests me.

As I wrote, if you believe in the asset, it does not matter if it goes even insanely lower for a while. It might. It might also immediately bounce back. This of course does not mean you should ignore other sane investment advice such as diversification.
@_date: 2014-01-11 21:46:34
Good point, makes sense, that is one way to get it there. But is it enough? Probably not.
@_date: 2014-08-18 15:52:03
This should teach you: Always have some limit buy orders open at insanely low prices. If the asset (BTC, stock, currency, commodity, whatever) is something you believe will go up long-term, be ready to buy when the price is good, not when you are sitting at your computer. These things happen in all markets.
@_date: 2014-01-11 22:32:19
yes, but... OK, you got me there. Apparently, it is the same as with the dollar, one might argue that Bitcoin is better, so probably the premium will be even higher. Let's hope there is enough supply to satisfy local demand.
@_date: 2014-01-11 22:11:01
That's what I thought, but if you count in the potential for Bitcoin appreciation and the peso depreciation, it would have to be one hell of a premium. Which beats the "preserve value" purpose a little. Thanks for your comment, though.

Updated my node. Thanks to the core team.

Nod FUD here. Bank notes were originally backed by gold and they offered significantly better UX than gold itself and allowed the economy to flourish. The article argues lightning may have similar effect on bitcoin, ie. provide better UX while keeping the essential properties of bitcoin.

It's Euro, so the exchange rate is fine. The surcharge is the problem.
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:22:37
It'd definitely payable from any Bitcoin wallet.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:00:50
It's additional. I have to pay a standard transaction fee as well, of course. And I am sure they also charge Valve some commission, same as credit card processor would. Overall, the 17 EUR price for the game became 21 EUR with all the fees.

It's cool and all, but I have a hard time believing a piece of software, that is supposed to handle money, downloaded over plain HTTP. 
Please, Coinffeine team, do something about it. Thanks.

@_date: 2019-02-25 06:14:28
I know. So bitcoin+lightning is much better than gold+notes. I argue that the EFFECT will be similar - ie. much higher usage and adoption.
@_date: 2018-11-27 18:37:11
I just hope they go with Lightning. Paying for coffee on-chain makes zero sense and will be too expensive to be practical. But good PR, I guess.

I am afraid the list will be pretty short for the moment. I know only about Electrum wallet. No exchange supports it. Heck, most of them don't even provide P2SH-P2WPKH (starting with 3) addresses for incoming transfers. 
But hopefully now that Core will have support, it will start to appear more, because many exchanges use a Core node on the backend I suppose.

I know that not your keys - not your Bitcoin. On the other hand, lending and borrowing is a necessary financial instrument and I think there is space for this kind of service. I am curious if anyone has experience with them. If you plan to hodl, earning interest sounds really good. Almost too good to be true, in fact.

Yea, but it seem quite old, so I guess any reasonable antivirus which is updated regularly would catch it if you tried to run it. Not that I tried. What I am wondering is, how they got my address. I do have an account (inactive) at itBit, so I am little suspicious as to where they got it.
@_date: 2015-02-12 21:25:12
So I ran it thru ESET again, and it was identified as Java/Adwind.AC trojan. Don't know why it did not pick it up at first.

I see I deleted that particular mail already, but I have another one, which has different email content, but basically is the same, the .rar looks similar. DISCLAIMER FOR OTHERS: Do not download this file unless you know what you are doing. There you go:

The file is .rar, which contains a .jar. All I know is it tries to run regedit.exe on windows. ESET did not recognize it as a virus, so it probably only downloads the malware later to pass email filters.

It would be cool, if it was actually broadcasting entire blockchain. Which it's currently not. AFAIK it's just broadcasting new blocks as they are mined, but you still need to obtain the whole history by some other channel. And if you miss few blocks because of power loss, you are out of luck. I really like the idea, but it needs more bandwidth and block rebroadcasts to be useful. Just my 5 cents.

Cool, thanks for clarifying, it should protect against some outages. The need to somehow get the initial state remains, though. Would be interested to read about your experience with it.
