digital assets taking over the world and every aspect of data, data service and data storage implementing  blockchain .
btc is what brought forth blockchain/ crypto so as long as it remains secure, it will have value. Tbh it’s way better than gold and a really ingenious interplanetary financial system. Even if you wouldn’t utilize it like cash, for sov it can last for the millennias to come

You can pick points, they arent arbitrary...i think there is a 94-96% chance if you invest in btc its positive gains (throughout its history).
Not only that, "highs" that were hit, were only highs for a few hours. Comparing against a 20k high that was held for like 16 hours is arbitrary. If you look at yearly lows, btc SOV becomes clearly evident. 


This is evidence that you are speaking out your ass. In 2017, coinbase was having like 100k new users per day (off top, i know source will show high evidence of new users). 


Lmfaooo. 0% correct. Single central points are factors more prone to manipulation.


Its literally a 100b market cap, internet money. Fintech praises its innovation and most governments have held inquires or currently undergoing new regulations to better assimilate this new technology. So yeah everything you said was subjective and baseless.

this is a false negative and has nothing to do with bitcoin and how economies and technology works.
 your analogy is based off a single central entity  acquisition that has  an understood model which is capped at numerical value 1, which is fundamentally incompatible to a decentralized open access system. 
For example, if you were to use this analogy in a monogamous society it would hold true and the numbers would continue to increase as long as the constitute properties remain (resources+desire)

okay your right you didn’t say that, but it seems like you are implying btc wouldn’t work because some other system is better.  
What system makes more sense than btc (+and blockchain/crypto) for the future? 
Realistically our current financial systems will crumble to blockchain and cryptocoins and btc is the leader and pioneer of blockchain and this new system. 
As long as btc doesn’t get hacked, this will be the backbone base currency of the future, even if newer faster currencies come along. BTC will be accepted everywhere even if other (crypto)currencies move the majority of the micro-transactions.

the delay is inconsequential as the criteria is efficiency and reliability(safety). Arguing the time delay is off topic as the discussion is planetary markets; are they transacting in a countries current fiat system or blockchain/crypto based solution. Fiat usd doesn’t hold up overtime due to its inflation and a variety of its current flaws including why politically other countries would with modern circumstances accept usd (or any one particular countries currency) to be the interplanetary means of transacting 
But if your best argument why btc wouldn’t work is because time delay then explain why usd or other fiat  would ? Also, what does a miner have to do with overcoming bitcoins immutability ? Would money printed in usdollars on planet earth make more sense to use for colonization on mars than btcs system? That essentially must be your argument, that the current system is better (than bitcoins) and makes more sense practically. 
Mars economy couldn’t be entirely independent until they had established themselves and establishment has to come from some type of already organized system. You are saying colonists will openly opt to use usd or yen rather than a decentralized, non sovereign, immutable, reliable interplanetary exchange value system. Okayy
@_date: 2019-02-07 06:55:24
it does provide value. 
Value is different from revenue. The internet is incredibly valuable but doesn’t directly produce revenue. 
If humans could have direct access to the internet via an ownership type of methodology, people would soon realize something can be valuable without producing revenue (company ). 
Bitcoins value is produced in being a borderless, secure, censorship resistant, immutable, open access, mathematically sound system of money and SoV which actually  has a ton of value (just like usd has value or euro has value but doesn’t directly produce anything )
@_date: 2019-02-07 12:34:17


The argument for email over snail mail is “efficiency” , which encapsulates speed which is what your referencing by instant(i think). The efficiencies of bitcoin and cryptos can outperform current systems.


This is a misconstrued analysis. Yes there is truth that exchanges have been completely shady and thieving, but that’s just because the system was new not that the system is bad. Banks too have issues of insolvency and are often knee deep in fraud. Your also suggesting exchanges can’t be regulated or offer insurance on your money, which they can be and some already are.
Banks are constantly fined for theft of customer accounts and illicit practices. 


It’s good your open to reasoning. When we colonize mars and start to ponder about cross planetary systems, do you think we will use us denominations? 
Including the fact that  robots are going to start operating in our economies and trading alongside of us, does it make sense the usd  will be the primary currency, which due to quantitative easing is destined to lose 97% of its value in the next 100 years?
The reason why we went from horses to cars is due to efficiency. No matter how much sally the horse was part of the family, the automobile came into prominence even thou it were mechanically loud, dirty, complex and prone to issues without abundant roads and the reason we developed that technology and left the security of the horse was simply because the system was better, its way more efficient.
The thing is, you don’t even have to take my word for it most prominent financial institutions openly state digital assets is the future of the world

we can change the numerical value but in terms of usa denomination as time progresses this terminology  will not be used and it becomes obsolete. As interplanetary communication and settlements take place usd won’t be the dominant currency  and in the far future goods around the solar system will probably be referenced in terms of satoshi.
So quadtrillion and even septillion is a possibly conceivable number. Just one century ago a millionaire was a big deal and a billion dollars business would of been amongst the pinnacle, while today we have single companies that were valued at 1T . So trillion dollars is already worked into how our economy operates. And given time, growth, expansion and logic it makes sense an easy interplanetary system like btc and the emerging crypto’s will be dominate versus the current usd banking financial structure of quantitative easing. This will take time to unfold but it’s already rolling along and within the next 10 years as everyone holds btc as a storage of value it’s going to hit 1 million usd each. In 200 years when usd means nothing then “i’ll trade you for 5 satoshi” will become prominent. 
Until then we’ll still talk in terms of bitcoin and usd. 
@_date: 2019-02-22 17:09:35
1 mil btc makes logical sense for a variety of reasons.

That only is technically right but we can quickly notice the world isn’t run by kingdoms anymore. 
When the world runs with a system with everyone being a chief, or rather everyone having a voice, we get a much more advanced, complex, robust economy and society.
See democracy vs monarchy which essentially comes down to your argument. The kings would of argued not everyone can have a voice and they are wrong. 
When we integrate systems with (a more ) equal distribution of power, economy and tech actually booms(see history). 
This is replicated within btc network with nodes being open access and each node being given equal voting power. So every human, or node, can be a chief in the same way that democracy allows for that position .
In true hierarchy’s, like monarchy, innovation and technology always moves at snail pace due to how that system is designed.
So systems with everyone being a chief are already apart of our world , and have made the world a “better” place in very significant ways. 
BTC is like switching from a monarchy to a democracy and if we look at the history of the world, technology (and knowledge) booms directly after any incorporation of democracy (see golden age, see technology since 1776 ). 
Our monetary system is still based on a monarchy style rule ( fiat) . Our monetary system now can be based off democracy (decentralization).  The last time the world shifted society from monarchy to democracy (post 1776) the world changed rapidly. Notice the last 200 years looks nothing like the prior 5,000 of civilization ? So the freeing of our monetary system from fiat to decentralization will have an equal economic boom in terms of wealth and prosperity being created for the entire world. [Poverty or rather destitution will be eliminated]
And usa moved off gold standard due to corruption and greed. Gold is also much more speculative (incomplete information ) than btc.

what’s outlandish is Draper predicted bitcoin would hit $10,000 in 2017.. when the price was $412 (2014).
How many people would honestly say that  was a reasonable prediction?
I think Draper gets it on the money. If you look at how fast smart phone technology took over the world and the resulting efficiency on how quickly something can go viral, current economics and crypto’s vibrant use case (almost every aspect of living our lives will incorporate a crypto or blockchain) will have trade transactions with cash settlements become obsolete relatively quickly. 
It’s not like you’ll “kind of use cash”, once this industry is robust enough using cash would be like using dial up.  I also don’t think he means it’s literally 5 years for 100% adoption, but 5 years for the trend to be so apparent denying it would be like denying the total adoption of the internet.  Yes small pockets don’t utilize it but, but let’s be real and say it covers the world. 
 But there are going to be a variety of reasons of why cash phases out, including easily accessible discount offers via crypto payments  and the normalcy of storage of your own personal funds on blockchains. 
People will soon be taking all their job compensation payments into directly deposited  crypto or atleast stable backed coins. Businesses, industries, all of society is going to mass migrate onto blockchain. 
Once it starts, it will quickly “viral” and this will be the normal way of the world, as quickly(this a metaphor) as smartphones became ubiquitous.   
5 years for the take over is not unreasonable.

What’s going on is as different as sending a letter via post vs email . The only difference is instead of going physical to digital we are going digital to digital 2.0.
The exact argument your making for the superior upgrade of technology of email over postal service can be used for btc+crypto’s over the current system.
When email first arrived people didn’t understand why it would naturally take over(efficiency).  Crypto is a more efficient secure and incentivizing than our current system by a magnitude of the email to the postal letter. 
Your money in a bank right now can be frozen at any time, it loses value at ~2.5% per year, except you don’t know how much money is being printed, it’s not an open and honest system, and when you examine how it functions it’s  a nosedive over time, to transfer your wealth around the globe can take a few intermediaries with medium to significant fees. This is just in the currency sector . You don’t have easy open access to a liquid “reserve” investment (like gold) , at best you can get is a paper ticket of a “we promise this is real.” If you do buy actual gold, storage and transportation then reveal themselves to be encumbersome. This isn’t even to mention verifying the gold in the first place to make sure it is pure and how much cost and time that would take. And then imagine the horror of tradings items with actual pieces ? Or you can use a system that supplants all of this at the same time.
Besides for all of this, your coming from the vantage point of someone who has the best setup on earth(First world country). 2/3 of the planet don’t have access to reliable banking or identification (did I mention identification on blockchain would mitigate the majority of immigration processing ? ) nor do most  people around the world have fair ways of exchanging value. Imagine using the governments money in a dictatorship or a country under a corrupt government that prints $$$ without recall vs using bitcoin system which you can verify any transaction yourself. 
There’s about 10 million more things that can be said but to keep it short a credit card company has to charge a business  3-4% to process a payment.  Due to how cryptocurrencies are designed you can have value exchanged at a much healthier percentage, say 1% fees. A credit card company can’t survive on 1% profits to keep their lights on and the ceo paid but a coin can afford its network and be sustainable with 1% profits, because of how cryptos are structured.

as I stated, it doesn’t matter how nice I talked to you. I could of brought your favorite peanuts and a soda pop.
It doesn’t matter cause your *mentality*, in regards to financial wealth, is to argue first why you can’t*
So rather than writing an elaborate letter, or poem, signifying all the ways you are wonderful
I’d rather just say :
youre broke because of your mentality.
If you start to respond, then my debate is on why this statement contains truth.
Instead, where do you take the topic ? :
-1.Oh if you would of only told me nice
-2. Oh i’m going to leave this conversation 
-3. Your an asshole 
-4. Your young and don’t understand the importance of “niceness” in being an effective communicator
essentially, I would of listened BUT.
Notice you never debate the validity of the statement?
Notice how whenever you or someone else called me something, the first thing I wanted to do was debate the validity of what was said? Not concerning myself with how “‘nice” or “hurtful “ the thing said is ??

What he says has nothing to do with your bitcoin investment opportunity.
If you want to be rich, go make moves instead of complaining.
I bet if Draper lost all his fortune, based on his mentality he could make a new fortune.That’s the thing, there are people who will make money no matter what. And there are those who will be broke no matter what. 
And it all comes down to mentality
(If your a quadriplegic or hit with a life ending disease you obviously are exempt)
Realistically if your a healthy person (all your limbs work, your not bed ridden, your cognitive abilities are normal)
AND your in America
being broke or ending up financially secure is on you. 
Again, what Draper says has 0 to do with your financial opportunity in investing in bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-04-12 20:45:18
1) that’s not how projecting works 
2) You dismissing someone’s *valid statement* due to their personal wealth is a complaint, and the fact that you can’t recognize it as such is a good indication you are, indeed, in that mental space of someone who is broke. 
I guarantee not one person who started off in rags and turned it to riches would say “yeah well that’s easy for him to say cause he’s already wealthy”.
If you know better, you wouldn’t say something as silly, and unimportant as this comment.
My point is someone who is wealthy, or who is going to be wealthy wouldn’t say something like that. 
Just by your comment I can tell your already broke and will be broke in 20 years (if you keep thinking like this).

the average person has poor financial understanding. Is it because they can’t learn? 
No, they just don’t find it important enough. They don’t prioritize their financial health. They calculate everything and they say that’s the least most important thing. They also set their priorities up differently. So getting tv, or coffee, or that snack is an okay expense  as they state  “i don’t have money to invest”  . 
How many people say they can’t afford investing because of bills, and these bills are getting an iphone 7 instead of using an iphone 2 for another 2 years. Or getting multiple subscriptions? 
1 year goes by and they have the same “bills” , and still no investment. *Investing is a mentality*. 
The average person goes heavily into debt to support a lifestyle to impress other people. 
*You may not think it’s a reality* , 
but that’s only because of your mentality, but you could cost cut and live a very frugal life for a period of time as you stack money to invest, so that in the future you have financial wealth.
Gary V makes a good point - you CAN live in a car for 6 months, or a shelter, stack your money and make moves. But that’s a lot of hard, ugly work.

There are people who, no matter what, can figure out how to make money.
it doesn’t come down to education or family wealth, but one thing: mentality

It’s not my job to be nice to you either, i’m simply telling you some shit. If you don’t want to believe it, that’s your life and your business. 
I’m telling you, *this is the mentality in effect.*
When i was broke , if someone said “you are poor because _____” I listened to FIX, rather than to make a counter argument.
No matter what I said,  you already are going to counterargue it. I could of sat you down and patted your back while giving you a coke with your favorite straw to sip from , but *because of your mentality you would find SOME argument as to why someone is wrong to call you poor*.

Lol i don’t care if you call me insane, as you can probably tell, I won’t feel like your pushing anything in my face and choose to turn away. 
Cause I don’t think disagreement or confrontation is the main point of contention, but rather why is it we disagree .
You called me crazy and my first response is to identify what’s been said/done that’s crazy ?
I call you broke and your first response is to say I am talking to you like an asshole and you don’t want to continue the conversation.
If you called me broke, I would say point it out. Same thing with insane. If I truly hold a flawed position, i’ll correct it rather than complain about how that correction is advised.
I’m responding not because I need something, but because I want to. I could care less what he does.
But i’ll tell you what - if we were to debate the truth of the subject, as we have been ... why are you so quick to run from debating the topic? Why are you so quick to be offended how the topic is discussed? 
You know why? Because you have a weak position on it.
you can’t comfortable stand in your own belief because the attacks on it are just too painful , because ultimately they contain too much truth.
Otherwise you would have a better defense then “you don’t know me, well if you talked nicer, well you must be young, well you know what this conversation is done your an asshole/insane “

dude you are so wrong.
First - golds utility is definitely not worth 7T
gold has most of its value from aesthetics - people like to wear gold , and as a society we value it as something valuable to have. It’s use case? Relative 
it’s so hilarious to see people say gold has intrinsic value when gold is used primarily as jewelry. What’s the utility case of jewelry ? Not survivability but simply human endearment.
The thing gold is used for most is ultimately to look nice.. which isn’t necessary for surviving .
Gold is used in TRACE amounts in electronics and orthodontics, definitely not worth 7Trillion as a utility though.
For bitcoin you then go on to confuse the fact that something has to be tangible to be valuable. Because your train of thought is like a barbarian, what would be valuable if “society” were to collapse ? This metal because I can smash people with it and defend myself( in true crash of society anarchy would reign and no one is looking to collect gold in a lawless state of existence when people can just rob for free). 
Rather the better question is what’s more valuable to society - gold as a physical item or a system of connection. 
It’s like, what do we use more and holds more value to us in civilization - gold or the internet ? I can’t touch the internet, build directly with internet, make the internet into a weapon and defend myself with it or kill anything to provide food for myself with the internet. The internet can’t clothe me or keep me warm or build a shelter with. What’s important in tribe based living is different from what’s important in an advanced society.
Do people really think gold is more valuable to humans than the internet ?
Absolutely it isn’t.
“Systems” can be more valuable than things. You would rather have a rock or metal if you have to fight someone in 1v1 combat, but if you wanted to build - math (a system) is way more valuable. So in a fight, understand you will select a metal. But to build? Knowledge is more valuable. Knowledge is also intangible. 
Soon people will realize bitcoin does everything gold does, except better. The only thing bitcoin doesn’t have is its tangible. But as discussed with the internet or with math, or knowledge, there are intangible systems which values outstrip a metal rock. By far.
Transferring bitcoin is 10,000 times easier than transferring gold.
Accepting and verifying bitcoin is 10,000 times easier than accepting and verifying gold.
Moving bitcoin, storing bitcoin.
What’s easier to rob - an individual carrying gold or an individual “carrying”  btc. What’s easier to travel with ? What’s easier to store in a safe location that can be accessed by only those you give the keys  to. If someone tells you the gold they have is authentic, it takes time and resources to verify this to be true. I can “inherently” know the bitcoin i receive is a bitcoin. That’s what inherent means, gold has almost no “inherent” value(definitely not worth 7trillion). Also bitcoin “inherently” tracks its own transfers - something you can’t do with gold- which adds even more security and validity 
Remember, the bitcoin system has never been hacked - only the exchanges and outside forces have.
So bitcoins worth is in the system it provides. The security, ease of access, ease of validity, ease of transfer, ease of exchange, ease of ownership, ease of decentralization, ease of immutability, ease of storage 
. 
On top of all this, golds supply is unknown. Additionally, we know there is magnitudes of gold in different places , other planets and even our own sea waters which we just currently can’t extract. As tech improves we will be able to extract this and then essentially gold will be as common as aluminum. Gold is a decently terrible way to store wealth once interstellar traveling begins.
So yeah. btc &gt; gold. But i mean , you can touch gold .. which is nice

incorrect. They might tell you they don’t care, but every major bank has divested r&amp;d into blockchain/btc, most notably jaime dimon, ceo of J.P. morgan publicly saying btc is a fraud while opening trading desks behind close doors. 
Also, per Kelly Loeffler,  ceo of bakkt, created by ICE, the largest exchange in the world, the banking managers of most prominent banks in the world have been meeting and coming to agreement on digital asset regulation. This regulatory guideline is currently sitting on the desks of US congress

oh nice. So you are aware of what the banks are investing in ?
You know some banking ceos and they tell you this ?
Because banking officials, ceos, financial analysts, traders, etc, money people .. I don’t know them personally but i’ve definitely seem enough of their videos and speeches to know they are interested in the tech and are also purchasing btc. 
Saying digital assets are the futures and then discussing btc (and crypto) as a new tradable asset class = interest in bitcoin. Bakkt is literally built around btc , and bakkt is developed by the largest exchange in the world. And again as the ceo of bakkt says her self, she has already talked with executives of all the largest banks who have agreed on how regulation to trade btc shall go forward. Working with bank ceos to trade bitcoin specifically is definitely counter to your claim that banks don’t care. Also if you think blockchain will survive but btc won’t means you are missing the new “digital economy” picture. 
Unless you happen to “know “ all these bankers on a personal level ur talking about ? 
and are aware of their investment portfolios ? 
You’ve been talking to banking officials on your weekends ?
or are you just talking out ur ass ? Because i can almost guarantee you’re talking out your ass and making assumptions

Who has outperformed who ? 
Btc has way more gains than brk.. you know this right?
10k$ investment in BRK in 1964 would be worth 240 million dollar at end of 2017 ***
10k $ investment in BTC in 2010, at its current price would be worth 630 million. At the end of 2017? closer to 3 billion. 
Please explain to me how BRK and buffet have outperformed BTC.
by the way , btc has had 46 years less time on the market than brk, or roughly 17% of the time.!
I’ll wait. 
By Buffett's own estimates, if he had simply accepted the lower price for his Berkshire shares and started buying insurance companies, he would have earned an additional $200 billion in profit for himself and his investors. 
In his 2015 letter to shareholders, Buffett outlined his vision for the next 50 years at Berkshire and included the following cautionary statement: "Berkshire's long-term gains ... cannot be dramatic and will not come close to those of the past 50 years."
If BTC becomes the new gold, it currently is valued at under 1% of golds value. 
It has room to grow. BRK-much much much smaller room for growth .
Keep telling yourself thou that brk is the future.

Lol it’s funny how you want to discuss facts and yet are so clearly ill equipped for this discussion 
Btc is up , 82,000% in that time vs your 300%. So first off, BRK was obviously the weaker pick.
And I am super confident on that bet. Want to make it which appreciates in value more ? 1k bet BRK vs BTC? 
 “being around” can easily mean both exist so there is no definitive outcome, but if we bet on which increases in value that shall give us results. We can even do which MC is larger, with BRK at ~7.5 times btc currently, that should give you a fair enough head start.
BTC as an asset is an aspect of it, not the totality of the system. It’s easy to transact with, relatively liquid and “throwing off cash” is a pointless statement.
For example , you have no mention of BTC as a secure system? You really think security is valueless ? 
You also clearly are not aware btc is coming into fruition as can be remarked by gov official, biz leaders, official regulatory measures, or being the  appreciation in value in the world in the last 10 years.
The people who manage the largest exchanges in the world - which dwarf BRK’s transactional value - don’t call brk the future . Digital Assets are the future - this is generally agreed upon by the wealthiest institutions. As a matter of fact, no one calls brk the future. To the point that Buffet doesn’t signal he is this great mastermind investor, rather it worked out for him for a few stocks and he sticks to a simple investment methodology - which he has definitely been burned on before.  Investing in a diversified S&amp;P in the last decade would of given you greater profits than BRK. There is literally nothing in the world that you could of invested in in the last 10 years that would of given you greater returns than btc.
And it is buffet vs an innovative math based system. The asset portion is just an aspect of btc

lol. Where is your proof? You are so wrong it’s comical. Explain why gold is worth 7 T ? and how in a time of crisis we will revert to using gold ? If we are in crisis where our current systems have completely broken down, no one will accept your gold as looting, pillage, and open anarchy will be how things are operated. If it’s a relative system failure, like over leverage of credit (due to human greed ) , then btc system would thrive because it’s mitigation against the secular impact.
Bakkt is a new entity created by microsoft, starbucks, and Ice who collectively deal with trillions of dollars in assests and exchange values ,
and they are quoted as saying digital assets are the future . On record. 
yet you with your more informed opinion, knowledge, information, data , really understand how markets work ? 
Please highlight to me how you are so sure you know what you are talking about , to directly contradict the largest managers of exchanges in the world , and some of the largest companies in the world.  Please talk to me about your superior understanding of markets ?
The people who literally control the exchange house where gold is sold say digital assets are definitely worthy and have value. But enlighten me on your other data which shows otherwise ?


when you say statements like this . Lol.  So misinformed 


Youre a noob. Most btc heads talk about btc as a utility, a tool which you can definitely do things with , the price is an aspect. You talking about btc and referencing price movement so feverishly shows you know nothing . People who understand bitcoin can discuss it without mentioning the price.


retards keep talking about it as investment. 
lmao. dude due some research 
I guess microsoft executive are “retards “and the people who literally manage trillions of dollars and the worlds exchanges - where gold is traded, -where stocks are traded are “retarded” right ? You are more informed then they are ? Because you are directly saying they are wrong and you are right.. and you have absolutely 0 info and data to back up your point. 
As countries have experienced government corruption which leads to hyper inflation , guess what they turn to? Btc .. as can be proven in multiple countries. As in today, the data is actually there, people have turned to btc under hyperinflation. Unlike your subjective and uninformed opinion. 
BAKKT just raised 182 Million dollar investment funding for their digital asset exchange. Literally a few days ago.. They are the stupid ones, I am sure you are widely successful and outperform the NYSE?


Noob.. clueless . If you feel confident let’s make a bet on btc being around - you can pick anytime within the next 100 years and I’ll bet 1k btc will still exist and thrive at that time. If you lose , you owe me 1k.
If you’re so  confident in your understanding of what things are, you should have no problem making this bet right ?

But that “sole purpose” is so far off that’s like saying a cars sole purpose is to get in a car crash. 
From an outside perspective, if you were coming from a culture in the Amazon and looked at cars you may infer cars are meant to get into car crashes. To people  within the society or culture of cars, it’s obvious for many reasons this is not the case. But it’s understandable the misrepresentation or limited perspective of an outsider can lead them to this incorrect conclusion.

thanks m8 (justin). 
Everyone argues deflationary system won’t work but that’s  just a cheaply mass produced econ theory. 
It’s like when people argue barter and system is how money came into existence; when money evolved most  from a credit based system.
Debt is neither good or bad but it’s easy to construct fraudulent  debt systems which create financial slavery (see history)
A deflationary currency is actually perfect.  
Essentially if you are not using your money, it appreciates in value slowly over time.
(Rather than being lodged deeper into debt in a forever viscous cycle as the money you have slowly loses value) 
Obviously people will still spend money simply because they HAVE to. And are as you point consumeristic. 
A lot more ends up changing, when people’s financial situation improves , as people have security they can then transact more economic value. If the average person was  wealthier, there would be more money to go around. The opposite spectrum is as the average person racks up more debt, if their money also loses value, then to dig themselves out of this debt becomes even harder- which is disproportionately beneficial to the debtor.  From way back in time with religion, people in power WANT you to be debt (which leads to different legislation vs independently using debt as leverage) So debt based systems are promoted and taught rather than [neutral] financial based systems. Like the incorrect notion that inflation is good, deflation is bad .
TLDR; debtors love inflation cause it continues debt enslavement.
People who loan out credit (debtors) tend to be in positions of power/control and want to keep it that way.
Deflationary currency allows people to more easily acquire gains +, aka not good for people in positions of control. 
Whether thru religion, economic professors, or media, deflationary currencies have quickly been promoted to be “terrible econ methods “. 
In reality, it’s one of the smartest things the world can do. If you know your money always increases in value you instantly become more thoughtful of your spending .
— 
Keep explaining to people your positive thoughts on deflationary currency even if 1,000 sheep cite economics that’s been funded by wealthy people that  don’t want a deflationary system to even thought of being realized or how it’s clearly common sense.

Well yeah, i did pretty easily school you. 


Completely clueless. Do you think everyone goes to the center of the village and votes on what will become money? Lol.  Do you understand that society is literally defined by the agreement of common laws amongst men?  You don’t understand that organization requires central governance since the dawn of humanity? Even in nomadic tribes you will have elders and leaders.  Decentralized decision consensus happened for the first time on earth in 2009. 


Just because you don’t understand something, doesn’t mean it is stupid. If anything, that’s more a reflection on you


It’s pretty telling when you put tulips and precious metals in the same sentence and you think they function identical �� You really don’t understand why gold, or precious metals, have been valuable for thousands of years while fiat currencies last on average 26. And tulips as a commodity lasted for a few weeks. It’s telling that you think of all of these things as the same thing (cause you don’t understand what good money is)

Just remember someone tried to convince you otherwise to learn and understand bitcoin.
And for the failed companies, which I am sure you can’t even identify 5 of them without googling them, they had ideas which are represented in valuable companies today. The issue wasn’t with the internet, it was that the audience didn’t understand the internet and companies still needed to refine the production process(delivery, warehouses, etc). 
Toy website, food delivery website, alternative currency website, social media website. 
These are some of the big companies that failed in dotcom... let me know if you think those ideas don’t currently exist as profitable companies today, 15 years later.

Hmm, in your last post you seemed to know the ‘history of money’
but your reply has nothing to do with money and it’s history. 
So remember your initial post stated the statement bitcoin fundamentally changes money is incorrect? And then I responded to how bitcoin changes money from the ground up.
Your response does nothing to address this , instead you want to talk in theoreticals. But i got time.
First off, your arguing a secondary different issue now.


So you are missing a whole lot of information. Still going to be offended when I say you just don’t get the debate at hand ?  
To start off,  bitcoin doesn’t need to have a USD price evaluation. So everything you wrote, is incorrect. 1 btc = 1 btc . People could exchange goods and services, with bitcoin as the system to exchange the trade of value. 
For example: Teach a spanish lesson for 5 satoshis per hour. As society accepts bitcoin in more and more places, you wouldn’t even need to go back to fiat. So your whole argument that bitcoin only goes up due to fiat completely misunderstands what bitcoin allows. A global market has been constructed, that has no boundaries. Usd needs to be exchanged into Yuan cause both have their primary central jurisdictions. Btc doesn’t have borders, so trade can completely be done in btc without a fiat system.


Completely wrong. Bitcoins finite supply in a world of ever growing (new humans are born) means that as time passes, btc * would * go in value, because its supply is not infinite.  


Funny to start off claiming you understand moneyX and then making such a ridiculously typed sentence as this. 


This is... just a stupid comment. I understand how pedantic you are trying to be towards the word inflation, but you are completely incorrect. Inflation is when the price of goods rise. If something costs 1 btc today, due to its limited supply, in 10 years it’s impossible the item will cost is 1.1 btc +. The cost of goods, denoted in btc will always decrease - even more so if fiat wasn’t involved.
This comes from your misunderstanding that btc is itself volatile. It’s not, btc is always relative to itself. 1 btc = 1 btc (not fully true until last bitcoin is mined).
Fiat does not sustain 1$ = 1$. Because it has an infinite supply, so over time the costs of good increase in fiat prices. 
Bitcoin literally would work the opposite - the cost of goods would always decrease in how much btc is needed. 
We see or witness that this isn’t always the case today BECAUSE fiat exists, and fiat doesn’t remain true to its self over time. 
So because fiat exists, a car might be 1 btc today and 1.2 btc tomorrow, but as time passes, even if there is positive fluctuations, a car will generally move from 1 btc to .75 btc to .5 btc , as time goes on. This is a deflationary currency.
Inflationary currencies are the opposite, which is why cars *increase* in fiat cost, decade to decade. 


You literally don’t understand what supply increases means. 
Everything you wrote is incorrect btw. Which is why as time goes on, smaller and smaller amounts of btc is needed to make a purchase, while more and more fiat is needed to make that same purchase.
Like literally, everything you wrote is incorrect. 
So your first “topic” of “knowing what money is” , you got schooled on and avoided any direct counter arguments. You switched to a new argument and... completely made a fool of yourself.
If you think i’m lying, compare any item in the world to the price of btc and the price of usd. And see if over time, if it costs more usd and less btc. Technology which has production efficiency increased should obviously not be used as an example, since its decrease in fiat value has nothing to do with fiat as a system but rather better production. Go google the cost of a burger in 1950 vs today. And then look in the mirror and make the dumbass statement that, in btc valuation ... that burger would also see an increase in price across time (a burger costs 1 btc in 2010 and will cost 2 btc in 2020)

Sigh.... I did back it up with facts, and the “you don’t get it” is assigned to OPs own words and understandings. His words revealed that there was significant amounts of information they were not aware of, because if you were and in possession of this information - different worded answers would of been given.
Equally so, is the irony, of claiming someone else to be patronizing arrogant for making a statement that someone else doesn’t get something. 
You don’t think if you were to enter a class on a subject , suggest a worded theory that seems good on the surface, but fundamentally misses inherent issues, a classmate can’t say you aren’t understanding what’s going on? 
For a basic example someone may join Akido to learn to beat people up, but someone studying Akido would be able to * quickly * infer if you are in it to harm others, your missing the point.
Also, it does change what money is. Money is a medium of exchange, but fundamentally, that system has always throughout history or, “since times of the animal kingdom” been assigned worth based on the ruling party. 
Bitcoin inherently doesn’t value anyone more so than anyone else. 
I can go into the long history of what money is, which I am sure you haven’t taken the time to study. If you did, you would understand that bitcoin changes money *completely*. From the ground up.
If you want to debate me on what money is, let’s begin. 
You say: 


You probably make a very erroneous judgement call that money arises due to natural bargaining between people. There is actually a critical prior step which you aren’t aware of. That is, a ruling leader/majority/ party defines what will be used as “money”.  
Due to natural human conduct like greed and excess, this means that any system of money that has existed, has benefited the ones who created it.
Bitcoin inherently doesn’t value anyone more so than anyone else. 
So if you want to go into when in African tribes used sticks, or beads, or cows as “currencies” you must first acknowledge that there is a convergence of human agreement. Behind human agreement is centralized authority. So money, as it’s been utilized in society from tribes to civilization, comes from a central source. Even if it’s the village elders saying sticks are now valuable , and we are the ones that bless the sticks. 
Again, bitcoin as a money system inherently does not value or benefit any one person over the other.
So, indeed this is actually a new system of money which we are using
Your words : 


If you feel like you have been studying the history of money more, please respond with a comment about how anything I said was incorrect. 
If it is correct , a system of money which doesn’t benefit a central authority - has been created for the first time in civilization, 
This has a cascading effect on what debt and power comes to mean. Regardless, what money is for us will fundamentally change. 
For example: 
can you name any truly defined deflationary currency used by a society throughout history?
Do you know what the effects of a deflationary currency is, over time, for a society? If essentially anyone in a society, that by holding their current currency, has that value increase over time. Do you understand the effects of this or can give prior examples of this system either succeeding or failing ?
Imagine if when a homeless person received instead of 1$ usd, they received .0000025 btc. The very act of HAVING a deflationary currency, implements/makes your currency also an investment.So essentially anyone, just by having money, has an investment. 
So for the first time in history, by simply possessing money, you equally also possess an investment opportunity. In a fairly distributed system*(gold is not fairly distributed or ultimately guaranteed deflationary)
But please tell me how money isn’t changed by these new fundamental features. 
I’ll wait for your response.

Not really. It’s more  like Charles Merrill who thought the food service industry should be apart of wall street stocks at a time when people thought buying stocks of food companies was hilariously idiotic. 
So he pushed for things like Mcdonald’s being listed on NYSE. Because he thought food companies were legit businesses. 
A lot of bitcoin is shilled for profits, but bitcoin as a system (blockchain, decentralized sovereign money) it is exceptionally revolutionary. 
More and more advisers  who deal with finances will recommend it, because it is a useful and powerful financial tool. .. So yes it does turn profits, but it has its real use case, which would be an improvement on the current system. 
Henry Ford publicly would not shut the fuck up about the revolution of the automobile. He also manufactured auto mobiles. 
Does H.Ford calling cars the “way of the future” become invalid simply because he also manufactures cars? 
No. - we should look at the results of what’s going on. And the CEO’s call to have atleast some money allocated to btc is spot on.
@_date: 2019-05-12 15:38:26


and just about everything we have is from people that did believe in something and pushed that belief.




You did comment saying the assumption that Ford made the automobile.. so that’s why I had to clarify that.  And my point is that the fact he has vested interest in something he is promoting, does not invalidate that item .
I think youre trying to find something that sounds nice and profound... but this isnt it.  Your “advice” is an  oversimplified commentary. Like no shit you should be skeptical when hearing about financial advise, that’s like base line border no brainer obvious...
But your intake on ‘be skeptical because he has vested interest’ is where the oversimplification kicks in. 
The fact that you thinks someone value or idea is merited or meritless because of personal interest shows just how close your nose is to the book and missing the forest for the tree.
In all business there is vested interest - as well as idea or product  promotion.
And your comment about a hedge fund manager promoting his own asset seems a bit hollow and uninformed. 1) btc wasn’t created by the hedge fund manager 2) Hedge fund managers are suppose to talk about what they think is the best financial move 3) The hedge funds mananger’s job is to find the best financial strategies, implement them, and communicate this plan.
So yeah, the hedge fund manager is literally doing his job description. A manager would talk about what he thinks is a great opportunity. Synthesize the opportunity based on its legs, not a shit prejudgment.

I think you are confused about how information works. His point is Tom is always wrong about predictions and a fool for even predicting which is both subjective and inaccurate.
If you look at Tom’s work experience , his prediction models and analyses obviously have held water since he has been a leader in a variety of analyses roles.


People clearly don’t know understand a prediction is a calculated guess. The weatherman makes predictions everyday , and is often wrong. Do you , in your refined knowledge and mannerisms of always being right , do you tell the weatherman he is stupid and destined to be speculative and gambling his answers ? Do you insist the weatherman keep his mouth close and shut down his channel, because making weather predictions is more irrational than predicting climate ?
Toms job, what he does for a living , is to analyze data sets. Him saying BTC EOY price is one plate, it’s one entree of many he has served in his kitchen . So criticizing him as personally derelict based off of 1 prediction is short sighted, to say he is misinformed is short sighted and to say because people make predictions on btc price they are fools is condesencendinfly stupid . OBVIOUSLY he doesn’t know the guaranteed price outcome , obviously he doesn’t have a crystal ball and obviously he has never ever stated the things he says are to be taken as literal facts and ways to live your life by. He simply says “the data shows “ and reflects his analyses. And if you feel I am wrong or he is wrong on that, source me one time he says his predictions are all encompassing, 100% guaranteed to be right, or that anything he says is meant to always come true. 
Predictions based off data are just that , predictions. When the weatherman tells me there is low chance of rain and if rains I don’t think him stupid because I understand he is isn’t speaking in absolutes. lee doesn’t speak in absolutes either he is simply making a calculated guess - and he is being put on TV because his calculated guesses in the past overall have led to a lot of information or extraction by big biz.    
If you think BTC’s price can not be predicted then you  must believe support levels,  ceilings, and floors don’t exist - and we cannot identify areas of “resistance”. ...   
If you can identify areas of support on BTCs price well then you are making predictions. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 15:19:49
Did you read the title or actually watch the video ? The title is written by cnbc - not Tom Lee , and the title is referencing when Tom Lee earlier in that day stated “Btc above 20k EOY” and the news station invited him back, as some people thought he was giving bearish indicators because he was not saying 25k EOY. 
So the title on their segment was referencing the clarification of Tom Lee between saying 20k+ vs 25K which both figures he got to by calculating historical mining costs vs trading price. 
No where does he himself say this is a guarantee , he clearly states “historically the data has shown us ____”
So try again 
@_date: 2018-12-14 02:47:35
if you look at his career he has a productive  work history, so it’s not that his predictions have no use .
If we were to talk about his predictions of bitcoin in 2018 market that’s just 1 prediction model.
His price has been attached to analyses of factors which over all make sense to use (not live by) . It’s a prediction, not a destiny and i’m sure he has never describe it as anything definitive. 
Additionally the market in this year has many many external pressures, anyone following crypto can attest to that.
If a basketball player had to throw a free throw we can say he has 95%+ to score .
If a basketball player has to throw a free throw during a championship game with the game on the line and everything coming down to this last play sequence - mathematically the story hasn’t changed, but the pressure has. 
Considering all the chaos going on with the market, particularly the stories that we have seen in 2018 - Hacks bi-weekly of exchanges, hash war, ico scams, regulations, the UP market in 2017, cme’s, etc . It’s a very tumultuous year and I’m willing to figuratively bet as we move forward this kind of storm won’t always be so catastrophic - other issues yes undoubtedly will pop up but because a model of prediction didn’t come true in 2018 doesn’t mean there is nothing there, btc isn’t going to rise back up to new ATH, or that Mr. Lee is clueless.  
@_date: 2018-12-15 06:25:22
explain why using data to make a prediction on weather vs markets is an “asinine abuse of analogy” 
or moreso, why the mentioning of the uncontrollableness of predicting weather (short term) is such an “abuse of analog” when compared alongside the difficulty of predicting of markets (short term) 
both you are using deterministic averages while looking at current conditions to still make predictions, with the  understanding there are uncontrollable outside events.

On top of that, CNBC wrote the clickbait title which, if you...ya know actually read and looked at the video , he never states his response in the manner with which the headline wrongfully reflects

Your stating 2 different things , one that BTC isn’t money  and two that BTC can’t be money because of stability and I want to inform you otherwise.
I can find a price associated with BTC right now, as it actually can be used as money (an exchange of value) and is - and has been being used for 10 years. Money is a means of exchange and there are 5 main characteristics which make something good to use as money, and although stability is a great addition u technically don’t need it - but then acceptance would be hard to come by, so it’s kind of implied stability is a good thing to have. 
-Fungibility 
-Portability 
-Limited supply and 
-Acceptance 
and btc actually pasts the check list with all of this.


You could send me copy posts of other people’s words because you don’t understand them yourself ? 


It does produce value, (why do you think it’s worth 3200$ for 1 and not $0 or approaching $0 for 1) 


It’s value is what people determine it to be, and what they determine it to be will probably be off of what they can determine its functionality is, and when you look at its functionality you understand why it’s worth 100B and will go to trillions market cap.


links to understand this issue,
You could link me whatever you want lol. I’ll read it, debate it, and BTC will still be here in the morning - and 10 years from now.


Dividends are references to a corporate structure and  come from Q or yearly profits which is not the same structure as what blockchain is. 
Can coins be minted/mined/verified/ or loyalty programs initiated ? Yea then those type of dividends can be paid out. We can say miners are paid a dividends, which you can enter BTC network and mine whenever you want.

i don’t see bitcoin specifically going  to quantum network  as nodes all have to be corresponding. A migration to quantum nodes for bitcoin seems logistically improbable and historically impossible.
Your theory of quantum computer publishing a fake POW chain to be the new hierarchy can’t work. The quantum computer’s nodes wouldn’t integrate with current nodes, so a QM fake chain has to be created on an entirely quantum based network.
(atleast that’s my understanding)

Since this OP post is about Tom Lee, let’s keep it to him. Source on his numerous predictions  outside of EOY 2018?
Unless you mean when Tim Draper predicted BTC at 10k EOY when it was 1k , and got it right ? He has btc for 250k + in 2022


He very much so is a real analyst , and I am guessing significantly more qualified than you. And yeah, you can actually make a prediction about all types of stuff 


Wrong , this is not what BTC is first. It’s a protocol 


Wrong and you confuse not tangible with no value. Just because you can’t see something, does not mean it’s not valuable. You only assume it has no value, and you can come to that conclusion, but others can see and utilize this tool differently .


�� why do you put his name in quotes like that lmao. He’s a real person, not the bogey man. Do you quote bill gates or richard branson or Vitalik name ?


2.	⁠the supply is higher than the known demand which would signal= price low.
3.	⁠“EQUILIBRIUM”, this is where supply is eaten up by the same amount of demand and this= a level price nor up or down.
I know this is a cool section in econ books but a lot more affects the price. As an example, the demand is attached to pending regulation , so its true value is limited or not revealed as market indecision doesn’t land a stable price 


Anyone who thinks like this is the real fool. Of course analysts realize data has significance but doesn’t relay destiny. Prediction models are useful and are used daily in many different institutions and aspects. Predicting the price of btc is just another slice of analyses, and it’s fair to predict on anything that can have potential (value) . If not, why do you even get out of bed if you’re going to die anyways. 


I know it’s fun to tote conspiracy theorists , and obviously people who own something want it to go up in value , but apparently you don’t recognize it’s technology (u don’t cause you called bitcoin a speculative asset first) . People find this technology incredibly valuable. To an analyst, an immutable open ledger is like finding north america all over again with a new bountiful in resources for conducting business. Blockchain takes data science to a new frontier, so I am guessing that’s one of his motivations. Also, he makes prediction models for a living, so predicting BTC is just another segment of his work load. No where does he say that  he has a crystal ball, and never have I heard him say anything he is talking about is a guarantee - it’s always “this is what the data shows”. If you can find even 1 time when he is guaranteeing his predictions i’ll take back my words.
So all that crystal ball talk is mystification in your own head.  




No it doesn’t. Adoption isn’t way down and please don’t lecture me on supply and demand


In the market, if you are following people then you are behind the crowd. 


Btc isn’t going anywhere. 


I guess you save the irony for last
@_date: 2018-12-14 07:56:57


Hmm , i think you are confusing your experience with the experience of others. Many people spend crypto, whether on small item transactions or large ones. Bitcoin is accepted in various countries throughout the world . Many countries actually have bitcoin listed as legal tender or a form of currency - These are countries which have enacted legislation to accept it , so again your own personal experience doesn’t define what it means to everyone else. 


So this is your sentiment , but it’s not factually correct. 
Bitcoin has increased in adoption in 2018 and incase you didn’t know debit cards are a relatively new creation. 


So it is a currency , you just confuse your opinion of it with the results 


Yeah paper bitcoins have unfortunately brought btc price done like they have done to every other asset.


How do you ask me if I want links and then type a line like that 


No it’s math . Market caps can be somewhat irrelevant but for predicting BTC price it’s useful as you can compare it to other assets/values.
 &gt;as I’ve told you it produces nothing, 
That’s your opinion and I am not trusting it as you seem to make it off low or inadequate information 


So don’t invest , and then regret 10 years later. It’s worth 80 billion dollars, most people don’t use it or understand it , and it’s only 10 years old - Btc is doing great for its self. If btc went from 1k last to 3k this year (without the spike to 20k) you would be saying this is the most stable, secure investment.
But let’s not go into hypothetical situations. Do you know what the best performing asset is in the last 10 years ? Even with the market down ? Bitcoin. 


How many investors do you personally known?


0 times . You confuse exchange hacking with btc hacking . Btc has been hacked 0 times 


Luck is not something you say with protocols (math) 
And you can make prediction models 


No.. dividends give payment, not security - those are 2 different things 


Btc is actually extremely secure - part of why it’s worth 80B$ even with so much FUD around it


Correct I do watch him and make sure to stay informed with various speakers. Notice I didn’t have to link him but you understood ? It’s because our points are information based - not based on our egos but on economics. 
Thanks for coming to my ted talk. BTC long

compare Us lifestyle (and western democracy) to say.. any totalitarian regime, monarchy, or theocratic governance 
1 2 3 go
Guess youre not aware the normality of having to say a prayer to the representation of your god- king in government (prior to USA)
People don’t really understand how much the constitution influenced and changed the world.
The emergence of specifically the United States constitution and ideals, the legality of the Patent office, the very reason “technology “ is alive and wasn’t stamped out by the state-government  of old is embedded in the “pursuit of happiness” of USA governance. 
As OP mentions, bitcoin is very similar in its empowerment as the US Constitution (which flamed democracy and brought down the everyday normality of being ruled by a King,  brought about the middle class and essentially ended slavery, genocide, and open regime killing off its citizens - the only places that have these issues are countries that don’t have democracy )
If you think the united states doesn’t have a moral and economically uplifting affect  to the entire world, please go to UAE and insult their king. Just spit on a poster of him and let me know how your 10 years of hard larbor work out.

I think you should
 1) understand what his prediction numbers are based off of, they are not just “random” .
2) you should understand what a prediction is vs fantasy 
3) Know he is a data analyst so he isn’t just saying numbers but using data and mathematics to reveal patterns. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 19:41:45
He was on the show so his company linked to that segment , like they have for all his other segments and for every time he has appeared on CNBC.
Their links are to CNBC’s titles 
Maybe your compression levels shouldn’t be so low you assume someone to say something when the very thing you provide as proof clearly reflects your point to be unsubstantiated 
@_date: 2018-12-14 18:38:45
he made his prediction off the cost to mine BTC. and yes paper bitcoins (over the counter traded) are terrible for the system , that’s why i included coe’s in my list of things affecting the current price. But if you see 200,000 transferring only 200,000 can be exchanged on exchanges (unless leveraged positions - but those are actually backed by value) . Outside of exchanges, on OTC desks people can purchase “paper “ btc which gives a false supply. You can just say paper btc or OTC btc instead of rehypotheficated

BTC/blockchain gives rise to the possibility of autonomous robots added into the economy. I know Andreas Antonopolous talks about it in a youtube video or Ivan on tech’s first videos on iota discusses how we are going to (soonish) see robots trading amongst themselves and other humans.
With humans being shortsighted with the health of the planet , there is actually a legit possibility we bring about our own doom. I’m sure Keseir said it more tongue in cheek and not to be pedantic but in the event that we burn our planet within the next 150 years - the autonomous robots could have a system of sustainability and be programmed to learn “and outlive our stupidity”.
I personally think (and hope) we swerve left and green energy becomes the next infrastructure revolution( so our planet doesn’t comatose) Seems there are a lot of great people on the planet taking steps to make this happen.

You literally use the word stunt and discuss him getting people involved and then exit[ing]
You also compare him to John McAfee - who is known to promote coins just to sell them in a dishonest way. 
And again I was just pointing out that’s not at all how Tony Robbins has ever operated. He’s a deeply respected humanitarian and spends his life consistently trying to help and teach others... and he’s been doing this for like 30 years which shows it’s not an act.
If he’s promoting BTC it’s cause he thinks it’s an honest product  and not a “get people involved so you can inflate price”  and “sell”  the “stunt” similar to what “McAfee” would do. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:53:25
if you think tony is consumed by “doing things for money “ you have obviously never heard him speak... or are aware he wants to fed 1 Billion people for free over the course of his lifetime 
@_date: 2018-12-31 16:01:20


You’re essentially saying he’s doing this as a money grab scheme and that’s just about as wrong of a description as you can ever put to a guy like Tony Robbins .
McAfee yes, but Robbins wouldn’t promote something hollow with the intentions to take investors money and run with it.  
So i’m responding to exactly as you wrote it. But yeah if he helps bring awareness to btc then that’s only positive news

bakkt, ironically, will give crypto that sustainability . All the banks have already come on board to propose a newly regulated exchange house.
It’s sitting on governments desks right now and ICE, the largest exchange conglomerate in the world which transects in the trillions amount has been working on this since 2014.
Their words not mine
There is already also proposed legislation to make digital assets their own tax class
A lot of the big players are already working on this and the beauty is most countries understand not being left behind in technological innovation. If South Korea and Japan promote open crypto innovation, it forces other countries to take a peek and not  outperformed. Brazil, France, Estonia, Canada, Argentina, etc, a very healthy chunk of earths countries are interested in opening house with digital assets-  Their respective country leaders and ministers have stated as such. 
Once bakkt is launched, that’s essentially usa officially saying it’s legal to play in the bitcoin market. With germany’s exchange launching around the end of Jan 2019, I am sure ice does not want to lose space to competitors, but regardless the facts are they will launch shortly. Whether it’s 40, or 56 days crypto is going to change in a big way shortly. And whats even funnier is the halving will be about 1.2 years away from happening, meaning demand on supply can really gas this market for quite the run up over some time. 
I wouldn’t be surprised if amazon accepts btc or eth as payment within 12 months of bakkt launching, and then once that happens .. crypto will be blended into daily life as much as smartphones

Ford didn’t create the automobile.. he made the process to assemble automobiles more efficient and had a good idea on selling the automobile as an everyday item for all people. He would make a fortune if automobiles became normal .. but he also genuinely believed the world would be a better place for it. Those two truths don’t have to be exclusive.
David Sarnoff promoted the idea and “revolution” of the wireless radio .. as he worked for a radio station. But he genuinely believed wireless communication was the way of the future and promoted it heavily (when the titanic sank, it was his idea to read over the radio the titanics SOS distress story - in a way to help radio sales but also to unite the public)
John H Johnson who created JET black magazine made tons of money by having black readers buy his magazine. He would even write in his magazines, the idea that buying his magazine was an empowering move. Mr Johnson’s pockets fattened tremendously the more he promoted Jet magazines - but he also genuinely  believed by giving ‘Negro’s their own magazine that expressed  and highlighted their rich culture, that he was uplifting the “souls of his fellow men” in a time it was okay to call a black man “boy”. 
My point is somethings validity should never be completely dismissed based on the reason that someone has a vested interest.  It’s not good judgement but instead willful ignorance and highly short sighted.


Can you think of how many businesses, industries, ideas, creations and scientific understandings exist because someone believed in something and promoted the idea to be true?

Again you called BTC a speculative asset FIRST. Money is an aspect of it, but that’s not what it is .
