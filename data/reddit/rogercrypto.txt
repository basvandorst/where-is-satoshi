The answer is obvious. Bitcoin will always be number one. At the moment  Bitcoin is leading the way (this year Bitcoin dominance has crossed the 50 percent mark) and with the disappearing of a number of  minor coins its position will only grow. So, as for me there is no way Bitcoin can loose its position, It will be the leading coin.

Can agree on this point as  the co-founder of Ethereum, co-founder of Bitcoin Magazine and  one of the most influential minds in blockchain technology Vitalik Buterin says that he sees the future of cryptocurrency only if there is a platform to use coins as cash.

Nice one, but as for me it is never late to invest into cryptocurrency. The last post by  President of Xapo Ted Rogers says that the price of bitcoin may go lower in the future

According to  the President of Xapo, there will be a discount for Bitcoin. And I can totally agree on it . Now the dominance of bitcoin is obvious, but if the prediction is right, a number of coins will disappear soon and it may result in a lower price of Bitcoin.

Well, with my resent study of the market and the last case with Ethereum, I think that Bitcoin price will only decrease in the future. Also I think that it is not wise to invest in any minor cryptocurrency as a number of them may disappear in the close future.   
Here is a report by CNN;
 CCN [report]( “There are some indications that the altcoin sell-off, spurred by largely by [ethereum]( has come as blockchain startups funded through initial coin offerings (ICOs) have reached the point in the bear market where they risk cannibalizing whatever remains of their runway if it continues for much longer”   
Also, Xapo president claimed lately;  
 90%+ of coin list will disappear eventually – might as well happen now, meantime, lower BTC price means incredible opportunity to buy more
