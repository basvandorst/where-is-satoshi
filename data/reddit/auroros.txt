Oh, I just assumed it was Sweden. Norwegian and Swedish looks alike sometimes I guess. I haven't seen any Swedish stores or online stores take bitcoins. But I never lose hope!

Oh boy! Just ja, pizza24 kommer jag ihåg.

Including the land where that tile is. Some awkward visits are bound to happen.

Where in Sweden is this? I would love for BTC to become a thing here.

They do. The limit is 0.01 as well.

Currently 0.01, however.

I used to use my gaming rig while I was asleep, and I didn't want to dualboot for that purpose alone.

Oh damn, that sucks. I bet it wasn't worth it in the end.
I used both an AMD and an Nvidia card to mine without any issues besides heat. I was even able to mine on one card while playing games with the other, and I didn't run into any troubles.

More or less a unique key which cannot be copied or "stolen" because everybody in the network(the peers, not the people) know who that coin belongs to and who that wallet got it from. 
In order to steal a bitcoin you must have a voice which is greater than 50% of the peers, which means if you were to create a new number of attackers you would have to create more than 800,000 new wallets and hosts in order for a possible attack ([source of number]( In order to trade bitcoins they have to get confirmed by enough peers.
Basically it's a secure, private and currency which is not controlled by a state. However the number of bitcoins always increase by the same amount every day, even if the miners increase. This is regulated by a difficulty of hashes to solve. Basically means that the more people who mine it, the harder it gets.
There are other cryptocoins out there with lower difficulty, but lower value as well. [Here]( you can trade in and monitor the prices of the more popular cryptocoins in case you're interested. Kinda works like stocks more than money when you think of it.
