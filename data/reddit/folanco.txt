Wait WUT!
He committed suicide and THEN went to prison?! How much time did he serve?
@_date: 2016-08-11 16:06:22
Damm, that's harsh. But about death in general, personally speaking, If I ever wake up and find myself dead, I will literally go insane.
@_date: 2016-08-11 13:42:14
Yea, so you just gave $600,000 ?
@_date: 2018-01-16 01:52:47

PM me how much do you have and would like to withdraw, I can buy them from you for Dirhams
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:19:39
Take a look at that chart, and then press all to see the path of BTC since the beginning. I think we will see $50,000 by the end of this year \(based on BTC movement for the past 7 years, not days or months\).
@_date: 2016-03-09 19:07:58
PM me what rate you are considering. We will negotiate everything there.
@_date: 2017-03-13 15:31:36
... with much less money :(
@_date: 2016-03-09 13:47:17
You can trade with me if you want to. Check my profile and GCX rep and reddit reputation. I'm considering buying some paypal ($900) for my BTC.
If you are interested, PM me with your rate and more details.
**Edit**: [Here is my GCX Rep](

I've used money to buy a haircut, but I've never used a haircut to buy anything.
@_date: 2019-03-19 17:35:40
Bought @ $9000 and then more @ $7000. I don't have money to buy more :( and this is the problem.  
\* (Forgot to mention that I had some BTC on me when it was around @ 14k ... Still hodling)

This is some hot freestylin' shiiiiittttt
@_date: 2016-06-24 01:54:20
Thanks for the clarification.
@_date: 2016-06-24 01:41:23
How will it affect BTC? if Stay/Leave.

@_date: 2017-09-20 16:10:12
Maybe 2Pac is actually BTC ?
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:07:29
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:56:35
True. I agree with you.
However, the Polo-Effect on currencies is something that plays a huge role in their prices and cannot be neglected.
Check out this for example
This is one way of sending a coin's price to oblivion and change it's price dramatically, even if the coin is active and developing well.
And if the main trading platform for one coin goes down, so does it's price.
@_date: 2018-04-20 12:40:12
Yes pleaaaaase.
Been a long time since I last saw a meme here.
Maybe this is the reason why BTC price was down.
@_date: 2015-03-08 14:15:25
Thank you :)
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:39:06
So it's BS!
@_date: 2015-03-08 05:55:34
I love your way,
Thanks for lifting our spirits, I think it's just a bad time now, everything will be ok later :)
@_date: 2015-03-16 09:50:45
Yep, Crypto Currency Exchange
@_date: 2015-03-10 07:55:36
Nice =D
Just a new way and currency for PayPal to screw their customers and seize their funds.

Check these out, basically the same thing: =)

Well, if you have been on the trade scene for the past few hours, you will know how the prices are and how much time you got to buy/sell on a profit or same cost. Plus the margin trading is rekt. And most of the margin buy/sell orders can't be made. Causing a huge loss in seconds.
We are talking about 10k in 5 seconds kind of loss. 
@_date: 2015-03-16 09:35:55
"It posted about not getting hacked" , hehehehe. The irony!
In the link, you can see an image where the site owner saying that hackers have no interest in hacking him, telling customers to stay sure and confident.
And in the first image, he says that he was planning on shutting down the site before being hacked. Hmmm?!
I don't know, but these statements are a bit suspicious to me.
I hope everyone who lost gets their money back.

That's a lot my friend. :)
It will be passed on for sure.

Like this for example?:

I think if you add some color to it on a PC
it will be just like those amazing GTA wallpapers at the loading screens.
Great work btw. :)
@_date: 2015-03-16 17:07:20
Nope, it needs to monitor your heart rate.
If your clothes dryer has one, then go for it !
But the only way to abuse it, is to put your wear on a child and keep scaring him, or strap the wear to your dog's chest and play some catch.

But why be 1 nation in one place when you are already 1 nation, multi cultures, across the whole world. You can be anywhere and holding any citizenship and still use BTC secretly or non secretly. But once you make 1 place for you, you have painted your own target sign on your head.
@_date: 2017-06-24 11:02:38
Yes. Poloniex are poor, we should give them a pass.
