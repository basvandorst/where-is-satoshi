good question, google translate does not seem to help :(

Nice work! 
So, if I understend it correctly, the security lies in the confirmation having to be performed on the screen and not via the USB, is that correct?
Depending on the price I might be interested in buying one of this!

Having some QRcodes on screen for export would also be nice!

I see ... sounds great!
Can you tell us what MCU your using and what screen (brand/model)?
Is the TRNG a discreet component or is it part of the MCU?
Any other hardware stuff that you want to share?
If you need a early tester count me in ;)

I think that bitcoin.de will provide whatever BTCs are needed between their arrangement. I dont think fidor will buy BTC of the markets.

I'm from Lisbon ... but I don't know on any shop that takes BTC :(
Have a nice trip

f if I know .... it as no 'bit' or 'crypto' in the name, i gess it shouldn't be anything worthy of note. :P

but it can be as quick as 1day: Sepa transfer during business hours usualy gets to the destination on the following buisness day. 
But if you have a low trust level (copper) you have to wait two weeks to get your BTCs out.

Is there any company assembling Avalon chips within the Schengen area? 
@_date: 2013-05-17 10:50:04
I agree ... some one will do it, just a matter of time!
You might open sorce the hardware/firmware ... but I gess if you sell the package you'll have plenty of customers!

I got a small suggestion in case any bitcointalk admins are looking at this: having the bitcointalk.com timing out is "bad for business", there are lots of pages linking there.
I suggest you put up a quick static html with something like a maintenance our even a small explanation of the events.

i might be interested in something  like this ... if a good escrow is involve and the receiving address is within the schengen area.
@_date: 2013-07-11 12:53:45
