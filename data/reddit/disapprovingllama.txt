Thanks man. That makes me feel much better. Appreciate it.

No, because I don't understand what they're doing and at this point I'm too afraid to ask. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:44:51
Hmm. So resend with higher transaction fee then? You think that's it, and it's really just a fee issue?

Don't have breadwallet but I don't see why not. I'm guessing breadwallet lets you import single address private keys? Is receiving address something different?

Unless I run into some extra money I don't think I'll be buying anymore. This is more than enough risk for my investments. 
I really got use to the $200-$250 coin price (that's the price the majority of my coins were purchased at) except for the last few, which was kinda painful but necessary. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 21:44:45

Check out some of the Casascius Bitcoin designs. You'll obviously want to change some things, but they seem to have a nice, simple, elegant design that will appeal broadly.

Your post inspired me to pull my purchase history and determine if I was under/over in my bitcoin investment as well. When I started buying coins in March of 2014 Bitcoin was trading @ 680USD/Bitcoin and I purchased very small amounts. The lowest price I ever paid was in January of 2015 for 205USD/Bitcoin. In short my "Break Even" number is $289 USD. So I've made about $77 thus far. It's been fun :)

WikiLeaks is fucking trash now. I'm all for whistle blowing but their bias is completely apparent. The Abramovic 'Spirit Cooking' nonsense (and other over-the-top clickbait shit that they release) look more like fear mongering than useful document disclosure.

Got it as well. Only use Coinbase not Circle, Local BTC, BTCJam or anything else.

They have for a long time now. I'd encourage you to donate if you use the service.

Last time one of these Denarium posts came up I posting saying they didn't have any 'normal' looking coins. It was all Lions and Doves and stuff like that. 
Checked today and they have a very simple "Custom Value Denarium" with nothing but the Bitcoin logo. 
Price was right as well. Ordered right away and now I've got my own physical Bitcoin. Feels good.

I'm still buying. Will continue until I've got 21 coins. 
Don't think I'd buy if the price was $500, but hopefully I can get all the coins I need before then.

Congratulations! I'll get there :) 15 and counting...

So, price is about 1 BTC = 317.46 USD if you look at the ticker at the bottom?

Mycelium says $1.70 for a priority transaction. I've found Coinbase to charge a bit more than recommended, I guess just to ensure they get quick confirmations. Fees have been high for a while.

Do they have a demo mode like [Coinbase does?](

Okay, I'm curious now. What type of product do you sell? 
For the most part, I don't expect privacy if the item is being physically mailed to my address or PO box. Probably the most important thing is that the billing itself is discrete, and the package is shipped so as to not divulge the contents.
