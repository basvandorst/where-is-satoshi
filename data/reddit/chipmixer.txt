mixy.io? Where did you found it?
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:02:48
Try our new tumbler: 
It's not CoinJoin, but UX is very easy.
@_date: 2017-05-31 12:21:20
If you want to be anonymous, use mixer afterwards.

Every time you support KYC exchange sending them your ID, utility bill and video stating you use Bitcoins, you are giving power to those "trusted third parties". And more powerful they are, easier it is to criminalize "non-trusted" ones.
@_date: 2017-05-30 13:24:55
Bitcoin private key is a cryptographic proof of your funds. When you accept somebody else demand for more proof, you are giving them power to make Bitcoin illegal.
Do you really want to give banks permission to judge what is legal?

Used addresses are addresses that you used for transaction. For privacy you shouldn't reuse address but you can still receive payments on them.

Thank you for your comment. Idea of multisigs was rejected, because it is incompatible with fungibility of chips. Not only it would require user to provide their private key long before funding chips, but it would also hard-link chip and user - only this person is able to spend this chip. This inflexibility breaks all privacy features that ChipMixer has.

Simple guide for the bitcoin millionaire who wants to switch to fiat:
1. Notify everyone and their mother how much bitcoins you have.
2. Prove you are not drug dealer, gambler, paedophile, nigerian prince, pyramid schemer by showing your ID, passport, Skype video talk, bank account, exchange account, credit card account, history of your emails.
3. Your application is rejected because guy whom you sold bitcoins with LocalBitcoins used Bitcoin Dice website.
4. Your bitcoins are frozen on "trusted third party of banks" because you are immoral sinner and you should go to hell.
I can't wait till bitcoin exchanges starts to ask fat bankers about their source of funds when they will try to buy bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:43:27
ChipMixer gives you private keys for bitcoins moved before your deposit. You can't trace it when there is no link.
@_date: 2017-07-11 10:57:21
Same Coinbase that gives your data to IRS: 
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:24:42
That's what KYC exchanges lead to. All your data will be shipped to IRS.
@_date: 2017-07-11 09:36:43
How to define "real person":
1. Has a Coinbase account
2. Sent their personal data and photo ID to Coinbase
Do not sell your privacy to take part in poll.

Bitcoin transactions are not anonymous. Use mixers to disconnect your funds, even if you don't own darknet market.
@_date: 2017-07-11 11:21:17
Mix your coins. Don't use KYC exchanges (ie. Coinbase).
Coinbase + gambling = loss of bitcoins
@_date: 2017-07-09 20:00:01
Slow and complicated.
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:39:03
Read the article - US government confiscated them from private owners, then cashier managed to save some of those unique coins before they were melted.
@_date: 2017-06-12 14:34:31
It's not illegal, but it is "immoral". Please check posts with "closed my account" phrase. You will find this:
You have to be honest? They are not honest with you. Every time you want to swap BTC - fiat, they want proofs. Who are you, where do you live, how much you earn, give us your photo. You are a suspect and you need to prove that you are innocent. Do they have to prove anything? Do they show you their photo? Do you know where they live and how much they earn? No. KYC exchanges are know as "trusted third parties". You know who trusts them? Banks.
Please, do not support any KYC/AML exchange by accepting their demands. Keep Bitcoin free.
@_date: 2017-06-23 18:58:08
Yes, buying Bitcoins is still legal.

@_date: 2017-06-06 21:55:15
If you prefer to create accounts on two exchanges, install another wallet and learn about another cryptocurrency - go for it.
Mixers are easier to use.
@_date: 2017-06-21 19:51:26
Before all AML/KYC laws you could buy it on any exchange without linking your identity. Now you have to mix / tumble your coins to escape from blockchain analysis.
@_date: 2017-06-21 15:01:49
How much did you deposit? Any "suspicious" source of deposit ie. gambling?
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:16:33
ChipMixer.com is a bitcoin tumbler that allows you to set your own fee. It give you private keys, so you create withdrawal transaction.
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:14:19
Why pay for tumbling when you can install zcash then pay shapeshift twice? 
1. you don't need to install new cryptocurrency wallet
2. shapeshift can still track your 1 BTC -&gt; x ZCash -&gt; 0.999 BTC exchange
@_date: 2017-06-28 12:43:46
"Bitcoin is anonymous"
1. Every trasaction you do is stored forever. 
2. There are companies that profit from analyzing blockchain to match transactions of the same user, making connections between what they did and where.
3. Governments forces AML/KYC exchanges to track their users and deanonymize their transactions.
I'm not saying to not to use Bitcoin. Use it, but be aware you are not anonymous and you should try to get more financial privacy.
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:16:29
Just because they can create any law, it does not mean we should stick to it. If you don't agree, ask yourself "what would you do if bitcoin was made illegal?".
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:25:41
Bitsquare is slow (it's manual) and volume is low.
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:51:07
Don't hate the thug. Hate the mafia.
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:07:15
What do you mean by 'white listing purposes'?
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:41:16
Or paying online without a credit card / bank.
No, it's too late for that.
@_date: 2017-06-15 10:34:38
This could affect Bitcoin users:
"A family found ~$80 million in Bitcoin paperwallet left by their father. They took the coins to trusted third party exchange, only to have them seized by the US Government."

@_date: 2017-06-12 12:10:08
It is easier to trace one big transaction than a lot of small ones.What they do is instead of sending you full amount, linking their coins, they send you full amount of those small coins, which may look like a lot of customers.
Is it waste of money? No, it buys you privacy from governments and corporations. 
There are different kinds of mixers. ChipMixer instead of multiple withdrawal transactions, gives you private keys to multiple uniform-sized chips. ChipMixer is mempool-friendly. ;)
@_date: 2017-06-03 14:22:52
Is bank account a public place? Would it be weird if your bank called you and said:


Are you going to say that if you want some degree of privacy with banks, then you need to use cash?
@_date: 2017-06-19 19:05:34
Google for 'paypal blocked account'. They lock your account when they decide you have too much money in it and you cannot recover it. 
@_date: 2017-06-05 14:12:58
There is a new service that reinvents bitcoin tumbling: 
Instead of output transaction, you receive private keys that were funded before you deposited your funds into mixer. Thanks to that (and a few other features) it gives better privacy against blockchain analysis.
@_date: 2017-06-06 21:31:04
ChipMixer creators here. We can answer your questions.
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:07:21
You don't know private key at the moment of crossing border which make you not an owner.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:15:21
Bitcoin is a currency. Stop treating it like investment you need to "cash out". It IS cash. Does shopkeeper asks you about source of dollars in your pocket? Why do you give this power to exchanges or banks?

@_date: 2017-06-15 15:19:24
Government confiscates famous but (now) illegal painting. They want to burn it. Guy saves and hides it. Government changes, painting is now legal and it is highly valued cultural heritage. Is he a hero or a villan?
Just because your government stole it, it doesn't make it right.
@_date: 2017-06-23 09:38:05
AML/KYC is a sellout to the banks and governments. Wanting Bitcoin to be regulated is equal to saying "I want to trade my worthless coins for shiny, glowing fiat beads".
Could they make Bitcoin illegal? It worked with drugs, right?
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:17:36
You sent a large sum and triggered AML alarm. Congratulations!
Gemini does not inform you about it, because they are **obliged by law** to not inform anyone about AML alarms, especially **You**, a person who is suspected of money laundering. That's right, my friend. You are an alleged criminal now. Thanks to that, you have no rights and your funds can get civil forfeiture.
Please do not use AML/KYC exchanges.
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:37:41
You are not required to use the betting feature. Just because it exists, it extends possible outputs making blockchain analysis harder. 
You can also treat it as a "donate" button (except 45% times you use it, you will receive twice as much).
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:39:46
Next time use bitcoin mixer to protect yourself (and your funds) from "our trusted moral guardians".
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:18:09


If you tell them that, they will take your money. Any connection with gambling results with account ban on any bank-trusted service. Use a mixer before depositing and never mention any casinos.
Also you don't need fiat to be millionaire. If you have enough BTC, you are millionaire already.

Latest Action: 	05/25/2017 Read twice and referred to the Committee on the Judiciary.
@_date: 2017-06-23 16:20:33
Localbitcoins, bitsquare or any non-AML/KYC exchange.
@_date: 2017-06-03 13:13:36
You assume that drug dealers and hitmen are using mixers while privacy-oriented users use monero. It's the other way.
@_date: 2017-06-13 20:37:45
Private and unlinkable within two weeks? Why wait, you can mix with ChipMixer now.
@_date: 2017-06-03 11:49:24
When you send bitcoins, your wallet may use multiple change inputs, which will link them together as owned by the same person. Blockchain is public and there are companies that earn money by analyzing what goes where. They buy VPNs, sends bitcoins to various gambling sites and then tracks where their money went and how it linked with other addresses.
This information should be included in "Bitcoin 102: Bitcoin is not anonymous".
@_date: 2017-06-28 10:14:11
We could do that exactly once, because then we would have no reputation and nobody would use our main service.
We are the only service that publishes public addresses and private keys for time locked transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-07 06:31:44
We received a lot of request to make it provably fair and we are remaking this feature, but we started the without it, because the main function of mixer is mixing, not gambling.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:40:49
Remember that photo of ID you sent to "trusted bitcoin exchange"? Good luck declaring "no bitcoins" to your government.
@_date: 2017-06-07 05:33:07
Sure, thanks for idea!
