Yes, I agree with this. AirBitz is a great, decentralized wallet. People should research it more and I think they will come to the same conclusion.

Great question. There are a number of ways that different aspects of bitcoin technology could be co-opted and erode (or not) the uniqueness/value of BTC.
One "threat" to BTC is the creation of a digital currency by a government or bank that would have the same frictionless transaction qualities of bitcoin, but lack the decentralized, anti-inflationary, non-governmental, etc. qualities.
Here's a passage from Great Chain of Numbers by Tim Swanson, he's quoting Preston Byrne, an Adam Smith Institute fellow:
"The UK could create a state-backed cryptocurrency - cryptosterling - tomorrow. Just write it, ensure only the Bank of England can mine it, issue everyone in the country with a private key, trade it for cash and deposits on a 1:1 basis over six months and replace national insurance numbers with a metal card containing the corresponding public key. Paying salaries and taxes, and claiming benefits, would be as simple as scanning a QR code and a bit of online monitoring; we could abolish the welfare bureaucracy overnight and save vast quantities of expenditure.”
“Such a currency would be superior to any other form of legal tender,” Byrne says: “imagine being able to see every transaction conducted globally in sterling in real time, all while possessing the benefits of any other crypto, including security, transparency, speed, irreversibility, and low cost. It would also have the benefit of being able to be tinkered with as the state would control the majority, if not all, of the hashpower on the network and have knowledge of at least some of the private keys. This is useful, for example, to reverse proven fraud, rescind a contract or engage in quantitative easing - arguably things any state needs to be able to do in order to maintain civilisation.”
The cryptosterling that Byrne proposes has many of the philosophical qualities and underlying economic theories detested by some bitcoiners, but it also has the digital fluency qualities championed by others.

I would follow up by saying that the likelihood of a major nation implementing a digital currency in the next decade is slim to none. The political hurdles (especially in the Eurozone) would be quite difficult to overcome.

I think a lot of the criticism on r/bitcoin for BitReserve stems from its founder Halsey Minor's dubious history (bankruptcy, etc.) and his skeptical remarks on the future of bitcoin.
When Anthony Watson quit his Nike gig to join Bitreserve he said “I’ll be surprised if Bitcoin is here in five years. It’s a means to an end.”
I felt his performance in this segment was deserving of criticism for his jumbling of figures and awkward and inaccurate description of the BTC market cap: "“Bitcoin today currently is the US dollar value equivalent value augmented, er aggregated is about 3.5 to 5.5 billion depending on who you speak to.”
He also did a poor job of describing Bitreserve's service, which is quite slick and unique.
I was happy to see them get coverage as well. I wish he could have delivered a more compelling pitch.

Here's a passage that stuck with me from Black Swan:
One day in December 2003, when Saddam Hussein was captured, Bloomberg News flashed the following headline at 13:01: U.S. TREASURIES RISE; HUSSEIN CAPTURE MAY NOT CURB TERRORISM.
Whenever there is a market move, the news media feel obligated to give the “reason.” Half an hour later, they had to issue a new headline. As these U.S. Treasury bonds fell in price (they fluctuate all day long, so there was nothing special about that), Bloomberg News had a new reason for the fall: Saddam’s capture (the same Saddam). At 13:31 they issued the next bulletin: U.S. TREASURIES FALL; HUSSEIN CAPTURE BOOSTS ALLURE OF RISKY ASSETS.
So it was the same capture (the cause) explaining one event and its exact opposite. Clearly, this can’t be; these two facts cannot be linked.”

Somehow they're both right about each other.

You know, I hated Taleb when I was first introduced to him through his feud with Sam Harris. He's a horrible speaker and often times his writing suffers from the safe schizophrenic shifting from one idea to another, but ultimately I found his ideas important and his arrogant humor at times enjoyable. 
He's got a very high functioning BS detector, especially when it comes to sniffing out statisticians that wade into waters they shouldn't be. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 07:20:21
I suggest reading any and all of Taleb's books (Antifragile, Black Swan, Fooled by Randomness) and you'll realize most people, especially the experts have no idea what they're talking about regarding ANY market.

Many self proclaimed analysts are making some bucks by writing editorials for the NY Times and selling books (Paul Krugman, etc.). 
I highly suggest reading Antifragile by Nassim Taleb. It will change the focus of your attention away from prediction (which is impossible) and toward analysis of a system's ability to get stronger through crises (which are inevitable).

This guy and his ilk (Force, Bridges, et al.) should definitely be condemned. The investigators that caught him should also be lauded. Special Agent Tigran Gambaryan from the IRS wrote the affidavit against Force and displayed some awesome detective work. It's a good read, if you haven't seen it yet.

Hey, thanks. I adjusted the article. From my understanding the original 50 cannot be spent, but the BTC added after that can? Is that right?

Hey, thanks for the clarification. I changed "founder" to "chairman" to reflect what he has on his Twitter bio.
edit: changed to "the self-proclaimed (perhaps sarcastically) “chairman” and leading pro sponsor of bitcoin poker site Seals with Clubs"

Thanks, these are good recommendations.

Great site. Exactly what I was looking for.
