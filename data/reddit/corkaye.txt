i thought it was the demand that pushed the price not the amount of people that own it
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:28:24
wouldnt they get it or alot of it back upon its rise again? and then make XXXX% on the end sale

"Bezos gained around $US2.4 ($3) billion in one day alone -- "
"Amazon founder and CEO Jeff Bezos sold 1 million shares in his company, whose stock is at an all-time high."

that seems like fake news. A hidden AI system in the web created BTC so humans would give it more computing power lol. There would of been better easier ways for a Super AI system to achieve this. 
But there isnt any AI that advanced ATM,

ok i must of misread
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:05:53
Yeah i can see what you are saying
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:26:22
i never copy pasted this, and i dont know why you would attack someone thats asking a question,  and especially with what you said being incorrect.
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:18:06
didnt the owner of amazon print 1b profit in one day, so im sure this could be possible. maybe i should stop thinking, or maybe you should? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:18:52
Its hard to see btc becoming the main currency, 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:21:49
Yeah, some people kill their own kids for less money. My question wasnt regarding their morals, just whether or not thats possible
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:32:04
there is other motives besides profit if someone did this, \
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:23:58
Yeah, be worse if they all worked together 
@_date: 2017-12-02 18:47:19
well imagine if/when governments and banks get on board with btc
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:01:10
Yeah i agree, its very hard to imagine where btc is in 10yrs, it could be gone nxt year or overtaking the world or somewhere in between.
There are dangers where it can increase the disparicy between the very rich and the rest
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:29:24
i have been buying btc since 2013 mate,

If you can determine all of my understanding from this one post you have the greatest detective skills in the world. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:53:58
a few things ive read and already knew
-you cant attach an owner to a wallet
-if someone who holds 1% of the total coins and sold all of them it causes a significant crash
i have a question about the below senario.
The "creator" of the coin, secretly is holding supposedly a big amount of coins, split among XXX amount of wallets.
Been selling and buying frequently to drive the price up to get people to buy while gaining a greater amount of coins over time.
This is to set up their power play
People are over confident now, many are waiting for the next dip
The "creator" sets up the next big dip by unloading 1%, 
when the coin starts to recover and the volume of buys increases
The "creator" dumps all of their holdings causing a collapse
runs of with all the money

FB operates entirely different, BTC has no real world value, its value is determined through supply and demand 
yeah but would people buy if millions just lost billions/trillions, plus no one would trust it again, 
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:19:57
yeah i know the name, but they aren't 100% sure from what i gathered, point me to where its 100% him

Bitcoin will not become a predominant  globally accepted currency replacing current forms. Im accepting wagers that this wont happen 
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:06:31
im not entirely sure what you mean.
protect their investment? 
by spending money they've put into an investment, lowering their overall potential gains on that investment
@_date: 2017-11-21 05:40:48
 for people to make money, someone is losing it
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:27:06
i didnt mean store it indefinately, i meant store it as value and sell for profit.
not buy it and use it to purchase goods on random occasions  
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:16:34
why would you use btc for goods and purchases for? its too volatile to be used in this manner ATM, its main use should be for the storage of value.
imagine leaving home to go to the shop with your btc atm card, get stuck in a little traffic, get to the bottle shop, grab a bottle of wine and line up to pay for it. after 3 mins of being stuck in the line you finally make it to the counter to purchase your wine. you swipe your btc card enter your pin, only to find out you have insufficient funds and that btc dropped 30% from the time you left your house. 
i wouldnt be buying and holding btc to use for purchases, that is a long way off from happening and probably wont happen ever with btc, in that respect.
