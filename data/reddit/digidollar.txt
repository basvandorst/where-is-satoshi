Just around the corner aye....you cant beat the security of BTC and LTC due to their massive network of users. These other coins are built on hype preying on noob "investors" into "tech" and other catchy words.
I like the sound of these other coins and have invested accordingly,but only a small % compared to say LTC or BTC
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:27:28
Have any of you guys actually used Litecoin before?
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:57:24
It does not matter if you think its "lies" LTC is designed to help Bitcoin scale,why do you guys ALWAYS refuse it? look at the shit storm you created when you did nothing and BTRASH was created? could have just supported LTC from the start.....Just saying...
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:28:21
does it work more like litecoin now?
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:37:17
If you are wealthy you must live like a wealthy person=security.

Shitblocks is another P+D
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:08:03
Sounds like all talk and hype and no exchanges or real uses for that matter? Unlike Bitcoin and Litecoin which pretty much shit on everything else

"I've not seen any altcoin that can achieve high transaction speed without being centralized"
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:32:15
You got me....
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:24:47
LTC is far from a shitcoin, redditor for 3 months lol....It's the only thing that could save bitcoin right now...pity that the bitcoin community is so fucking up themselves lol....hence the creation of shitcoincash.
@_date: 2018-01-01 12:01:36
Calm now, my bad, so much fud being spread about LTC and BTC its driving me crazy lol....I can see you guys have it worse here though.
Happy new year bud!
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:59:26
LTC is still cheaper AND it's not trying to compete with bitcoin, only trying to compliment it....for users of the biggest crypto currency you guys are a bit behind I feel.
@_date: 2018-01-01 10:05:05
Over at Litecoin sub we would love to work more closely with the Bitcoin community....Its a one way kind of love though....
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:52:05
They use that stupid reason in the LTC sub too, with LN AND LTC you guys will be sweet....remember, we are here to help you guys scale right?
@_date: 2018-01-01 09:49:53
I see a few LTC sprouts coming up along side that BTC tree
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:21:10
"next google" fucking Litecoin...are you guys not paying attention around here? come over and browse r/litecoin for a bit.

"We have multi-currency bank accounts today, with 15 currencies available on your phone instantly in real-time, so it is not that difficult for us to take that technology and make that a loyalty point store. It shouldn't be that difficult for us to then add crypto-currencies to it, and whatever other means of payment transfers people might want."
@_date: 2015-06-17 15:35:39
litecoin....that is all.
@_date: 2015-06-01 09:07:45

@_date: 2017-12-07 15:12:52
thank god you posted that,because the original hype around bitcoin was it being used as a digital currency no? so its now just a store of wealth yes? so then why not embrace litecoin now as its essentially bitcoin 2.0... digital symbiosis people...bitcoin/litecoin like it should be.
@_date: 2015-06-16 15:55:02
come on chikun

my favourite part...."The catch-22 is people buy Bitcoins because they think the price will go to infinity and beyond once everybody uses them, but they don't spend their own Bitcoins because they think the price will go to infinity and beyond once everybody else uses them. And so nobody uses them."
@_date: 2018-08-23 04:35:31
stop talking about these stupid ETF's already far out....
@_date: 2018-08-04 14:15:09
Didn't Litecoin adopt Segwit before Bitcoin? pretty much paving the way for Bitcoin to move forward?  
@_date: 2014-12-26 03:10:30
just ignore it and it will go away....
@_date: 2014-12-04 14:33:24
holy wow cheese
@_date: 2014-12-26 03:16:49
so how will you guys feel after 2015 comes and goes and still no one cares about bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-12-04 14:28:24
there seems to be a complete media blackout on bitcoin in Australia?am i wrong?
@_date: 2014-12-30 03:46:23
yeah i agree,im no tech head but ive used bitcoin and litecoin....im all in on litecoin because it "feels" better to use....bitcoins just made me nervous hahaha.i couldnt care about features or whatever....
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:17:23
do nothing?
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:21:28
trying to get rich quick will never work...did you loan the money?
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:49:50
getting rich quick never works.....
@_date: 2015-01-14 09:16:40
haha and you guys were saying that litecoin was dead hahaha looks like bitcoin is really dead
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:44:49
its going lower...
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:09:44
dude....get the fuck over it,alts are here to stay.im fully in on litecoin and i still like bitcoin so WTF? i bought bitcoins in 2013 and traded them for litecoins, bazaam.
@_date: 2015-01-14 12:53:36
i buy LTC direct from BTC markets aswell bloody good aussie exchange
@_date: 2015-01-14 13:04:27
i totally agree with this and think this is how crypto will start being widely used....i mean wheres the incentives for customers right now?
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:41:48
@_date: 2015-01-11 14:22:58
so if litecoin is useless and has no "innovation" like you bikcoiners say....yet its basically a clone ...as you say...then wouldnt you basically be saying shitcoin...i mean bitcoin has about the same amount of "innovation"?
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:18:44
do you guys really believe bitcoin will go back over $1000?hahahahahahahahahahahaha
@_date: 2017-08-23 03:14:30
why are you guys not using litecoin for small transactions? i thought bitcoin users were "informed"?? 
@_date: 2018-10-25 08:26:09
litecoin would be the obvious choice
@_date: 2018-10-25 08:59:48
@_date: 2017-01-02 13:00:58
yeah buy litecoin if you want to get rich quick
@_date: 2018-10-25 08:49:03
Nope...huge dump on January 1, I know you guys would like to see history repeating so this would likely happen first just as it did in 2015 after 2014 was supposed to be the biggest year EVA for Bitcoin the digital payment coin........
@_date: 2018-10-25 08:51:59
Bitcoin still trying to find a "use case" what ever happened to Bitcoins "killer app" or is that so like 2014?
@_date: 2016-12-28 05:19:55
haha love it
@_date: 2018-06-25 10:02:43
Add another one to the list in a few years bois....
@_date: 2016-12-28 05:23:18
that should read bitcoin or litecoin....just saying
@_date: 2016-12-28 05:13:32
don't forget good ol litecoin.....good chance for profit there and at $4 each whats to lose......$4?
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:41:27
yeah but you have to share some with LTC this time hey bois....don't be too greedy
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:26:20
r/litecoin welcomes you brother
@_date: 2015-08-28 03:31:21
dreamers gonna dream
@_date: 2017-04-23 02:24:00
you guys cant deny LTC now.....you can still talk shit about it though....as always.
@_date: 2018-02-28 16:10:26
Ive noticed....But that Dominance is below 50%
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:57:51
40% isn't king...but still it's Bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-04-09 12:56:07
i think this is huge news actually....even though im fully invested in litecoin,this is a very good sign that the crypto markets are moving in the right direction....if telstra comes on board you know bitcoin is going mainstream....just the fact they are watching closely is pretty fucking exciting really.If only they would accept lite payments along with bit payments..
@_date: 2015-04-28 18:02:36
have a look at Litecoin if that worries you...created by charles lee,ex google employee....
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:59:21
everybody from bitcoin just move into litecoin....no need for Btrash then.
@_date: 2017-05-31 05:19:21
yay at least 1 person with a brain
@_date: 2017-05-30 18:41:32
no litecoin?
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:25:49
yep...litecoin has been tested.....and we found it works better than bitcoin....who would have thought a copy of bitcoin designed to be an improvement would actually well....be better? no one here i am guessing hahaha.
@_date: 2017-07-20 18:34:14
bit like your attitude....
@_date: 2017-05-11 09:35:53
no one?.....wow that's rude i always thought i was someone?
