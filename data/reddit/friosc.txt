This one is false. Bitcoin is run by non-anonymous mining pools. Quite few of them actually.

Bitcoin isn't even anti centralization, so it doesn't matter
@_date: 2018-10-21 15:31:34
Probably not. The cost of mining will likely skyrocket and trading will plummet. Mining will halt completely because there're no incentives to do it anymore. Without mining bitcoin is nothing.

He has admitted himself that you shouldn't listen to old men with gray hair for future predictions.
While he's incorrect with many of his predictions in the article he also raises many important points and challenges of the internet that is still relevant to this day.

The price has stayed in $6,500 range for months now. Maybe miners are getting closer to their profitable margin?

And they say LN can handle 1,000,000 tps. Good luck updating the state of the network 1,000,000 times per second
@_date: 2018-03-16 08:36:16
Nope. This is just a way to give some guidance on how to find the route. Doesn't solve the problem of needing to update the state of the graph after each transaction. 
@_date: 2018-03-16 06:53:05
On a map it's possible to use A* search because we can use the direction we're traveling as a clue on where to go. For example, if we know our destination is north from us, we can start by looking at roads going north first.
Maps are also much simpler because roads seldom branch out to more than 3 paths. Have you ever seen a road branch out to more than 100 different paths?
The lightning network is much more complicated. We cannot in a helpful way organize the network so it functions as a map. We can organize it now when the number of nodes are very few, but this will become almost impossible if LN reaches 1 million nodes.
@_date: 2018-03-16 10:40:14
If LN developers had an idea they would have proposed a solution in the whitepaper.
And your idea will only reward a very centralized network. It is as most optimal if there's one node that is connected to all other nodes. 
But congratulations on finding out yourself that centralization is a necessity for a scalable payment network.

Here we have more interesting facts about Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-16 13:53:42
Still doesn't solve the problem that the network state must be updated after each transaction (which is promised to be over 1,000,000 per second), and it needs to ensure that the found route has enough fund to support the transaction, and ensure noone else will use the route during the transaction.

What do you mean things are not free? :O

When it reaches mass adoption, which probably will not happen any time soon. Not unless we figured out how to scale Bitcoin far beyond 7 transactions per second.

It's more that there are no convincing reason for the masses to adopt cryptocurrencies yet.

Proof of Stake is basically betting that my validator script will run exactly like the scripts used by all other stakers. Think about what will happen if there is just any inconsitency between the Linux and the Windows version of a popular validator script. This will enable attacks at a magnitude greater than the DAO attack.

The game needs to be really really popular if a coin is going to ever come out of it. You know how expensive mining is?
