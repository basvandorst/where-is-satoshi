This irony, lol.
And why did you invest in Bitcoin? Prob. At 20k at the peak hype and now you stick to it because you are too sad losing money.
It's just not a SMART investment since Bitcoin has not a single indicator that it will raise because there are just too many problems with it, the idea behind everything is nice but it won't work anywhere near and if something will be changed it prob. Will not be Bitcoin at the top.

And what has it to do with 10,000% gains? I never mentioned it and besides that, yes I think bitcoin will not ever be used much by the population, maybe we will get a new finanical thing but I dont believe that it will be bitcoin.

Imagine EXPECTING 10,000% gains. This Bitcoin community is rly delusional sometimes.

I mean if you bought the 14k before the peak, yes. If you bought it afterwards when it dropped it was a bad investement at this moment.

Sure cheap in 6 months :DD
@_date: 2019-04-02 02:29:49
Nah, It was overall a bad Investment.

True "Hey i buy it but wont use it so no one cares about it heh"
@_date: 2019-04-03 03:13:22
It's still a nice amount of money where you could have fun in your life, travel a bit to see something in the world etc.

Well, shouldve sold at 20k when it was obv. going down.
@_date: 2019-01-29 06:23:20
I mean there are prob. People out there who made millions with selling In-game Currencys but that are sites who buy it and sell it again and are huge. So prob. Not many but there are enough who make 10k+
@_date: 2018-11-29 02:08:32
Wont happen because too many act like you and dont use it to buy things.
@_date: 2018-02-02 08:13:35
Never because the coin is garbage in this point

What are you even talking? You are annoying because you take a Meme a bit too serious
@_date: 2019-05-27 13:01:09
Not rly. Maybe in major regions which are developed more and have news around them 24 7 and are inside the internet all day.
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:27:48
You are annoying.
@_date: 2019-05-15 22:12:11
Because it was always like that.
