I think most rational users agree that the blocksize should increase.  It should just be done in a safe way with strong consensus since it must be a hard fork.

Anyone can be a hub with lightning network, it only requires a single on-chain transaction to open a channel without any 'trust' on behalf of either channel endpoint.
If one participant does not play by the rules, funds are recovered securely and without any cooperation or mediation by transmitting a single additional on-chain transaction.  
If both participants do play by the rules, that single on-chain transaction can act as a secure channel for pretty much any number of off-chain transactions.

Even if fees do hit 1k, node operators should be able to re-coup that through lightning network fees.
More likely, the lightning network frees up space on the blockchain decreasing competition for space and reduces the bitcoin fee.  The bitcoin block size should be increased as the cost of storage space drops.  However larger blocks is insufficient without something like lightning.. it just doesn't make sense for everyone running a full bitcoin node to store txn data for each cup of coffee purchased by a bitcoin user.  That just isn't scale-able.

So there could be infinitely many chains and infinite code, so which code is law?

The people holding btc are typically not the ones directly lending it. Exchanges have some amount of btc which backs the btc in customer accounts, and this is what is lent out to shorts. 
The exchanges themselves have are incentivized to do this because the interest and txn fees are basically free money to them.  This is very common and is done with stock brokers as well. 
Shorting can also be done indirectly using the new bitcoin futures contracts.

Did you use that password anywhere else?  It's also possible that they compromised the database of some other website.

Not really, the root problem is there's no global timestamp other than the blockchain itself.  That means that a double-spend tx made after an original tx could be the one to make it into the blockchain assuming neither have yet.  It's all up to whoever mines the next block, and the miners are likely to pick the one with the higher tx fee.

Thanks for investigating, it's useful to know that the current protocol prioritizes based on time of receipt vs fee.

Not really, a smart double spend wouldn't send both at the same time (which I agree is easy to detect nearly instantly).  Instead you would send one transaction with a low transaction fee to the vendor.  You get the goods (assuming the vendor accepts zero-conf transactions) and walk out.
Now you check the blockchain.  If your transaction made it in already then you're SOL.  But if it didn't (due to the low tx fee), then you doublespend with a much higher tx fee, guaranteeing it that new tx will be in the next block.
The beauty of this attack is that you get to choose whether or not to 'steal' after you've made the transaction.

This isn't quite true.  The market software doesn't set the current price a touch higher when someone wants to buy.  
Instead, imagine an auction where the only good being sold is bitcoin.  All the buyers on one side hold up signs with the highest price they are willing to pay, known as the bid.  Similarly, the sellers hold up signs with the lowest price they are willing to sell for (their ask).  These "lines" of buyers and sellers, and the prices and quantities they are selling is actually represented by the bottom graph on   These buyers and sellers have entered what are called 'limit' orders since the buyers are only willing to buy below their limit, and the sellers are only willing to sell above their limit.
Normally, this results in a spread, with the bid &lt; ask, and no transaction taking place.  
Then come the market orders.  Imagine some guy comes to the auction and just really wants to buy 100 bitcoin.  The auctioneer will act as matchmaker and point him towards the seller with the current lowest price.  However, suppose that seller only has 50 bitcoin.  The buyer wants 100 so the auctioneer points him to the next seller with a slightly higher price where he buys the remaining 50.  
The price you see on exchanges is simply the price that the last transaction occurred at, and here, the price just went up, not because the market software decided it should, but because there are no more sellers left willing to sell at the lower price.
An exchange is really just a simple matchmaker.  It is the participants that dictate the price.

I’ve recently found the opposite and am close to switching.  This sub now has zero posts about the tech, it’s all price memes, hodl posts, and echoing about how right everyone is with no actual evidence. 
No one here discusses when/if blocks size has to increase, the limitations of lightning network, how to properly secure bitcoins, etc. 
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:42:36
Sure those could all be factors, but what about Bitcoin slowly losing consensus?
There used to be a single Bitcoin, now there are many chains sharing the Bitcoin name and blockchain.  The goal of mining is to establish consensus, and the assumption was that people (non-malicious participants) will generally 'accept' the chain with the most PoW.  
If that assumption turns out to be false, does Bitcoin really work?
@_date: 2018-11-19 20:33:29
Exactly, and if people are basing their acceptance on media outlets and social networks, then blockchain in general doesn't have much value.  The entire point of Bitcoin's blockchain and mining incentives is to provide decentralized consensus.

The fix for “MCU fooling” is very unconvincing.  The root cause here is *trusting* a general purpose processor to dump its memory over serial to a trusted secure element. 
This is an architectural flaw that really requires a hardware change to properly address. There are many ways for the faster MCU to be dishonest via malicious code and “spoof” parts of its memory dump. 
Very unlikely that these hacky changes (throwing in random CRC checks) prevent this class of attack.

there’s always a limit
@_date: 2018-07-10 01:53:23
Unlike with the bitcoin network, no one knows for sure since only those nodes involved in the transactions see the amounts. It is possible to guess based on changes in channel capacities, but lightning in general has better privacy. 
I’ve personally transferred over $100 back and forth between nodes so the total is likely way over 300. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:10:44
There are lots of limits:
- Ability to broadcast channels to all participants
- Channel capacities and balances
- Each node must currently have knowledge of a large percentage of the network in order to generate a payment route. 
- The number of on-chain transactions required to maintain balanced channel connectivity 
I’ve also been running a lightning node for awhile and it is quite difficult to get incoming connections. This severely limits most nodes from accepting any kind of payment. Is there a good solve for that?
@_date: 2018-07-29 15:31:23
I’d say there’s no limit if I wanted to be misleading and/or naive. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 16:36:51
Right, routing of the underlying network always imposes some limit. 
There are also limits indirectly related to  For example, what rate of channel creation does the underlying blockchain support?  Do those channels become unbalanced, necessitating on-chain txns? Can a sufficient number of channels be broadcast/gossiped to enough nodes to keep routing reliable?

People can be pro-bitcoin but still believe it is overpriced relative to current adoption, value it is bringing, etc.
