Had to reply to such an idiotic comment and your comparison to the car industry. Britain was the largest exporter of cars in the world way into the 50's and it's decline had nothing to do with this weird flag carrying scenario you have just mentioned.

time to buy more - so glad i had a good stop loss going
@_date: 2017-01-04 14:14:22
won't really crash unless price drops below 1000
@_date: 2013-11-13 18:12:59
Im in the UK, sorry, should have said that
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:01:02
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:32:34
ah the aristocracy :(
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:25:43
i'll buy a very very small amount!
@_date: 2013-12-02 15:20:16
KRAKEN FTW
@_date: 2017-06-14 18:17:22
Why post stuff like this
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:01:54
me too, would you actually sell some to me?
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:52:18
Yeh, the reason I did though is because the price was good and he had a lot of positive feedback (although not bitcoin related). I spoke with him for a while and decided he was legit... stupid really
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:11:15
If you wanna use paypal you can try virwox - this is my referall link  , but just remove the end part if you dont want to use it
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:30:02
that makes no sense
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:30:34
Theres other cryptocurrencies like litecoin etc, these don't cost as much as of now and try and improve on Bitcoin....but they're not Bitcoin so their value is not rising as fast.
@_date: 2013-11-27 10:48:07
Virwox still works - does have some fees attached though - good referral system which can get you back a descent amount of money to compensate 
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:15:42
I guess, im now definitely more aware
@_date: 2013-12-11 12:02:15
I love trippy works like your second one. If I was an early adopter i would definitely splash out on it.... but i wasn't :p 
good work, keep it up, im sure some one will buy one
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:52:08
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:47:48
Fair enough, not trying to put you down if its honest and its great people are spreading the Bitcoin word. There are just so many scammers in Bitcoin as it is unregulated!
@_date: 2013-11-11 08:40:42
its a phishing site, fuck you
@_date: 2013-11-26 11:07:55
forgive me if im wrong, but surely you would just print out a bunch of paper wallets and when you want to pay someone load it with your phone?
@_date: 2013-11-11 14:03:29
yes please, could do with some BTC! :P
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:18:42
i've added it in my phones calendar, to be honest in a year i wont ask for any money. It will just be interesting. Anyway thanks for being so generous to people
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:12:50
Virwox allows it, thats my referral link, remove the ending if you dont want to use that. Instant paypal or debit card, that and vault of satoshi are the only legit ways
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:28:36
why do you regret buying them?!?
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:50:57
for first times though the maximum is £64
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:13:42
I bought $315 for one bitcoin two weeks ago, with a bit of faucets according to blockchain it is now worth $390 although other sites would value it &gt;$400
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:37:06
Yet you say that last year you were using paypal.....
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:02:13
Are you asking how much i invested or how much its worth now?
@_date: 2013-11-20 12:09:25
kraken imo
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:04:15
i only just made a reddit account, just for this thread i wish i had made one earlier! :(
@_date: 2013-11-13 16:24:19
impossible question
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:16:12
fishing for tips?
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:13:22
Also if anyone can tell me how to put returns in reddit formatting that would be great!
@_date: 2013-11-08 15:13:26
Deal, i'll make a note of this.
@_date: 2013-11-12 08:47:13
I understand that they are buying them - that is how you can scam people out of their money. All they need to do is claim to paypal they never received a bitcoin and paypal will refund them from the sellers account....
Whats in place to stop this?
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:50:26
could try virwox, they accept paypal aswell, i could help you along there
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:02:53
knew i was gonna make some sort of mistake whilst criticising someone 
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:41:44
Sorry for sounding suspicious but you just said this is the first year you have has the website due to demand. But on the blog it says last year you were using Paypal but ran into trouble. Im confused
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:21:30
namecoin follows the same principles as bitcoin but adds on a new layer. As far as i understand this is storing websites in the blockchain using the .bit extension ie google.bit  this prevents the websites from ever being able to be removed or taken down, only traded. It could be the future of the internet, at least for sites like silkroad
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:11:26
man just use virwox 
thats my referral but you dont need to use it.
Its instant and you can use card or paypal
@_date: 2013-11-08 19:49:38
couldnt be bothered to read too much but looks like a pyramid scam to me
@_date: 2013-11-29 16:13:40
i'm home now so no websense!
I'll tell you the story of how i found out about bitcoins. I was studdying for my art a level and ended up doing some research on medicine in the British Museum. I was disheartened so went and started exploring, ending up in the money room. There I saw a beautiful casascius coin. Immediately i went home to buy one, i didnt want a digital bitcoin, i wanted a REAL bitcoin. I went on ebay and saw the price. £200!!! No way. Thats too much for a 17 year old I said, so i didnt buy it. What a mistake! Anyway, thats my story
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:49:16
thats unnecessarily harsh
@_date: 2013-11-18 09:45:36
What was the price when you bought?
@_date: 2013-12-09 11:09:25
@_date: 2013-12-09 11:36:27
Put your BTC in a paper wallet, i wanted to sell but thinking of the hassle made me reconsider!
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:09:54
apparently your not allowed to do this
@_date: 2013-11-07 18:54:14
i think i'll probably head down for a bit 
@_date: 2013-12-11 09:11:22
and you need a verified paypal account...
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:22:41
where about's are you based! :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 09:13:14
I cant get on twitter at work, what does it say!?!?
@_date: 2013-12-12 15:06:33
what do you mean?
@_date: 2013-11-09 19:02:34
in my opinion you will kick your self more if you dont invest and they become the global currency. Losing $300 is really frustrating but you'll live
@_date: 2013-11-07 13:41:04
thanks for all the info, final thing, is litecoin much smaller than bitcoin? Why does it exist?
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:51:34
its still limited to 21 million like bitcoin and can go down to 8 decimal places
@_date: 2013-12-05 10:34:53
no it dosen't
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:24:10
i'm worried that the longer i leave it the harder its going to be for me to get in on it though. Buy trust no one i assume you're saying everyone is in it for themselves?
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:28:25
Although if someone has never had any bitcoins I suggest giving it to them
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:18:11
it goes into your blockchain wallet assigned to your reddit account, if you don't have one one is created for you
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:39:25
Just applied for two tier - not instant! Looking around the website though and i do like the look of the place. How come it only allows some sites?
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:29:09
your like r/bitcoins resident dickhead aren't you...
@_date: 2013-12-06 16:14:50
Hi, kraken, like you mentioned, is where you should go. Verification in 2 days or so and you dont need to send them any info like passports etc
@_date: 2013-11-07 12:32:46
Cheers for the info, 
Can you tell me why i shouldnt use paypal/mt gox. and eBay?
Where should i make an account? I feel really stressed as i suddenly realised i should of got on bitcoins when i first heard about them a year ago and now i just want any amount in my wallet. I just put a bid in for 0.01 on ebay before you posted this :'( probably quite stupid of me in retrospect. Im worried i am going to make rash decisions!
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:36:08
I sent you 0.5 bitcoins, enjoy!
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:23:46
It'll be funny if cool wallet names become valuable in a bitcoin future!
@_date: 2013-11-29 11:19:29
that was kinda the point of my post, btc offers something as it is the first  and therefore has widespread usage, all the others (bar namecoin) are clones which attempt to do exactly the same thing
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:50:33
I asked the same question when i bought my first bitcoin at $300 less than two weeks ago, i'm happy i bought in. Now is still early
@_date: 2013-11-19 15:27:08
 just got scammed of £220, would make me feel a bit happier
@_date: 2013-11-28 15:15:49
@_date: 2013-11-20 11:08:53
I use kraken, really like the interface. Also last week it was dealing with 100btc a day, thats more like 400 now and rising.
Only problem is depositing money, my bank (uk) charges a fee as it is international
@_date: 2013-11-22 10:38:29
fuck off, no ones going to your scam site
@_date: 2013-11-08 18:41:55
I have no idea what im looking at
@_date: 2013-11-11 15:37:35
interesting read, thanks
@_date: 2013-11-19 14:53:46
Also this was the first installment, I was going to pay another £430
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:15:48
@_date: 2013-11-13 20:44:10
did people actually get bitcoins out of this?
@_date: 2013-11-15 10:51:39
You need to have an online wallet - use blockchain,
scan the private qr code into it to get your funds then generate a wallet in kraken and send the funds using blockchain.
I'm using kraken and i like it.
Any questions - ask
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:12:03
or try kraken, they have pretty quick verification
@_date: 2013-11-07 16:11:54
Ok, i'm new so i didn't know people did that, my bad
@_date: 2013-11-11 21:24:51
thought paypal didnt allow stuff to do with bitcoin?
lus whats to stop you saying you 'never recieved' the bitcoin and claiming your money back?
