There's little room for failure on their part.  The Bitcoin blockchain is fully transparent and traceable and mixing coins doesn't change that.  Anyone who has coins blocked because they are associated with the sanctioned addresses in some way will have to go through a process to be cleared and that isn't failure.  That is exactly what they want to happen.  They want to follow all links and find the ones who are laundering money for the Iranians.
  
You keep saying Bitcoin is fungible and coinjoin makes coins fungible and this is factually incorrect.

You cannot get clean coins by mixing.  End of story.  I appreciate your enthusiasm for fungibility and privacy but you are talking our of your ass and that helps no one.

I know how it works and I know it does not provide fungibility.  the Wasabi Wallet website is lying to you when they claim they have made BTC fungible.  I won't continue to argue with a wall.
  
Coinjoin doesn't "clean" anything.  LN doesn't clean anything.

I see it more as a test and one that cryptocurrencies will ultimately solve because it is programmable money.  I would like to see more privacy introduced to Bitcoin in order to achieve fungibility but I'm not holding my breath.  I think it is more likely a fork will do it as a marketing ploy and that could end up being good for Bitcoin.  But there are other projects working on this problem and doing a good job right now.

Price likely lost steam because of the news that is spreading about the US Treasury sanctioning addresses.  There is a lot of time spent around here trying to push FUD and stifle adoption but this is the real deal.  We have been talking about what would happen if the government did this since Bitcoin started and now we are here.

Using a tumbler just taints the coins in this case and makes it more likely and exchange will freeze them if you deposit them on their platform.

The forks are shitcoins.

This would be considered interfering in an investigation and could bring charges to you if you do it and they can link this comment to you.  
  
Bitcoin is not fungible and wasabi doesn't make your coins fungible.

Fuck off, troll.

Bitcoin made me rich and I don't expect those things.  I'm still holding some bits but have mostly moved into monero.  I think a bear market is good and will force a lot of people to take a closer look at and abandon some lesser projects.  Nobody should expect to "get rich quick" with any investment.

Their assessment is less than intelligent as is your response to me.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:27:58
Go talk to Greg Maxwell who created coinjoin and ask him if using coinjoin cleans your coins, lol.
@_date: 2018-11-28 21:39:29
They are calling on exchanges to freeze coins associated with those addresses so they can be investigated.  The short answer is yes, a coinjoin with these coins will taint your outputs and your funds could be frozen on an exchange like Coinbase until an investigation happens and shows you have nothing to do with the Iranians.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:05:30


This is the only thing you said that was right.  Unrelated users are going to be affected if they mixed coins or received coins associated with these addresses.  There is no legal precedent protecting your mixed coins.  Any link to these addresses will taint your coins.  Bitcoin is not fungible and this situation is further proof of that.
  
If you mixed coins with coins that came from these addresses, your funds will likely be frozen if they are on a US exchange and you could be waiting years for them to get around to investigating and discovering you are just some dude who mixed his coins thinking it makes them "clean".  It does not.

There would be no reason to do that since they own the addresses and can attest to ownership of the wallet.  They will freeze the bitcoin sent to the wallet and move on.  If you sent to it to a customers address that they control, then it gets messy for the customer because they need to figure out what is going on so the customer would likely be blocked.
  
The way it works on exchanges is that you have your own addresses that they control and they have their own wallets that they consolidate coins into.  So if they receive tainted coins directly to one of their cold wallets nothing is likely to happen.  But sending to a customer generated address would likely bring action.  So the only way to really mess with them would be to get a hold of the customer addresses and tainting those but that just hurts the customer and Bitcoin in the end.

Your comment is just another troll comment meant to antagonize.  
@_date: 2018-11-27 21:58:23
Nobody is making money doing nothing.  Not even thieves.  Anyone who gets rich from Bitcoin did it by obtaining Bitcoin and holding it.  That involves both money and considerable risk.  Since money doesn't grow on trees that means the vast majority worked for their money and then took considerable risk buying Bitcoin with it.  That is the exact opposite of "doing nothing".
  
Your posts are low quality attempts to troll.

This is incorrect, Tether is not unpegging from the USD.
  


   


  
The exchange Bitfinex announced: 
  
So an exchange will allow some float but we don't know what that will look like.
