Why would you marry (or stay with) someone who doesn't have the mental capacity to understand these concepts (at least on a basic level)? PLUS, doesn't even have the "open mind" to try?
I seriously don't get how smart dudes can marry dingbat women. I guess that pussy is strong stuff.

This is how it should be.

Why be with or stay with someone where there are things you "can't mention"? He's into it. She should support that.
"Buy her stuff" is not the answer.

I appreciate partners that (at least pretend to) give a fuck.
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:01:31
Yeah goes both ways.

Putting in the time? On a basic level you can explain it over dinner.

You need a new partner.

Buy toys/clothes for children who wouldn't get anything otherwise. Heck, you could even deliver them yourself!

There's a hard rally coming.
