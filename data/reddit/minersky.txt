im also a newbie but i think thats irrelevant.  the issue here is that if you download an imposter app then im sure they have the coded so ANY address you send to directs to their wallet.  Another words if you are sending money from an imposter app then that text box is not linked to anything and the backend just sends it to their bitcoin address and your funds are theirs.

I feel you man when CSGL went down i started betting with bitcoin and now I'm learning everything about this currency. Sorry you gotta deal with this and how they have been stringing people along with late announcements and the site not opening up. At least you got this answer today and I believe you will be made whole one way or another. Lot of cynical people here to mess that up tho

 Not very savvy with code but new code makes me nervous and testing. Can you assure us that security isn't a factor while rolling out all this new tech.

Is it possible or ridiculous that Bitfinex will be buying coins from the hacker to keep compensating users. Like they are obv buying some coin and there's 120,000btc out there presumably waiting to be bought.

How does one invest?  Is there any documentation of investment?

Hi.  Just getting into bitcoin for the first time.  I was given recommendations of Coinbase and Mycellium wallet.  Are these reputable places?
@_date: 2016-07-24 22:38:53
Thanks, is that what bank you use?
@_date: 2016-07-25 14:03:14
OMG I need so much help please help me:
* I am trying to withdraw from a site that offers bitcoin transfer.  I'd like to send it to a mycellium account that I just opened yesterday.  Is this logical especially given that I just opened that account?
* How would I withdraw the funds from mycellium if I wanted to? I don't yet, but am I supposed to send it to a Bitcoin bank and withdraw from there to my bank account?
* I was originally recommended Coinbase, but I really don't like their site and I had major issues with them yesterday.  Then someone mentioned Circle as being the go-to now.  I'd like to know what bank is reputable that I could trust.
* I don't understand the technology, I don't understand how to keep your own wallet.  I want someone else to do that for me.  I just want to use a bank+wallet site and let them handle the security aspect.  Is this naive?
* To receive the money from this website they ask for the BTC address.  I'm assuming it's that gibberish on the mycelium request page.  Does that address stay static for sending me BTC or does it always change?
Thank you for all insight.  I'm ready to begin I just haven't learned enough to jump in and start having these funds moved around.

Thanks.  Can you recommend a bank?  I actually had issues signing up for Coinbase.  They wanted ID verification which I was happy to provide but then it gives an error missing billing_address, but there is LITERALLY NO FIELD to input billing address so you cannot verify.  I instantly felt like this site wasn't finished or fully tested.  I do need a bank though and I want to use mycellium in tangent with it.

Thanks for the answers &lt;3 but srsly the nearest Bitcoin ATM is in freaking NY City which is 4 hours away by train.
One more question.  I just opened the Mycelium account yesterday, it has my name but no ID verification.  If I move, say, $300 onto that wallet that seems very insecure.  Do y ou disagree?  But what are the odds that the bitcoin address could be a duplicate and someone else gets my transaction? lol.
