When I read this, my first thought jumped to NMC. I'm surprised how many times I will say "hey we can create a new chain which does..." just to realize namecoin is the end answer. The one disincentive for using namecoin is the need to use that currency in order to be able to update certain entries.
Namecoin would be a great proof of ownership transfer mechanism for larger items (e.g. house, car, appliances, computer) but it doesn't make sense to be spending namecoins for things which are low value or transfer ownership regularly. Currently an a new name costs 0.01 NMC (~$0.006), though we can expect the price of namecoin to increase with use of such a protocol.
