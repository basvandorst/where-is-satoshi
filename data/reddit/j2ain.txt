When’s the auction? Can’t find that in the court doc. 
@_date: 2018-01-23 06:20:25
Nope. We didn’t win. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 09:09:44
I meant 2018. Oops

Penning 2 months now...

Be patient. Wait till lighting is fully adopted.

Mine took 2 hours yesterday. Sent 2.5 btc and loaded up XLM and xrp

Sound like Ethereum is the path forward

We will most likely repeat today’s crash of btc tomorrow at 9:00 am PST
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:12:24
Just get both like I did and watch your portfolio grow
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:43:00
Never. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:39:20
Blood in the streets yet??
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:26:43
TLDR bye!
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:59:44
Why ask if there is a Wikipedia.  Everyone answered wrong on here too.

Gdax is free. I transferred 1 btc at no cost and it took less than 30 min to show up.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:19:17
Probably drop and come back up.  Roller coaster for sure. Enjoy the ride. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:16:25
It should be a lambo

First movers means nothing in tech.  Look at AOL for example; first to bring people to the internet but where are they now?

Let’s do it!  I’m in ca and can arrange 50 people at least. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:16:33
Bought some as well at 13.5
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:12:51
I know the feeling. I dumped all my eth at at 430 and bought btc at 16k. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 08:07:57
Do a smaller amount. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:21:03
It has.  Still pending on coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:33:32
It’s normal.
“When using bank transfers, the ACH bank transfer system is used for payments with your bank account. The ACH bank transfer system typically takes 3-5 business days* (which may be as many as 7-10 calendar days, depending on the timing of weekends and other bank holidays) to complete after initiating a purchase”

Go to 14:10
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:59:48
Just put in an order for 5! 
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:35:25
I’ll do an unboxing if and when I get it
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:50:02
He’s dead
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:29:43
I’m waiting 7 days now
