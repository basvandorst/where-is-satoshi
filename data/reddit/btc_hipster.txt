That's one of the main problems. Why would anyone spend their bitcoins if they can be worth 2x in $ tomorrow?
The majority of bitcoin spending is in the black market. And even those people are probably waiting for tomorrow so they can buy more drugs/weapons.

It's a bubble for sure. When it bursts is anyone's guess. If you lose money, you gained an important life lesson.
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:02:29
Or maybe it's because most people are in it to get out (or to buy guns/drugs). Wonder what happens when everybody times their exit around the same time?

I'd like to believe that people are valuing it on potential rather than making a quick buck, but I feel it's the latter influencing the former. You seem to share this pathological way of thinking, trying to rationalize your stake by convincing yourself it's all very revolutionary. But you know what else you can use to buy something instantaneously, from anywhere around the world? A credit card. Yes there are disadvantages to it, but neither is bitcoin a perfect solution. The significant difference is credit cards are established, while bitcoin needs to prove utility and competitive advantage. The only reason bitcoin got so popular in the first place is because it is the de-facto currency in the online black market. Unfortunately, that really isn't all that important to your average law-abiding Joe. Can you name me anything legitimate at all where bitcoins are favored over fiat currency?
I hope in the long-term you will be proven right and bitcoin will change things. But in the day-to-day all I see is overpriced bullshit, much like gold, that nobody really uses or understands.

Well let me tell you a little something, I've been in the bitcoin game before you people ever heard about it. And in that period I have yet to see a legitimate practical use of bitcoin that is a serious competitor to credit cards. So please feel free to enlighten me on what basis is it worth $600 a pop besides pure speculation. A year ago it was worth approx $10-$15. Are people now smoking 40x-60x the amount of drugs? Reading some of the comments here one might think so!

Such hostility. Did I shake your little house of cards?
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:13:39
Your want to buy something will clash with "I can buy 10 somethings later!". From a macro point of view this leads to hoarding and overall bad liquidity. If the general view is to use bitcoin as a savings account, a lot of people are going to get burnt.
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:28:54
Except you address nothing of its practicality. Unless the cost and technical challenges of acquiring bitcoins is significantly less than reaching for my credit card, it will struggle to find a niche, that is, besides its *raison d'être* - the black market).
@_date: 2013-12-07 00:27:29
Not 100% true. Bitcoin is king in the online black market. People will still want it because people will stall want to buy their crack online. It creates an efficient market in that manner, and thus generates value.
However, that is its only practical use at the moment. Most other bitcoin transfers are either kitschy bullshit (e.g. buying a sandwich) or non-value-generating currency trading.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:37:17
Because USD is more fungible and less volatile and I can buy almost anything with a credit card (besides drugs in the mail). Also, you sidestepped the question. Why spend .29 BTC, worth $168 for $200 retail (a good deal), when .29 BTC can be $334 tomorrow (not so good a deal)?
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:39:09
... That's the exact opposite of why to use something.
Why spend $100 in bitcoin when it could be worth $1000 "soon"? There is huge incentive to hoard right now.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:27:30
Because it's valued on hype and little else.
The main gripe I have is how many blindly put their faith and money into bitcoin without asking some very fundamental questions. A part of me understands because they most likely have skin in the game and want to make money and want to be right. But let's be realistic here and not treat this anything more than a souped up blackjack game where everybody is planning the right time to make their exit.

I think mostly good, but not for obvious reasons:
1. Psychology plays a huge role in investment. The valuation of bitcoin in the hundreds of dollars will motivate people to seek less saturated markets, for example litecoin/peercoin, where a dollar appears to go a lot further.
2. The mainstream "success" is causing such extreme volatility that the online black market - bitcoin's main application - may start trading in alternative cryptocurrencies that are less volatile by comparison. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 23:17:42
$5k, maybe. $50k? I highly doubt it. Ask yourself a very simple question: in what scenarios is it more practical to use bitcoin over credit card? The only answer thus far is buying drugs in the mail.
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:54:30
True, but you missed the point completely. If bitcoin, or any commodity really, is to go up 50x in value in a single year, then there should be a visible impact it's making somehow, somewhere. If there isn't, it's a clear sign that the price is speculative.
@_date: 2013-11-20 21:57:14
Bitcoin has value in that it is the currency of choice in the online black market. So technically it does have investment value, but until prices fall to pre-hype levels (I'd say $15-20 per bitcoin today accounting inflation/natural growth), money thrown into bitcoin might as well be put on the roulette table.  
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:19:28
Way more to fall. Ask yourself if there is a rational basis for bitcoin to go up 50 times in value in a single year. The price may very well go up in the short-term on hype alone, but unless it finds a use (besides buying drugs), the price will eventually drop.
@_date: 2013-11-20 00:38:49
Uh... because the sandwich today is a sure thing and the sandwich and a half tomorrow is a gamble? If you have money to throw away, take the risk, if not DON'T! And don't think bitcoin is foolproof and you can make consistent 50% returns coz it ain't and you can't! (if you can PLEASE get in touch with me)
@_date: 2013-11-20 04:40:23
Bitcoin ATMs and exchanges are akin to Forex and are a zero-sum game. Your other examples are good in that they make markets more efficient and contribute to the value of bitcoin; however not a 50 fold increase in value kind of good.
I love bitcoin. I think it's great. But the speculative nonsense plaguing it will harm its reputation more than any government can hope to do (I'm guessing that's why they're so hands off). It brings forward a pathetic greediness in people, where no rationalization is too far fetched. Worst of all, it will eventually eat away their fortunes. But as they said in Rome: *caveat emptor*. The next best thing we can do is not throw more fuel in the fire.
