This sounds way too ambitious for my taste. It seems like you guys are reinventing Project MeshNet where nodes simply get paid with Bitcoin. Who will pay these nodes? The users? Why would they pay for this if simply surfing the internet is already free?
If I were you, I would start out with the cloud storage idea, where anyone can get paid to host encrypted data from unknown peers. If you guys could create this part within a reasonable timespan, I would be extremely impressed. There will be a lot of problems you'll be facing with this system alone. For example, most cloud companies offer free storage up to a few gigabytes, so would it be possible to offer the same, and who will pay for this? Also, how will you make sure users can access their data at all times? I figure the data will need to be stored on more than one computer in the cloud, and even then it would be possible that users wouldn't be able to access their data at any given time. Maybe you could work with a system where nodes with a high uptime get paid more than users that occasionally sync data.
You also haven't exactly told anything about yourself. Who are you? Are you a developer with experience or are you just some guy with an idea? What are some projects you have worked on in the past?

I'm still upset that I lost half my bitcoin investment (0.5 BTC) due to crappy day trading. I could have had double the money I have now. I can't even begin to fantom what it must be like to lose 24k in a day.
