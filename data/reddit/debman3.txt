I just want to add to your correction that completely dismiss parent's comment: hashing additionally happening in client side is not completely useless. If anything is corrupted (the SSL connection, or the connection is there is no SSL, or the hashing server-side...) then the decrypted passwords will be a hash of the real password.
Depending on good the hash was on the client server that allows the client to still have a secure password and not worrying about changing it on different websites eventhough the server was leaked and passwords were cracked.
Also it adds a dimension of trust.

you can't control what your customers do


That's not the point I made


I think you misunderstood what I said, it doesn't add security, it just adds a layer of trust since the server will always have a hash of your password and never deal directly with your password.
I did say that if the passwords tables were leaked they would be hash of hashes thus you wouldn't have to worry about changing your password. This was wrong, thinking about it, if the hashing is well done server-side there is no worry to have, and double hashing doesn't always mean more protection.


He said something along those lines later on in the comments that's why I hijacked this one to say this. Thought it was nice to add to the discussion.

So... There are four different things, green bar going up, green bar going down etc... 
If I understand you correctly a green bar going down represents a tendency that buyers at that price wants to buy at a lower price, and seller at that price want to sell at a higher price.
And a red bar going up means seller are tending to go sell at a lower price and buyer tend to go buy at a higher price.
I'm confused now.
@_date: 2013-03-24 23:00:33
Also everyone's truth is overlapping with everyone's truth. And it's working. So technically everyone's right. And the contrary of being right is wrong. Thus everyone is wrong. We're in a discrete topology where everything is right AND wrong.

SWIM has tried a lot of things, in a lot of countries (north america, china, france, spain) and SWIM can tell you it's not that easy to find good stuff. Since SWIM has discovered SilkRoad SWIM has tried quality like SWIM has never tried before. Like 100 times better SWIM would jokingly say.
Also, prohibition works really well for guns in Europe, compare gun crimes, cops shot etc... (in proportion) between the US and France for example. And in my opinion it works well for drugs as well (except when you have a border with Mexico ;)). 
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:06:24
Except that in many countries guns are forbidden (unless we're only talking about the US here).

@_date: 2013-04-12 02:51:36
I really thought it would. But the logic thing was for btc-e and other exchanges to rise to meet mtgox when mtgox was dropping from the last seen price. It met at 80$. And then, I have no idea why, it started rising on Mtgox.
I really don't understand what's happening here. So people are starting to buy, I have no idea how long it's goint to increase for.

You still tipped him, so good for you, don't listen to others. A tip's a tip.

it just jumped to 115 right after I bought back. I was too scared that it was one of those no-return increasing. We never know but my heart wasn't made for trading, better hold it for me :p
@_date: 2013-04-10 07:02:56
The more I read about bubbles the more I fear for my vacations this summer (that those bitcoins are suppose to pay). If I cash out now I'll be the dumbass that cashed out before it reached x$...
Also. Bitcoin is so usefull, it simplifies online transaction so much that I want it to work. I don't even see a burst or a correction right now (the people are just starting to talk about it. I think we still have a few weeks before something bad happens).
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:11:16
It happens. Rarely though, and the police doesn't have to respond violently with guns most of the time (so they're chiller).
I really want to emphasize that. It happens, RARELY. Everybody will talk about it if there is gunshots. For weeks, or months. In America it's common occurrence to hear gunshots in some cities. I've listened to "This American's Life" last ep and it's just crazy how kids are all fighting with guns in some ghettos.
I'm not being all "FUCK USA. EUROPE IS BETTER". I love the USA. I could see myself live in California, study in Stanford etc... But the reality is here, you guys have a huge gun control problem (if that's the discussion), along with a bad health care, religious freaks, a frightening economy, a government full of hidden lobbyist and a stupid police. I'm sure you can find shitty shortcomings for Europe as well. We suck at english? nor Netflix... This sucks ass btw.
I have no idea what smug means.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:20:26
I predict a drop until the lag stops. Then it will be the moment to buy.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:11:09
why? I don't want to get fees. But they could limit their API or the number of trades per second, minute etc... Trading multiple times under a minute is called "gaming". And the currency doesn't need that.
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:56:29
Why are you so agressive? This subreddit is so circlejerky we can't have a nice discussion without it backfiring.
Silk Road is pretty new and not casual-friendly at all. You have to really want it to go there. SWIM has bought there before for him and his friends, and his friends don't go on SR because it's "too complicated". It's a bit shady as well for newcomers.


Also a law never fully works. At what point do you consider a law working? I consider the drugs law in Europe are working when it's difficult to get a drug. Kids can't get weed like that, and fortunately it's even more difficult for real drugs (yes I believe weed should be legalized btw). Although if you REALLY want to get drugs, you will find drugs (like anywhere in the world). It's like finding alcohol in a very Islamic country, it's ALWAYS possible.
I'm still talking about Europe. Because I know that the drug war in Mexico and its border with the US is not working wonders right now.

@_date: 2013-03-24 19:42:59
or don't listen to advice from people playing with bitcoins. They will trick you into buying and holding.
@_date: 2013-04-07 18:21:32


The thing is. It's not that "complicated". It's just that it seems overly complicated the first time you dig into it.
Even when I read your 5 steps, SWIM would have to explain it to me because I don't understand Tor or SR or bitcoin or... I'm sure most of my friends never even made a bank transfer. SWIM also told me he likes to use SWIM as well because yolo. I have no idea what he means by that. He's kinda stupid.
Anyway, if you think about it, without a tutorial, the guy has to find SR's address. Download TOR. Use Tor to go to SR and create an account with 3 different passwords. He then have to browse (keep in mind that my friends don't necessarily speak good english, especially technical terms). Then you have to understand that you need bitcoins. How do you get bitcoins? You go where everybody advise you to go, you go on Mtgox. Mtgox. Well, there you need verification. You have to find some important papers, scan them, send them (so you have to trust this Mtgox thing). Then you have to wire them some money. Then you have to buy bitcoins, but oh wait, you don't buy them, you make a bid... etc... I mean, I don't really know, SWIM told me that.
@_date: 2013-04-07 12:31:25
I'm more comfortable knowing that I'm holding my money with a company that has been hacked before. It means they know take security pretty seriously.

@_date: 2013-04-26 08:08:55
I went from 11 bitcoins to 3 bitcoins.
* I bought at 30$ I think.
* Told my friends to sell at 260$ but they told me it was a stupid idea. I panicked but didn't sell.
* Then the lag. I tried to sell, didn't work.
* Mtgox shut down. I move my bitcoins to btc-e and sell them at 60$ before Mtgox comes back up thinking it would drive the price even lower.
* Nope, prices increase to 120 bitcoins, then goes back down to 80
* I rage
* I buy back at 166$ 24 hours ago
* 124$ now.
I made all the worst decisions I could have made.
tl;dr : I predicted the peaks somewhere in my mind and did exactly the opposite of what I should have done.

@_date: 2013-04-07 22:04:15
can you elaborate the first point
@_date: 2013-04-07 13:24:54
Here's how I would do it. If average price is 155$ I would place offers for 155.10$, more offers for 155.20$, and even more for 155.30$, etc...
BUT, if you're mtgox. There is an evil and easy way to do this. Higher the market price. So when someone doesn't care about the price when buying, he will buy at a higher price thus increasing the average price.
@_date: 2013-03-29 01:00:13
Maybe it's to avoid daytraders? It's actually a pretty bad thing for a currency to have daytraders.
