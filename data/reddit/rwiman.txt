Wow I respect your transparency and good heart! Keep it up!
I have a brother with Down’s syndrome, if you find it in your heart to contribute to a charity that helps/educates/or otherwise facilitate people with this handicap, I’m forever thankful!
People with DS may not be great thinkers, world leaders or rockstar entrepreneurs, but they are among the most selfless and genuinely caring humans who walk this planet.
If anything, there is a small Parasport organization in Sweden in my hometown who does great things for people with a handicap or disability. They’re all volunteers and their purpose is to create a social and meaningful sport community for people with different disabilities.

Influential? If we count all capital stocks of banks, investment banks and venture banks they run the show on this planet.

Also, Amazon has taken hold of ONLINE retail. The online retail sales account for about 12% of total retail sales in the US (2016).
While Amazon has around 45% of that there’s no denying that they bring in some disruptions and innovation to the market. 
Considering how large Amazon are, and the statistics, I think bitcoin is far from disrupting banks - unpopular opinion perhaps.
Like, we may send fewer mails than before email, but we still send shit through post (I know amazon does...). So in conclusion, things change and adopt.
Banks are affected, but not disrupted.
