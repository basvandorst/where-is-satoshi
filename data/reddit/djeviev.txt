I wanted to pass through Brazil a little, but had no plans to be there long, and yeah I know with the current political climate to avoid Venezuela and Bolivia, but I will probably take you up on that offer with some questions! You helped settle my concerns, I'm for sure going!

I'm that mix of Irish/German that doesn't really let me tan. I just burn, the burned skin peels off, and I reburn. Plus I was talking more like South America, not just Mexico

Serious question, I want to be able to explore Southern America but I'm... The whitest looking white man you've ever seen. You know the white that is so white that parts of me look pink? Is it safe for me to even travel and explore down there?

I'm not too concerned about Mexico, I'm talking like farther south america

I'm not worried about sticking out to the locals as long as I'm not kidnapped lmao. I know not all of South America is like this, but every country has it's bad areas. I'm pretty confident that I will be making that trip through South America now though.

Idk man, to each his own, but once the fruit is cooked into something, I have a hard time calling that fruit.
"Yeah man, I had a few apples today."
"What kind, granny smith or what?"
"Oh no I meant apple pie"

I want to travel all of South America, it looks so incredibly beautiful but I've heard many many many stories about very very white people being kidnapped down there if you're in the wrong part so I'm just looking for some random internet people to tell me I'm safe so I can start planning a long trip :)
