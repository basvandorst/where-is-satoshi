Make sure you have camera enabled in settings or your camera app won’t open.

Yet another reason to control your own keys. Sorry to hear that. I took my funds off of exchanges a few months ago with fears of this happening.

That brand of ATM claims to be helping people access BTC by effectively charging a huge premium on the spot price and a fee on top of that too. There are better ATM’s.

If you don’t mind sharing , what was the exact amount in BTC? There has been a recent spur in small BTC deposits coming from a mixer.

Coinbase vault offers a 2/3 or 3/5 signature vault for their supported assets for no extra cost. There is a 48 hour waiting period after every “signed” withdrawal request. I use quotations when I mention signature because you are not actually signing the transaction, rather verifying from multiple email addresses that you give Coinbase permission to sign on your behalf. 
I use the vault for certain purposes but it goes against some of the original vision...

Sweep using edge wallet and then send to ledger.

You should slow down and learn the fundamentals about btc and why it is so important and powerful. Start with satoshis white paper.
It is most certainly not for only criminals. That’s like saying knives are only used for stabbing people. 
What atm company?

Borker.io - essentially decentralized Twitter with everything posting to the dogecoin blockchain. 
This is a great idea, but requires more development to be able to support video, etc. 
One day....

Yes it’s better for security to use a new address with each use that way the person sending you funds is unable to see your balance, or potentially even identify where the funds came from , which could result in them identifying you.
That being said, the risk is pretty small.

You can always use those addresses, as they are derived from your private keys stored/encrypted on the ledger nano S.

It could go down to 4K overnight, but it’s reasonably unlikely. I don’t know the last time BTC took a 50% drop in 8 hours. At the same time, if you’re worried about going under your original investment,
1. Take some profits (and regret it when btc hits 20k)
2. Set a stop loss
3. Buy more if BTC drops under your original purchase price.

When I bought my first bitcoin it was at a bitcoin atm. BTC was trading around $500 on coinbase and the atm was charging around $580. I went home, I didn’t buy. I bought on coinbase and noticed it would be 5-7 days before I got the coins.
I went back the next day with twice as much cash, and back again the next day, and back the next day. Buying the daily max without ID required. 
Ultimately the BTC atm is a convenience fee.

Hearing him say the halving causes the supply to be cut in half made me cringe. Someone link this guy to a white paper or something.
Issuance is cut in half, ya dunce.

Lol, I like Robinhood and all, but you don’t own bitcoin on Robinhood. You are just trading the price of BtC on Robinhood. That being said, you should be able to set a price alert and just act on it if you choose.
Make a coinbase, cash app, btc atm, or find somewhere that enables you purchase and transfer to your own custodial wallet to understand the sovereignty of bitcoin. As always, learn how to manage keys before transferring it to yourself.

Does Chainalysis create dusting attacks for tracking purposes?
Where does Chainalysis get their bad actor databases?
How does Chainalysis deal with risk ratings in wallets that have funds that have been through a mixer?

I’m not sure what you’re asking to do here. Bitcoin is a digital currency and PayPal is a financial services provider. 
Are you trying to buy or sell btc using PayPal?

Coinbase is not a bad option for smaller amounts of coins. Their hot wallets are insured and you can opt in to use their vault with something like a multi sig (through email approval).
Coinbase is a private company, thus a centralized exchange that is holding the keys on your behalf.
The beginning of the journey of understanding crypto is understanding the storage of your own keys. You can use wallet apps like edge wallet or brd wallet to securely and independently store your keys on the mobile device, just remember to store the backup securely, as anyone with access to the backup can access and move the funds. 
Another option is a hardware wallet like Ledger or Trezor, but they are substantially more expensive (compared to a free mobile wallet). If you’re going to buy a hardware wallet do it brand new from the company. 
Edit: typo

One of the only companies I know that has 100% insurance on their customers cold storage is SALT. 
SALT allows you to borrow against crypto but their custody is top notch. The policy is through Allianz and Lloyd’s of London syndicates and literally covers 100% of customers crypto assets held on their platform.
