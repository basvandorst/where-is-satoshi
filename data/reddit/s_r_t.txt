I like the direction that "fortified" and "fast" are pointing too. However, I think the only thing that is missing is also a sense of being accessible, easy to move, and cheap to transact. Maybe something along the lines of "Bitcoin = fortified, fast, and friendly digital currency"

A PhD in Psychology may be more relevant in the Bitcoin economy than a PhD in Mathematics or Economics. Wait... I'm a fourth year PhD student in Industrial-Organizational Psychology (and have taken advanced 700 level statistics classes and published my fair share of statistical analyses) and I am losing money like everyone else right now. Damn it! No one can really predict the timing of the twist and turns we will take towards greater adoption. Hence, bitcoin is speculative and a risky world these days. The only truth is that greater adoption will bring more stability to the market price and the use case for adoption of Bitcoin is pretty damn good... Therefore, we are in a marathon and not a sprint. Wait for the VC money to have time to produce some more companies that increase ease of use later this year.

MrMadden, you raise a good question. 
Do we:
A) Invest into Smart Wallets that keep track for us and issue the appropriate tax forms to us when needed
B) Take a page out of the r/dogecoin book and crowd source a good amounts of coin and form a legit political force to lobby the powers
C) Sit back and hope the Bitpay and the Foundation have enough horsepower, stamina, and pull in Washington to get the job done
D) We all move to Denmark
what does r/bitcoin think?

Your attack on Andreas is a bit absurd my fellow redditer. Andreas is not a flip-flopping politician or a talking head libertarian idealist. He's a computer security programer with a little more intelligence, compassion, and vision than most of the others. That's it. For someone to "control" Bitcoin they would need to perform a 51% attack and that is not going to happen, he was right. Most Bitcoin people do want to pay taxes, this is also true. Lastly, Bitcoin is a global asset tracking tool but no bank or government can freeze or steal coins that are being handled by an informed and computer literate steward of digital wealth.

WE are in a marathon and not a sprint. Be smart, be patient, and carry some coins at all times. The 3rd and 4th quarter of this year are our defining times. To the moon.

Hello Danis, thanks for putting this inquiry out to Just be honest and truthful about the innovation, its potential, and the VC $ moving into the Bitcoin space. Bitcoin is a tremendous story that has been misrepresented over and over again by the media. I ask for what is real beyond highlighting the small % of nefarious users, Satoshi headline grabbers, and anti-government talking heads. Part of the truth is that Bitcoin is a risky investment. However, I do believe wholeheartedly that it is an investment that is worthy of 1% of every single one of your audience members portfolios.

Just want to say thanks for your efforts. Apps like this are great ways to introduce people to Bitcoin. Thank you!!

Your probably right. I am pretty sure Ethereum is setting up shop in Switzerland already. However, the US exchanges with big name backers currently getting funded through VC $ and expected to be live later this year will thrive in the US...

Buying coin now may be the biggest steal of 2014 as the VC $ starts to produce live and active companies in the later part of the year and increase ease of adoption.

Let us be clear, focused, smart, and honest with ourselves, we are in a marathon and not a sprint at the current time. Although Bitcoin had a tremendous return late last year and has the potential for exponential adoption, we are young, honing our skills (apps and software) doing push-ups after hours (Core dev development and transaction capacity) in the empty gym. Our primetime debut will be in the 3rd and 4th quarter of this year.
