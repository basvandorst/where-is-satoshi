There are thousands of coins and most are not even commodities...

OK, I don't think you can read.
"Roughly 1 in 20 actively managed domestic funds beat index funds"
What you originally said is not the point, you replied to ME on MY post about people who would be trading bitcoin, which S&amp;P index funds wouldn't do. If you're just saying something completely unrelated, why reply to me?
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:47:57
Damn :(
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:29:08
No I didn't, I already said ages ago that I didn't do the math and just threw out a random number, since the exact amount has nothing to do with the general idea.
Also those are average returns for index funds not actively managed funds, which is what I was trying to help educate you about.

Real market share, is not. Market cap is an illusion. 24hr volume as a % of market cap is 1% for ripple, 40% for btc. Everyone will freak out about it, and it might overtake Bitcoin, it's possible, but it's a classic case of make a million products, sell one at $10 and claim to have $10million.

I didn't do any math, I just put a random high number there. Since it wasn't relevant to my point.

It wasn't sent through a wallet, it was sent on changelly.com

Their SMM is married to a Bcash investment fund manager, which is a joke of a job lmao....

You think they might not have been referring to crypto, 20 years before it's invention? Yeah, might be a safe bet.

I doubt he's upset, btc is still up from a month ago dude. Everyone in this thread feeling good they didn't invest would have been up 300% from a few months ago, aka 25 years of stock investing, but people like to tell themselves they made the right decision. 
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:07:07
Huh? If they were trying to ban the stock market mentioning that many government members have stocks wouldn't be seen as corruption, you're just biased.

Roughly 1 in 20 actively managed domestic funds beat index funds, we're talking about active investors who would be betting on futures, so your hypothetical is the top 5% of investors and NOT THE AVERAGE.

It loses them money. Transaction fee =s people keep their bitcoin on your platform instead of taking it out and putting it back in = more funds on your platform = more in-exchange profits.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:57:09
That's a small %, though. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 01:59:19
OK, but will I get the amount of BTC from the time I sent the altcoin, or the new price? Basically are they making money even if they do eventually send it?
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:28:53
I do understand risk, I don't think you understood what I said. It was negative on the stock market, no crypto.

Are you a billionaire? If you could predict that easily you would be one, of you're not fuck off.
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:06:52
Correct, it's an indication of how much is being sold/moved in 24hrs. The less sold/moved the easier it is to influence price. If 10 bananas are being sold, vs 1000 strawberry's being sold, that impacts your real world stock value if you're holding 100k bananas and 100k strawberrys. Your 100k strawberry's are worth more, because if you flood the market with your strawberrys the price will remain higher due to higher demand. Whereas if you put 100k banana's on the market and only 10 are sold each day, your stock is worth much less. If the going price for banana's is $1 at 10 per day, your stock is probably worth 5c per banana unless you drip feed it 10 per day for years.

They don't even do batching, let alone segwit.

The people withdrawing on GDAX vs Coinbase... If it made them more money they would of switched overnight.
@_date: 2018-01-18 01:54:56
Nope, you are, I understand it's hard to admit you're wrong but let's not play this game. Stock Market Index funds don't invest in bitcoin, we're talking about active investors.

"Our" did she pay half? 
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:59:08
Which have nothing to do with it's value.
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:27:00
You don't need a source to deny a claim, the burden of proof is on the one making the claim. Why don't you ask for proof that holds industrial value is any significant component of the price?

Most gold is held by central banks, if only 15% of gold transacted per year is for non bullion or jewelry purposes and only 1% of total gold supply is transacted per year were looking at 0.15% of what makes up the price. Gold is about perceived value. 
It's physical properties much like bitcoins properties make it great for use as a currency.
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:25:40
Yes, absolutely nothing. Less than 1%
