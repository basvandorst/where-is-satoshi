Hey there, I'm the CEO of Sift Science. To - we will never share a user's personal information with requesters. When we receive a request for personal information, we work closely with our customers (e.g. Coinbase) to validate the user's identity. After we verify that the email account hasn't been spoofed, we respond to the request with the **categories** of personal information our customers have shared with us to prevent fraud (if any). 
We ourselves are citizens of the internet, and want to act in a way that we would want to be treated. We will never sell your data to advertisers. That would go completely against why we founded this company. It sounds cheesy, but we want to make the internet a better place. Preventing criminal activity helps businesses thrive.

Hi there,
Jason here, CEO/co-founder of Sift Science. Longtime lurker (especially on It's a bit meta to see a post about our company.
1) Apologies for the "privacy typo -- we've fixed it.
2) I'd echo the comment from . Most online businesses lack the know-how and tools to effectively curb fraud. Our mission is to make it easy and accessible for these businesses to defend themselves. Otherwise, they often can't survive the fraud onslaught. The data collection is to fight fraud, not invade privacy. It's a bit of a Catch-22, but...
3) We too are citizens of the internet, and strive to treat others the way we'd want to be treated. We recently brought on an experienced Trust &amp; Safety advisor. We hold ourselves to a high standard of security and data ethics, and continue to improve those standards. We won't abuse the trust our customers place in us.
4) We do not use "super cookies". Other vendors might, but not us.
