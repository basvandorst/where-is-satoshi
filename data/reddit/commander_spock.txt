That is literally what George Washington and Alexander Hamilton wanted to avoid by starting a new Constitution. Fresh off their victory at Yorktown, Washington found that he was unable to pay his soldiers their promised salaries, a common and reoccurring problem. Under the Articles of Confederation, the federal government had no power to tax its citizens. Instead, under the Articles, the federal government had to beg the separate states for money to fund its army. After the Revolutionary War was over, the several states were intimidated by the now veterans to pay their bills. At one point, the federal congress had to move from Philadelphia under duress to avoid an army of war veterans seeking just compensation. One of the reasons a constitutional convention was called in 1787 by Washington and Hamilton was to strengthen the federal government and give it the power to tax.

As a lawyer,  I can definitively say there is nothing true in this post.  Not one sentence.

This is not quite correct. The transactions are not "grabbed" after a correct number is found. The transactions are part of the math problem that gets the correct number. Miners use the transactions in the mempool, usually highest fees first, add a nonce and hash it in hopes of getting a hash with beginning with a definite number of zeros. Once this number is found, it is broadcast to other miners for confirmation.

These loans are about liquidity not about increasing money supplies.  These are extremely short term loans to ensure market participants have enough cash to move money around. So the headline suggesting that the Fed is devaluing money is not correct.  However, these short term loans do show stress in the financial markets, which could suggest future problems.
