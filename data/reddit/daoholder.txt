Have you even read the terms of bfx use?

What exactly do you mean by "It", and which exactly law "it" is?

awesome! when you think it cannot get worse, Bitfinex sets a new standard for retardness, ready to be put under glass cover.

It's human factor risks, not the technology. You take that risk when giving money to exchange in any form.
Also, you take additional technology risks when you give money in the form of BTC, as USD transactions are reversable, BTC - not.
Therefore, total risks for cryptos are higher, than fiat's, and the hack is a good example of this fact.
On the other hand, as soon as user accepts bfx's terms of use, there are no grounds whatsoever to cover losses using other users money.
Of course, I'm aware that users don't really care about what they've accepted.

then it's really strange, that USD is still on their bank accounts, and BTC is somewhere else, isn't it?

btw, I'll return it to bfx (well, at least 95% - to reward myself for being a good person).

In that case - yes.
But if you had USD on your account to margin trade against BTC, and had no open position atm of the hack, nor gave your USD to loans - where are your losses? Losses can only come from the other customers intending to cover their losses (accepted atm of accepting the terms) with your funds.
I agree though, that this kind of logic won't be relevant in US or any other court.

before you do that, dedicate some 5 minutes to read the terms of use you've accepted.
@_date: 2016-08-04 18:05:42
no, it is not.
some depositors deposited USD, knowing that this asset is less risky than cryptos are. 
the others deposited BTC, taking higher risks coming from BTC transaction irreversability.
Name one good reason, why USD depositors should take BTC depositor risks, especially taking into the account BFX's terms of use?

well, you were right after all.
they've chosen the short-term cheapest solution, the path of least resistance.
in long-term, I believe, it creates more problem than it solves.
