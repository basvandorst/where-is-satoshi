ATMs maybe.

Are you behind 7 proxies though?
You'll only mock as long as you think you're protected.

Wish I wasn't fiat broke during this latest crypto dip.

If it all went to zero, it would still have been worth the entertainment value alone.  I'm loving this.

I believe what ever you had in Bitcoin on the exchange at the time of the fork.

Sold my bch, bought cuphead. It was a good day!

Vote with your wallet.

It was never announced, it just happened.

Easiest way to get started is to make an account on Coinbase.  Yes, you can buy as much or as little as you like.

I expect an official United States crypto within the next ten years. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 08:12:25
Nope.  Only sold of my small bit of bcash.

You tease, I need pics.

The US will release their own eventually that they can fully monitor and control.

I've seen advice that recommends you change paper wallets after every transaction.  What's the purpose of this?  Is there any kind of maintenance one should be aware of when using a hardware wallet?

I'm just an idiot, buying a crowbar is a lot easier.
@_date: 2018-10-14 03:17:48
Wow, are all bitcoin atms this way?
@_date: 2018-06-21 20:20:48
Nice, I love it!  Can't wait to dive in.
@_date: 2018-06-21 08:22:45
Links?  I'd love to read these.

If everyone is in it to hold and not spend, what will that do to the viability of BTC and other cryptos in the future?
Apples to oranges here, but remember when dollar coins were supposed to replace paper?  Everybody instead kept everyone they ever came across, including buying out banks whenever they had the chance.  Vending machine started changing to accept dollar coins, but it never took off because no one was spending them.

That's exactly what I thought at 3k, then 4k, then 5k, then 6k, then 7k.  Now I'm in.  I'm not expecting big things, but it's cool to be a part of it anyway. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:09:30
That's what will happen as BTC becomes more popular.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:54:53
I was trying to set an alert for when it hit 10k so I wouldn't miss it and I couldn't figure out why it wasn't working.  That's right when it was at 10,000.00...

That's been my concern as well, even though I'm small time.  I'm still not entirely sure how to create a key that I know is absolutely not able to be copied or stolen.  Anything on a computer seems like it could be easily duplicated and stolen.  Still getting my head wrapped around btc security.  I've been leaving my small balance with coinbase until I can get it properly figured out.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:13:12
Yeah well I've got about 60 bucks worth right now, I'm expecting to be a billionaire soon. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:28:47
There it is!! 10,000 even!  
They say the sky is the limit, but there are footprints on the moon.

It could all go to zero and it still would have been worth the ride.
