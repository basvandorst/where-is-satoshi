No. I’m saying it might be a good idea to not to make a huge investment without fully understanding what you are buying. Once you own bitcoin, even if it is a fractional amount, you will start to see it differently. 
Not trying to deter you from jumping down the “rabbit hole”, just urging you do so with your eyes wide open ;)
Edit: as others have suggested, dollar cost averaging is a good approach when first entering the (brave new) crypto world. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:23:33
You should probably move your coins to a wallet where you hold the private keys and explain how that works to your significant other.
Holding funds on an exchange for any substantial period of time is just tempting fate. Bitcoin can’t be hacked, but exchanges get hacked all the time ;)

This, the invovation, in regards to currency, is two fold: cryptography and decentralization, both allow bitcoin to exist outside of the control of nation states and guarantee security on many levels. It is true that the burden of securing the capital itself is transferred from the state to the individual, but in places like Brazil (where I live) the state has a history of liquidating pension plans, there is widespread corruption and we have a history of high inflation so I trust myself far more than I trust the private and public banks.

Fees are based on tx size. Different from banks, which is usually a percentage of the amount being transferred.

1. Nations all over the world have been privatizing or subcontracting formerly state-run industries, like building highways and other city-works projects, at an increasing rate. And these private companies are making lots of profit. Personally, I don't think development via austerity is the best prescription, but to each his own and that is the direction things seem to be going as of late.

Remember, not all nation states are equal. 
Crypto could be useful for a state that is being restricted by a powerful global community (NATO, UN). For example, to get around sanctions (North Korea, Iran) or to subvert occupation (Palestine). It might also be useful as a reserve currency for countries suffering from hyper inflation (Venezuela). 
Hell, China might even manage to take advantage of Bitcoin to propel the Chinese Yuan (CNY) to the top of mountain bumping off the US Dollar as the primary global reserve currency. 
It certainly is easier to move btc around the world compared to something like gold or petro.

Bitcoins are stored on the public block chain. Wallets give you access to the blockchain and provide some level of encryption. Hardware wallets have an extra level of security because  you need to physically have the hardware to sign transactions.

I'm looking forward to seeing how side chains can be used to increase fungibility.

If you're in Manhattan  or Brooklyn there are a bunch of ATMs.

You can try writing the wallet service directly, but that is a long shot. If you don't have your private key or the 12-24 word phrase (which can be used to generate your private key) there is no way to recover your funds. Sorry about your loss, expensive lesson I guess...
Edit: in the future don't take a screen shot of your private key (phones/cloud backups are easier to hack than we realize), write it down the old-fashion-way using a pen and paper and store it somewhere safe.

Meet in person and buy w/cash.

Older address work just fine. Makes you more vulnerable to being doxed, but does not affect transaction. Probably just stuck in the mempool. What's the tx id ?

Yeah, because modern "democratic republics" have been so successful thwarting  monarchies around the world... cough...cough...cough. ��
Taking advise  from a blue blooded aristocrat about 21st century global finance and politics is like asking a 16th century Spanish conquistador if he would prefer his bounty paid in paper stock options rather than precious metals and royal encomienda land grants.

The real question is: will the world be made up of nations of citizens or will the 21st century usher in a new age of collective social organization, perhaps one characterized by a new iteration of corporate clientelism? Who knows,  in ten years the most sought after IDs might just be an interface with Apple's or Google's client info database. But to answer your question, yeah, you would have to renounce your citizenship to avoid paying US taxes.

I guess in the end, all roads really do lead back to Roam.... 
Monopolies on "legitimate" violence can't last forever ;)

There is nothing illegal about exchanging that amount of cash in public. That's what envelopes are for;) .It gets more complicated (tax-wise) when dealing with sums in excess of 10k USD.
