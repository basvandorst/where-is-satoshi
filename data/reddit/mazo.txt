The other main thing is you can be reasonably certain that the site you're connecting to is actually the site you want. Otherwise a man-in-the-middle attack would allow them to plant malware/tracking etc on a near-identical looking site.

You have to pull the database file off your phone. However you do that is up to you (Google it.)
Once you have it you can use a sqlite database browser to view the data and import by hand, or use [this handy tool]( to automatically generate QR codes
One thing I've noticed is it doesn't like hash ( characters in the description field when importing, so remove those first. *cough*mtgox*cough*

Technically yes. Changing the COIN constant to have 9 zeroes instead of 8 will pretty much do the trick though. There are no doubt other bits that would need changing too.

They are infinitely divisible in the sense that it would be fairly trivial to increase the precision on the floats giving you more than 8 decimal places.

Well done to you, but there's a far more glaring issue in this post.
localbitcoins willingly gave a complete stranger someone elses **ENTIRE login history including ip address history used when logging in to the site and all their withdrawal adresses**. Holy shit that is scary that a site would do that on request by anybody.

While I somewhat agree, processes like that are far too open to exploitation. You could quite easily collaborate with a few people or make a few dummy accounts to get someone flagged for fraud, then get all the info you want.

The issue is people have been requesting withdrawals then manipulating the transaction hash so the coins will still be sent, but gox's wallet software will not recognize that the coins have actually gone because the txid they use is different to the txid that actually sent the coins.
@_date: 2014-03-19 10:23:24
For FTTC 80/20 is pretty common here now.

Ironically "to the moon" is quite fitting with this picture, when you think about Portal 2.
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:56:05
You're confusing cause and effect. The cause of the issue is transaction malleability. The effect is some transactions have gone out with incorrect txid's causing mtgox's wallet to be out of sync with what their software expects. This causes subsequent withdrawals to fail (or appear failed, they may have gone through with a different txid)

Even with those hints it's going to be near impossible without narrowing down what kind of word list to use. You say 'recent' additions to the oxford english dictionary but how recent is that? If we can say the words have definitely been added in the last 3-5 years then that's more possible.

I don't think they do. CloudFlare can do a half-and-half type approach, where the data between you and cloudflare is encrypted by their SSL key, whereas the data between cloudflare and the web server is encrypted using the server's SSL key.

Not really. If you willingly hand over your identification (gov't ID required by gox etc) and then make transactions linked to that ID then that's your own fault.
