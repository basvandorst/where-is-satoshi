Can you even explain the fundamentals behind a market movement or are you just straight retarded?

Where did you do your post-grad in economics and finance?

You realize a stoic would never gamble right.
@_date: 2018-01-24 01:02:50
ROFL no that's called a gambling high - some people can't handle it. Those who can, can't get enough.

I don't think it's that loosely defined. Vice is quite explicitly stated and so is virtue. 
Intemperate and foolish acts would constitute a vice, which gambling would fall under.  However, I do make a distinction on gambling that it is an act in which only pure chance effects the outcome, not your knowledge or skill, so something like poker would not be considered gambling if you were skillful.
If you are a stoic, how can you say that certain acts you carry out in life have nothing to do with stoicism? It would encompass all acts you make.

This is the thing about libertarians I never really understand; you want a government to enforce exclusive property rights, with all the powers that it would require to do so, but you also don't want them to use it to enforce those rights against yourself.  Such an odd position to hold.

You are completely wrong, makes me wonder if you even are a fund manager.

This right here is fucking stupid
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:50:36
It's the yo-yo'ing of the value they are talking about not the average rise in price. 
God this sub is so fucking moronic.

What if I need more capital than one lender can provide?
What if lenders have differing terms and conditions? 
Is it fair for different borrowers to receive different terms and conditions on their loans compared to another borrower when you keep everything the same? How do you regulate against unfair discrimination?
What about borrowers that use fraudulent identities? Are there going to be any regulations to control international commerce? Anti-money laundering regulations that by their very nature require a centralized authority? How will you create 'consensus' to do that?
Your comment is one of the big reasons why I think people who are buying bitcoin thinking it's going to be some kind of financial cure-all are in for a rude awakening.
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:00:06
Shhhh what are you a degree-holding economist? Next you're gonna tell me theres a difference between investing and speculating.
@_date: 2018-11-26 01:29:43
I suggest you take a basic introductory course on economics.

If you buy all of it, and no one is going to buy them from you, then the value will be 0 regardless of what you think.

Everyone here is just a gambler. When bitcoin is over, they will move on to the next fad to stick their money in. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 09:22:05
HODLERS are actually the lifeblood of this entire scam - er, I mean currency network.
They represent the 99% of BTC who do nothing but buy and hold. 
Whales love them. What better way to launder money than to sell useless BTC for cold hard cash? 
Fantastic really.

I've followed the Crypto space for about the last 5 years.
Nothing in that time has changed the fundamentals of any of the majory cryptos - they are all intrinsically valueless.
The only way to give it value is by fiat - government must declare it to be legal currency or it cannot gain widespread adoption and will remain essentially worthless.
In fact Im pretty sure most of the BTC/Crypto is held by a few major players who use it primarily to launder money for their clients who are evading U.S financial sanctions or some other illegal activity.  This is the only real use for any crypto - otherwise you would just use cash or credit.
To anyone reading this comment. If you own any crypto consider it valueless and try and take profit as soon as you can. Do not end up a sucker.

They deserve to be losing their money though.  Bad investors always lose money.

Where did you study economics? You're making it sound like it's bad to have inflation over deflation.
@_date: 2018-11-26 02:29:25
I'm sure you don't if you honestly think the Gold standard is an adequate tool for governments to rely on for their monetary policy.

You're a child because you think anarchy is a good idea.

Well of course there are all sorts of investors. 
I'm just telling you what a smart investor does. But for someone like you, that doesn't know much about how to invest or what good financial planning looks like, I agree, it's best for you to buy and hold. After all, we need people like you who are willing to buy at almost any price point so that others can sell and realize their gains.  A market like this only works if there are enough sheep to fleece. Once they start drying up, it all crashes.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:05:00
You should exit the market before you lose your savings.
In fact, you should be periodically withdrawing your 'investments' from a highly speculative asset class like bitcoin and realize profits before you don't have the chance to.
It's what a smart investor does. You find the price point you are willing to sell at because it offers you a ROI that is worth the risk, and then you sell at that price point, barring any new developments.
This way, you can buy in at 3k, sell at 6k, buy in at 8k, sell at 15k. 
In this manner, you can take money from all the rubes who are just holding their bitcoin like a sack of potatoes. And then, when the music finally stops, you won't be left with a sack of potatoes.

You are required by law to pay US taxes in U.S. dollars.
They will never allow you to pay in anything other than U.S. dollars. For the same reason you can't pay U.S. taxes in pesos or euros. 
I know this because I went to university and have an education.  
As to your question; You can't sell property in BTC as far as I'm aware. But if you did, I would imagine the IRS would come to collect their share at the market-value of BTC in USD. 
The reason government's wont ask you to pay in btc, is the same reason they don't ask oil refineries to pay in barrels of oil or farmers in bushels of wheat.
Also a deflationary currency like bitcoin just sounds like an economic disaster. No one would lend money, investment would dry up, debtors would end up getting fucked in the ass, you know, people like small-business owners or farmers, or your local plumber who recently took on debt to buy a vehicle. They would all get fucked in the ass by a loan denominated in deflationary currency.

As long as the government of the United States exists, they will require you to pay taxes in U.S. dollars. Therefore, there is almost no scenario in which no one uses USD anymore.

Great marketing, good use of emotional appeal and a narrative that resonates well with white, middle-class men that have no hope in life.

No that's not how it works.
You retain the same percentage of ownership. The only thing that changes is the number of stocks you hold and the price.
