I'm curious about how long the proces took for the lawyer. How long did you have to wait and what evidence did you have to provide? BTW I am glad for you having your btc's back.

It is a very tiny and neat client. Basic, but very stable and to the point. The internal search function works great, it is open source, has zero advertisements and it is actively being developed. A huge benefit is that it uses minimal resources. Apart from the open source-part, it reminds me of the "old" uTorrent (when it was tiny compared to the bloatware you get today).

More than 22 BTC. In one day 25k! I can foresee a new trend coming up.

Thank you for the explanation. This is an eye opener for me.

So if I understand correctly, some sort of bitcoin bank is not allowed at this stage as this is regarded as a financial institution (to prevent money laundering by providing financial instruments like mortgages, ETF's and other exotic financial instruments). An exchange is something different and does not provide these financial instruments in which people can launder their money. 
This is no bad news! This is exactly what I would do to prevent crime and money laundering.
Edit; So is a Chinese company like bitpay allowed by this policy? Will it be seen as financial institution?

Would an equivalent of Bitpay be regarded as a financial institution? It does not provide financial instruments, however it exchanges btc for RMB.
