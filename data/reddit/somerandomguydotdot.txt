There's supposed to be an executive order preventing action by the CIA on state soil, which I think predates some of the legal discussion regarding the rights on non-US citizens under the constitution (thanks to G-bay stuff).
Probably would have to ask like a legion of lawyers to get a legion of technical feasible answers though.

No, they can be aware of it and it's still a 0-day. By the definition of 0-day being anything prior to a patch, and day 1 being the first day a public patch is available. (Which I think is more common of a definition, maybe even including a the first day as day 0 for the computer nerds.)

Ah! I get it!
Except disclosure and patching is a provable condition, and vendor unawareness in much harder to prove. Which, is a very practical distinction, as you said, for people selling the exploits.

I don't think this is true... We'd have to hit up someone with serious theoretical computing chops, but I'm pretty sure that the *theoretical* improvements only do something like reduce the key space from 2^256 to 2^128, which is still heat death of the universe type computation, and I think it's slightly better for RSA in practice because key strength can still be feasibly increased.
This isn't really what the leaks about, which I think is that the number of side channel attacks is so large that it's hard to prove that in your environment cryptographic integrity is even relevant against state actors.
That being said, maybe there's something in the frequency analysis portion of the leaks that I'm just not getting.

I wasn't talking about Shor's. I was talking about Grover's.
Key space increase to RSA increase the number of Qubits required for the computation. Making it impossible for Shor's to be run in the foreseeable future in practice. (Again, we'd need serious chops for someone to verify that increased key size, increases the *minimum* number of qubits)
That being said, RSA is I believe used to key exchanges in the current model, which would have a quantum replacement at that point (Again we'd need someone with serious chops to speculate.)
So replace RSA for the key exchange with a secure key exchange, use AES for the data encryption and you should still have a search space of 2^128 (assuming the current standard of AES256).
But, I think the minimum required number of gates for 128 bit AES are less than that of 2048 Bit RSA, making 128 Bit AES vulnerable, before RSA.
Again, we'd need someone with serious chops to talk about this because, I'm sure as fuck not qualified to discuss theoretical attacks, on theoretical hardware, against theoretical encryption schemes.

The 5th sbox was planned. The changes to des were literally decades ahead, and not a rumor. The rumor is that it was planned to leave a vulnerability, the attack against the cipher itself that the changes guarded against weren't made public for about 15 years.
