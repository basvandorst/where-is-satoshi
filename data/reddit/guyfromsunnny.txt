Price stabilization around $10k for basically 3/4 of Feb was unexpected. I really thought bitcoin would drop back down a bit around $7500 but it never managed to. With the caveat that one expectation didn’t hit, I do anticipate March to be a big month for the big 2 (btc/ltc). We shall see.

This current run is almost certainly a bull trap, but it’s important to point out that the price of bitcoin has risen $4,000 since you told us to keep holding to the bottom. No stock has risen that much, by dollar or by points, in the same period of time.

I love the emojis, the pseudo-intellectual wordiness and your inability to understand the difference between “your” and “you’re.” Don’t worry, I’m here to help, friend.

At this point you’re probably wondering how. You were so sure bitcoin would be below $4000, it being a scheme in your little mind, but it’s bounced more than 25% since your rant. The reasons are many, it has a lot to do with the senate hearing, but more than anything, it’s a continued market correction. Keep watching, it’s going to really be something!

Clearly satire. People are so gullible

Higher lows on more measurable bounces is a sign of strength.

Keeeep trying!

Intellectual high road isn’t a phrase I’m familiar with, but now that I’m in your head, I’ll pop back to explain the next development, whenever that happens.

*Very* good! Attitude is everything!

This retrace has tested resistance hard at about $8700. Hopefully you bought either Bitcoin at $6,000 or Litecoin at $100. If so, hold tight and keep an eye on the news.

This climb back that you’re watching is simply an example of an upward trend. Think of it like this, when you go to work, u/WraithMagik, you get in the car and your dad drives you straight there, pretty simple right? But with an asset, it’s like having your dad drive you to work but he gets you there *eventually*, he drives back and forth a few times, maybe takes the long way. I know you seem pretty impatient, which is why investing is tough for you, but imagine bitcoin’s trip to $30,000 as “taking the long way.” It may bounce between $1,000-$20,000 along the way, but it will get there eventually. I’m sorry I couldn’t create a metaphor using videogames to help you understand it even better, but I’m sure this helped. I’ll come back from time to time with more explanations.

The biggest problem with crypto is that opened up a sleek new way to invest for folks with no investment experience. Basic logic should say this is a good thing, young people don’t invest as much as they should, 1-3 have no retirement or 401k plans by age 25, that’s horrifying. What happened was that crypto became so mainstream so quickly that everyone thought they were going to get rich over night. You bought your $25 worth of bitcoin at $18,000 and the price retraced and now you’re salty, instead taking it as a lesson, you externalize, which doesn’t do anything but hurt you worse than losing your $50. 
Belief that bitcoin goes back to zero ignores very basic market forces, believing it will go $1,000,000 also ignores these market forces. Anyone who has even a little experiences has been pulling profits and averaging down since christmas-ish. I have bitcoin entry points between $900 and $16,500 and exit points scattered all across there as well, with a little stashed aside for a $30,000 exit point. My advice is that you should stick to the sidelines and concentrate on xbox, the volatility isn’t for everyone. 
Edit- it’s important, too, that you understand that it’s not that I disagree with you, you’re just incorrect.

Lol, no, you weren’t serious. 
But yes, it was funny how many people think you’re serious.
