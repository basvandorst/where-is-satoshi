In my experience gold is far easier to buy and sell than BTC. Any local jeweler will exchange fiat for gold. 
I agree that spending BTC is easier than gold.

The problem with Land is the same as fiat, you really don’t own it, the government does. Sure they’ll give you some paperwork and say it’s yours but push come to shove you bet your ass they’ll take it from you.

No, it wouldn’t. American dollars are quite resilient, especially inside a leather wallet. I think you are vastly over estimating the affect that 20 years has on materials.

I would say crypto exchanges are like bank accounts while wallets are like a wallet holding cash.

My analogy wasn’t for a hardware wallet holding crypto, it was a physical leather wallet holding fiat. I’m sure both will hold up for 20 years.

Sure but I’m sure I could still retrieve the money. No need to be pedantic.

Sure but you’re going to need more than a pc, you’re going to need a mining rig using ASICS.

Bitcoin is more like cash or gold than a credit card or bank account. There will probably be companies that get built around adding layers of protection for end users. That comes at a cost however, one of the benefits of owning bitcoin is the control of holding your own assets. Of course if you cannot protect your assets then maybe it’s better to let someone else protect them.

I hope that's logarithmic and not linear!

Just checked my email for the earliest mention of bitcoin. Got an invite to a bitcoin meetup way back in 2011. Unread.

The issue is withdrawing the cash in the exchange.

When there is a hard fork anyone who held bitcoin before the fork now has a crypto ladder in both forks. You need the private key to claim your crypto on both forks. When you hold bitcoin on coinbase or other exchanges they keep the private key and allow you to withdraw to your own wallet. This is what you want to do if you hold any bitcoin before a fork.

So a bitcoin wallet is basically a digital address where your bitcoins are stored. It has a private and public key, the private key you keep so you can send bitcoin and the public key is there so you can receive bitcoin. You can generate a bitcoin wallet for free using a desktop application or use a website to create your wallet. I've used  as an easy to set up wallet. It's super important not to lose your private key or your bitcoin will be gone.

How are prices for real estate? Have they decreased or increased? Can people even own land or is it leased from the government?
