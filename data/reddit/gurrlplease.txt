Took out all my initial investments. I’m just riding the wave ������
Anyone who has been in crypto knows we have had worse times than this. I personally remember buying btc at 1000 and watched it crash to 256. Great times.

It can be tried but not cracked, only if you get lucky.

I don't get it, what is it suppose to show?
@_date: 2014-03-27 16:07:31
Well i just thought about this. Why not just destroy your printer after it gets old or whatever. So no one will get your keys. Easy peasy chuck-e cheesy.

Hey op! Thanks for the response to everyone that is trying to help you.

That's ok i understand. I like criticism. Which parts are incorrect and i will make sure to change it next time i get to present in from of 17 and 18 year olds who don't even know how money works. But thank you.

I came here just to tell you that all that money in that dudes home was only about $300 million. Just to put in perspective that is only 2.5% of the market capitalization. Even mt.gox has more.

Well you have all your saving in Bitcoin, that isn't a very smart thing to do. I would just buy as much as you can afford to lose.

Mark is that you?

Nice way to promote your site.

Well if you want to be so secure of having a paper wallet you might as well take the extra 10 seconds to make it a BIP-38 encrypted too. This means even if they get your private key they won't have your BTC unless they can figure out the password. The key is not having all your BTC on one address. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 16:49:50
Maybe it's like a confirmation thing, like coinbase does to your bank account. But i would just transfer most of your BTC out of that address until you are fully aware of what is happening.

Is it me or does he have a huge booger?

So i am guessing the double letters were from his fat fingers hitting two letter at oncve.

Just stab him in the chin a couple of times.
