i love my ledger
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:06:19
but how do you trade when you want?  it must go on an exchange at some point
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:13:16
I feel the pain.  Honestly.  I lost all my coins in 2013 for a similar reason....I could do nothing.   
Only getting back into bitcoin now.
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:07:40
i lost all mine in 2013 ....crypsty
@_date: 2017-11-10 02:09:51
man,  so sorry.  feel for you.  HOpefully this gets upvoted a ton for some exposure.

it's very easy actually.
Stop the banks from allowing transfers to ANY site that deals with crypto.
Soooo....how are you going to buy and sell it?  Local bitcoins?   okay that might work...but if they ever put together an undercover sting (don't laugh,  they do it with Uber) that would kill that market.
Only people that have it will trade it, but what value will it have if no new money can come in? 
Banned.

quadrigacx  is better IMO
just use this as a starter site.  IF you want to day trade.  Dont.

Im buying every 1 k in price drop.
but Im running out of money that I can afford to lose!
need money!
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:18:28
me neither.  I just keep buying more when I can.
@_date: 2017-10-22 12:52:47
me too....just trying to get back in.
got so discouraged.
IM putting in 4k this week.  
Any advice for me?
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:34:00
don't do it.
I had my coin all stolen when Crypsty went down.  Hard lesson to learn.
If the site goes down,  some flees to China,  you lose it all! 
Get it in your control

Question about Electrum wallet.  Can I recover my coins if my computer crashes - but I had a back up of the private keys and address.
Likewise, with mycellium I believe they hold the private keys.  Is that correct? 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:42:34
can you transfer between wallets for free?  
like mycellium to electrum?
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:41:58


do you hold the private keys for Mycellium?
I have both mycellium and electrum but dont know what to use.
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:45:51


do you own the private keys in mycellium?
@_date: 2017-10-23 04:29:00
im in the same boat.  demoralized.  watching from the side lines.  only trying to get back in....hoping for better result. 
@_date: 2017-10-22 23:38:47
I had this happen.  had to uncheck everything.  And re-check the one thing I wanted (e.g. CAD and Quadrigcx)
@_date: 2017-05-24 17:51:02
I lost most with crptsy....  ��
