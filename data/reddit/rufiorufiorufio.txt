I mean, they can do it because they are. But this is not okay.

Where do I put it on my hardware? And what is the best place? And how do I transfer it. I apologize for the questions I just need to get it.

Also, no idea what the "keys" are... so if you could walk me through this, that would be awesome! I have gone up over 100% of what I put in, so now I want to make sure it is secure.

Yes, I assumed it worked like that (a paypal type deal). So now where do I store it? Everyone says on my hardware and I have the keys, but how do I get it from coinbase?

Alright, so how do I make my own key?? Lets do it that way.

Thanks for hosting your own AMA with me, I am finding this super duper helpful. I understood coinbase because- again- it is basically paypal with crypto. It has nice graphs, I can read news about crypto, and I understand it is fairly safe. However, I was also aware I was supposed to have my bitcoin on hardware. I just dont know how. So, again THANK YOU, so far this has been very insightful.

I have bitcoin in there... How do I transfer it out and where do I put it? 
@_date: 2017-09-05 23:15:51
I have bitcoin! I bought it with USD. I also have ethereum.

This has be supremely helpful! I am going to get this done with in the next few days! When I do I will let you know what my questions are, but this was way more informative than anything else I could find! Also, if you get my BTC in the next few days you know I missed a step! Ha. THANK YOU!

1. I would like to keep it and continue to grow it. I have bought in and believe in BTC. I bought and sold through coinbase for a while but kept kicking myself. So now I will keep it.  
  
2. Probably not. At least not for right now. I work in a small town, so they haven't caught up on the ability to accept bitcoin just yet.   
  
3. Less than 1k$ now, but maybe one day I will have a few thousand (we can all dream).
