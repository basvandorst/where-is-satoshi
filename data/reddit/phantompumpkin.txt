Dammit.  Time to go back to WebDev school...

Nice to meet you, wife.

So why then do you feel this organized group should be treated differently?
For example, why should they have a monopoly on the use of force?
They have shown repeatedly that they will abuse it.  
Representative democracy is hardly representative.  Take a look at America(we can ignore the Republic/Democracy debate).  Your "representative" when this country was founded represented about 30,000 people.  Today they represent over 700,000.  
How can you possibly hope to represent the ideas/beliefs/values of 700,000 people at once?  It's simple.  You can't.
What people tend to be pushing for, and what you appear to advocate since you're talking about Democracy, is nothing more than majority rule, which frankly is just as bad as a Monarchy in my book.  It really makes no difference to me if a King takes away my right to something, or if 51% of the people do.  It's still other people dictating what you can and cannot do.
The only real difference is a King just does it, whereas in a Democracy you spend your time convincing people that doing something is a good thing, even if it is not.  You're still "ruled" by a small few, regardless of how much sway you think you have.  There's a reason people with money get involved in Government.  There's a reason you see a small number of people owning the vast majority of information sources.  If you can't directly implement your will, you have to convince the people to do it for you.
Morality of a certain group of people having authority over everyone else aside, what logical reasoning supports this?

Except the problem becomes people won't take the initiative.  If we can just get people out to vote, that's usually considered a win.
Trying to get someone to become an informed voter is a lot more difficult.  The reason politicians spend all this money is to get their "message" plastered so much that even the most uninformed people have a chance of seeing it, in the hopes that they'll remember it on election day.
I'm all for trying it, but I just don't think it's that feasible.

Except isn't France dealing with horrible deficit issues?  Didn't they recently propose a 75% tax to deal with it?
It just seems like this is going to bloat the already bloated budget.  How much do we end up paying as taxpayers for this?  I'm curious how much this costs France.

Except as we have seen lately, this isn't as much of a safeguard as the founders originally had intended.  How many times as the Constitution been violated in the last 2 presidencies alone?


Will you stand a chance right now? Probably not, because you don't have the money to run a campaign. If you want to get to that money you will have to get close to those who are rich and powerful already, and they won't give it to you for 'free'. That is what I think the square weels are. Take the money out of politics, and the car will probably run a lot better. Maybe it will still not be perfect, but we'll see to change the next problem when we get there.
That is what I think is the best option right now. I am however (I've said it before and I'll say it again) open to hear alternatives.
This is the problem imo.  You'll never get this to happen, because in order for it to happen, the people with the money/power/influence have to agree to it.  
They won't give up that power.  So even though I agree that it might help, and would be worth trying, I think it's a pipe dream.
Even if we remove all money from politics, how do you run elections then?
Who gets air time?  How do you fund airtime?  Who gets invited to debates?  Do we have every candidate at any debate?  As much fun as it would be to try and watch 3,720 people debate at one debate, I don't think it'd be very productive.  
This solution itself presents a whole load of problems.

I'm curious now.  I run folding already.  Why not recoup some of my costs while support bitcoin?  :)

But he made it all legal.  That's the problem with thinking you can get a group of people who make the laws to abide by the laws.  Best case scenario as they make whatever they want to do legal.  Worst case, they just ignore the laws.

I've read most of those you mention.  Granted it was back in HS/College, but I've gone through their material.  
There's a difference between fixing your car(simple) and fixing a system that inherently leads to corruption(any consolidation of power will inherently attract those who desire power).  
The more apt analogy in my book would be your isn't working because you have square wheels.  You don't simply replace them with better square wheels, you recognize that no matter how much you change these square wheels, square wheels are not going to make your car run any better.  You must replace these square wheels with something that works.  
The wheels itself probably isn't the most apt, because it's a small portion of the car, whereas the democratic system is more along the lines of the entire car(it's difficult to just change the "wheels" of it), but I think you can get what I'm saying.  
Changing a piece of it that will continue to hinder or break it, isn't going to fix anything(such as voting out people you dislike, since they'll be replaced by someone similar).

Which reasoning are you referencing?  America is different than other countries.  In order to get national exposure here, you must do different things than say, national exposure in France.
America costs so damn much because well, it's America, and that's the price we've decided it's worth.
Other countries may spend less due to a myriad of factors.  I don't quite think it's an even comparison.

I hope they didn't cost 5 BTC...
