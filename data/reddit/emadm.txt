For those who want to follow in with some of your gains this year in an efficient manner I wrote this on Hackernoon:
Our charity (Ananas = Pineapple!) was built to tackle a big issue (rising ideological hate) using AI, data science &amp; crypto in interesting ways:  with our fundraiser being one of the first that is potentially tax-deductible for UK &amp; US individuals.
I think we are about to see an explosion of innovation at the intersection of charity and cryptocurrency (not just for tech projects!) and initiatives like this will help get it going.
Hodling isn't everything, making a difference is :)

That's the first half. The second half notes that other crypto-assets can be structured to offer tax relief for those switching.
If they can have a relatively stable value or even slight increase then it offers a much better option for those taking some profits off the table.

This is a primary, not a secondary so they didn't cash out but raised cash for salaries and building it further.
If they wanted to cash out they'd just do CoinbaseToken :)

This is an interesting basis for a more advanced model for Bitcoin in terms of the key classical currency components.
At the moment much of the analysis on Bitcoin has focused on base money, but with derivatives, loans and structured products on the way we need to focus on the likely impact of M2/M3 equivalents as the infrastructure matures.
The other key element over the next year is likely to be institutional asset allocation into the space, which would hugely ramp up "S" in this model and has distinct characteristics.

I wrote up my thoughts here:  it goes a bit beyond the Howey test, especially when they discuss the broader definition of "profits".
Basically tokens are likely to split into four:
1. Tokens that promise profits - scams
2. Tokens that hint at profit share from centralisation - securities
3. Tokens needed to access ecosystems - API tokens
4. Tokens based on scarce digital assets - Property (subject to CGT, eg BTC, rarepepe)
