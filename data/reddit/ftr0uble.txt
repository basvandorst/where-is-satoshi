Donate BTC to that address converted INR will be sent to NGO working for Chennai flood relief.
They are trying to raise donations for Chennai flood relief for those of who don't know about it you can Google.
There are a lot of NGO's in India working right now helping out people stuck in Chennai.
User on Twitter wanted to Donate Bitcoin. But NGO's in India currently aren't aware of Bitcoin and most won't even accept. So these guys are helping out convert Donated Bitcoins to Indian Rupee INR and transferring the amount to NGO's bank.
OP is legit know for quite some time.
