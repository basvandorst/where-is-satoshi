Future is anyone’s guess... that been said, based on the long crypto winter, so many innovation taking place and last few tentativas to break thru 4.2k it “seems” to me that there is some pressure building up to go above 4K...

Based on BTC fundamentals... be your bank / manage your private key! ��
Take a look at exodus.io, you will love it!! Extremely easy to install and use it.
Or go for a hardware wallet like Trezor** (you can find at Amazon) if you have a lot of money or is really concerned about security.
** sorry for the original “Trevor” typo...  :)

Although I have my restrictions with Segwit2x, in reality it is an ok compromise that will  definitely  help us move forward and allow our community concentrate on enhance Bitcoin adoption and value. 
It past the time to end this pointless +2 years  BTC FUD.
And to feel better about my concerns regarding Segwit2x  I just shortened a bit BTC and jumped into LTC.
