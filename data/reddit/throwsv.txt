I'm pretty sure their contract specifically states that they are _not_ liable for any trading losses incurred due to any usage of their terminal though (including incorrect data).

How is there a loss of supply? The coins are believed to be stolen, not destroyed.

Yes, of course, that's my point. Bitcoin is just like any other "real" currency and/or store of value (that doesn't have other uses). It's value is wholly dependent on people believing that other people will exchange it for goods/services.
If the U.S. government banned USD then I'd expect its value to drop dramatically as well. Difference here is, the U.S. government might actually take steps to "ban" (or at least make it difficult to deal with) Bitcoin in the future. Whereas they obviously won't be doing that with USD.

I don't disagree that Bitcoin has some properties that make it attractive as a currency. But if the U.S. government started to make it hard to work with Bitcoin then that would be a pretty significant property that would make it unattractive as a currency.


Yes, I am saying that. Bitcoin's ultimate use is as a currency. It just so happens that its other properties (anonymity, peer-to-peer nature, etc) potentially make it a superior currency. But any currency is only useful if a large group of people recognize it as such.


Also true, if you ignore "real world utility in electronics, etc.". (You don't need to ignore it's supposed finite nature though, as that is not a property that makes it "inherently" valuable.)


I think it's pretty well accepted that gold's market price would be a lot lower if people didn't speculate on it or use it as a store of value. Do you think gold's rise and fall this past five years (see  is simply due to changing demand in electronics and jewelry?

You are misunderstanding me I think. Bitcoin and fiat and bullion (in terms of its use as a store of value) are all only useful because people believe that other people think they are useful as well (and will therefore exchange them for other goods). 
A cocaine user doesn't care if the world at large thinks cocaine is a useful substance; his utility from it is simply the high its consumption gives him, not his ability to exchange it for other goods.

I don't know what you're talking about. All I'm saying is that Bitcoin is like any other currency. If the U.S. suddenly banned USD and said it would only recognize bottlecaps as payments of taxes and debts going forward then I'm sure USD's value would drop dramatically as well.

Bitcoin's supposed utility as a currency or even a store of value is dependent on the world at large recognizing it as such; drugs' utility as psychoactive substances has no such dependency on popular opinion. So, the analogy isn't really applicable.

If you believe the "official" story, then it had elements of both.

Here's a copy of the Bloomberg lease agreement: 
Relevant clause is 5a on page 12.
"The information and data contained in the Services are derived from sources deemed reliable, but Lessor and its suppliers do not guarantee the correctness or completeness of any programs, data, or other information furnished in connection with the Services. Lessor shall not be responsible for or have any liability for any injuries or damages caused by the Equipment or by delays or interruptions of the Services, from whatever cause, and shall not be liable for damages arising from the use or presence of the Equipment on Lessee's premises. Lessee is solely responsible for the accuracy and adequacy of data and information used by it and the resultant output thereof."
It goes on to state that even in the event of a lawsuit, liability would be capped at the amount paid in subscription fees to Bloomberg. (Of course this would all have to be defended in court were it to come to that.)
One of the big issues (outside of how massive and dynamic and sometimes error-prone their entire operation is) is that Bloomberg draws in so much data from sources outside of their control, and they'd never want to be in a position to be legally liable for that data's correctness.

I don't think they are actually legally liable for that kind of loss. But their reputation would (theoretically) suffer.

Or "fundamentals".

It certainly does matter. If the same security issue allows an attacker to co-opt their server processing (in addition to just stealing any private keys) then they can reprogram it in all sorts of nefarious ways. (Change internal account balances, direct it to slowly drain BTC while keeping under BitGo's limits, expose customer information, make fraudulent trades, etc etc)
