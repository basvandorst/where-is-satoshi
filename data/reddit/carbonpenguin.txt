Sooooo... 1 more order of magnitude wins it, or 2?

[Liberty Dollar]( was the Napster; then their centralized commodity stockpile got put in an evidence locker and the founder was jailed. Bitcoin is Bittorrent: unjailable anonymous founder and decentralized system. A few users like DPR get dinged by the State, but the systemic integrity is uncompromised by such attacks. Grabbing [a few tons of silver]( is a lot easier than shutting down a distributed computer network...

I'd been assuming the differential was due to gox being the most convenient exchange for carry trade from the West into China. Do folks think that's off base?

If anyone has the time and vision to try to start a bitcoin version of Intrade, I (and I'm sure others) would be potentially willing to invest some coinage...

As I put it in another discussion:
I think it is not an either/or issue. There's definitely a growing economy rooted in bitcoin's centered around the currency's strengths (micropayments, anonymity, etc.), but there's also a frothy speculative economy on top of that. However, my sense is that the froth is not necessarily a bad thing for the underlying economy. Rather, it is functionally providing start-up capital for new businesses by giving them the additional incentive of prospective appreciation of their earnings. However, as with most businesses, the majority of their capital is not tied up in cash, so a drop in the value from a bubble crash would be painful in the short-term for, but not entirely destructive to, the btc goods and services economy...

I figure after this crisis they'll have the beefyest security of any exchange. The psychology here is sort of like airline security after 9-11; a terrorist would have to be an idiot to try the same tactic, but people were still irrationally afraid to fly for months...

I am a partner on the  site, where we sell t-shirts, and the other co-owner put together a checkout system in Drupal that seems to be serving us quite well. If you want to know more about it (I'm the business, not the tech side of the team), there's a contact link on the site...

Hopefully we'll have the proper website up in the next week with articles on pages - thanks for the honest feedback :)

The fundamental question (which they raise obliquely in the post) seems to be whether Bitcoin's strengths over other forms of currency will give them an additional boost vs. Flattr.

For those people I use the narrative of a cooperative - it's a monetary system in which anyone can participate and benefit on an equal basis (to "mine" in the dollar system, you have to be a FED member bank; to mine bitcoins, you have to have a video card).

Some thought I had about how this sort of thing might unfold: 
@_date: 2011-05-10 13:51:14
Well, I've sold about twenty t-shirts through my store at  and have pretty much convinced a local screen printer to do my next batch for bitcoins. I've also bought advertising through operation fabulous, and have purchased an article for the upcoming publication "The Bitcoin Sun" with btc. So, long story short, there definitely is a nascent goods and services bitcoin economy :)

Just used TH for the first time today - I'm curious if we'll be seeing a price-war between TH and Gox over transaction fees? Mt. Gox is cutting to 0.30% from 0.65% for the next two months - If TH beats that, we'll know we have a competitive exchange market on our hands...
@_date: 2011-06-21 13:48:36
Absolutely spot-on.

That's actually a really clever idea - we're many, many steps from that level of organization at this point, but that's something to look forward to :D

"If the big miners are moved 70 minutes into the future while the victim is sent 70 minutes into the past, each new block..." Reading this decontextualized makes me happy.

Seriously. I don't day-trade and, as a merchant, I get annoyed by big market moves, but day traders do serve the purpose of keeping markets liquid. This is silly and actually against their interests *facepalm*
