the cryptocurrency community has honestly impressed me with how strange and out of touch it's community members seem to be. this whole "pm me i'll hook you up" mentality is absurd and uncomfortable and unfortunately becoming too familiar in cryptocurrency threads.

I have a macbook with a touchbar. A number of coworkers have the same macbook but without the touchbar. I am very jealous of the ones without a touchbar, just saying.  
There is not much utility in it having it. It demos well, and things like this silly app look kind of cool, but it's fucked. You can't have this silly crypto app focused all the time, you need to have it focused in your display as well (the focused application determines what's on the touch bar). So this is really just a shit UI on what has been built as a web application a billion times already.
