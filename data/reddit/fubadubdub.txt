double down on your losses, this is called "averaging down", and your $500 trade helps the 200 billion market cap increase.
Everyone here is going to get burnt so bad. Already are.

Cha ching.

lol. I'm loaded. It's OK.
BTW, you bought at the literal top.

Buena suerte

So you were down 50% in a month, and managed to sell -25%.
Let me tell you about AMZN stock, I bought it last January, held it through year, and it was up 50%+, and this year is already up 5% or more. If you like money, there are real ways to make it, that are far safer, even if you were to bet it all on one company.
@_date: 2018-01-17 21:31:39
If you think it will increase from where it's at, it's a good time.  But just because it has fallen 50% does not make it a good time to buy.  It could fall another 50% from where it's CURRENTLY at, and then take 2 years to get back to the current price today. Or NOT, who knows.
@_date: 2018-01-11 19:16:44
Bitcoin isn't an investment, otherwise I understand your point.
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:36:57
May be

Alternatively, quit giving into Bitcoin.

That's what everyone says, "when I'm richer I'll donate more".  Problem is, you never quite hit that threshold to consider yourself rich enough, but you make yourself feel better and more noble by saying one day you will.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:22:44
Obviously none.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:14:21
That's good for Bitcoin ;)

So...literally everyone? You should head over to , I think they have a community you'd be very interested in, the best community.

Good luck, I wouldn't want to see 10% of my "gambles" disappear everyday. At your age, that's a great foundation to create a real portfolio. Happy gamblings.

And if you invested $5000 at 20k, you now have $2500 to buy yourself a 1997 altima.

@_date: 2017-12-18 16:25:06
First in the market is not always an advantage when you are talking about staying power.  You're basically doing all the hard work for everyone, jumping through all the hoops, paying all the fines/whatever, and paving the way for others to very easily come in and reap the rewards.

You forgot the part where this is exactly what I've done and I will soon hit my leanFIRE number (within 6 months) and could be retired and live in Colombia (where I've been for 2 years) by the time I'm 30 in 3 years.  Without Crypto, oh well.

No one cares if you move your $3,000 of fiat into bitcoin lol..

I lost $17,000 on a stock pick I considered to be high risk in 2016.  The same can happen to you. Figure out if that fits your risk tolerance.

I live in South America also. I've spent no more than $700 many months while here. I've lived here for 2 years though. It's our strong dollar though, and high earning power. We're "taking advantage" (not negatively) of the situation we've been provided.

@_date: 2017-12-22 17:31:05
It'd probably be a good idea. I don't invest in bitcoin. But I do invest in the normal markets.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:09:40


We are talking about steady growth, your reply proved my point more than anything.
Edit: I know your post was long, but I wasn't commenting what you posted about.

This isn't true, in case people are reading this. I made a bad stock pick in early 2016 on SUNE, SunEdison.  I started buying at $7.50, I wish I had taken a loss at any point as it fell to $6, $5, $4, $4.50, $3.50, $2.50 - but I continued to buy on the way down. I should have cut my losses when I was down 10 or 20 percent. Instead I kept buying as it went lower and lower, and ended up losing everything when they went tits up. The worst decision I made was to even be involved, and my second worst decision was that I didn't sell when I knew better.

I lost 17k 2 years ago on a dumb stock pick I "knew" would bounce back up.
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:16:22
So you are making the claim that I can't learn all there is to know about Fiat currencies from that YouTube video? 
@_date: 2018-05-16 21:14:37
"Just buy low" - sage advice.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:56:24
Yes. I actually lost $17k over the course of a month. That's a lot of hours worked, lunches I passed on with co-workers, dates I didn't go on, concerts I decided to not go to, flight tickets I didn't buy, etc. Sunk cost fallacy got me good.
@_date: 2018-06-14 03:56:11
He has a point, it would cost me about $5 million dollars to figure out how the hell to mine an ounce of gold and forge it. That means the ounce is worth $5 million.
@_date: 2017-11-09 01:59:17
Wow, how have you managed to make money with this market?
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:12:23
I was kind of kidding. The US stock market has been in a bull cycle for 7 years, Foreign is up 25% this year, and bitcoin up 700% lol. But still, nice response.
@_date: 2018-03-19 16:15:28
That’s not what we are talking about, nice try though. Go recycle that response elsewhere.
@_date: 2018-03-19 15:30:48
Its down 60%, not 5%.
@_date: 2018-02-17 02:33:34
Technically, Technically is the best kind of correct.
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:11:48
This is funny because today it fell 25% lol
