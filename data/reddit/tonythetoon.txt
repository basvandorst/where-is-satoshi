I think thats a roll over excuse and sure you might end up pinched some day in the system but having worked in bitcoin for years, to start abiding by rules because of fear mongering by the press over transactions of a couple of hundred euros is playing into their hands. When something is the law its the law, its not up to citizens to assume the law on respect of (invalid) media opinions.
Collecting IDs or not from anyone in relation to bitcoin isnt going to stop them becoming a psyco and its not going to do anything to prevent them from using it (the sale would be through). On top of this, we know that there are entirely malicious state actors using all kinds of loop holes to collect data on everyone in the world for no real reason at all. Should a problem arrise with a transaction in the future that was linked to a terrorist situation, Im sure they will have all the data they need to trace the route of it but I suspect that as per the case of the Paris attacks, it will give them no solace (i.e. calls for encryption bans amid proof they used SMS - which was already broken, as per Snowden leaks)
I believe the panoptigon situation is coming (if it hasnt already arrived), I just don't want to help them rush it through. Thankfully I live in a country where I have that luxury (not US). And besides, if a terrorist wants to buy bitcoin and not be traced he'll go buy a fake ID, all these assumptions are mute as all of the state systems currently in vogue still have their limits.

No, previously this was the best they had
and it listed currency as:
FUNDS (DEFINITION 3 IN ARTICLE 4)
"funds" means banknotes and coins, scriptural money and electronic money as defined in Article 1(3)(b) of Directive 
2000/46/EC; 
Electronic money being defined as:
(“electronic money” has the same meaning as in the European Communities (Electronic Money) Regulations 2002 (S.I. 
No. 221 of 2002); and as below in Directive 2000/46/EC of the European Parliament)
ELEVTRONIC MONEY (DEFINATION Directive 2000/46/EC of the European Parliament ARTICLE 1)
(b) "electronic money" shall mean monetary value as represented by a claim on the issuer which is:
(i) stored on an electronic device;
(ii) issued on receipt of funds of an amount not less in value than the monetary value issued;
(iii) accepted as means of payment by undertakings other than the issuer.
Now updates to this have been added this year:
Some of which do nothing but add protectionist racketeering to banks business chain.
In the event of an unauthorised payment being made from his or her account, the holder should not lose more than €50 if the payment instrument was lost, stolen or misused.  A service provider that fails to act to prevent such a fraud after a notification of a loss, or does not require strong customer authentication when necessary, could be deemed liable for its client’s losses and ordered to remedy the financial damage.
This is bollix. ID wouldn't fix this issue. But Im not sure where they plan on stomping next.

I tried every server in the list, not one connecting. Not sure if its an attack or DDOS on electrum servers or something. Quite unusual

Ok, cant be much help to you then. I had linux and firefox which it doesnt really like. I set it up on a windows machine and it was fine (win 7 and chome is supposed to be optimal).
Id say go with electrum then its way easier. You can then bring it back to win 7. Might be firmware alright, did you get an option t update that on the screen? (hold both buttons and plug it into mytrezor)

Cool, thanks.

Look, bitcoin isnt money. Its just not. There are no laws that make it money or anything like it (in Europe - different in the US). When there are, Ill follow them, before that Ill follow my instinct. I sell computer code.


Dont take legal advice from Judge Judy, its pop tv and its not even real much of the time. Again, Im in Europe, countries are free to make different laws than the US (thank god).


Again, Im not talking about transactions of 10k, Im talking about transactions of 50 to 500 euro. There is a massive difference, do people ask you for ID when buying a laptop? Should they? (Obviously no.)


This part is correct. If someone comes to me wanting to shift thousands of euros worth of cash, Ill be looking for ID. If someone wants 100 euros worth, of coarse Im not going to ask, there is no legal precedence for me asking as its not the law and I dont make the law up as I go along (again, I wish I could, you seem to think you should).
If you are in the US telling me how it is, i can see why this conversation is falling to pieces, I live in a different part of the world and our government hasnt turned full stazi yet like yours. But its getting there.

Yes but bitcoin hasn't been classified as a currency. Its nothing more than an asset in law at the moment. Can be treated like gold coins, cars etc. Suspicious transactions start at 13k. (high value goods). This seems to be across the board. Nothing has been finalized in law on this side except on a county by country basis, and some countries haven't done much yet. Apart from that there was only the VAT ruling
@_date: 2015-11-26 13:06:23
Yes I agree in principle but also as there is no clear law we have the right to treat bitcoin as we wish until there is (within the current limits of money laundering - i.e. we should have to suspect someone is laundering money buying bitcoin no more than if they handed us 300 euro for a shovel or a dog). Assuming the worst is playing into a repressive rhetoric.
Also, should you be a regular seller, you are now responsible for 100's if not thousands of ID's, which may make you a liability for a larger problem much more than if you can just accept cash/bank transfers. Bear in mind, why should I need ID for bank transfers since there is a behemoth behind every bank purposefully to collect these IDs and if a seller was asked about a particular transaction, this machinery should give a strong lead (bank accounts require much documentation to setup).

Propaganda and through government collusion. Currently wages have been flat for years, prices on goods are rising so anomalies like shrinkflation, stagflation and deflation are hidden with bunk numbers and claims of a bright new future ahead and suffering the pain (austerity)  to get there etc. At least thats what it looks like on the ground here in Ireland

No that one wont work for me. This is a bit shit, electrum used to be the best wallet. Anything from their dev's on whats happening.

Was a problem yesterday intermittently. Shouldn't have to upgrade a 0.0.x release to work.
Seems to be fine today
@_date: 2015-11-08 12:31:03
Plausible deniability, could be rubbish, like a coke can or something, you were just doing civic duty picking up unsightly rubbish
@_date: 2015-10-20 12:05:10
Ok, transaction never sent then. Will try again later. Very slick setup though. Nice work
@_date: 2015-11-25 17:25:53
Im not sure this is true. Can you show me the law in Europe covering this?
@_date: 2015-11-26 14:17:37
You are again siding with the idea of assumed guilt, what difference would it make to have ID considering how easy it is to fake them? If a bank account is hacked, is that not the banks problem?
And what if it wasn't bitcoin, what if I was selling gold, all these same issues would apply yet it is not necessary to ask for ID for gold purchases in cash or by bank transfer.
I know there are a ton of bitcoin scams out there but there have always been scams. The only thing I believe a bitcoin seller need prove is that the intent of the person using the bank account they used to purchase or using the cash they are using to purchase is meant to purchase btc- i.e. protect the general public from MITM cash attacks. Otherwise asking for much more is defeating the purpose and intent of a free society. Its computer code, its value is determine by the people holding it.
I dont welcome the coming new order (Negative interest bank accounts, cashless society - total monetary hegemony by governments worldwide through these policies). But at least until they enact them we have the freedom to use our cash etc to buy what we want and until that changes I will walk the line rather than crossing it willingly to the more state forced side.


This line makes no sense. If I sold chainsaws (or anything at all, literally anything), maybe 50 a week in cash, should I be concerned that I dont have ID for the people buying them? Whats the difference with bitcoin - its just computer code.

Looks deadly, signed up, logged in with trezor. Tried to send some money to an account though and its not asking for my pin again and its not going through either. No error code, timer just keeps going down after Ive signed the transaction in another window.
@_date: 2015-11-25 20:04:19
Yes but not to transactions under 13k. Most bitcoin transactions are small, no different than buying software as currently defined. As they haven't defined it properly.
@_date: 2015-10-20 08:28:03
This just came out from the designer of colored coins (open assets protocol).
So its a private chain, can be independently verified, it builds merkel trees with the data and you can log each transaction every ten minutes into any distributed chain (set to work with bitcoin from the get go).
So you've got immutable distributed data with allowable changes but no allowance for movement of data outside the system.
