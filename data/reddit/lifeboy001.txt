I went a decade ago. There are three types of people there- Greek, west campus and east campus. Drinking, quiet types, and weird druggies respectively.

Not to mention Bexley was raided by the FBI in the 70s as one of the biggest producers of LSD in the US. There is a pretty decent drug culture on east campus.

I've been in education for ten years, and you sound like a great candidate to me. 
Definitely play up the music. I did and I'm sure it helped. It's my "thing" so it was easy, but you can still emphasize it. 
Botball is great. Look up MITs autonomous robot competition that happens during IAP (winter session). I think the class is called 6.310 or something like that. If you can't find it I'll take a better look but I was a 15/18 major. It's a big part of our academic calendar, and if you do your research and show interest in doing it as an undergrad, you'll look awesome. 
MIT has a lower median income I think, but that's because there is very little legacy compared to comparable schools. They also have an enormous endowment (sadly funded largely by the defense industry) so I got a partial ride. 
I went to an episcopal boarding school (also atheist) so don't let that bother you. I knew lots of private school kids. 
Feel free to message anytime

Good luck for sure. And stick with that mentality- don't waste four years of your life only working. A scary percentage of people there do just that.

Reversed actually. My post here reminded me of the story so I posted the til. I went to mit a while back.

You're better than I was. I had a 3.9 (we didn't have weightings) and was a varsity athlete in only one sport. 1510 SAT with a handful of 800s on SATIIs. I did jazz band and did independent piano study I guess, but nothing else too special.
I don't know how true it is anymore, but when I was there in 2000, a friend in admissions said you got rated 1-5 on academics and extracurriculars. Anybody with a three got booted. Any 5s got in, but getting a five meant national leader, not school valedictorian. So I assumed I had a pair of 4s and got lucky. 
To me it sounds like you're really pushing a 5 on academics. It's an awesome resume. Don't forget that they really pushed to make the school more "normal" so you can't get away with only academic extracurriculars. 
Edit: lots of friends are involved in FIRST robotics. Is that what you do? Network...it will definitely help
