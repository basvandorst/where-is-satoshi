A variation of this would work for apartment sharing ie. Airbnb. Have a locking device attached to the front door. Upon full payment and at the beginning of the rental period, lock opens (with pin), giving renter the front door key.

Of course it's "entertaining" when your coins are still nearly double in value. Lol

The problem with NBC's "reporting" and clickbait headline is that its words out of one Greek woman's mouth who lives in Ohio since 2012.

This is the opposite of why I love using uber. In and out with no thought of the "extra" on top. No need to do anything else but leave. Please don't make this a thing. If drivers feel they aren't getting  a big enough cut per ride they need to get together and talk to uber. Yeah bitcoin advertisement/exposure yadda yadda, great.

Yeah Andreas and Stefan are are awesome speakers, and to listen to them together is the best!!!! They lay out a future that makes sense. And Andreas is particularly on fire in this vid. (I saw the upload date as yesterday btw and thought it was new so apologies for getting your hopes up!) Be well!

Sure buddy get caught up in the semantics and the he/said she/said and waste more time that could be spent actually figuring out how to make things better. How to work with the planet in dealing with our huge population increase in the past 100 years. Our waste. Excess. Over taxing of the planet's resources. Call it "climate change", call it "global warming", call it a scam. 
The truth is, there is always a better way to do things. In the financial realm will it ultimately be "Bitcoin"? As far as the enviroment, will we figure out how to make the world a better place because of "Climate change"? Who knows? Point is, we need to head in a new direction as the human race. Let's figure out what that is so it can be the best possible for us and the world we leave behind.

That DEA guy is a fool! He didn't think any of his actions in that network were going to be analyzed with a fine tooth comb for both sides before a trial?

Can you point out where it says "Bitcoin" on this? All I see is "cryptocurrency".

I dont quite understand the snarky responses to OP's questions or points. It is irrelavant how long they have been involved in the bitcoin market. The "noobs" we hope will start using Bitcoin, ie the rest of the world, will ask the same questions. If they are met with the same sort of "welcome" they will turn their backs and walk the fuck away. 
Im invested in Bitcoin. I love dreaming about all the things good about it. Looking at things with a skeptical eye, sparking debate, is a much more necessary conversation to have here than another circle jerk about how great Botcoin is. In light of the current state of the market Id say its a pretty fucking good time for this actually.

This is both good and inevitable if Bitcoin is to be looked at as a serious player in the financial market. The price is so volatile because it is still held and being payed attention to by a small percentage players. There is an even smaller percentage of "whales", big holders, who are directing alot of movement up and down of the price. There is big money jockeying for large amounts of coin.  If you are invested in Bitcoin this attention is a good thing.

Is this the first company doing tipping like this? I know changetip obviously, but this seems like a logical way to streamline the ability for independent artists/etc to generate revenue from fans/supporters.

As someone who believes in Bitcoin, the more appropriate comparison for me is the same feeling I had in the early 2000s when the media first started to publish reports about Global Warming being a huge issue that people should start paying attention to. It was a very hot button debate because there was the side backed up by science that was like "yeah actually, Global Warming is real" and the other side who were like "HA HA you fucking drama queens! There's no such thing as Global Warming!" 
Feels the same somehow, we're several years past just getting FUCKED by the banks. No one has been prosecuted, and all the proverbial dust has been swept under the rug. Who knows if Bitcoin is the answer to all this? But it at least feels like a solution to the Monopoly money game our current representatives are playing with our future. 
So yeah, a little more based on science and math and economics and history, than say religious fiction fervor.

I don't have any problem with any of these country coins governments are toying with the idea of. I think its inevitable that in the coming months and years we'll be hearing about more and more government based coins based off Bitcoin and the blockchain. This is nothing but good for Bitcoin.  Governments can try to centralize and control their own digital coin if they want to but I think they will actually find that they will not be able to run business like usual anymore.

An added complication to this new network is the Bitcoin itself. Both networks are comparable in nature but with the blockchain you can own a piece of it. You must own a "vehicle" on which to interact with it: The Bitcoin. This gives it inherent value which at this moment we understand as a currency or store of value like gold which is a brand new complication to the rules we have come to know with the internet.
@_date: 2015-03-24 02:30:17
I think what you are saying is a cool way to introduce people to Bitcoin....Set them up with an easy wallet and show them the technology by sending them bits INSTANTLY. It is pretty amazing when you realize that the network doesn't realize the transaction was between familiar peeps.  Just an instant "trustless" transaction on the network. 
The exchanges and understanding purchasing are other steps down the line. 
The Rise and Rise is awesome. Just watched it too.
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:05:53
This may be an obvious choice but I like it anyway.....no bits thanks!
@_date: 2015-03-12 21:15:41
Take advantage of the buzz of this "revolutionary" thing called the blockchain that the average person doesn't understand. Use it in a completely backwards and centralized manner and control it however they please????
@_date: 2015-03-22 22:50:25
True but while the BTC network shares similar DNA to the internet internet, there are new problems to this one the early internet didn't have.

"*Billed* shall be the warmongers"......in the theoretical future he hopes for, Bitcoin is the ruling form of currency. This would make the start of an unwanted or unjust war by a government impossible because instead of being able to print fiat to "pay" for it, the people would be the ones with the actual wealth and the ones who would have to make the decision to pay for it out of their own pockets. This is something we do now but is not within our control. The mountain of debt we face because of it, is not just our pockets but our children's pockets and their children's pockets.
