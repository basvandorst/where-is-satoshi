There is a lot of misinformation about the miners standing behind the 2x. Not true. Miners are driven by profits, and they will mine where it is most profitable to mine.
Old fashioned Bitcoin is the most profitable way to mine it. Please keep in mind, that 1MB block size directly increases mining fees.
Logically, BCH was a break of New York Agreement, as such X2 developer team is no longer required.
Most of the people do not take sides and I do not take one. But people will be sticking with the most valuable fork, irrespective of the block size.
Conclusion: another meeting is required to avoid unnecessary secession.

Great thinking process. Many people are on the side, and it will take several factors to kick in.
1. Efficiency from Segwit, starts tomorrow. 
2. Rolled out and working Lightning network. I am testing it out, appears to be working. Will take a lot of load from the main chain and will boost BTC price in a big way.
3. Coinbase will release BTC in 2018. A lot of supply and a lot of sales in 2018
Finally, when people will want to cash out they will generally choose cheaper coin (if its BTH) to divest.
I do not take sides in the argument, but my models indicate that BCH will have a niche of in some countries, will cost 20-30% of BTC. In 2018, the price may drop dramatically.

This is a bit of conundrum, mostly because crypto-currencies are not properly and consistently treated by the different arms of government. For example, IRS is treating crypto as commodities, while FinCEN is treating it as money. Clearly, those agencies are pursuing different purposes. IRS wants to get their share of taxes when profits are made, while FinCEN wants to know whereabouts of the liquid assets and money. Thus the disconnect.
Like-kind exchange, also known "1031 Exchange", could be the avenue to consider and there is one aspect that is sticking out. "1031 Exchange" is not allowed for stocks in trade, securities, bonds, etc. Since, to my knowledge, there is no precedent of using crypto to exchange, then should you go this route, your decision may be challenged by irs and could go tax court or final determination.
It looks like you have experienced transactional loss and with proper records you might be able to claim loss.
That being said, If amounts are material and you want a second opinion, consider getting advice from CPA.

I specialize on advising on crypto currency taxation in US, and yes, if it is your brother's card, then, if there ever be any communication with IRS, it would be your brother talking, not you.
According to US rules and regulations US subjects are supposed to keep track on their gain (increase in BTC) value and pay tax. Basically, expectation is that you know the tax laws and you calculate, report and pay taxes yourself. As others pointed out, Coinbase should have a tool to help you to calculate, but there is more to that.
Mined coins are considered a business. Sales of the coins are accounted as revenue.  However you are are entitled to write off expenses associated with these coins. If you mined at home, you can write off electricity, depreciation, home office and many other expenses. Unless you are mining on industrial sale, most likely that tax will not be very high.

It does make so much sense. 
1) Ukraine is a large nation - 40 million or so
2) Ukraine has a large number of people working outside of Ukraine. That is their channel to send and receive money, as well as for Ukrainians to do business with the rest of the world. Ukrainians are entrepreneurial, generally well educated and have a lot of common sense.
3) Ukrainians know exactly what inflation is - they have seen a lot of junk currencies in last 100 years... probably 10 currency collapses. Generational memory remembers evolution from the Golden Tzar roubles, to Kerensky roubles, to Soviet money, to German Nazi money, To Soviet money again, to Soviet sudden/secret money denomination change (their war against cash) in 1961, to 1980's war against cash where 100 rouble notes were banned, to the collapse of soviet money, to switch of Hryvnia. Their national money, Hryvnia is just another third grade currency, which keeps losing value to finance the war.
4) Finally, Ukraine has so much room for improvement for their government, and BTC can help to keep their government accountable.
All of it makes Ukraine a perfect country for adoption. One Bitcoin ATM for 250,000 people.... is reasonable.

I do not know what will happen in the future. I do not take sides nor I have preference to any of the future forks. I just don't, I am however interested in success of bitcoin.
However, logically, those who wanted block already have their 8MB block, BCH.
What is really necessary is another meeting to avoid unnecessary forking. My concern is that fork between Segwit1X (core) and Segwit2x is clearly a matter of ambitions of fractured groups. Here is why: If block size is doubled, confirmation time will still be an issue, since it is so easy to spam (clog), and miners will still be making the killing from high fees/slow confirmation times.
Again, i am indifferent which version will become a top dog. My concern is that Segwit1x and Segwit2x are more or less equal and this disagreement will delay the growth of entire ecosystem.

Many CPA's do not have your interest in their mind, as paying more tax than you need to surely keeps IRS happy, avoids audits too.
Truth is that this particular situation does not have clear precedent, and I would take a position of not considering BCH as a regular income.

You are correct about GLD, you do make a valid point. GLD is special in a way that there is a lot of it accumulated in very large quantities by central banks around the world. It is concentrated in large financial institutions. Large financial institutions have learned to make few dollars by "lending" gold. 
Thus, this confirms that gold can be owned with certain financial instruments. However there is a price to it. Price of gold grew from few hundred dollars to almost $2,000, as there is almost unlimited amount of fiat to prop up the price.
Such increase in price happened because only a small fraction of investors took physical delivery.Somewhat similar, substantially identical situation already took place in china, where btc exchange used their clients BTC for something else.
Now, there are few differences, key differences here. Gold was not actively used for settlements and payments.
Bitcoin is both store of value as well as money with teleportation-like payment as a feature. People will be using BTC as digital gold as well as a payment method. Speaking in the terms of gold, many more people will take physical delivery of BTC
Now, you do make a point that institutions like Coinbase can in theory actually lend your BTC, thus paper ETF's in mass scale are a real possibility in the future. You already can get BTC margin accounts to trade on BTC fluctuations.
To summarize: it is possible to manipulate the price of Bitcoin ETF, as long people do not take physical delivery and increase in price is not that significant. However if price of BTC will go at that kind of rate and people will be holding private keys of their BTC in their own accounts, it will be much more difficult to manipulate and dilute the demand.
Developers are right: if you don't own the keys you don't own it.

That is a conventional thinking for those who have less than FDIC limit, $250,000. People and companies with cash above that amount are not insured and they are traditionally seeking safety in other assets, such as gold, commodities, foreign currencies and stock, as well as real estate holdings. Bitcoin held directly cannot be used for bail ins, as it happened in Cyprus as well as other countries.

40% tax would only be applicable to the short term gain, in that situation profits are taxed as regular income, at your ordinary income tax bracket. If investments were held for more than year, then lower tax rates apply, and it will be less than 40% for sure.

If Bitcoin would just stay stable after the crisis, that would be a major opportunity to scoop up stocks and other assets. So far, this has never been tested.
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:12:36
If it is a proper ETF which mimics BTC change, it has to be supported by assets, either directly or via derivatives.
As such Bitcoin ETF would normally increase the price of BTC, as buyers would be buying ETF which would immediately require purchase of BTC.
Please keep in mind that BTC market capitalization grew to a $70 Billion. That is a lot of money comparable to a very large corporation. 
It is possible to manipulate BTC price in the short term, but not if the trend is going up, not for a very long time.

Since you live in the USA and if you have capital gains, you may be able to offset your overall tax with standard deduction and exemption amounts.
Now, you mention that you are trading, therefore such revenues may be treated as a regular trading income.

I am convinced that they are spamming now. If I was a miner, I would make sure that there is always a backlog of low fee transactions in the mempool.
Most importantly, one can clearly see that spamming transactions are correlating with the workday schedules. Please note, that when BCH forked up, one nice beautiful day a lot of spam has been injected into the mempool. Logical, profitable, reasonable and totally makes sense.
Thus the only solution (to alleviate situation) is another tool which which is independent of miners. Off-chain LN. Long live the competition.

Difficult to judge. Bitcoin will slow down by 5 times if 80% of the miners leave, however hash rate will self adjust.
That being said, Bitcoin segwit1x has a lot of nodes. We really need someone to layout potential scenarios to us. 
Like I said, I think that the miners are indifferent whether to mine 1MB block or 2MB blocks. They are probably learning towards 1MB blocks since they make more money from 1MB blocks.
We really need Satoshi to weigh in into this, and I think that he would probably stick with the core.
Again, I don't take sides and I do not have a lot to win or to lose in all of this. But, logically, segwit2x is a distraction.

One source is here  From this website you can print a fancy looking paper wallet.
There are many other less fancy sources, of course.
Yes, buy yourself on exchange, and then send it to the paper wallet. If amount is not too high (let' say $500), you can buy from Bitcoin ATM.
Once you sent it, you can verify by entering public key to the blockchain info.
If amount is substantial (even if it not) make a copy for yourself, but god forbid do not use it.
Keep in mind, if private key is lost, any value is lost forever.

Who said life is fair? Some had btc and some not. I did not, but I truly admire and respect those who did. I am happy that there were risk takers and developers, entire ecosystem, has been rewarded for their logical decisions.
That being said, life is sometimes so predictable. When the next crisis will come, banks and central banks will dump gargantuan volumes of fiat money to the markets. At the same time, those who are well off will seek safety in BTC driving prices to insane levels. Yup. Those with BTC, can then buy their dreams.
In essence BTC will behave somewhat similarly to gold in pre-internet days. Except that it costs very little to keep BTC, costs relatively little to transport and there is somewhat anonymity related to BTC. btc is the new gold.

Yes, SW will make the blocks more efficient, however that does not impact the has rate.
You are correct about LN, however successful LN will completely change the narrative. LN will enable discussions about scaling opportunities, but not about block size.

@_date: 2017-08-18 20:01:47
Tax and tax rate depends on several factors: original date of when pre-split coins were acquired and when (if) you have sold BCH. Dates can impact whether this is a long term or short term gain, as well as the selling price of BCH could be used to calculate cost basis.
You obviously know that there is no tax if you did not sell BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-21 21:21:59
It is not too bad. Working as expected.

Very simple answer. Bitcoin miner sends his own funds to himself thus clogging the pipeline/mempool.

According to the current rules/understanding, one may need to do one time calculation upon mining bitcoins, deduct all the associated expenses (electricity, fees, computer depreciation), possibly allocate your own salary. If there is any profit left, then tax needs to be calculated. After the tax is paid, in essence one can keep them free of any additional taxes.

Well.... there are many things that they could do.
First and foremost, they can watch/snoop traffic to determine if someone is running a node.
Secondly, they can (yes, they do), bust several wallet services to undermine the trust and, more importantly, to force wallet servicing apps to report user information. They are already doing this to coinbase, where IRS started asking for money.
Just like many countries agreed on tools and policies to fight tax avoidance (not evasion), they can also agree to forcefully impose a set of rules that will severely cripple acceptance.
No, they cannot yet regulate, nor they can catch you using BTC, but they can force you to get drowned by tax compliance.
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:10:58
Well, I appreciate you doing the research and contributing meaningfully for discussion.
That being said, I don't think IRS would argue that it is an instamine. Mining requires efforts: machinery, code, setup. Fork happens without individual taxpayer putting any meaningful efforts. In my opinion, this argument would hold. I would feel very confident defending this position.
You are correct about absence of the rules. There are many other examples where not only there is no precedent, but some of the concepts are just difficult (or impossible) to enforce. Also, regulating Bitcoin, can backfire against other well established business processes.
