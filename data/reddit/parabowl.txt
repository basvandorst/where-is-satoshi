Man forget about the whole nitty gritty, the vibe of the conversation was so good!

If bitcoin is mass adopted then I have a strong feeling we will all be cloud computing as nodes for the network cuz it will be the world's main financial monetary standard above all the old systems cuz they just got phased the fuck out. PS I dono if what is in this image is bullshit or not nor do I care to go look for any evidence im just responding with my thoughts to whats written on there.

I think Andreas speaking abilities on bitcoin have gone beyond godlike.

That would be epic cuz just imagine the global reaction to that, people all over would flock to digital currencies in hoards in essence truly transforming from a fiat paper monetary standard to a digital currency which mimics gold but that would crash the entire world till everyone got back out of the water and into the new boat.

Sorry to say this but most likely the judge and the jury are both in the fed's pocket for this case.

The internet started as a decentralized community but has been modified ever since to be more centralized and user friendly because of that, what he wants is a new fork in the road per se where we have the regular internet but also a purely decentralized mesh networked internet. Kinda what bitcoin is to the establishment financial institutions of payments and currency.

LoL this guy should go and make his own centrally controlled  digital currency if he wrote this shit.

Im afraid we gonna see more insane sell offs and buy backs with the speculative crazies.

The only way I see a decentralized exchange working is if the legacy banking system implements the blockchain technology. Then you will most likely see people trading fiat into crypto essentially from their bank accounts. The only problem is that the banking cartels wont want to do that because that is like linking themselves to gold but in this case digital gold which is btc. They would be relinquishing the power that they have now which is endless creation of currency and debt.

They didn't print the cash yet its just numbers added to their balance sheets, once those numbers are printed tho thats when we start seeing rising prices.

Basically, he uses the computer to print a randomized wallet address on paper to have his bitcoins on. This address is not saved on the PC therefore its only located on the printed paper. After he has his paper address he simply sends the bitcoins to that chain of numbers and letters on the paper and woala bitcoins on paper, technically these bitcoins dont exist since they are not at either point of process, think of the Matrix scene where Neo touches the mirror right before hes freed from the matrix, well the bitcoins are in the tunnel in between the matrix and the real world, they will come into existence when he chooses to access the bitcoins from the address in a transaction.
He mentioned also in the video he does this with a completely new install of windows on a clean PC with no connection to the internet.

Dat's right bitches that's what u get trying to play with killer innovations. The fed's are gonna be crying soon as their cartel on money starts to fall like a house of cards.

If bitcoins do survive the onslaught of government controls and schemes then it truly is the currency of the next generation, if it fails well the idea is already out and ideas cant be stopped, those exposed to this new monetary frontier will move on and innovate new and better versions of "bitcoin"
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:23:05
The more that Fincrap woman talks then more I realize she nor anyone else in the government or their regulatory branches even have a clue what bitcoin is capable of doing to the financial shit system or how it is able to function so freely independent from it.

I want to say they cant do anything to it at this stage short of making virtual currencies illegal in the US, realistically its more likely that Bitcoin is being studied at the moment in order to figure out what to actually do with this new innovation in money which is their biggest problem because even bitcoin users and developers are still in the process of understanding and building on this foundation. The main advantage on the side of bitcoin vs the current financial system is exactly that. Because we the bitcoin users and developers are moving along in the front of the train and watching as the tracks are laid in front of our eyes, the current financial system is still trying to figure out how to get on and convert this incredible vehicle for their own agendas. Hope I provided a easy analogy to understand. xD
