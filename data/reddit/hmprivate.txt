:D :D good one :)
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:29:33
any proof? .. cmon.. saying "they lie" should be accompanied at least with some facts.. // again, I'm not saying I represent OneCoin - I am trying to understand facts. tx
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:30:55
good marketing move.. I'm sure this video was a good investment..
@_date: 2017-01-10 23:08:54
oh cmon... :/ with all the respect... I could reply with similar url, just changing one word  :/
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:55:21
information from a redditor as you seems to be very valid. impressive brain power behind bitcoin is one of the main reasons why I like it - and this is the reason why I did post this simple question here. but still, you have to agree, some facts would be good - liar can considered to be a liar only once caught red-handed. // yes - the concept is totally different from bitcoin, but some mining companies offer bitcoin cloud-mining as well and everything else could work and can be explained..
is there anything that can be classified as lie? is it possible to proof that the whole process is made-up excell sheet (could be a perfect modern crime)?
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:15:44
yes, I have seen links like that, still their community is growing and they claim that they have 7k+ trade point or merchants that accept onecoin.. I am very, very sceptical as well..
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:15:55
ok, I got it... I am looking for a knowledgeable podcast guest who can explain that. .. c'mon, that is simple, isn't it?
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:32:32
interesting resource. thank you.
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:26:33
.. I am trying to understand this market, recently did a podcast about that - free and open interview &gt; yes, there are more and more people getting into onecoin as the main thing how to make money there (at least it seems so to me) is to get referral fees from new referred members.. I haven't managed to find even 1 person (although have heard of some - it doesn't count) who has been able to covert his onecoins into cash.
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:22:43
yes, I do tend to think the same, but at the moment everything seems to be fine.. at least it sounds so..
look, it is so easy to shout: scammers or ponzi scheme! .. guys.. is there anything that can back-up your claims? tx
.. I have 0 onecoins.. just to be clear..
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:19:05
? what do you mean by that? .. their members cloud-mine them..
@_date: 2017-01-10 23:40:17
:o wow.. never know about their possible ponzi history. tx
@_date: 2017-01-10 23:38:12
thank you for the suggestion (really).
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:33:30
interesting claim.. would you mind sharing a link that could guide into that direction? thank you.
@_date: 2017-01-10 23:26:24
:D :D :D ... tx for the smile :D :D .. all the best! :)
@_date: 2017-01-10 23:06:09
hmmm.. this article is quite harsh 
@_date: 2016-11-18 12:15:20
are they somehow better than airbitz? thank you
@_date: 2016-11-19 09:29:45
tx - one more mention of circle... well, I have invested a bit into premium (2letter .be) domain names and circle.com is an impressive name already by itself. tx
@_date: 2016-11-18 12:01:27
tx.. went to  (tx subreddit designer for the link) and thinking of Airbitz Bitcoin Wallet - all green, does all three pc, ios (iphone) and android. thank you - huhh.. that was too quick :)
@_date: 2016-11-19 09:23:49
thank you - will check it out :)
@_date: 2016-11-19 10:15:49
circle doesn't look like a all-in-one solution for buying bitcoin with a card and then paying them for services/goods.. at least I can't see Scan QR code nowhere on ios app.
@_date: 2016-11-18 12:23:08
thank you - then I will stay with airbitz. all the best, H
@_date: 2017-01-10 23:34:46
good night all :) .. thank you for the opinions that mostly were factless..
here is an interesting one that actually proves your point: 
.. and for the dinner.. what if first approved wallets start accepting/storing onecoin let us say in 2018? ;) .. just a thought.. gn
@_date: 2019-08-24 23:32:21
good content doesn't become bad at facebook :/
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:57:03
just a question, nothing else..
@_date: 2016-11-19 09:28:06
tx. airbitz was my 1st choice of a wallet (I'm totally new here) and this is what did confuse me - I have to drive 1h to another UK town to buy bitcoin from some "bitcoin atm" :/
thank you
@_date: 2019-08-24 23:36:08
ok stamper, lets go... pls explain me how yt and g are better than fb :/
@_date: 2016-11-19 09:25:15
thank you.. one more mention of coinbase.. I don't know anything about bitcoin (have to admit), and have already stumbled upon circle.com at some other places - will check it out as well. tx
@_date: 2019-08-24 23:53:51
:) please reconsider your desire to be in tech if this is your main argument :)
ok.. cool, cool :) be well
@_date: 2019-08-24 23:45:51
is that an argument? .. please be so kind and explain me how big G  and YT are better than FB.
.. I like FB, use it every day and it helps me to connect to my friends and relatives around the world like nothing else.
what have you created that has changed the world?
@_date: 2019-12-16 16:03:40
:D :D amazing professionalism!!! :D :D
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:02:38
ho ho ho!! great job! ... hmmm.. you gave me an idea ;) tx
@_date: 2019-05-01 07:54:37
Great explanation. Thank you. And it brings up understandable issue: our btc definitions can be quite different.
.. for me it is the whole new infrastructure of much more than you just described. And a new step in human history.
Be well
@_date: 2019-05-01 07:40:02
.. not offended by you comment - totally legit and honest. Hopefully I could explain myself
@_date: 2019-05-01 06:42:32
short answer: $ has failed.
btc is clean start based on maths.
cmon :D these are basics ;)
you see, this was a sample of a question where a person is trying to get out an answer he already has got :) .. I prefer open questions that broaden the view of paralel thinking.
\+ I'm doing research for a fb live show we as a cryptocommunity will have this evening (one of our guys is btc maximalist)
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:51:35
good point.. any examples?
@_date: 2019-05-01 07:41:33
Hmm.. good point.. actually never thought about this perspective
@_date: 2019-05-01 07:58:54
;) also by your definition, btc was a shitcoin the first year it was launched &gt;&gt; 51% attacks were probably easy to be launched at that stage. Could it be the case?
@_date: 2019-05-01 06:02:27
.. never understood this crypto-subreddit specific down-voting practice :? ... isn't this a simple and legit question?
most of the people are afraid to ask it as some of you guys can be quite agressive.
\&gt;&gt; for downvoters &gt; stick your votes in your negative asses :)
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:50:57
here we go :D awesome :D
@_date: 2019-05-01 06:09:26


I always prefer to ask open questions and try to make them as short as possible.
my practice is &gt; people who explain their questions most often are just trying to squeeze out their own preferred answers.
does this answer your question? :)
@_date: 2019-05-01 06:05:24
:? this was something new... tx
... can I tip guys in this sub with satoshis? .. that's cool... need to explore more and transfer some satoshis here or find the way it is done..
@_date: 2019-05-01 08:26:36
Are you saying:
1) bitcoin has got problems?
2) the divine and sole purpose of all alt coins is to solve bitcoin problems?
@_date: 2019-05-01 05:56:16
oh cmon :D :D are you calling Ethereum a shitcoin as well???
2) Litecoin had a clean launch &gt; probably the 1st one in the history &gt; no premined coins and no dev bounties.. as far as I know from the interviews of Charlie Lee - he is proud of that (and should be).
@_date: 2019-05-01 08:26:55
@_date: 2019-05-01 06:27:53
in short: BTC was the first one.
for me the purpose I see: decentralised, organised and math defined money/payment system.
and yes, I absolutely love BTC and the doors it has opened, but the arrogance of many its users toward its further developments, versions, experiments quite often sound like coming from Natsis or white-supremecists :/
@_date: 2019-05-01 06:34:20
:D :D .. dangerous questions :D you sound like a Kaczynski .. deep thoughts..
sorry, getting kids ready for the school.. happy thoughts ;)
@_date: 2019-05-01 20:33:11
Thank you all. I can't express how this thread changed my mind on security issues and the whole industry. Be well all!! tx
@_date: 2019-05-01 16:50:25
:D :D
@_date: 2019-05-01 07:38:57
By comparing matching supremacy oriented attitudes - don’t you see matching vibes times by times coming from some btc maximalists?
.. + I can throw in the same supremacy shit basket many religious nuts :)
does it make sense?
@_date: 2019-05-01 06:06:54
%\^%&amp;\^\* !! :D that is how you change the thought train rails...
now the thoughts are into this tipping thing..
