I watched last year's segmant on crypto they had in Russian Annual Economy Forum and economists, politicians and entrepreneurs attended it. They said that those countries which will try to work against crypto will fall behind because for sure there will be countries which will adopt and work with crypto.

Who's talking specifically about bitcoin? if you read the context of the comment thread, tronxt said that the "global government" can stop CRYPTO by "outlawing" it. My point is that blockchain and, in fact, currency aspect of it can and will play a big part in progress. 
FYI, you can't develop applications on top of paper currency, but you can on top of cryptocurrency. I'm a developer and I've been putting together  simple smart contracts as a practice and I can tell you for sure that smart contracts themselves has a huge potential.  When Jeff Bezos was convinced that shopping online would become an inevitable aspect of internet in years to come, people didn't believe him. You didn't have facebook, google or amazon as they are right now when internet came around, it took decades to evolve into what we have now. 
If you think that it's unhelpful - good for you. 
Just my 2 cents.

Fall behind progress. Why do think banks, corporation and governments are thinking about adopting it after years of criticism. Blockchain has a potential to change many industries. It's ignorant not to realize this.
