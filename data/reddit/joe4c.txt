Buying at 10k or 13k makes almost no difference if you are playing the long term game. BTC will be upwards of 5-6 digits, accumulate as much as you can while you can at these prices.

Prices are going down because

2. Shaking out the weaker hands

China has been secretly buying up as much Bitcoin. They want to get a head start before announcing it officially. Once other countries realize China is buying bitcoin, fomo will kick in and they will also start buying. Thats when the price will skyrocket into 6 figures.

Banks are denying you to buy Crypto because Cryptocurrencies threaten their whole model. Banning transactions will only delay the inevitable.

This is how the markets work. 95% of people investing in the crypto space will lose money, because they buy when the price is going up and sell when the price is going down, while smart money is doing the opposite.

Most newcomers to this space will look at the ALTS as a cheaper investment with more risk but better upside, but their end goal is to make profit on the alts to eventually buy BITCOIN.  
There are already alot of HODLERs reguardless if they made profit or not. Smart money and financial institutions are ready to jump in the water any second now and the price will sky rocket.
@_date: 2019-10-18 13:22:35
Keep investing. Keep it a secret. Trust me, your patience will pay off.  Right now the mainstream has no interest in it, but keep in mind, its those who invest early who will be part of the incredible wealth transfer.  In a couple years, mass adoption will be greater and people like your GF and your friends will be pro bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-02 13:18:34
They cannot do any of these things you mentioned. Its illegal and not happening. The only thing that can hurt bitcoin is the entire world bans mining. It might drop the hash rate down by alot but there will be illegal miners mining.

Eventually, 1 BTC = 1 BTC. You will be able to buy everything using BTC, like properties, cars, etc. Im sure they will be priced accordingly with fiat. eg Lambo = 0.25 BTC, 3000 sq ft home 1.5 BTC etc.

I strongly believe in the Stock 2 Flow chart and it has shown in the last 10 years it is very accurate.  Add a zero every halving. 
$100k within 2-3 years, $1M after 2024 Halving, $10M after 2028 Halving, $100M after 2032 Halving.

It will not be used as a medium of exchange, but rather as a store of value. (eg gold 2.0)

it costs money to spend and replace. just alot cheaper to spend fiat, at this time. Eventually LN will become better and everyone will use that. Instant transactions for a fraction of a penny.

Even though its showing approx. $75 Million USD after the 2024 Halving, I'm going to assume by then everything will be bought and sold using Satoshis instead of the US dollar. Due to inflation, printing and whatnot, the US dollar continues to devalue and people will buy Bitcoin as a hedge against the falling dollar. I seriously think these numbers are the lower end of the spectrum.
@_date: 2019-10-02 13:02:47
Guys keep in mind FIAT will eventually become worthless due to hyperinflation. The chart above is adjusted to show what it could possibly be worth. Eventually you will not be buying anything with FIAT anymore just BTC or Crypto.
@_date: 2019-12-18 16:14:00
If you look at each ATH, they add another 0 or digit. So 75M is proper

I guarantee the USD will not be the currency the rest of the world uses by 2028. The US keeps printing more and more worthless paper money every year continuing to devalue its fiat.  BTC will become digital gold 2.0 as it passes the market cap of gold, and everyone will be buying bitcoin as a hedge against the devaluing fiat.
