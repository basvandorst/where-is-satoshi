As long as you have the seed to your wallet written down somewhere  safe (typically a bunch of random words), then you can just recover your wallet. You'll only be out of the money you spent on the HW wallet.
Like magpie said, treat your HW wallet as your bank account, and your mobile or desktop wallet as your primary method of sending or receiving funds.
Ledger wallets are pretty nice, so are Trezor wallets. I don't hear much about the others out there, so I would stick to one of those two. The Ledger Nano S is the cheapest HW wallet available I think, and it supports a ton of altcoins as well.

try [bitsq]( trades take longer, but you don't have to deal with any KYC shit, and your bank won't be able to tell you're trading bitcoin/cryptocurrencies.

The electronics will likely get fried, but your bitcoin isn't stored on the HW wallet, only the keys to access it, and you can recover those keys with what is called a 'seed' (which you will have to write down when setting up your HW wallet). You'll have to get a replacement wallet before you can recover your keys though (probably the same as the one that got wet).
Just keep the piece of paper you wrote the seed on in a very safe location. Nobody else should know where it is, unless you trust them absolutely, and/or are on your deathbed.

Steam games, and Amazon gift cards on Gyft mostly. Although you can't pay in bitcoin on steam anymore :(

I'm a little out of the loop...are there any risks or disadvantages to transferring the btc on my ledger wallet to a segwit address?

Np, it shouldn't be too expensive to have printed. It might work at 0.2 layer height if you want to reduce the price a little, it definitely works at 0.15 layer height though.

For 8.5mBTC each, I'll make one and ship it to you if you live in the US.

You might want to check out 3dhubs.com, that'd be cheaper &amp; faster.

It works like those USB sticks that retract into their case.

The HW.1 used to be the cheapest hardware wallet on the market, before Ledger stopped making them &amp; raised the price.
