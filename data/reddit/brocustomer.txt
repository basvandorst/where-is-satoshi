Good work, it sounds like you are a dedicated individual. May I make a suggestion on how to use your time more effectively to participate in Bitcoin: 
Since it sounds like maybe you are supported by parents and have low overhead costs, get a job where you can invest your pay cheques in BTC. Instead of $5 for 3 weeks work, you'll have $500 - $1000 from your pay check that you can invest in BTC. Better yet, ask to be paid directly in BTC.

If you're grabbing a coffee every day anyway and simply meet the counter party for this coffee then you're good to go.

Props to the community. This is proof that we can work together to protect Bitcoin and achieve success.

I like Virtex for a few reasons: 
- They are Canadian and have actual staff in Canada. Some of them work remotely but are still located in Canada meaning that the team is for the most part local. 
- Virtex is a Canadian incorporated company. They are subject to Canadian laws and (used to) hold Canadian bank accounts for storing deposit money. I believe the bank they currently use, DC Bank, is also a Canadian bank. 
- So far they have been responsive to my needs although it does seem that they are under staffed. I know that they recently hired more staff to cope with demand so I hope that anyone who has had a bad experience with them due to wait times etc will have a positive experience the next time around. 
Basically there are a legitimate Canadian business which is more than can be said for a lot of Bitcoin related initiatives as of late. Due to their prominence in the Canadian market, I find them *least* likely to run off with everyone's coins and cash when the price rises.

Thanks for posting this. I was watching a lot of Kim.Com videos yesterday and thinking about how relevant this all is to BTC and the decentralized movement in general.

In response to your question, I told my Brother who to get in touch with if something should happen to me. He doesn't know how many coins I'm holding but knows to get in touch with person "x" and then the two of them can find someone they trust to cash out the BTC.

Go Argentinaaaa!
Edit: To give relevance to this comment, they have 20%+ actual inflation there and people are reportedly buying new cars as a store of wealth. Bitcoin is just what they need.

I hope you guys make a profit for your contributions to the network and I wish that I had the technical abilities to have a similar setup. Coming from a finance background though I'd say that there is a serious risk that not enough financial analysis in this investment has been done. I know that there are variables that are uncontrollable with BTC but shouldn't the financial models have been the first thing you looked at? After all, I assume you're in this to make a profit but that might also be a faulty assumption (maybe your intent was to contribute to the security of the network). Anyways I do wish you luck and thanks for posting that sick looking cabinet!

If this were real I'd buy it in a second!
