Did that really just happen?

I'll donate .002048 when I'm home
@_date: 2014-03-18 18:28:20
Ohh, I see, that makes sense, it might be a publicity stunt to just boost the amount of users, thinking it's a place where many coins are traded when it's really people trading with themselves. Oh well.

I'd give you gold if I weren't on mobile right now.

What is very unique though, is that every single country in the world has a shade of purple, it's known to some extent in every crevice of the world.
@_date: 2014-03-20 10:51:46
Very interesting

First ever? I don't think so.

Well, the fact that you can see that they're still working on it rather than making a plan to ditch everyone is already a good sign.

At least set up free wifi and suggest them to use bitonic.nl
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:38:25
    &gt;tfw there's still no .nl I have to check on everything to see if they ship to the Netherlands. :(

This is advertisement, normally I'm okay with people asking for publicity, but for casino's it's a different story. Have a downvote.

I like the optimism but the purple line is entirely arbitrary. 
@_date: 2014-03-20 09:04:56
THanks a lot ! I never knew.

Some people on their team browse I hope to see this question answered.

I'm guessing they don't want hookers to become too big. Their website is more than just that.
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:22:52
Hmm, odd.
@_date: 2014-03-23 16:57:12
Em, so... where will you be streaming this? :$

Just because it's a large amount, doesn't necessarily tmean it's stolen. It would be nice if bitstamp could figure out the identity of the person and let them do their own research, but I don't think this can be considered as conclusive evidence.

[I did it!]( Basically you should try to keep the highest numbers in one row or column, and never move it around, then just keep adding numbers to it from the row closest to it. EDIT: [How it ended](

Paypal getting involved with bitcoins? I shudder just thinking about it.
@_date: 2014-02-19 09:39:39
Can you back that up? Why do you think so? Or do you have money in there and trying to be optimistic?
@_date: 2015-02-14 11:49:54
Way to ruin the joke bro
