If we had a whole room do them though could you add the hash rate of the class together to get an overall hashrate? Because the coins would be of limited selection you could get results as a class could you not?
Also, I'm not a teacher. I'm a tutor. I tutor Computer Science in my school for our math lab so most of the people in the CTE programs are in my tutoring sessions (hence my students). I do it for a program at our school called "Math Lab" (since CompSci is a math credit) run by Mu Alpha Theta. So technically speaking they aren't "my" students, but I'm qualified enough to teach them. I use the same computer lab as the Accouting class, a class I was previously enrolled in, and there are times where they just watch Shark Tank, in which case they could mine and be somewhat productive for the program.

Ya, I've found some information. Not sure if I want to mine anymore. From what I'm finding my build is horrible for bit coin mining.

So, as a really dumbed down explanation, miners start mining a block before the block is full so that by the time it's full the block is already validated?

If only Android had kept their usb mass storage device option I could have run Recuva and gotten the files back :(

I don't need to be chided. I just wanted to know if it was recoverable.

No, you can't. You obviously have no idea how this works. Miners are the voice of Bitcoin. The technology literally can't be implemented if the miners don't mine it. You also can't just go get new miners without making in altcoin. Majority rules, and those who don't mine get no voice. You want to vote? But yourself a $500 machine and get to work.

You can ignore us if you want, but we are 100% of the vote. Any new technology implemented into Bitcoin has to be mined by the miners. Ignore us all you want, it doesn't change the fact that you have no voice.

I have the address...but that's about it...
If you can recover the Bitcoin it wouldn't even go on my mobile wallet. It would go on my desktop wallet which I have backed up on three physical drives as well as my cloud. The internet would have to go down for me to lose that data. I'll even give you $10 worth of the Bitcoin.

You are so stupid. You literally CANNOT make a transaction unless a MINER VERIFIES IT. Bitcoin is USELESS without miners. The ONLY way you can get rid of the "misbehaving" miners would be to switch algorithms. If you did that at this point Bitcoin would lose all its value as it would become a target for 51% attacks and other technical attacks.
You cannot abandon miners. Bitcoin literally does not work without miners. If you actually understood what the duck mining is you would also understand why we are literally the only ones who can vote. New types of blocks are not created unless they are mined by miners.

Does this mean I have to update my p2pool in some way?
@_date: 2015-08-04 00:18:34
I know. I'm just pretty upset about all this. It was completely my fault this happened and there really isn't a whole lot I can do to fix this and that's what I'm beating myself up about so much. I realize it's completely my fault.
@_date: 2015-07-13 17:41:22
But what if you could make a simulation (fork a test chain)?

Why is this block size debate even a thing? Bitcoin isn't that popular to where we need to increase the block size and even with the DDoS we were fine.

Their Twitter says all the Bitcoin is accounted for.

Wallet 14.1 is fine for the hardfork, right?
