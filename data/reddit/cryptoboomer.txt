Had the exact same problem, took them three weeks but woke up one day approved and happy, just (continue to) be patient you're good.

Women account for 80% of BS spending/consumerism. While people can be naive re priorities or fall victim to the system of debt slavery, I do have a heart and live phylanthropically and don't blame them. The system has you all fukt up and this is a chance to crawl out of it. If it's a scam or ill intended that's fine I'm still doing my bit re good karma and not living cynically once I've reached abundance (not stupid either, I filter shit rather well).

Total assets: Zero?
Let's keep in mind it's decentralized, yet if we were to count all crypto 'assets' like all mining equipment, graphics card manuf., accessories like nano/trezor, exchanges/rev, power companies profits from mining, 3rd party sites monetizing the whole eco-system in various ways, the ad revenue when mainstream blasts news about crypto, the global community, it being a gateway to other assets/cryptos, and probably 101 things I'm not thinking to include - would probably topple this whole chart.

This thread touched me - post your BTC address for me I'm going to bless you a bit (I think others might too).

That's very modest of you, and makes me want to do something nice for you+wifey even more. I even got a few messages saying "it's a shit post, don't fall for it, blah blah".. I know this is a bitcoin sub but I'm heavy in iota, if it continues to moon, I'm going to come back here in the future and bug you to check up on you. If you're still not hitting big I'm insisting on spreading my goodwill (sometimes you just gotta win in life, don't reject when the universe blesses you, please paste your btc or your iota address).

^ lol nicely put. This guy is solid, his wifey's love is indeed touching many here. I hope he's showing her this too so she can knock some sense into him haha. "Hi cool wifey, if you read this - you should teach other wifeys how to wifey".

Nice. I haven't seen the other ones but you should get him to do an 'after' version, once it breaks through the wall to freedom.

Put the originals up for auction vs trying to sell prints. Beautiful work and concept screw the haters art is subjective.

..."when substantial portions of billions and trillions of dollars need to take a position or be left behind by their investors asking them why the haven't."
^ very much this. 2018 may be the final low point on the grand s-curve before the next/biggest boost none of us were prepared for :)

Why would it dip before the fork? More than likely going to soar as people acquire btc more and more just before it. The question I think would be: Todays price of x - will probably rise to y - after the fork MIGHT dip, will it dip back to x (todays price), or below it? My guesstimation is no it won't. Random internet guy guess = It goes to $7400 before the fork and back to $6800 before another bounce. therefore buying today is probably going to be your best bet (not advice just opinion).
