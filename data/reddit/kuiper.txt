However, it would make sense for a retailer to accept bitcoins for larger transactions.  For example, your average Best Buy probably makes multiple $1000+ transactions on a daily basis with people buying new computers and TVs and whatnot, and the amount of money taken by the credit card company for such transactions is non-trivial.  Similarly, I can see it working for outlets like furniture stores, where transaction volume is low.

The games that debuted as part of the Orange Box in 2007 (HL2 Episode 2, Portal, Team Fortress 2) included a developer commentary mode, which allowed you to play through various maps with large commentary nodes which, when activated, would take control of the camera to highlight various features of the environment as a recorded voice explained the design processes behind certain elements included in the game).  In all of these, the first voice you heard was Gabe Newell, who would briefly explain how the commentary nodes worked, and requesting that people direct their feedback to his company email address.  [Here it is in action](
As recently as several years ago, lots of people reported receiving personal email responses from messages sent to Gabe Newell's public email address.  (I myself received an email reply from Gabe Newell in February of 2011.)  However, I have no idea if he still keeps up with it--the volume of email he receives must be enormous at this point.
