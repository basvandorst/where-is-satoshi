Rydan you have right this method to delete something from coinmap is quite exagerate, there should be at least a double check. I will verify tomorrow.

I just contacted the manager, he said they still accept bitcoin, maybe a misunderstanding due to the high number of people that works there. BTW tomorrow evening we have there our local meetup as usual, I will verify on person.

We where this night at Yellow bar for our regular meetup, I asked to pay in bitcoin, the first waitress did a strange face, the collegue says yes no problem. I explain that there was some people asking the same but he could pay, he answer me that they have a really high turnover, like every 2-3 weeks new people so not all the personal is fully trained.
Now Please re add on coinmap bitcoin payment:yes and next time try to do a double check with local community before act like that ;-)

Thank rhcastilhos for the question. The platform will offer to users different options, in function of who they are [1.single citizens, or 2.local organizations (school, hospital, municipality)]. If they are local organizations, they have to provide a certain number of documents that we verify. In case of single users, they have more options with specific consequences:
-they can insert on their own information about their address without any verification, but they will receive donation ONLY if they will be selected directly by the donor that is aware of zero verification process;
-a second step is to pass through a geo-veirifcation process that involves 2 options: upload a document (Jumio style) or request for send check by snail mail. There will be (hopefully soon) a beta test where these and other options will be evaluated to avoid "geo looting". Every new idea to improve the service is more than welcome, write us to info
