Sorry, Didn’t mean to argue...
It’s just dollars are divisible, and so are bitcoins.  
That’s what I’m surprised people don’t understand.

There are ways for fractional share investing, or I have partial shares of different funds. 
But bitcoin is not a stock. It’s like saying you can only have whole dollars.

Ouch... use coinbase pro?
@_date: 2019-10-03 21:20:34
Is it now?! Gee I hate coinbase...
I could just log in at pro.coinbase.com and transfer btc, sell, then transfer usd back... maybe that’s changed

People have a need to trust people that are responsible for their things (doctors with their lives, bankers with their money, etc).
It’s one way people are broken. They trust based on their own need more than the trustworthiness of the entity that they’re trusting.
It should be the opposite, but that causes that cognitive dissonance thing...

I think that means you meant 96.7MWh. 
Just checking, I haven’t done the math recently.
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:45:17
Do you mean 97.6 MWh or 16.3MWh (10min average block time)?
@_date: 2019-09-03 21:54:36
Depends what you make it out of
