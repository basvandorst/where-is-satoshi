Seems like you didn't set your mining fee high enough, so it's not getting included in any blocks. I goofed up and used  to accelerate the tx. They do 100 an hour, so get it queued up.
Otherwise, it'll eventually get dropped in a couple weeks. There's some guides saying to double spend it with a higher fee, but idk the details.

Really great idea for a site. I took a data structures class last year- learned about recursion and trees, etc- and  was in the shower one day when I seemed to all of a sudden grasp how Bitcoin worked. It was overwhelming and I thought of it as the world's most expensive clock. A way to *prove* that something happened at a certain time. It seems more valuable to me than replacing the dollar.
You find a court to accept this site as evidence, it will be a watershed moment for the protocol.

Kudos for taking the step to communicate with a regulator. Bitcoin would be a lot better off if people were as interested in creating the political infrastructure as they were the technical and financial.
Also, I think this is exactly the right way to think of Bitcoin. Efforts should be made to raise money and pursue legal cases that rely on the blockchain for evidence of fact.

Um. Yes. Were you being sarcastic?
No, seriously: what do you think a good annual inflation rate is? 2%??? That means a currency loses half its value in a few decades. It's not a big deal: almost nobody who understands investment keeps their wealth in the form of currency over the long term.
Losing half your value overnight is a big deal.

Because the regulation isn't regarding the generation of random numbers, it's regarding financial transmissioins. The machine takes dollars and then uses the Bitcoin network to move coins from the ATM's account to yours. It's black and white; it's a financial transmission.
There are some issues that arise in technology that our laws haven't yet been updated to address, but this isn't really one of them.

I did a paper for my political science class on the Riegle Neal Banking and Branching Efficency Act, which helped spurr this on. It was passed during the Clinton administration- some people (mostly frustrated liberals) like to remember Clinton with rose-colored glasses, but he did as much for deregulation as Reagan. 
Young people today don't remember a time when politics wasn't dominated by neoliberals. It's ironic to see this posted on r/bitcoin, because, while it might be used in anti-bank arguments, it's very much a product of deregulation. A person who looks at this graph with disgust arguably should be in *favor* of government regulation.

Delusions of grandeur. China's been able to hold such a large influence on the price of Bitcoin because they're the largest source of demand for a new reserve currency and people had pinned a lot of hopes on that.

Market forces are like nature: there's no morality involved. If there's a moral byproduct, it stems from the benevolence of the rich. 
We're arguing about human nature: your argument depends on people being mostly good. I don't think that's true. Everyone has the capacity to commit the worst of atrocities and anarchy doesn't bring out the best in people. 
I appreciate the well-thought out response, but I still disagree with you. If the police are privatized then only the rich will have police. Now, I agree that the division of nations creates disparities in safety between countries, but a logical response to that seems to be a global state; not a global anarchy.

You're wrong: regulators, pursuant to the powers granted them by the legislature, DO make law. There are even federal regulators with the power to remove state powers. If all they did was interpret law, they would be judges.
The fact that your transaction is stored as a hash code that would fit on a tshirt makes no difference. An ATM does nothing but send messages back and forth with a bank, that doesn't mean it can't be regulated because it's speech.

A common answer seems to be "aiding the defeat of fiat currency", but this seems to be a very niche interest, peculiarly concentrated amongst techies (I think that has to do with Silicon Valley's proximity to the 'Old West', but that's just my current theory).

Your preferences aside, there's nothing in the Constitution or any Congressional provision demanding there be a personal victim for something to be against the law. The laws against money laundering were duly passed by the people's representatives.
They're pretty logical, because without them the government can't enforce its regulations. In my opinion, the assertion that the right to launder money means "everything" to bitcoin is a good argument against bitcoin.

I think people are confusing their disagreement with some particular laws and the severity of the punishments for breaking those laws (certainly I think there are bad laws/criminal justice system) with a legal argument. Duress has a legal definition more specific than what was copy/pasted from websters and it's not as arbitrary as people are makin it out to be.

I don't mind nit-picking! But know that there are many different definitions of democracy- most include the US.
Yes, the state uses violence as a tool, but that's what defines the state. It holds the legitimate monopoly on violence. It compels people to pay taxes through threats of violence and in turn is able to use that money to provide public goods that otherwise wouldn't be possible, because of the irrationality of voluntary collective action.
One of those public goods is central banking. The more I talk to people (and I really do try to have an open mind), the more that sticks out as a major reason to oppose bitcoin. It's success weakens the state's ability to macromanage the economy and it doesn't replace it with anything. It's a move towards anarchy.
@_date: 2014-03-18 17:41:54
No- the constitution sets up the rules for a federal system. It doesn't say anything as to the size of government. True, the Bill of Rights is about limitations on government, but the rest is about what powers the national government, as opposed to state governments, has. 
As far as the Commerce Clause goes, the Commerce Clause really does give Congress a lot of power (assuming, of course, that there's a large amount of interstate commerce). Congress simply chose not to exercise its power to regulate interstate commerce until the late 19th century, so maybe that's why it seems to have expanded.
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:18:35
Well, thanks! Yeah- initially I thought, "well, I'm always interested in a new tech..." but it really is anti-state at its heart.
You say that this isn't about the last 30 (or whatever number) years- that it's an argument that goes back further than that. And that's true. This talk of fiat and flat currencies goes back to William Jennings Bryant and before. But I think that Bitcoin's growth has depended on attracting the people disaffected by the 2008 financial crises- this disasterous culmination of 30 years of a sort of 'privatized Keynsianism' (to borrow Collin Crouch's term), which saw governments encouraging economic growth via consumer debt and ever-increasing financialization, along with a host of other terrible policies. So, you argue that this isn't regime specific and I know that it's not for you, but I think that Bitcoin reflects a resentment of government and finance in society, which was also reflected in Occupy Wall Street and the Tea Party. I think that the rise in price has been fueled by people who understand in a general sense that things aren't working, who grasp the basic concept and hear whispers of "the internet of money," and are motivated by the thought of not missing out on a good opportunity (both through mining and the exchanges). I think the sort of philosophy you preach is probably learned after people have already decided to "buy-in" to Bitcoin and even then not all Bitcoin users follow the logic to its inevitable conclusion (I think this explains the rise of Dogecoin in popularity; even if it has the same basic premise underlying it, the rhetoric is much different).
You make a good point that Bitcoin, as a currency (although, I seem to sense a shift towards people around here labeling it a commodity, though I know you'd say a currency *is* a commodity), is impressive because it hasn't been forced upon anyone. And you're right about the crimes that governments have committed for economic growth. I really admire the ambition and the energy of the Bitcoin community. But I think it's misguided by its faith in markets. 
Democracy (and I've heard talk about Bitcoin being a 'democratic' currency) isn't about having the longest block chain, it's about the government that's chosen by the people. The state has the legitimate monopoly on violence because its been given that power from the people (in a democratic state, of course). The people authorize government to regulate economic activity precisely *because* the market often produces a suboptimal outcome. It doesn't do a good job producing things that make everyone better off, like a public school system or infrastructure construction, and yes, management of aggregate demand.
Bitcoin's growth really is impressive, but each boom in price is more difficult than the last (whether holders of Bitcoin require a certain rate of growth to maintain belief in the network is a seperate question). Obviously if it were to become the dominant global currency it will have to increase in value quite tremendously. I think this growth necessarily requires an ever-increasing moderation of anti-state rhetoric and we've already seen this. So we agree that it doesn't pose a threat to the state in the immediate future.

It's states, not the federal government, that has police power in the US and with that comes a lot of power. It varies from state to state, but a large number of government actions already are local. Police, fire, water, streets, public schools… and the result is that local boundary lines are used to segregate classes of people. The black neighborhood doesn't have the school districts of the white neighborhood with the higher property taxes, etc.

It's in the parent comment: "[Bitcoin's] value will increase with the contribution of the parties involved in this network." Look at the front page of going back a few weeks- a *huge* amount of effort is spent finding and promoting stories that further bitcoin. There are posts about the best way of approaching local businesses about adopting bitcoin and rewards are offered to people who do this evangelizing.
I don't see that as an inherently negative thing. On the contrary, I think it's probably necessary element to the creation/modification of patrimonial power (which money certainly is). I also didn't want to call it a pyramid scheme, because those imply that the underlying product doesn't have value. 
But multilevel marketing is basically a legal pyramid scheme and I think that bitcoin qualifies. The earliest adoptors are at the top- their return is directly related by how many people they convince to participate in bitcoin and by how many people those people convince in turn. There have been cycles of news hype that have brought in new adherents at higher and higher prices. The new users brought in by each wave can be thought of as lower tiers in the scheme, because, while they benefit from new users (through a corresponding increase in the price of BTC), their holdings of bitcoins are limited compared to the early adoptors.
I'm sure some would quibble over the details of this, but MLM isn't exactly a technical term. This explanation covers the motives of both speculators AND evangilists.

Even though there's a lot of reciprocity, I think there are really good reasons to think that when it comes to prosperity that politics is the causal variable… 
Bitcoin is alluring to me. I've had some daydreams: what if all these early adopters pooled some of their proceeds into a fund that used increases in Bitcoin's value to create a sort of private campaign-finance system, for instance? But then I come on r/bitcoin and it's very individual-oriented and rabidly anti-government. Like I said- I don't know what to think.

It seems like one of the main purposes is to circumvent government authority. I know that this time last year a (now former) friend of mine in NYC was hired to use the bitcoin network to help a sleazy businessman avoid taxes. A lot of the early hype was (and still continues to be) over the blow this could strike against fiat currency.
I don't care for that. I think that cumpolsory taxes are necessary to provide crucial public goods. I'm also a Keynsian and believe the government has a duty to influence the economy to keep it from growing too fast and to guard it against violent crashes.

Okay: Where do you live? How many times has your life been threatened by a bandit?
You bring up war to attack the usefulness of states in reducing violence. I'll admit that I simplified my statement, just like you simplified yours ("*nearly* every war"? I guess the Crusades don't count. Also- why make the distinction about the "Western world"? Is it because violence and war is much more of a problem in areas with weak states, like modern-day Africa??). But let's get back to bitcoin for a second:
If we put aside the absurd question of "has the invention of the state improved people's lives," (which might as well be rephrased as "is society valuable?"- a question that seems to be the logical end of this uber-individualism, libertarian faith) and return to currency… what caused World War 2? The Great Depression. Economically desperate people are often driven to war. But post-World War 2, we've seen a remarkably few number of wars, compared to before.
What changed? Well, a lot of things. One of them is the extent to which central banks managed the global economy, to take out those peaks and depths of laissez-faire. Another was the abolition of the gold standard, which had caused much volatility and lesser depressions in the late 19th, early 20th century. If you accept the very basic premise thateconomic factors are one of the key variables in international conflict, then perhaps you should be very cautious about an overly glib attitude towards the decentralization of currency control.
Now, there were other factors, of course. The increase in the number of democratic states (no two democratic states have ever gone to war with one another). The rise of liberal international institutions and norms. These are the things that should inspire attempts to use technology to improve currency, which I think is a good idea. I have a very open mind- but the Ayn Rand nonsense I've encountered since I started browsing r/bitcoin makes me doubt whether this community is ready to take on the task.
@_date: 2014-04-07 10:50:41
This is what I find so fascinating about the Bitcoin community. You find lots of people mentioning the 99% etc., but a fixed, deflationary currency is an extremely conservative policy. Someone like Friedrich Hayek would say that there's no way to use monetary controls to smooth out the business cycle and help workers, but he would be making a very technical point that I don't think most people here understand (I'm sure there are some of course... I'm not saying I understand it fully myself). People here boil it down to an ideological point-of-view, that markets always provide the best outcome and that's not really it (nor is it true).
Anyway, yes, money will tend to flow to money. But it's not true that efforts to 'move a bit around' always move it from bottom to top. Economic policy during the Great Depression and post-WW2 show that's not that case. And for all the talk about inflation being the greatest theft, realize there's a reason conservative parties tend to be inflaiton-hawks and liberal parties are more willing to allow its increase.
On the other hand, everyone should hate deflation. Hayek certainly said it should be avoided...

There's no beatings (although with Bitcoin's low transaction costs perhaps you could create an efficent, distributed beatings-market!)- you don't need beatings when you have debt. Here's a few potential uses though:
Scenario 
**Person A:** Wow, I don't make enough money with my job to feed my family/provide a home for them to live in. Can I borrow some of your money?
**Person B:** I, like all rich people now, only loan out Bitcoins. Do you want those?
**Person A:** Guess I don't have a choice...
*Years later....*
**Person B:** Time to pay up!
**Person A:** Uh, I'm really sorry about this, but Bitcoins are worth more than they used to be. I'm finding it hard to save up enough to pay you back, due in no-small-part to my lower wages (See Scenario  Can I pay you a bit less or extend the loan?
**Person B:** I didn't realize I was dealing with a no-good "taker." Obviously you're either lazy or stupid, if the almighty free-market has deemed you unworthy. However, I'm not without a heart, I'll agree to let you [take more debt; move onto my land and work for me; sell me your spare kidney; etc., etc.]
Scenario 
**Person A:** I don't have money to feed/house my family; can I have a job?
**Person B:** Ever since I and the rest of the rich have forced the world to adopt Bitcoin, we have discounted the potential return on our investments against the predictable rise in Bitcoin's value. We therefore have less demand for labor; a very predictable result of deflation.
**Person A:** But I'll work very hard and very efficently, I swear I can make you more money than if you were to save your money!
**Person B:** PERHAPS! I will take a chance on you, but because of the high supply and low demand of labor, I can only pay you very little.
**Person A:** Well, I guess I don't really have a choice...
**Person B:** Don't worry, there's always Scenario  And thanks to Bitcoin, lending markets are more efficent than ever!!
**Person A:** THANK YOU BITCOIN!!!!

People are really blowing the importance of fiat currencies out of hand. Governments operated fine when everyone was on the gold standard (although, admittedly the frequent depressions that came along with it made people pretty restless). Governments can even practice Keynesian economics without monetary control, not that Bitcoin's success necessarily means a total defeat of state-backed money.
That said, the history of Bitcoin makes it plain that it *is* ideological. Take a look at the discussions from the cypherpunk mailing list. The people who designed Bitcoin and yearned for its creation were decidedly anti-state.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:17:13
No- all three of those crimes can be committed to help yourself or someone else.
And of course you can perjure yourself or be the subject of a subpoena in your own trial- you just can't be forced to testify against yourself. 
You're insisting that the harm principle should be strictly applied in lawmaking. But there are crimes where it's not a specific individual being harmed, but society in general. Such is the case when the rule of law is obstructed.

The US didn't "find" Bitcoin to be a terrorist threat- there's no law or proclamation. The Department of Defense is studying it. They study lots of things.

If you think we still practice Keynesianism, I don't think you know what the word means. [This man is not a Keynesian.]( The huge pro-cyclical spending of Reagan and George W Bush was not in line with Keynes.

Politics is a problem of collective action. Bitcoin is also a problem of collective action, which it has overcome thus far by paying people to mine and speculate. Some of the people who are rich in bitcoins should have some long-term vision and institute their own campaign finance plan or pay people to do campaign work.

That's right- they can't. It's called a collective action problem- a problem governments are in a unique position to solve (because taxes are mandatory and coercive). Not that governments can't have collective action problems of their own, but isn't it funny that if Bitcoin succeeds and makes it "to the moon," government will have beaten it there by 60+ years?

Government regulation made it possible for small businesses to compete with bigger businesses- the states that began deregulating first (it was a state movement that was adopted by the federal government) [were those with fewer small banks]( Small banks were protected by the restrictions on branching and acquisitions. 
You could have a similar graph showing the consolidation of media companies- a result of the same political trend- and there's less certification and licensing involved in that industry (obviously there are some in radio and television broadcasting, but the first amendment means anyone can start a newspaper, record company, or movie studio). 
Government-backed currency wasn't the reason for the consolidation of wealth and capital in the first gilded age and it's not the reason for its consolidation today.

That law gives the Treasury Secretary the power to promulgate regulations to carry out his duties, as well as the power to delegate that power to subordinates. One of the Secretary's duties is to "take steps to discover fraud and attempted fraud involving receipts and decide on ways to prevent and detect fraud" (amongst other things).
The Secretary invoked this power to create FinCEN. So yes, Congress voted on this.

I'm not a troll, but I've had many disagreement with users on r/bitcoin. I own .1 BTC and am interested in the technology, but I believe in democracy and that government is good for society- and so is Keynsian economics.
I also don't hate Bitcoin. But I think its growth has been predicated on it usefulness in skirting government regulation and speculation- speculation fueled at times by the debt of users. And it's based on this idea that there's no problem a free market can't solve, which I think is wrong.
Currencies are traditionally backed by the power of states. Bitcoin's backed by the idea that someone wishing to manipulate the system can't obtain 51% of the network's computing power. I think it's sad that people here are so much more willing to trust the latter than the former, though I understand it. I think it's a commentary on the poor performance of governments in the past several decades, but I don't think it's really the future of money and economic activity.

If you legitimately care about changing politics to eliminate the use of violence to enforce economic order, then I applaud you. That's what I'm interested in- both domestically in the US and internationally. That's what my line of questioning here has been about- trying to discuss how that can be accomplished. I don't think "letting the crypto currency cat out of the bag" is a solution by itself. I'd very much like to have that discussion. But none of this nonsense of opposing the state for the sake of opposing the state. That's why people outside of Reddit don't like Jullian Assange; it's why they don't like Ron Paul. Because they have the political ideology of 14 year old boys, who think that the good neighborliness of the racially segregated, middle class suburbs they grew-up/live-in is indicative of how people act in a state of anarchy.

You realize that government is a natural human phenomenon, right? Wars happen because of government only insomuch as wars require the cooperation of a lot of people and the only way you can get that cooperation is through government. That's because taxation is a really effective way to overcome problems of collective action (the free rider dilemma).
So I'm going to go ahead and ask you to identify this time "before government".

I suggest you read over [Mancur Olson's "The Logic of Collective Action"]( These are things that benefit everybody, but it's irrational for any one individual to choose to group with others to provide them. That's why any collective actions that seek to provide public goods need to provide inducement or coercion other than the public good to its members.
Government provides public goods with tax money, which it generates through taxes, which aren't optional. Otherwise a lot of important things in society wouldn't be there.

Um. Okay. How many bitcoins are mined on a daily basis? If you want a bitcoin today, you need to buy it from someone who already has it.
Every person that comes to believe that bitcoins are a good thing and tries to buy one increases the price of bitcoins. Yes, you're right, that's a market. But it's also a social network with a set of beliefs. That's why a lot of people on this sub have all the critical-thinking skills of a cult member: how else do you put a sizable amount of money with so so much volatility?
There's a tech that underlies bitcoin that sounds like it's of some value. But most of the price is speculation based off salesmanship and group think.
Comparing it to a cult is maybe better for discussions sake (I admit I used the phrase 'pyramid scheme' hoping to be provocative and get people arguing against me- but I swear, I'm not trying to troll: I'm trying to understand). In sociology, a cult is simply a new religion. So people here hope that bitcoin lasts and grows pasts the initial cult stage, to become a religion- yes, just like state-backed currency. But realize that it's a matter of belief, and if you want people to buy into it, you need to have an answer for my question: What's in it for society?

1) You're right. Not everyone is able to take part in the current monetary system. This is why I'm on this sub in the first place- I think that's a good goal. But that doesn't seem to be what bitcoin is about.
2) You're also ridiculous. "You support a monetary system that has the power to debase people's hard earned money whenever they feel like it. You support a system where banks and governments can raid people's savings if they see fit." Okay dude. You're right. We should total weaken the social structure that allowed for nearly 100% of the economic prosperity we've experienced thus far, give all our dollars to bitcoin exchanges, and promote news articles praising bitcoin until people see the light. Maybe one glorious day the evil central banks will have their power to "debase" our currency (at the shocking rate of 1-3% per annum!! Omg! How dare they cast stones about the ability to store wealth!) and then there will be nobody to stop the miraculous hand of the market!
My example is a civil war torn place like Somalia, because that's one of the few places poor enough that they can't afford one of the most necessary goods, right after food, clothing, and shelter: a state to protect them. There are few places on earth lucky enough to live in a libertarian society, because no one seems to want to have to protect their own property and live in constant fear. Everyone enjoys having highways and schools and a social safety net.
I'm talking about using central banking to protect the world economy from the kinds of depressions experienced back when the world was on the gold standard and you return with examples of countries not large enough to really have a say in that regulation and two countries in the Eurozone, which got swept away in a credit crisis whose origins were the 2008 financial crisis, created by Ayn Rand devotee Alan Greenspan. Greece, whose situation went from bad to worse when they were forced by Germany to go against conventional Keynsian logic. Not to mention the generally terrible state of individual Eurozone economies, caused by…. oh look! Their inability to manage their own currencies!

I really believe the technology can be used to transform politics, but I can't mention it without people attacking the concept of states.

Why are you interrupting this madman's fantasy with a logical point?
@_date: 2014-01-04 07:19:27
You're assuming that everyone's selfish actions add up to good for society. It doesn't. I suggest you read ["The Logic of Collective Action" by Mancur Olson]( It's pretty often the case that everyone acting rationally and in their own self-interest adds up to results that are suboptimal compared to if everyone cooperated.
Here's an easily explained example, given in the first chapter: imagine a perfectly competitive industry. Every firm has an interest in a higher price. If all the firms agreed not to sell as much as they can, they could raise the price and everyone would end up with more money. But all it takes is one company to undersell the others and they can make a killing. In short: "For these reasons it is now generally understood that if the firms in an industry are maximizing profits, the profits for the industry as a whole will be less than they might otherwise be." The same logic undercuts any collective action that seeks to provide public goods. It takes some outside influence- some inducement or coercion- or a very small group to overcome the dilemma.
The state offers a lot of public goods that we find very useful. Obviously there's safety. There's public schools, clean drinking water, firefighters, etc. etc. It overcomes the problem of collective action by making taxes compulsory.
The way I've come to see it, the whole point of bitcoin is to undermine the state, namely by facilitating tax evasion (I've heard a former developer friend of mine talk about the contract work he's gotten setting up such schemes with bitcoin) and thus this very useful way of providing public goods. It also undermines one of the more important of those public goods, which was provided in the wake of a series of very serious depressions caused by the gold standard, the Great Depression, and World War 2: the use of central banking to curb the harsh highs and lows of free-market economics.
I've been talking with people in this sub for a few days now and I understand that they don't value either government or central banking very much. I think both are done at great peril. I think that the success of filesharing and the pirate symbolism has gone to their heads a bit.
So, to respond to your point: I know that the question of "what's in it for me?" has been driving the growth of bitcoin for months/years now. But the value of bitcoin as a technology hasn't driven its growth: the incentives that I outline in the text of my original post has. This is very much in line with Olson's theory, by the way. And maybe it can pivot from the wild speculation, greed, and illicit activities that have fueled its growth so far over to a useful consumer technology. Or maybe it's like every other pump and dump stock. I don't know.
I think that the people in this sub and Reddit in general have a political ideology very different from the mainstream public. I remember the fervor over Ron Paul in 2008 and the hype over the multimillion dollar money bomb. That'll get everyone's attention, the media will have to cover him, and obviously once everyone hears this message they'll jump on board like we have. Except people don't like the message.
Like I said, the bitcoin community is selling an idea to people. So far it's mainly sold a libertarian fantasy to gold-buggers. There are stories of people believing in it so much that they've leveraged their assets to borrow and 'invest' in bitcoin. That's been useful to grow the market cap. But that supply is limited. The next plan is bill it as "the internet of money" and maybe THAT can get it to grow some. 
But why couldn't part of the pitch be to join a movement that's not just going to revolutionize money, but also finance and government? I started another thread that went nowhere, asking whether bitcoin could revolutionize politics. I was hoping to spark people's imaginations- I offered an idea that early adopters could pool some of their bitcoins (which have skyrocketed in dollar-value) and use the annual increase in the dollar value to help finance low level political campaigns. Make them more competitive. I didn't offer it as a ready-made solution, merely an example of the sort of line of thinking I'm talking about.
I just think that people are discontent and they're ready to be excited about a new technology that has the power to transform society. But I don't think that people on a broad level are going to read the sort of rhetoric that takes place in this sub and come to the conclusion that bitcoin offers that.

I think it's hilarious that so many people here have probably seen the US government as the enemy. When you hear people talk about "them" and "they" around here, they're probably 50% likely to be talking about the US government (I joke), and when you hear someone say "the government," followed by a rant, they're talking about the US government probably 100% of the time (less of a joke).
But capitalism is part of what defines the US and it also helps defines out government (too much, I think, but alas). Yeah, the IRS ruled you have to pay capital gains on your bitcoins... Capital gains in the US is a pittance. Now we have a 6-0 decision on its use in politics.
At the same time, I feel like everyone used to have high hopes for China, but if you had to rank countries and their governments based on their friendliness towards Bitcoin, I think the US would be pretty high on the list, especially compared to China.
I think the flaw in the thinking has been seeing Bitcoin as an antidote to the federal reserve and central banking. It's not- it's virtual money/a virtual asset. The crypto-anarchist notions are a line for a science fiction novel. Plausible? Perhaps, but it's surely only a tiny fraction of potential futures.

Please. She answers his question, saying that she is In charge of overseeing implementation of the board's policies, not the board itself. Then he asks who is responsible, then instead of repeating or clarifying his question when asked, he rephrases it to ask what SHE has done, implying that she should have done something. It's a pretty pitiful excuse for congressional oversight.

1) I'm not saying the US doesn't have a privileged position or that it doesn't have an impact on global wealth disparities.
2) I'm not saying states and central banks can't be mismanaged. I think Alan Greenspan and the 90s dot com bubble/ 2008 crisis is a good example of what can happen when a central bank is mismanaged. 
These are two reasons I think there's room for improvement. But that's what I want to discuss, not the absurd notion that the world would be better if it was more like an Ayn Rand novel.

The Federal Reserve wasn't in existance for the consolidation of the railroaids and the oil companies in the 19th century. There are other economic forces than central bank spending; large banks and large businesses have certain advantages that come with larger amounts of capital.
You point out that the Federal Reserve has inflated assets and that's true. I think it's an argument for a better central bank than for laissez-faire. But they aren't the root cause of consolidation.

Right, but obviously bitcoin is susceptible to sudden rises and falls. It "beating" Berkshire Hathaway in the end doesn't detract from Buffet's point. The guy who wins the lottery isn't a genius for playing; if you win a bet that bitcoin will rising 15% it doesn't mean it's a good investment.

It's not theft, per se. Theft you get nothing in return. With taxes you get safety from anarchy and the bandits/warlords and super shitty life that comes along with it. Yeah taxes compulsory, but it's what's built society. It's definitely not like gang rape. Get real.
@_date: 2014-01-03 03:20:23
Yes. That's what I said. The government has the monopoly on violence. Politics is the struggle to dominate, typically by controlling the government. Democracy is an attempt to have as many people controlling the government as possible.
A good government follows laws that govern that violence. I'd rather have law than anarchy, thank you.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:52:12
While I certainly applaud attempts to improve governance systems (that's what this is- it's not proposing anarchy, rather, large-scale direct democracy), this has a long way to go before it's a credible alternative to representative democracy (for example: how is voting secured? Bitcoin's secured via a proof-of-work method, which isn't very democratic). Also, any attempt to implement it will run into a collective action problem!
@_date: 2014-04-09 22:47:58
Maybe you should investigate the context of the quotes you use, so as not to appear foolish. In that sentence, Keynes was paraphrasing Lenin. 
That work was about the Versailles Treaty, warning that the reparations would lead to runaway inflation and destabilize Germany, leading to political unrest (which of course turned out to be true). It made him famous, but it's before his major contributions to economic theory. It's not necesarilly incompatible with his later advocacy of using state spending to mitigate economic cycles; he never called for a complete debauchment of the currency. 
Anyway, to answer your question, there's a difference between fiscal and monetary policy. Just because government borrowing affects interest rates doesn't make it monetary policy. ALL borrowing affects interest rates.
@_date: 2014-04-09 20:04:38
True. It doesn't preclude causation either.

This is really informative. It seems that the deeper these discussions go, the more obvious it is that libertarian nonsense is motivating this whole thing.
The US is a democratic state- we select our leaders through a process of competitive elections. Now, I don't think it's a perfect state, but it reflects the wishes of those that participate in elections. Instead of trying to create solutions to improve politics (politics being what this community so obviously cares about, given its hostility for empircaleconomics), you're investing your time in a tech whose long term goal is a weakening of the state (whose benefits you've obviously never gone without) and whose short term goal is to get the early adopters rich.
I love the hesitation towards the endorsing human rights. Not to spoil things for you, but you need to pick one: you can either be an atheist or you can believe in human rights. Not that I'm pushing one over the other, but human rights are something people came up with. There's no empirical evidence for them, so they said they're given by God. There are two ways you get things in this world, including rights- you take them or they're given to you. This whole sub seems hell-bent on taking and doesn't even seem to know the meaning of the word "giving".
In this thread and in others I've outlined all of the incredible public goods that the state's given- which is a roundabout way of saying "things that people have given to themselves". The response I've received, you would think that personal safety, public health, and education (not to mention computers and the internet) have been burdens you all have been cursed with. Let me tell you what: go down to Somalia. Come back and tell me how you'd rather live in a society where the state doesn't have a monopoly on violence. Go look at some real-life pirates, instead of those ones that help you take all the software and entertainment your hard drive can fit.

Interesting. I don't know what you think about the government, but a lot of people in r/bitcoin would argue that the government is a scheme even though no one person directs it: the rules create a system that benefits the people who made the rules.

They're similar in that they both attempt to replace existing patrimonial power. That's why they both seem weird to outsiders.

No- the collective action problem says that it's illogical for someone to contribute to achieve a public good when that individual contribution has no hope of being the difference between the good being achieved or not. Voting is a great example of a collective action problem.
It follows that the only way collective actions work is if some kind of excludable (as opposed to a public good, which once it's achieved it's impossible to prevent an individual from benefiting) good is offered as a selective incentive or if coercion is used. If you want a more detailed explaination, along with the math to prove this, you can check out Mancur Olson's *Logic of Collective Action*.
So collective actions do happen all the time, but they don't succeed by appealing to the ideals of individuals. AARP offers special insurance rates to members. Ron Paul used to fundraise by offering newsletters on how to invest in gold. On the coercion side, the old ladies in Montgomery would publically shame men who broke the bus boycott, making fun of them ("we're walking and we're old ladies!"). Social ostracization is a powerful motivator (you can see it in the freedom riders as well- liberal college students would be chastized for not acting on their beliefs).
Taxation is coercive. It relies on violence, as opposed to the previous examples. But at the same time, it's usually not especially burdensome in democracies. More importantly, the taxes are used to provide a police force (another public good) and *ensure that nobody else in society is allowed to use violence*. This is pretty valuable, especially if you're keen on trade. It's also used to fund courts to enforce contract, go to the moon, etc.
So I think I've answered your first question. As far as the second, it depends on what the ends and the means are. For the third, no. I believe in democracy. Nobody's elected me to be the wielder of legitimate violence.

What? A government is not a business. Some governments are corporations, yes, but that's besides the point. Having a budget and finances doesn't make something a business.
A government is a government. Its laws are not products that people consume, they are the laws that everyone is obligated to follow. It has similarities to other institutions, but it really doesn't make sense to compare it to anything but a government.

I don't think it's a conspiracy to destroy Bitcoin... It's just, there have been a lot of unrealistic assumptions for so long that reality sounds like a conspiracy to true believers. 
In reality, this company was selling Bitcoin futures and didn't register/conform to laws regarding futures contracts. The agency reached a ruling on a case that came before it... If you think the director of the CFTC was pulling into the Oval Office to be given the secret plan to destroy Bitcoin, you may be inflating the importance of Bitcoin to the federal government.

Seriously- a chain is only as strong as its weakest link. You can have a decentralized ledger that's solved the double-spend problem and it doesn't mean anything more than that.

Mr_E is making the same mistake as all people who believe Bitcoin will replace fiat currencies: government-backed currency exists because the government enforces contracts. Normally, you and I make a contract and if you break it, then I can sue you in court. But that's 'centralized', which is bad apparently. In truth, there's no way to have a decentralized way to enforce contracts- there will always be some authority, otherwise people with conflicts will just gun each other down. 
M_E is talking about having a network protocol that allows people to trade contracts with one another, which is basically what bitcoin is, but presumably with more bells-and-whistles. But it just introduces a second-order problem of who enforces the original contracts. Again, it has to be some type of centralized entity.
The main feature of the modern state is that it has the 'legitimate monopoly on violence'. It's a pretty decent bargain for society- particularly when control of the state can be contested in elections. But some people think the internet changes everything. That's why Bitcoin got to $1,200.

There may very well be legal arguments against it, but I don't think that's the best one. Bitcoins are sold all the time- the price at which you can sell the coins at the time of the donation is the value for campaign finance purposes. 
More generally, just because someone may come along and make an argument against it shouldn't be a reason not to try/ investigate. You would want a campaign finance lawyer's input- but if you conform to all the known laws, the worst that happens is a judge rules that you can't do it.
I don't know if you're aware, but there are loopholes in campaign finance laws big enough to drive a truck through. If Karl Rove takes advantage of them, so should the people!

Because he's a man that knows the game of politics better than your average techie. If you want to change the political system, doing it through elections is better than hoping for some kind of revolution- violent or otherwise. Elections are governed by rules that are at times ambiguous. So if there's one way of answering a question that increases your political power, you should choose the interpretation that benefits you and leave the nay-saying to your enemies. 
It should probably be the lowest price offered, to maximize the value going to the candidate.

I think bitcoin has a lot of potential, but it's a pyramid scheme- just like any other social construct. Just like the dollar, just like the government, just like religion... It works because people believe in it. The question is whether it's a cult that dies out or whether it has staying power. The refutation of monetary policy in this thread points to cult, but I'm optimistic.

How reliable is that though? What's to say something better doesn't come along before it gets to that point? And what about in the meantime?
If you aren't 100% sure (or sure enough that it's essentially 100%) that your money won't be halved by the time you wake up in the morning, that's not reliable. That doesn't mean it doesn't have potential, but you're arguing with a Nobel prizewinning economist about a very basic definition of currency. 
Did he use hyperbole? Yes- and people shouldn't get so upset about it. This isn't the first time he's commented on bitcoin- he's admitted that he's not entirely sure about the technological underpinnings. But he knows what economists are referring to when they say "reliable store of value".

No- contributions are limited by law by their dollar amount. A method of valuing bitcoins that takes the lowest dollar value means a larger amount of bitcoins can be given to the campaign. 
Also, political contributions aren't tax deductible. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 14:53:02
I wouldn't be too sure. I'm not an expert on federal campaign law, but I'm familiar with the laws governing contributions in New York State. You're allowed to make "in-kind" donations so long as their value is less than the maximum limit. Calculating the value of an in-kind bitcoin donation is easy. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 15:21:23
When people buy things with bitcoins, it's not dispersed: it's rooted in the geography of the buyer and seller. In the US you can donate to campaigns taking place in other states. So yeah, there's a limitation compared to the global ecommerce that bitcoin may traditionally be used for (if that's how people usually spend then), but it's not a considerable limitation. 
And yeah, it WOULD be more dispersed. That's the point- people currently spend too much time/money on "top of the ticket" races like President and Senate, when in reality important political decisions are made in state legislatures and even lower levels of government. Like you said- all politics is local- people who care about changing politics should aim to have wide, dispersed impacts.

I don't think so. Assuming he sees utility in being a donor, that utility (however he defines it) is tied to the political impact of his donation. The political impact is greater if you use the lowest value.
