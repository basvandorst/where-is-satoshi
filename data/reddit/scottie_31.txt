I've been buying more each pay purely because the end is near for fiat. This ponzi scheme the fed and Central Banks are running is an absolute joke and the fact that trump doesn't even tweet a dam word about it proves he's apart of it in some way. 
Time to make the shift before this shitstorm comes crashing down and everyone gets rekt

I am pretty sure this is a load of shit.

Hmm I wonder if this scare tactic will work... Obviously the only reason they're now sending a second letter is because they can't do shit

18mil mined but 5mil roughly lost plus satoshis 1mil stash which I'd say will never go into circulation so 6mil gone. This shits scarce af

No it's not. It's what is drilled into everyone's heads. It's actually one of the worst if you DYOR. Investment property is far better. You have another income plus the taxes you can get back each year etc. If you look at most big guys like grant Cardone, they don't live in the house they own.
Houses are meant for the banks

Fair call but owning a house to live in is one of the worst investments you can ever make. Spoken by grant Cardone himself

I'm more curious why you're sending Crypto to your bank. Fiat is fake af

or lose your job and cant afford payments or if the banks pump up interest rates next year when the recession hits and wages don't increase leaving people stranded in debt to the point where they sell their house at a loss lol. I guess if you bought at a good time like during the upcoming global depression next year it would be good but if you were to buy today or even last year, I really feel bad for those people

Well, when you read shit from the fed giving banks billions to bail them out and an economy that's one massive bubble waiting to pop, you'd be excited holding bitcoin too
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:36:13
That could be a possibility

See I can understand panic sellers and FOMO blah blah but, what I don't understand is how nearly ALL alts bleed when btc drops. 
You can't seriously believe that people are panic selling from all the alts because btc is dropping? 
Why would people panic sell a good coin such as neo or ven just because they see btc drop plus at the same time, people with fucktoken or titticoin do the same?
Imo this is organised and it's a full out bleed run by big players. Lots of bots organised to sell off at a certain day or point. Probably the exact same people who made btc drop back to 6k and then lifted it back up again. 
It's called profit and knowing how the market works. It's unregulated so these guys can play it and are making millions

TBH if they throw cash at bitcoin or altcoins and can actually hold their emotions and wait a few year or more, then those ppl more than likely will be rich
@_date: 2019-09-27 05:09:49
I don't gamble, I just crypto

You know, back in the day when buffet used to invest 10-20% into stocks each pay, I bet ppl said the same thing to him. 
Crypto might have a rather small community ATM but the truth is, it is only getting larger and with the economy crisis and the whole "the US economy is booming" from trumps mouth yet the banks are being bailed out by the fed from any amount over 75mil a day with no cap (could be billions), I'd be buying bitcoin and precious metals. Best thing to do ATM is bet against the dollar. 
Good luck

Yup that's why trends are never used in any market �� ��
