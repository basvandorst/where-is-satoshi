Nice! Good to see we are getting adoption in all manner of industries.
Would be cool if you could get a premium tacked on to the selling price if you sell in BTC.
Also depends on the liquidity needs of your seller.
But seems like a great opportunity for someone to go long BTC at a technical bottom.

The Lightning Network (LN) is basically a way back in for banks to set themselves up again as middlemen earning microfees.
People say, “Yeah! Bitcoin is fast and cheap again.” But they don’t realize the backstory of the insidious LN plot.
Maybe we are just too stupid for bitcoin.

How’s CNY liquidity now?

Wow, real nice guy.
So I take it that I’m right? LN is a sham.

I never saw any volume on Bisq so I deleted it. Any one ever successfully acquired some coin this way?

Like I said, I had it. I couldn’t find a trading partner for days. I guess because I don’t have euro?
LBC was just way better in terms of options.
I understand the idea but I’m afraid it’s just a “field of dreams” where the people just won’t come.

Link? I would love to see a cogent counterargument. The criticism seems pretty rock solid to me. Established moneyed interests centralize a decentralized network. It’s an age old story.
And no, I’m not a bcash shill. That solution has its own issues, primarily the overcentralization of hash power.

Wow, this actually makes a lot of sense. smdh
