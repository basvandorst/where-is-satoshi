Right because technology invented from an earlier time has never been used in current forms of technology. I hate posting ad hominem, but you’re a fucking idiot. 
Its 2018, why do you still own wheels? 
Why are we still using blockchain, that idea is soooo late 90’s!!

Well jews actually do dominate the financial and banking institutions we distrust so much....idk how you can construe this as racist. Sad you can’t see the truth.

Nice ad hominem insult. Doesnt change the fact that neary all international banking institutions have a jewish CEO and mostly jewish C level executives. In China this isn’t even meant to be an insult, its meant as a compliment to Jewish cleverness and accomplishment. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 21:29:12
Exactly haha. At least then you get something in return.

And I’m sure they’ve never misconstrued or manipulated something he did or said to try to sway public opinion right? Like trying to pretend he inappropriately fed the koi pond in Japan? They interpret everything for you and they’re always correct. 
Stop living in the terrifying world in your head. Realize that maybe Trump isnt a racist. I don’t know any racists personally but I dont think they’d date a black woman for two years like Trump did with Kara Young (who has said she doesn’t believe he is a racist). Which I’m sure you’ll make an excuse as to why her opinion doesn’t matter. Meaning you don’t value the opinion of women of color. In which case you are the same exact thing you believe The President to be.

They dont have the same access as rich people. In order to day trade stocks you need to have at least $25,000 in your account. That’s quite the minimum. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 14:06:39
 Idk what point you’re trying to make, their economy was not 100% focused on war was what I was arguing against, which neither points you presented support. 
If anything you reinforced my point because Germany did not start rearming until 3 years before the war (I said “a year or two”) 
Edit: btw “are you serious” is a great tell for cognitive dissonance :)

Why is Germany the only country where its okay to use a slang term to refer to them? Nazi is not a word. Their economic policy was mostly about funding new German families and ensuring work programs and a healthy citizenry, arming Germany was not a major focus until a year or two before the war. A complete lie to suggest it was 100% focused on war. I could see the argument that spending 40% of their GDP on a war was a ludicrous and irresponsible thing to do. Except that was done by America. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 15:24:49
Nazi is a slang term. Its neither German nor English. And neither is whatever weeaboo term you tried to use there.

But what about tax rates?
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:31:49
So if the German miracle was actually the Weimer’s doing, does that mean the prostitution and the 1/3 unemployment were actually Hitlers doing?
Hitler created one of the first PoW national currencies and attempted to overthrow the banking cartels control of his country. Hitler was trying to save Germany and succeeded, before the war. Not acknowledging this fact is revisionist history. 
Edit: also I would love to hear you say the same thing about refugees in Europe today. They can always go back to idk, the middle east ��

Gemini has no iOS app and robinhood doesnt have trading, never heard of the other two. Do they have iOS apps?
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:01:58
I just got my shift card finally after months, the app has bad reviews up the ass but I think it’s because they didn’t realize you could call the number to activate their card. Have yet to use it for transactions 
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:27:28
Paid for another shapeshift card after never receiving the first. Requested tracking for the new card, they did not provide. Never received second card. Lost faith in this idea. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:56:07
I figured GDAX doesnt have an app so coinbase can continue raping normies for transfer fees haha. But yeah I’m waiting for Robinhood I think, used for for stocks since the beta so it’s awesome to seem them start dipping into crypto.
