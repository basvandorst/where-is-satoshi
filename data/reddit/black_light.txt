Cheers, just made a couple of comments. There’s definitely a lot of misinformation flying around in here, that 10k limit for personal use assets seems to get taken out of context a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:32:25
That is definitely not the case. The $10000 limit applies only to assets that are held as, and used as a personal use asset (I.e used to buy goods or services, excluding other assets). Assets that are held as an investment or speculative investment are subject to CGT in their entirety.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:15:47
It does yes. 
Despite what people will tell you, especially the ones spreading misinformation about the 10k limit; the ONLY way to dodge CGT is to spend your crypto as a **personal use asset**.  Crypto that is held for the purpose of making profit is not a personal use asset and it subject to CGT in its entirety.

Yes absolutely, the ATO have released some tax determinations regarding bitcoin as a personal use asset, I’ll dig the links up when I’m at home.
As for your mining rig scenario, the ATO define a personal use asset as an asset that is primarily used for for personal consumption, recreation, or enjoyment. I do not believe buying a mining rig would qualify, as you intend to use it to generate profit. A true personal use scenario would be something like buying a coffee, or a JetSki. So you would have to pay CGT on the rig transaction as it would instead qualify as a barter arrangement. That being said, you would be able to claim the cost of the miner as an expense for any CGT generated from it.
As for buying things, whether or not your crypto holdings qualify as a personal use asset is not dependant on your portfolio as a whole, so just because you bought a coffee once using BTC does not exempt you from paying CGT on the rest of your portfolio. The bottom line is that the ATO do not consider crypto as a currency, which makes legitimate personal use cases few and far between.

Yes, I think we're on the same page now.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:27:16
You are not doing the right thing. Show me the relevant ATO documentation that supports your claim.
Also, read my comment here:
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:33:24
Read the edit to my last post. All the proof you need is there. Including the relevant sections from the ATO tax determination regarding crypto currency.
Also, if you weren't taxed on your crypto profits then you didn't fill in your tax return correctly. Simple as that.

Poli payments have been frozen and/or reversed, this is known. It’s not some great banking conspiracy to restrict crypto trading. More likely a problem with that particular payment method.
I have not see or heard any evidence that banks themselves are freezing or refunding other methods, like bpay.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:38:59
If you are indeed using your crypto as a personal use asset, and that use case matches the ATO definition for a personal use asset, and those transactions are &lt; $10000 then yes, you do not need to pay CGT. 
I am refering to your statements where you say:


Which is unequivocally incorrect.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:11:38
You need to calculate the profit from that particular transaction. Every asset has an initial cost base, so you need to calculate the cost base for the fraction of a bitcoin you sold, subtract it from the sale revenue, and declare the rest as profit. This is the same scenario that stock traders must follow when disposing parcels of shares.
The ATO do not care about your net position to determine profit, only the profit or loss made from individual trades.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:07:18
Absolutely, you’ll just need to show evidence to support the kWh used and claimed. So don’t go claiming your full electricity bill or anything like that, and make sure to keep records.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:02:42
My understanding of this ruling is that you are still liable for GGT, just not for years prior 1 July 2014; provided that you have been genuinely attempting to pay CGT from 2014 until now. 
They’re basically saying that you won’t be fined for not having paid tax  for any profits made prior to 2014 provided that you have been following all the rules from that point onwards.
So if you bought an asset prior to 2014 and sold it today, then you’ll still be liable to pay CGT on 50% of the profit (including the discount).
Could be wrong about that though, best talk to an accountant.
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:18:28
You are absolutely correct.

Yes, there's a port of the script for PowerShell.

 No it doesn’t.
Eidt: Why the hell are people still upvoting this idiot. Look at the title of OPs post for godsake. It has BCH in it and it wasn't removed. [Oh, and here's another slew of posts]( with BCH in the title that weren't removed.
He lied about his post being removed and [he lied about people laughing at him]( in his post on If his post on was removed, it's not for the reason he claims. He's playing the victim for Karma and you're eating it up.
@_date: 2017-11-06 00:50:18
Nah bro, it won't pop until **I** buy one. So you've probably got a few weeks of growth left.
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:26:32
Well he’s not telling the truth about the post on r/btc so it wouldn’t surprise me. The post he made is still there and not a single comment is ‘laughing’ at him. Dude is full of shit.

Nothing has changed. It happened before so it can happen again. Scaling is still a very real problem for virtually every coin.

Except it’s not, certain geographic markets are willing to pay more than others. This may simply be due to supply and demand on local exchanges or due to some other reason.
For example; During BTC’s recent ATH, my local exchanges here in Australia were trading BTC, LTC &amp; ETH for a 10-14% premium over most international exchanges, even after adjusting for exchange rates. I made a pretty penny by buying LTC on coinbase and then immediately selling LTC on BTCMarkers (an AU exchange) for roughly 10% profit after fees. This is called [Arbitrage](

There is risk of double spend, but I do not believe it is cost effective to do so for small transactions. Most payment systems will only accept 0-conf transactions for small amounts. You can read about the nature of irreversible transactions and some of the attack vectors here:
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:09:39
Price is on the way up so you get a lot of new money piling in, people excitedly trading, and moving money between exchanges and wallets. Things of that nature. I do not believe FOMO must only apply to transactions that happen in a short period of time, but it’s really just an argument of semantics at that point.
@_date: 2018-02-28 11:20:56
Nice, glad to see it finally gaining some traction. It's been a while but this is good progress.
@_date: 2019-01-14 06:52:47
The bottom line is that these POS payment processors will usually use 0-conf. They will accept the transaction as soon as they see it broadcast to the network, but before it has actually been mined into a block.
@_date: 2018-02-20 13:25:45
If I were a betting man then I would wager that the drop in transaction volume is due to a decline in FOMO transactions that were happening as the price rose sharply during that 6 month period. A decline in transaction volume is a typical symptom of a bull market turning bearish, at least to some extent.

Speedtest.net rounds down to the nearest whole number, your actual latency will be a fraction (&lt;1ms), but definitely not 0. That's physically impossible. 
It would also be testing a connection to servers that are relatively 'close' to you on the internet (presumably within your carrier's network). Unfortunately your low latency to your carrier means absolutely squat once your connection leaves their network.
But that's still an awesome connection!
