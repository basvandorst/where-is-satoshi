He gets lost a little but this is correct analogy of Bitcoin.  People say miners won't centralized but if you want any sort of transaction through put without chances of missing the blockreward, pools are necessitated.

They only did it after an outcry that was shaking investor confidence and even then it is not even provable if they actually did it.

Bitcoin has the worst type of inflation.  Inflation where the created money is burned off into a process that could be done far more cheaply so it is effectively wasted.  Think open market solutions here.  It appears Bitshares has it.

The problem is that BTC will burn fossil fuels at a level proportional to the price of the coin.  It just doesn't scale in an elegant way, just a simple way.

All technology advances my friend.  All technology.

You are an idiot.  Xeroc is widely and publicly known and has even cut down on the level of free money he takes in off his delegates.  In addition he has spent 100s of hours being helpful in general.  He has done nothing to put himself in a scam position except to genuinely try to donate money.  You on the other hand are most likely a horrible person all around.  Good luck @ enjoying life.

This is possible but would require a serious attack to pull off the social element.  The malicious delegates would be voted out.  If an attacker managed to do enough damage, community consensus could form and their damage could be forked out.  The nuclear button option is always there for 51% type attacks.  Sounds bad, but it protects interests.

I said proportional. Not equal.  The inflation + fee is still proportional to the value of bitcoin.

Miners are not people investing, working and building the real economy.  They are people who had capital to buy miners and now split that cost and electricity to hopefully make a profit.  Miners can be a lot of things, but there is no reason to think they are more interested in their network than anyone in a DPOS ecosystem.  Look at how everyone mined on those huge pools !
@_date: 2014-09-18 23:05:18
Do not for a second think that Bitcoin does not have a human element.  Where they mine is where they vote.  Look at the 0% fee game run by mining pools.  Sketchy.  What is "in theory" when it clearly is not true ?

The problem is volatility.  My bitcoins were worth a lot more a few weeks ago.  A lot more.  What a shame.  I still love bitcoin though.
@_date: 2014-09-20 00:29:29
Which is what the uneducated world talks like when they refer to Bitcoin.  That always annoyed me.  "ponzi" "scam" etc.
@_date: 2014-11-26 20:33:29
blockchain is bitcoin technology.
@_date: 2014-10-20 16:53:10
Just buy the BTC however is easiest.  You might consider putting it into bitUSD given how volatile BTC is.  Either way works.
@_date: 2014-12-25 23:47:14
There may be pumpers but I would be surprised if any of them are not longterm holders and believers.  If you want to pump and dump to make $$$ you don't choose such a large market cap coin.
BTW Nothing-at-stake has been shown to not be valid against DPOS.  It is true however that Bitcoiners spend endless effort trying to denigrate any related technology outside Bitcoin.  :(  Merry Christmas !!

This is quite interesting.  I love this, betting while investing in your favorite artist if I understand the concept correctly.

Bitreserve is run by Halsey Minor.  Google him to see your counterparty risk.  Not sure what you're babbling on about bitshares for as it virtually eliminates counterparty risk and has nothing to do with Mr Minor's business.
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:06:12
Currently there is only 1 truly decentralized counterparty risk free exchange that deals in a USD derivative and that is BitShares. Anything with real USD will have to be centralized and  contain counterparty risk.
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:50:21
So Bitshares is now buying up crypto talent from the space?  meh.
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:42:35
What on earth is whack-a-mole style security patching?
@_date: 2015-01-11 21:07:35
Unless the exchange is verified by strong cryptography like Open Exchange or of course BTS' exchange.  Regulation doesn't prevent theft by claiming hack. :(

I had 32 BTC on bitstamp. I will be so upset if they're lost. I will have to strongly reconsider what technology I wish to support in the future.
@_date: 2015-02-10 09:31:35
 is an LOL thread about this guy.  Complete with how Halsey Minor valuates his company and his tax delinquncies while being counter-party risk etc.  
@_date: 2015-02-16 19:33:28
Just a theory, not a conspiracy.
