They have to set up exchange rates disadvantageous to you or else they will wind up paying off people who discover arbitrage opportunities.
Another way to look at it is that there is no such thing as an "official" exchange rate.  There are only prices offered by various entities at which you can buy and sell USD and CAD for each other.  Analysis of published exchange rates are interesting to see what the market is doing, but they are not binding conversion ratios.  There will always be a bid-ask spread for currency conversions.

@_date: 2014-06-18 02:14:03
To mine, you need to put together a valid and current bitcoin header block ( ) which includes a transaction giving the mining award to an address you control, and find nonces that result in the double SHA256 hash of your header block being lower than the current target (which currently is 0x00000000000000005D859A000000000000000000000000000000000000000000, see  ).  Any given nonce currently has probability of about 6 \* 16^(-17) or 1 in 4.9 \* 10^19 of being low enough.  
Right now the only known way to do this is to generate a bunch of nonces and brute force it.  To attack this in a more efficient way you would need to learn how to subvert a strong cryptographic hash.

I don't think tax law is interpreted all that differently.  The IRS does its own evaluations of the facts, and if they decide your 501c(3) personal charity is actually a way to funnel income to yourself, they're going to treat it that way and bill you for the unpaid income tax.  I don't think their prosecutorial behavior is bound as tightly to law as I think you think it is.  They only have to deal with a "real" court system when they're aiming for a criminal conviction.
If a strange woman comes up to my hotel room, we have sex, then I buy a cigarette from her for $300, that will be an open and shut case for prostitution, even though otherwise I could buy a cigarette from her for $300 (but then she could run into tax problems if she doesn't report the windfall correctly...).  Likewise, trading sex for forgiveness of a debt is also prosecutable as prostitution.

Say you negligently damage somebody's car and a court says you have to compensate the car's owner for their loss.  
If you try to compensate the victim with your stamp collection or another car or Deutschmarks, the victim just might agree to that.  But they always have the option to say "no, you need to compensate me in USD".  In the US, USD is legal tender.  
Likewise, they might have an eye on your nicer car and say "I want you to compensate me by giving me your car" but you can say back to them "No, you're getting USD, and you can't complain since USD are legal tender."
That's what "legal tender for all debts, public and private" means.
It's always possible to trade or settle debts in specie other than legal tender if both sides consent (absent laws banning trade, like ivory or cocaine).

You can keey trying for nonces on a header block that is missing newer transactions, but it doesn't gain you anything.  In fact, if you do get a hash below target but with an old set of transactions, another miner with a current set of transactions might also find a target hash, and the peer network would select his in preference to yours.  
The nonce is a 32-bit word in the block header, see  .  
There is also an extraNonce field in the generation transaction that needs to be iterated over, since there only about 4\*10^9 nonces that can be tried in the block header.

It basically breaks down to supply and demand of currencies.  There is a fixed limit to the total amount of bitcoins, so the supply is fixed.  If demand for bitcoin increases, the market value of a bitcoin will increase, so its price relative to other currencies will increase and the amount of goods you can buy with a bitcoin will increase.  At the same time, assuming the total demand for all forms of money is more or less constant, the relative price of other curencies will go down, as demand for them decreases.

Due to the limited entropy (65.23 bits) of a cube permutation, it's not a good idea to derive a key from it.  Successfully searching the keyspace approaches the difficulty of mining a new block, and you can search for multiple addresses at the same time.
Deriving a key from a deck of cards would be a much better idea.  You can shuffle it a few dozen times, using varying methods, and be fairly confident that you have a properly randomized deck.  There are 225.581 bits of entropy in a 52-card permutation, well in excess of the 160-bit range of private key keyspace.  You can duplicate a key deck with no special equipment or audit trail.

Each block contains a bunch of transactions.  It's important to be able to verify that a particular transaction is in the bunch of transactions referred to by a particular block.
One way to manage that is to take all the transactions, put them in a list, hash that list, and store that hash in the block.  If you wanted to check that a transaction is really included in a block, you would have to duplicate all that effort, hashing every single transaction in the block yourself and checking that total hash against the one stored in the block.  That would work, but there is a smarter way to do it.
A Merkle tree works like the list I just described.  It's used to store a bunch of transactions in such a way that a hash can be produced of the whole bunch of transactions.  But instead of having to hash everything as in the case of the list, you can verify a particular transaction is in the tree by doing a few very small hashes instead of one big hash.

I'm not 100% up on this proposal, and IBLTs are new to me, but I think I have a grasp of it. 
The size of the IBLT is chosen based on some kind of stastical estimate of the discrepancies  in the chosen block transactions between different miners.  For instance there might typically be 10000 transactions in a block and 99.9% of the time neighboring nodes idea of the current transaction set differs in fewer than 100 transactions.
The size of the IBLT is chosen based on that 100 transaction difference.  Since this 100 transaction difference is a constant, it's considered O(1).  
It appears that when a node A that has just found a block sends the block header + IBLT to node B, and A included 30 transactions that B didn't know about, since these 30 transactions are less than 100 B will be able to compare its own transaction set with the IBLT and do some IBLT magic to find the contents of the other 30 transactions.
So the size of the IBLT is not proortional to the number of transactions in the block, but instead related to propogation speed and transaction rate.

The overarching purpose is to eliminate the perverse incentives nodes have to exclude transactions.  The longer the new block announcement message is, the longer it takes to be verified and propagate through the network.  A shorter new block announcement, containing fewer transactions, will propagate faster.  If the transaction fees are small enough, this makes it worthwhile for a node to exclude small-fee transactions from consideration when mining.


It's a way to limit the amount of information that needs to be sent out on a new-block announcement.  Currently all transactions are sent out twice:  once when they are initially propogated, and once when sent out as part of the new block announcement.  With this proposal, transactions only need to be sent over the wire once, and the IBLT is used as a kind of forward error correction or parity block.  
There will always be unlikely scenarios where the IBLT magic is inadequate and nodes will have to fall back to sending full-transaction-list transmissions.  If these are sufficiently rare and everybody sends out fixed-size new block announcements, then no one has the perverse incentive to exclude transactions and even transactions with tiny transaction fees will be included in new blocks.

When you post a bitcoin transaction to the network, it contains a message showing the fund transfers like "take 0.702btc from address1, and give 0.3btc to address2 and 0.4btc to address3".  Notice that there is an extra 0.002btc that doesn't get given to a recipient.  This is a fee that gets collected by whoever mines the block containing this transaction.
If you post a transaction with no fee or a fee that is too small, miners will have very little incentive to include your transaction in the next block.  If you include a larger than average fee, your transaction will be very likely to be included in the next block because the miners will want to receive that fee.
Miners receive bitcoin two ways when they mine a block.  They get  the "block reward", which started out at 25BTC and halves periodically.  They also get all the fees associated with the block they mine.  Eventually (about 2024) the block reward will be eliminated, and miners will only receive the fees.  When a miner mines a block, they include an address in it to which all the rewards and fees go.  
When you are attempting to mine a block, it's in your interest to get as many fees as you can per amount of work you perform.  If there are more pending transactions than will fit within a block, you naturally will want to include the ones with larger fees in preference to smaller fees.  You could exclude any transaction you wanted, but you would just be throwing away the chance to get their fees.

When you accept orders to sell bitcoins, just hold onto the bitcoins.

I think of it in terms of stock terminology.  When you deal in stocks you can use market orders or limit orders.  
A limit buy order says something like "I want to buy 10 bitcoins and I don't want to pay more than $650 each".  The limit order is put into the marketplace and sits there until somebody eventually is willing to sell you some bitcoins at the price you're looking for.  It may also never be satisfied, if the price goes up.
A limit sell order says something like "I want to sell 10 bitcoins at no less than $750".  Like a limit buy order, the limit sell order is submitted to the marketplace and sits around until a buyer willing to pay $750 comes along, which potentially might never happen.

No bitcoin trader owns dollars in a Mt. Gox account.  Instead, traders own promises from Mt. Gox that are supposedly redeemable for dollars.  These promises are mislabled as dollars, and Mt. Gox's ability to keep its promises has appeared to dwindle lately, and the value of these promises has dwindled compared to the value of bitcoin.

See [here](  All the current transactions are hashed into 256 bits which are put into the "hasMerkleRoot" field of the header.  A miner repetitively generates a nonce, sticks the nonce in the 640-bit header, hashes the header, and checks the resulting hash against the difficulty requirement.  So the transactions only need to be hashed once for every 2^32 times the header block is hashed.

You could mitigate that by an arbitrary factor with a Bloom filter.  You also could only include wallets with a current balance over a threshold.
Regardless, the expected payoff from mining is probably magnitudes better than the payoff from brute-force searching for private keys.

These tests only detect certain measurable weaknesses.  It's impossible to verify purely from output that no information about the entropy pool is is nefariously leaked out, or that there is no possible pattern to the output.
For instance, the digits of pi pass every randomness test you can throw at them, but their values are 100% deterministic..

Buying a physical token with a private key printed on it doesn't make any sense to me.  
How do you know the guy who printed up the private keys won't just spend it himself in the future?  In order to ensure you have sole access to the bitcoin value on the coin you would need to transfer it to a private key you generated yourself ASAP, which makes the key printed on the coin worthless.

I don't think it will ever happen that small-time consumers will ever receive prepaid shipments of cost-effective hashing tech.
Say you're a reseller of some hashing tech.  You just put together 1000 hashing gizmos.  You can either ship them or use them.
Shipping them costs money.  Using them makes you money.  You can always ship them next week.  So what if some people on some forums whine.
They have the same decision every week, and conditions won't alter that decision until the gizmos become too expensive to run.

Some wifi drivers are reverse-engineered and have open source implementations with no mysterious binary blobs.  
Maybe I'm paranoid, but I'm thinking you might not even be able to trust any wifi, bluetooth, or ethernet hardware.  Chip manufacturers have major capital assets in countries that would seem quite willing to apply pressure to include hardware exploits, and these devices typically have ring-0 dma access to memory.

Look at how they do sales tax enforcement.  They can audit your books.  They can examine records of your nontaxable purchases and compare them with your claimed volume of sales.  
They could also reposition sales and income taxes as a fee-for-service by making consumer protection laws and use of the courts to enforce contracts only applicable in the cases where transactions are made in a government-supervised framework.

They're not going to make bitcoin illegal.  They're going to make any anonymous or untraceable activity with bitcoin illegal.
They want to monitor and have veto power over every financial transaction performed by every person in the world.  If they could get away with outlawing cash they would.

This is idiotic.  If it's running on a smartphone, it's pwned.  
It's completely within the power of a phone company to undetectably monitor every network interaction, log every input event, and duplicate every file on a smartphone.

The only requirement for something to be recognized as currency is that enough people use it as currency.  I know this is circular, but confidence breeds confidence.
Government-based central banks are not required at all.  Banks used to issue their own currency, then eventually governments decided to awards themselves monopolies in currencies so they could manipulate them to their liking.
You certainly could argue that bitcoin without any governmental support will not likely survive as a currency, the same way that a business that doesn't bribe officials in a corrupt country will not likely survive.  But governmental support is not strictly required for bitcoin in general any more than bribes are required for businesses in general.

It seems to me that they just plain see Bitcoin as undermining their business model.  When anyone can transfer money safely over the internet for nearly free by themselves, Paypal disappears.

There's basically 3 ways to lose bitcoin, as far as I can tell.
1.  You lose your private keys.  Forget where you put them, have a disk drive go bad, forget your password, etc.  Like losing paper money in a house fire.
2.  Somebody else ferrets out your private keys and steals your money.  They hack your computer or phone, or find your secret stash of printed out QR-codes, or finally decide to rip off all the people who bought their physical bitcoin tokens.
3.  Somebody attacks the bitcoin infrastructure (through cryptography, forced shutdown/disconnection of most miners, or brute-force hashing volume) and wreaks havoc.
