Gold has unique properties that cannot be emulated by other metals
Bit coin on the other hand has no features unique to it, and can be easily replicated (and altered to what is desired)

"Make sure you don't listen to this guy talk about Bitcoin."
Then why the fuck did you post it here
Its like saying 'Don't think of a pink elephant'
Anyway, the video goes for 46 minutes, and indeed it ends up just being a promotion for a subscription/'special report'

Shifting the goalposts
Both OP and I are obviously talking about Bitcoin, not future altcoins, and its value in particular
Point is that Bitcoin is going down the shitter in terms of value
Also a dilution of cryptocurrencies would effect ALL cryptocurrencies in the same way

Just like Myspace!

'Head start' is an extremely weak argument
Netscape got a head start too!

It is already starting to dilute, but it has only just begun. Its only within the past month or two that the number of altcoins has begun to explode, and we can already see it drawing away from Bitcoin investment (I.e. Dogecoin)
Its ironic you use Diners club as an example, as they would be one of the ones who had the 'head start' in credit cards
Now hardly anybody uses them, and its been that way for yonks

I actually just edited that as you pointed it out
I meant there are no weak hands in the sense used
I'll repost the updated version in a new thread, as this one has been [removed]
