Thanks, do you know if I will be able to transfer the bitcoins I have on mycelium to a hardware wallet?

Did the transaction get cancelled after 16 days or did it go through?

Always remember though that  rule of investing is to not let your emotions dictate your purchasing choices.

It was because gdax crashed for a bit

I use and love TA too but it becomes irrelevant in crypto when good/bad news hits and the cancellation of the fork is massive news. This run will destroy that trend line.

You definitely can’t predict it but if you put some work in, it’s really not that hard to trade these markets, especially since everyone is a genius in a bull market 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:47:57
Well I have about 5k that I use for day trading. Every week I pick 3 coins that have good graphs. Usually see a $200 everyday by trading 1 of the 3 coins each day. And I spend about 20 minutes each morning setting alerts.. so in total I probably spend 15 min per trade

During November - January if you lost money your an idiot

I set buy orders at $3500, if it breaks that base then I will probably buy a lot around $3000-3200
