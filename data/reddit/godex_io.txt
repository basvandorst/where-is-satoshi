@_date: 2019-07-24 22:52:56
Many companies just use a third-party services for kyc verifications, and this adds an additional possible security breach. 
This is one more reason why we don’t do kyc at all.

Thanks for sharing! Also [Godex.io]( should be in the list. That's a completely anonymous exchanger without the need to create an account. A lot of coins that are not on other exchangers. And soon they will launch affiliate with up to .6% return

You can swap btc on godex without registration, and the exchange rate is fixed.
