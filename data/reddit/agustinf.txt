This is the kind of post that people laugh at once another bubble has occurred. Take a look at what people said when it went from $18 to $3. 
I'm not saying a new bubble will happen for sure... But it probably will, we are still very early on the adoption curve

@_date: 2014-12-14 12:19:32
A bursting bubble doesn't mean the end of it all.
It is reasonable to expect longer and longer downtrends after each bubble, as there is more money lost and more people that lost money.... The downward lasts longer if the price is higher because it requires more people and more money than the previous bubble to agree again on an upward trend.

Here's an idea. Make a site where you can pay people to tweet something and you can get paid to tweet. Something like a tweet auction, where you get paid for each follower to which you tweet.
Not possible without bitcoin!

Funny you use the word "mine" to connect these things. Bitcoin is not a pyramid scheme or a marketing crap, it's a new technology to transfer value through the internet. It will change the world just like email did, like it or not.

Right, and spend hours on the phone with some idiot, trying to get him to chargeback the transactions, and then voiding your CC number to avoid new fraud, and then waiting for the new plastic and then paying interest and insurance you never asked for.
You're right, everything is OK now. You sound like someone defending snail mail in 1992

Bitcoin won't fail. It might get cheap, it might get expensive, but it is growing and nothing can stop it. 
@_date: 2014-05-02 22:36:53
No. The idea is to give bitcoin to a group of people that interact with each other. You want to create network effect, not just give away bitcoins to students

I'd say you make a very focused talk on your subject and mention "knowledge about how bitcoin and the blockchain work" as a "clear example of general knowledge" versus some high end knowledge on cryptography as specific. Assuming something as general knowledge is by far the best way to make everybody study it!! I'm sure this is better than giving out bitcoin, which makes it seem less valuable than money, because normally nobody gives out bills
@_date: 2017-02-12 12:26:23
I see this as a bad idea for different reasons than the exposed here by others: kids need education, not money. If you give him that kind of money, he'll be miserable, because you will take away from him the chance to earn a living by himself.

You're right to think I didn't but I did.
The thing is I think giving money to your 30 year old son is still a way to destroy his motivations... It has more to do with the role a parent plays on one's life than to the age of the "kid"

A particularly good way to approach this kind of education is teaching from the ground up, emulating the birth of bitcoin itself, studying the base first, digital signatures, cryptographic hashes, merkle trees, networks, proof of work... Show the ingredients, show how people used to combine them when bitcoin didn't exist (and other centralized digital coins existed and failed). If you teach them the base that Satoshi had when he conceptualized Bitcoin, your students will love you for that and perhaps some of them will be able to discover how Bitcoin works by themselves, almost inventing it again.

I don't find it too convincing. Think about it.
 So let's assume the size of blocks with segwit ends​ up being 4x smaller than without segwit... This is a constant. 4 times is not a lot in the long run... the network capacity should grow exponentially, and dividing it by 4 doesn't make any any real difference
The point is we don't risk missing the scaling goal by 4x, would probably be by 100 or 1000s.

@_date: 2017-06-20 02:52:33
Well it seems not for everyone: 
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:27:59
I agree... but what about "transferal properties"? aren't those more important nowadays?
@_date: 2013-12-26 02:41:01
Miners aren't really solving anything. They're just trying to guess.
Look, try to play the miner yourself manually, go to [this sha256 site]( and try different 'data' until you get a 0 as the first character of the hash.
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:01:02
A few facts to get you thinking:
 * the "mining algorithm" is an invented one, just meant to be hard.
 * nobody holds bitcoins, they hold a key that entitles them to add a valid transaction on the public ledger
 * miners put transactions through the sha256 hash function. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:38:03
Yes, but that value is way under the current price, isn't it? 
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:52:16
Not to my knowledge (I'm chilean and live in Santiago). We're a small bitcoin community here.. I founded  and want to accept bitcoins, but it requires quite an effort to convince restaurants to deliver food and trust we will pay them afterwards.
If you are coming to Santiago and are a Bitcoin fan you might want to come to a meetup:
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:43:41
Well, Australia and New Zealand and very close (both geographically and culturally, right? probably have the same banks..) But could you send money to USA or Russia for instance?  I can transfer money within Chile and it takes a couple of seconds to appear on the other side... but going outside of the country will take 2-3 working days and US$100
@_date: 2013-12-19 11:45:10
I disagree. I see Bitcoin has an intrinsic value which is the ongoing miners network. Even if it was valued at US$0.01, I would want to buy it to transfer money to another country without waiting or having to pay big fees. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:19:53
I see...BTW, how/why can you transfer money instantly with no fees? 
@_date: 2013-12-26 03:19:37
Seems weird they claim to accept credit card.. usually no one is willing to sell BTC using a payment method that enable the user to charge back
@_date: 2013-12-29 04:02:39

@_date: 2013-12-24 12:06:57
Well, banks are specially afraid of money laundering as governments watch their swift/sepa movements closely to avoid it. Stupid bank, as a money launder wouldn't honestly write down "bitcoin" in the transaction comments.
