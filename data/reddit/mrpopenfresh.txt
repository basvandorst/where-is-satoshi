Watching from the outside is pretty entertaining as well.
@_date: 2014-01-31 01:51:35
See, that's why you need someone with an outside view to give a critique on image. is a scary place that is a really big turn off to the whole BTC idea. There's no denying it.

The japanese still use shutter cameras, what a paradox of a country.
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:48:38
Being weirdos like this in si what is putting people off. I can't agree that people are forcing themselves onto bitcoin, because everything I've seen has been quite the opposite.
@_date: 2014-03-28 02:55:26
You meed to talk to your municipal government.
@_date: 2014-03-25 17:15:30
The btc doesn't just dissapear when converted.
@_date: 2014-02-07 22:39:26
Everyone look at this guy, he read the article!
@_date: 2014-01-31 02:43:03
See? This is what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:21:19
The bitcoin community is not a community, but rather an agglomeration of people who only think and care about themselves.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:00:37
Is it 1 million dollars or is it in bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-04 13:51:40
Are you going to adjust the amount of bitcoint o represent the value on that day? I'm just curious as to how many bitcoins make a million, because we all know it can change drastically overnight.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:02:30
You're talking about Sean's outpost, I'm talking about the bitcoin community. It's shit, don't try to deny it because you're only kidding yourself.
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:37:08
How was that money "made" exactly?
@_date: 2014-02-24 15:46:45
You're giving your information to a private entity, not the government.
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:54:57
You're only kidding yourself if you don't think there's a crossover between the two.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:45:22
Please do. I wasn't reffering to the cryptocurrency community, but rather the bitcoin community.
@_date: 2014-03-18 23:35:43
@_date: 2014-10-05 20:20:49
Since they've been trying to get the fuck out.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:39:14
Yeah he.. probably shouldn't have used his real name. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 01:20:59
No we don't.
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:44:56


No it isn't. Your reading comprehension must suck.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:30:53
I'm not invested in bitcoin, I'm just a curious watcher. Stop projecting, it's not productive.
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:16:38
Welcome tot he Internet, where copying and pasting informaiton you know little about is what it runs on!
@_date: 2014-03-09 18:47:56
It's a pretty crummy metaphor. Unclear, long and convoluted.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:58:13
What's the breakdown?
@_date: 2014-03-03 20:20:44
No one can predict huh, that can't be a good thing.
@_date: 2014-03-04 04:03:21
Everytime I check out this sub I'm amazed that it isn't a pro bitcoin circlejerk. Well, not all the time anyways.
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:50:15
Evidence? Just read through the sub to see some other evidence as to how weak the community can be. Either way, I'm done here.
@_date: 2014-01-31 01:50:07
Oh boy, that is simply too rich!
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:26:30
Of course, no one in this thread is part of that ignorant horde!
@_date: 2014-03-06 00:45:27
You're not helping your community by being an asshole. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:40:36
The bitcoin ATM isn't a government entity, dingus.
@_date: 2014-03-03 14:31:37
A non digital camera, judging by the shutter sounds.
@_date: 2014-02-10 23:33:48
If you're going to show and not tell, talking about an internet currency on an internet forum is probably the worst way you could do it.
@_date: 2014-05-07 17:53:53


What's the story behind this?
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:29:51
Compared to dogecoin in every way, this community is terrible.
@_date: 2014-02-24 16:34:26
How is it relevant? If you want to give your information to a private entity go ahead. You can be anonymous with bitcoin online if you like. Blame the company, not the government.
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:47:04
Oh please, as if this would create precedents.
@_date: 2013-12-31 02:32:08
It's this us vs them mentality that makes some people so frustrating.
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:36:37
What do you know about psychology?
@_date: 2013-04-23 13:57:55
I just checked your slides. You guys really need to step it up profesionnally. "All around hacker" is not an interesting way to label yourself when it comes to storing currency, and the Power Puff girls? Why?
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:07:42
Definitely, unless you consider your website (and by extension, your product) informal.
@_date: 2013-12-30 00:30:49
This is really a shit post being upvoted in considering it has nothing to do with bitcoin, and at best is a fallacious attack on Paul Krugman.
