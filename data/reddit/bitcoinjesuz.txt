Go for it, take a little time to hear key influencers out and use your common sense. Remember the most accessible currency may not be the best investment

What a bunch of drivel, you guys should broaden your sources of information, and think for yourselves instead of being told what to feel

This is not correct. They're just listing a token representing a futures contract on the value of potentially separate 1x and 2x chains.

Do you know any rich technical analysis? I don't. Do you know any rich investors. I do. The whole trading approach underlying tech analysis has been disproven in academic studies.  See Malkiel 'a random walk..'.  This applies to fundamental analysis too. However crypto space is not a mature market yet. Look at all the FUD and amateurs and wannabes. So fundamental analysis still  provides a competitive edge for investment decisioning in maturing markets. Go Bitcoin Cash! BCH!

Yo readish making good money today? Blockstream pay for # of posts is too stingy given the good work you are doing

You sir are an ignoramus and a bully. What laws are the 2X folks breaking? By what authority?  This is nothing more than rabble rousing and ego gratification for those without real power or means.
