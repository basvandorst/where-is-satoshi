Huawei merges with Jeff Bezos to form Bezwei. It goes to war with the Illuminati. The Illuminati creates a quantum computer to destroy Bitcoin in an attempt to drain Bezwei of all its power. The plan nearly works, until Bezwei sends a rocket to the sun to create a solar flare, destroying the Illuminati and all life on earth. Bezwei owns the last Bitcoin remaining from the Bezwei-Illuminati wars.

The US dollar is backed by its tenuous relationship with Saudi oil, probably more so than their military might.  The world only needs so many death machines. 
Crypto’s use in Venezuela, who has the largest oil reserves and the increasing pressure in congress to stop giving the Saudis a free pass for everything makes Bitcoin ripe for bullish speculation.

Sure, it’ll get there ��. Most of the private savings is owned by the wealthy just like any other country with income inequality.
