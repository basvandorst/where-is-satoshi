Buy from Zebpay and then transfer the coins to Trezor or Nano Ledger S. Alternatively, if you can’t get any of these hardware wallets sooner, you can transfer your coins from Zebpay to Kraken.com. In both the cases, you’ll get both btc and b2x.

You're mistaken if you believe that the Chairman of the largest bank in the United States doesn't understand what Decentralized means. The only reason why he's saying this is because he is scared &amp; knows Bitcoin and Blockchain in general are disrupting banking and are going to make a huge dent to his business.

“The difference in prices between exchanges is less when volatility is low. “ Im quoting this from zebpay’s official blog post. Right now prices are hovering around 8.5k. Nothing too crazy going on as there’s no major news in the global market.

I wont settle for anything less than 250k

Still trying to figure out what does this bull have to do with Bitcoin breaking 4400

I love the fact that he bought a 550 and not a 350. Thats justice to BTC!

Due to regulation, Indian exchanges can’t buy from a US exchange and sell to users in India. The buying and selling of cryptocurrencies is done between their own users. The price is higher because the sellers in India are not willing to sell at global price because of the rising demand in India. When markets are volatile the price difference between exchanges increases even more.
