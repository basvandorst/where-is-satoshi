None. That's why they use the "Closest laws to it" to regulate it. Like cyber crimes.

I'm not stealing any electricity. But my consume is high and the goverment doesnt like that. I also sell the btc using the black market exchange rate for the dollar which they don't like either.

Yeah. I'm working as a software developer. I will try to leave the country by the end of the year.

Yeah it's. Lots of people pay to Venezuelans to put their mines here. Recently a farm with 11000 ASCII was found here and took down

I think it's the exactly the opposite. They now what they are doing and they are doing it on purpose. To control us all and steal all the money.

I wan't to sell them. But is not that easy. I can post any ad without getting caught
@_date: 2017-02-13 18:45:10
Yeah i will be moving then soon. If they find them here i will get into serious troubles.

I don't think they will find me because power consumption. My house doesn't even have a power consumption measurer. The problem will be because lots of people nows that i'm mining. And it's a matter of time until someone sees that they can make profit exposing me. Policemen are corrupt right now. They can come whenever they one. took me and my all family to jail and ask me a lot of money to free house. My parents will have to sell their house and it might not be enough

I use local bitcoins.com.. There are a lot of Bitcoin traders here

If it weren't for bitcoin i would be starving. I'm from Venezuela which is having a huge crisis right now and bitcoin helped me to get paid for doing international freelance jobs from my home. Bitcoin is not just good for investment. It's also awesome for third world country's with poorly access (or non) to foreign money

Most of the jobs I got are from r/forhire. I'm a software developer

I'm from Venezuela and bitcoin is pretty popular here. It's easier to buy bicoins than USD dollars. We also have a lot of miners here and there is always a good supply of it.
The main problem is that, although we can buy btc quite easily. Must of the people can afford it. Minimum wage (or as i call it, every employee wage) is around 40$/month. Being able to exchange it for btc and buying stuff outside the country doesn't help much

Well not so popular to have everybody knowing about it. But popular enough to be one of the latam countries with more trading volume at localbitcoins. Which is a lot for a country where 90% of the people makes less than 100$ a month
