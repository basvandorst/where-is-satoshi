I've been out of Bitcoin for awhile. Why is 6ghz considered low now?

Crash Crash! Buy buy! :D

This whole mtgox thing has made me lose faith in bitcoin. One ddos attack and the price crashes massively. How can this be considered a real currency?
@_date: 2013-04-07 22:31:58
I got some now. Now we wait.
@_date: 2013-04-23 03:31:33
People will try anything wont they.

As a recent Graduate from England I'd be happy to be earning that much (its roughly 22k in pounds).
@_date: 2013-04-07 17:57:51
Okay fuck it i'm buying some more this isn't gonna stop. I've been putting this off since 100$
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:17:59
Thats good to here mate! 
@_date: 2013-05-10 22:49:52
localbitcoins.com too. A bit over priced but that is for the ease of access.
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:11:32
5 backups.
@_date: 2013-06-09 11:29:40
I'm not holding, I'm buying : )

BTCE has died lol
@_date: 2013-04-21 00:13:45
And how do we know you aren't one of OKPays competitors? Hrm? Strange that you wouldn't use your personal reddit account.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:00:07
Ha looks like I'm still in profit from my 100$ buy! :D
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:05:08
Thanks, thought I was at least gonna lose 50$ on each coin!
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:23:20
x1000 this. Bitcoin shouldn't be used for major purchases, you need that protection.
@_date: 2013-04-18 04:11:42
PANIC, SELL SELL SELL!
@_date: 2013-04-29 23:15:12
I don't ever tip. Not my job to pay your wage.
@_date: 2013-04-12 03:09:20
Don't worry my deposit hasn't shown up either, surely they aren't gonna lose tens of thousands of bitcoins...are they?
My deposit.

Better than half nonsense you get from the rest of the papers.
@_date: 2013-04-08 13:55:07
You sir, are a generous soul. What goes around comes around.
@_date: 2013-04-08 04:10:36
When I say day to day I mean as the currency you used to buy things (just like BTC now). Not meaning Bitcoins become the main currency of the world, that'd be silly.
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:45:56
I may be interested but I kinda want to see the MTGOX price after its backup and trading again. I can do UKBT or Pingit.
@_date: 2013-04-23 02:14:37
I'm confused. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 02:45:09
Whats to stop BTC going to 10k+? It wouldn't be unsual for the mbtc to be the day to day currency.
@_date: 2013-05-22 21:42:38
Radical change to 'go back to the good old days and get rid of all the blacks, asians and europeans.'
@_date: 2013-05-25 04:12:36
THAT'D BE AWESOME

He means he used Bitcoin to pay for his VPN when they were worth much much less.

UKIP are the most conservative horrible people in England.
@_date: 2013-05-04 00:55:24
Baseless comment?
@_date: 2013-06-01 21:42:11
Fix it again Tony
@_date: 2013-04-16 14:35:54
I'm in shock, a decent article from the Daily Mail. Wow, bet that journalist isn't gonna work for the DM for long!
@_date: 2013-04-09 00:23:58

@_date: 2013-04-10 15:24:42
Haha! This guy is a legend! You know sometimes its nice to see people being kind, makes me feel all warm and fuzzy :D
@_date: 2013-04-13 03:52:45
Its down. Bitcoin crash inc 
@_date: 2013-05-04 00:14:38
Looks like its leveling off to me.
@_date: 2013-04-12 02:58:25
Way too optimistic, but I wouldn't mind it being true ; P
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:51:00
