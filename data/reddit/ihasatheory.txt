During the American civil war, was the union united when the South seceded​ or when the war was over? BU supporters, like it or not, are not some fringe group. Their numbers are significant and their grievances are legitimate. I don't fully support either side in this battle. I think segwit is a technically superior solution in the long term, but BU exists because there was a minority group being marginalized just like you're doing right now. The more their concerns are ignored, the greater chance this gets ugly. Even if core's claim of economic majority are true, that doesn't mean you get to do wtf you want without consideration for smaller factions without serious consequence.

The thing you call bitcoin is not just your the balance in ledger. It's also the dedicated hardware infrastructure underneath that turns a cryptographically verified ledger file into a currency. Miners cannot sustain the cost of running all that hardware without the additional value brought by users, devs, enthusiasts, etc., but the network is useless to all those people without the miners to strengthen and verify its integrity constantly. It is all a mutually beneficial ecosystem in theory. The moment it stops being that, the miners are free to do whatever the fuck they want, including hard fork. There are no rules here. They are not beholden to anyone but themselves, and the rest of the network needs to learn how to deal with that and hopefully work with that knowledge going forward. Either by paying more attention to their needs, or by making the mining power more distributed. I don't know the right answer.
"The audacity that these miners have to do things in their own self interest! They are so selfish!" This is what you wanted when you signed up for an unregulated, decentralized currency. As if 99% of the greedy motherfuckers on this sub wouldn't do the same shit if put in Jihan's position. People keep trying to insist that the miners have no right to do what they're doing, but they're showing everyone that they don't need anyone's clearance to do shit. Maybe this will inject some much needed mutual respect between all participants in bitcoin.

What you're missing is that both sides are Bitcoin, and if there's a split, it's not a situation where they can both go on their merry way. There can only be one in the long run. I agree that it's already ugly, and both communities should be pushing for compromise, because a split is going to be seriously bad for everyone.

The antithesis of decentralization is centralization. There's a difference between being united and being centralized.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:30:37
From what I understand, their problems originally stem more from the long transaction times due to block size (clearly a legit complaint), and the way these concerns and the discourse regarding them have been handled by core and its supporters. In particular, being marginalized through censorship and other tactics. The opposition to segwit is just an extension of that. Seems a lot of them are not directly opposed to segwit and what it brings, but since segwit represents core, that's where the battle lines have been drawn.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:26:36
That doesn't change the fact that unity and centralization are not the same thing.
@_date: 2017-03-14 13:51:58
Maybe. But one could argue that you're being a bit cynical. Cynical is easy and primes you to be more dismissive to a possible solution. Optimism may be naive, but at least it leaves the door open for a solution, no matter how unlikely.

"This is why you need protection insurance."

Then how were the first bitcoins mined?

This is simply not true. It's not even chicken and the egg. Miners came first and miners go first. You would not bet on a network with a vulnerable hashrate. You would wait until you were reasonably sure it was strong enough to withstand attack. So you're following the miners.
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:53:35
The size of the group is immaterial. If the army is the only entity capable of enforcing the rules and protecting the whole, it doesn't matter by how many orders of magnitude we outnumber them, we must accept that they have a certain amount of power in determining how we proceed as a whole, and the more organized they are, the more powerful they become.
And I agree with you, if the entire user base could act as 1, it would certainly be a powerful motivator in their favor. But (a) it's difficult for users to be as organized as miners, and (b) users don't have the power to create alternative networks. There have to be miners to legitimize these networks. So even if 100% of the users went to an alternate network, the only thing that matters is hashrate. Users will never follow a network with a significantly weaker hashrate because of the vulnerability. So still, users will follow miners.

No, you're actually a customer of the miner. You can choose to take your business elsewhere, but if they have the fastest service with the best security, I doubt you will.
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:18:00
If I hire an army to protect me and my friends, the option is always there for any of them to revolt or leave.
If you want to do something and the army doesn't, even if you're right, they can still do whatever the fuck they want, because they're the army.
Without them, you're just a person claiming to have 100 bitcoins with no network to back it up.
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:37:40
Again, you can choose to use another coin. Devs purpose rules, miners enforce and secure them, users abide by them. Anyone is free to leave this agreement at any time. Anyone is free to do what they wish in the ecosystem at any time, including changing the rules. If that doesn't sit with you, you're free to leave. Maybe if enough left, the miners would reverse, but nothing obliges them to do so.

I'm living in a fantasy?
If it were possible to steal or double spend a bitcoin, then having a bitcoin would be worthless, correct? Correct.
OK, what stops me from stealing or double spending a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:04:40
You can sell all the coins you want, if no miners have chosen to follow you, you're coins are meaningless and so is their value.
If some miners follow you, your network is vulnerable, and so is its coin's value.
If the majority of miners follow you, it's really you that followed them because from the first two points, you know people would not buy in to a coin with a vulnerable network.
Users follow miners. In the scenario where miners are split on what to do, the user has more influence, but it's still a choice between whichever coin miners have decided to back.
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:26:19
In reality, the miners say: we're going to do X, and for that service, we will take Y. If you agree with this, we'd love to have you.
If Y is too high, you're free to not use their services, and maybe the miner will adjust if she loses too many customers. Maybe she won't, but nothing obliges her to do so. The community can try to persuade miners what to do, but the game doesn't start without the miners.
I can sit here and say I have 100 billion theorycoins, but it's the first miner running the software that says I do that makes the value of those theorycoins go from 0 to non-zero. This is the objective reality. You're describing your perception of what ought to be.
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:55:59
Then what stops you from double spending a bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:16:42
What do you mean "that's it."? A secure network is what makes the value of a bitcoin non-zero.
@_date: 2017-04-15 21:04:35


Does simply running a full node generate blocks? No, it doesn't. The amount of mental gymnastics you're going through to be deliberately dense is impressive.
