Goto r/btc and tell me I'm wrong tho. I used to sub them for info. But it was not very informative. This sub tbh isn't very informative either. But r/btc is on another level.
I'm really not trying to bash anything. All I'm trying to say is, people at r/Bitcoin seemed to have stopped caring for the most part about Bcash.
@_date: 2018-01-13 08:23:21
I guess ignorance truly is bliss.
If the logo was subject to trademark laws. It won't work. That's all I'm saying.
Just like I can't see the apple logo. Put "tech" underneath it, call it appletech and claim that's a new thing.
It's common sense.
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:58:08
We don't really bash bcash that much. Most of us learn to ignore it, but some memes is still funny. 
Bashing is half of r/btc though..
@_date: 2018-01-09 12:57:29
How so? I can see why it's good for bcash, but not Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:09:17
Thanks for the quick reply.
Maybe this is a little overwhelming for me. I'll goggle a bit about chain size. I admit I  dunno enough to understand the paper yet. But I'll get there. Appreciate the help!
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:10:30
Gonna YouTube that now. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-13 10:27:22
Yep. I'm glad you agree that this hijack is only allowed because it's an open source project. And theres no trademark on it.
And what about market share? Bitcoins market share is still 5x bcash? Also, Bitcoin never aimed to have 100% market share anyway. 
Multiple cyprtos can survive. It's bcash and it's sub reddit that is trying to take over Bitcoin. If you goto r/btc right now, it's mostly about how BCash is the real Bitcoin. Over here at r/Bitcoin, we talk about bitcoins and it's technology (mostly). This subreddit isn't so focused on the FUD of other coins.
@_date: 2018-01-14 12:01:34
I appreciate your help.
I'll read up a bit more. I'm not sure I fully understand what you have said. I will reply to this comment if I have more questions. I would be very grateful if you can help me with my future questions. :)
I downloaded it from bitcoin.com since they pretty much worship the white paper like a Bible. It was also the top googled result.
@_date: 2018-01-14 11:58:10
Im a little confused.
Isnt that part of the paper relates to the hard disk space of a node? I don't understand how it's related to the block size.
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:04:04
I second this.
@_date: 2018-01-13 02:26:10
Except Roger, blockexploerer are calling bcash Bitcoin. It makes sense people who are new to cryptos get confused.
Most other forks don't use the similar logo. Or even try to use the same name. Bcash does. If they think their coin is better, they would use a different name to distinguish themselves.
It's a hijack.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:20:53
Yes you can. There's always a short and long position in a futures contract.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:33:45
I think buying now won't be such a bad idea.
Just be aware that Bitcoin price can fluctuate. Don't panic sell if the price drops, it should bounce back up (it always has since the beginning of Bitcoin)
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:33:10
What about determining the risk levels of borrowers? And what happens when the borrower defaults?
I googled smart contracts, I must admit I don't believe I have a full grasp on the idea yet.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:15:09
Any evidence those 1000 people doesn't lurk in reddit?
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:44:08
Just went back up a little. Some people are buying back.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:45:07
I think the real issue is...it never works perfectly.
If we were to believe that currently there's people manipulating the market before the futures market open, then they would have probably lost quite a bit of money.
The prices dipped for the last few days. When they try to spike the price, a lot of other people simply just sold. If that is the case, you wouldn't profit at all.
Anyways, to answer your question, you can just enter into several futures contract, and your price would more than double.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:54:56
It's not always best to buy in at a dip, simply because u never know when the next dip is.
The price is now at 15k. What if the next dip is at 30k? And it only dips to 23k. In this case, you would have been better off purchasing now.
It also depends what your goal is, if you are just looking to buy and sell in a short time, then it doesn't matter if you bought at 23k. Coz we expect the price to rise again after the dip.
The price sort of matters when you are in for the long haul, coz that directly affects how many bitcoins you hold in the long run.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:52:48
Mostly everyone buy at ATH, still made money. Hold for a week. And you will know what we mean.
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:39:29
That's like Tim cook holding google shares, which he isn't allowed to.
And to be honest, why bother hedging if he is so confident about Bcash?
He can talk all he wants, but hes just here for the money. He doesn't care if Bcash or btc comes through.
He would sell bcash immediately if he feels it's not worth holding anymore. He would dump the whole project and leave it to die once he's made enough. That's the kind of person that backs bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:02:34
I know what you mean.
I guess what I'm trying to say is, the people that post here are looking for help. And they are in the midst of doing their own  research, they clearly don't understand something. And that's fine. Let's give them a hand and let them know we are here to help.
I'm here for the long haul, I have put quite a lot of my savings in it. But I still can't sit comfortably watching the price decline for the last few days. I think I can understand how the newcomers feel.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:13:43
I'm not sure I understand what you mean. care to explain? I think what Chris is saying seems to make more sense to me.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:39:48
Basically, you are talking about hedging.
A Delta neutral portfolio is just a portfolio of assets where the delta of the portfolio is zero, meaning a change in the price of the asset won't affect the price of the portfolio itself. (I won't get into how the delta changes as price moved, etc.)
This has nothing to do with a long and short position of a single futures contract. I don't get why you have to bring up delta neutral portfolios.
Also no need to have that sort of attitude about me reading wiki. I had a degree in finance years back and also did CFA as well. I decided not to pursue a career in finance cause i made more money elsewhere. And no offence, you still sound like someone who deosnt know what he's talking about or is simply real bad at explaining stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:34:55
You would still borrow from banks, not people. Only banks are able too take the risk if people defaulting on their loan. They also have to expertise to see how much each person should be able to borrow etc.
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:50:12
Yeah. But doing stuff off the main chain requires both software and hardware, which could still lead to high fees for microtranscations. Am I right in saying that?
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:43:27
1. Yes. The price dropped to a few days ago. Everyone knows this. But that doesn't make people feel any better when there's a 20 percent drop. I didn't invest for long, but a part of me is still scared when the price dips.
2. Everyone wants a piece of the cake. I do, and you do too. We are no different.
3. If I don't do any research about btc, it doesn't make me any less worthy to invest in btc. Also, the fact that they bothered to come on Reddit to ask for advice is good enough for me.
Just look at how Andreas responds to questions. He doesn't tell people to "can't you see we are at the ath three days ago?". He understands that the fears people have is genuine. 
No one knows whats going to happen to the price. Not everyone is here for the long haul, we get it. But just remember they are not any less worthy.
Stop bashing on the new guy.
@_date: 2017-12-10 21:17:46
I honestly don't think it matters. The amount of traffic that is required from using Bitcoin should be minimal. It's the processing power is needed. 
But I'm not certain though, I can easily be prove wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:32:26
It's the price of a future contract that can go-to zero. Not the value of Bitcoin itself. (Technically btc can go-to zero, but I don't think that's what he meant)
Futures are called a financial derivative, which means it's price is dependent on the price of something else, in our case - btc.
Future contract often can have a value of zero at expiration.
I'm not sure this is a good explanation, but I hope it helped.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:43:12
If it's your first purchase. I would recommend setting up a cold wallet offline and transfer the funds there. 
Setting up the wallet is free.
There will be some fees (it maybe significant for you tho).
Setting up the new wallet allow you to understand how keys work etc. It may cost you some money to transfer, but I think it's worth at least doing it once.
Just my two cents.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:26:08
Hi there,
Welcome to the world of Bitcoin.
Basically, there are two things you need to do, buying Bitcoin, and storing Bitcoin.
Buying Bitcoin:
You can purchase Bitcoin from any of the online exchanges. However, you want to find one who takes deposits in fiat currency. Fiat currency basically means money that is distributed by your government, assuming you live in the US. Its US dollars. I know some exchanges, but I don't want to be biased and recommend any. I don't even live in the US, I just use the exchange in my own country.
Storing Bitcoin:
After purchasing Bitcoin, if it is a small amount. You can just leave it in the exchange account. But the best and recommended way is to use a cold wallet. A cold basically a device that stores your key to your bitcoins. You can either create your own and purchase one online.
As a newcomer, I would recommend trying to make your own, it would help you understand how bitcoins work a lot better.
I personally use:
Hope this helps. I'm not the best at explaining stuff.
Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:27:00
Satoshi wanted unlimited blocksize. Or so I read in r/btc.
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:44:16
If you find the memes hilarious, can't they find the memes hilarious and come for the memes?
You are simply projecting what you think onto others whom you don't even know. It's almost like saying:
1. I don't like chocolate ice cream,.
2. The winklevoss thinks like me.
3. So the winklevoss twins don't like chocolate ice cream.
In any case, you don't have any evidence to show that they don't read reddit, so I dunno...Let's just leave it at that.
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:21:25
Futures market is opening for bitcoin.
No one actually knows what's going to happen.
But a lot of speculators are selling because they think it's a risk.
@_date: 2017-12-16 11:42:52
Sure. No one owns it. But we all know what Roger is trying to do here. He isn't trying to show how BCash is different. In fact, get trying to create as much confusion between the two as possible. 
And he's good at it too. Just two months ago, I also thought Bitcoin cash and Bitcoin were the same thing. I also visited Bitcoin.com and read what he wrote and believed it.
He's just lucky bitcoins code is open source and is owned by nobody. I guess that's the loophole he found and is exploiting it.
There's no reason to use the name bitcoin if he genuinely thinks the tech behind Bitcoin cash is better. Why would he wanna align his product with another product that he thinks it's inferior?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:38:10
Got ya. Thanks for that. And I suppose LN won't have scaling issues? U can always have more off chain nodes if needed, right?
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:34:18
May I ask what is the significance in 2020?
I'm a new investor. Just put a big chunk of my savings in bitcoins. I have 2 btc right now. I guess I'm one of those people that bought in for the hype, but now trying to understand what I got myself into.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:42:53
Just remember not all of us have to voice our opinion on Reddit. I have been a Reddit lurker for a while and only recently started talking. Theres a lot of people out there who reads and don't post at all.
Also, the fact is, let's say I have 50 btc, would I be telling reddit?
And of course most people on Reddit arent gonna be great. Even if all 1000 of people were on Reddit, they would be ounumbered by the rest of us anyways. And you won't be able to tell if they are here or not.
The original post is stating a fact, if the majority of the people holding btc don't go back to fiat currency, the price won't fall. It's simple logic, nothing wrong with that. 
And if the price does fall in a few days, it's because people sold.
No need to make things more complicated than it should be. It's finance, not rocket science.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:32:14
Theres two types of people, one which does what you suggest, buying low and selling high. They are commonly referred to as day traders.
Day trading is not easy at all. A lot of day traders lose money in the long run.
Then there's people like me. Just hold since the market is bullish right now.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:59:29
Lol. I'm just gonna leave it here. You are free to believe what you want. It's already clear to me what's going on with you.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:04:55
I currently use a cold offline wallet setup by myself with bitkey.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:45:34
Wake up, don't be a sheep.
He doesnt care if Bitcoin scales, he also doesn't care if Bcash scales. He only cares if hes walking away with more money.
He would destroy Bitcoin and bcash if it meant that he made an x amount of dollars (whatever it's worth for him to do so). Sure, you can argue it's smart for him to do so.
But I would rather follow someone who actually cares about the success of cryptocurrency instead of someone who o ly cares for his own well being.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:08:29
Glad we both agree.
Replace "chocolate ice cream" with what you are saying. That's basically the jist of your argument.
It's funny how people who call other people stupid...and don't see the irony...
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:54:17
Sounds like an in game currency more than a cryptocurrency.
Its just like gems.
You can earn gems by doing specific tasks etc.
I'll be honest, I stopped reading half way though.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:53:59
Yes. But it would be silly for someone like a Winklevoss twins to not be aware of reddit.
You are basically assuming all the people that holds most of the coins don't come to reddit at all because peoples post/memes are stupid.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:39:42
Yep. And...the name recognition comes from Bitcoin having value.
I think you misunderstood what people here are saying.
Nobody is against him holding bitcoin.
People just find it annoying that he says bitcoins are shit when in reality he thinks Bitcoin is fine.
The fact is, he doesnt perceive Bitcoin as being rubbish, because if he did, he would "diversify" his money elsewhere.
He clearly is a smart guy. But I wouldn't listen to what he says, but rather what he does. If he's holding bitcoin, then he thinks Bitcoin has value. Simple as that.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:35:48
You are right. As a digital currency, just remember store of value isn't the only thing about BTC. I don't think anyone is refuting this point at all.
Its also meant to be a medium of exchange as well. And with the current transaction fees, this is upsetting quite a number of people. Hopefully LN rolls out soon and we will see improvements.
Also, almost all of us start off as speculators. :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:05:18
Bitcoin and Bitcoin cash are totally two different things now.
It's on and off chain payments.
No one feels threatened by Bitcoin cash, if we did, we would just buy bitcoin cash. (Btw, Roger ver himself feels threatened, that's why he holds bitcoins himself)
We just find it super annoying coz Bitcoin cash is living off the success of bitcoin.
In short, Bitcoin cash is worth nothing if people weren't coming confused by the two. It's the reason why Roger got so angry when people called Bitcoin cash as bcash.
On chain payments doesnt scale. It doesn't even work in theory, even if you increase it's block size. For it to work on a large scale, you can only ever have a few nodes, then you are back to square one, being centralised again.
I'm happy to explain further if you like. It sounds like you hold bcash, it's important you know what you got yourself into.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:41:30
This is normal for btc. You will get used to these drops soon.
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:42:45
Anyone with enough money can influence the price.
But that goes with all things.
Once the insitutitons get involved, hopefully some regulations would be in place. But then again, it begs the question of whether regulations are a good thing.
Just my two cents.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:43:46
Most coins forked and distinguish themselves as something different. But bcash doesn't, why would Roger get angry when Bitcoin cash was called bcash otherwise?
Either you don't know what propaganda means, or you dunno enough about on and off chain networks. It's not propaganda, on and off chain networks was the reason why bcash was created. You asked me why one is better than the other, I'm trying to explain the difference to you.
Most of what you said are based on opinions rather than facts. I'm just gonna leave it here.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:17:19
I actually understood what you meant but not him.
In a contract, someone is always short and someone else is always long. Thats how it is. How can it be any other way? I don't get it.
I maybe speaking out of line here. But the other guy doesn't seem to know what he is talking about?
EDIT: just read wiki, you're right, he's wrong. Dismiss what he said.
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:31:57
Are you implying Roger Ver isn't trying to sell bcash as Bitcoin?
Well he is. And that's a scam.
Nothing wrong with having a stickied post mentioning about it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:40:01
You don't diversify your portfolio with rubbish. You would only purchase stocks/coins with value.
Same reason you wouldn't "diversify" your portfolio with grade c shit you dunno.
Diversifying is fine. But don't say Bitcoin is shit, then hold a bunch of Bitcoin. If he truly believed Bitcoin is bad, he would diversify his money elsewhere. That is literally the definition of being a hypocrite.
In fact, if you believe bitcoin is shit, you would short it.
Like I said, he's in it for the money. And hes putting his money in what he values. He values both bcash AND Bitcoin. It's not hard to see.
In fact, he values Bitcoin so much, he tries to sell his bcash as Bitcoin. If it were shit, why do so? Wouldn't you want to differentiate your product?
You cant seriously believe he's being genuine when he says Bitcoin is shit and he has money in it. Wake up.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:37:28
No problem. Let us know if you have trouble with anything. :)
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:47:53
you should have your funds in a cold wallet. :)
@_date: 2017-12-16 05:48:19
It's a scam.
You don't see google trying to sell off their phones as iphone.
You dont see Teslas trying to sell theirs cars off like Ferraris.
But you see bcash trying to confuse customers who are actually trying to buy bitcoin (not bcash).
If you goto bitcoin.com(a site to promote bcash owned by Roger very), you will see how bcash is promoted. And how it's a scam.
I was considering bcash a month ago, but stepped away pretty quickly, because I soon realised bcash only survives off Bitcoin. And that's the only advantage they have.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:50:37
If you aren't too serious about it. I would say just leave it in there.
Without understanding Bitcoin, it's hard to explain how the fees work. Basically the Bitcoin network is very congested at the moment with all the hype, so the fees are quite high at the moment to transfer bitcoin.
Grats on getting into Bitcoin. It's a great time to be in it!
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:08:37
Yep. Did what you said. Downvote.
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:39:23
The whales also need someone from whom they can buy the futures contract from. its a huge amount, there just aren't that many people doing it.
Also, if they were to sell out, and also short the future, But the price actually went up, they would end up losing money. It isn't risk free for them.
@_date: 2019-08-17 03:21:22
Personally, I bought during the bubble, and are still hodl'ing. I put in what a consider a considerable amount. Sometimes I feel like I am hodl'ing just for the sake of it. I haven't followed Bitcoin as closely as I used to. It was a lot of pressure back then checking the price everyday. While I haven't sold any, nowadays, I don't follow the news anymore and from time to time I will check the price to see what's up.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:45:00
I'm gonna be downvoted for this...but what the heck.
I currently work in Hong Kong myself. And what he is saying couldn't be furthered from the truth.
There's a lot of media groups out there whom are biased (for both sides). Most media groups report only a certain side of the story.
Support for the HK movement by actual HKers are actually probably split 50/50 (my estimate). There's very little info in regards to the damages rioters have done to HK, and if they did, it would be immediately downvoted (most likely without even having read it).
Most people in HK support the cause (myself included), but are very fed up with what the rioters are doing and what they are claiming. Most people in HK believe both sides have their faults.
It's a real eye opener how media can shape reality for the people. Theres so much crowd thinking as well. I'm not here to discuss politics really. There's a lot of misinformation from both sides that can be easily fact checked via google. I do wish people can look at comments/news with a grain of salt.
@_date: 2019-10-10 07:38:07
It's just shunning. We may not agree on whom we shun, but we both don't need to justify it either.
Anyway, i just feel it's important to accept other people's point of view. Like I mentioned many times before, there are a lot of people in HK who are for the movement but are against the riot.
And I'm sure there are people out there who are pro Beijing as well.
But we don't hear about them these days. As they are constantly oppressed as it is 'justified'.
It's important for us all to accept all these points of view. And ironically yes, even some of the viewpoints of the ccp.
After all, isn't that the spirit of democracy? a society where different points of view are allowed. If not, aren't we just the same as ccp? We would be just shunning everyone that doesn't agree with us. And that's quite a scary thought.
@_date: 2019-10-10 05:21:11
That's both sides though.
China is notorious for this.
But what people don't seem to realise is that CNN and BBC are just the same. You really have to be in HK to really know what's going on.
@_date: 2019-10-10 05:02:40
Hold on a sec here.
So u r saying, that people who shout "I support the HK police" deserves to be beaten or have their properties damaged?
@_date: 2019-10-10 03:41:56
Woah. Hold up.
Since when is 'expressing support' a crime and are no longer innocent? People should not be hurt just because they view things differently. 
If I came out on the street yelling "I love china, fuck you cockroaches" in mandarin. I'm sure I'm gonna be beaten quite badly (as is the case for a lot of people already). But that's quite an extreme case, but he's still innocent. You get the point.
Remember, we live on our lives as everyday citizens too. The rioters definitely should have their opinions heard, but so do those who are against rioters. There's a lot of oppression going on. There's a lot of people I know that hate the rioters (they are for the movement, but against the rioting, myself included). They are afraid to come out to tell them to stop. Can you imagine if you are actually pro-china? We need freedom of speech on both sides.
I have seen first-hand how rioters treats normal everyday citizens. Riots have happened where I live. To be quite honest, there's some monster mentality going on.
Most of the people who came out marching are not FOR rioting (at least talks between people I know). There are people who just simply dont believe rioting helps. It hurts to see HK being destroyed by rioters like this.
Not quite sure what you meant after about violence.

For discussion sake, why would a fixed supply of gold eventually cause deflation?
A btc worth today should be worth the same in years time (given btc being the currency and taking into account time value)
The value of the btc would be in theory exactly the same as the worth of the worlds aseets divided by 21 million (that's all the assets in the world). You should be indifferent between owning a piece of asset or btc, because their returns would be exactly the same (on average).
What I'm trying to say is, if a piece of asset is worth 1 btc, you would be indifferent too owning either one. Putting personal preference aside of course.
On the other hand, you could argue because some btc is eventually lost forever (lost private keys). 1 btc is eventually worth more than 1 btc later. But maybe the assets valuation would also reflect that too. That...I'm not sure.
I just dont understand why people keep saying theres deflation because people would not spend btc. I know there's quite a few people on this subreddit who think so too. But I truly believe they have been misinformed.
@_date: 2019-10-09 15:57:09
Seriously, even though the video may seem biased, these are actual photos being taken. Actual properties being damaged and actual innocent lives being affected.
I live on HK myself currently.
We all want freedom and not to be oppressed, sure, so do I.
But it really doesn't justify actions like this. There are people/businesses in HK being beaten/shunned for simply expressing support for the police. Then you have the police coming afterwards with their guns and pepper sprays etc.
Come on guys. No matter what your views are, violence is wrong, that's for both sides. I really cant support either side.
@_date: 2019-10-10 06:29:06
Then I'm confused. It seems you and I are on the same side?
@_date: 2019-02-02 05:06:21
While you are right about interest rates affecting money supply.
It's not true deflation discourages money spending. On the other hand, it encourages it.
Since there is gonna be a fixed supply of 21mil, you won't get inflation, this part is true. So...without inflation, we gonna get low interest rates. And with low interest rates, you get more consumption. This  is textbook stuff. 
Supply being inelastic is true. But again, you are definitely making the assumption here. Supply of Bitcoin is inelastic, but money supply isn't. Because of M2 and M3 money generated in the economy.
I agree with deflation causing unemployment etc. This is also textbook. I just don't think a fixed supply would cause deflation.
This is all theory of course.
And data? Name a single country with a fixed supply? If there is, I really would like to read about it (not sarcastic).
@_date: 2019-02-02 09:27:22
Gold isn't fixed back then. You could literally dig/mine gold.
Earth has a fixed supply of gold, sure. But the supply of gold in the market were increasing (through people digging gold constantly).

Lets do an example.
Let say we have 10 cows, and that's all the assets in the world. How much is each worth?
Well, that would be 2.1mil. (21m divided by 10)
And then let's say these cows all now just doubled their production of milk and their value increased. How much would they be worth now?
Answer: since there is still only 21mil btc, they would still be worth the same.
The point here is, assets do increase in value, sure. But it would be exactly the same rate as the change in value if btc too. If assets goes up by 10 percent on value, so does btc.
Of course, this only works if btc is adopted worldwide.
Anyways, let's do another example and hope it clears it up.
Say we still have 10 cows. But now in a years time, the world produced another 10 cows.
So now, each cow is worth 1.15mil. Well, that's deflation. So now I should hoard btc and don't spend it.
This would be the wrong interpretation of deflation. This is in fact a normal result of the market. Each cow is actually worth less now because there's just more of them out there. Think of your phone, its just gonna be worth less a year later. It's just how assets work. But remember, you also enjoyed a years worth of milk from the cow by owning them. In this case, (in theory at least), the milk would be worth 1.15mil (but can not be sold, we have to view this as intangible benefits). and because the milk + new value of cow is still 2.1mil. That's why i would say you are indifferent in owning either the cow or the btc.
This is of coz a VERY simple example.
If we are to include the effects of money being generated (M2 and M3) and interest rates. Then YES, you can have deflation. But this then exists whether you are using a fixed supply or not. So this point would be mute.
Edit: another way to think of it is:
If the price changed, is it caused by a change in the value of btc? Or is it caused by a change in value of the asset?
If the drop in value came from btc worthing more (meaning assets are still actually the same, but the somehow each asset is worth less btc), then yes, you have deflation.
For every other cause of deflation, it's just how the economy works. (Such as people losing A LOT of confidence in market to the point where they value their btc more than buying anything.) These can happen in both Fiat and btc. It doesn't matter if it's either.

Not sure you actually know what insider trading is...
Thats the same as your doctor selling drugs to you that don't work.
In both cases, the people with knowledge here has a responsibility to share that info and act as an agent for others.
If there's no such responsibility, then it's fine. (But then it wouldn't be insider trading). Say for some reason, you found information independently and are not related to the company in question, and you profited from that, then that's ok. That's just trading.
Remember, a director is being renumerated for doing his job. He does have that responsibility.
@_date: 2019-04-17 11:40:47
No it's not.
If I paid you to be my doctor, you automatically have a responsibility to act as my agent. After all, I paid you. There's no point in me paying for a doctor that won't act in my favor after all.
Same scenario if you are a director.
That's why I'm saying you don't actually know what insider trading is. What you are referring to are just people who simply have more knowledge than others but no responsibility. No one has issues with those profiting.

I am not saying you have to use a bank.
But would u realistically keep all your bitcoins in a private key and not spend it if theres a bank out there offering interest just for you to keep it there.
When the sums get to a large amount, say 1 mil, would u still not put it in a btc bank?
And I agree about looking for a reputable place to store your btc.

There's still a difference between real interest rate and nominal interest rate though.
@_date: 2019-01-24 11:07:27
What I'm trying to say is:
Most people would still use a bank like they do now, because that's just how a financial system works. By most, I mean 99%. And most likely everyone here on Reddit.
The interest rate would be defined by the market. Not some arbitrary number. If the interest rate is 0.2 percent, there would naturally be a huge incentive to borrow money and invest (unless the economy looks bad and everything isn't worth investing).
Bitcoin doesn't mean lacking a financial system. Most people would still be a part of it. I just don't think keeping your coins in a private wallet is a realistic.
Just my pov tho.
@_date: 2019-01-24 01:24:34
What if the bank offered interest for letting them keep it though?

Inflation doesn't exist in Bitcoin.
The amount is fixed at 21 million.
I'm asking for the very long term where people don't use the USD anymore.

I'm no techie. But I was told I don't need segwit if I'm just hodling. Is that still true?
There's is much to spend with Bitcoin in my daily activities at where I live.
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:15:17
Nah. I understand that. But I'm asking at a point in time which is pass that. A time when LN is all ironed out and adopted. I can't say it's definitely gonna happen, and even if it does, it would take a long time.
Most people are buying cryptos to sell at some point. They eventually exit the market. That's fine, I'm happy they contributed to the price going up at some point at least.
Its gonna take a very long time, I think I just realised not everyone sees the way I see Bitcoin. :(
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:13:59
Oh. Is that so? Should I be selling off my btc and buy my bch?
@_date: 2019-01-24 14:07:24
That's not how money works.
If I borrowed a cow from you, I would milk the cow enough that it would be worth more than 1.5 cows. Then return the 1.5 cows to you.
In fact, lending and borrowing creates money in the market. Google M1, M2 and M3.
Think you may have confused interest and inflation. They are related but not the same. Interest is something inate to all asset classes, regardless of currency.

The spanner is $10.
The job itself is $1000.
The value is the spanner is not $1000 (to you or anybody). If it were, economics would dictate you to keep buying spanners until price=value (given you have enough money and no alternatives)
Im not paying $1000 for the spanner. I'm paying $1000 for the job. The extra $990 you got was because of the time and knowledge that you have.
I'm not sure what the third paragraph meant though.

Why have a few nodes? Why not just have 1 node if you are running a business? That would be most efficient. Is it not?
Perhaps I'm missing something here. But I remember watching Andreas on YouTube and he mentioned the same thing. (I admit I'm just repeating what he's saying at this point)
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:12:24
The long term vision of Bitcoin is to replace fiat, not to convert btc to usd, then use that USD to make a purchase. I'm not saying it's definitely gonna happen but at least I believe in it.
So the fact that you mentioned converting to fiat to buy stuff isn't what was assumed.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:33:41
Sorry. Thought u were a troll trying to promote bch. My bad.
You don't seem to believe in LN.

You dunno this. Neither does the US government. The tax laws around crypto is not ironed out yet. Basically tax laws did not account for cryptos when it was written.
Answer this, I purchased a property for 1btc then sold it off for 2btc. I didn't transact in USD at all. How should I be taxed?
And if cryptos is used, why can't the government tax in btc?

There still needs to be more technology to support using Bitcoin too.
Such as being able to pay through nfc with your phone, so paying small amounts would be easy. It's gonna be a while longer than 3 years though. I would say longer than 10 years. But that's just me.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:12:16
I agree with this.
However, that would be true for someone who is watching the markets and predicting whether the trend is going up or down.
For someone like me who mostly follows the tech news instead of the price, its just much easier to buy and hold.
I'm not saying which strategy is better or worse. I'm just trying to point out that there are two types of people in the world and we are in it for different things.

I'm not waiting 7 hours moving between my wallets. How come it's taking that long for you?
@_date: 2018-02-08 00:07:22
Well. If everyone accepts it, the value of one Bitcoin would be extremely high. In theory, if everyone is using Bitcoin, and no one is using the USD, then the value of 1btc to usd is infinity.
So price and value are correlated. Price reflects the value.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:00:56
That's the point. If everyone had crypto, price would be stable. That's why it takes a long time to adopt.
And also that's why the early adopters get paid off because they are able to survive through the huge price fluctuations. The price fluctuations are not just due to whales, the technology itself is not mature yet as well.
I don't see how block chain can be used much elsewhere. It's a very inefficient technology due to it's decentralisation.
@_date: 2018-02-08 01:31:35
Whales won't have a huge enough influence on the markets then.
