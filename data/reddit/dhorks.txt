You do get a discount. For every dollar's worth in BTC you spend on Gyft you get 3 "points". 100pts gives you a dollar off (and you can use them in less than chunks of 100). Basically, it means everything is 3% off.

Do you feel it would be fair if prices rose by 4 days from now and they charged you more? If not then then you shouldn't feel this is unfair either. You agreed to a price. That's how it works.

You probably want to as a real tax specialist.
From what I have learned reading up on this the last few days:
Case 1: Yes, tax wise, every transaction you do with property (which includes all coins) is basically considered exchanging that property for it's value in USD then buying the other property for that amount. When you buy those dogecoin for one bitcoin, tax wise it is considered selling your bitcoin for $600 and buying $600 worth of dogecoin. Since you only paid $500 for the bitcoin you'll pay tax on the $100 profit. Same thing if you wanted to go back.
Case 2: This is significantly trickier. Typically, with something fungible (meaning each item of it is indistinguishable, aka 1 share of stock vs another share of stock or one $10 bill and another) you can use a variety of different methods for determining profit. There is FIFO (first in first out) where the first amount that you bought is also the first amount that you sold. In the FIFO case you could consider having made gain off the cold storage coin ($520 profit here for 1BTC). Another method is LIFO (last in first out) where you consider the last amount purchased as the first that you spend. In this case you would only pay for the profit off the later bought bitcoins. I know that you can use FIFO for bitcoins (I think it was mentioned in an article about the IRS stuff) but I'm not sure about LIFO (and I think there are other allowed methods for other stuff too). It is also possible that because you literally can prove which bitcoins are which via the blockchain, that you can claim you actually did spend those later bought coins, not the earlier ones. I'm pretty sure if you did this on your taxes for one transaction you'd have to do it every time (always keeping track of exactly which bitcoins are used when). The IRS is not okay with you cherry-picking how you report profits on a per transaction basis, you choose one method and you must stick to it.
Again, I'm no expert but I hope this helps.

Check out  or coinbase's FAQ, documentation etc. People are downvoting because you aren't contributing to the conversation and are potentially misleading people.
If you actually use coinbase (or pretty much any wallet) you'll see you have a wallet that is associated with your account and whenever you want you can generate new addresses. People often generate a new address for every single transaction. 1.2 million seems like it would be far too few wallet addresses and if they really were citing their number of addresses it would be extremely misleading and inconsistent with what they call a wallet. Also, on coinbase, since they hold all your coins there is absolutely no reason to generate an address when you buy coins, they simply credit your wallet.
@_date: 2014-04-22 07:27:28
Blockchain doesn't do that. I recommend using coinbase if you are in the US and want to buy bitcoins, here is my referral link 
If you use it and buy +$100 worth of bitcoins you'll get $5 worth free.

I'm guessing you got locked out because you used up your limits of incorrect 2FA attempts which you also need for logging in.
The two most common reasons for your 2FA not working are either you are entering them too slowly and they expire before become they are confirmed or (and this just happened to me the other day) you aren't entering in the correct code. I accidentally entered my google auth code instead of my bitfinex code the other day multiple times.
If you don't think it could be either of these I would recommend contacting coinbase help.
I haven't heard any rumors of coinbase worrying about people withdrawing. I do know that if you attempt to sell or withdraw too much at once they might have to delay it as they keep 95% of their bitcoins in cold storage so that in the off chance they are compromised, the most they could lose is their ~5% in their hot wallet.

Remember you can write off losses too. If you bought dogecoins (as I did), I'm guessing they have gone down in value since you got them. If you used them for something (including buying bitcoins back) you can write off the loses.

Sure, but that isn't what I was addressing. You said using Gyft provides no advantages. Even if it is only 2% off (affectively, assuming you use coinbase) that is still an advantage.
I am not purchasing things from overstock or tigerdirect because they don't have anything I want. If I wasn't using Gyft I'd still buy what I want on amazon but using a credit card, so I don't see how I'm "slowing" bitcoin's growth. Gyft is still a company accepting and using bitcoin and I think supporting them is still good for bitcoin as a whole. It sounds like you are just upset that a company which would have big affect on the visibility of bitcoin isn't doing what you want.
If amazon was really interested, I'm sure they could request information on how many giftcards Gyft has sold using bitcoin.

But money spent doesn't have to be proportional to electricity consumed. For example, X11 mining uses less electricity than scrypt mining despite using the same graphics cards (hence same hardware cost). This is purely due to differences in the algorithm. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 09:02:08
You are missing how the bets work. If you did that you would end up spending 10-3.12=6.88 mBTC (to short it) and spending 5.15 mBTC (to buy a long share) spending 12.03 mBTC to only win 10mBTC. It can be a little confusing, I suggest changing the odds format to decimal which will tell you how many times your original bet you will make if you win. In this case, you'll see you'll make your bet x 1.43 if you bet the dems loose and they do and you'll make your bet x 1.90 if you bet the dems win and they do.
Trust me, it is very unlikely you'll find any bets that you can "arbitrage". There is a slightly greater chance (but still very small) that you'll be able to "arbitrage" by betting on two mutually exclusive events, eg. dem wins presidency and rep wins presidency.

I have a mac so I had to run the client through a Windows emulator.

Yeah, I did flip them accidentally. I think I've fixed it now.
I think a lot of the reason they haven't gained as much traction is due to network effects. Bitcoin has a big first mover advantage and has been around much longer. In regards to other altcoins I think part of the problem with new PoW coins is they have a get rich quick aspect that pushes them initially.
I also think some of the problems in bitcoin like a lack of full nodes and a 51% attack haven't been too large of an issue yet. The wasted power issue is more a tragedy of the commons issue. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 04:09:17
Yes, this is purely MtGox, the past few hundred drop was mostly Gox but partly the other issues. The current state is 100% due to Gox.
Guessing what it will drop to would be nothing but wild speculation and I wouldn't be surprised if in the panic after official Gox announcement the low points could vary significantly between exchanges.
I do think it will rebound or I probably wouldn't be holding any BTC right now. As far as when and how high, no idea.

Ah yeah, I probably shouldn't have left out Peercoin, I just know the least about it.

They use a maker/taker model. Basically, you only pay a fee (0.75%) if you fill an order (taker). If you make the order (maker) you actually get a bonus (0.25%). It encourages the spread to be smaller, as you could imagine someone opening a buy order at exactly the current lowest sell order price without actually filling the sell order because they want to avoid paying the fee. This tends to increase liquidity now someone who wants to buy or sell **now** without waiting for their order to get filled can fill either the buy or sell at the same price. If a few minutes later they change their mind and want to do the opposite they can with only paying the 0.75% fees instead of the fee + the spread. This model also tends to encourage people who want to make large trades as they not only avoid fees but actually get a bonus on them.

I've been using Predictious for a while. I'm not sure what you are talking about in terms of arbitrage. I'm assuming you mean betting on both winning or both loosing. I think you are misunderstanding how Predictious works given the example you gave. If you bet both the Reps and the Dems would win you would pay 11.89 mBTC and would be nearly guaranteed to win 10 mBTC (minus small fees). If you bet both would loose you would pay 12.17 mBTC and again would win 10 mBTC.

I don't blame them for that, infact, I sort of wish bitcoin was willing to do a major update and possibly implement some of these changes  . What mostly bothered me was that there seemed to be limited warning before the new client was released. Actually I just now read the post about the update and realize it wasn't quiet as dire as the top post in seed to imply but still, I hope they don't have to go through another hard fork and in the future they give a bit more warning.

Wow, I had no idea fees were that high. I assumed the percent was small enough that sellers would charge the same amount to appear consistent but +10% is way too much to not price in.

I feel the purpose of bitcoin is to be used as a digital currency. While low transaction fees is an advantage of bitcoin over money orders, credit cards, etc., bitcoin can still be used perfectly well within a system like PayPal where they are acting as the arbitrators of the transaction. In principle it is the same as what they have on CryptoThrift except PayPal has a higher fee. In principle PayPal could decrease their fee with bitcoin transactions.

I know this won't be popular here but there **are** problems with Bitcoin and there are alternatives that solve many of the problems while still using a blockchain and providing incentives. The simplest and one of the oldest alternatives is using Proof of Stake over Proof of Work.
Here are some problems with Bitcoin which PoS solves:
1. Waste of electricity: Many people will jump in to say that the power isn't wasted, it is being used to secure the network. This is like saying driving your own bus to work everyday isn't wasting fuel because you have to get to work. A hybrid or a smart car will do the same job but at a much lower cost. We have also seen the amount of miners and their power explode over the past year. This is spending both more electricity in running these miners and spending human capital having engineers designing new machines which do nothing but hash. Even with all this spending, I wouldn't say the Bitcoin blockchain is "more secure" than it was a year ago.
A Proof of Stake system randomly selects a coin in an active wallet (basically a full node) and the owner mines the next block.
2. Danger of a 51% attack: We have seen several times this past year, one mining pool has been controlled close to or just over 51% of all hashing power, meaning if an individual who controlled this pool (normally or via hacking) wanted to they could create double spend transactions and do all sorts of things that would destroy all faith in Bitcoin. This is completely against the trust-less decentralized ideal of Bitcoin. I worry that if the price of bitcoin doesn't go up by the time of the next block halving, more and more miners will drop out, leaving mining even more centralized and in danger of a 51% attack.
In a Proof of Stake system, a 51% attack would only be possible if someone owned 51% of all coins. Almost everyone is an effective miner so the network is highly decentralized.
3. Lack of full nodes: There is currently no incentive to an individual to run a full node beyond altruism towards the network. The average user who may not have a computer that is on 24/7 and doesn't have the space, time, or bandwidth to run a full node won't (I know the size issue may be addressed in the near future). If the number of full nodes doesn't scale up there will be issue with speed of propagation through the network.
For Proof of Stake, everyone who has a non-trivial holding in their wallet runs a full node as they have a chance of mining the next block.
I'm not saying PoS is the only way of the future, I'm just giving one example of how Bitcoin the network and bitcoin the currency are not the only way to use a blockchain and that some alternatives solve some of Bitcoin's problems.
EDIT: accidentally said PoW when I meant PoS

Yeah, I agree for the most part. As far as the amount of money I have invested in crypto I'm about 90% BTC 9% DOGE and ~1% BRC (percentages as amount in USD). I guess my only problem with LTC is that it doesn't have that much going for it except being oldest, second to BTC and I feel like BTC is as popular and as big as it is largely due to being the oldest and there is really only space for one coin to get buy on age. Also, LTC has really seemed to use it's time in existence to grow that much, unlike BTC or even DOGE.

How exactly do you plan to get over 50% of miners to accept that when they already have millions sunk into their ASICs?

Bitfinex all the way. Low fees, margin trading, earning interest on lending.
 &lt;--Referral link gives 10% off fees for first month

This is great! I've used Mint for a while and this will make it nicer to keep it all in one place.

My strategy for trading is to buy BTC on coinbase and sell on the exchange (I suggest Bitfinex over btc-e, seems less shady   &lt;--Referral link).
You pay more fees initially but if you plan to trade frequently it ends up being much less in fees. Their money wires are "relatively" low cost, although I'll probably just buy BTC when it is relatively stable and send them back to coinbase to sell.
If you time it right, sometimes you buy on coinbase when their price is low and Bitfinex's is relatively high (usually it is the other way around).

Just musing about it. Actively considering would mean doing research and discussing how it could be implemented within current frameworks.

Buffett said to stay away from bitcoin first in March of last year when the price of bitcoin was between 400-600. Clearly the price is well below that now. **HE WAS RIGHT.**
You can argue all you like about the pros and the future of bitcoin but he is an investor and he was correct that buying bitcoin was a bad investment at the time. Maybe the price of bitcoin will go up in the future but that doesn't change the fact that he was correct to not want to invest in bitcoin a year ago.

See the above comments. Card details are stored on a chip on the phone for iPhone/Samsung whereas Google and PayPal store it centrally.
If Google/PayPal get hacked your card info could be compromised.

But in reality the technical possibilities don't help a current consumer.  Once people have developed the needed software using bitcoin it will be another story. 
@_date: 2015-03-09 22:38:12
I think the point is that this is a guide/review for consumers today, not weighing their merits in the theoretical future. I'm glad they are including bitcoin at all in opposed to just leaving it out because it is different.
@_date: 2015-03-09 22:49:06
1) Because they don't, your card info is stored on a chip on the phone.
2) I agree, it should have been mentioned.
3) Charge backs do exist though and most credit card companies guarantee it if you get robbed/hacked. There is next to no similar recourse for bitcoin. Those fees affect merchants, not customers whom this is aimed at.
4) Doesn't really affect consumers unless merchants give a discount for using bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-09 22:41:13
But the reality of the situation is that this is not the case. This is a guide/review for consumers today, not in a theoretical future where the other services use bitcoin. I'm glad they included bitcoin at all to give people an idea of it's use and limitations in the present.

It is really the irreversibility of bitcoin transactions and the fact that bitcoins themselves are digital unlike fiat where it is some bank or company saying you are credited X amount of money. For example, if Bank of America gets hacked, what is the hacker going to do with the money? Transfer it to their BoA account? That obviously won't work and they'll get caught. Have it sent to an overseas account via money wire? That takes days to go through and BoA would know what account it is getting sent to and can stop it before it goes through etc. Try to withdraw it in cash at a physical bank? That would take a number of people working at the bank to be in on it to not get caught, also most physical banks don't have a huge amount of cash on hand. On the other hand, with bitcoin it is as easy as starting a transaction to an external wallet and within ~10minutes it is completely done and irreversible. There is also no way of connecting a bitcoin address to an individual unless they used it for an account with their name somewhere. It is also relatively easy to launder by splitting it up and sending it around to different addresses.

If you live in the USA and don't want to deal with money wires/orders, yes.

Absolutely, I'm tired of the memes, and the constant, "How/Where do I buy bitcoins", "I'm glad I bought bitcoins", "To the moon", etc. posts.

Price drop. The motivation of going to mBTC was bitcoins being worth ~$1000.

Why is a person's SSN required to verify identity? I think it is somewhat reasonable to be hesitant to give it out to a very new business that also would have access to our banking information. Sites like coinbase (which do accept US bank accounts) don't require a SSN.

It is probably easier to buy the coins on somewhere like [coinbase](
If you want to learn a little more about bitcoins check out [trybtc](
If you want a wallet client, try [multibit]( or [electrum](
@_date: 2013-11-28 05:13:48
First, read Coinbase's FAQ and the documentation with BitcoinQT, this is pretty basic stuff.
Find your address in your wallet, it will be a string of letters and numbers. Go to coinbase and send the amount you want to your computer wallet.
