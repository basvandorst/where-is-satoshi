It's just so weird for me to see you talking about bitcoin as if it were a stock.  To me a currency should be utility.  
Currently I think bitcoin is just money laundering.  


If you really believe that, more power to you.  But I think it's going to zero.  Eventually.

I've just described a scenario where the US is able to circumvent their debt through devaluing their currency.  
The rest of the world should reject it too.  I don't think the US should be able to go so far into debt and then weasel out of it in such a matter.
The way I've described it, I wouldn't be suprised if it is a fucking government plan.

It does have to be accepted in order for purchase of good and services. What currency is used for.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:17:00
I agree that would also be a concern.  But long term the amount of Debt the US owes is exponentially more than what would be collected in taxes and has the possibility for greater losses.
Edit: Besides they still have income tax.

Tread lightly. I'm quite sure it's going to zero because it won't be accepted by the vast majority of the public and world.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:35:11
The entire US economy is detached from reality.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:32:14
You fuckers that have bitcoin are of course going to down vote me, but guess what?
Your beloved currency is on a path to becomming worthless.
It's going back to zero.

Nah, the first world problem would be having Bitcoin, but not finding any place that I would want anything from accepting it.
Edit: The first world problem would be finding a place that would accept bitcoin that had something I wanted to buy.

YOU JUST LOST 50% OF WHAT IT WAS WORTH YESTERDAY. NO I'M NOT JEALOUS
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:23:47
Bitcoin is a fucking scam.
Run like hell kids!
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:36:08
It may be here to stay, but if it keeps dropping 50% a day it will also be worthless.
I'm not scared of bitcoin.  I understand it.  I just don't think that it will ever be compatible with our international political economy. 
All countries should reject bitcoin because it undermines nationalism, economics and shifts power into the hands of fewer people.
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:13:27
I see bitcoin as something different than the public.  It's like investing in a company with no assets and no revenue.  I wouldn't call it a currency.  I wouldn't call it equity.  
I'd rather have Colones.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:23:24
explain yourself
@_date: 2013-12-19 16:08:13
Reasons why I don't like Bitcoin:
1) I don't have any currently.  I have Canadian and US Dollars and plenty of them so I would hate to see those currencies devalued at the expense of bitcoin as I have worked hard for them.  I have never heard a reasonable argument for bitcoin by someone who has none.
2) I keep 2 Lucky Bills in my pocket.  A NZ $5 and an Aussie $5.  Bitcoin in your pocket has an entirely different meaning.
3) I think bitcoin runs the risk of tearing down the order of our international political economy if it becomes a legitimized currency.
4) The whole bitcoin mining thing is fucking dumb.  I try real hard to understand, but I just think its a fucking scam when I step back and look at the big picture.
5) I run a business.  If paypal says it's not a currency.  It's not a currency.
6) I don't get airmiles when I spend bitcoins.
7) I hate trying to explain it to people. 
I'm a reasonable person.  I get why all the people that have bitcoin want to see it work.  I hope you can understand why I don't like it and want to see it disappear

I still haven't an adequate explanation for my issue.

Bitcoin = capitalism unraveled

Why nations would want their currency devalued:
From this you can understand why China would dislike Bitcoin if the perceived value of US dollars decreases from the use of bitcoin.

Well in the real world where down votes are worth as much as up votes. I can tell you that you are the one who is retarded.
You obviously don't understand how the US is going to weasel its way out of debt through devaluing their currency.
@_date: 2013-12-19 20:23:41
Dear Bitcoin: If your cryptocurrency is worth what you say it is.  $717USD/mBTC.   It is a threat to governments of nations around the world regardless of what you say.
It will, or has the potential to upset the international order of things.  
If you disagree, please explain to me how it won't.

"the whole debt thing is just a "diplomatic issue", nobody really expects it to be payed"
Says the guy in the United States. 
The whole monetary system is at risk.  Maybe it's just my ability to forecast things before they happen.  But I see big problems for the US in Febuary when the debt ceiling needs to be raised again.
Maybe at somepoint nobody will want your debt.  That will cause an issue.

How the fuck would Target have 40,000,000 credit card numbers on file?
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:24:31
my point exactly!  Bitcoin is incompatible with the current economic order which will make the currency return to being worthless.
Sell and run like hell
Edit: It isn't so much as incompatible as it is implausible. Correct?
