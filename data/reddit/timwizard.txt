Presentation was today and passed. Basically, he was promoting the "bitlicense" that NY would give. He also gave examples of some of the marketing material of exchanges and other bitcoin institutions as being "insured", etc, when there isn't actually any financial insurance mechanism in place.
Basically, the point was that the industry is very young and these bitcoin companies are largely afraid of regulation, but the large insurers can help them navigate that and provide financial backing.

The way I've seen the escrow work is the buyer is told to memorize a 5 letter code, or write it down or whatever. Then once the transaction is complete, the seller releases the funds (via the website, SMS, whatever) and then the coins are sent and the seller is given the code. The seller tells the buyer, confirming to the buyer that the coins were sent. No action required from buyer.
