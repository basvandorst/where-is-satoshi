Anyone in business knows they must do this, it's a legal requirement of doing business that all company letterheads, websites and business cards must have company name, address and telephone number.

..and now you can blame Bitfinex too!  You can complain all you want about the government but it's absolutely proven now that exchanges are corrupt as fuck, clueless about security and cannot protect themselves and their customers - Bitfinex has sealed the deal on that front, you can fully expect aggressive regulation everywhere from this point forward, only those that are 'accountable' and run their operations properly will survive.

In the jurisdictions they have customers, and over a third of their customers are U.S. based.  Given his fumbled response I wouldn't trust what you see on LinkedIn.

* Let's join the dots, because.. Bob
* Bitfinex funded ShapeShift
* Bob hacked ShapeShift (if you believe the grand story that's full of holes)
* ShapeShift is good friends with Bitfinex
* Eric Voorhees is good friends with Bitfinex
* Bitfinex is hacked
* Some security people believe ShapeShift hack was inside job
* Bitfinex most certainly looks like an inside job
* Bitfinex CSO freudian slip ...Bob...
* Is Eric in on the Bitfinex inside job?
* Was Bitfinex CSO in on ShapeShift hack?
* Did Bitfinex CSO get his scripts mixed up?
* Who is the real CEO of Bitfinex?

Yes, it's called accountability and it's a good thing.

Brain wallets are a bad bet, the average person's vocabulary falls somewhere between 10k - 20k words, an extremely smart person's might be up to 30k.  That's a very small dictionary to attack.

It's simple really, anyone that still trusts Bitfinex is a fucking idiot.  And do not trust the whales or be influenced by them either, they're also a bunch of shitheads that will happily fuck you over for profit.

Day 11 and not a single word from whoever is in charge of this joke of an exchange.

The big question in my mind is how did they arrive at 36%?  In order to get there they must have all the numbers calculated and written down, yet they aren't showing them.  Why?

* Listen from 27:40
* Who's in charge of Bitfinex?
* Baahba b js lk th err ay I'm not the CEO, what do you want me to tell you?
* Well, he wants you to tell him who's in charge.  The question was clear.
* This is very revealing, the avoidance of questions and the amount of "I don't know" and "I'm not the right guy" is beyond belief.  Who's in charge is a very simple question.  But let me ask again... Who's in charge? Who is on the team?  Which individuals are dealing with which issues and which jurisdiction are they in?  What's the official address? Because lawyers need to know, they need to serve you with some papers.
* Did you notice there is no company and team info on the website?
* Did you know it's a legal requirement for a company to provide that information?
* Bitfinex is unquestionably the shadiest company I have ever come across.
* Law enforcement should be all over these people, but can they can find them?

Correct, except it's not safe, it has bugs, and veracrypt is a fork of 7.1a.  It's also not safe if you have thunderbolt and firewire ports active, or sleep and hibernate - veracrypt should implement some type of DMA port blocking / disabling.  Remember keys are in memory, and there are ways to get them.  Even USB keys aren't that safe, they're only as safe as the firmware.  Have you inspected the firmware?  Oh, and do you ever plug your cellphone into your laptop?  You probably shouldn't do that.

Google it, I'm not your bitch.  It's very easy to find.

Well, hidden OS and containers are a lot safer than Bitlocker, that's a fact - but only IF the open source code has been audited by competent independent experts - and it hasn't.  Bitlocker is frighteningly easy to compromise, so your best option might be a fully encrypted Linux USB install.  Just remember to never leave it alone, and disable your thunderbolt and FireWire ports if you have them and never use sleep or hibernate.  OPSEC is the most important part of disk encryption that frequently gets overlooked.

Send this back to "Stephen" - So pathetic, when are your cowardly executives going to have the balls to speak instead of sending their monkeys?  In fact, who are your executives?  Who is in charge of your organization?  All this time and not  a word from the CEO or CFO.  Their names are shit, they are cowards, and the Bitfinex name is shit.

Given they've proven they're insecure they should probably remove that dumb claim.

Why would you keep coins in a place "proven" to be insecure?  No cure for stupid I guess.

I think [he's referring to this]( and fortunately a good proportion of people here have brains and they can decide for themselves after hearing it.  Fact is you're not being transparent Zane so don't complain about what people are saying.  You can easily alleviate this problem by releasing your accounts and showing proof.

Yep, if you get found with cash at the border they'll take it.  No justification required, other than you have cash.  Welcome to uhmmerrica, no money allowed.  But oh well, better than South uhmmerrica, where if you don't give cops money they'll shoot you dead or hack off a limb.
