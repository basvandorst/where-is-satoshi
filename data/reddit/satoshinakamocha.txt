It just depends on what your goal is.
@_date: 2018-02-06 12:54:11
It really is though if you want it to be a currency.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:52:42
I don’t.
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:57:43
I think the joke went over your head

Lol after a 7 year bull market...if it crashed like 2008 levels I’m putting all my money back into stocks
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:12:01
I didn't say they couldn't. I'm just saying you think the people that would exit the market over at 3.5% dip would head to crypto?!? I'm not saying it cant be apart of a healthy portfolio.
@_date: 2018-02-17 09:40:08
Your shilling to your own family?!?

I don't. But i do take my money seriously.

Welcome to the market. 
@_date: 2018-02-23 03:57:54
I’m out for the moment. (Have been since I sold @ 15k) Right now bitcoin/crypto is not filling the gap I thought it would be. I really liked the p2p electronic currency aspect. But I have been conviently using venmo, and square cash in the way I wish bitcoin functioned. The only thing I really love about it now is the deflationary aspect of it. I also like blockchain technology but it’s use cases are being so overblown. I do want back into crypto(I do love it) just not in the current state.
@_date: 2018-02-01 23:26:01
HODL that shit like Enron stock!
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:17:14
I made money on bitcoin I hit my stop loss at 15k. I understand the tech...
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:09:41
The s&amp;p 500 is down 3.5% this month. You think that because of that they would flee to an asset that has had up to 60% drops in that same time frame? If there exiting the stock market I bet there staying in cash

Its so hard to take this sub serious.

It’s a free market. He can do as he pleases. That’s the beauty of it. Even if it is not great for us.
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:42:14
Things I have realized it doesn’t matter how many businesses accept it because even if it’s avalabile and people have it they don’t spend it. They just hodl and speculate on future price. Best we can hope for is store of value or maybe for massive purchases.
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:13:46
Ok I checked. Up 24 points.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:14:48
Bitcoin forked off of beanie babies 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:45:28
Looks like it’s finding support

Bulls make money, bears make money, pigs get slaughtered. There’s a huge potential to lose when you are chasing greed
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:11:45
lol S&amp;P 500 futures are down 0.7 %. That is literally nothing. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:48:41
Because its already overvalued compared to its current use cases. Maybe if they introduce a bitcoin ETF. I’m not saying it’s not going higher I’m saying I think we’re done with 1000% years
@_date: 2018-02-25 03:29:58
Tell that to the billions of dollars invested. We might not be a currency. But we are a professional gambling network. ALL IN.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:33:37
I wouldn’t mind it holding around this levels for a while. Until there is adoption or new tech.
@_date: 2018-03-05 04:59:32
Or maybe it was, Welcome to perspective.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:08:44
At this point in time it’s hard to see bitcoin being a medium of exchange. So volatile. Will probably just end up as an asset to tie up money in.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:03:40
666 points ain’t shit.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:39:34
It’s still overvalued for its current use cases.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:48:59
Why is the consensus that only one can exist...
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:25:34
What’s the point of this post?
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:53:43
I don’t think adoption is the main issue though. I think people just don’t like spending something that could earn them money 
@_date: 2018-02-09 10:00:33
You could hedge 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:07:47
There needs to be more adoption before 50k IMO. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 01:02:37
I did yesterday TBH. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:37:20
I know I am. I’ve theres one thing I hate in this world it’s small blogs

The same things were said a month ago
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:02:39
Has to be relavent first.
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:38:22
I think we are done with exponential growth. And it’s probably a good thing. I’m hoping it will test 20k again by the end of the year. And stay on a steady growth pattern as tech emerges and we see higher levels of adoption.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:28:45
Just like all assets classes rn
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:48:12
Right now? Hype. In the future hopefully ease of use, mass adoption, privacy, Trust-less systems, Low fees, among many other things.
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:57:31
I'm so torn because I love crypto but I can't stand these GPU prices.

SHHHH!!! GBTC has been my bread and butter:)
@_date: 2018-02-24 01:01:26
All you did is trade shady banks for shady exchanges. I have never seen more exit scamming, pump and dump products, misinformation campaigns then i have being in the crypto space. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:07:27
I wouldn’t advise this to most in the crypto or investing space. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:01:09
Why do you think bitcoin would weather the economic downturn any better. If the bubble popped and debts have to be payed crypto will me sold off aswell. And the people buying it will be the rich.
@_date: 2018-02-09 15:34:17
Nobody knows what the endgame is for bitcoin. I'm hoping it ends as a currency. But adoption isn't really taking off.
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:25:04
Yeah i would say its in a massive bubble compared to its current use/function. I mean right now the only thing i can do with my bitcoin locally is i can buy coffee. Yes it is overvalued right now. But if adoption comes along and it can start being used more easily and at more places then today's prices are massively undervalued. Only time will tell
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:05:58
I don’t think there inverse. And I think lots of people have different ideas for what they want btc to be. While you won’t see crypto dominating my investment portfolio. It is a valuable asset to have a stake in.
@_date: 2018-02-05 11:06:00
They can take any action that they deem necessary right now they can limit the icos. It doesn’t mean they won’t take on the market later 
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:51:38
I think it will end up being somewhere in between aswell
@_date: 2018-02-08 21:50:52
While I don’t think that it will be what people flip 2. I love the idea of new investors not fearing market dips. And looking for the long term. On the flipside I hope they don’t expect these 1000% gains
@_date: 2018-02-09 20:13:51
Long blockchain. Formerly Long Island iced tea Corp. also Kodak 
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:16:38
Bitcoin is speculative and volatile. It makes sense that they wouldn’t want you to purchase it on credit. I bet a lot of people bought in at 18k and defaulted on payments. Just use debit 
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:42:05
It also takes away the privacy aspect to some extent.
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:00:30
Btc’s market cap is only 138b. I don’t think it’s affecting the market

The Dow is up and the government is not shutdown 
@_date: 2018-02-13 15:36:31
Fair enough.
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:49:59
I agree with you on almost all points except for a large portion of the community it’s going to be hard to convince them to spend something that’s gaining value. The community sentiment is already HODL.
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:31:50
I do not think this is the case... you still have to buy bitcoin with fiat. Those with more fiat can buy more btc.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:17:04
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:40:09
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:34:29
Idk what experiences you have had with banks all of mine have been positive or neutral. I think people’s problem with banks comes when they try to borrow for what they cannot afford
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:03:22
2% downturn and you think people are fleeing the stock market?
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:18:49
Just because it’s on the market does not mean it’s untouchable.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:49:19
This is not good for bitcoin. I have been out since 15k. And I’m still LONG crypto &amp; block chain potential just not in btc 
@_date: 2018-02-07 11:05:12
They actually don't know.
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:03:08
When it continually gains value people don’t see it as a currency ethier.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:03:13
Dayum. In what?
@_date: 2018-02-13 19:42:59
You act like the government hasn’t done crazier things
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:14:41
Your saying a 20% dip will ruin lives in the Dow but a 60% bitcoin dip won’t?!? Where is your logic?
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:52:25
It’s not though. Even if it was I wouldn’t care I have a long term outlook on my investments 
@_date: 2018-02-17 22:22:47
I laughed out loud. And cringed in silence
@_date: 2018-02-05 12:52:08
Cryptos are not the entire blockchain industry...
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:23:46
If it is gaining value then it’s a lot harder to spend it today if it will be worth more tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:29:37
I’m not saying it was never used. Or never will be. I’m sure it was probably spent more during that era/ Silk Road/ dark markets then it has since it has become an asset class.
@_date: 2018-02-13 12:30:44
I’m saying I see it’s future as an asset class and not a currency.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:57:09
Lol what? I have made 13% today in stocks.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:05:38
It has a long way to go before that happens
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:56:15
As far as people using it as a currency?! 20-30. Hodl’ers? Maybe the rest
@_date: 2018-02-14 23:55:51
Happy? No. But I still would be hodling. I feel as though I did solid due diligence before I invested. There's not a whole lot that could convince me to sell at this point.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:13:58
I’m saying they both ruin lives I’m not saying anything about a recession 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:59:03
Someone ban this guy. Constant shitposting 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:16:17
Yes it is in a bubble. Like most other assets. It does have incredible potential though.
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:57:05
It’s nowhere near the adoption levels we need to see though. Most are investors and HODLing fewer then you might think are using it as currency 
@_date: 2018-02-15 00:06:57
It's there 2nd biggest investment behind apple. I have no idea what they see in that bank....
@_date: 2018-02-05 10:13:20
I have no idea what your trying to convey. They will buy the dip on quality companies that have dropped not flee to crypto.
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:57:19
We also have more dollars comparatively.
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:53:15
If there’s anything Japan knows it’s bubbles.
