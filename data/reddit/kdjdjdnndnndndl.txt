Don't see how that saying is even a thing lol. $10 the next day would still equal $5/day. His loss, at least the idea is in his head now

Think you may be talking about bitfinex. Even though I wouldn't necessarily want them to have scans and selfies, it's what you have to do. You really think that trying to take them to court, paying a lawyer, revealing yourself in the end anyway is a better route than solving it right now for free? Doubt they will release the funds to you off of just an email, what would stop me from emailing them like "give me access to this whales account I'm going to sue" what?

Read more like the page after you confirmed the removal. From what I remember, when I removed mine it was a 2 week waiting period to take it off. They text / email you asking if you really want to take it off (to prevent hijackers from simply clicking a disable button) look around on the site and contact support.

Y'all think I could just slap security researcher in my Twitter bio and get an interview from Fox News?

I saw a post a bit ago similar to this, are you using the blockchain.info wallet? Is it actually giving you the invalid password error or is the site just not responding after you verify your email?

What arm thing homie?

If you have a sizable amount you should consider a hardware wallet like trezor. In your scenario, you are trusting coinbase will continue keeping your (their) BTC safe as well as you keeping your email, passwords, and 2fa safe

Welcome. Make sure you store your holdings in a secure way

Time will tell, friend. A lot of people dreamed about Bitcoin hitting 10k one day. Some might sell, others may still believe in more. A lot of people also have just bought in for the first time at 10k and won't be happy parting with it for less.

Nobody knows. A lot of people thought they'd announce it at their q4, they didn't. After, their legal team registered some crypto related domains, although they did that years ago too. I think eventually they will at least make a yes / no answer on it. Personally, I believe they will accept some form of crypto. They have big $. If they even talk about crypto in a good way, you can expect the price to fly up

I'll check when I wake up. There was a tutorial on how to make your own, as well as some group that sold ones before but were sold out when I saw. I'll try to update because I'd also like one

I've kept mine at 1:1. Sure I could have made a bit more btc/overall value swapping Bch:btc but oh well. I'll still probably hold it 1:1 in the future too

Steam like the gaming company? they accept Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-09-29 05:06:12
New people into BTC around me have gone with the trezor. It's very easy to learn the features of it, their software is open source, and it's pretty damn reliable imo. Good luck man! Be safe

When I did it a year or two ago it was either 7 or 14 days. Contact support or look on their site, the answer will be on there

Those people in my opinion will keep whatever they feel comfortable trading with on the exchange. The reason I stopped using 3rd party sites / online wallets / exchanges to hold BTC, it was a constant fear that one day I might check some crypto news and see the exchange/service I used was taken down/hacked/coins were taken. I was also trusting that my email, and 2fa were secure. Otherwise they could just reset if they knew some info about me. The idea is just to be safe with your coins. You can only do so much to keep your exchange accounts secure, then the rest is up to them not to run / get hacked / whatever else could go wrong on their end. Having a hardware wallet gave me a lot of piece of mind. If you plan to use exchanges, even for low amounts.. Just enable Google 2fa (sms not really preferred, can be compromised) it could be the difference to you keeping / losing your money
Same goes for your email :)
