The fundamentals of Bitcoin are as strong as ever. Nothing has changed at all in that regards. I'm very pleased to see that MtGox got boxed. We got rid of a cancer, and the whole deal shed some light on important topics: some bugs were fixed, more reputable companies are filling in the void, the core Bitcoin devs are getting more support, and people are (hopefully now) understanding the risks of leaving money in the hands of others. We all love unregulated markets here, but we need to understand the personal responsibility that comes with it.

Don't invest more than you can afford to lose. People who invested all their savings were driven by greed and blinded by greed. Besides it's not lost until you cash out, and *if* Bitcoin hits &gt;$1000 again (I believe it will), it's not hype. BTW, I had money on MtGox too.

This is actually what attracted me to Bitcoin. I was sick of filling out so many forms.

In that case you'd want to invest in a less risky way. For example, buy Bitcoin on an exchange and transfer it directly out to cold storage, i.e. don't leave it on the exchange.

How about water? Copper? Etc.
@_date: 2014-10-31 13:53:38
[Copper is an essential trace element (i.e., micronutrient) that is required for plant, animal, and human health. It is also required for the normal functioning of aerobic (oxygen-requiring) microorganisms.]( Without water or copper we wouldn't even be having this discussion. So if we value life then water and copper have intrinsic value. 
Furthermore, if we value commerce between two parties for the reason that it makes life easier to exist, then money has intrinsic value as well. Therefore, bitcoin AND fiat have intrinsic value. They are tokens of value that bind independently existing "living" systems. 
Of course if we say that NOTHING matters, then I would agree that nothing has intrinsic value. I'm assuming life does matter.
@_date: 2014-06-04 14:28:59
Similar way as USD. As it's value decreases, you increase the price. As Bitcoin's value increases, you decrease the price.

Hi Jimmy,
With Bitcoin, you could add some amazing features to Wikipedia going well beyond just another channel for donations. With its microtransaction nature you could automate things such as bounties, spam protection, anonymous and international payments or redistribution of funds. I'm sure some fellow redditors here can come up with some more cool ideas too.
@_date: 2014-11-09 21:25:26

Man, I know the feeling. Don't worry about them. Once you lower your expectations from your family you'll be a much happier person. It's not about being right or wrong. Everyone has their own ideas.
@_date: 2014-10-20 14:51:31
no late fees, no bank owns your money, easier transactions, international transactions, smaller fees, programmable, micropayments, just to name a few. I would suggest you get some BTC and spend it. The experience will teach you a lot.
@_date: 2014-03-06 12:43:09
Yes it does. Satoshi called them to get rid of the reporter.
@_date: 2014-11-25 19:07:37
How did you get fiat? Working, gifts from family, selling something. You can obtain BTC in the same exact way and people do. Obtaining BTC and fiat both require effort. 
OP's point however is that "assuming you have the currency", bitcoin is easier to spend, so try not to get off topic.
@_date: 2014-11-25 19:03:28
My suggestion would be for you to get some Bitcoin and try it for yourself, and be the judge yourself. Having said that, I mostly had in mind using credit cards on sites and the form you need to fill out, hoping you did it all correctly and it will be accepted. 
I won't even consider comparing to PayPal because PayPal is horrible in my opinion. Horrible website, horrible customer service, and a record of freezing people's accounts which amounts to legalized highway robbery.

As the lead dev of [XChange]( I've had a few conversations with him as well. Of all the exchange API's I've dealt with, theirs was the worst. Hugely bloated JSON, very poor and outdated docs, and they'd change their APIs randomly with no prior warning at all. From the perspective of maintaining XChange, I'm glad their gone. From other perspectives too.
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:38:37
You should definitely check out [XChange]( for interfacing with the exchanges for market data. Once you learn how the API is structured, adding more exchanges to your app is trivial. XChange does all the heaving lifting for you.

Your rant and recent others in r/bitcoin about Mt.Gox are starting to make me suspicious that there are some people working for another exchange trying to scare people away from Mt. Gox. I've never had a problem with them and never was blocked when making a withdrawal. Please show proof of Mt. Gox's denial and give more details about the amount of BTC you were trying to withdraw. What specifically is it, or lack thereof, in Mt. Gox's terms and conditions that you have an issue with? 
@_date: 2012-07-17 05:03:02
No, that's not my point. My point is that it's good to think like a scammer to prevent oneself from being a victim of a scam. If you would have thought like a scammer, you would not have lost your $400. See my point? Think like a scammer, don't **be** a scammer.

Yes! 
That's the reaction I was hoping for. I think it would help the Bitcoin economy greatly. Go ahead and post it in If we all put something up for bid, it's the start of going from the mite to the whale. Even a mouse would be fine. It doesn't matter what site people use, just so that there is at least one place that can get the ball rolling for Bitcoin. I just think bitmit has everything in place, and it functions as I recently discovered. Bitbid looks good though as well, except for almost nothing for sale on it.
@_date: 2012-01-21 15:03:38
what programming language is it written in?
@_date: 2012-12-18 21:26:05
 isn't always true. Say I want to transfer $30,000 from a US account to a European account and have it in Euros. A foreign wire costs $25. Transferring it with Bitcoin through Mt.Gox for example with 0.6% fees would cost $360. If it was cheaper to do it with BTC, I would. I also don't know if I trust Mt.Gox with $30,000. In fact, no, I don't at all.
@_date: 2012-06-15 08:27:07
MIT license. Yup, the idea is that implementing additional exchanges should be straight forward. It is designed so that once a new exchange is implemented, querying data from it is exactly the same as querying data from other implementations. 
For example for MtGox:
    Exchange mtGox = ExchangeFactory.INSTANCE.createExchange("com.xeiam.xchange.mtgox.v1.MtGoxExchange");
    PollingMarketDataService marketDataService1 = mtGox.getPollingMarketDataService();
    Ticker ticker = marketDataService1.getTicker(Currencies.BTC, Currencies.USD);
And now from a different one:
    Exchange differentOne = ExchangeFactory.INSTANCE.createExchange("com.xeiam.xchange.differentone.v1.DifferentExchange");
    PollingMarketDataService marketDataService2 = differentOne.getPollingMarketDataService();
    Ticker ticker = marketDataService2.getTicker(Currencies.BTC, Currencies.USD);
The returned Ticker object is the same across all exchanges:
    public final class Ticker {
    
    private final BigMoney last;
    private final BigMoney bid;
    private final BigMoney ask;
    private final String tradableIdentifier;
    private final long volume;
    private final DateTime timestamp;
    ...
    }
It's just the implementation behind the scenes that is unique to each exchange. To add another exchange, one just needs to add a new module and implement the defined API. Most of the grunt work involves defining the HTTP queries and parsing the returned JSON and mapping it to the XChange DTOs, such as the Ticker object above.

I watched one of your videos the other day and my main criticism would be that the car looks like a death trap. It also looks like a very uncomfortable and noisy ride. Nothing more than a really expensive go cart.
You said that it could get 100 mpg, and from what I could tell, the only reason for that is it's lightweight and aerodynamic. I hope you can prove me wrong, but I think that once you add everything to the car that will make it safe and comfortable like a real suspension, a roof and windows, a safe frame and everything else that makes practical driving bearable, you will not have the weight savings anymore. 
I guess I don't really have a question, but could you maybe address my concerns?

Bitcoin doesn't need the Bitcoin Foundation. It almost seems more like a vehicle for self-promotion of its member's agendas to me. The only value I see is the money it has to fund core developers like Gavin. The foundation should send a clear message (Satoshi's) that Bitcoin's power and value is in decentralization by dissolving itself. Put the left over money in a fund for core development.

I was wondering the exact same thing, and I think it'sbecause of partial fills.

Some of the smaller fills are so small that on the chart they appear as 0.000, but in fact they are 0.00003568 BTC or something really small like that.

I suggest you that you get some Bitcoin, even a small amount and purchase something. After you use it, you will see its brilliance and utility.

* p2p distributed ledger, no centralized point to attack/control
* copy, paste, send. Cannot be easier to use

* allows exciting new technologies and services that are being developed right now

Another reason, small and mid-cap companies should start using Bitcoin is to give themselves a technical advantage over their competitors. Think of the micro-payments space. Or image if these companies created APIs and let external developers like me and/or internal developers create apps on top of their API. Suddenly, new things are possible that the competitors cannot offer. That's huge! From a technical point of view, integrating a payment system like Bitcoin into a system is orders of magnitude simpler than say credit card systems. I created a weekend project a while back ( to prove to myself how easy it would be, and I was truly shocked. Bitcoin opens the door to a universe of new apps that are just waiting to be developed and monetised.

@_date: 2013-02-02 11:21:52
What language is it written in? I'm interested in rolling it into [XChange](
@_date: 2013-11-06 12:20:31
Just don't discuss the USD value of Bitcoin. Rather, talk about what Bitcoin is, how easy it is to use, and why you like it.
@_date: 2013-01-25 13:32:06
Thanks for the info. I'm excited now for November!

I had 2 kings I believe. Dealer had 18 (3 cards)
@_date: 2013-10-26 20:46:33
try the bitcoinium app for Android. It has a cavirtex ticker.
@_date: 2013-11-28 19:24:07
Damn. That sucks. I wish they had a list of valid countries listed on their website.
@_date: 2013-04-24 12:24:07
Wow, that's probably the best pitch for bitcoin I've seen so far. I'm sending that out to my German-speaking family members.
@_date: 2013-12-01 15:01:05
Yes, that's correct. The problem is that my balance is 0.000. It should be 1.000 mBTC.
@_date: 2013-11-30 10:49:39
[bitcoinium.com]( has a mBTC option now too.
@_date: 2013-11-21 12:43:20
Not for conducting electricity or making jewelry.
@_date: 2013-10-25 08:27:25
I emailed their support a few hours ago and still haven't heard a thing. I noticed the "1000 transactions per API request" thing too the other day.
@_date: 2013-11-13 07:42:58
You need to advertise and let the world know about your site. You can get some results here:

Honest question: Where do you see this lag? Where is it published?
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:25:31
Thanks for the feedback. Yes, I'll get the recent trades in there some way or another. I want to make sure I do it with minimum bandwidth as I intend this site to be very mobile friendly - especially for mobile phones with limited data plans.
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:31:38
Agreed. The volume today is more normal. Last week the market was going bonkers, hence higher volume.
@_date: 2013-04-10 12:27:06
Yes, indeed. I'll come up with something elegant soon.

A transfer from a US account to a french account via an international wire will be around $25. That would be waaaaay cheaper then doing USD --&gt; BTC --&gt; EUR. The thing is, you need a French account, which I don't think would be too hard to get, especially if you're there in person. You'd need a French account anyway to put your Euros into after converted from BTC.
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:34:21
yup, me too.

I would highly recommend MultiBit. I also have a Mac and tried the qt client at first, but luckily switched to MultiBit soon afterwards.
@_date: 2013-12-04 12:40:44
[ is another one. Works well on a mobile device too.
@_date: 2013-05-01 20:18:15
Is this an open source app by chance?
@_date: 2013-10-14 15:14:48
Yes, agreed. Right now we've only implemented the ability to check balances on public Bitcoin addresses, but all that other stuff would be great to have as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 08:21:49
[bitcoinium.com]( already has mBTC as an option.
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:44:42
Thanks. Glad you like it so far. Come back in a few days, as there should be some improvements by then. Cheers!
@_date: 2013-11-02 17:40:08
I also got one of those cookie-cutter emails too in response to a specific question I had about verifying my credit card. That was pretty disappointing. It took them 8 days to reply too! Other than that, it's been alright.
@_date: 2013-11-08 13:10:25
That sounds like a good idea. I'm not sure about the RNG, but I think the source code for it is here: 
You could also consider using an old netbook and USB device after secure erasing them, reformatting, and in the case of the netbook, reinstalling the OS.

user6524 Looking forward to trying it out!
@_date: 2013-04-10 10:01:09
Try [bitcoinium.com]( as a temporary alternative. I just launched it yesterday so i might be a bit rough on the edges yet. For example, there is no long-term historical data yet. 
@_date: 2013-12-13 21:53:52
Because it's a bad idea, and he's just asking for trouble for selling litecoin on eBay, despite what that eBay dude is saying.
@_date: 2013-03-05 08:21:01
Hell yes! As an existing happy customer, I'm even now more happy. I'll be paying for the next services with Bitcoin! Thank you!
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:44:14
Awesome. Thanks!

Vienna? What's going on there? I'm close to Vienna.
@_date: 2013-02-19 11:23:08
Yup, I just ran into the same problem. After logging out, I cannot even log back in now. :(
@_date: 2013-04-03 14:09:18
Could be someone wanting to invest a large sum of money into Bitcoin, and they're doing a DDOS attack in hopes the price falls because of it.

Try your luck with OpenExchangeRates. I just integrated their API into XChange:

I'd like you to know one reason why I love Bitcoin, but a reason that people don't always mention: because it's so easy to buy something with Bitcoin. If you have used Bitcoin already, you already know this fact, but if not, here are the steps:
On computer:  
1. copy  
1. paste  
1. enter amount  
1. hit send  
Or from cell phone:  
1. scan QR code  
1. enter amount  
1. hit send  
 
No bank account needed, no credit cards needed, no paper work, no filling in forms with your address and all that.
@_date: 2013-11-21 07:38:38
You are correct. That was announced around 6 months ago. Still good news though!
@_date: 2013-12-02 21:26:28
cool. Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2013-11-20 22:29:56
Right now the biggest "eBay of Bitcoin" is BitMit.net. It's being sold right now. I bought a MacBook on Bitmit for 90 BTC about a year and a half ago when it was about $7.50 per coin. They even have an escrow service, which I've used, and I like it. I heard Etsy is promoting or at least supporting their sellers in offering BTC as a payment. Other than that, people have been creating their own websites to sell their goods via Bitcoin or adding Bitcoin Merchant tools like BitPay to their existing sites.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:55:01
My advice is to really really take your time to understand Bitcoin and the risks before converting $100k. Yes, it's possible and will work out if done correctly, but you can easily fuck up and lose it all if you're not careful.
@_date: 2013-04-02 14:32:18
But that's what his IT department told him!!!
That was hilarious.
@_date: 2013-11-22 11:30:10
This is just my opinion... For all the early adopters, the risk of acquiring Bitcoin was much bigger than it is today, as far as ROI. It could easily have gone to a worth of $0. But what they believed in was the **idea** of Bitcoin not just a means of making a profit. The brilliant idea of Bitcoin is still just as relevant today, but the risk is greatly reduced now given years of validation and continued interest and growth in **using** Bitcoin. From my point of view, Bitcoin is still in the early stages and has a long way to grow yet. The train is not long gone at all. If I were you, I'd get some BTC at Coinbase, and spend some of it. Educate yourself first and then see what **you** think!
@_date: 2013-01-07 10:49:59
When was bitcoin $33 in June 2012?!? Aside from that, wow, what a biased presentation of Bitcoin.

What printer do you have and what's that software?

One of my friends mentioned he saw this the other day while his kids were watching TV. He said you know it's getting mainstream when they are teaching it to the kids!

As a consumer, I seek out places that accept Bitcoin and give them my business. If Starbucks accepted Bitcoin and Tully's did not, for example, I would go to Starbucks. As a consumer, I like using Bitcoin for a plethora of reasons, and I look forward to the day when I can get rid of my credit card. Every day, more and more people like me are seeing the convenience of Bitcoin, which means there are going to be more and more people seeking out businesses accepting Bitcoin to spend money for goods and services.
A stopped using eBay all together about 5 years ago because I HATE Paypal with a passion. When I closed my account at both eBay and PayPal, I politely told them the reasons why. It's just my way of "voting with my money". If eBay started accepting Bitcoin, they'd have me back in a heartbeat. I know I'm just one person, but I can't be the only one thinking this way.
@_date: 2013-11-10 10:11:34
That's a good idea. I didn't know printers like that exist.
