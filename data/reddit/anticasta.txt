So Monero is mixing, just like Dash ? Then I prefer NAV with its second encrypted blockchain.

I wonder why people in crypto behave like retarded little children. I thought crypto was about making a better world but I don't see that happening with so many childish egocentric fighting people in this community.

It is really crazy. 2 years ago I tried to get people in crypto. Some listened, other didn't. But the funny part is that those that didn't listen, listened recently. They bought just before the bubble popped or after the bubble popped and are all at loss now.

Competition is a good thing. Just assuming that Bitcoin way is the only way is a bit retarded. There is room enough for multiple currencies to thrive.

He received 100 BTC. That's worth a lot currently but he is not rich yet. Bitcoin has to recover from this crash and then he will be rich again.

It gets even better. Nobody is going over his price so now he is buying coins :-) If I would have like 1000 bitcoins, I would sell him 140 at once to teach him a lesson.

If the ETF gets approved then Bitcoin will go to 3000-5000 $. Of course people don't care about buying at 1200 $.

Indeed, that's why I didn't jump into it. No news, no jumping in.

Haha, he is trying to sell his coins now with his fake wall. He realized his mistake. Dumb whale XD

The USD is the world reserve currency so they can.

What the hell are you posting, man ? LOL. This makes no sense at all. Do you even know how POS works ?

I read on cointelegraph lightning is going to be here today. So only segwit is needed which is here tomorrow. And strange enough price tanks today ...

They made 1 good prediction and based on that they are now trying to FUD everyone into panic selling so they can buy cheap coins. Goldman Sachs is the devil. So never listen to what they say. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 08:00:18
What problems does it create ? 
@_date: 2017-08-22 12:34:20
You see. Bitcoin is back above its 4000 $ resistance. Never trust Goldman Sachs. A few weeks ago they said investors should take Bitcoin serious now. So they want a piece of the cake. That's why this 2200 $ FUD prediction was launched by them. 
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:41:03
I don't understand what you are trying to tell.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:59:45
Oh she works for Goldman Sachs ? Than I know price will not go under 3000 $.
@_date: 2017-08-22 07:58:06
If you make an order with price lower than market price, it will be taken care automatically for you :-)

And proof of work doesn't ? For me as a poor user staking coins is a better option than to spend the little money I have in paying high electricity and specialized mining and cooling hardware. I think Bitcoin would be more decentralized being POS. 
@_date: 2018-03-15 12:17:56
I think price will go down until it hits oversold in the daily RSI.

Is there a list of all dates on which the SEC will make a decision regarding pending BTC ETF decisions ?
