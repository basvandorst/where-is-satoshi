That's one of the reasons why the program tells you to write it down in case you lose it.

Here's the output for nearly 8 hours of collection:

It automatically saves the output when you close the program to "output_H_M_S.txt" in the current directory. Pretty cool stats! Enjoy.

Theoretically I could not know who he was and it would've still worked perfectly.
@_date: 2014-03-29 20:12:06
You bet.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:43:26
 You can now add a password/salt to your string. Does this help it out? I also made it so the colors have different values based on the orientation, but I'm not sure if that increases any entropy.
@_date: 2014-01-02 03:00:34
Alright, thanks for your help.
@_date: 2014-03-31 02:11:55
No, the orientation of the Rubik's cube is the passphrase. If you can't solve a cube, you can just buy a new one then use the program. As long as you can turn a face, you can use this!
@_date: 2014-04-02 15:56:40
No, I actually use Bitcoin on a regular basis so I actually enjoyed it.
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:18:25
Heh, puzzled.
@_date: 2014-03-31 17:14:20
Wouldn't the way you read the cube add more entropy? Serious question as this isn't my forté. The program tells you which way is to you and which way is to the right.
@_date: 2014-02-11 01:49:25
I've gotten 6 payments from 1Sochi and 1Enjoy so far.
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:55:19
Haha. It gained some popularity overnight it seems.
@_date: 2014-03-25 01:06:50
Okay, thanks. Now, do I use Settings-&gt;Cold Storage on Mycelium or can I just keep it on the main screen?
@_date: 2014-01-26 15:12:12
Honestly, this is too random to be worth chrunching for. There is no way for us to know what character you added after which location of the rule. There has to be some other hint besides that.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:14:48
I think I'll work on adding a password so it will increase the security of the cube.
@_date: 2014-01-02 02:52:44
If MBAM blocked the IP, that means it's suspicious, no? Just curious because the IP is owned (well lookup-owned) by a russian pianist.
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:11:54
tl;dr i was right you were wrong
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:49:25
That's what I was using but links still went to French.
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:05:16
Nice. I've been thinking about buying recently and I think now is a good time. Need to rebuy what I spent on Titanfall!
@_date: 2014-03-31 21:02:39
Correct, but a random person wouldn't know that, only you would.
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:20:29
Ah good, we know you won't have a problem with female thieves then.
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:58:35
[Here's the README]( (or just click the link in the OP).
The program randomly generates 39 moves for you to do on a Rubik's cube. The letters correspond to a clockwise turn if you were looking at that face. A tick (') corresponds with a counter clockwise turn.
The cube displayed helps you check whether or not you did your moves correctly. If those two do not match up, I recommend you solving the cube and then trying again.
Hope you guys enjoy. Send me a pull request if you have any suggestions/features!

Join their help chat, they're really helpful.
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:41:20
It really does, especially knowing that it was purchased with BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-29 18:19:03
7 whole potassiums.

However, wouldn't I have to restart my computer each time I want to spend my coins? Then I'd lose the qr code.
@_date: 2014-03-31 01:53:09
Seems legit.
@_date: 2014-01-26 15:19:12
Well banging your head multiple times on a keyboard is effective too, but you're doing this as a challenge. It's similar to generating a random strong 42 characters long and trying to brute it. There's no difference.
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:31:26
Thanks. What's wrong with blockchain.info? I used that because of their easy api.
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:09:33
I don't know if it matters, but the 39 can easily be changed by just adding two generations together. I chose 39 because that was how long my string was that I generated.
On top of that, do you happen to know how strong my generation is? I feel like it's really good, but that's probably just bias on my part.
@_date: 2014-03-17 00:20:51
Why do you want a PHP tipbot? 
@_date: 2014-03-30 17:30:47
Probably because I'm so attractive.
@_date: 2014-03-31 13:48:03
Thank you for calculating this for me as I would have been lost. Is there a final number you've decided on? Thanks :)
@_date: 2014-03-29 17:37:10
Good luck with that.
@_date: 2014-03-30 00:46:25
Sounds like an easy scam to set up, OP.
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:35:56

Looks like I'm a little late to the party, but guy here. It was truly a great experience knowing that I instantly got paid for my work with basically no fees.
I'm glad this was possible and I'd do it again any day.
@_date: 2014-04-02 15:58:17
We talked throughout the whole process in order to have clarity. Since it was a Python script, he could easily see what was going on and I explained everything along the way.
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:24:09
No, you don't have to write down anything if you keep your cube safe.
@_date: 2014-04-06 04:19:34
That is definitely true. I wouldn't use this for critical stuff, this was just a one day fun project.
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:14:20
Thanks! That's sad but true.
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:59:45
Welcome aboard, good time (in my opinion) to buy. Mind if I ask what the price was?
@_date: 2014-03-25 01:57:52
Thanks for the information. I just transferred to my mycelium wallet. I don't really have a spare computer to boot onto however but I think I'll survive for now.
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:13:13
And it was FANTASTIC.
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:13:13
Thanks! Hope you enjoy it.
@_date: 2014-03-30 15:26:41
Please don't leave me.
@_date: 2014-03-29 17:47:11
Thanks, that worked!
@_date: 2014-04-02 14:11:39
It's ok, I won't.
But, have you ever seen me and Batman in the same room? Not saying anything here...
@_date: 2014-03-31 15:08:18
I can't quite remember the new name for it, but coinchat.org used to do this.
@_date: 2014-03-09 22:31:59
Are you guys in the wrong thread?
@_date: 2014-01-15 03:49:45
I'm watching it now too. I wish they didn't mention bitcoin by name honestly.
@_date: 2014-03-18 03:34:58
What's a good reason to use this over something like Snapcard? Snapcard allows you to purchase things on any website with Bitcoins, not just a select few.
Genuinely curious.
@_date: 2014-03-31 18:49:48
The way to read the cube depends on the orientation however. Doesn't that increase it? So you have 24 extra options of what any given cube could be, correct?
Also, would adding a salt that the user gives increase the entropy for that passphrase? So (say) your cube reads ROBGYW you could salt that with 'reddit' and provide a different output.
@_date: 2014-03-29 19:34:51
Uh, si, gracias! Tengo un gato en mis pantalones.
@_date: 2014-03-31 03:17:53
Yeah, this could be used for any random password really. This doesn't really generate the private key, it just generates the passphrase FOR the private key. Let me know what you use it for!
@_date: 2014-03-09 21:35:22
Er, wrong thread?
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:16:41
Is there anything I can change to increase it? From what I can gather, more steps won't help.
@_date: 2014-04-05 22:55:42
I'm not really sure if I want to do anything past this as I'm not sure what else I could do. What are some more stats I could have? I just made this to check out some of the money flow of bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:31:21
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:51:03
I enjoy watching people panic sell.
@_date: 2013-12-21 21:52:04
Would you still like it? Use at your own risk.
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:57:49
Well I guess the scam is working...
@_date: 2013-12-07 03:29:52
The uninformed.
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:40:51
Once you install it (the script is open source so you can check it out), you can go here to test all of the different syntaxes:  (this may 404 soon because of traffic).
It works on (I hope) every site. Confirmed to work on eBay, reddit!, Amazon, and more!
eBay: 
Amazon: 
reddit: 
Enjoy! It uses  for the conversions. If you find any bugs or want to add something, let me know and I will start a github repo.
EDIT: Sadly, it doesn't work in the comments section of Reddit due to a Cross-Image Policy (?).
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:31:09
It's possible. I guess once that address is generated that person has a balance already.
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:17:29
What a great guy. Good job.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:46:48
I'm assuming workers have more time to follow the price and/or news.
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:02:00
Are you seriously begging on a charity thread?
@_date: 2013-12-15 18:56:46
If you laminate it &amp; put it in a safe in multiple areas I don't think you need any more than that.
@_date: 2013-12-14 19:49:49
What's the address? Can you give us a link with the transaction histories? Your computer probably is infected, or your iPhone somehow is.

My ego goes in cycles, cumulating with a massive bruise around new year's which heals up in spring. Internet has certainly helped with my peel, but it's also made it tougher. My banana wife doesn't like how tough it's become

That sucks, sorry. If you didn't have 2FA, sorry.

I really want to check it out in a VM... hm.
@_date: 2013-11-30 04:37:22
You should check out the free AWS servers. You can get a free web host for a year. By the way, there won't be a bug in your site since it's just text and a few images.

It's private though. Bummer.

You use an exchange (coinbase, mtgox, etc) to buy bitcoins with a payment option or you can use localbitcoins.com. Don't beg here.
@_date: 2013-12-15 23:20:04
 is a fiverr-like marketplace.

Yes, it's amazing! You can't bid on eBay but you can buy out.
@_date: 2013-12-08 01:00:59
You should be able to use [SnapCard]( to buy it but I recommend contacting them beforehand for a purchase that large.
@_date: 2013-12-22 23:22:58
What is it then? You can exchange money for coins and vice versa.
@_date: 2013-12-15 20:20:05
Vouch over here for Snapcard. Their customer support is great and the product works great. They use Amazon Prime and they give you up to 20 minutes to cancel products &amp; you can return them.
