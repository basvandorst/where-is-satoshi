Never lose faith in Bitcoin. You gonna get surprised anytime by it.

Is Bitcoin this guy's little sister?

I'm not very familiar with their exchange but the best advice I could give you is to try contact their support again and explain your full issue, explain them everything and try to contact them via Twitter/Facebook as well.

Your dad deserves some reward as well, glad you were able to make some money for yourself.

Bitcoin isn't a company and it depends on the exchange that you are using.

I would rather leave it to engineers, not something to be voted tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-28 10:53:42
If you would have invested by then I'm pretty sure you would have sold already.

The guy who changes his coin everyday on twitter?

You aren't the only guy who lost money from them and try posting it on proper sub, @_date: 2017-12-28 10:55:07
You got robbed, try speaking with your boss and family they will understand.

Is he some kind of Bitcoin hater or what?

Fees go to the miners.

Seems like we are past that time, it's under $9k again.

Don't try to look him in the eye, you wont be able to sleep at night.

Don't ever fall for this kind of advertisements, you can lose your house cause of these scam ads, try to ignore them.

Kinda satisfying point.

I don't know why Banks are after crypto now, they used to be pretty friendly a few months ago.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:24:07
8 months isn't really much, you are one lucky guy, now just keep holding and you will see some profits coming in.
