The instant physical delivery makes it harder to sustain a fractional reserve system sure, but -- we've already seen several bitcoin accounts providers run fractional reserve systems.

You don't understand how bitcoin works.  When the $.50 cents arrives in an address it is in a SEPARATE TRANSACTION.  Sure that is tainted, but the original UTXOs remain separate.  Sending stolen coins to an address does nothing to "taint" the UTXOs already controlled by that address.  Blacklists (of any sane person) list OUTPUTS (which trace back to a theft or something), not addresses.

If you keep in mind that fiat issuers have access to infinite dollars it's hard to make the argument there is greater disparity in bitcoin.  
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:34:46

Sometime I wear my shirt from the Law Enforcement Against Prohibition group (leap.cc) which says "Cops say legalize drugs ask me why", and a common response is the one you imply here - "I think this or that drug/medicine/plant extract that I enjoy should be legal but not those other ones that I don't like".  You're missing the point, think it through.  Consenting adults need to be given responsibility over what they do to themselves; adding a prohibition state, prison system, corrupting and demonizing police and boosting revenue for criminals will NEVER help the serious problems that drug abuse entails.

"so Timmy owns 4BTC"  &lt;--  already you missed all the idiots here.  The idiots saw "bitmex" on coinmarketcap and thought it was an exchange.  They leveraged against a number chosen by the house and lost everything.  Or they bought IOUs on a custodial platform which later "collapsed" in a faux-hack exit scam.  There are plenty of idiot-proof aspects, like checksums on addresses, but - nothing is idiot proof, with people like me around :D

Well there are plenty of ways to define "leading".  Certainly at 85% + of market capitalization, BTC is leading by that metric.  Number of TX per day also shows a clear lead to BTC.

Bitfinex offers loans in the form of leverage.  I suppose by CDs you are looking specifically for an interest return on a deposit, which is indeed hard to get in deposits denominated in bitcoin (notice it's also hard to get interest return on deposits denominated in gold), you will need to look at something like JoinMarket for that, or if you like scams there are plenty of other offerings ;)

"There can be only one", we might say if we refuse to look around us.  What we would see if we look around is that there is nothing at all which exists solely in the singular.  Your argument would also apply have applied to monetization of gold vs. silver, platinum, copper, etc.  Clearly it didn't work that way.  A healthy public coin ecosystem will always have plenty of coins to choose from.  Otherwise, have fun with the monotony of monocropping, monotheism, and monogamy (to paraphrase Terence McKenna) .  
@_date: 2016-10-14 14:37:18
One publicly verifiable transaction, yes.  Remember that nobody was ever able to make such a transaction with fiat.  Off chain TX are unlimited.  Private coins, that is those without a public chain, require all transactions to be off chain.  
@_date: 2016-10-06 14:08:47
Your conclusion has some validity but the reasoning is wrong.  Here's how: 
 
You claim fiat currency is only created "as loans".  This is nonsense.  If I print a million fresh 100 dollar bills, guess what - there is no debt, just the money - scott free.  If I then choose to loan them out, that's another story.  
This makes the whole "there's not enough money to repay" thing fall flat on its face.  There is always plenty of fiat, provided you are a fiat issuer - seeing as there is no limit to the interest and debt free currency you can create.

I also recommend bitaddress.org.  For the paranoid: verify you have the right page.  Put it on a usb stick and run it on an offline computer (inside a faraday cage of course) that you will later sink to the bottom of the ocean (on europa).  After the page generates an address, copy the privkey and go to "wallet details" tab.  Paste the privkey there.  It will give you many things like the privkey in hex form.  Take that and alter it any way you feel like (use dice or something).  Put the new altered privkey in and then use this to generate a keypair and address. Now save the privkey in a text file, encrypt it with gpg --symmetric if you like, or write it down somewhere and bury it, however you like to hodl.  Now drop the computer into a black hole and you should be good to go.

What an utter  waste of space.  Credit cards can work with any unit of account, bitcoins etc. without problem.  You're saying "fiber optic cables could never carry as much traffic as the internet".  Or maybe your point is that third party payment services have something to offer over dealing directly with hard cash; sure this is true - for ANY UNIT OF ACCOUNT.  
@_date: 2016-07-25 16:26:44
So it's real because you painted it, just like if I write "dollar" on a piece of tissue with crayon, this is real because I did it?  That doesn't sound very convincing.  When somebody writes "dollar" on an account, they are implying that the unit has the substance of a silver coin, that is it has the substance of something limited and scarce and therefore valuable.  The implication is false because there is no limit to the amount of units I can create like that.  Thus I would be imitating fraudulently or counterfeiting.  Most so-called US Dollars are created as so in imitation of money with intent to deceive or defraud, hence the term counterfeit.

I was referring more to the problem with the fiat cost estimate, but that's an interesting question as well.  I think the price-to-secure is on average or at least tends toward the security-provided.  This is kind of like saying you get what you pay for.  So once there are no subsidy rewards, the security will be equal to the amount of direct TX fees.

True, but a double-spend attack is not exactly stealing.  On a poorly secured coin I can't steal coin directly from you, I can only fool you into thinking you were paid then changing the ledger..  bouncing checks if you will.  That checks can be bounced doesn't necessarily mean the ride's over.  The accepting-check-from-untrusted-parties ride is over though, and that's a problem no question about it.

Sorry to be the bearer of bad news, but they are all counterfeit.  More specifically, there is no verifiable definition of real apart from being able to pawn it off on some bank employee.  You might not care how easy it is for issuers to create more units, but a lot of people do care.

Paper futures like ETFs may be inflated, but not the underlying asset.  The teleport is instant, it's waiting for N public confirmations of the teleport that takes N\*10 minutes.

Try "googling" you mean.  (I don't use google) 
Most every dictionary I found includes the phrases "fraudulently passed off" and "unreal", which justifies use of the term.    
@_date: 2018-12-15 09:49:59
All agreed, except minor quibbles.  
I agree with your assessment re: inflating futures, the only possible difference is that for public coin physical delivery is instant and nearly free.  That might help to keep fractional reserve schemes from getting too dominant.
  
When you use a debit card, you will wait forever for a public confirmation as there aren't any public confirmations.  I've never seen anyone in a retail situation wait for confirmations for public coin transactions, they are all effectively instant - ditto privately issued digital currencies like wechat bucks and alipay bucks.  Waiting for a confirmation in a retail setting would be like a restauranteur waiting 3 months for a credit card transaction make it to their atm-witdrawable account before bringing the food out.  Of course if you are receiving payment anonymously online, you will need to wait for some confirmations.        
As for disputes between parties, that's a long question, thankfully we have been working on it for thousands of years.  No perfect solutions exist but there are social systems like courts, reputation reporting,..  anyway it's nothing new with public coin that wasn't exactly the same with gold or paper money.

Well it's a semantic argument I suppose but I believe all the futures contracts stay in the hands of Bitmex, seeing as there's no way for them to be transferred out of the site as users can only withdraw bitcoin.  As I understand it an exchange has taken place if I come in with asset A and leave with asset B.  If I can't leave with anything other than asset A then it's hardly honest to call this an exchange.

"First, it is undeniable that exponentially increasing hash power is terrible for the environment."  Actually it is totally deniable.  That some people are losing money and burning power in a mining craze might be unfortunate but the long term effect here \- treating energy in a sane manner as worth money rather than something we don't give a shit about and give freely to money printers to do whatever they might like \- is net positive for the energy budget of the planet and the environment.

Interesting comparison of Calvinism to Confucianism :)  While it may be that in some ways "going against the government" is seen as more socially acceptable in the West, it is stomped on much harder by governments like the United States which incarcerates and prosecutes far more of its citizens.  What these stories don't capture is the truth on the ground which is a vastly decreased police presence in mainland china compared to the united states.

You gotta understand a geometric series.  The reward is cut in half every four years.  Sure it doesn't reach 0.00000000 for 100 years but effectively in 2030ish or sooner the reward is negligible.    
@_date: 2019-03-03 11:27:56
Again interesting.  The urbanization explanation doesn't do too well.  In the Chinese cities you will immediately notice much lower police presence than US cities as you don't hear sirens, nobody is pulled over, no stop-and-frisk, no curfews / liquor laws / far less zoning and business regulation.  Also, rural areas of the states can sometimes be worse than the cities as the regulators have less to do and come down harder on any perceived social infraction.   
 Your explanation of the incarceration as "for the cheap labor" is pretty brutal but perhaps in part correct, but I think there is more going on in terms of the mindstate required to feel that having the power to break up families and ruin lives is somehow a good thing to have and use.  I guess the concerning thing about mass surveillance and control is the abuse of power which so often has taken place when it has been enabled.  Do you think this Calvinist vs Confucian viewpoint can explain why there is more "abuse of power" (forgive the poor terminology) in the US?

At the historic rate of inflation, it would take over a hundred years for the price of a loaf of bread to go over one million dollars.  However it appears that the last decade or so has dwarfed previous issuance rates, pushing that inevitability quite a bit forward.  The interesting question is not whether a bitcoin will be worth a million dollars, which has a definitive yes.  The interesting question is when.  2030 or 2130, which do you think is closer?

Thanks for your reply.  Yes I guess like the Milgram experiment, people abuse their power often when they are permitted (and wherever, and even for no personal gain), and sadly nobody seems to pay attention to this important lesson in psychology and we enable it again and again.   It is also easy to notice in Europe, where again the American tourist stands out when you see their fear of police which is not as common amongst the locals there (even the Germans!).  We have done an extremely poor job of not enabling abuses of power in the States, perhaps the worst in the world, with our setting up of unaccountable agencies, civil asset forfeiture, mass surveillance, and the prison industrial complex as you describe.  This "push back" you speak of is less common in the states than anywhere else I've seen.  Instead we watch the abuses of power on tv and laugh at the victims, and say they had it coming.  I'm not sure it's entirely valid to say the state is corrupt to its core, but it is an unstable equilibrium which easily collapses to such corruption.  I hear where you are coming from there.

Well, we could argue about just what constituted "hyper"inflation but certainly million dollar bitcoin seems to fit that bill.  The sooner the better.

Sorry to hear your troubles.  Some thoughts:  
1)  "Virus scanners"  are generally malevolent.  Not recommended, they might even be run by people trying to steal your bitcoins.  Unless they are open source don't use them.  
2)  You say "encrypted" but what does this mean really?  Did you have an encryption key and run the open source encryption software yourself?  
3)  What generated the private keys?  Did you add your own entropy or just let some software pick "random" numbers for you?  
4)  Obviously no seriously large amount of money (as determined by the user) should be left on a device with a proprietary OS like windows or mac, unless first encrypted on a different device.
Good luck

Geometric series converge very quickly.  We are already well above 3/4 of total supply distributed.  This problem will hit much earlier; 2030s block reward drops below 1 BTC.   What happens is "the network is supported by fees"  which means that fees must be large to incentivise a large security against double spend.  This means many transactions might flee to other coins with a longer term and slower release schedule such as logarithmic.

This has always been why I personally never recommend hardware wallets.  Where did the entropy come from to generate the seed?  Even if the device does a very good PRNG, this is still just a PRNG and still could have in theory been tampered with.  This is probably an over-paranoid concern, as nobody has demonstrated problems with it, but - it remains a concern - and it is not a concern if we generate our own privkey and write it down on paper.

OMG this is hilarious thanks.  Letting criminals issue currency and take anything they want from the people using that currency is \-\-  get this \-\-  "allowing citizens a means to build wealth"!!  
I don't know, it's harder to get more unequal than "I can have as many units as I want at any time, without telling you about it, and you can't".   To be fair nothing changes in a public coin other than that nobody can issue the coin in private.  So otherwise inequality can be just as high here, apart from the issuance inequality aka interest rate apartheid.

Either that or you are telling us that for custodial storage you can't do much better than casino chips, which might in fact be a valid argument.  It is unlikely that both these positions will be wiped out simultaneously, but it's possible.

Pocket change.  Nowhere near a significant amount of the trillions of fiat dollars issued from nothing in 2019.

Actually "Rat poison" is a very apt name for public coin.  Those "rats" who dilute supply, counterfeit, and perform monetary supply fraud - on a variety of assets - will eventually be poisoned by the transparency of the public and open system now available to the whole world.

It's perhaps worth noting that under this reasonable criteria, all Microsoft, Apple, and Adobe software is also malicious.  Well it certainly is, and also shouldn't be run on machines holding sensative information.

Your reasoning.  It is broken.  If the hashing algorithm were changed to, say, anything else, it would still be possible to make backdoored hardware!  The existence of specialized hardware means only that there is a market for said hardware.  Should we also stop using latin characters for English because some guys wrote phishing spam using these latin characters?

“Research by my staff indicates that privately issued currencies can lead to unstable money supply and depreciation of the currency,”  &lt;--  LOL?  Very true but completely at odds with his conclusions.  A Freudian slip or what?  The dollar is issued privately.  Bitcoin is issued publicly.  Every issuance event is public for all to see.  The  dollar is issued in private, behind closed doors.

Ugh not selfish mining again.  The notion that a miner with less than 50% of the hash rate not publishing blocks would be construed as an attack is broken.  Not only does the theory not work, as such actions clearly constitute a loss of revenue, but also in practice - nothing of the kind has been observed as a vulnerability on the network.  Can we move on please?

Use 2 party escrow.  E.g. 2crow.org.  What is this, the dark ages?  
Edit: 2 party escrow is a 2 of 2 multisignature address, so that both parties control the funds until the deal is concluded.

None of the numbers represent the past purchase prices of course.  They mean the current exchange value of the asset, in other words even if you bought an apple share for 1 cent,, if you hold it today, you might say that you have $156 convertible value invested in apple.  You might even say that you "have $156 dollars invested in apple",, butt yeah - assigning a number of counterfeitable funbux to represent value might not be a good idea for other reasons.

You're confused.  There are no "the developers" for bitcoin.  If you are talking about a specific node, wallet, business, website, etc., yes there are developers.  Be specific as to your allegations, they will be more effective that way.

I agree it is interesting.  Satoshi also agreed which is probably why he created the most regulated currency ever used - in which every money creation event is public and verifiable by anyone.  Continuous public audit.  Maximally regular.

Oh I see.  If the small company needs the money to purchase raw material to build your equipment, you are not looking for an escrow.  This is called "fronting".  You need to trust this company, otherwise the transaction will not happen.  Perhaps even send personnel there to oversee.  If you are looking for escrow, that is, a way to hold the money so that your business partners can't be tempted to run away with it, then use 2 of 2 escrow.  It works with any amount.  :D  good luck

How do you figure?  It took three years to reach the price of the 2013 high.  Now we're barely one year away from the 2017 high.
