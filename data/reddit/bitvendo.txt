They don't want anything to do with Bitcoin, exact words -
"Not in a million years"

They said when the ponzi scheme goes bust the airport would be to blame for providing the service. They want nothing to do with it and think it will never catch on.
We all know they're wrong, and when they do accept Bitcoin they'll try and make themselves look like innovators. As an Irish man I sadly see this backward attitude too often.

Expect to hear "What's Bitcoin?" over and over. I'm sure it will be easier in the US, you guys are alot more advanced than here.

Yes we already have funding for FIAT machines, expect to see one early this Summer. Won't be quoting the government on the internet though, just incase it ruffles the wrong feathers.

BitVendo Official Comment:
The person above sold us bitcoin and charged us 3% commission. There was no favor involved.
He then left the country failing to collect payment and when he came home to collect demanded the new market rate.
This is not the way to do business. We have offered several times to pay him the correct amount of 501.64euro but he has refused.
This will be a libelous court case now as this unfairly affects our public image and ability to do future business.
I would love to see the 100's of customers who have used our ATM and brokerage service vouch for our rock solid customer care and professionalism.
Conor please send us your details so we can move this forward to a small claims court.
