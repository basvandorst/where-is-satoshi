But then the exchange will know who I am, and be able to piece together my identity from the inputs. I also have to trust the exchange...

Still valid if you aren't mentally ill.

Not really a paradox, same principle as speed of light.

Can you link some of those, and how do I know I can trust them?

The government has a proven track record of false flags to start wars, experiments on its citizens, etc.

Still not bad.

Libra and Bitcoin don't really compete. Not more than gold vs fiat.
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:41:59
Why? They inflate and deflate supply to keep the price at $1.
If demand constantly changes and price is fixed, the only options for a stablecoin is to manipulate supply.
Why are you against it?
@_date: 2019-07-16 22:33:23
You should start buying mBTC.
Edit: it's on sale, only $9.38 / mBTC!

Why wouldn't it be? Look around, open your eyes. Taxation is a literal protection racket.

"Everyone" is very shortsighted, I guess..
Banks could do this with any stablecoin.
@_date: 2019-07-13 03:21:49
Not exactly. It's to keep your own money without involving any third parties.
What's a "bank"?

So far I never heard about issues changing USDT to USD. If that were the case, Tether would be dead.

The whole discussion is about how the first amendment prevents the government from banning Bitcoin, bud. There needs do be some absolutely incredible mental gymnastics accepted by at least 5 judges in Supreme Court for that to happen.

Broadcasting a cryptographically signed message is very much unlike yelling "fire" or, I'll predict your next example, hate speech.
@_date: 2019-08-27 09:45:06
How do I reach you if this happens in the future? I've been wondering for a few weeks now, decided to make this post in hopes you'll see it.
Private message?
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:12:33


Larger transfer of value is possible, exponentially multiplying applications of bitcoin. Meanwhile L2 takes care of coffee buying cases.

And you think it's allowable under first amendment to ban books?

I'd be very very careful shorting Bitcoin while in bull mode.
Shoot, I'd be very very careful trading on margin at all.
@_date: 2019-08-19 02:29:04
Does that apply to "transactions" or just sales?
@_date: 2019-08-06 00:14:13
All you're doing when sending Bitcoin is broadcasting a message.
Literally speech.

No, that's planned for from the very beginning. Absolutely not speculation.
From the whitepaper itself:

If it gets a quarter of gold's market cap, the barrier to entry is still low.
Only $9.80 / mBTC, it's peanuts right now.
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:27:32
If make this chart for Bitcoin vs gold, the ratio stays approximately the same.
This isn't just fiat inflation, no sir.

When they become a larger part of the pie that miners are getting. Which is after this halving, and even more so after the next. 6.25 -&gt; 3.125 -&gt; 1.5625

Quantum computers are just next gen asic miners.
All that achieves is increasing mining difficulty.
The worst case scenario is that people will be forced to only use addresses once, because once you send from an address, the full public key is exposed (as opposed to part of it).

It does in theory protect even kiddie porn novel authors.
And it obviously protects passing messages about shuffling bits from box to box.

That's a bit stupid.
Establish a sell schedule and follow it rigidly. Sell 5% on every doubling, for example.

That's not very smart, what if someone sends something there by accident? Always save your private keys.

Or just use a hardware wallet.

When are we getting Schnorr on Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-06-25 15:09:06
Wtf is a "stablecoin like Gemini"? That's an exchange. You may have meant Tether, a centralized stablecoin.
Libra is a semi-distributed stablecoin, among corporations anyway, and is backed by a basket of several fiat currencies, softening the impacts of crashes for any single fiat currency and being a good candidate for third world citizens with unstable local fiat. It is unlikely to simply lose value once established.

The blockchain is forever. Look it up.

If you've been around long enough, Bitcoin has a habit of becoming the  asset of your total net worth.
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:29:57
Third world poor are more likely to get the super-fiat stablecoin, since their local fiat is shit.
Third world wealthy, however, may get sucked into Bitcoin, especially as fiat stablecoin legitimizes crypto for the general public.

Why are you taking them out of the equation?
They specifically are a very large part of the equation.

Anywhere from 32k to 150k.
Consider this - the price is $12.37/mBTC.
Now go back to 2013 and look at that chart.

A lack of *need* to work would allow me to actually explore what I really want and give me the funding to try actually doing it.
Right now, work is just a way to make money to pay for survival and hopefully early retirement, if I make it. Probably just survival. I do not particularly enjoy my job, but it pays alright, so I put up with it.

I am not even asking about accepting Bitcoin, but specifically lightning network Bitcoin, even if it's through a payment processor. (Are there any payment processors on Lightning?)
Bitcoin L1 is simply not scalable for the amount of transactions after the next ATH FOMO.
We are approaching the point where L2 becomes necessary.
Thanks for link.

If you want to know the truth just go looking for it.
Fear uncertainty doubt about some idiotic YouTube video maker? Yeah, ok.
I am only afraid he will hurt btc by misrepresenting it like he does with other topics.

Too much time in the sun on his boat.

It doesn't require a GUI.
You can connect Schildbauch's Bitcoin Wallet to it, for example. Or any other wallet that allows you to specify a node to connect to.
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:41:06
But did you cut off your penis or do you still sport it? Just curious.

Don't trust his videos.

The underlying token may be the same, but someone accepting L1 is not accepting L2 by default.
I am asking about L2.
