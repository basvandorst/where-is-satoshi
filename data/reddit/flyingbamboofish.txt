Could you go in more detail? If the transaction doesn't confirm will my btc just disappear into limbo. And what do you mean by resend them?

I checked the transaction when i got home 5 hours ago and it was still there. And i'm pretty sure i sent it to the correct address
I have never heard of transactions just disappearing? I dont know if its relevant, but i have enabled Auto-Helix to another wallet (electrum).
Address to the other wallet: 1PTgVu7R95uh5oPsX1UzHPi2gze5GSiFaG

So let me see if it get it. Right now my transaction is unconfirmed becuase of a low fee. If i am unlucky it won't be picked up by miners and after some time the btc will transfer back into the wallet they were sent from?
edit: I just searched for the tx i got from tradeblock.com on blockchain.info and it gave me this error message: "Transaction rejected by our node. Reason: Transaction was previously accepted but has been pruned from our database." What does this mean?

Ah alright. So they are still in the wallet, just "hidden" because i said they should go to another wallet? And if the transaction remains unconfirmed it will be "un-hidden" because it is no longer going to the other wallet?
Do you by any chance know if this will ever confirm? And if not, when wil the btc be available in my wallet again? 
I'm starting to get a little irritated because its been over 2 days now.

Alright, i just think i'll wait it out. Thank you very much for your help! The btc were sent from a website that specializes in onions, so i don't think there is an option like that.
