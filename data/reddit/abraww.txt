We usd HD deterministic key as master key and derive other keys from that.  It is our desire to build a tool to allow our users to extract their key for different native wallets (BTC, LTC, BCH, ETH) that we support.  Unfortunately, that work has not made it unto our product roadmap yet.  In the case of synthetic assets like ETF, Stocks, those assets are locked in a multi-sig bitcoin contract.  Therefore, unless a user has both keys (user's key AND Abra's key), you can't spend it.

This is of course possible but not probable.  If a catastrophic event like this happens, we will most likely do the following:
1. Create a separate app on iOS and Android to extract user's private key.  Hopefully Apple and Google will allow this simple app.
2. Abra will create a separate open source tool to allow users to liquidate their assets into BTC or other crypto with the extracted user private key.
What I described may not be what exactly happens but it gives you an idea on how Abra will insure users do not lose their funds.

We are currently NOT using LTC for our smart contracts due to lack of LTC liquidity and borrowing capabilities.  We may still consider using LTC in the future.
In terms of LN, we love the technology and we think it is great.  The question for Abra regards LN comes down to what problems are we trying to solve with LN.  Questions that are relevant to LN are:
1. Does it help Abra reduce BTC mining fees / transaction costs?
2. Does it help Abra's user experience, for example, instantaneous confirmations?
3. Does it make it easier for users to add money (LN instead of BTC) for stocks and ETF trading?
In regards to  and  we already have solutions that are easier to implement than LN.  For  we need to take a wait and see until LN matures a bit more.  Currently, there are 3 ways to use LN, first, you can run your own LN node (we don't think this will work for our users).  Second, you can have someone else host LN nodes (LN as a service).  Third, you can use a swap provider to swap between LN and other crypto, like BTC.  In the second and third scenario, in order to get LN via BTC for example, you will still need to pay the initial BTC cost, then you will get LN.  That is similar to exchanging native BTC on Abra for Abra synthetic USD.  There is the BTC cost.  In summary, if everyone has LN, then it makes perfect sense for Abra to have a LN wallet leveraging LN as a service) so that it can be a liquidity option for trading stocks and etfs.

We are definitely aware of the various limitations (withdraw fees depending on btc price fluctuations for example) of our synthetic asset platform.  These are actually solvable problems given time.  Our goal is to make synthetic assets act and behave exactly like native assets.  For example, Apple stock will pay dividends and give price exposure to Apple.  XRP can deposit and withdraw with low fees similar to native XRP.  We will be working hard to make this happen.  We are all in on the synthetic platform because it can quickly offer all types of assets for decentralized investing.  Therefore, we will overcome these limitations as quickly as we can.

We have on the roadmap to show the transaction hash of our transactions in the transaction history.  Internally, we have access to it, but we want to expose it to the user in the future.  It will be implemented but not sure when.

Currently, we already support deposit via our partner Coinify.  We support SEPA (Single Euro Payment Area) for all major banks via Coinify.  Essentially, user go through KYC via Coinify, then initiate bank transfer to Coinify to buy bitcoin, then bitcoin arrives at Abra wallet.  For direct banking integration, we have several partnership discussions happening right now, but it will probably take 6-9 months due to various regulatory, licensing issues in the Euro zones before we have it in place.

We are definitely exploring more options.  Currently, we have Unionbank.  We are working to expand that.  We will also have international wire via SWIFT soon.  If there is one cash-in option that is a must have in PH, what would it be?  7-Eleven?  Another Bank?  Thank you.

As you know, we have added native ETH as part of wallet, so we can add ERC20 support.  We want to add as many liquidity options, including stablecoins, so that people all over the world can invest in stocks and ETFs.  However, we don't have an exact timeline outside of TUSD for now.

If you are using crypto, we ask for your phone number and name as part of signup process of Abra.  We hope to offer international wire soon via SWIFT.  That will require KYC process including proof of address, passport, and other documents depending on country and amount to be transfered.
Currently, there are no plans for Abra web version but we will consider it in the future.

If Abra is ever at risk of a bankruptcy, we will make sure you can liquidate your assets and withdraw your money via BTC or other crypto.  Abra has successfully hedged our collateral contracts with 0 loss to our customers for many years.

Very soon.  We have access to 7000+ assets (Stocks + ETFs).  We can also integrate with non-US equity price feeds.
