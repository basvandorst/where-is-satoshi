Rich people being having no respect for money and rubbing it in our face while people starve to death in developing nations and single mothers struggle to feed their kids. OP is probably Martin Shkreli.

The "mainstream media" doesn't *ever* mention renewable energy because "they" don't want you to know about it.
[Google News Search for the term "renewable energy"](

Oh no this is fine, not bullying at all. I totally bitch-smacked some guy in another sub recently because he *was* bullying someone: "What part of [forum guideline xyz] don't you understand?"
But I'm glad Cowboy_Coder informed me about the sidebar rules in a courteous manner. I'd like to see more of that on reddit.

Is that what he said in the interview?
Edit: Sorry, that sounds really passive aggressive. That's not what he says in the interview. He refers to renewable energy as something you'll "never" hear about from the mainstream media. The guy immediately picks up on Brand's ridiculous hyperbole and comments how there's much more information out about it now than there used to be, which is true. 
This guy is on promoting his single-perspective opinion work as some kind of unbiased "truth" news organization, it's just silly. Even Fox news talks about developments in renewable energy production. Why try to pretend like the fact that solar panels exist is some top-secret knowledge that the media and government are trying to keep secret from everyone? Discussions about renewable energy is EVERYWHERE in every major magazine and news network. 
Whether it's sufficient or the perspective of those media outlets are in line with Brand's or yours or mine is irrelevant. I'm just not into this wacky "you're all sheep" illuminati garbage.

Wait, are we talking about Bitcoins or women?
