as a trader I learned that there are 2 primary emotions behind stock market, and maybe its amplified with crypto: Fear and greed.  
greed that BTC will go 600k in a year, or fear that it will burst. and that explains the wild swings, compared to a company like aapl or msft or ATVI, which have fundamentals such as income, profit, sales, etc, that keep it grounded.    
.  
second thing I learned was NEVER EVER get personally vesting in anything. Thats synonymous with hype.  
I had a friend, who was a techie,  tell me that the microsoft surface was gonna be the next big thing, and he listed off all its technical specs, told me it was gonna replace the ipad, and to dump all my aapl stock for MSFT stock, and of couse history has dictated that he was wrong when it comes to market and stocks. Was it better technically, maybe. was it better from a global consumer standpoint, no.  
but the thing was that he was so sure of himself, no doubt in his mind that it was gonna be successful and that MSFT stock would skyrocket
