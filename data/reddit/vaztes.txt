Lol nobody knew. You can make an educated guess and decide to go "all or nothing" and it paid off, but nobody who bought at under a dollar knew.

Fuck it dude. Nobody could have predicted this. It's of literally NO use to feel bad over something that never happened.

Can't even sell when kraken is down.

The conversaion rate is about 6.3 dkk to 1 usd, so having a billion dkk isn't that shabby.

It has nothing to do with the meme. The fun in dogecoin is the fun in cryptocurrency and community. People who have never heard about cryptocurrencies are getting introduced via dogecoin. Exploring and learning something new is always exciting. That's where the fun lies. Because it's easily accessible. It's in the crypto, not the meme.

There was never a cap. They simply chose to do nothing.

This is just the beginning. News not even been out for an hour. We're gonna see the 800's no question.

I had no idea that thread blew up as much as it did. I made a few neutral comments yesterday at about 20 upvotes, but 2700? Jesus, I understand why some of you guys are upset. That's rediculous.

Can't really get a proper perspective by hourly trading. Dogecoin is worth less today than it was 24 hours ago.
Not to say that it has any revelance. As I said, day to day charts are not very representative of a coin.

God damn. You got some nice return there. I was looking at ANT at around the same price, 6 dollars or so.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:24:51
Wait what, really? So if you bought ANT a month ago, they'd be NEO now? What happened?

Called a full house, right?

Every trade I have made since jan 2017 pales in comparison to what I would've had just holding bitcoin. Listen to this man.

You haven't been mining bitcoin right? You're losing more than you gain, even if electricity is free (hardware costs).
If you want to mine crypto there are other coins that are 10x more profitable than btc as a casual miner.

M8 I bought in at 850 this year and sold at 1700.
I did sell for ETH and managed to ride that up, but bottom line if I had just kept BTC I would've been up much more.

Depending on your card it can change. A point to factor is also potential future worth.
Three quick coins that are potentially worth it are Monero, Zcash and Vertcoin.
