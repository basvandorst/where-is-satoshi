I put the Wallet.dat into the bitcoin file in my program files(x86) will that work?

Hey thanks for trying to help. the thing is I got the Wallet.dat file when I click the file tap in the bitcoin wallet, and then clicked the backup wallet icon. so I have no idea where to put the Dat.file in the new wallet.
