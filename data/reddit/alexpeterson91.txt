Imagine I ran an educational website designed for children.  They micropay (on the order of cents or less) from an account/wallet setup by their parents to view educational videos.  If at the end of the day a parent were able to review their children's purchases and decide to reverse their transactions, then my website would be defrauded on a regular basis, kids pay to watch, get irreversible information, then reverse the financial transaction.

Amazon and their Marketplace vendors are very careful about where they send certain items.  For example pepper spray is sold on Amazon, and while it is perfectly legal to purchase and carry pepper spray in most places, it's illegal to own pepper spray in Massachusetts without a special license.  Amazon vendors check for these things and make sure they don't ship pepper spray to Massachusetts.  Circle has come out and said that they will just not allow anyone to purchase weapons of any kind regardless of the legality for you the end user, this protects them from any kind of enforcement action by a locality that does prohibit such items.

@_date: 2015-06-04 19:04:41
In the U.S. The regulations state that any transaction over $10,000 requires the filing of a CTR by the recipient of the funds. The recipient must not only have identification up to and including SSN for the sender/transferer but also know the source of the funds.  The so called "travel rule" applies to all transactions $3,000 or more, the recipient is required to have identification for the sender/transferer including name DOB and street address. Though there is no statute or regulation in federal law that requires information starting at $1, there are some states that require this information. Further there are many reasons money transmitters require information from $1. For example, all compliance programs must have special policies in place to prevent pooling or structuring transactions for example one user using 5 burner phone numbers to purchase or sell say $5,000 at a time. If the  company doesn't have ID for each user's $1000 transaction then they cannot find people who try to circumvent their policies or the federal $3,000 travel rule nor can they report suspicious activity, another requirement of the Bank Secrecy Act. Regardless of whether or not the company was aware of the pooling occurring they can and will be held liable by FinCEN during an audit or investigation for not having a robust AML policy and face a sizable fine and/or be shutdown. I also know that right now FinCEN is performing such audits on BTM providers.

While I disagree that you should discount any attempt at identification for Bitcoin purchasing because due to the state of Anti-money laundering laws worldwide it's nearly impossible to avoid through nearly all legal channels, I can help you with determining that Robocoin is something you should RUN away from. Robocoin now DBA Romit, has a horrible track record within the BTM space and has recorded all your information to steal for its own datamining purposes while securing it in a joke of a db. They broke many federal laws by intentionally destroying certain required data and then pulling additional information from their users such as email addresses. Their security and customer service is horrendous and their business lost nearly 100% of their operators (partners who locally owned and ran machines) over 6 months ago when they forced a software update that everyone rejected, when they centralized all wallets forcing all users to use the Robocoin web wallet and disallowing direct withdrawals and paper wallets.

Some of my trades were in the Japan files, and some in the Coinlab files, but some in between are nowhere to be found. My trades have the timestamp on them direct from the MtGox auto-send email server, but cross checking the times and my user_ID several trades are nowhere to be found.

I disagree these new proposals would truly cut Canada off from the rest if the world.  Several us based exchanges deal almost exclusively in Europe because they can do so without extensive registration and licensure requirements. Coinsetter and kraken are prime examples.  If they were Canadian they would be unable to operate under the new Canadian rules as BOTH parties on both sides of the border need to register with FinTRAC, which is unreasonable and wildly inefficient.

Do I agree that that information should be taken? No, not really it does seem pretty perposterous to me, but it doesn't matter, it's simply a consequence of following the Bank Secrecy Act, the consequence of not doing so is an ankle monitor, (see Charlie Shrem)  Robocoin and all these operators are doing what they need to in order to comply with KYC (Know Your Customer) laws.  All MSBs need to practice KYC, meaning they need to know who their customers are, and where they live.  If a particular customer wants to be somewhat regular user or high volume, further verification is needed to ensure that the money is not being used for illegal purposes, nor is it coming from illegal activities.

Here is the problem about those limits.  How can such limits be enforced by an automated machine if it does not collect such information?   If it only limited transactions to $1000. It would be trivial to sit there and just do transaction after transaction pretending to be different people.  This is why ID must be taken below such limits.   
As for the money transmitter business, the IRS's recent declaration regarding bitcoin as property only is relevant for determining taxes.  FinCEN is the regulatory body who governs financial transactions and they very clearly and explicitly stated in guidance issues last march that exchanging bitcoin which is classified as a convertible decentralized currency is money transmission.   Government agencies disagree on things all the time it's unfortunate but true.

I'm not commenting on the validity of the leak, rather that there may be something else going on here.  The leak is clearly valid, as I could find most of my 2013 trades, however on all their records some of my trades are absent, even though that time frame is still accounted for in the records.  This leads me to believe there may have been deeper technical issues that caused certain trade data from the April 2013 bubble period (I need to recheck to find exactly which dates are missing) to be corrupted/deleted.   I say this because assuming this is a leak of raw trade data as it appears to be, there should be no actual trades that are unaccounted for in Mt.Gox's DB.  
* The DB leak contains most of the 2013 trade data, which can be cross-referenced and verified against other sources. However, cross-referencing with other sources also proves that the leaked DB was missing some trades.
* There were no missing timespans on the leaked DB, therefore the leak was not incomplete but rather the raw data from the DB appears to be incomplete, which suggests there were severe technical problems or internal manipulation.
* Finally be sure to temper any conclusions drawn from analyzing the leaked DB, as it has been confirmed to be incomplete.

Absolutely fees will fall. Significantly.  Right now operators are subject to fees between 2-5% to move their money into exchanges from the machines. When banks and other services become more open to bitcoin, operator costs will fall which will lead to increased competition and therefore lower end user fees. It's not that ATMs charge you the high fees because of bitcoin, it's because that's how they have to deal with the expensive fiat side. 
@_date: 2014-05-17 00:22:47
There is no single bitcoin exchange rate, instead they are decentralized to dozens of exchanges across the globe. Different exchanges have different rates. Robocoin kiosks are not exchanges rather over the counter vendors who set their own prices generally a % above a popular exchange's rate for example 5% above Bitstamp. There is no issue here simply a convenience fee built into the price they charged. It is your responsibility to investigate what prices are at different places and then decide where you will purchase it from.

And there's the problem, in the US the Bank secrecy act requires MSBs to know their customers this means they need to know who you are and where you live.  After a certain threshold you need to know where the money is going and where it's coming from.  if someone is transacting 40k$ in a week then a SSN is required along with employment since that's nearly a years wage for many people. The bank secrecy act is why anyone has ever gotten "the call" from their bank it's a requirement of all forms of money transmission.  The bank secrecy act really puts the duties of the government to monitor financial transactions for potential money laundering back on the banks and MSBs   Which is why operating an MSB is so difficult in the US

This is a slightly different experience I've had In which Coinbase support identified the name belonging to the owner of a Bitcoin address I had sent a small amount of coins to. It was not really an issue for me, as I knew the owner, and the fact that he had a Coinbase account, but I sent coins to his address not his email, and support identified the owner for me, which I think can be considered a privacy leak.

Let me try to clarify a few concerns you may have regarding the information collected by Robocoin kiosks. 
Why Phone Number? 
	Communication - the process of waiting for approval, and network confirmations during SELLs requires a short waiting period 5-10 minutes.  By having you phone # we can always alert you as soon as your account/transaction is ready.
	As our customer we need to some sort of contact information for you, and we don’t want to send snail mail to your home. 
Why ID scan?
	KYC - under the BSA all money transmitters must know their customers, specifically their name and address, this helps us to combat money laundering, and is also required by law.  
Why picture?
	We need to know it really is you at the machine, the only way to confirm that the ID you used is actually you is by quickly checking ID picture against your kiosk picture. 
Why Palm scan?
	Once your account is created you no longer need to present your ID or take a photo for transactions.  the completion of the account creation process involves locking your account to biometric information from your palm.  Accessing your account for future transactions is as easy as typing in your phone number and placing your hand over the scanner for a split second.  This way we can confirm it is you using your account again, without needing to reidentify for every transaction.  
I can only assure you for my own operations (My company, Vis Nova Ventures, is launching Robocoins in Boston and Chicago in the coming weeks) but we will NEVER sell nor unlawfully share your personal information with any third parties. Furthermore all personal information is stored on a private secure server hidden behind a multi-factor secured encrypted VPN.
Edit: please share your concerns here I will so my best to alleviate them. I also have no affiliation with this particular operator so please leave the hostility at the door (the government dishes out enough as it is)

To begin, I am talking about the US. So SEPA is not a possibility.  You run a business, but I doubt you run an MSB, which is VERY different from any other type of business when it comes to banking, in fact many banks refuse to bank MSBs at all, because of the incredible compliance costs and liabilities associated with them under US law.  MSBs are considered toxic for banks, this is before even making it a Bitcoin related MSB.  Banks reluctance is based on the fact that they open themselves up to tremendous amounts of liability, but they don't get any additional revenue from banking MSBs.  To address this, banks add additional fees and costs for such MSBs.  I cannot go into detail on fee structures relating to MSBs because they are not set in stone, rather negotiated by the bank and MSB based on the risks involved.  
Bitstamp's bank takes 0.1% of every incoming wire, outgoing wires vary depending on the bank but likely close to 1% total in wire fees.  Lots of US based Bitcoin companies simply cannot get a bank account at all, and are forced to use much less primitive methods of sending money, i.e. money orders, which can cost 2-3%.
Other non-bank associated costs, are surety bonds, most states require that MSBs hold $250k-$1mm in surety bonds, which can cost up to 7% annually.  Cash management is not cheap, armored services providers charge a couple hundred per pickup, which would need to be weekly.  If you vault any cash with the armored provider then you can pay double that.  Insurance costs associated with holding cash in a machine in a public place can run between 5-15% monthly.
Most of the fees however, come from either the bank relationship or the ways in which an operator can continue to operate without a bank.  Once banks become more comfortable with Bitcoin related MSBs then fees will fall, relationships will be easier to come by, and a lot more competition will enter the space, allowing prices to fall for the end user.

This is not how SARs work.  FinCEN has very strict requirements for SARs. Failure to properly file SARs is grounds for revocation of registration, licensure, and may be criminally prosecuted.   Also, it's quite obvious there is a camera, you noticed it yourself, wouldn't you simply hide from it or cover it if you were attempting to circumvent its policies?


Correct, however we will not be actively manually reviewing transactions as they occur in realtime on a minute to minute basis, therefore anyone could just walk up and do 10 back to back transactions, before anyone noticed. 


This would actually be illegal, alerting the person that you have caught doing something "suspicious" is prohibited by FinCEN.


We aren't trying to compete with Coinbase, we are in entirely different markets.  Kiosks offer a different service than Coinbase, that is the extreme convenience cash for coin, an ability to buy Bitcoin nearly instantly without needing a bank account and a VISA card.  
Coinbase also has extensive KYC policies, which include the same verification policies employed by most Robocoin operators.  Coinbase requires you to verify your phone number and a US bank account.  They used to also require a SSN and run a credit history test on you.  A couple months ago they streamlined their process using their bank partner.  Instead of running a full check on you themselves, they just get that information from your bank, through their bank, using an information sharing network permitted under the BSA.  Either way, Coinbase or Robocoin, you will be directly or indirectly sharing this information with the third party.  Coinbase takes a bank account too, Robocoin just asks for a quick smile.  (and if you have used a Robocoin palm scanner, then you have seen exactly what the scanner captures on screen, a very blurry image of your palm veins, nothing you should be scared of sharing, so far the only use is a password for your Robocoin account.)

Forgot tumbling coins, bitcoin best practices calls for you to use a new address for every single tx and never reuse an address. For example. When sending 1 coin from an address with 2. You should be sending 1 to the recipient and the "change" to a new address you create yourself.  Some wallets do this by default.  If you are looking for privacy you should never ever reuse an address.

Robocoin only allows operators to either use their KYC verification service or not.  ID scan, verification, phone number, palm vein scan are all part of that package. The palm scan is an integral part of Robocoin's KYC system and US based operators do not have a choice whether or not to collect KYC info, it is a requirement.  Robocoin operators are not to blame for the inclusion or use of palm vein scans in the kiosks.

I've been keeping encrypted backups of all my Google Auth keys since day one.  I personally would rather hold all the keys myself, than have to deal with yet another company holding my info.  Even though its all encrypted and I'm sure they can't access my info, why even chance it since its just as a easy to lock up everything in a TrueCrypt folder and then even if Authy disappears I still have 100% control over my keys.  Further, as far as multiple device support goes, I have no need to spread access to my accounts across anything other than the phone that's in my pocket 100% of the time.  I would have a lot more to worry about if I had to also keep 100% control of my iPad, backup phone, etc.  and BTW keeping my own backups of the keys allows me to add them to other devices just as easily as I added the first, if I so desired.

They aren't. People have this idea that it should just be cash in coin out out no questions asked.  That's just not how it works in the US.  Look at the other options like coinbase.  You need to give them access to your bank account and your phone number. And wait 5 days for coins.  They still get all your KYC info but instead of taking it themselves they get it from your bank which you already have your SSN and drivers license.   
The palm vein scan is a password. Nothing else. It's impossible to fake and it's stored in a hash format just like any other sort of password. That means that even the operators don't have info that they can ever use against you or steal from you. Further nobody uses palm vein scans for anything except access control and even that is a very limited use.  While the process isn't ideal by any means it's not embarrassing, what is embarrassing is people's willful ignorance of regulations and hostility towards those who try to explain it to them.

There are countless databases of fingerprints around different government agencies etc.  AFAIK there are no similar databases for palm vein scans.  And sorry, I didn't mean to say palm print, it's palm vein, which is impossible to fake (even if someone cuts off your hand), and can only be read using a particular type of reader.  There is no way to forensically lift palm vein prints off of objects like fingerprints, because it is an image of the blood in your veins of your hand.  In this way it does serve as a unique, non-identifying, non forge-able password.
In other words, the palm vein scan could serve literally no purpose outside of your account password.  Unlike databases of fingerprints used to catch criminals based on physical evidence they leave behind, a database of palm veins could only help the investigation if the criminal used a palm vein scanner during the robbery.

These "audits" are incomparable. In order to appease MtGox users who believed MtGox's FIAT withdrawal issues to be the result of insolvency, roger visited Gox. And watched over Mark's shoulder as he logged into his Mizhuo bank accounts where Roger confirmed he saw over $100 million in company accounts which proved that the fiat withdrawal issues were not occurring due to a lack of fiat in the bank.  Roger never checked their bitcoin reserves which turned out to be the problem in the end. 
Here Mike did a cryptographic bitcoin audit proving that Bitstamp holds enough coin to cover customer deposits. This is much more than Gox ever did, as banks don't lose fiat too easily.

He got it from the group of Bitcoin insiders, ie the 6 exchanges that issued the joint statement and reading the info along with the context he assumed that there was not only a massive loss at Gox, but that all the companies involved were complicit in a $400 million coverup that would destroy the whole infrastructure, ie all those exchanges get shut down by international law enforcement

First off Coinbase requires you to give them your bank account and SSN, much more dangerous personal information to give away than a scan of your ID.  One of the other problems with Coinbase is that if you want Bitcoin instantly you need a Visa credit card, and are limited to $100 per week.
I have a long standing personal history with Coinbase, that they themselves have acknowledged in support emails, yet it has taken 2 weeks to create and verify my business account, and obtain $100 worth of Bitcoin to pay one of my technicians.
Our machine allows you to create an account, and buy or sell up to $9,999 worth of Bitcoin within 30 minutes.  There is truly no comparison for actual convenience when you look at it this way.

That's unfortunately not how it works.  Banks refused to work with marijuana dispensaries because it is illegal under federal law.  Instead of changing the federal law, recently the federal government made a statement to the effect of. It's ok to work with legal dispensaries under state law.  Banks said that's not good enough. If you don't change the law we can still be prosecuted therefore the declaration has been pretty useless until the law/statute changes. This is why startups and banks are looking for true guidance. Not just statements that "it's ok".

I entirely disagree, the problem with noob questions isn't so much that they are "stupid" but rather that the same goddamn questions get asked over and over, what happens when the blocks run out?  what's cold storage?  whats a transaction fee? can I just run wallet creation software to find others privkeys?

What you are saying doesn't even make sense. It's been proven that nobody except for Mark knew of the financial situation before very recently. Everyone's concerns were pure speculation. Mark and likely Gonzague are the only ones who had access to the true balance sheet and cold storage and only they would know about the dire situation they were truly in.  This is not how any company with some sort of executive structure operates and cannot be used as an example against private industry. We must demand accountability from major players and Bitcoin gives us the tools for simple transparency. Unlike traditional financial institutions with arbitrary accounting polices that need extensive auditing to verify the authenticity of the statements, and oversight from the government to ensure that it's all done correctly all along incurring excessive costs.  With Bitcoin, all that's needed is a simple signature, a core feature of the protocol. We simply need to demand this of the market, and already many major players have voluntarily taken measures to publicly prove their solvency and financial health.

Sunny king attempted this with primecoin.  It was really an experiment to see if an algorithm that searches for long chains of prime numbers known as Cunningham chains could work effectively as PoW for a cryptocoin. The technology has been proven but it is often debated how useful it is to find long cunningham chains.  Primecoin miners have broken several world records already but finding new longer chains doesn't really do much for anyone. The best argument is that primecoin advances pure mathematics for the sake of mathematics.  
Others have argued that PoW that produces anything truly useful would be useless as PoW because the mining would not be incentivized in the same way as SHA-256 because miners could have more to gain using their PoW for something other than mining.

The operator decides whether or not to activate the KYC service, however in the US collecting KYC info is not an option, rather it's a legal requirement.  Robocoin operators have the option to either use Robocoin's KYC verification program that includes the palm vein scan, or to not use the program at all.  Thus US operators do not actually have an option, they either use Robocoin's program which includes the palm scan, or they face legal repercussions.

My concern here is not that people are spreading and discussing the allegations and rumors etc, rather that people are simply agreeing with them and saying that the foundation just elected a pedophile to the board.  That is slander.  This sort of behavior is detrimental to bitcoins image.
The proper way to address this is not to agree with the allegations as factual but rather understand that they are simply accusations that you should investigate yourself. Not  jump on the tabloid bandwagon.  Clearly the victims and the courts have been appeased, the case would still be ongoing otherwise. 
We claim to be above the medias bullshit and rally behind Dorian when the media screws him publicly, yet a tabloid article from several years ago has sealed Brock's fate.

The reason anonymity is desirable in Bitcoin, is not due to illegal use and the fear of some law enforcement punishing you because they traced your payments.  It's because Bitcoin is 100% transparent through the blockchain, that means that your finances are 100% open to every single person in the world.  Would you be happy with you bank if they published a social media page that shows your current balances to the world, with no privacy settings?  
If I could get find one tx that you were a part of on Blockchain.info.  Then I could trace the money and create a history of everything you've ever bought, traded, sold, gambled, what have you, because you left very obvious traces of your financial history on the blockchain.  While most people don't care that you history may be traceable, just remember that the blockchain is not going away, and all those traces, totally legal, normal use of Bitcoin, may somehow uncover who you are, where you live, and how some malicious person may be able to steal your coins in the future when 1 BTC means a lot more than it does today.  Blockchain analysis and forensics is a budding field, it's quite amazing what anyone can find simply using blockchain.info   They found some Darknet Market hackers over on using that site alone.  Just remember you cannot erase you financial history on the Blockchain.

Star Xu threatened to go public first and when he did he did not only release the information he threatened to he deliberately lied in the press release and also tried to smear Roger's character to back out of a contract he was bound by. 
So far Roger has provided numerous pieces of evidence to his support including dozens of emails and a digital forensic scientist's report concluding with full explanation and details that Star Xu forged a new contract to present to Roger. 
So far, to my knowledge 2 former OKCoin employees have come out to corroborate Roger's story.  
Roger did not go public to protect himself and hurt OKCoin.
OKCoin went public first with no evidence simply to smear Roger. 
If you took any time to read through the trove of evidence you would see that Roger handled himself incredibly professionally even in the face of threats to smear his name.
Xu and OKCoin handled themselves like children with no respect for the rule of law, or business ethics (photoshopping a contract, breach of contract, failure to pay, pretending not to understand English,  pretending to not do business under the name OKCoin claiming it's only a brand, claiming they have no businesses in Singapore, only after removing the clause about Singapore on their homepage, archives prove that and public records in Singapore have three business registrations for OKCoin) the list goes on and on it's truly disrespectful and disgraceful on so many levels.

Those of us that race out in front to get our products to the people, have two options, take a huge risk and ignore their rules and end up like Charlie Shrem with an ankle monitor or do our best to follow the rules until we can shape them to something that is actually beneficial and applicable to Bitcoin.

Mark appears to be trying to draw attention the fact that OKCoin's corporate structure is sketchy.  
The report states that while it is public information that they are highly capitalized from venture investments, on the order of $10mm USD, the company's filings report a surprisingly small amount of shareholders, i.e. 1, and the shareholder and director of the company are changed at least every 6 months.  
This is highly unusual for a corporation that is so highly capitalized, to have singular directors and/or sharholders, there should be a legal entity, such as a trust or LLC or some other vehicle to hold control of the company. 
Each change also begins with a change to the shareholder, which if these reports are properly filed (not likely), it means that each change starts when the shareholder buys out the previous shareholder for his stake, which would require large fund transfers between the shareholders, which is not highly probable.  Also the high turnover rate of at least every 6 months is something suspicious that usually signifies some sort of problem with the company or its governance, regardless it is not a good sign.

Let me back up a little here, MSBs have lots of different requirements imposed on them by federal, state, and sometimes even local governments.  Some of the relevant statues/agencies are listed below:
* Bank Secrecy Act 
* Anti Money Laundering Laws
* OFAC
* USA PATRIOT ACT
OFAC - Office of Foreign Asset Controls maintains lists of unsavory and sanctioned individuals. One in particular is the SDN list or specially designated nationals.  This is one of many lists of international crime figures that all American citizens and residents are prohibited from doing business with.  In order to comply with OFAC names must be collected in order to compare them against this list.
Under the Bank Secrecy Act (33 CFR 10) the basic identification requirements for money transmission begin at $3,000.
Forgetting the hard $3,000 "travel rule" requirement for a moment... the law requires that financial institutions have risk-based programs that are reasonably designed to guard and protect against abuse for money laundering and terrorist financing and that provide for detection, deterrence and reporting of activity hat appears suspicious and designed for the abuse of money laundering and/or terrorist financing.   Different products have different risks.  So for example a wire transfer by a bank for a customer who was verified is different that a wire transfer PUPID transaction which is different than a retail consumer money transfer transaction.  Western Union and MoneyGram require the identification verification at $1,000 and $900 respectively.  General Purpose Reloadable (GPR) prepaid cards typically require validation beyond the initial $500 load.  
Bitcoin is a different risk and no industry standard/best practice determined yet - although some anonymity on purchase up to a couple hundred dollars appears reasonable and justifiable in comparison to other financial products, regulators and law enforcement *prefer that all purchasers were subject to identification and recording*.  In our free society we get to balance out risk, versus inconvenience, etc.  
For better or worse, Bitcoin's ease of use enables structuring and pooling, with very minimal effort.  Furthermore unlike other types money transmission such as MoneyGram or a bank wire, there is no compliant institution on the receiving end of transactions.  This places more responsibility on the Bitcoin MSB than say, a sending MoneyGram agent.   The law calls for a risk-based approach, given just these two points, Bitcoin is much higher risk than MoneyGram or a bank wire, and therefore must have more stringent policies/limits.
MSBs have very strict reporting requirements placed on them by the many different government agencies they operate under.  Reporting requirements must be met for all agencies, but in addition to meeting the requirements imposed by regulatory statues, there are many other factors that come into play.  For example, bank relationships for MSBs are unlike any other type of banking relationship.  A bank that services MSBs has significant reporting requirements over and above the MSB itself; further banks have developed their own requirements in addition to statutory regulations that allow them to manage their risk.  While their policies may not be law, they must be followed in order to maintain the banking relationship.
Banks are not the only other players that may have their own non-statutory requirements, for example, most crypto-currency exchanges require disclosure of AML / KYC policies when opening a corporate account.  In order to develop a partnership with said exchange, they must approve your policies, which is not something they are required to do.
TL;DR  MSBs have many requirements placed on them by several separate government agencies, but in addition to these requirements bank and exchange partners develop their own policies regarding reporting and customer identification often times over and above what is required by statue.  These policies are non-public information unique to the institution.

I certainly was around here for that, and I'm sick of people dragging that little piece of history up.  
Since I was there I remember the facts; for months everyone had concerns about the growing **$USD** withdrawal queue.
 
After months of questions Mark, the person who is actually responsible for the massive coverup at Mt. Gox, asked his old friend Roger (back in the day everyone knew each other, Roger was not Mark's only friend), to come and help verify that the growing withdrawal delays were not in fact due to Mt. Gox having no money in the bank accounts, as was public speculation at the time.
Roger made no comment in his infamous "gun-to-the-head" video about the state of BTC reserves at Mt.Gox, and only stated that they had hundreds of millions of $USD in their bank accounts, as he was shown by Mark when he logged into his bank accounts online as he watched over his shoulder
There was nothing Roger said in that video that was deceitful, and if you spent anytime looking through the gigabytes of leaked Mt.Gox trade data and the reports that were created regarding some of the top accounts at Mt.Gox you will see Roger took a *much* larger hit than any of us did (myself included) when Mt. Gox went down.
Stop living in the past, focus on the present and the issues in front of us today.

Also adds a lot of unnecessary complexity which any engineer knows is bad design. Do we need bigger blocks?  Yes it's obvious if you don't see that it's clear you can't count or understand the central points of Bitcoin as published laid out almost a decade ago.  Do we need bigger blocks now? Yes!!, actually we needed it years ago when this ridiculous discussion began. 
 Do we need tx malleability fixed?  Yes. Do we need it now? No not really the amount of BTC lost ever due to malleability exploits is literally pocket change for any of us who have been in the community for 5 years, it's just for LN, which is only "two weeks" (two years minimum) from being ready for practical and widespread use. 
Does segwit fix the block size?  No. Not at all.
Does BU fix the blocksize?  Yes. Instantly. 
Does segwit fix malleability? Yes, but is this solution a good one since it only adds more complexity and by definition much more bug potential? No not at all. 
Does Segwit do anything else to improve the protocol? 
Does BU fix malleability? No. But does that mean BU supporters like malleability and thinks it's good?  NO!  We need bigger blocks and we need malleability fixed. Neither segwit nor BU alone fixes these issues. Bigger blocks like 8mb have been tested extensively. For years. Gavin ran a 8mb block network for months testing it to death he found no issues.  Segwit hadn't even been proposed by the time Gavin was finished testing 8mb blocks. So who's more prepared and ready from these 2 camps?  The guys running tried and tested code for years which will immediately eliminate an incredibly pressing issue affecting the community, or the guys who can't keep their story straight, flip excuses on a daily basis, forced the most qualified Devs out,  are well known psychopaths (Luke), egotistical and , and sold their souls to Blockstream

He was innocent in many of the charges brought against him.  There is no way any reasonable person can blame him for the deaths of people who bought drugs from street dealers who bought them from SR knowing what they were, and then resold them as something else.  What comes to mind specifically is the guy who bought what he thought was LSD but was really a research chemical, who freaked out after taking it and his friends locked him out on a balcony where he fell to his death.  There is no way that can possibly be Ross's fault, rather it was his friends who locked him in a very dangerous location while he was out of his mind on a drug that some street dealer or possibly another friend of him sold him dangerous chemicals saying it was LSD, which is harmless.  Having the parents testify and blame Ross for their son's death is unbelievable.  Yes his death was a tragedy, but it should be attributed to the people involved in the situation, Ross was not.  It's like if a street dealer says they're selling someone heroin but its really fentanyl and the person OD's and dies.  The pharmaceutical company that actually produced and sold the fentanyl doesn't get blamed for the death, and in Ross's case he wasn't even the supplier or the seller, how they can trace the blame back to Ross is beyond me.
And Preet going around and charging him with all the murder for hire things to paint Ross as a thug was a disgusting legal tactic, say hey this guy tried to have 6 people killed, he's a violent danger to society who should stay in prison for life without the possibility of parole.  The truth is that none of those things actually happened and he wasn't formally charged on those counts, because it was plain and simple entrapment on the part of the feds, and they knew it.  But Preet swayed opinion using that totally messed up information and still got him the max sentence because he pulled that scheme.  
Let's not forget Judge Forrest not allowing a retrial or anything when it was found that there were at least 2 agents from various federal agencies who entrapped him into several other schemes and frauds were convicted of stealing and extorting millions from Ross.  These people also were the ones with full access to the investigation and they could have altered almost all the evidence against Ross (because they didn't allow another inquiry we might never know for sure what they did, but given their actions it's not only possible but probable that they did tamper with the evidence to some degree).  
Yes Ross broke the law, but busting him on RICO charges and trumping up murder for hire schemes and pinning several deaths on him was absurd.
All the while HSBC laundered billions for the most dangerous drug cartel in the world for years and not a single person involved will spend a day in prison, while Ross now has to spend the rest of his life behind bars.

There was a time when a large percentage of the hashrate, which by the way is already centralized by a few pools in China, had strong objections to increasing the blocksize for just this reason. Their insufficient network infrastructure would not allow block propagation to occur fast enough for efficient mining. This is no longer the case. These miners which account for nearly 80% of the global hashrate have improved their infrastructure and now claim they have the network capability to handle larger blocks without issue. This is because technology evolves quickly especially when they are economically incentivized to do so. The vast majority of miners now want and have been waiting for a HF for larger blocks. 8-9 months ago the core devs supported the Chinese miners in their quest to keep  the blocksize small but now that these same miners have improved their network infrastructure they want and have called upon the core devs to create a HF proposal that would increase the blocksize. Suddenly the core developers no longer support the Chinese miners they previously pretended to protect by keeping the blocksize small. They've twisted and nullified the HK agreement and Greg Maxwell has even changed his entire stance on the issue calling a HF for the blocksize increase the beginning of an unstoppable slippery slope that will destroy Bitcoin. This is an unconscionable argument; the contention among the different stake holders of Bitcoin the miners, the holders, the service providers, and the devs have shown that a HF is far from easy to push through. It took years for a blocksize increase to even be introduced formally via a BIP and since then miners have shifted sides to favoring an increase, holders, aside from nut jobs like MPop (I dare you to crash Bitcoin, we'll all be laughing at you within days) have shown support for an increase in blocksize, from the beginning the vast majority of service providers Have favored an increase in blocksize, and several of the original core devs including Mike Hearn, Gavin Andresen, and Jeff Garzik have supported an increase for years and have not only written supporting code, Gavin himself tested large blocks to death almost a year ago, finding no issues. These devs who have been with Bitcoin longer than nearly every other current core dev have left the core development group due to lack of participation and support from newcomers who staunchly oppose any increase to a 6 year old arbitrarily chosen constant that directly benefits their main source of funding, Blockstream who have been slow to market with all their products but have successfully run a despicable smear and censor campaign against devs and supporters of larger blocks.   Saying that a HF to increase the blocksize from 1mb to a larger limit is a slippery slope that can lead to an eventual increase in the total supply of Bitcoin is simply not reasonable. The blocksize limit was an artificially imposed arbitrary limit added in 2010 to combat spam. It's now been 6 years. Tech has changed. The code has changed. The mining has changed, the services have changed, the user base has increased exponentially, and the network infrastructure has changed more than enough to handle larger blocks but this artificial, arbitrary, temporary limit has suddenly been added by Greg and his band to the immutable list of rules set forth in the 2008 white paper which listed the way that Bitcoin inflation would be diminished over the following 140 years to a final cap at 21 millions coins. The rules from the white paper set forth the economic expectations that all Bitcoin stakeholders have come to believe are immutable and are the sole reason Bitcoin has the value it has today. At no point was this temporary limit meant to last, it was a countermeasure to spam at the time and was not an original rule from which Bitcoin's value is derived. It's time to rethink this limit and know that there is NO reason to think increasing or even completely removing it as some have proposed will lead to a slippery slope capable of destroying Bitcoin in its entirety.

First let's straighten out some terminology.  
1. A wallet, such as Electrum, is software that manages private keys (anywhere from 1-1,000s of private keys and corresponding addresses.)
2. An address, such as 1Love45FfxsQLY5yxwGXWbMRocy5rLH1gH, is a hash of the public key corresponding to a private key.  This is where you "send" transactions.
3. A private key, such as 5KZTUEMg3manF9v59eMm5by2abt1WaZS9gEn2RYb3ZVGBfsaSMc, is the code needed in order to spend the coins that have been sent to the address above, i.e. 1Love...
You should try not to reuse any addresses, and instead create new ones for each new incoming transaction.  The cost is essentially non-existent and greatly increases your financial privacy.
@_date: 2015-08-07 19:50:27
Electrum is one of hundreds of implementations of Bitcoin wallet software.  There is a reference client, known as Bitcoin Core from which nearly all clients are derived.  This client is not feasible for most users and a so called "thin-client" such as Electrum is preferred for ease of use and security.

Hey, I am the owner of this particular BTM, and so far it's been a pretty exciting and fun business venture.  I have experienced many many software and hardware issues when i first started.  We were using Robocoin hardware, and after disagreeing about how to proceed with Robocoin, they cut us off from their servers, and we were back a square 1, just over a month into operation.  But we quickly turned around, found a new partner in BitAccess, and had a brand new BTM on location within 2 weeks of Robocoin breaching our contract.  In the beginning we had some minor hardware issues related to bill jams, but the issues did not persist for very long at all after obtaining support from BitAccess.

In the U.S. In any state, at the minimum you'd need to register with FinCEN and develop and implement a written Anti-money laundering and know your customer policy along with a written risk assessment.

Engaging in the exchange of Bitcoin for USD is a licensed activity in the United States.  You must register with FinCEN on the federal level as an MSB,  before you register you must develop a written AML/KYC policy, a written risk report, and a AML/KYC training program.  You must file SARs and CTRs.  You also likely will have additional regulations to abide by at the state level, this may mean maintaining surety bonds, or limit the amount of transactions you can send, and where they can be sent to.

Bootstrap is most likely not going to work. Since headers first syncing was introduced in 0.10xx regular syncing became faster than bootstrapping.

I spent over 2 straight weeks trying to get my 2 pis to sync normally. They crashed daily and never got past 300k blocks.

That is correct, but just keeping the UTXO set isn't enough to run a wallet, nor relay blocks to other nodes, hence it does not help the network, and since it cannot run a wallet it cannot help the end user to nearly the degree a true full node does.

General Bytes was not an acceptable solution to our team, it was built upon a shaky framework that was hastily ported to work with Robocoin hardware.  Only recently has BitAccess software become available for the Robocoin hardware and we just ported our other Robocoin over to BitAccess this week, hopefully releasing it into the wild again soon.  Due to this new development we will be moving the kiosk out of Boston, loading BitAccess software and again re-release it into the wild, this time in a more Bitcoin friendly locale.
@_date: 2015-07-03 18:49:38
Lamassu had all of the same shortcomings as General Bytes, with less features. BitAccess's port is still one way but they are making progress on the 2 way and it is currently being developed. 
Yes we are likely giving the machine a second chance. Despite the Robocoin software platform being nothing more than super buggy smoke and mirrors the hardware is actually very high quality brand name bank grade equipment, so instead of taking a loss on the kiosk by selling it, we are getting a second chance with new software with a year delay. This time we will also be sure to find a more accepting community than Boston.

Hi, I own this machine, it's been out of service ever since Robocoin breached our operating agreement and cut the cord on us back in Nov 14'.  We would have kept operating as we did with our other locations, but Boston proved to be an absolutely terrible market for us.  We only ever had around a dozen customers averaging $20/transaction for the first month and a half we were in service in Boston, despite undercutting all other Boston/Cambridge Bitcoin ATMs by a full 1% and offering Bitcoin =&gt; Cash, something the other ATMs did not offer, we were not able to draw nearly enough customers to make the venture viable.
No customer data was **ever** at risk of theft, all data was kept on offsite servers.
The kiosk was listed for sale on BitPremeir for at least 6 months, and a potential buyer recently visited it an apparently forgot to properly lock the kiosk after inspecting it.

It's ridiculous to make a statement like this. For one Circle charges no fees when using a bank. Safello charges ~3%. Completely different business model. Not really comparable. Nobody is charging illegally excessive amounts. Very few if any exchanges offer no fees like Circle. Safello charging 3% is not extortionate. Also exchanges each have their own rate which commonly varies between 1-5% between exchanges. In this case the difference is about 2.5%. Very reasonable. 3% is not extortionate. 20-30% charged by Localbitcoins and some ATMs are what you could call extortionate. Not 3%

I believe you are referring to DoS not DDoS. The distributed aspect is not required to perform the recent DoS attacks on Bitcoin. The vast majority of the spam transactions were sent from a small amount of IPs not a botnet of distributed zombie computers typical of DDoS attacks.

You must not have read what I said. Safello charges 3%. Subtract 3% fees and you've got a 2.5% difference. Well within reasonable ranges between exchanges based on different continents. 
Edit: and don't forget the fact that Safello was selling at 2.5% higher than Circle means they will also buy for 2.5% higher than Circle. It's called a free market. Learn to love it.

They changed their written policy to clarify something that they were already prohibiting from doing i.e. Selling to a third  party without following applicable KYC laws and maintaining proper licensure and registration with FinCEN.  All these activities are prohibited by federal law for MSBs, Circle included. They just decided to clarify the policy and protect themselves and not allow sales to third parties under any circumstances. 
Circle is also by choice a strictly consumer company, they do not allow you to conduct any business through their platform other than consumer purchasing &amp; personal cash outs. I used to have a separate Circle account for my business, I used it for purchasing BTC for expenses, but they recently closed my account citing their strictly consumer focus.

You need to register with FinCEN, develop and codify a written AML/KYC policy, and likely register as a money transmitter in California. That would also require insurance, surety bonds and other considerations for California specifically.

That's not what I consider a manual transaction.  That's just doing a custom transaction on a Blockchain.info wallet.  A manual transaction is something like using Python Bitcoin tools to choose inputs and then writing the transactions scripts signing them and then pushing them to a full node.

The core legal issue here is really that money service businesses cannot engage in any transfer of funds originating from or used for illegal activity.  
Your new analogy is also slightly off, since Apple stands to lose economically by knowing their customer would rather circumvent copyright than purchase.  Your first analogy was actually better, and would actually work well if OP was a registered MSB, however since OP just does small transactions (from what i gather) the possibly illegal use of the funds is really not that important, since OP is already running afoul of the law by operating an unlicensed money service business.

At a minimum the UTXO (unspent transaction outputs) set needs to be kept. If A pays B 5 years ago and B never moves those coins then that transaction needs to be kept regardless of time passage otherwise if the tx were discarded after say 5 years then B could never spend the coins he was paid by A because the record of him ever owning those coins has been erased. If they are moved again after the initial payment then only the last transaction needs to be kept(assuming all coins are spent from the address).

It's cool you tried to innovate, and I certainly applaud you for it, but it's not like nobody has thought of this before, nor has this not already been implemented by large companies in a better, safer, and simpler way.

Managing change is so expensive that banks no longer exchange it for customers who don't have accounts with them. Sometimes they won't if you don't use that branch.  Coinstar(Outerwall) already charges 10.9% for change into cash. Now change into bits and it's like adding a bitcoin ATM into the mix which also charge on average between 7-12%.  So basically you'd be looking at 20% conversion for change into bits.

They were shut down overnight with no notice given to operators. They forced an update in breach of our contracts and the update also broke a ton of AML BSA regulations so when 70+% of the operators rebelled they shut down and rebranded to Romit (Vomit) and that disintegrated very quickly. Jordan is still out there scamming tho but his rep is pretty bad at this point. They can be repurposed but need all new software and some new hardware. Not easy. First kit that came out turned it into a Lammasu gen1 which was non compliant. And turned a $22k machine into a huge clone of a $1k machine. Since then others have done their own kits and most are kept in-house not sold to the public.

You have no business sense. You can't just choose a price point and go from there. For this sort of venture you need to first find the requirements of the node, all the minimum stats needed to run a node. Then find hardware that fits the specs then you determine how much it costs. You'll likely find that $176/unit is pretty good at a small scale.   You can't just start at hey let's make it $75 and expect the components you need to be available below cost.

That I am unsure of, however I DO know they have a very good relationship with their Bank Silicon Valley Bank, so opening many accounts is easy for them, also no real exchange like Coinbase has 1 bank account, they are required by law to have operating accounts, service accounts, and separate accounts for holding customer funds.
Also if you truly believe in Bitcoin why would you keep fiat in an FDIC account anyway (the FDIC can only fund about 0.05% of insured deposits if that much). Isn't that the point of "being your own bank"?
I use Bitcoin primarily for holding (other than my full-time job operating BTMs), but am becoming a big time BTC spender (always rebuy instantly), properly using it to get big discounts on items I order everyday.

It's generally called enhanced KYC because they are no longer just a psudeo-exchange, but a fully fledged exchange they have to collect much more info.  the direct deposit level of verification is only for $50,000+ daily So no It's not a lot of information, imagine if a customer wanted to deposit $over 10m/month, that requires a lot more than your cell phone number and.or email address.
Under KYC laws if you have a customer who ties deposits over $10k  in day, under the BSA, and other KYC laws you must collect much more information, such as source of funds, proof of employment, home address, income, etc.  
Yes it's a bit extreme but the law was in place long before Bitcoin. MSBs are considered toxic to most banks for the last 2 decades due to the incredibly high level of compliance required.

CampBX still had a bank account then, CoinMKT, Kraken, and Coinsetter were all up and running for months. I mentioned the names of these other exchanges, she had never heard of any of them; I was flabbergasted that she was starting a Bitcoin exchange before doing ANY Research into the existing industry.

No never been sued, because my business model never holds customer funds for more than a few minutes at a time (I operate BTMs).

It's BitBet so yes. It's a provably fair prediction market. If it's the same as the last time I checked them out for each "bet", for example "will Trump be the President Elect on Dec 1, 2016?", bets are taken from the public with no requirement to register an account of any kind by posting 2 addresses for each bet, one to bet Yes and another to bet No. The odds and payouts change with each subsequently placed bet and are all displayed on the bet page since each transaction to the Yes address or the No address will be recorded and change the overall market outlook on the bet % wise. I don't know how this model could be made provably fair and transparent in another fashion. I suppose they could use an x-pub key for an HD wallet with the page code set to generate and display a new address for each subsequent page visit, but since they'd likely want to keep the x-pub key hidden until after the bet is resolved or bets are stopped, it would degrade the transparency of the current model and could lose bettor trust. 
That said I've never used them I just like the concept of prediction markets and they give some public insight for impending events.

As a fellow BSA compliant and regulated entity, I unfortunately have to side with Jesse and Kraken's own compliance policy. There are strict rules about this in the BSA and the regulated entity, In this case Kraken, cannot tell you, being the person whose account is accused of "suspicious" behavior, cannot be told why anything is being investigated and often times investigations and reports are made without even the ability to inform the person whose account is in question. It's not really a fair system at all, but it's the regulatory climate we currently live in and we must abide by its rules most often resulting in cryptic responses such as the ones posted by OP. There is no doubt customers would benefit from being kept up to speed on the status of the allegedly "suspicious" account but, We as BSA regulated entities cannot act in this manner without running afoul of BSA and or other AML regulations ourselves which could put all our customers funds and our own at risk of seizure by the federal government.

They have added direct deposit for high volume users it requires extensive investigation from their AML team Before approval, my application entered last week is still processing even though I have a very long/term high volume relationship with coinbase confirming my personal account with my business account coinbase support removed all my limits after a $100 transaction due to my extensive history with them.  
they have FDIC insured USD vaults for users in some states mine included 0 fees to ach in 0 fees to ach out..  Their Bitcoin is held primarily offline and is insured by AON which is the insurance company for insurance companies. 
I don't see any value in writing what would essentially need to be cashiers checks to pay for anything as that defeats the purpose of Bitcoin, with the volatility  we've been experiencing over the past few years any delay in the banking system generally 2-3 business days would really destroy that idea. Bill pay is a good idea but not for coinbase. circle came into the game focusing on consumers only after deciding to drop their merchant processing project months ago. There are several bill payment processors who accept Bitcoin already and I'm sure one will be heavily funded and become a success, but in the interest of decentralization (that's why we're here right?) why try to centralize more services to a single entity? Seems highly counter intuitive to me.

False.  You **CAN** withdraw from MtGox, their system is backlogged, but it is possible.

It's absolutely ridiculous to think of the BTC market this way, i have many times sold BTC, but never once wired money out.    This is is because I do not have a need to wire it out.  I keep it in MtGox's Bank, for trading purposes.  This is because I am a trader, and a long term investor.  I move in and out of the BTC market facilitating the exchange, but my funds never leave Tokyo, be they USD or BTC.  (for security purposes i do not keep sizable amounts of BTC on Gox for more than 24hrs).  Are you trying to say that my trades don't count somehow because i didn't wire USD out before wiring it back incurring 4,000 yen fees before buying back into BTC?  Was there not someone on the other side of my trades? Did the market disregard my trades and make them like an orphan block that never gets included in the blockchain?

From the MtGox Site.
"SEPA Withdrawals:
Due to the daily withdrawal limits imposed by our European bank, all fund transfers to SEPA accounts in Europe will take several weeks depending on the size of your withdrawal. International wire transfers are an alternative method you can choose.
International Wire Transfers:  
At the moment we are manually processing wire transfers and have a slight backlog as we create a new withdrawal system with our banking partners. Your withdrawal may take two weeks or more depending on the amount.
Your patience and understanding in processing withdrawals is greatly appreciated.
Due to the daily withdrawal limits imposed by our European bank, all fund transfers to SEPA accounts in Europe may take up to 3 weeks. If you urgently require the withdrawal of your funds please cancel your SEPA withdrawal request and apply for an international bank transfer."

Not including MtGox in any calculation means to completely ignore a majority of the market in your calculation.  Gox is still by and far the largest exchange with the most influence in the market overall.
Edit. Everyday on this sub people go spouting about Gox being dead and Bitstamp is the new king.  It's not Gox still does 2x the transactions Bitstamp does on a BTC basis which for the bitcoin market is all that truly matters. Lots of people may dislike Gox and it's  past troubles.

You dont understand that US laws do not apply to the international community as a whole?  because that is my point.  There are lots and lots of legal gray areas surrounding bitcoin  this is because bitcoin, unlike us, operates in a post-national world.  National boundries, laws, and rules mean ABSOLUTLEY NOTHING to BTC.   I don't believe its right, moral, ethical, nice, or anything to steal large amounts of anything (money) from anybody.  I am by no means defending this guy or Bernie Madoff or anybody else.  what i am trying to say is that the US SEC cannot and should not intervene in Bitcoin economics.  The only way regulations could exist in Bitcoin, without undermining the entire purpose, is if there was an independent entity created solely for the purpose of regulating BTC securities

And as i expanded upon my original idea of customer service for BTC related services this idea could work outside of the BTC industry as well.  Distributed, work from home, microjobs.

I did a very similar thing except I gave a hologram sealed paper wallet in a ziplock bag to my cousin as a premature Christmas gift for his son who will be born in February.  I gave it to him as he was walking out the door and he didnt know what to do with it.  I told him think of it like a savings bond.  Lock it away and maybe it'll be worth something a couple years from now.
Also because I have a job in bitcoin, I've already had to explain the basics to most of my family over the last couple gatherings. While it goes straight over my grandparents heads (they can't figure out how TiVo works and they've had one for 6+ years), the rest all had at the very least a mild interest.  So in order to foster that interest at the end of the conversation I send them each some mBTC to their emails via Coinbase.  That way it skips all the technical know how of pirv keys and paper wallets, and can go straight into an account that is pretty self explanatory.  None of my family would be interested in cashing out anything either, they see it more as an investment like a savings bond, rather than a $50 bill in a Christmas card

Forex brokers charge low fees based on economies of scale. If they didnt have huge volume of transactions. Their fees would never cover their costs. Be happy about 0.55% fees. True traders see 10% arbitrage opportunities across the exchanges and don't give a shit about 0.55% fees.  The arbitrage opportunities  in bitcoin that do not exist in traditional forex (I mean that in terms of degree of arbitrage not existence of arbitrage) allows for traders to not worry about fees that in traditional forex terms are excessive

One particular instance in which I was considering the practicality of a 51% attack involves an unexpected massive event such as a widespread blackout in the us. Hundreds of th/s would disappear from the network. And the entire dynamic of the mining environment would change.  A large scale attacker such combined with ddos on big pools and this massive outage could effectively lever an attack on the network.  Clearly this isn't practical and relies on a massive blackout occurring and then malicious miners being ready for the hashrate drop but kind of a scary concept due to the fact that I believe most of the global hashrate lies within the us and the us power grid has experienced massive failure in the last decade

You have gone off on a tangent about the transfer exchange value for USD.  This is not what I've been talking about AT ALL.  I am talking about the price of BTC, set by the market as free market economies work, and the market includes EVERY SINGLE TRADE that occurs on EVERY SINGLE exchange, if you think otherwise then you're absolutely retarded.  Bloomberg would be interested in where most of the action takes place right?  oh wait no they prefer to ignore 44% of the market because you can't have cash in hand today when you sold your BTC.

I apologize I regret the way i titled this. I said cash back because the free debit card I linked that PayPal offers for free with an account. You can find the terms there. They offer 1% cash back on debit purchases.  The card also allows for instantaneous cash withdrawals at any ATM MasterCard is accepted. For a hefty fiat fee from both PayPal and the ATM owner of course.

This is a complex issue. Hardware has already blown way past any level that consumers can really obtain and operate feasibly so it's sort of inevitable that mining will move to the cloud where they are hosted in data centers that have cheap power cold air and fast Internet.   At the moment Ghash.io the biggest public mining hoster and they only allow mining on their pool right now. This means the hardware and their hashing power is centralized  They claim to have plans to allow mining on third party pools which is something that would allow hashing to remain decentralized although some hardware is physically centralized at a data center that provides hardware support for the chips. 
I think that we will see increasing amounts of hardware centralization due to the ASIC arms race but I do believe the community knows decentralization is essential and as these new services emerge they will add abilities to decentralize the network across pools even though the hardware may be centralized

I use the gliph app, coinbase app, and blockchain apps regularly on my iPhone with no problems. Don't update !
