I've bought my first 0.01 bitcoins yesterday. I'm happy I did that but I got a bit more money ready to spend. My current tactic is waiting for it to dip a little bit after the weekend (Tuesday) and then spend my remaining money. 
But let's assume Bitcoin will hit 14 000 dollar at Christmas. I'm looking at [the Kraken graphs]( Now it is at 11 600 while it dipped to 10 800 yesterday. Let's say you bought them now and not waiting it to dip to around 10 800 again. That would make that 1 coin 800 dollars more expensive. Let's look at what profit difference for Christmas: 
- 10 800 to 14 000 is a 29,6% increase
- 11 600 to 14 000 is a 20,6% increase
We are looking at a 3 weeks period only. They both have a very generous increase. But you probably wanna hold on to it for a longer period and that will result in smaller differences if the number grows even larger. I'd say above 75% of people here are confident in a continued grow next year. 
I'm not sure where I was going with that but I'm gonna wait till next week. But I kinda have a feeling you should simply buy at the next small dip. Not right now because it's at an all time high peek.
