@_date: 2017-12-08 12:56:55
It really changed my life. After a year of me doing it my BF started doing it too. He was totally against it at first (calling it my starvation diet) but now he loves it. He'll eat lunch if it's convenient/employer buys it. Otherwise he just eats at night and drinks as much beer as he wants. Beer belly is gone though. :)

Check out:   .  Depending on your cost of living it is possible.  For instance if you invest $1m and spend $40k a year (low I know for a parent with two kids).  Better to just set up some college funds for them and wait until they're out of school.  Start maxing out those 401ks, roth IRAs and HSAs!

No snacks, that breaks the fast.  I have black coffee or diet coke in the mornings, then a lot of water throughout the day.  A few times I have actually needed to eat something, which you'll know the difference between that and wanting to eat.  If I get really hungry I'll drink flavored hot tea (raspberry tea or chamomile or something), usually keeps hunger at bay.
Ultimately you realize skipping one or several meals in a row isn't a big deal.  I'm hungry, so what?  I'm also still a bit overweight.  We're adults, right?  Of course this is true for 80% of people and not like nursing mothers and shit like that. But it's healthy for most, even for diabetics as long as they are monitored. (One study: 
The benefits are so numerous though, I absolutely love it.  We shop less and spend less money buying food, less dishes, less clean up.  Less planning.  I found it mentally exhausting before to have to meal plan all these meals and snacks for two people on a budget and make sure we're both happy.  I'm a short woman and 1200 calories is my goal every day which is often 1 "normal" meal at a restaurant.  I used to have to try to order off the kids menu which is kind of embarrassing although it shouldn't be. I don't have to be the person that goes out with her friends and just eats a side salad (dressing on the side!) and one glass of white wine because that's the calorie limit for the day.  I can have a burger and maybe some fries and still be within my calories.  Holiday Parties? No problem, I fasted all day I have 1200 calories to burn!  I can eat pasta (which is a lot cheaper than shirataki noodles), pizza (also cheap and delicious).  Of course I have to balance this with veggies cause nutrients and fiber and whatnot.  Knowing that I don't eat during the day makes it easy to say no when coworkers bring in shit.  I feel more focused at work.  In fact it's only until after I eat my first meal that I start to feel tired and lazy.
Anyways.  It's been a lifesaver for me.  Society feeds us "breakfast is the most important meal of the day" bullshit because companies like Kelloggs sponsor studies to prove that's true.  They say we should eat a bunch of snacks throughout the day but that's fucking bullshit and always made me more hungry and binge.  Companies don't make money when you fast so you won't likely read about it in magazines.  And I've been doing this for a year and a half and I find people feel VERY threatened when you skip meals.  Like irrationally so.  My BFs coworkers BUY HIM LUNCH while my coworkers lecture me and tell me how unhealthy I am.  It's crazy.
Sorry for the essay I am very passionate about it because it's been so good for my BF and I.  I lost 30 lbs the first 8 months and I got to go out to eat, drink, etc.
tl;dr: no, no snacks before 15-18 hours of fasting.

Check out: 
My BF could definitely retire on that.  We spent last year in an RV and really only need $10k+ passive income to go back to that lifestyle and live comfortably (working at national parks and shit probably 6-8 months of the year).  That's our idea of retirement.  We're hoping to accomplish this with rental properties so when we don't want to work &amp; RV anymore we can just sell the properties and live in some LCOL area (Mexico, Thailand, etc.)
It's DEFINITELY possible.

I fast for 15-22 hours a day depending on what I'm feeling like.  Actually after you get over the initial few days of "aren't I supposed to be eating??" you don't get that hungry (especially if you do Keto).  Eventually you will likely get to the point where you don't care if your hunger, and it stops affecting you in ways you can't control (snapping at coworkers).  Drink a lot of water.  :)
and some others are okay.  There is a war with Keto vs non Keto fasting.  I do non-keto (really anything I want) and there are too many benefits to list here. I will never go back to eating 3 meals a day.

Check out  it's an interesting website.  It will run every possible scenario of the market as it has performed in the last 100 years.  I know past performance doesn't indicate future performance, but it runs through all the possibilities to see how likely you are to go broke with portfolio $X to make it through Y years of retirement with spending $Z/year.  You can also make adjustments to see how it would affect things to keep working for a few years, to adjust your spending say 5% a year if your portfolio took a hit, etc.

I meant the mentality in this sub couldn't be different from the question of "did my bank just steal from me?"  It was a joke, obviously, of a question taken out of context.  I think many of people interested in Bitcoin are interested because of the general feeling that the banking industry is corrupt and people would like to have more control over their money.  
I would love to have a realistic alternative to a bank that I could "trust," because you're absolutely right I don't want to keep my life savings in a Trezor.

Yeah people (media) are constantly asking him about things he isn't in, just to get sensational quotes like this one.

Anyone who would answer I would flunk." "

I lament about my "lost" gainz not buying in 2010, or 2013 when I opened a wallet but didn't do anything with it.  Then I remember it was kind of difficult to get BTC.  You couldn't buy with a VISA/MC/Bank account (IIRC), I remember wanting to put about $100 into it (about a whole btc) but it ended up being a pain in the ass to get.  Anyways, just something I tell myself to soften the sting of regret.

Traveling, hiking and volunteering... have you considered full time RVing for some of your retirement? National Parks and such will provide a full hookup site in return for volunteering (usually 20 hours/week). It is THE best way to see the parks, as you get to know them over a period of time. We took a year off and RV'd last year it was by far the best year of our lives. We just need passive income to really feel comfortable doing it. I imagine though we could get by very well with $5-$10k/year passive income and only have to work part time for 6-9 months of the year.

This is antedotal, but recently used cryptos to easily exchange money digitally with people IRL.
Case 1: my sister is across the country and loaned me money by taking USD to my bank branch in her city and depositing it.  I don't have that choice to pay her back.  Her bank is not in my city.  I got a new bank account in the new city and two boxes of checks here are $100!!  Can you believe that?!  So I sent her some Ether and BTC (instantly) which she can send to coinbase and deposit it in her bank.
Case 2: I live with my boyfriend.  We just moved across the country.  We both have accounts at bank B.  No local branches for bank B here.  I can't deposit cash OR money orders into bank B.  I can deposit checks, but it takes several days to clear.  I work a temp job that gives me a fucking pay card, I can't do direct deposit into Bank B for some ridiculous reason (customer service won't help me).  I open an account at a local bank, bank A.  Now I can get cash, etc.  But checks are super expensive. 
I have money in bank A and bank B.  I need to give my bf $$ for something (rent, groceries, hookers and blackjack... who knows?!), even though we share the same (big) bank, I cannot transfer money (between accounts) to him, if I give him cash he can't deposit it, the one thing we can do is I can write him a check from bank b to bank b, and he can "mobile deposit" it.  Despite the fact that it's coming from a checking account in good standing in the same bank, it takes no less than 3 business days to clear.
So I send him bitcoins next time.
The current banking system is broken in various obvious ways.  The fact that my new bank wants to charge me $100 for two books of checks, I can't wire money from them without a ridiculous fee, and they monitor how much currency I have (they report any suspicious activity -- I was told "for instance we know you work at taco bell and you deposit $5k cash we're going to report that to the government"), they report to the government anyone that transacts more than $10k in a day (not net $10k, but gross.  So you take out $8k for a used car, and another $3k for whatever, then you don't buy the car and deposit $8k back in the same account the same day, they still fucking report you).  
I'm just saying, banks are a pain in the ass.  I believe in BTC 100%, but even if I didn't, it would be still be more convenient for me to use it than traditional banks.  I am still paying my sister off and I can send her btc after traditional banks close, with lower transaction fees and lower wait time.
