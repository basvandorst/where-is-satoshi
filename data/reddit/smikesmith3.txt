Haha...same thing here man...though my 'High Risk' was a single BTC...
So I guess we are kinda the same.

Yikes...this gives me no reassurance at this time.  Especially the refunding of the money part that didn't happen yet.
If they don't honor the price and send coins, then okay that really sucks...but to NOT refund the money!!!  WOWOWOWOWOWOWOWOW!
I wonder if they don't send it back since you sent a ticket???

Already done it.  Thanks for the advice.  Really appreciate it.
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:34:23
I'll admit, my first purchase was a sliver of some coin...went through great, didn't really expect 1 though to be such a big deal.

S w e e t.   Thanks!

One can only hope.

Checked bank account. They never even took the money. Same with you?
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:12:58
Let me know.  I had an account setup 2 weeks ago, tried to buy 1 single bitcoin and I'm high risk.  About an hour before I was supposed to get it...oddly enough, the absolute second I logged into my Coinbase account I got the email about it.  Not sure if that is coincidence.

This may be a really dumb question. Cant you request money order? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:33:36
Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:33:41
My first purchase was 1. Same thing. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 01:42:46
Sorry bud, is dead...
Got nothing else, and sadly I can't stop as I already started.
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:02:22
Understood. Used them a fee times before and never seen them pull money in 24 hours. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:07:36
I tried the same amount but ya know... I'm high risk
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:33:21
Thanks for the help.  Lesson learned.

I got one reply with a generic answer. How the heck did you get any reply? It has been upwards of 21 days since I emailed support. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 00:32:25
Monday the 4th was when I bought, supposed to clear today.
I did buy a sliver of one for 20 bucks that went through.  Don't know what the threshold is.
Like reported, some do go through.  I have my emails into support but ya....who knows how long that will be.
@_date: 2013-11-26 19:12:58
Well that was WAY too easy.  Thanks!!!
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:43:22
Well that is interesting...
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:32:07
Dang...bought at 530
@_date: 2013-11-05 00:47:39
Would love to move forward with coinkite!  Can you send an invite? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:16:04
Huh...Can someone confirm that?  They attempted to pull the $530 so wouldn't that mean that is what they are taking at that time?
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:50:05
Speaking from the VERY basic level.
And I was rather excited about them water heaters at the time...
@_date: 2013-12-18 14:16:02
Do you know if that is immediately when you sell it or when it has been sold a few days later?
