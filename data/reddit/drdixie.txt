Most here woild say no depending on the amount if coin, but I feel safe keeping &lt;1k usd in my blockchain. I never hold on coinbase.

Wait so we've gone from a Ponzi Scheme to airline miles (something which actually has value)?
That's progress.
@_date: 2017-10-29 14:17:16
You can't. But they have reviews and I always buy from the same seller. Just buy a small amount. I normally send $50 and get $130 in gift cards.

He is a major stake holder in Citibank. Wonder if he might be biased...
@_date: 2017-10-29 16:04:03
Do you trust coinbase to not go bankrupt?
Do you trust them to give you your forked coins?
Do you trust the banksters with your crypto?
The whole point of btc is not to trust.
@_date: 2018-02-02 06:26:45
Lol you must be new. Gdax lets you buy and sell woth no fees. But keep up the nonsense.

Would you like a pizza?
@_date: 2018-02-02 07:00:09
Y'all need to chill tf out. If you bought early then you're up tons. Relax and believe in the system you invested in. If you bought high relax, you invested in an infant technology that we believe will revolutionize the world. 
Of course we'd all like new highs everyday, but c'mon we all know that's not realistic. Get away from the price checking. Go for a run, swim, walk. Talk to a friend you haven't in a while. Go smell a flower. There's more to life then "sick gains". Live for now cuz tomorrow ain't guaranteed.
Bitcoin will be back. It always has. And if this is the true death of bitcoin  (it's not) then we all got an amazing education in basic computer science, human emotion,  and finance. 
Much love to yall. This sub has been awesome.

Because most people here hodl bitcoin. If the split does occur the values of holdings could be severely diminished. Hence, the anxiety.
@_date: 2017-07-12 15:57:43
No. The closest analogy I can give you is when a stock splits. You would have more coins but they would be worth less. In this case, it is more likely one chain would outperform the other in the medium to long term.
@_date: 2019-05-28 02:46:18
