No, a scam is fraud.  I am not giving you any information that is untrue.  Like any investment, you should understand the implications of such an investment.  However, there are 7 billion people in the world.  That means that to be in the first 1000 people to join puts you at the very top, and nearly guarantees that you make money with this.
As always, it is totally up to you to invest or not to invest.  I hope you make the right decision, allowing yourself to get into the game before everyone else!

That is so awesome, I'm going to have to implement that next time I make a site that has to do with bitcoin.  How have I never noticed that before?

A pyramid scheme is not a scam.  Please Google the difference. 
A scam is when we say we're doing something we're not (example taking your money).
A pyramid is when people can invest and get paid.  That's exactly what we are.  We are giving you a fair chance to make money, and you will be paid.  In a scam, we just take your money and run.

I felt that this would be rather useful, as it encourages people to get into bitcoin and is one of the applications for it.

Great to hear!  Make sure to post a positive review (and your referral link) on our BitcoinTalk discussion!

It is not a scam.  There is no deceit.  It is strictly up to you to research pyramid schemes and decide if you feel it is a good idea to become the 6th member of one (it's not like opportunities like this come around often).

Um thanks I think....
Nowhere in there does it say it is a scam, and the key to pyramid schemes is to get in at the very start, and then when people come after you make money.

That's not totally true.  We are not doing anything that we don't explain we're doing on our website.  That is the definition of a scam. 
Before investing in anything, it is purely your responsibility to do your research.  At the current stage, investment is perfect reasonable as it is in the early stages.
The thing about the law is that it depends were you are.  Here in Panama, you can do just about anything legally on the internet.  We consulted several lawyers to ensure that we did not partake in any illegal activities in the creation of this website.  I hope you enjoy!

Exactly!  Our product is amazing, and it's unfortunate that people go and judge it as a scam right away.  It is a very legitimate website, and we hope that many people enjoy it.

That could be the longest full story I've ever read.  Regardless, very informative.  Thank you for the post!

Keep in mind that it may take a long time (if ever) to receive a payout if you only invested a small amount, as your changes are a lot higher when you invest greater amounts.  See [our rules]( for more information about our selection process.

It is if you're the person getting in at the very start.  And that's why you should go do it right now!  It's the very key to your success in a pyramid scheme.  Just by depositing 1 BTC now, if 1000 people come after you could be making 10 or 20 times that amount.
