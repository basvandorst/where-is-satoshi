Youre a fucking idiot, they havent invented revival machines yet, Thats literally Why theyre freezing their corpses.

A steering wheel like that looks extremely unlikely in the future, if there even is one.
@_date: 2019-11-13 16:55:30
Cool ad bro
@_date: 2017-11-25 18:17:10
at lunch yesterday I was picking between two meals because on costs 12,5€ and the other one 13€. 
During the meal I bought 0,25 BTC, lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:35:51
i bought on 6,6k lel
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:48:44
@_date: 2017-11-06 21:03:31
I bought at 5,5k and it went down to 3k (I bought over 1 BTC)
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:39:14
Bitcoin Can be remodelled without changing name. Thats the difference...
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:20:25
Might be relative to a larger Price so your input is irrelevant
@_date: 2017-11-27 06:55:09
That is insane... The only notifications you got during 10 hours was from Coinbase!

Lol do you even know about spacex:s major groundbreaking rocket science breakthroughs?
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:11:15
6,6k (Only bought for 1,2k)
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:39:08
holy shit all you post is FUD and spam on all Bitcoin threads... You jealous you haven't bought in yet? :)
@_date: 2017-09-25 12:14:10
In two months? Nah It'll be around 6k
@_date: 2018-11-14 06:23:43
Is it for sale?
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:56:20
nice fud
@_date: 2017-09-12 12:24:35
Keep in mind, people including journalists who ever spoke for BTC will always be for BTC and hope that it succeeds, so they can tell everyone about it and link to old articles.

Buying bitcoin at an ATM*
@_date: 2017-09-21 22:58:22
Well, I'm still not biased at all, other than all the bullshit between the BCH / BTC fanatics that is unevitable. I don't see a reason for them not to co-exist. 
with a higher security, BTC could be a currency for larger investments and settlements, while BCH could be the faster alternative for everyday shopping and such! Just my two-cents.
@_date: 2017-09-24 16:18:23
Yeah because everyone would like to see "0.00674 Bitcoin" and calculate that for themselves instead of using a set fiat currency and automatically converting the BTC
@_date: 2017-09-21 23:14:24
Bittrex is a good platform for trading coins :)
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:57:28
Maybe because every business in the world wont accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-08 11:02:48
@_date: 2017-09-08 10:59:39
Well, fiat doesn't have a limit on how much currency can be in circulation, so if BTC becomes a well-known and widely used currency it will not drop until something better shows up.
@_date: 2017-09-17 10:23:52
You're terrible at spreading bearish thoughts.

I'm calling 6000 USD in December 2017.

You could try contacting a seller of BTC ATM's and see if they can offer a large-order discount.
10 Bars purchase one atm each = 10% disc
50 bars purchase one atm each = 20% disc
150 bars = 35% disc
@_date: 2017-10-24 05:16:24
Extremely misleading. 
Either you're trying to manipulate idiots, or the idiot is yourself.

Just buy a hardware wallet. It's a small investment that you should really get
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:19:59
Dip to 4,4k then up to 8k+ :)
@_date: 2017-09-21 23:02:30
That's true, and that's where I would probably go about 70/30 on BTC, since they were first to the table and they're WAAAAY more established around the world.
@_date: 2017-09-25 13:07:42
Well, there's a selection of them, and I'd recommend googling on it and finding out what would suit you the most.
Trezor is one of the most used wallets atm:
Here's a list of great hardware wallets!

The big masses wouldn't adopt Bitcoin unless the majority could profit off of it.
@_date: 2017-10-30 15:37:51
@_date: 2017-09-04 20:31:03
You're an idiot.
Let's say one bitcoin is worth 1000 dollars. You have exactly 2000 dollars and you buy two bitcoins.
Now let's say it was 2000 dollars for one BTC. You now only buy one.
If the value of a BTC now hits 200k dollars you will either have 200k or 400k depending on when you bought, so your logic is fucking retarded
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:37:33
I bought at 4600 :D
