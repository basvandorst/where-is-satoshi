Thank you so much for your generous and well thought out donations to good causes. Your story is like a fairy tale come true!
One thing I'm curious about is how you held off from cashing in your Bitcoins for so long.
Unless you already had as much money as you needed for the rest of your life, at some stage there must have been a point where your Bitcoin holdings became a significant part of your savings, and later enough on which to live comfortably - You'd won the game and could choose to be financially secure for life or hold onto the Bitcoins as a gamble for no real personal advantage but risk losing it all.
How did you choose not to take the former, very tempting offer?

How many times would you double-check the recipient address before making a transfer like that?

Email them at donate and let them know you'll donate when they put Bitcoin alongside credit cards and Paypal on their donations page.

Perhaps also put out a request for people to provide help that doesn't need programming skills, eg creating sensible test data, testing, etc

But this is a hardware product made in factory somewhere. Even if the company publishes the hardware design it doesn't mean that that's what they're manufacturing. It's different to open source software where the source can be published, reviewed and then compiled by the reviewers.

QR codes will look different depending on the redundancy settings with which they're created, and possibily from other variations as well.

As more companies roll out hardware wallets, what certainty is there that those wallets are trustworthy other than saying "This company's been around for a while and seems legit"?

I think you should add "Exchange rate" under fees as the buy/sell spread is essentially a fee.
