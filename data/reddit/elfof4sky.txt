I searched Satoshi Citadel Industries in Google Play and a shoddy bitcoin wallet called Bitbit came up. The few reviews I read gave me the impression the wallet is shoddy and not currently supported.

What makes an altcoin solid? It's marketing team? it's ICO? It's group of code tweakers or devs if you prefer? It's ubiquitous network? Its decentralized nature? It's POW? I coukd go on, I guess I'm just wondering if this solid alt actually exists. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 17:18:50
I wasn't really guessing, I just wanted to give you the right answer to the question that was asked without making you feel like an ass for asking it or not knowing the answer and just being angry in general. Still downvoted. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 21:14:36
While those contribute to solidity, without decentralization the alt can't be considered solid. If it can't stand on its own it is not solid. Every alt has a centralized weakness, and we're it not for Bitcoin's resilience against authority, the alts would 'll be successfully banned. Imho
@_date: 2018-01-13 12:25:57
10 minute blocks are what makes the network the most secure in the Solar System. That's 10 minutes of 16 exahashes per second of work that needs to be surpassed to make a change to it as I understand it. Much easier to do with faster blocktimes. It's why exchanges wait for more confirmations from some alts than others. Security.

Well raising the blocksize is not backward compatible. Unlike 2nd and 3rd layer scaling can be undone and replaced. Making it bigger is a last resort. Leave it to the experts who actually build this shit. There is a reason they do it this way and not the seemingly obvious way. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 11:39:12

@_date: 2017-12-25 18:14:39
Correct me if Im wrong but isn't a blocksize increase notbackwards comparable. The 2nd and 3rd layer solutions for scaling such as segwitdont change bitcoin at all so they can be easily removed/replaced without rewriting bitcoin. Perhaps this can be better explained. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:07:29
It's a pretty good analogy because you can deposit a gold eagle into your bank account. You get the decreed value for it which is 50 bucks. You deposit a bitcoin in your coinbase (bank) account, it can be traded within that bank for its perceived value, not a value that was decreed. See? A really perfect analogy as its government struck legal tender. Copper and Nickle are hard assets that also make up our coinage too, yet we both agree they are made into fiat currency.   
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:05:44
To add to this, each miner picks a starting point called a nonce, and begin guessing from there. That "pattern" of the hash of current blah blah blah is that the hash needs to begin with a certain number of zeros. When the math problem difficulty needs to be adjusted the algoryth simply adds or subtracts a zero or more reqiured at the start of the hash

And you won girlfriend. She's seems like a keeper. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:41:50
A bitcoin is worth one bitcoin but it is not currency by decree. And while our perception of value of bitcoin changes our perception of the price of goods change not the value of a dollar. Take gold Eagles. They are decreed to be 50 dollars. They are fiat even though their value is more.

No it's more involved than that. You do it on a computer and printer that have zero internet access in the history of their existences, and will never see the internet in their futures.

Okay. So your transaction is low priority because of the small fee. Don't delete any wallets. And just wait it out. That's all you can do. It will either go through or get returned. Most likely go through. In the meanwhile, get yourself a Segwit wallet like Samurai et al and use that from now on.

Good point.  So you are saying censorship is objective, ie the thing is censored.  I am suggesting the viewer is censored from receiving the material which may or may not be relevant but can't be determined do to its vanished nature.  I find (and I think you must agree with me) that as a reader I would rather determine my access to knowledge rather than by a subgroup that is easily offended.  It's just etiquette to not hide material from others.  
Edit: grammar

I know what might help you to get art. Try making art. Imagine something creative that doesn't already exist and go try and create it. I offer this unsolicited advice because to go through life without being moved by art is akin to going through life without falling in love. Don't be cynical, just be open to the experience. I appreciate music for example much more when I either imagine myself playing one of the instruments, or that it is being played or sung right in front of me. For me visual art is different. I don't need to imagine myself painting it, but I marvel at the results of the artist. Some art seems to capture the spirit of the artist, and those are the best. I also love some of the work by Kandinski, because he makes you see things that aren't even there.

Hortstu the expansion is the increase in value of btw coupled with its divisibility.  You are looking at bitcoins like they are separate from one another and if you think about it, they are only mined separately.  In theory they are one and the same, and 1 btw is a division based on the mining process and result.  It is not a thing to count really unless you own one.  BAM!

I have the coinbase app, and mycelium on my phone.  I want to send bitcoin to my coinbase app from mycelium.  I open coinbase but there is no bitcoin address to send to.  I can generate a qr on my app, but how do I scan it for a payment while in mycelium?  It also seems to require I enter an amount in coinbase to recieve.  No thanks, I'd rather determine this from where I send the money.  How can I find my address for a simple and convenient copy and paste maneuver?  Is there a 'good' reason this isn't obvious?

As you use it, the concept of blockchain, and offline storage becomes a solid understanding.  We tend to think of the bitcoins as having value, but really the value is contained by the blockxhain. And bitcoins merely permit you to access that.  So when you make a paper wallet or cold storage all you do is take the accessibility out of your technology and put it elsewhere.  Practice.

So to be clear, say from blockchain I'd open my options from the 'send' screen they are 'quick send' custom send, or 'shared send.'  I see no entry field for a second or return address.  Am I barking up the wrong tree?  Another unclear (excuse my genuine ignorance but you will only have to tell me once) concept is, 'in order to overspend and therefore receive change, the address you are sending to is pre-formatted to only receive a certain amount, otherwise all your bitcoin sent will arrive at initial address and non will be returned except maybe by request. If this is the case and I send 6bt to a 5btc request for payment (and I set up a change address in order to receive 1btc back) Why would this be done?  Why would or how would I end up needing change to a perfectly divisible crypto?  Thankyou.

The coins aren't in your phone, the coins are always on the network.  You have keys on your phone.  A wallet would better be called a keychain.  The keys gain entry into the blockchain to transfer ownership of bitcoin which stay on the network.  When you lose your keys the bitcoins are still there forever.

Except for the part about the "right regulation being good for bitcoin, but proposed regulation bad".  Look, this is politics.  Bitcoin doesn't need regulation.  Circle and xapo are creating two options by determining the argument.  This is nasty politics, don't fall for it.  Bitcoin doesn't need ANY regulation except from manipulators like Lawsky, and Allaire.

No, money is a store of value. I've read this backward version that money is a ledger of account. It gives the impression of "whoa never thought of it like that before!" But that's because money isn't a ledger of account. Bitcoin is a ledger of account and ledgers of accounts are ledgers of accounts. Money is a store of value.

@_date: 2016-06-10 10:50:57
I'm confused. So there is an obvious pin code that you open for the robber. He sends bitcoin to his own address seemingly? But actually sent it to a designated cold storage which you can access later and the robber doesn't learn the difference?  Couple problems with this.  People can use this to rob people themselves by not actually purchasing. And the receiving wallet isn't going to cooperate with this trickery. So the robber will see it being sent but not see it arrive.  I likely misunderstand you though 
@_date: 2016-06-22 12:40:15

Oh so you mean to develop concensus. We need code to develop scaling privacy solutions and all that. I think when people see good code that functions correctly and maintains the essence of decentralization concensus will be built. The big problem we face and this is a problem we face in ourselves with everything is our inability to reason.  A lot of people who have taken sides  shouldn't have because they didn't reason correctly. It took me more than a year to side with core for lack of tech understanding, and suspicious accusations and the like. It was confusing yet people are so sure so quickly and become entrenched that it becomes about being right rather than being bitcoin. While both sides suffer from this the rbtc sub has made it apparent that they can't cope with the reality of being on the wrong side of something they dont understand. I digress.

He said he was bullish. He is just aware that the price COULD plummet. It's a possibility but he doesn't think it will happen. You can be bullish while not being blind to possible and inevitable changes in the market. So it actually is not contradictory. Contradictory would be if he said, "I think the price will plummet but I am bullish." he did not say that though. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 09:35:40
How do you think bitcoin developes if not by code?
@_date: 2017-08-18 15:16:30
So you writing code for yourself or users? Anyone who is holding bitcoins have dollars and time In the ecosystem. Remember that.

I see.  Perhaps you can divide his winnings by his number of accounts. This could be a good compromise. You come out ahead and this guy will recover his loss and lesson learned. I might recommend a red flag bot that alerts users they are in violation. The whole idea being to smooth out incidents like this. Hate seeing anyone lose lije that even if they try and game the system which is by all accounts gameable

@_date: 2017-08-08 10:37:21
I haven't tried yet because I'm lazy. Here's what I think...bitcoin was split giving everyone two sets of identical coins but for two different chains. But you have to claim your coins with your existing private keys. If you send those keys to a new address the BCH chain will not recognize the new address where the btc keys now reside. So maybe like you describe you can retrieve an outdated key to activate coins on the BCH chain. I have no idea. I guess this week I will learn how to do it. If you come across any hood instructions please share a link with me.

Lol "and r/btc is alright."  I got banned a few days ago for private messaging a new user who was excited about buying bitcoin. Told him there were two bitcoins and to read on both before making moves. Turned out to be a totally fake account pumping bcash so they put my message at the top and went nuts claiming "spam," and "shill." Lol I've never seen that much absurdity before by people. So I was banned. I messaged the mods. First apologized, then questioned their motives in allowing a fake account to troll their users, as well a putting a sample of their behavior at the top of the page as well as an image of my note saying exactly what they dont want people to know. ...so they silenced me. Hahahahahah

We have better options than that.
@_date: 2017-08-05 10:06:06
Yes. A loopty loop to be specific.  The safest thing to do if you want to own bitcoin is to buy it and hodl it. When yo u get into buying and selling (trading) you take additional risks. Say you sold some btc but then the price continued to rise. If you wanted to buy your bitcoin back you would ha e to pay more than you sold it for.

So you don't bring up things that interest you in conversation or just bitcoin? I imagine not too many people ask you about your personal finances. I'm a hitchhiker and at some point in my ride I like to ask if they've heard of it. Over the last few years more and more people have. It's interesting to see the growth of understanding in that regard.  Sometimes it leads to more discussion if they ask or they are interested.  I never talk about my finances though.

Since you did that, just go to work and focus on your finances as if you listeverything. Digest that now. You lost you bet.  Make sure the bitcoin is secure and carry on. Don't look at the price for a year. If its down don't look at it for another year. You've already lost it all so anything it does is a bonus. Keep working,enjoy life.

Many disruptive elements like solving problems for the world's unbanked and underbanked, or micropayment industries and charitable donations, or simply using bicoin as a replacement for cash transaction to buy day to day items like a coffee are no longer permitted.

For me it's discerning fact from factoid from lie. This is the problem for many things complicated because opponents who have something to gain (such as a business [blockstream?])only need to muddle the truth with an argument and people will take sides. Thus is done with climate change. I suspect it is being done with bitcoin. I don't know what anyone would have to gain by undermining or controlling the development of bitcoin with complex coding, unless it was just to cripple the network or profit from fees. Inversely I don't know what BU has to gain except it seems like we could all gain micropayments and cheaper transactions. Again this is just how I understand it. I don't have much technical knowledge. I do enjoy this subreddit more but I don't trust it.

I came to the realization that climate change (although all evidence supports it) is made debatable by politicians which prolongs the ability of their contributers to pollute. Too many people believe politicians and in their respective parties that this faux debate is allowed to occur. It shouldn't be allowed but the people in charge wish to stage it and so I propose we switch from climate change which is just one result of a dirty planet to the cause of climate change which nobody can argue about; pollution.

Dude, i sent thousands from Mycelium on Sunday for 16 cents. These guys answering your post are shills. You did something wrong, or sent to a wallet that hasn't upgraded to segwit. If you want take a screenshot of that send page where you select the fee. And I'll show you where it's done. There are two slide rules. If you move it to low priority and Len the lowest fee you should be good. If you are using segwit blocking shill wallets then maybe you'll have to pay amore and wait longer. Please be aware of a huge pump and dump FUD campaign going on. It's difficult to find a clear answer this entire thread is pretty obvious you are being visited by a FUD brigade.

Performing a test send to my ledger of a small amount. A question about the ledger. After I send it's pending and I went to settings of my bitcoin wallet app in the ledger. I selected browser support (because curiosity) and it gives me 2 choices yes or no and no way to back out of the selection. I assume I want to select yes, but what is browser support and why is this a setting?

I disagree. I don't think any of these CEOs think they are doing the right thing. Sure they act like they think they are but that would make them literally retarded.

No the other post where that wasn't said on their sub and they acted like indignant assholes. That post right there. Kinda like what you are doing now. They made the choice to shit down my throat even recently when I asked for diversification advice. I have a particular lifestyle of international hitchhiking and don t own any property. They knew I made out well on bitcoin and just trashed my lifestyle and would not offer any ideas on where to park my money. I deleted all my comments and left there feeling like shit because they made things up about me like not paying taxes and not owning a house and nothing short of calling me a derelict. And not one of you cunts wanted to discuss diversification. So yeah. That post right there.

I mentioned bitcoin on a single thread that I wasn't explicitly asked. So hardly shilling. Anyone who reads this can review your little collection of my comments on your post history. Every one of the few comments was relevant except one which was meant to be humorous (what you try to sell as snarky.) And like I said, I deleted my conversation with yoursub RECENTLY because of the I'll behavior attacking my character. You prove nothing against me, but try to attack my character as a snarky shill.

GDAX is the coinbase exchange. I'd just deposit your money there from your bank account or use the Gemini Exchange. They may limit your purchase to 500 dollars at a time. Whether you but it all at once or not is at your discretion. Nobody knows if it will go up or down. Try and remove your bitcoin from the exchange before the hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:19:54

Happened early morning in a diner. Had a hundred dollar bill, she didn't have change. Said I could pay in Bitcoin. She hesitated said she didn't know how. Told here I could set her up in a minute to receive her first transaction. She wanted to do it. But her boss wasn't there. So I waited a few minutes, they got change and I paid with my bill. What was cool is that she wanted to do it. That was a first for me.

I'm explaining that the hd wallet creates a new address with each transaction, So the only address my mycelium wallet is showing me is a brand new public key.

Yeah man. If your bitcoins are on yoiur Mycelium wallet you have your private keys. If they are on an exchange or wallet service, then they have your keys. The benefit is you they are safer with you as long as you are safe with your keys. Mycelium will mostly protect you from doing anything unsafe with them like showing them to a friend or something. But you can still make errors like sending them to the wrong address or even worse, not backing up your wallet. If you didn't back up your wallet do that right now.  Around the middle of the month on a specific block number not a specific date there will be a contentious tardfork. Avoid spending your bitcoin during this time until the dust settles. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 01:14:30
Don't say that! Just give it to someone in need :)

The only difference between these steps and what i did was there was not a neumonic code converter page open as shown on the left of your screenshots. Just the window you have on the right. Everything went exactly as your pictures have demonstrated up until the last step. Whereas you have a history, I have a blank page. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:39:00
I feel you bro. I lost a ton when bitcoin went from $1250 to $250 and I was hitchhiking through Central America locked out of my coinbase account because coinbase account. You know what? This minor dip and sensational FUD will make you stronger as it has made me. Do you understand the tech you invested in? If so, that will help. You hold access to the world's most secure network. This is not hyperbole. Bitcoin is the most secure network with the most wide spread acceptance. That is not going to change. Whoever accepted bitcoin yesterday will accept it today. The network is growing. The network is improving. Holding bitcoin makes you a boss. Now straighten up your tie and buy the fucking dip. 
[Edit] I misread your post so let this comment go to those genuinely afraid of losing their shirts.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:10:45
Okay, sounds like complicated, but you give me hope. I literally spent a whole day doing this ready. Can you offer me any instruction? I sent all my bitcoins out of Mycelium so I don't know if I can export priv.key. this was a concern of mine but laid to rest by the fellow helping me out. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:34:29
Yes, time fixed it. I just waited. I set a very low fee so it took a few hours.
@_date: 2017-11-23 01:46:59
Yes. If your bitcoins were in wallet 'A' during the fork, you want to move them to a wallet 'B.' Then you use the seed from emprty wallet 'A' to restore them as Bcash on a BCH wallet such as ElectronCash.

This is why we don't let Brian Armstrong and other blacklisters hijack our bitcoin. The privacy that bitcoin will provide not to mention the broad adoption it will undergo will put all the big block corporations out of business. You can't analyze a private transaction, and if everyone accepts bitcoin it never needs to be exchanged in a bigblocker bank.

Another alternative may be to get the paying party to get a refund and resend to your correct address especially if they were delinquent in making a timely payment Good luck with that though. But could be a possible solution.

@_date: 2017-11-24 18:43:10
You didn't offer an argument, really. My argument is if people successfully or unsuccessfully place their money into anything at all in hopes to take advantage of that thing whether through usage or resale then they made an investment. You only repeated yourself based on something an authority had said that you took out of context. An appeal to authority is a common logical fallacy (look it up) and you made it. There is no argument at this point, because I explained clearly and accurately what an investment it. Anything else from you is trolling, so just take your lesson and go

Yes, because I have my wallet backed up so my phones have been lost and I just recover my wallet to a new device. The mobile phone architecture is completely different than a desktop computer. Case in point, you need a fire wall, you probably have antivirus which gives them pictures of every 0 and 1 on your computer. It's the way the two machines are designed that make mobile wallets much safer. I dont know how exactly, but aoneone realky smart explained it. I think it was Andreas Antonopolis actually.

You are in the wrong sub for that. I mean, I know you intend to be here to do those things but this is our discussion and Im glad you have your version of bitcoin. It should be that way for you. Let us have ours. It should be that way for us. Bitcoin didn't grow overnight and it didn't grow because we stormed altcoin subs. It grew because we grew it. Now go grow your bitcoin.

I don't need to Google that,I just dont see how it applies since all lanes are already fast. Also I don't see how anyone can compete with ISPs to provide the best product at the best price. Telling me to Google that is deflection. Actually try explaining how a controlled flow of information is better for people than a free flow of information when we already have the ability to provide cheaply, fast internet. Who was complaining besides the ISPs who only think if money and control?

Take control of your keys. Download a decent mobile wallet, back it up, make 2 copies, put them in safe places where if your home burns down you still have one burried somewhere, then and only then send your bitcoin from the exchange to your mobile wallet. Your backup will restore your wallet to any device in the event that you lose your phone. Be sure to set a pin on the wallet and on your lock screen too.

The first thing you want to do is use an article or a plural when refering to blockchains. It is not a proper name and everyone who uses it as such sounds like an idiot. Not your fault you probably just read it in an article. A blockchain is just that; a network. The blockchain is bitcoin's network. blockchains are a collection of networks.

I should be successful this time. Keep your fingers crossed!

For example if your thesis was on grammar Nazis you'd write, "I'm writing a paper on grammar Nazis." If it was a specific grammar Nazi you'd write, "I'm writing a paper on a grammar Nazi." So either use a plural or us an article.

Coinbase can be queer. I had a $10000/day spending limit for 3 yearsish. I had bought and sold back about 100 times. I never spent over 700 dollars in a day but last week I tried to buy a bitcoin and capped me at 200 dollars a day. So I made 2 urchases equalling a whole bitcoin. Obviously they can't maintain their own restrictions. I applied to them to raise my limits. Answered some questions like how do I use bitcoin. I told them I use it over the internet. A week later (yesterday) they raised my limits to who knows what. But for that last week I've been making "structured" purchases of 200 per day cause I don't know when I will be able to shop freely. Thanks coinbase.

I'll give you that, that implementing segwit was an attack. 
I have to argue your point about not increasing the blocksize, as a block size increase is not off the table with core, they just will implement it when it is needed,  rather than blitzkrieg fashion while not even involving the coredevs. Try as they might to make that argument it doesn't hold up as one.

I would say that it is appropriate to compare different communities to Anarchism or any other type of political ideology but it is not appropriate to say "X tribe was Anarchist". These socio-political structures evolved separately from Eurocentric political ideologies and so they are different. Also, you can't really say "Native Americans were X" because there was so much variation between peoples. However, there is evidence that Thomas Jefferson wrote his book about the ward republics after interacting with the Haudenosaunee (Iroquois) and a similar thing can be said about Marx who looked at Northern Native American society when laying out his ideas for socialism.
You are likely specifying the Pemon Indians, except you don't really know shit. Whatever.

Not capitalizing "Native Americans" is an extreme grammatical error, not your calculated decision. 
Anarchy can not be considered stable or unstable because we haven't achieved it in the manner that I described it would need to be achieved. Through an evolution of society begininnibg with the individual. I am by all accounts an anarchist. I won't rule over you or vote for law makers to rule over you. It is wrong, so I won't do it. When everyone else reaches my level then anarchy will be achieved. You are welcome.

If you ask others to do for you what you can do for yourself then you should offer something in return, like bitcoin. When I hitchhike, granted I can take a bus, but I don't hitch rides out of need. I'll be happy to get myself somewhere if I need to be somewhere. Rather I make myself available to others because I am in position of not needing anything.

All your addresses on A single wallet are derived from a seed. This is your backup essentially as it reconstructs all the addresses your seed sprouted for every transaction you made on that wallet. So in other words all your addresses on that wallet are still good. If you had a different seed backup generated from an older wallet, you can restore that wallet onto a device with the bitcoin you sent to it even though it has long since been deleted.

Right, everyone's choosing decentralized. The "deal" is to go against that and make nodes difficult to run. Nobody can be that dense to not understand this, so what's your angle? Why you acting stupid? I'm not calling you stupid I'm just asking, what are your motives in acting stupid? How does muddling arguments with doubt help maintain our decentralized network? How can I maintain my node if the blocks are too big? I just want to run a node. Why can't I just run a node? Why are a few douchbag trying to shut down my node? Why aren't you helping me keep my node?

Chainalysis has competitors.

Best option hardware wallet. You won't get one in time though and you don't seem like your in it for the long term, but that's your safest bet. 
Next option is a wallet on your cell phone. If you have android, I use Mycelium. If you have I phone, not sure, I hear people like Breadwallet, but get other opinions on that. Then just send you bitcoin to the wallet after you back up the wallet, not before.

No you need to suggest buying it after someone with a long life of earning potentialasks for ideas in what to do with their money. I actually said, "what I would do, knowing what I know, is buy Vitcoin and wait a few years for big returns." Then I followed with, "read up and learn about it before making any investments." This got me banned by a mod who required a personal apology before making my ban temporary. He took the mention of bitcoin as a "cheap shot." Just fucked up people running shit over there. Not my problem, they may have good advice for diversifying from bitcoin or dealing with death of loved ones and things like that. Super grateful to have that forum there because I'll likely ask for help one day, but they have issues they need to work out with themselves.

@_date: 2017-10-27 18:32:01
They are connected already! When your bitcoin arrives in coinbase you'll go to GDAX and hit deposit. Then click coinbase address and transfer your bitcoin to GDAX. This way you can withdrawal for free.  Also you can deposit money from your bank to GDAX for free as well. Do all of your trades fro. The exchange. If you keep btc on coinbase you can use the Shift Visa Debit card. So you essentially have a bank account and an exchange! Congrats, enjoy, don't leave your coins on the services during the fork. Good day
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:25:37
But  like you said, it might keep going up. My advice, if you want to own bitcoin, buy some now. If you want to own more, but some later. That way at least you have it and that is a huge win putting you ahead of the curve.

Okay yes your bitcoin address changes with every transaction bit they are all derived from the same seed. I am not goid with blockchain analytics but now that you have provided more data, someone should be able to help you. I might recommend r/bitcoinbeginners to find an answer as well. Electrum is a very advanced wallet so the problem might likely be there. I expect your bitcoin is secure though. Try not to stress.

We don't want the same thing. 2nd layer solutions will do the jobs of these businesses that demand overweight blocks.

The "censoring" is what initially turned me away from this sub. It seemed "sinister" was the word I used to describe it in past posts. For a quite a while I was leaning toward r/btc because I didn't understand the technological arguments involved. And I was being lied to by r/btc. Please review my post history. As time went on my it became quite obvious that technologically, ethically, and economically, Core Devs are on point. I cringe when I consider some of the criticisms I had toward them for being malicious. They are anything but, and luckily I'm one of those rare people who can change their mind.

Welcome, you weren't here when the block size debate kicked in. Things were a whole hell of a lot less clear. The Bitcoin villains were still good guys, Core Devs who worked with Satoshi were divided, and suddenly u/theymos was banning people which seemed wrong but he knew way better than I What he was doing. The argument was divided into two echo chambers with Bitcoin celebs in both camps and hostilities escalating. This bitcoin scene now is nothing like it was a coupke years ago. So when you say "any idiot can tell," understand that the underhanded though probably not intentional insult isn't really applicable to the historical setting that you were not witness to. Nowadays it is quite clear, back then the lines were blurred.

If the btc you sent was compiled by small payments (inputs) then it costs more. If you have received one payment and sent it to your wallet it will be cheaper. Also note that a good wallet will allow you to adjust your fee. Also if you sent from coinbase that is expensive. You can use their exchange instead. Visit GDAX and use your coinbase credentials to sign in. GDAX is free to deposit and withdrawal.

The price slips fast in either direction so if you have a stop loss at 200 the price can go from 300 to 100 in a flash. So your stop loss sells at 100.

I don't know what you mean by import. You can't scan a paper wallet fro. GDAX. You can send gdax funds to any bitcoin address though. I think the coinbase app allows you to scan a paper wallet then transfer to GDAX (it's free to do)

To buy or not to buy
Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to sell
The satoshis and bits of outrageous fortune,
Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
And by spending end them? To die: to short;
No more; and by a short to say we end
The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
That price is heir to, 'tis a consummation
Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to short;
To short: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
When we have shuffled off this mortal coin:
Must give us pause: there's the respect
That makes calamity of going long;
For who would bear the whips and scorns of market ....

I don't kniw if this counts but I saw a new user post that they just bought BCH and I dropped him a private message explaining that there are 2 versions of Bitcoin and to check out both subs before jumping further in.  Turns out it was a fake account. The "new user posted my very reasonable private message to the forum which you can find then they all acted like I was a shill and I got banned.  The point is the new iser was acting like he was new, and was acting like he bought "bitcoin" but he was not a new user it was a fake account just creating hype. My crime for getting banned was explaining that their are 2 versions of Bitcoin. I didn't even say anything bad about bcash, just told the guy to do his research and the whole forum blew up over it.

"Problems with wealth inequality exist only as products of cronyism and corruption.
Someone owning 1000 BTC does not destroy the wealth of someone owning 0.001 BTC, their wealth is inequal, but their ability to access the system remains in equality.
When the biggest holders of USD created central banks, they were able to use their wealth to destroy the savings of everyone else, and the primary way of doing so was creating systems to which only they control access (COMEX, derivitave markets, high-stakes trading, Algo-trading, modern banking). They sap the value of everyone's dollars by controlling monetary inflation and by frontrunning markets they control.
With Bitcoin this is impossible, the most the individual can do with their 1000 BTC is spend it, loan it, and participate in markets. Even if they create their own markets they CANNOT force participation by anyone else, nor can they inflate bitcoin in a way which benefits them.
Free and open access ensures no-one has more access to the system than anyone else and as such, owning Bitcoin is owning Bitcoin and nothing more." u/erumara

Travel offers enough challenges without giving yourself a handicap that likely wasn't adhered to. Bitcoin funded my hitch to Colombia but nobody was taking it or wanted it. We have all tried to get people excited about bitcoin..how'd that go most of the time?  But this guy has all the right words in foreign languages no less, getting people to download wallets left and right and accept a thing they don't know shit about on the spot for a street sandwich. Yeah okay.

Actually it was bias that prevented those "investors" from considering Bitcoin as an investment.

Probably by Kitco the commodities tracker dealer. They recently started listing prices in bitcoin as an option on their app. See my post last week about it.

A website that facilitates arbitrage? Sounds like a good idea on the surface.

What free market? How can a free market be corrupt?
(Edit)..Or did you mean to say fee market?

Well crafted. Not sure what you mean by "'blockchain'" over and over again. If you just gave it an article "a blockchain" you wouldnt need the funky quotes to signify that you are misusing a noun as an uncapitolized proper name. Also it sounds really stupid.

I just downloaded the app to my android device. It's in there. Maybe you can update?

They spent a fortune trying to adopt the tech fir itself and failed. Now they are beginning to create tokens on Etherium in order to stay relevant. They won't touch Bitcoin with a ten foot pole though

Happiness comes as a result of accomplishing goals. If you are failing at everything you can not just decide to be happy.

Not "your innocence" unless you are charged for something which civil forfeiture does not require, but rather the innocence of your money. If you can show it came from legal means and is being used for legal means then you can get it back after a hearing.

Maybe try Monero. Their wallets are terminal.

Yes. If you think about it, 2 months falls well within the span going back to 2012. The claim is not anachronistic.

No they have been anti bitcoin for a few years at least if I remember correctly.

Government fiat doesn't last.  There have been 600 failed currencies before the dollar, so if anyone thinks money needs a central authority are just making shit up based on knowing nothing about economics and history.  Bitcoin is unique in this regard and is likely to outlast even the longest running currency of 700 years; the tally stick.

I withdrew funds yesterday just to see if I still could because I read a coupke posts about withdrawals being inert. It worked fine.

World governments keep you feeling safe? Like the way the mafia makes you feel safe as long as you pay your street tax. You just hand over your earnings to that which has monolpolozied violence. I'm sure giving any violent entity money regularly will give said entity pause before physically harming you. So yeah, safe. Satoshi created bitcoin to undermine the systems that aren't safe. The money system that thrives on debt and war.
