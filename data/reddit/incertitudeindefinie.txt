Do you still have national military service? I assume that like Germany you guys would either do Militärdienst or Zivildienst, right?

I don’t feel like the culture of crass consumerism that we have developed is fueled primarily by people worrying about the value of their money in 10 years. I doubt the vast majority of people have ever even considered this. 
I am highly skeptical of some of the more flowery claims made about sound money. From the way some people talk (notably Ammous) you’d be led to think that fiat money is responsible for everything from WW1 to the abomination of Mark Rothko. I can sort of understand the ideas about war (since you can just devalue and print money to pay for debts), but the idea that modernism, surrealism, and post-modernism in the arts are somehow natural consequences of money being taken off the gold standard is a really quite ridiculous claim (not saying you are saying that - but that is basically one of the statements made by Ammous in his popular book).

Well, it didn’t ‘cause’ WW1. Made it easier to prolong the war. But the causes were legion, none of which had anything to do with currency. 
The whole bit about art is bunk as well. At least with respect to the people who made such ideas passé and cliché (Rothko among them).

Ah ... why did the price jump so dramatically and so quickly? Does that not seem dubious?

Extremely rapid market movements largely not readily explained by other macroeconomic causes are suspect, yes
