The digital currency world is still in its infancy.   Many coins do many things well, but few or none do everything.   As such, you have many different coins competing to be the most widely accepted coin and tons of altcoins getting huge values as people bet they will become the next big thing.   I suspect in 5-10 years times, the world of crypto will contract significantly from the 1000s of coins available now -- many of which will never see any real world usage.

It's a somewhat common term in most financial markets.  The theory is in order to avoid irrational exuberance and bubbles that feed themselves on their own hype, it is 'healthy' to have one or many corrections of 20%+ along the way.

And if Lightning Network goes live and does not work as intended, or fails to gain wide acceptance (like Segwit seems to be stuck at 10-15% usage), then Bitcoin's price vs other cryptos may further erode.  No one knows the future, so diversifying makes sense to a lot of people.

Its funny that 30% growth in a month is a clear sign of the end of bitcoin, a clear sign of a still growing bubble or healthy growth depending on who you talk to.

I mean..the price is the price.  In any othet asset class, an annual gain of 100% is almost unheard of.  For bitcoin, this would mean a year end price of $2k.  If you ignored everything else and nothing else about crypto or bitcoin had fundamentally changed, I think everyone would have been more than happy doubling their money in a year.

It's coming directly from the president's twitter feed.

Trump is badmouthing Ryan on Twitter because he wrote a book in which he said he disagreed with him on some things.  But, your issue is with the adjective the media used to describe this event?  Don't you think if president snowflake didn't get his fee fees hurt so easily, there wouldn't be a conflict to report on at all?

I caveat with "all else equal."  A total crash of the USD will probably accompany a lot of US company failures but, assuming they didnt and kept operating as normal, the price in USD should rise as well.

You consistently see people on this sub tell newbies to move their bitcoin off coinbase and the like.   For your average newbie,  their funds are much safer kept on exchanges.

If the USD approached zero, in theory, the value of a USD denominated stock would massively increase...all else equal.  If i had a gold bar worth $1,000, the gold bars value doesnt go to $0 because the USD goes to zero.  US represents a real piece of the company it represents.

Some people like to give advice with others' money.  My friend told me to sell at 5k, 6k, 8k, 10k, 15k etc (on the way up).  He gloats now about how he told me to sell, but I just tell him, if I sold when you first told me to, I know myself and probably would have bought back in at 10k and would be in a much worse position.

I don't know how those coins are purported to work, but paying a dividend is not the same as generating income.  Ignoring regulations and legal issues, i could sell $100k in stock, do nothing and then make 10 dividend payments worth $10k apiece.

The media gives them a free pass too.  One such bear is Peter Schiff.   Every time i see him in the media,  it always says,  "Peter Schiff,  who predicted the housing bubble and financial crisis,  blah blah blah."  Nevermind that he also predicted gold to go to 5k and that the 2009 market upswing was just a bear market rally.

If bitcoin suffers a sudden death,  it's going to turn many off crypto for a long time.   Who would ever buy into something as a currency or a store of value that disappear so suddenly?  After all,  when bitcoin is gone,  then bch becomes the next target of bad actors.  After losing all my bitcoin money,  I'm certainly not going to be jumping in line to start all over on the next crypto.

Few merchants can afford to keep btc payments in btc at this time IMO.  Inventory must be replenished, bills, rent and salaries must be paid...and most/all of that cannot be done in bitcoin.

Also ignores company margin and pricing strategy.   Without being an industry insider,  I'm pretty sure the margins on most basic fast food burgers are small or break even.   They make up for it with their sides,  drinks and burger toppings (cheese,  bacon etc.)  This was probably not the case in the 70s, therefore,  the price of a basic burger is probably the worst indicator on that menu of actual inflation.

While they tend to rise and fall together, they rise and fall at much different rates, which could make diversification attractive.  If I told you two similar, but different, assets would be +100% and +20% over the next year, but couldn't tell you which would be which, I'd lessen my risk by buying an equal amount of each.

If bitcoin dies, who is going to hop on board the next crypto?  Certainly not the multitudes who lost money on bitcoin.  BCH or whoever is the next top market crypto will face the same (and different)  attacks bitcoin faces now.   No one is going to put money into an asset they have seen can just be replaced in a matter of weeks/ days.   
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:01:35
Right.. in fact you can make the argument that the opposite is true in the financial world.  The higher something goes (bigger it becomes), the harder it is for it to come crashing down...at least in the time period of a human life.  Certainly large companies go bankrupt, but they arent nearly as common as small company bankruptcies. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:07:03
Seems crazy to me that people buy these.  Official inflation is higher than that,  so you are essentially conceding that the best option you have is to lose money over the next 12 months. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:15:57
I certainly understand that.  I don't know if others do.  People here and elsewhere are trying to sell bitcoin/crypto as a currency and/or store of value for the masses.  The masses will always remember the cautionary tale of the first crypto adopters who lost everything in bitcoin because another, similar coin destroyed it.  I'm not saying crypto will cease to exist or anything.  But the overall potential and reach of the entire market will take a serious and significant hit.

Not saying it's legal...you are always required to report all income.    I'm just saying that buying a lot of consumer goods by itself is not likely to trigger an audit. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 13:23:25
Again,  that implies the government is tracking your purchases and taking that against how much you should be purchasing given your income level.   That *might* be true with some of the more public purchases like a house or a car.  But,  buying $20k in electronics on a reported income of $50k isn't going to increase your odds of being audited.  Credit card companies aren't sending your statements to the IRS.
That being said,  if you are audited for whatever reason,  having a bunch of unreported and unexplained deposits into your bank account would get you in trouble for sure. 
@_date: 2017-04-12 03:12:43
I don't think the government is tracking all of your purchases and reconciling them to your income level either ...just sayin'.

In terms of bitcoin replacing the need for the USD and banks, bitcoin doesn't seem as "safe" from a security standpoint.  While it's not as bad as stuffing a bunch of money under the mattress, there are too many stories of (admittedly careless) users losing many bitcoins by getting hacked, having a hard drive crash or go down, or getting their keys lost or stolen.   This just doesnt happen at near the same frequencies at your local bank.  Even if you lose your debit card or credit card, banks don't hold you responsible for unauthorized transactions.    Its not hard to imagine,  as more people hold bitcoin,  that even more will get lost/ stolen and people may lose faith in the system. 
Also, keep in mind, as bitcoin becomes more mainstream and it's more common for people to hold thousands or millions worth of bitcoin in their houses, its not unthinkable that more thiefs will break in and threaten your life if you dont send them your bitcoin.

Kind of strange why everyone is freaking out.  Even if you believe in bitcoin, nothing goes straight up forever.  Even if we get to 100k eventually, there will be many 30, 40, maybe even 60 or 70%+ downturns along the way.

 Anyone who tells you they know with any kind of certainty what the price of an asset will do tomorrow either has insider info, is an idiot, is lying, or is trying to sell you something.

Thing is..if you really believe in the long term viability of bitcoin and believe the true long term value is 100k+, you should really be hoping for short term price declines assuming you are steadily acquiring more. 
@_date: 2017-09-04 16:51:18
Lost coins and coins not being offered for sell at the curreny price are effectively the same as far as the market is concerned.  The only difference is that coins being held will probably eventually be offered once the price hits a certain level or, if they are used and converted to fiat.  Lost coins will never be offered and so will never exact any downward price pressure.

Even with $21m, you could not have bought every single coin...simply because everyone has a price they are willing to sell.  The $1/btc market price just reflects the value of the most recent trade.  Some of the early holders might have sold some of their bitcoin at $1, but you'd quickly buy up that stock and then you'd be buying from people who'd be willing to sell at $2, then $5, etc.  Basically, pumping $21m or even $10m into an asset with a $21m market cap would cause a pretty significant price increase/bubble.

Online gambling is one of the biggest industries using bitcoin right now.   With the ban online gaming bank transactions in the US, almost all of the sites which all allow US customers have some sort of bitcoin deposit option.   Without this,  I probably would have never gotten into crypto.   Now, a large chunk of my bankroll sits in crypto.

 The world economy has always done better in periods of growing population. Imagine asking someone from 1960 to describe a world with 4 billion extra people.

There are tons of ways to lie using valid and accurate statistics.  A simple/obvious example:  93% of people who have ever consumed H2O are deceased. 
A better way to say this is "Your buddy is not an honest statistician.  No honest statistician would say what he is saying."
