Pretty much lmao

Nbd, you just have to wait a bit longer for a return on the investment. This has happened so many times. Unless you put crucial resources into bitcoin, don't sweat it.

Same dude, but I only did $20 so it's whatever. I did make $3k selling 1 BCH from coinbase's shenanigans though. I got really lucky. Fuck coinbase.

In the same boat as you except I convinced my dad to invest but he sold early despite my protests. Don't get the Rolex, it's just an overpriced watch. Reinvest or save if you really want impress. I have no room to talk but it's the most mature thing to do.

Oh, I'm sure, I just want to buy low; I don't mind sitting on it 10 years.

Even if the USD gets a crypto version/medium, it is still tied to a nation. I get what you are saying, but I've already made a couple grand throughout the past 6 years from cryptocurrencies and I'm just some confused kid. I don't expect to make millions at this point, but I'm hoping for a 5-figure return over the next decade.

You think it will continue to dip at the end of the week and by that much?

I've been mostly lucky with cryptocurrency over the years. Mined bitcoin in 2011 with my dual AMD graphics cards I had for gaming at the time (got 0.67 and spent it all years later), mined dogecoin in 2013 and made a couple hundred dollars I think, and bought $200 worth of btc last year and let it sit. My $200 turned into $900 and I got another $500 leftover from my old Circle account. Good shit. Buying a couple grand worth of the dip once the price settles.

Yeah, it seems like the best time to buy was when I was studying for an exam this morning haha.... fucking statistical methods.

O yeah, that's what I'm hoping for, just want to buy at the right time and get the most bang for my buck.
