Hey, sorry for the delay. Thank you for giving us a try, we had some problems that we took care off.
Did you email support for the refund? Most refunds are taken care of in a matter of a few min.

Just a little update. We will be adding Royal Mail in about 4 weeks (Royal Mail is making us wait)
Fedex, DHL and Canada Post will be online before the week is over.
Thank you for all the business that we have received so far as well as all the great support.

Not sure what the .info has to do with the credibility.
If you really think it has anything to do with the cost of a website then you are very much mistaken. The SSL on the website is 10 times as much as any .com domain alone.
Some of the big websites such as Blockchain.info use .info.
Oh and a little side note .info costs more then .com
