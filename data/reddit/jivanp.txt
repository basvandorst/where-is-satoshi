The principle is the same, however; if ~~you don't have~~ _someone else has_ the private keys associated with large sums of money, don't cry about it when that money disappears.
That isn't the issue here, though—the issue was the user incorrectly entering the recipient's address. Even if they did rely on a QR code, they should have checked the result afterwards.

Except someone in this situation is a victim of their own consensual signing of a set of terms and conditions. The exchange is not the one at fault here; the user is.

If you want safety in your investments, why are you putting money into cryptocurrencies rather than traditional stocks?

Why? I fail to see the logic here.


No, it doesn't. This is like saying that if the US dollar fails, all fiat currencies will become unviable.
If any currency in the set of used currencies begins to fail, its users will simply redistribute their assets to other currencies, one of which will necessarily be the most used currency after the fact. As long as there is at least one non-failing currency in existence at any one point in time, that class of currency is viable. This logic holds for all currency classes, including (but not limited to) fiat and crypto.

That's not at all true. The vast majority of fiat currencies are freely traded. USD is simply a *de facto* standard, but there is nothing preventing any given foreign exchange market from using another currency or commodity as its base for exchange. There is not even necessarily a need for any such base; trades can be done simply with reference to the two currencies involved in the trade. It's only since the advent of the modern foreign exchange market that such bases have been used, as it makes recording trades and evaluating currencies easier — but it's not a requirement.
Mathematically speaking, we would say, e.g. that the ratios GBP/USD, EUR/USD, and GBP/EUR are well-defined, and that by the no-arbitrage principle we have GBP/EUR = (GBP/USD) / (EUR/USD). Now suppose that the purchasing power of USD rapidly approaches zero, then GBP/USD and EUR/USD would rapidly approach infinity, but the ratio GBP/EUR still remains well-defined, independently of the existence of USD, due to market factors (namely the market members abandoning USD in favour of any other currency of their choice). The underlying resolution comes from the fact that the value of any currency is a consequence of its perception by the market / utility within the market. That is, if we have a basket of goods with value B, then really, we have B/USD approaching infinity, but B/GBP and B/EUR are still well-defined, whence GBP/EUR = (B/EUR) / (B/GBP), so the USD is not a requirement.
