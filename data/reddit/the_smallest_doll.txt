A crypto handout would really help me... Pm me if you'd like to help out a college crypto investor!

OP said donations work, so I figured I'd ask! What do you mean by affiliate marketing?

I use Kraken, but keep in mind it's a bit of a process to verify to Tier Three, which is the first tier where you're able deposit US currency

Go shove your dick in a wood chipper, bitch.

Looks like a good time to move from California and join my extended family out in Stoke! 
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:04:37
That honestly sounded really convincing, not gonna lie. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:07:01
ARK? 
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:24:28
Beaten like a Mexican piñata and tossed in a wood chipper
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:31:23
Fuck off
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:27:47
The market charts in the background did me in
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:21:05
It's scary to think about. Disheartening too

If you're new to Bitcoin and don't know much, yeah, it could be convincing
Edit: Wording anything in just the right way can sound convincing if you're not careful

Wondered the same thing. I think maybe because it's a private tracker and you have to be invited to create an account? 
@_date: 2018-02-16 00:44:29
I don't. I wish I did. I was making reference to the scammer in the message thread in my other post 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:04:38
They have every episode of every season and there's no other site like it out there! ��
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:09:25
Just make it action packed and exciting. I could get behind this for sure 
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:50:02
I could he wrong, but his other posts seem to say that he's out here for karma. But on the off chance this is real, I hope he's wise enough to hodl!

Okay, Mr. Tai Lopez. I'll be sure to park my 80 lambos next to the 7 new bookshelves I just installed in my garage! 
@_date: 2018-02-04 20:49:22
But I'm more proud of these 7 bookshelves I just installed 
@_date: 2018-03-09 09:12:16
I think we're twins... I thought I was the only one to phonetically sound out an address 
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:09:07
Don't know the full story, but it sounds like a free service that asks for donations. But since that guy was a scammer, they conned him out of $150.
@_date: 2018-02-20 06:37:25
Listing a house, selling it, and clearing escrow in a day, not to mention receiving the pay out from the bank, and buying Bitcoin with it all in one day... Man, an exciting weekend for sure! ��

May God bless him, his posterity, and those who still struggle with his passing 
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:35:04
For real. Idiot! 
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:12:44
Ooh, I misunderstood. For real though, I'd just cut my losses and wait until there were open sign ups for an account ��
@_date: 2018-02-20 07:48:57
Hope it's going well for him 
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:58:55
"How does it feel to be scammed?" 
@_date: 2018-02-15 20:23:56
I'd be happy to scam someone for a few Bitcoin and make a donation to you in support of your book! I'm sure you rely on donations, right? ����

Never heard tax code explained so poetically
