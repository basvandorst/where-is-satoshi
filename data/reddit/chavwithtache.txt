And it'll probably hit it again within 6 months

When you say 'Bitcoin Core is the reference client software implementation of Bitcoin' is that the Bitcoin described by satoshis white paper? If so then your statement is clearly false and the Bitcoin ABC implementation is MUCH closer to that.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:58:05
That already happened some time ago
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:16:58
Seriously though. Not going to be Bitcoin is it..
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:16:21
So.... You are saying that if you were more sensible you would have kept your BCH. 
Fair enough.

Do you not think there is something wrong when the success or failure of a technology as groundbreaking as bitcoin can only succeed if it's network participants (like Coinbase) are forcibly lobbied to implement certain complex features (like segwit) ?
Disruptive technology just gets used because everyone wants to and it just works because it's well designed.
Bitcoin 'jumped the shark' a year ago... Wake up and smell the coffee guys.

Or maybe it's just time to switch your coin...

I thought Bitcoins purpose was to be 'a peer-to-peer electronic cash system' as per the title of satoshis white paper?
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:02:27
Will do. Bitcoin cash is obviously the solution.
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:04:15
Oh so it's for storing wealth. So what it LN for then?
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:02:20
But that photo must be from at least 6 months ago though right? Like when it was still possible to buy stuff with bitcoin without the fees outweighing the purchase price.
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:53:25
He has obviously tried to use bitcoin recently to buy something online
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:11:41
It's a money transfer system which is quicker and cheaper to transact than Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:02:04
Can we firstly clear up something that some people appear to be confused with (not saying this is you but trying to be helpful!). Moving coins from your Coinbase wallet to GDAX and then any 'trading' done on GDAX is NOT going on the blockchain and so you will not get hit with the fees. Moving the coins to your own hardware wallet will - and the current average transaction fee is around $30 if you want it to be processed in a reasonable time - like an hour.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:29:48
Sending ETH from GDAX to Binance still goes onto the blockchain so you will pay the miner fee. Gdax does not charge you any fee for doing it but you will pay a tiny fraction of an ETH to the miners to verify the transaction on the blockchain. BTC currently has significantly higher miner fees because the blocks are not big enough to fit everyone's transactions in so you have to pay more and more (currently over $30) to get included in the block.
This is the same for any address you send to be it another exchange or your ledger nano
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:53:11
Dude, stop drinking the kool aid! Core are hell bent on ruining Bitcoin. You saw that post from a couple days ago when Greg Maxwell was popping Champagne because the fees are so high? Get real guys, those clowns will ruin you.
@_date: 2017-12-28 18:34:16
If that's what litecoin is for, what is bitcoin for?
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:00:06
I don't get it. Are you saying that the sensible fees and transaction times are like a lure but then it's going to crash once you have bought in?
@_date: 2017-12-28 13:08:39
Yeah isn't that what Bitcoin Cash is for?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:53:55
I was replying to your comment where you said 'you should never hold any amount on an exchange' 
So you mean 'you should never hold any amount on an exchange... Unless it's less than say $1,000 in which case you probably should'
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:28:47
Wait, I thought larger block sizes were the devil's work? Core sort a long time and a lot of energy pushing this message. Do you not remember the  movement? Have views changed now? Which way should we think now?
@_date: 2017-12-29 11:23:17
Ok good luck with that
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:31:43
Good job jokes are free
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:49:40
What sort of advice is that?! That might be sensible advice for coins that can actually be moved on the blockchain in a reasonable amount of time and cost - like say Ether or Bitcoin Cash - but with the fees the way they are with Bitcoin, this is practically impossible so the only hope you have of selling if the price were to start going down is to have them on an exchange.
@_date: 2016-06-21 08:05:53
I had the same idea except - rather than fiat - I swapped BTC for ETH (at 0.028) hoping to buy back after the correction.... D'oh
@_date: 2017-08-09 05:28:28
Lol (idiot)
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:21:47
Lol. Good luck with that

Really? They phoned me to ask why I wanted to increase my payment limits. I told them I wanted to send more to coinbase to buy cryptos. They approved it.
