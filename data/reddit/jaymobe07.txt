Yup.  I'd be hella depressed.  I mined eth/zec and traded with that.  I'm still more than doubled my roi but it would be hella nicer when btc was at $15k or more.   I'm just bummed I don't have more cash to buy in.  Was looking to cash out this spring to help buy house/car.  Car might be on hold.  My account are all about 33% savings, crypto, stocks
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:28:17
Down on crypto and stocks today.  Damn lol.  Went from $20k to 15k.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:54:48
I'll admit this sucks.  But at same time I'm alright.  I've got the amount I have from mining over the summer so this isn't as bad of a pill to swallow.  Feel bad for those that put a lot of money in it hoping for short term profits
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:58:47
If anything the fans give out sooner.  My cards run 55c at less than 60% fan and only 60-70% power.    My hybrid 980ti runs up to 60c and is over clocked at max voltage since release.  Which die/vrm is going to give out sooner?  Also the 980ti uses more than half the power of my 6 1070s lol. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:35:14
I'm mainly hoping some eth/zec miners get scared and leave so the difficulty goes down.  
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:52:01
It sucks.  But I got mine through mining so eh.  Still more than doubled my investment.  Makes me think about selling my gpus though with recent spike in prices. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:48:42
Not me.  And honestly I only got in on it because I started mining Ethereum.  Then I switched to zcash once that became more profitable.  I just wish I was switching them to Bitcoin a lot sooner.  I knew about crypto back then.  Even tried to set up a wallet and was going to mine using 2 6850s.  
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:44:15
High fees.  And took them a month to answer a support ticket I put in.  
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:55:54
They are not an exchange.  You won't be able to send/receive.  Just buy/sell
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:24:17
Why?  I hold btc.  Made money from btc.  Can we not talk about the fees?
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:42:34
Well theyll both be a pound.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:01:36
No, that's the the saying to put it in her pooper when aunt Flo is in town for the week.  
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:05:03
I'm considering.  Mining zec since June.  $10.5k.  Wish I would have just bought coin though lol
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:47:20
What about Ethereum and litecoin?  Don't they have large volume?
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:54:32
You are selling to a buyer, not coinbase.  So as long as there are fiat buyers youll be able to sell up to whatever limit coinbase has if they have one
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:58:24
I put sell orders on my stocks hoping someone fat fingers lol.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:57:28
Actually hit 12,800 on gdax
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:36:13
Use an exchange like kraken and you'll be fine with the gdax fees lol.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:58:15
I haven't had issues turning my crypto into fiat.  I've turned ltc and eth into usd no problem($1.5k worth).   Haven't sold my btc.  This is coinbase/gdax.  I think people are having issues with large amounts as many exchanges have limits.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:04:41
It probably will unless it's some outrageous amount.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:40:19
Or peeps selling before end of year?  It's all crypto.  Not just btc or a few 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:44:54
Or crashes tomorrow.  No one knows
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:48:57
Sell an amount equal to your initial investment and withdraw to bank account.  You do not tax until you have realized gains. This at least goes for stocks.  
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:05:45
.....that makes me sad.  
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:50:27
No.  You just locked in gains.  No one knows when this is going to stop
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:30:54
Triple digits? Lmao sell some and get a really nice hooker
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:54:26
....so you'll be fucked?  Lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:34:16
I've earned mine from mining and I still sweat even though I haven't removed anything more than hardware cost lol
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:41:57
Not in the units that count.  Freedom units
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:35:54
If I had enough to buy a house I would do the same thing.  Roof over my head and no mortgage/rent is a nice thing.  Though I'm only doing this to help buy a gen 2 viper gts
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:59:58
There's a lot if illegal dealers out there using crypto now...
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:56:18
100,000 in a week.  Good luck with that
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:06:37
That's what I don't get.  How would they know when the exchanges don't give the IRS that info yet.  Or am I missing something
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:38:19
Need to solve the tx fee and long transfer times though
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:36:50
Ive got it from mining zec.  I'm still depressed lol
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:45:46
Sell for usd on an exchange.  Depending on amount you have there is Bitcoin ATMs also
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:09:10
Sell for usd and buy bch.  Isn't that hard
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:35:12
Buy back within a month.  Wash 
@_date: 2016-01-22 19:33:55
Same here.  I was still in highschool.  It was around like a dollar.  Thought the idea of btc was a joke.  Now I'm here wondering how to get in it and if its to late 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:44:25
Source?  Because I've traded and transferred back to coinbase no problem.  Only fees I've seen is when buying/selling on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-11 00:30:59
This is coinbase.  Not coinsquare.  Or am I missing something
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:51:51
If you're set on alt coins, do ltc and eth, maybe xrp since it's so cheap.  I remember Dubaicoin.  Shit pumped to $50 and look where it is now.  I'm in zec but that's because I mine it.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:29:59
Didn't even know Amazon was around then
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:07:55
I had no issue setting up my account.  Sure you didn't miss something?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:11:30
Use gdax.  Set limit orders.  Do not use the coinbase page/app to buy/sell.  But yes, the fees on coinbase are dumb
@_date: 2017-11-06 16:39:48
Over time since a lot of exchanges have limits.  They probably charge higher fee to do larger amounts
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:29:28
The Bitcoin you receive should be the amount agreed to when you initiated the buy.  Not when it clears. You just can't do anything with it until it clears which can suck if there is a huge drop
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:54:01
You should set larger goals for yourself
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:47:19
I work retail.  I don't care if people use cash.  Checks are what is annoying.  Especially when they get pissy because they want to return the item for cash the next day.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:39:15
I keep poking ltc but it won't do anything!!
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:44:25
I'd happily take gold for stuff I sell.  Just very few people actually have gold. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:10:45
I have ripple to. Not much but just in case it starts to sky rocket
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:27:00
Isnt that fork going to raise the difficulty?  Don't really follow bch.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:57:19
No one is switching to 2x.  Just like bch and btg
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:04:18
Coinbase.com.  Easy to use.  
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:58:49
Locks in at the time you buy so if it goes down by time it clears youre sol
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:58:20
Coinbase.  No point in paying a moving fee when they are supporting it.  Though trading will be blocked for a little bit after the fork.  
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:26:04
I had about $300 of zec on kraken I changed to bch yesterday when it was $900.  Sold back to btc when bch was $2200.  Wish I did it with all of my btc at the time.  Oh well.  Kraken sucks though when there is a lot of traffic.  
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:01:21
Your fiat currency isn't backed by anything and people accept that everywhere
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:09:02
Yes.  Coinbase has fees and they'll show you before you send to gemini
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:54:11
@_date: 2018-03-10 17:44:38
How is it any different than other alts?
@_date: 2018-03-08 18:50:09
Wtf is tether and how is it needed to cash out?  I hit sell and transfer to bank account
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:07:34
It's stressing me out and I earned everything through mining.  My miner is paid off.  I'd much rather my account say 10k several weeks ago instead of 7k now.  
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:00:49
This is a bad idea depending on exchange/location because of possible tax consequences
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:11:22
I guess I technically did some when I switched zec to btc
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:15:09
And then at the 10k, then 9k, then 8500, now 8k.
@_date: 2018-02-04 23:58:19
Just like no one here has proof it will go up
@_date: 2018-03-27 03:24:27
2 months ago?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:10:17
And they probably think that makes them safe from returns lol
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:05:01
they werent going to in the first place.  They did this so their share holders could make a quick buck.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:06:37
at the time, everyone thought it would go up.  Just like now, everyone keeps saying its the bottom.  No one knows.
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:30:16
I sold before reading this.  But i bet it will go up now.  Just took way to big of a hit this past week.  Between crypto and stocks.  Man.  Luckily my crypto profit has helped my stock "losses."  
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:05:16
im down to about 50% return.  Seriously about to jump out, sell my hardware for almost 40% profit.
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:31:46
How many you buy?
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:33:36
They're mining zec.  Not Bitcoin.  Depending on the gpu(1070), maybe even Ethereum
@_date: 2018-02-17 18:36:00
Could have kept going down.  You don't know when the bottom or top will be.  If anyone claims they do, they're lying
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:40:34
Same with it going back up
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:25:21
Should I put my current coin in a different account to make sure I get the free ones?  Currently all my Bitcoin is on coinbase.  Sold my Ethereum and litecoin to buy btc.   Only about .4 btc
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:44:46
You think it will reach $250k? Lol
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:26:49
I'd be trying to recover any fucking data off that hdd
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:40:51
I'll bet my current coins that it won't reach $250k.  
@_date: 2017-10-21 01:29:32
Wish I bought in the last dip at $2000
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:58:05
A fork/split that happened few months ago. If you had btc, you received bch(Bitcoin cash).  Not worth as much as Bitcoin but still ~$2500.  Kraken accepts bch.  Not sure of other exchanges
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:19:15
...it's been going down for a month. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 17:28:56
What about those that sold and got in at a lower price?
@_date: 2017-10-18 20:15:33
Screen it and message me if it happens.  If Reddit is even around then
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:05:57
i wanted a 2nd gen viper.  Was hoping this spring, but not now with this crash and stocks taking a shit lol.
@_date: 2018-04-13 00:39:29
Lmao i swear.  So i moved my cash to my bank.  And it goes up lol.
