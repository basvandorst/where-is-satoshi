Get in line. No one can make sense of the situation. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:27:59
What is that even trying saying. Who are they protecting by stopping transactions; why are they doing it; how does the leaked document influence their decision. So confuse.

As in most large problems both parties share some level of fault. The difference though between a corporation and a person is a corporation mindlessly acts to increase profits a person is a complicated mess of emotional wants and needs all kind of blending into each other. I just don't think it serves us well to handle the situation so heavy handedly. 
We need to be responding in unison with compassion to those who are already hurt and working towards continuing to raise awareness of the risks of exchange and encouraging the community to move their money out into wallets.
I think that would create a better long tail of value for the community and thus bitcoin.

I have no money in gox but I hate the blame the victim meme on this subreddit. 
While you are technically correct you completely lack understanding that obviously there is sizable group of people who lost money and have been hurt by this. Your comment and those like it do not help those who have lost and prevents the community from moving forward.

When I was working the Human genome and protein sequencing it took a few hours to reimport the dataset into MySQL. The size and complexity was probably on par to the blockchain. That time frame was if you disable constraints during the import. If you left those on to say find a a collision half way through it could take you about a day.

I think they just said they are disappearing. If there is a security threat then moving offices won't help that unless they are just making that a mailing address and disappearing. Bad times for anyone who is hoping to get their money back.
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:40:11
But how is moving to another published address going to help them? Unless what they are really saying is thats now our mailbox we have no public address.
@_date: 2014-02-20 15:44:34
I think they are incompetent and scared. Pure speculation but I imagine its not just nerds in basements who are going to be out money but people with shall we say more influence? And those kinds of people don't take kindly to being stolen from. Bitcoin attracts all types.
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:57:56
 well atleast no ones sent anything.
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:17:55
The title to this submission is pretty bad which is why it's getting downvoted. But man that was a great read. It's exactly the kind of message I'd hope from the community and it's the only path forward to repairing this damage. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 16:15:11


that was in the protestor feed.
@_date: 2013-02-15 17:38:01
easy after 3-4 days.

Agreed. [Just a sad charlie brown walk to 20](

There should be an [asm.js]( compiled miner running on bitcoinity. I would mine for him while watching the graphs.
@_date: 2013-05-10 04:39:54
Haha I like those cards! No I hear you. When I do another postcard push I'm going to have multiple options and much fancier cards. Not everyone is a fan of minimalism. 
Thanks for the link 0.03 seems high for that service. My heavy card stock post cards were .20c plus .33c for us postage he's making a big profit on each card (assuming his costs were on par with mine)
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:30:02
Good point! I'll have to order some :) It might be a rolling thing like once a month I show up with a box of postcards and a bitcoin address. Next time i'll have my wife pick out the cards 
@_date: 2013-02-15 20:38:50
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to offend anyone. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 13:48:42
oh my. thank you for pointing that out!
Edit: WOAH! Reddit gold! Thank you whoever that was. You rock!

Is anyone able to translate this enough to know why the bank closed their account?
@_date: 2013-04-18 10:34:45
Perfect. Thank you.

I just went through this. 
1. Sign up for mtgox
2. Do bitinstant to mtgox the account number is the all digit it. 
Do alittle extra cause they gonna take some
3. Go to Walmart if you can it's easiest there. Full out the blue form for moneygram
4. In ur mtgox acct will appear usd not bitcoins. Use the use to buy bit coins at market (checkbox on buy form)
5. Go to add funds then there is a tab to withdraw funds. Pick bitcoins and put in you bitcoin address
Sorry if this looks weird trying to reply on mobile

Woah you guys are actually listening! Thats awesome. CSS issues exist on every site especially if you start shrinking your browser window. You will figure it out I am sure.
On a small personal note. You got to work on that logo. I am sure right now you are working on just fulfilling orders and trying to stay afloat as a startup. I get it. BUT a drawn squirrel giving the thumbs up does not inspire confidence that you guys are legit. Squirrel's are fine but think about presenting him in a different way. Just doing a quick google search cause I am not a brand guy. [Look at these 50 "inspiration" logos]( The animal logos all look very modern and professional. Even the [pink godzilla]( logo is great. If pink godzilla made a text editor for mac, I would buy that text editor. So think about that in the background as a lower priority thing.

Dude. Do it. You and I both know that you would have the coolest food truck of them all!
@_date: 2013-05-10 20:09:51
You know what I want? Something like [Store Envy]( a customizable storefront thats hosted by someone else. I would pay a monthly fee/percent cut for something like that. As soon as you tell someone they need to go setup a heroku account your cutting out alot of small sellers who make some really neat stuff!

[erotic webshop...](
@_date: 2013-05-09 15:27:50
You're right. If people show interest in the idea I'll build out a more robust system for processing the payments.
Edit: Swtiched to coinbase!

Software engineer here. Some quick thoughts
1. You're using bootstrap.js. Awesome! I wish more bitcoins websites would use it. A lot of bitcoin websites out there look like they are from the 90s. I am looking at you bitmit. This will give you a great foundation to make beautiful websites that work well on all devices.
2. You are using the responsive setup for bootstrap but your website isn't very responsive right now. I highly recommend the [Responsive Design Bookmarklet]( It will allow you to see what your website looks like at various resolutions. Using that you can see that even at the biggest resolution of ipad sized your logo is overlapping your email input box. [At iphone sized screens things just go insane](
Good luck!

Except I'm not a merchant. Just a software developer with a box of postcards and I thought I might try something kinda fun. If it doesn't work out its okay I still have alot of [really pretty postcards](

Just some back of the napkin calculations. My cpu is a Core i5 2500K not the top of the line intel machine but a good one none the less. According to the [mining hardware comparison]( that has a mhash rate of 20. Lets assume that our little js miner took 100% of a single core. I have 4 cores so lets bring that number down to 5. Finally asm.js is currently about half the speed of native code on the firefox nightlys so we need to half that number to 2.5. **That means each user visiting the site with comparable hardware would be generate 2.5mhash/s. There were 9000 people sitting there watching the charts this morning (it says the number at the bottom) That brings in bitcoinity's total pooled hash rate to 22500 mhash/s.**
The biggest mhash/s number on the wiki for a single card is the 7990 coming in at 1200 mhash/s. Which is easily matched if only 480 people were watching the charts.

You hit the nail on the head. Whats neat about this is that it wouldn't really be possible to do the same thing with a credit card processor at least not at the price point I am selling the service at. Bitcoin is uniquely positioned for small transactions. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 13:37:14
Thanks. Good to know. I don't plan on following this method further than these 100 (though there hasn't been any takers :( ) If it had been a successful little experiment I would have built out a little service using something like bitpay. On a side note to mix things up to see if anyone at all is interested in something like this I am [now taking international addresses.](
@_date: 2013-04-13 02:36:50
I watched that for way too long.
@_date: 2013-05-15 20:08:29
Can that be used as a dwolla replacement? (assuming an exchange supported it)
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:54:43
1.) Don't day trade on a mobile device. (But the market is falling I need to sell quick to minimize my loss!) STFU Me-from-this-weekend, you don't have your full set of information in front of you. Wait till you get home.
2.) Never ever ever leave your day trade money in bitcoins. If you are not at your desk cash out. You can't react quick enough while out to make the risk worth it.
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:30:55
If that were true than no one would put money in retirement accounts backed by stocks. Its a matter of size of the risk vs gains. I think 5 years is too long to hold. Maybe over one year might make more sense.
@_date: 2013-05-16 18:09:30
Cool :D
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:24:30
Agreed. I wouldn't buy coins from them but from the merchant side it was like 3 clicks to get a order form.
@_date: 2013-04-30 05:40:27


Maybe we should do a big charity push. A bunch of btc users pooling their funds to make a 10000+ donation to save babies or cure cancer might get the medias attention long enough to drive the price up.  
@_date: 2013-04-16 03:56:11
I'm sorry man. I know it hurts and there is nothing I can say to make that hurt less.
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:49:33
Done, So sorry! I may expand outside the US but with the first batch I am just trying to keep it simple.
@_date: 2013-04-28 19:17:22
That's comforting. 
@_date: 2013-02-16 18:38:06
Oh okay thank you
@_date: 2013-05-09 17:12:17
Nope. But definitely influenced my decision to switch sooner rather than later. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:19:31
I think the best solution is default on but with a very easy very visible turn off button. I dont think most users would care about 2-3$ on their power bill but I totally think it should be the users choice.

Wtf is going on with blockchain lately?
