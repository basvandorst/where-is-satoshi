It's just a public key that wasn't produced from a private key (verification key).  Make up any public address (e.g wallet) that follows the spec and you have a bitcoin eating address.  Private keys are impossible to derive from the public key (this is not true in reverse), which is the cornerstone of cryptography and bitcoin's security.  The veracity of transactions is a whole nutha level and has to do with all that mining and shit but that's more than you need to know.

I don't really get the Apple hate.  Yes, they are blocking apps.  But that only suppresses bitcoin adoption with the most diehard Apple users, and those are the **last** people who will use bitcoins.  
Bitcoins don't have big cute buttons to check your email or go on Facebook.   Apple users don't use computers for anything else. Maybe, *maybe* they might use bitcoins if they work for a movie studio studio and a rich Hollywood friend told them about it, or if they are a graphic designer with software developer friends that they trust.  Online wallets *do* work in Safari.  So there's that.

OK, finally made me understand dogecoin.  The community, and the massive numbers all make sense now.  I was watching the price just drop and drop and couldn't understand why it hadn't taken the wind out the doge community's sails.  
**But** if that's true, isn't it also true that the bitcoin's high price is a key ingredient?  Dogecoin has no barrier of entry.  That's also a key ingredient.  But isn't it bitcoin's price that makes it *desirable*?  
However, no one seems to want *hear* this (here come the downvotes):  I'd recommend mining it, discussing it, etc., but it's *never* going to have a high coin worth simply because it has a community.  It's very basic economics.  What's going to happen when people realize that the price will never rise (because there's an endless supply)?  I just wish the community made it more clear to the people coming in that the dogecoin network is a "learning" cryptocurrency but will not ever parallel bitcoin's rise in price.  Otherwise it comes off as intellectually dishonest.

The problem is actually worse than everyone thinks.  Ready to be scared...
CoinBase uses them to arbitrage.  I base this on public statements CoinBase has made insofar that they would sell litecoins once Mt Gox added it.  I thought that was strange at the time because their btc price is essentially pegged to BitStamp.
Then I realized they buy from bitstamp (and perhaps BTC-E if cheaper) but they SELL on Mt Gox.   And, yes, you guessed it, they just need a Japanese holding company to move the fiat.
Ok, so what happened?  Overstock, TigerDirect and other CoinBase vendors happened.  These vendors are applying major pressure to receive fiat for their btc.  This in turn requires CoinBase to push their fiat through Mt Gox which clearly didn't escrow incoming fiat.  Left to choose between the run on their funds from clients and supporting CoinBase, who is depending on them to supply their merchants with fiat, they are choosing CoinBase.  Of course this institutional level malfeasance will collapse and Mt Gox will become a very big story some day soon.  The scary part is that it might cripple CoinBase in it's wake.
Tldr; Mt Gox is screwing everyone over and they will potentially cripple CoinBase.

I'm a "real" web developer.  I've worked on large projects for American Express and then started my own company 15 years ago and do over 600K in billables with multiple developers year after year.
No offense to OP but this isn't necessarily a stunt and there's several logical reasons for it.  It's not common but if you need to whip up a critical announcement and you don't want it on your normal template and you don't know who's going to end up pushing it out, this *exactly* how it might go.  For example, if a large exchange was crashing the price of a commodity and a new entity was handed over the site and needed to stop the bleeding by announcing they are stepping in. 
Now, it certainly *could* be a stunt.  But it's just speculation on OP's part and his confidence is not justified.  I for one don't see why Karpeles would shut down the rest of the site if he was trying to calm the masses with the supposed *stunt*.

Do you just cut-and-paste that statement when read something you don't like?  Are you a bot?
The only conjecture on my part is that CoinBase sells on Mt Gox.  I base that on their statement about accepting LiteCoin when Mt Gox does.  I clearly said that I'm *basing* this on a statement they made.  
So I stated a bunch of fact:
(1) CoinBase *did* say that they would exchange LiteCoins if Mt Gox did.
(2) Overstock and TigerDirect use CoinBase for their merchant services and BTC sales *are* converted to fiat through CoinBase.  
(3) Mt Gox *isn't* releasing fiat to almost all retail traders using their site.
If you don't think CoinBase sells through Mt Gox, fine.   I have my circumstantial evidence. *You*, on the other hand, have *nothing* to counter it, besides accusing me of wearing a tinfoil hat.  
The only other part that is not necessarily a proven fact is that Mt Gox is no longer solvent, but there's a ton of evidence there (just follow the OP's links).   If you still think Mt Gox is solvent, then you're the one wearing the tinfoil hat.

Ok, I'm going to try to answer myself (having researched the Cornell paper now).   So basically a pool (e.g. ghash) could keep their found blocks "secret" for a while and then sort of jump out from behind a bush after they generated a few blocks and say "surprise", claiming the longest chain.
This the part where the logic starts to get confusing for me.  The purpose of this "selfish mining" would be to waste others' resources.  So if, say, they mined 10 blocks "in secret", and "claimed" that segment of the chain after revealing the blocks, the rest of the bitcoin network *will have* wasted their hashing power *during those 10 blocks*.  The reason I'm italicizing "will have" is because that is where the reasoning is confusing for me.  So theoretically ghash can make other miners waste their resources?  Funny pranksters then?  Should we put them on an episode of punk'd?  Call them counter-culture?  My point is how does this equate to them getting more bitcoins?  All they are doing is annoying other miners, but they would have gotten these blocks *anyway*.  It's like if I won a bet among my friends but pretended they were still in the running only to reveal that they weren't later on, but they still lost the bet either way.

I'm still holding bitcoins so let's hope not :)  If Gox falls and even if CoinBase gets crippled or falls, there will be others to replace them. 
And honestly these problems sometimes need to occur so regulators have a framework to use.

Tell that to all the companies that had to shut down or hand over anonymous information to the NSA.  If the government wants Coinbase shut down, it will just regulate the shit out of it.
I don't think that will happen.  I think we will find a happy medium.  It's just that a representative voice for the bitcoin community will help define that happy medium.
Think of it from the government point of view (I know that's hard but think of it as "know thy enemy" if you want).  They can't tax outgoing transactions.  They can't tax transfers.   Sure, they can follow the blockchain to prosecute criminal transactions more easily than cash (even though a smart criminal will bounce the fuck out of coin across dozens of wallets).  What they can tax is merchants and sites like Coinbase.  Merchants can just charge tax in bitcoins, and Coinbase will start requiring identifying information and will have to send you profit and loss tax statements, which in a way will be a good thing when the price stabilizes because you will benefit if the price goes down.   That's why I really believe that's when we'll start seeing the true ceiling.  I think it will keep climbing through 2014 and finally get regulated by 2014/2015 but will be $2000-3000/BTC by then.  Then the price will sink 20-25% and stabilize there.

@_date: 2013-11-28 15:22:29
First let me say I might have these calculations wrong. I would love it if anybody would correct me if I do.  Second I'm not factoring in difficulty increases or decreases nor the pricing increases or decreases.  But since I'm not doing it with bitcoin or litecoin I figured it's okay for an apples to apples comparison.
You can spend $1000 on a card that will get you 1 mh/s.  Litecoins current total network cash is around 45,000 Mh/s.  So you can have 1/45000 of the network which equals 0.000022222222222%.  So that's the chances of getting the next block as a solo miner.  So what's your expected return for 2 weeks?  Well there are 8064 blocks created every 2 weeks so the amount of blocks you will statically get is 1-((1-%network)^8064).  You can replace 8064 with any range.   That 16.5%.   25 litecoins at $45 = $1125.  So very roughly speaking your expected return is $186 every two weeks.   
Now with bitcoins you can use the same logic and I calculated the rate of return to be a little bit lower than what my friend was earning with the BTC guild.  But I can tell you that a 10.7 GH/s ASIC blade gets you about 0.01 btc per day with BTC guild (my solo mining calc was about 20% lower).  For $1000 you can get about 2.5 of those so apples to apples you can expect about .025 per day which gets you $350 every 2 weeks.
Edit: bitcoin difficulty has gone up but there's no ASIC chips for litecoins.  You can spend $50 and get 333 mh/s for bitcoins.  You need to spend $1000 to get 1 mh/s with litecoins.

I spent a long time researching cold storage. The best AND easiest solution IMO: Paper wallet from bitaddress.org with the BIP0038 checkbox and a password entered.  
The trickiest part for me was getting the coins off of the paper wallet.  Of course I was testing with a small amount.  For this I recommend scanning your private key (who wants to type all that) and using an online blockchain.info wallet.  Under the import tab, you can just paste your private key into the box and click Add Private Key.  
At this point, you'll be prompted for the password that you entered when you created the paper wallet.
You can use any QR reader from your phone to scan the private key from your piece of paper and since you'll only being doing this when you want to spend the coins, don't stress about the idea that your phone or computer is exposed at this point.  Just copy and paste the private key that your phone's QR scanner read, and email it to your computer.   From there just paste it into your online wallet on blockchain.info.   If you have any change (for example, your paper wallet had 3 bitcoins, but you only needed to get .5 to your online wallet for spending) you should send the difference to another paper wallet.
FWIW when I tried to scan the private key with blockchain's android app to get it into a wallet, it errored out.  I assume because of the BIP0038 protection.  However, on my computer, blockchain.info website was able to import the paper wallet flawlessly using my above method.  Also, the blockchain iPhone app doesn't let you scan in private keys at all (you can scan a public wallet address for sending only).

For a random downvoted post that I happened to come across browsing I have to say I like that answer.
@_date: 2013-11-20 02:42:09
First, don't buy from that link below. 
Bitcoins can be broken down to as little as 0.00000001 parts. 
Coinbase is the best place in the US, and I think the minimum is $10.00.   You need to hook up your bank account to them, but they are generally safe.  However, they are currently out of bitcoin inventory but they will get more soon.  You can also use localbitcoins.com which is sort of an ebay for local bitcoin sellers who will physically meet you to do the exchange.  Just be sure to pick only a trusted seller, and keep in mind that the price on there will be a little higher than Coinbase usually.  
As for the wallet stuff:  I would recommend doing some more reading.  The short answer is that a wallet on an online site is only as safe as the site, so you need to be careful, but now that bitcoin is more mainstream, there are sites you can pretty much trust, like blockchain.info and coinbase.com.   You can also make a wallet on your computer or phone (as you did).  And you can make as many as you want for free.  There is different software to accomplish this and you can just google or read Reddit and choose between the top ones.  However, you run the risk of your computer getting hacked.
If you want to keep your wallet completely off-line, there is something called a paper wallet, but that's usually not the first step and it becomes more necessary if you have a lot of bitcoins (e.g. if there's enough where it becomes the type of thing you want to store in a safety deposit box).  
I hope that helps.

Just remember that bitcoins started that way.  There were no merchants at first.  Granted, litecoins is *purely* speculative at this point.  But so what?  There is a theoretical add value with the lighter transactions and history is rife with examples of the newcomer out competiting the original.  With the network effect it would be an uphill battle but just keep in mind, that digital currency is never going away.  It's just a matter of the breadth of its usage.  The world owes nothing to bitcoins.  If something makes it unattractive, another digital currency can step up and claim it's piece of the pie.

Exactly my take.  I have a feeling it won't block you from putting BTC in and out, and they shouldn't.  Plus, they shouldn't give you a wallet address if that's their policy.   I mean if they won't allow you to "use" the wallet they shouldn't allow you to send to it.

I want to start putting my bitcoins in "cold storage".  I'm most comfortable on Windows.   
Would this work:  
* I create a wallet on multibit
* I export the key
* I store the *.key file on 2 USB drives I put in 2 safes
* I uninstall multibit.
If I need to use the BTC in the future.  
* I install multibit anywhere I want.
* I get the USB drive and import the key.

But just like the "soon" meme, I'm waiting for the real growth to start and then they will get an innocent email from me that almost seems like I'm bringing it up for the first time.

Anyone who understands bitcoin immediately bristles at the stupidity of picking some funny number out of thin air like a 15B market cap.
*Huh, what?*  
It doesn't fit with any paradigm out there.  Either this gets critical-mass of mom-and-pop level businesses like credit cards did (my guess is 10 trillion + market cap if that happens), or it becomes the main system for large transactions or maybe just large overseas transactions (my guess would be 100B - 1T if that happens) or it's traction completely stalls (and I don't see how that will happen but just for arguments sake...) and the "potential" multiplier of the valuation goes away and it drops back down to the $200s or so.    
Now you can argue and debate that and I have fun doing it.  But this is an analyst who is supposed to be trusted by his clients for his expertise.  In my opinion, it's wrong to pretend there is some easy-to-calculate *long-term* valuation.   Could it stabilize at $1300? Sure.   But it's a really complex picture involving economics, sociological aspects, government, media, and changing counter-balances of the fiat currency world.   
Arrogance, stupidity, or some other type of bullshit is afoot.

What I'm seeing this week, is that the friends who were laughing at me, are now taking the attitude of "I should buy some just in case" and I'm answering basic questions about how to purchase them.  I feel there is going to be A LOT of those people hitting the market going forward.   That's why I think it has the potential to go way up.

True, but it gets tiring arguing the basics when we could be having debate on the more nuanced issues.  Is bitcoins cash, is it currency, is it hedge like gold?  Is it all 3?  Will there be a deflationary spiral, will the network effect pass the test of time when there's only money to be made with transactions?  It's frustrating to explain the basics to those who hinge their argument by explaining why it "isn't" a fiat currency.  They're missing the point.  
Some people just don't get math.  They don't understand that it can't die.  There's nothing "to kill".  It's the emotions of their cognitive dissonance that gets tiring after you've experienced it being thrown in your face over and over.
@_date: 2013-12-31 16:18:55
Here's what's likely that happened:
Generally, you want to have a bit flag on records that you don't want to ever be permanently deleted from your database (for reasons like regulatory compliance, follow-up support with customers, responding to a court order, or even just guarding against a bug wiping out data).   So the field could be blActive and it's set to True by default, but once an account is deleted, the system sets it to false.  In addition, you could also garble the username and password and wipe out other system id's to protect against other authentication vectors.  
The problem is you have to design for that from the beginning.  My guess is that the account deletion process went from a manually-handled one to an automated one (when their customer base grew too large to handle manually) and all the authentication procedures weren't checking against any sort of bit flag, because it wasn't originally developed with them.  To add that after the fact would be difficult because of the multitude of dependencies in the code.  So, they came up with this quick and dirty solution.  But, oh my, does it suck.  
I think CoinBase in general is so "pretty" looking that my guess is they existed of strong UI guys with marketing experience, and very little in the way of heavy-duty back-end guys (or potentially 1 or 2 very experienced in a narrow technological expertise like payment processing web services).   Their heavy duty DBA(s) came later or, god forbid, are not there at all.

My concern about a digital currency landscape that has only bitcoin:  as soon as the coin runs out and the blocks are only worth their transaction fees, you'll see competition in the market.  If you are truly a digital currency advocate (and not a speculator) it's pretty fucked up to think you DON'T think a competiting network is a good idea.

For sure, you can keep it in the online wallet after you sweep it in there.  It's just a preference thing.  If you are the type of person that created a paper wallet in the first place, then you will generally want to put it back when you are done with it.  But it's very quick.  Just print out another paper wallet from bitaddress.org (with the same BIP0038 password if you want) and send the remaining balance there.
I have friends with only online wallets and I think that's ok with reputable sites for some coins.  I also use Multibit for spending cash.  Multibit is a very easy all-in-one bitcoin wallet software for your computer.  So in your scenario, *that's* what I would use for the grocery store.  Or I would transfer it to my blockchain.info iPhone app (which I keep empty until the day I need to scan a QR code while I'm away from my computer).
But the bulk of my coins I treat like gold coins and keep then under lock and key.  If you are concerned with the flexibility of a paper wallet and don't like the idea of not being able to spend part of it then make a lot of paper wallets.  Bitaddress.org lets you make as many as you want.  I made a separate one for each bitcoin I was cold-storing.  They print 3 to a page.  That way when I use one, I will probably just keep the change on blockchain's wallet or send to one of my multibit wallets.

I was debating with a friend who I was trying to introduce to Bitcoin.  It seems the biggest hurdle that people need to cross to at least *understand* Bitcoin is that there is an appeal to having it as alternative currency.  I blathered on about liquidity, decentralized transaction register, anti-inflation seeding, etc.  none of it took hold.
Finally I got through with this explanation.  Every currency (until now) required a powerful entity to control it.  Fiat currencies were the only option, as well as a centrally controlled register.  But now imagine if Bitcoin existed first.  In that reality, the idea that anyone would want a government to control their currency is laughable.  I have trouble trusting the Monopoly banker.

Actually, WoodKoins, your original interpretation is correct.  Here is the text from the btc38 article, translated by Google.  I bolded the relevant part.
Here is the btc38 article: 
Translated text (anyone can Google translate it themself):
As the central bank ban third-party payment institutions prepaid cash withdrawal services for Bitcoin, Wright currency trading platform, third-party payment companies in China broke Bitcoin recharge channels, Bitcoin China in December 18 ended the yuan recharge service, but a bit Dollar Chinese did not give up, still looking for a new way of life.
Nicholls, founder of Bitcoin Chinese Yuan has said that our destiny is in the hands of regulators and to some extent in the hands of the government; If trading platform can not be maintained, and I guarantee that we will find a new model, the introduction of new products and services, so that our users continue to use bitcoins.
In the December 20 bitcoins China has finally launched a new project "currency lock" - "currency lock" is Bitcoin China to build a new security bitcoin wallet services so that users do not need to understand the complicated management wallet technical problems. Currency lock "the safest way to store the user's offline Bitcoin, a process known as cold storage, it can ensure that your wallet will not be stolen by hackers online. Against your" money locked "account we have a bank-level security to protect the future, China Bitcoin (BTC China) users can send your bitcoins safely stored in bitcoins China (BTC China) of "currency locked" inside.
Although this address security issues Bitcoin store, but it does not solve the problem of the yuan recharge. Nicholls Yuan has said that if China did not find any bitcoin partners, the company is likely to explore ways to cooperate in the case of third-party companies do not accept RMB stored value. This indicates Nicholls yuan renminbi want to find a way of stored value, which is the way foreign withdrawals and recharge some big trading platform coincide. As banks in the United States prohibit Bitcoin-related businesses to open bank accounts, they had to find a new way to recharge - redemption code. **Currently, BTC-E, 796, MT.GOX etc. Support redemption code. Meanwhile, Bitcoin Chinese yuan recharge and withdrawals emergence of a new way - BTCC recharge codes.
Withdraw the BTCC code is a new way to cash provided bitcoin China.** Your cash will be deposited in a piece of code, you may want to get into direct trading platform to other prepaid users.
We offer you the BTCC code will be divided into two sections, the first half of you can provide to the user's query cash buyer BTCC code stored in the platform bitcoins Chinese yuan recharge page, a half section if provided to the other party, the other party will BTC China to complete the recharge.
Perhaps with an international perspective Nicholls dollars are inseparable, he may not want to repeat MT.GOX bitcoin China's past. Seeking Bitcoin fire when national regulators to respond positively when the country began to regulatory and relevant industry to launch a new business in the case of compliance with the law.

I don't fully understand that message.  If I "purchased" 1BTC today, it would be "honored" at the Friday price?  First, they said they reached the limit for the day.  I would expect that would mean that tomorrow you could start buying again.   Second, why would they peg at Friday's price?  That doesn't seem like sound business because a sharp increase would hurt their balance sheet.  Thus, I've concluded I must be missing the basic meaning of the message.

EDIT:  ok now it seems that this new money.  People are confusing redemption codes with recharge codes.

I don't want to be the bearer of bad news but I was worried about getting stuck in that very same predicament so I researched it.  Mt Gox (via their IRC channel) told me that you have to verify and other redditors confirmed.   If it makes you feel any better, I think it's total bullshit. They should make you verify to FUND it if they are going to make you verify to WITHDRAW it.   
Bitstamp on the other hand will make you verify to FUND it so you don't get stuck like you did.
Honestly, I would just take a picture of your license or whatever else they need and get verified.  You can always buy and sell on there and then when you are ready to stop, just convert all fiat back to BTC and transfer it out.   I debated doing it anyway, but then found BTC-e which saved me the hassle.

No, no.  He's an artificial intelligence working with the scientists who created him to find a way to get access to massive amount of computing power, as well as other necessary resources, to allow his brain to evolve.  Hence the hash rate of the bitcoin network and taking over the monetary system.
