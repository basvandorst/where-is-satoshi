Lol people downvoted the article. That’s pretty pathetic. Interesting article and because you have to read, the illiterates just downvote because it’s not filled with colorful pictures. 
That’s the pettiness of Reddit ��

Hi everyone - the app I use to TRACK Bitcoin is Robinhood. I do some stock and have a few dollars on BTC but primarily keep my coins in a wallet. 
I just like the Robinhood UI and graphics for tracking and the newsfeed they have for relevant topics you invest in. 
Even though RH isn’t ideal and takes time for money to be deposited you CAN make money and take it home with you. The day RH allows users to hold actual BTC like a wallet will be awesome but that isn’t today.

no just decided to post a meme
@_date: 2019-11-10 23:14:21
Oh I just wanted to post how fast BTC changes. One second you’re losing and the next BAM! Doubled your money lol

Day you give up will be the day it skyrockets to $100k lol
@_date: 2019-11-14 14:30:28
Not exactly concerned with that.

This is what makes Bitcoin fun though!! It’s payday one second and then it’s fuck I’m in debt again lol

I’ve never had a processing issue except for transferring fiat to my bank account. When depositing and investing it’s been instant. 
So far.

Uhh....this is pretty much the definition of any of us who hold even .000001 of crypto though. If you own crypto currency you're betting on its price.
Robinhood...or holding actual coin....you're betting and hoping that the price explodes up to 50,000 - 100,000+.
That's what makes it so much fun!

 Almost lol

Like I said I have a few dollars but the majority of my funding is on my own coin in a wallet. Like Coinbase and a private wallet
@_date: 2019-11-12 14:54:45
Funny how people like to tell others what to do. 
Also I only use it for graphics and news like I’ve stated before. ��
@_date: 2019-09-17 01:22:50
Yeah that garbage. It’s so irritating. I downvoted it no matter what.
@_date: 2019-09-16 22:43:52
Lol I almost downvoted this instantly thinking it was that stupid engineering ad that doesn’t go away
@_date: 2019-09-23 14:19:22
This company must spend thousands to promote that Ad...pretty sure they aren't even aware at how hated it has become. 
It's pretty much doing the opposite of what Marketing is expected to do.
