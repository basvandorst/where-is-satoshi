You have really shit economics.
Looks like *your* politics are the politics of **freeloading**.
That means you **suck** (quite literally you suck off the public teat).

The Trump admin is probably the greatest assemblage of experts in history. It's bad for libtards, I agree, but good for Americans.
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:12:04
You did insult him, like all libtards do, when presented with an argument of substance that you can't refute. 
It's all you have left.  
And it's "brakes" not "breaks".  Fucking illiterate.

Hi Kiara,
Did anything ever happen to the ones who attacked you?
Police reports filed? Civil suits started?

You sound like an obamabot who's fully bought in to his doublespeak.
I'll bet you don't even have the slightest CLUE what the net neutrality issue is all about.
@_date: 2017-02-16 23:53:00
correct. net neutrality is garbage and only a anti-liberty moron would support it.  no /s

In general Trump supporters are WAY smarter than anti-Trump morons. Most Trump supporters I know are cryptocurrency-savvy

It has not been in the past. But it will be now.

Interesting that you think those two things are necessarily connected.
I wonder which misconceptions you are under that makes you think that?
@_date: 2017-02-16 23:51:54
Agree, Mulvaney is awesome!

Correct, Trump is as anti-establishment as you can get.  If you thought his personal wealth has something to do with it, you were mistaken.
Your bitch, Hillary, however was 100% establishment.

I watched them all, and I have especially high hopes for DeVos. She is, above all, a *reformer*. And massive reformation is exactly what is needed  to fix the broken education system in this country.

Trump isn't establishment. He's anti-establishment.
