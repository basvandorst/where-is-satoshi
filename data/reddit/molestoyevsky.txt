One cannot have a society based on consent if it is brought about by force. It's fine if you are disinterested in exploring anarchist philosophy -- there are a great many schools of thought I have no time for. But to make a series of assumptions based on that disinterest and to criticize a monolith of your own creation is rude in addition to being inaccurate. Adherence to pacifism is the bedrock of anarchist philosophy. 
If this seems like a "No True Scotsman" sort of fallacy, consider for a moment that sometimes ideas have a life of their own outside of the circles in which they were created. If a young person is angry and loves the (A) symbol and throws a brick through a window, do you imagine that they did so from reading "The Road to Serfdom?" Or did they adopt the symbol of a philosophy to which they have no relation while doing an immoral act? And, if the community that generated the symbol never advocated that immoral act, do they bear responsibility for the actions of others? I would say "no." 
I would argue that blaming the actions of the violent on a non-violent philosophy is  mistaken for multiple reasons, not just because of the inherent ideological disagreement, but also because there's an odd assumption that the violence done is done because of a difference in ideology between the victim and perpetrator. More than likely, their ideological framework is identical or similar. Slavoj Zizek has a fairly good explanation of this:
