God gave animals claws, He gave Angels instant faith (angels are like faith robots), but He gave humans a keen, rational, skeptical mind. 
The sort of faith God wants humans to have is not something that happens instantly, or something that a child is capable of having.  A true, mature, adult faith takes years to strengthen, and can be both profoundly deep and wracked with doubt. 
For humans are not angels, we are not programmed with faith and thus we must discover it using the tool God gave us, our rational mind.
This is why we must reject fraudulent clerics and corrupt institutions.  This is why we must not cover up child sex abuse.  This is why we must not try to suppress science, dissent, or rational inquiry. 
An atheist is simply someone who is on the beginning of the honest journey that God has created for humans.  Someone who strongly claims (or flouts) faith, or who emphasizes the humbling wonderment of the mysterious phenomena in our world, is disavowing God's gift and pantomiming something he/she does not actually have. 
If God wanted humans to all have faith he'd have simply made us angels.  We instead got a rational mind, and we honor God by using it.
Severe, existential doubt is the human condition of faith.  We can never achieve 100% faith, our rational mind will simply not let us.  But we can live a life that honors God through our deeds and actions, with no "belief" litmust test as was popular in the dark ages.

I assume you are a Christian?

Uh, I'm an atheist, just trying to help convert the religious person my comment was in reply to.

Don't all derivatives probabilistically neutralize to $0 ?
