My thinking was that everyone has a price and buying up enough would kill it so people would sell before it becomes worthless.
Banks just make up money, so if there was a global collaborative effort on the part of banks it would be just a matter of being temporarily set back in lieu of future interests.
Killing off Bitcoin would basically turn all altcoin worthless as like play money, maybe for fun but nothing to be considered serious currency.

In some ways the mentality of hoarding them would be equally undermine Bitcoin, which seems to be the most common response so far.

Perhaps you should take a moment and try to consider why this person you highly respect has this opinion of the foundation. I have only seen your recent communications but it seems to me that you are oblivious of how the outside see the what is happening.

It would be the bitcoin infrastructure which it would be trying to kill. No real analogy with Gold.

Hope they enjoy the 21 BTC worth of bad publicity.

I am pretty sure all the interface programming is in Qt, so the better place to point any would be designer is to [is here]( There are some Qt UI Designing software out there, the one that comes with Qt is called QtCreator.
Like it is suggested by it is not an easy task but this information is the real starting point to redesigning the UI.

Like if you want to know how much gold you have you look at your gold, but for Bitcoin you have to ask all the nodes how many Bitcoins you have.

An inaccuracy I noticed that he said Bitcoin was instantaneous and free.

I don't know much about Mike but the problems he pointed out were spot on. Writing it all off as a conspiracy is just denial.

Streissand effect? The more they want to bury it the stronger it will become.

It's a bit of a stupid question. Like "How many would invest in a currency start up?", question doesn't mean anything and neither does the response.

Just curious, why would the bitcoin community want to be associated with Ross Ulbricht's defence? As I see it he did the wrong thing.

This sounds just like propaganda, I don't think anyone would be happy about not being able to withdraw 93% of their holding.
