Hopefully we will see major adoption in the next 5 to 10 years.  I don’t agree with the inferior tech. Bitcoin has one of the best developers and most enthiousiastic community and the tech looks nothing like it used 8 years ago. If all of these other coins would get the same amount of traffic and major adoption they would probably face much bigger problems because the tech hasn’t “matured” if that makes sense.
It might be a bit cliché to compare bitcoin to the internet but I’m gonna do it anyway. In 1992-94 (early days of the internet) one of the arguments was that the internet would never work because  no one would be able to find anything on it. Well guess what some guys invented Google. Stuff like this can also be build on top of the bitcoin network to counter problems bitcoin has now e.g LN. 
If you are not convinced or want to know more watch some of Andreas Antonopoulos video’s. He can explain this stuff much better than I can.
Edit: spelling

If you are planning to hold on it for a few years it doesn’t matter if you buy today or tomorrow imo.

By importing your 12 word seed you are not sending your btc from Exodus to electrum. You are just accessing your funds with a different program but they are still in the same wallet. Your wallet is not tied to Exodus if that makes sense?

What would you do if you were the inventor of bitcoin to test? Send the first transaction to yourself obviously. What was the first trasnsaction? Satoshi nakamoto to Hal Finney.
Conclusion: Hal Finney = Satoshi Nakamto

If she shouldn’t bitcoin will never be mainstream because 99% are like my mother even the younger generation.

Sure if you are in the crypto world for a while but what about new people? I am just imagining my mother (49) she would have no clue. Atleast I can tell here the difference. But what about others who don’t have children or someone else to point them in the right direction. They would have to rely on people on the internet and there is large community of bcash supporters...

Lol me too. Bought some NEO then, now only BTC. I guess everyone has to go through the rabbit hole.
