Worked for me, but you may have to try a few times sharp on the full hour.

Just to make sure: This is the only advice so far that you should follow…

It's unlikely to happen.
Check out this video: 
It makes the numbers we're dealing with a bit more catchy.

Go to gdax.com and deposit there from coinbase (free). Then send them wherever you want from gdax as it is free from there.

I think the beauty of giving is not about the value, but the gesture. And i never mentioned how much i gave, so how can you judge?

Looks good, but why is it free? How do they make money?

As long as he can't pay the medical school with BTC, where is the difference between exchanging it to FIAT and giving it to them, and just sending them BTC? In both cases his BTC would be gone from his wallet and someone else will have his BTC. (I know there actually is a difference, but as he can't pay with BTC, you get the point, right?)

Why should i feel bad? BTW they were very pleased. And yes, i gave away some other stuff, too.

If the govt is willing to pay that much it means that it’s worth much more. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 07:33:09
Best answer so far.

I was going to post that as well. What do you guys think about this video? I generally value his videos but would like to know your opinion.

With todays update it got even better as you can now install up to 18 apps on it:

Tech guy does his own research and decides on his own, or asks for advice.

Of course they are, but how many people do think know about the existence of hardware wallets. This is not about what we think is best and secure but a prediction of how mass adoption will look like from our current viewpoint.

Thanks! Didn't know that one, looks promising!

I got charged in Germany (Visa, Landesbank Berlin, 15€ fees). I immediately contacted them that I did not withdraw cash (that’s what was stated on the bill) and they refunded the fee. But I’m pretty sure that won’t work for much longer. I think the support guy just looked for a cash withdrawal in the statement, did not find one and then refunded. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 06:41:25
If you are in the US or UK, yes. In every other country: No!
But I got used to it;)

You're right there always is a way to hide things so that only you with your current knowledge can restore the key. But that excludes circumstances like memory loss (Imagine getting hit on the head very hard), or death. (You can't inherit  the seed if only you know how it is hidden. Supposing that you want to inherit)
@_date: 2018-02-16 06:46:45
If you want to learn about how to protect your seed/private key have a look at this thread: 
I had questions about this and got great replies. 
@_date: 2018-02-10 11:21:05
As soon as they implemented SegWit.

If this would be essential for mass adoption then we can bury crypto right now. The average Joe will use Windows or maybe MacOS.
And if you're a tech guy you don't need advice and use what you think is right.
For the average Joe I think wallets stored on mobile devices are the most secure. As long as they are not rooted.

Sounds interesting but is no one afraid of the self fulfilling prophecy it might introduce if this gets to much attention?
@_date: 2018-04-15 06:42:02
Yep, definitely Tesla. It‘s an advanced car, not only some fancy Italian with an engine technology from the past century.
