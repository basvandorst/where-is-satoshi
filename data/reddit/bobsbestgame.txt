I tried to send ETH from my Coinomi wallet to kraken to purchase some altcoins on Christmas. I generated an eth address, sent it, and... Nothing. Refreshed my kraken page and the address no longer existed! It was a proper address so it sent, but the address was no longer linked to my account. According to kraken support (over a week later, and changing upon a link to escalate the ticket...) the address was not generated from their website so my $50 worth of eth is just.. Gone now. Theres been 4 different coins that have gone up significantly that I could have used that to buy!

Do you have a job? Could you be putting this money into a 401k or your Roth IRA? There's where I would park that kind of money if I didn't know anything about bitcoin. In the meantime, [start here]( too learn more about bitcoin. If you want to learn price action, volatility, etc then I would watch videos on [YouTube]( and go to [babypips](

This is a big red flag friend. The word probably tells me you have no idea what's going on price action wise. Do more research, and if in one month from now, make your decision. Don't fomo in if it starts pumping either. Get just a little more educated on this. In one month from now, the price of btc will be different, but the value of the dollar isn't going anywhere in that amount of time, and you'll be more educated to make the decision yourself. Good luck out there!
