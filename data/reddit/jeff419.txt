This question please

I have a bunch of dinars in my drawer at home. Didn't think they were worth anything but looks like I have a couple hundred dollars sitting there.
Anyone want to buy some dinars?

What's the best way to liquidate large volume of coins like this? Mtgox?
@_date: 2012-05-31 06:34:49
Probably using us to crack captchas

They got caught moving $60 trillion. The fine was appx 4 weeks profits.

Try coinbase.com I've been using it and it seems pretty legit. 
@_date: 2013-03-25 21:10:54
Bullshit. This is the backroom of a Kinkos.

Bitpay if you run an ecommerce website.
Coinbase if you are manually charging each client or don't have many products.

1500 is nothing, no one cares. Selling via coinbase.com is effortless and usually pays out 2-4 days later.

One of my runners got hit for half real half fake $100 bills on a thousand dollar order. $20 gets you a counterfeit checker with UV and magnetic ink detection. Don't leave for a trade without it.

The bitcoin foundation needs to submit an amicus brief (i think that's the term) supporting these guys.

Bancbox makes this super easy compared to a few years ago.

I don't think $30k is anywhere close to enough seed money. Ask for enough or don't waste everyone's time.

June of what year?

Used Gyft this week and worked like a charm. 
@_date: 2013-05-15 01:01:30
I got a security warning from that website.

I buy &amp; sell on localbitcoins.com and so far I have had nothing but good experiences. 
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:44:15
If you're in LA I'm also jeff419 on localbitcoins. Can handle that whenever is good for you.
@_date: 2013-07-13 00:10:06
I've done that size and larger transactions off localbitcoins.com. Just meet somewhere smart and there's not much to worry about. Banks, nice hotel lobbies, coffee shops, etc all work well.

Occasionally good ideas and potential large exits coexist. Bitcoin is most certainly an area with a lot of both. 
FYI, accelerators usually work with companies before they raise any VC money. General path is:
Idea with cofounders doing early legwork and development. 
Join accelerator, get small investment, from a few grand up to $100k and a whole lot of mentoring and introductions. 
The cream that comes through that process will do a seed round with angels or sometimes skip straight to a VC round. 
I went through Amplify.la with the founders of the company I work at and it was a great experience. 
I also know Adam and he's super cool so if you get in you'll be in a great environment to start a business.

There are payment solutions that give you a token and store payment options of your customers for you. The guys at ProPay.com can most likely help you out.

I buy and sell all the time on their and a quick meet is easier than Western Union.

They already have a distribution deal with PayPal that's most likely exclusive.

We made progress but it was offset offset by &lt;insert unforseen circumstance&gt;
@_date: 2013-01-22 21:34:06
I'm pretty sure there's already a website that does that.

Buy bitcoins off localbitcoins.com
Send them to recipient's wallet on localbitcoins.com
Recipient sells them via localbitcoins.com
Or even faster if you have an account with good feedback already:
Post sell offer near recipient 
Have recipient go to meet buyer with the text message code to release btc from escrow. 
That's super easy and for anyone sending funds home on a regular basis a it will save money and allow the recipient to meet fellow bitcoin enthusiasts in their area.

I was at this event today and I'd say Peter did a good job considering the audience. Most of them are so entrenched in the status quo that it's probably better they don't realize the true disruptive potential of bitcoin. 
I also got his coin from the brain wallet so I may be biased.

It won't be that terrorists discover bitcoin. They'll just say using  bitcoin makes you a terrorist because 'fuck you' and proceed with the drone strikes on anyone mining coins who isn't using a VPN.
