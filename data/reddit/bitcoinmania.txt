Bitcoin will pay the rent, help me with my  tuition fees and take the strain off someone who is crazy enough to call himself bitcoinmania in the first place. Bitcoin is like the Zimbabwe dollar, a troll currency just waiting to troll more people into accepting.
I'm a troll, but boy I have profited from Bitcoin without even investing that much into it. My total bitcoin assets is worth about two weeks rent at current prices.

Also the bitcoin for ducks is from my brother, who loves collecting rubber ducks. I threw a cheap rubber duck in hyde park in London and lost it, but the other birds investigated him as a "real" duck. And duck coins are as real as "human coins". The £10 note has Charles Darwin on it for a reason.

I refer to Bitcoins as buttcoins and trollcoins in a satirical but actually serious way. I'm doing most of my post heres for the lulz. I also combine it with memes from previous economic bubbles and of course my love of railways. It's all about spreading the idea. I tell taxi drivers about Bitcoin, I tell railway employees about Bitcoin, I even intend to do academic papers and dissertations for my courses using Bitcoin-based economics. I'm ready to push Bitcoin to the ultimate limit.

I own around 1.04 BTC (1 In cascasius form, .04 mined). I'm not spending them until I can buy my groceries at the supermarket with them, buy my diesel for my car with them and most importantly the "old" banks accept bitcoins as "real" money. Even then, I see the events of this month as an important "stress test" for bitcoin. We still got another bubble due at block 420,000, 630,000, 840,000, and so on. Bitcoin taught me some basic budgeting skills and even my mother who is very hardworking and frugal accepts bitcoin as a good investment and told me to HOLD until 2015!
I have got a small business which makes money fixing computers, with Windows XP support expiring I have a lot of installs on my plate. I give out discounts for those who opt to upgrade to Linux or accept a bit coin miner installed on their computer with their permission.

Britain is known as a nation of shop keepers. Maybe I should set up my own shop with a IRL presense and offer bitcoin discounts. Maybe instead of a "pound shop" (popular in the UK) with a "bit shop". 1 BTC pays for a tank of petrol and diesel now, so independents will love it. I will experiment with local cash and carries like Makro and try selling soft drinks in a bit coin vending machine for example.
Also The UK retail industry is still flummoxed by horse meat, so may be we can get Bronies behind this and offer to buy all the my little pony toys with bitcoins.
