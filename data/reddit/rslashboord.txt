STOP APOLOGISING. lol
You helped me, you did great. I only speak one language, so don't worry about it.
I thought I would be sitting around waiting until Bitcoin got high enough to turn my $3 of BTC into $15 so I could get my $1 out lol.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:33:27
LOL! You're input was fine the first time, thank you!

I’m sorry to say that my $3-9 in bitcoin will always be stuck on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:24:58
I have change from 1 transaction I wanted to use bitcoin for. What was once $2.84 usd of unusable BTC is now $9.00 usd of unusable BTC stuck behind a Coinbase $14 transaction fee.

Nice edit to add the insult. What’s even better is that my comment IS worth karma. Where as you’re at a net loss so far in our interactions.

Even worse. I bought them at some point in 2012 and I have no idea where that USB drive is.

Monopoly money is money, and of no value. The definition of money doesn’t include the word value or worth. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:40:43
It’s definitely gone. I’ve moved so much and I couldn’t tell you how much was on it. IIRC it was like 8-13 BTC or something. I wanna say I spent like $20 and got $14 worth after transactions. So many similar numbers I can’t remember. 
But 1 whole bitcoin would make me happy lol. 
@_date: 2018-09-30 00:06:46
Bullshit. You can print your own money. It’s just not worth anything. Much like this boomer meme. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:26:22
Although I did buy $20 of another coin that is now around $260-300. So I’ve got that going for me. 
Actually in all seriousness I’m researching / sourcing antminers for someone.

In the sense of risk and reward yes. High risk and high reward are hand in hand. It allows for bad actors within market &amp; manipulation of the market. It makes no assumption that the product is illegal - only a high risk one.
You can say it applies, but it’s a naive &amp; incomplete view because it’s so vague.
It’s like saying you’re a tax paying citizen because you pay taxes on your illegal income, legally. Yeah, sure, you’re correct. But you’re not fully encompassing the picture.
Prohibition will always prevent a strong market, regardless of the efficiency of the rest of the process. 
This is accurately reflected by cannabis advancing to a futures market in federally legal areas. They can sell flower on the stem the same way they sell a pig still getting fat.

Alcohol and cannabis are different examples though. Booze can be stilled from readily available, low cost produce at any location. Meaning booze was more prevalent, required less transportation (as an illicit substance) and also made it more easily counterfeited. 
Cannabis has to be grown in certain conditions, then transported to areas with increased value and sold again. Cannabis is also harder to counterfeit, without extraction.

I’m talking about indoor as well. California allows for industrial and agricultural zoning for cannabis. Any legalized municipality does. 
We grow better weed.  We grow more weed. 
We’re talking about the logistics, economics and legal impact of prohibition.
Not anecdotal trailer parks with almost no impact in comparison. No one wants trailer weed, and trailer weed can sustain the market.

Your original post wasn’t about consuming anything. It was about the ineffectiveness of prohibition.
Prohibition doesn’t just exist on final product or ubiquitously across borders. There’s lots of steps and risk before you consume anything.
@_date: 2019-06-07 19:20:11
No I’m not. Market efficiency has almost no bearing on the current market - without prohibition. The only places automating their cultivation are doing so with expressed permission from the government. 
The prices are not reflective of the product availability, but the volatility of the market.
No matter how efficient and cost effective your product is, if it can be confiscated and removed from the market. No insurance. No subsidies. 
The price reflects that someone at some point will take a huge loss. - solely because of prohibition. 
You can say its market efficiency all you want, but it’s a non factor what the efficiency is if prohibition exists.

It is but it isn’t. Yes you can grow your own small plant in an apartment. The same way you can brew your own beer. 
Production isn’t just logistics in a black market. 
The dollar amounts alone are reflective of that. 
Cannabis doesn’t cost any more “logistically” to grow than corn or potatoes. So why isn’t corn $1,800 a pound or cannabis sold at farmers markets on the side of road? Because they’re different. 
If you grow corn and your crop is stolen, you call the cops. Cold snap ruined your crop? Subsidies exist. Fire? Insurance exists. 
None of these are options on a black market product. So no, it’s not just logistics.
@_date: 2019-06-07 18:12:45
Yes and no. Cannabis grows better under certain conditions. So botanically, yea you’re correct. 
However, because of borders this isn’t practical. Even with “legalization” 85% of California cannabis is still black market.
Legalized states have the upper hand by allowing the cultivation, at scale. You’re allowed to control the conditions &amp; invest the money without worrying about legal trouble. You can abandon or leave a still without too much loss of investment. 
You can’t abandon your plants &amp; ever be made whole again. 
So you’re ability comes down to whether or not you get caught, while not cultivating in a legal state. There’s no “step” where cannabis is legal in this process. 
Transporting potatoes across state line to then manufacture vodka is just a different game with risk at different points.

Good job with this. I had a shower thought the other day about making a site that ran off Amazon API but accepted only crypto. This is an easier option all round. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 05:30:26
Why. If we apparently go in a time loop.

Who is the money owed to? How the fuck are they solvent? How can we ever pay back debt when every dollar was created with interest? Where’s my super suit?

Also, banks don’t see a problem with Robin Hood. Since you’re moving your liquid to them, and not a a crypto exchange - you are less likely to be flagged by your bank. They don’t know what you bought on RH. They always know that you’re not buying FIAT on Coinbase.

All of the banks I deal with are American banks. It’s a bank to bank &amp; contract to contract issue as it’s not illegal to deal in crypto.
@_date: 2019-05-04 20:16:08
Not talking about IRS or SEC. Banks are private entities who can choose to not have you as a customer. Additionally, when you open a bank account you sign a contract. That contract can stipulate what you are and are not allowed to put through the bank account. 
e.g. the bank has no control over whether or not you have a license to sell cars. If they find out you’re selling more cars than you’re licensed for, they can close your accounts.

This is correct. All of my business account paperwork has “crypto currency” right next to “medicinal or recreational cannabis” as economies I am not allowed to use those accounts to cross over into.
