I can understand that. I feel as if it is less about them coming to this sub &amp; more about how Bitcoin is being perceived by the public.

I marked your words.
I tagged you "Says China will un-ban Bitcoin in a few years (April 9, 2014)"

What are you countering? I don't grasp what I left out that you see as relevant to the conversation. You left out a huge chunk of what he was saying in your paraphrasing quote.

Are you a journalist? Read the whole sentence.


was saying that they are in it for the long haul, whether it gets better or crashes completely.

It is known.

Because its so hard to simply answer it with "No." Must wreck your whole day,  huh? Get over yourself. 
It's not about the cashier making a change happen. It's about the "network effect" increasing awareness of BTC.

As with any sub you are going to have to wade through crap to get what you really want out of it. That is the nature of public forums.
@_date: 2014-03-10 22:31:27
I know it isn't quite ready to go that route. I just feel the sub could take itself more seriously. I see Dogecoin get mocked because of it quirkiness, but that is also what some love it for. Bitcoin seems to want to be the 'Professional" crypto (and is already) so I feel the sub should treat it as such.

Nothing was really said to require citation. It was all anecdotal.

You are mistaken. Ecstasy is usually MDMA or MDA cut with other drugs &amp; pressed into pills with bonder. MDMA, aka Molly, is usually pure powder in a capsule.

Wrong coin.

reddit can't resist when you say Do Not Upvote in the title.

Good on ya!

From Wikipedia:


So while you are correct that the term Ecstasy is correlated to MDMA &amp; sometimes used as a synonym, it is worth noting that it causes confusion in many circles to refer to it as such.

Uhhh.... they make &amp; distribute all of our [coins](

I tried to [raise this discussion]( almost a year ago &amp; was pretty much shot down in the same manner. Some people don't see how it is detrimental to the average person's view of the currency.

If you're gonna correct someone you should use the correct lyrics yourself. Its "And if I'm lucky, you might just give it a little kiss."
