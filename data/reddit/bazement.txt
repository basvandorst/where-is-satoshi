You're right, these companies should understand the real meaning of "to accept bitcoin".
For me, if a company is converting to dollar, it's not really accepting bitcoin. They are only accepting it if they USE the bitcoin they receive to pay their suppliers and employees.

It makes no sense to encrypt the same data twice. If one is going to brute force, then, in the end, they could bypass all your dozens layers of encryption by bruteforcing just one layer, which is the private key itself.

@_date: 2014-11-19 15:46:29
Instead of "bits", let's call it "New Bitcoin".
- "New Bitcoin" indicates that it's still Bitcoin. "Bits" can make the user think it's one of the hundreds of altcoins.
- Eventually, after a few years, the "New" part will be naturally dropped and people will refer it to just "bitcoin" again.
- No confusion.  People think that this could cause some kind of confusion, like are we talking about the new bitcoin or the old one? Fortunately, this won't happen because of "context". Imagine a coffee for 5,000 nbtc(new bitcoin), what do you assume, that it's 2 dollars or 2,000,000 dollars coffee that we're talking about?
this redenomination strategy was successfully employed in many countries ion the past:
Yugoslavia "New Dinar"
Peruvian "Nuevo Sol"
Turkish "New Lira"
New Taiwan Dollar
New Turkmenistan Manat
Brazilian "New Cruzado"
French "New Franc"
- none

@_date: 2014-10-28 23:25:20
It's different. Using "New Bitcoin" we are indicating that we are still talking about Bitcoin whereas Bits is the same as if we were creating another altcoin.

It's very simple.
Big businesses accepting BTC actually drive the price down. Not sure why people think the other way.
BTC price will only go up if instead of businesses accepting it, we begin to see people actually receive their salaries in BTC.
SO instead of begging for Wikipedia and the likes to accept BTC, ask them to pay their employees in BTC.

@_date: 2014-12-29 23:38:21


Seriously, I never heard someone ask about "the **new** bitcoin", I think you're just imagining something that really doesn't happen.


It's either redenominating or forcing people to use awkward decimals. And history proves that people are somewhat used to redenominate currencies using the prefix "new", just some examples for you:
Yugoslavia "New Dinar"
Peruvian "Nuevo Sol"
Turkish "New Lira"
New Taiwan Dollar
New Turkmenistan Manat
Brazilian "New Cruzado"
French "New Franc"
I think the problem is that Bitcoin is being controlled by people who come from a culture(America et al) that never experienced redenomination before and therefore, these people don't know exactly how to do it and come up with absurdities such as "bits".


Well you still have to explain "bits" or "millibits" or whatever is the unit. Besides, using prefixes such as "new" is the only way to actually change the value of satoshis associated with the word "bitcoin" when, after a few years, people **drop** the "new" prefix and start using just "bitcoin" alone. NO other alternative has this potential.
Plus "bits" is being pushed by the likes of "Bitpay" which are actually very much interested that the new unit name is "Bits" for marketing purposes, **for their own gain**. You guys complain about Visa and mastercard but you don't even notice that you're helping to create another similar one in the bitcoin world.
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:09:18

You are not storing BTC in the machine, you are just using it to generate  the private keys which you will store on the paper. That's all.
Of course this process has a minuscule chance of being compromised like any other alternative.

The moment you load the private key into a computer to do a transaction, it's not cold storage anymore.
But yes, like you said, to get screwed, the user would have to load the private key, do a "partial" payment, and then go back and delete the wallet file without proper backup. That's just like burning dollar bills.

It's not so complicated
1) download bitaddress.org and save it to a removable media
2) boot from Live CD
3) access the saved bitaddress file and generate wallets
4) print wallets
5) optionally, save wallet to a usb stick, as a backup, should something happens to the printed paper
6) send BTC to public addresses
I assume cold storage is something to store BTC, not using it for daily transactions right? So the point of cold storage is to not have change addresses.

That wouldn't happen, there's a 1,000,000x difference. So imagine the article is talking about a coffee costing 5,000 nbtc(new bitcoin), so what do you assume, that it's 2 dollars or 2,000,000 dollars coffee that he's talking about?
I actually think that the names should be similar to indicate the user that it's the same thing, just the "new version". You give it a different name, it's the same as creating an "alt coin" in the mind of the user, he might as well go buy dogecoin instead, since it's also a totally different name.

Redenomination in the case of bitcoin is because of its valuation, not devaluation. Also calling it "bits" is also a redenomination, isn't it?




that's it? your argument against "new bitcoin" is because your friend asked about "the new bitcoin thing"?

Convert the ones you receive? What bitcoin are you receiving if these companies convert to dollars instantly? To pay with bitcoin, people must get it in the first place. Buying BTC at an exchange just to buy something and then have this BTC instantly converted back to dollars is inefficient and borderline dumb.

I agree that something needs to be done about this issue. If we want widespread adoption, we have to solve this unit problem or else the year of Bitcoin could become like the year of the Linux desktop.
But like many others I dislike the term "bits".
Here's another idea.
Name the 0.001BTC the "New Bitcoin". So the "New Bitcoin" is equal to 0.5 USD.
I think that the new denomination should have "Bitcoin" somewhere in the name, that's why "New Bitcoin". This is common practice in currency reforms, like the German Mark always kept the name "Mark" through the several currency reforms.

In Step 12, you make a test payment. It only tests if your Public Key is working. But what if the corresponding Private Key generated by bitaddress doesn't actually match the public key? There's no way to test that without defeating the purpose of making a cold storage, right?
@_date: 2014-09-02 17:49:30

Again... looks like you have immense trouble comprehending text. I was never disputing the possibility of the Windows host being infected! What I am comparing is:
Trezor exploit vs Guest OS compromise via an infected host OS in a virtual machine setup.

Everything you said could also be said about Trezor.
I already know you're going to say about signed firmware but even this does not prevent attacks. Quote from the article:


..then you say


Not sure why you mention this, it makes no sense. I never said that the host computer being infected is implausible, it's quite the opposite, I actually suggested a VM exactly because the host computer might be infected.


Same could be said about Trezor.
tl;dr trezor and VM could both be compromised. The difference between me and you is that you think one of the methods is 100% secure.
ps: I'm still waiting for a published report about a host keylogging a guest VM running Linux.
