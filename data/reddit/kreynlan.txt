Oh shit, I'm dumb. Yes, I'll start using gemini on my phone browser. 
What wallet would you recommend? I have btc and ethereum on coinbase approaching 1k

What's the advantage of a ledger?

I've used coinbase to buy since I got started. I'm still a bit of a beginner, but their ease of use and ability to buy on my phone makes it really noon friendly. Are there alternatives that give a similar experience?
Also I do not have a wallet, my coins are on their exchange. Any beginner friendly tips would be appreciated

I got verified on gemini a few days ago but they don't seem to have an app that I can take with me, I'd have to be on my computer. I'm out most of the day and I check in every few hours to see how the market is going and I'd like to be able to buy dips on the go

I've been trying to upload my ID to GDAX for weeks but every time it says it can't be read even after I used a pseudo-professional lighting setup and a dslr. I have a state ID but it should still work since I'm using the option to add a non - drivers license

Yeah, that's what I meant by phone. Idk what the issue could be, I just tried again
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:19:08
I tried both on both coinbase, where my account was initially made, and the GDAX website

There are suspicions of insider trading related to bcash being introduced very suddenly

Wanna explain that one?
Let's start with biohacking clubs.

23k student loans (still in school). This train is either going to the moon or the bottom of a ravine but I'm going to sit in my chair and enjoy the ride either way.

The problem with that is you're thinking of everything in USD cost. You had 100k in dollars. Then you had 90k in dollars and 1btc (pretending it was at 10k for number simplicity sake)
Price can go up or down, you still have those two things. Hodl is a way of not being impulsive and trying to play the market.
Don't invest more than you can afford to lose means don't put more in the initial investment than you're comfortable with losing in the event that it goes to 0.
They're two statements that have nothing to do with each other
Initial cost Does matter, it's probably the only thing that does matter expect for sell price if you're interested in cashing out.
Imagine you buy 1 btc at 10k
It rises to 20k, awesome, your 1 btc is worth 20k and you made a 10k profit.
Then it falls to 15k.
You didn't make a 5k loss, you still have a 5k profit. Profit is based on the return compared to the original investment.
If it dropped to 5k from 20k, you couldn't have lost 15k if you only put in 10k. You only lost 5k

Well you have quite a few posts with identifying info (including videos of someone I assume is you) and this here admitting you commit tax evasion

Underestimating your opponent is the first mistake. If you want to stay ahead you need to recognize their threat and find ways to minimize it. I don't know much about Brazil but I know that they're not completely backwards

Champion, maybe. I'll take your word for that. But champions don't always have a 100% success rate
