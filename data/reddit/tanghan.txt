Oh that is a pain the... 
I already backed up the wallet.dat in case I mess it up. 
But it is good to know that the bitcoins are safe even if they don't show up for me yet 
Thank you!

Yes, he doesn't have much himself but still was nice enough to share with me :-) 
Thank you for your advice and especially the links!

i don't think this will work? as I wrote, the Satoshi i was supposed to get hasn't even arrived yet / i haven't downloaded it yet

I am not too fond of spreading my info, especially a wallet all over the place, but this seems to be the only quick solution to my troubles. 
Thanks for the tip. 
How trustworthy is block chain. Info? 
Do I have to register for an account or is it an online tool I can use?

Thanks for your help, since calculating for profit is not an option i think I'll just do it until i have a little amount and rediscover it later ;-) Or buy after the next crash...
Is there a disadvantage to the wallets without all blockchain blocks? (what does that mean?) 
If not, why do they offer the one with them?
PS: some info on the Bitcoin for ad-viewing would be nice :)

What a let down :(
I'll definitely give GUIminer a try though, THank you :)
I also want to mention that i don't want to get rich off Bitcoin, i just want to have 1 or 2 because you know, its the currency of the future-people :P

Hey, that Bitcoin you gave me is already $0.14 :D 
I'm gonna be rich^^

Wow, i better whore myself out over at :D

i was wondering the very same thing
/edit I created a blockchain account and imported the wallet, but when i scan the private key from the wallet i just get an error :/

Well making money is off the table, i just thought it would be nice to have one or two Bitcoin.
The Jobs at mostly seem to be related to computer skills so i guess my best bet is to visit one of the Bitcoin selling websites and get myself some.
Maybe i'll find them again in a few years and purchase a flat in a norwegian ghetto :P

Thank you, Bitminer seems like an easy program that can help me getting started and since I learned my hardware won't help me much i might be well off in such a pool to get at least a fraction of Bitcoin in my wallet.
By the way, how is it possible to have a fraction of Bitcoin? isn't one Bitcoin=one solved equation or so?

Wow, Thank you for my first pieces of Bitcoin :D 
And this is a pretty neat bot, one that actually has an application - did you write it?
