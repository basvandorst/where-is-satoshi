That is what they sell. Store your bitcoin in a currency you trust more. Although you still need to have bitcoins use it in the end. So it still a bet on bitcoins, only not in its value. Probably, they aim in betting in the price of bitcoins, as they hold bitcoins, and then if you want them back in the future, you need to pay more. Really miss the bussiness model, what is problematic... for a company.

Yes! As well as it being updated by our doctor or pharmacy, if you given them the access to do so. The business part would be on the interaction with the platform (like Coinbase does with Bitcoin). All the structure of shared and private information is the key to people be comfortable in having and updating their information, doctors comfortable in the validity of the information available, and hospitals feeling comfortable on being compliant with regulations to dump their current database silos.

Hi,  are doing it, but their database is not open and crowd owned. The first step is to evaluate how a blockchain type technology can offer a level of privacy and anonymity, and still provide enough information to do big data research. Definitely a solution that provides both will revolutionize the sector and put patient in charge, not a private corporation.
