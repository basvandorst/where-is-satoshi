fyi you are going to get far different answers here than you would in @_date: 2016-08-01 07:31:40
Agreed that this is an unfortunate precedent but this is the reality of investing in a turing complete blockchain in the early days. Vitalik has said that there will come a point where ETH can no longer fork... but the implication is that until that time... another fork is very much on the table if a large amount were to be hacked again. I would once again support a fork in that scenario. I know this is anathema for the "code is law" people, but IMO that's fine. Blockchain maximalism is dead. Long live the multi chain universe.
@_date: 2016-08-01 07:56:47
A fork is necessary to rewrite specifically an egregious event that occured. I can't imagine a scenario where a rollback is needed by date or time and everything in between just gets wiped. In any case, that further reinforces my point about a blockchain multiverse. You can continue to use bitcoin for that. Don't accept ether if you believe the risk to be above a tolerable amount. 
@_date: 2016-08-01 08:22:08


Why is that? In my experience, it goes to exactly one address. In some cases they use a script to then spread it into decreasing amounts fanning out to an increasing number of addresses, but in such cases they are still (on ethereum &amp; bitcoin anyway) transparently trackable and easy to undo. In the case that someone happens to say buy a sizeable amount of some ether from the hacker immediately following the hack on IRC and for some reason isn't aware that a hack just went down... I think the community would scrutinize this transaction heavily and decide whether or not to include into into the hard fork or not. Again, I know that this is not easy for code is law people because it leaves some unknowns where you have to rely on other people potentially (gasp!), but again this is the reality of working with ether in the early days. As a large investor of ether I am quite comfortable with this risk as I feel the upside far outweighs potential downsides.

As long as we are being clear, let's be clear, shall we?
**The decision to fork was made because a thief holding that much ETH put the future of the move to POS into question.** 
Please stop perpetuating the myth of a bailout. It is convenient for those wishing to push some other agenda but simply wrong.

It does actually. It forces all use cases for 0 conf (of which there are many and have been cited ad nauseum elsewhere) onto another chain. As far as I am concerned this is the log that will break the camels back.

@_date: 2015-12-21 21:52:53
As much as I admire Satoshi this is entirely out of context here. This is about actually being there to lead but making it *seem* like the others are leading. What we have now is a complete clusterfuck as a result of a lack of leadership. We need some actual leadership from Satoshi right now more than ever.

The time for politeness is over. I am personally amazed at how composed Jeff has been and how well he is able to communicate given the urgency of the situation. 
@_date: 2015-06-28 06:05:05
i only see that being an issue when liquidity and a lack of merchant/exchange mechanisms are also an issue. In todays market this simply isnt a problem. Loss of confidence however could cause a depreciation in the rate of exchange... but that is not the same thing as hyperinflation.

@_date: 2015-06-19 04:17:49
Ok thanks for taking the time to write that Mark. Unfortunately I would be lying if I said that I understand all of what it was that you wrote there. I know that you guys are furiously writing code as best as you can to get this stuff done ASAP and you generally see Reddit/ bitcointalk as unnecessary distractions... but in the end the ones who will be making the decisions which code to move to will be the users of these outlets. I implore you to use some of that big budget you have at blockstream and hire someone who can take these ideas, ELI5 them/ timeline them with data projections, etc and properly present them in a PR fashion to Reddit so that the community here can fully digest the ideas that the majority of the programmers on core are holding onto regarding blocksize. I feel like what you just wrote is just the tip of the iceberg and I do not feel that your voices are accurately portrayed to the greater bitcoin community. Very few, if any of us have the time nor desire to sift through every dev email, so being informed about this process is more or less impossible. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 15:41:35


This is simply false. specifically does not want to raise the blocksize...
@_date: 2015-12-28 17:21:56
the last fork happened in a matter of hours... so no it will not take longer...
@_date: 2015-06-12 14:41:05
in that case there is no opportunity to increase the cap later via soft fork, rather than yet another hard fork.
@_date: 2015-06-18 18:16:21
I am in utter disbelief and shock here even though I (along with most of us here) saw this coming a long time ago. It's one thing to see things playing out in your head one way and another to see it actually happen. Zerohedge must be rejoicing in the streets.

anyone who has longer term experience with consensus would know that this is a great way to ensure failure. There will always be disagreement. Rigid immovable positions are by far the worst thing that can happen to a community.
@_date: 2015-06-18 23:46:36


Ok I'm sorry Mark but I am completely baffled by your answer. I am asking at what point you think we will need to increase the block size and your reply seems to be that we will not ever increase the block size because we will be doing the extra transactions off-chain.  You guys over at Blockstream need to come up with answers to questions raised by Gavin about the horizon for blocks filling and the consequences if we do not have these solutions we want to have before then because if you don't - well you will be building blockstreamcoin, not bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-06-04 11:04:18

I haven't seen any willingness as of yet to budge on this figure at all and segwit as has been discussed elsewhere, is not as of yet a scaling solution in all areas necessary. I agree a 2mb can kick along with segwit would be a compromise, but Jeff G's last proposal which was extremely conservative was rejected which leaves me with very little hope this will happen.


IMHO a single leader like Linus is not a great model for bitcoin for a number of reasons. That being said Satoshi's insight into the issues we are currently facing would be invaluable. I can only speak for myself here that this process is excruciatingly painful due to the mirage of a semblance of a "consensus" process. Consensus is seldom attained even in very small tightly knit communities who go through professionally facilitated community processes which help people work through their blockages in order to make compromises. What we are seeing now is a complete lack of compromise from one side in particular and it is quite literally tearing this community in two. A few choice words from Satoshi right now could nip that division in the bud.

Their solvency has been in question for 7 MONTHS. There was absolutely no reason to continue trading on there, but people were either arrogant or ignorant and continued to trade there irregardless of the clear risks posed by doing so. IMO the only people who are trapped there are arbitragers who were making the former 10% split between there and stamp. Do I have sympathy for them? Absolutely not. They were all traders taking calculated risks. They *might* have lost. I will not, nor should anyone else shed a tear.

The poorest counties control the water. If you live in CA you would know how big of an issue this is. These states can and will charge exorbitant amounts for access to this resource.  If this momey is then used for proper social programs then this will actually result in a far better situation for the residents than what their current situation provides. It is about providing the appropriate governance to a region which is clearly far too large to be managed efficiently or equitably. In other words it turns the titanic into a fleet of more agile boats with their own captains. Some initiatives which were impossible before wpuld now be possible because the views of the people of that regoon can be actually be represented in their government.

regarding your 3rd edit, no that is not a good idea. It essentially allows people to use your firm as a win-win sell short option. If they buy with coins and the price goes up afterwards, they have a huge incentive to return the product back to you, then turn around and sell the bit coin they got back and pay you (or your competitor) with cash instead. I stand behind bit coin 110%, which is why I am honest about the fact that it is not stable and therefore should not be used in the same way that fiat is currently used. In a few years when adoption is high enough, you can try and look at it as a currency in the same way, but until that saturation point is hit, it is primarily a wildly speculatively investment and should be treated as such. I am NOT saying that it does not make sense for you to accept bit coin. I absolutely am saying that you should! However you should accept it and convert all necessary gross profit into fiat to avoid any unnecessary fluctuation (for example, 90% fiat, 10% bitcoin). This lowers your risk significantly while still providing enough upside for your company to hold the coins. Not to mention the marketing value that accepting coins will do for you. Just look at what happened to overstock.

honestly I dont think its a good idea to point noobs towards storing their bitcoins on a computer. Unless they are running a stand alone unit that has never and will never touch the internet, its simply impossible to be sure that it is "virus free". The best solution is a paper wallet. If that is too complex for the noob, the second best is 2FA on something like blockchain.

As long as your wallet address isnt public knowledge (or they somehow figure out what your address is), then no they cant.

It would look like leadership. This is why people rally behind Gavin. You seem to hold in disdain the notion of being pro-active around community consensus instead only allowing yourself (or being capable of) being reactive to comments here on reddit. Please ask yourself *why* that is. If you are so confident in your position, why not be pro-active and SELL us on it? Do you really think that adding a few more lines of code to some other project you are working on is more important than consensus building of the most important issue facing bitcoin since at least 2011? 


This comment here basically encapsulates the difference in opinion between the two camps. The fact that you see this scenario as an acceptable one makes me question whether you actually understand money at all. Money is nothing more than faith and confidence. If we get into this situation, that is simply gone. The end. Bitcoin is set back decades in a best case situation because people will simply have lost faith in its ability to function. This is simply not something I, nor the other 80% of the community are willing to risk.

As you can see from this thread, there is a huge amount of support around Gavin because he is not just staying in the dev channels anymore, but explaining what needs to happen in layman's terms to the entire community. I have no idea what your proposal means (and I am guessing many others here don't either) though I assume it is a reasonable suggestion. If you want to have this idea taken seriously, I would highly recommend that you write an extensive ELI5 of how this will work and why it is more effective than Gavin's proposal... and then submit it to reddit. If you can convince us, then you can get the ball rolling to gaining community consensus for your idea. Otherwise I am afraid that Gavin's proposal is going to be taken without any serious consideration for yours purely because of his level of communcation with relavent parties not on the merit of the idea itself.

That is just not true. There was a specific point where some of the devs had a lightbulb moment and realized that on-chain scaling just wouldn't work at all and another solution was necessary. I believe that moment was exactly when realized that node count was going to suffer further as a result of blocksize going up and he was not willing to make that sacrifice. There is nothing wrong with that conclusion, it's just about the lack of communication around it that was problematic.

This isn't specifically a bitcoin problem, consensus is something all communities struggle with.

I am not sure what world you are living in, but if you have read any of this thread you might have some indication of where community sentiment (the sentiment that matters is community, not the core dev team) lies... it is with Gavin and not with the blockstream crew. 


Well if the code was done and it was tested and ready for deployment then I would tend to agree with you, but the fact is that it is not. There is no time to wait for that implementation unfortunately so if sidechains are implemented it will be for other reasons than blocksize (there are still multiple other use cases).

the point here is that the consumer doesnt have to care about how much is mined. The manufacturer (likely in partnership directly with 21 inc) takes on this risk and the consumer simply pays a lower price at the outset on the equipment. I expect 95% of consumers will not care to collect their 500 satoshis a year anyway, but for the 5% that do, they will create higher priced items where the users can collect the mining profits personally.

Hitting the blocksize cap and relying on RBF to create a fee market is pushing multiple classes of use cases onto other blockchains. For example, the idea that this currency can be used to help developing countries is then completely off the table. This creates a reason for fragmentation where there was none previously. As a result the "one chain for nearly all purposes" which was what Satoshi envisioned is no longer viable. IMO this is apocalyptic on the scale of expectations in crypto-currency.

There was no logical reason for anyone to move there previously, but in short order there will be - it will be free whereas bitcoin will not be. Why is this so hard to understand?

it is a huge boost for bitcoin in that case (unless its made illegal by a coalition of countries at the same time). Bitcoin fulfills its role as the gold to nation state currencies and the barriers to adoption drop through the floor.

If you, dear sock puppet are a core developer too cowardly to use your own account, I can see why. Do you remember a few years ago when this was the message that Satoshi, Gavin and the other leaders of the movement were spreading as the inevitable outcome? Because that message was changed without any communication to the user base this somehow makes them entitled? Do you think that setting the expectations of the userbase is somehow unnecessary? 
This logic is so aspergers-eque (only merit is in coding/ communication is unnecessary!) I am literally cringing here.

The value in gold is:
1. It's inherent scarcity
2. The thousands of years its been prized as an asset and medium of exchange
3. Borderless
4. (intrinsic value) Yes, it is used in jewelry and electronics but this is much less of a case for why it is worth so much.
Bitcoin satisfies these criteria:
1. Scarce
3. Borderless
4. (intrinsic value) It's an immutably transparent ledger with pseudonymous transacting capabilities. Used properly, that is an insane amount of intrinsic value.

It does not confirm anything. He is telling someone else not to delete their wallets, not what he did with the first coins mined. If he was motivated to use the coins, he could have quite easily already have done so and made a killing.

I never bought the argument that block stream was inherently a bad idea. Most of These guys were working for the benefit of Bitcoin without support structures for years. It makes sense to me to want to have a group that supports the top developers continue their work without concern for where their next paycheck is coming from or what the price of Bitcoin at any particular time is. I believe block stream fulfills that function and the investors I think would agree. U/nullc has thousands of time locked coins which serve as a mechanism for ensuring the highest long term price and overall health of the network. That is proof enough for me that their intentions are in the right place.

I share your concern about LN being off chain transactions however I am resigned to knowing that this is the only way forward whether we like it or not. LN's use case is micro transactions so I think this is personally acceptable. Do I care that I wont be able to see my coffee purchase 25 years from now on the blockchain? No I dont. Bandwidth is scaling far slower than moores law and there will be tradeoffs if we want to have a legitimate decentralized solution for p2p transactions. My rebuttal to your last point is this: Redundancy. LN will generally speaking not be comprised of smaller nodes connecting to one another. It will be people connecting to extremely large, well connected nodes with massive security and redundancy baked in which then route to another huge well secured node and maybe then one more before it actually connects to the recipient. And most of the transactions that happen there will be micro transactions because you are right no one wants to deal with this level of obfuscation and insecurity for larger amounts. The difference is now that they will have to pay something to send those larger amounts. I am confident that we can keep those fees relatively low.

Not very long ago I thought exactly as you do. However I educated myself on the fact that moores law is slowing down considerably, bandwidth is nowhere near keeping pace and that sybil attacks are actually a serious concern if the node count drops much farther.
I agree - LN is not the solution I want either. As far as I can see however it is either that or give up the dream altogether. We will get micro transactions with negligible cost/ free and settlement for other transactions. This opens the doors back up to the developing world and coffee purchases. It is also rumored that it will happen very very quickly as well. Maybe even as early as April. Talk about a relief if that was actually the case.

You and I both know this is simply not true.

Only for the transactions that you decide you want to route through LN. This is the key difference. Everything else you can route directly (and pay for the privelige of doing so). Additionally, there will be key differences between nodes and their trustworthiness/ fees which differentiate them over time in a significant way. Some will provide anonymity while others will hold onto your data. Costs will vary. Power users will care enough to route their transactions according to their own preferences but generally speaking everyone else will just get super cheap transactions which are automatically routed by smart wallets.

I spoke personally to Jpoon at the silicon valley bitcoin meetup a few weeks ago and he assured me that the code was basically done. The bottleneck on their side is not code but the changes necessary to bitcoin to roll it out. So, once Segwit is done Lightning will be essentially ready to roll out.

How is that circular reasoning? Put another way, if you understand the macroeconomic house of cards currently unfolding and the resulting sociopsychological affect this will have, this is not a stretch. This is simple and clear logic. Yes, a million things will happen in between them, but the ideological shift is what is necessary for this shift to occur... If you want to know the rest of the million things that will happen, you *ahem* can find yourself a youtube video from the mises institute...

Why is it so hard to understand that you forced the community into this position? There is literally no other reason why this would be happening than that. Accept it or don't at this point, it doesn't matter. The community wants to move forward with you, but is obviously not willing to allow you to maintain a monopoly of control over the code any longer. This is something you will have to accept whether you like it or not. Tip for the future: Hire someone to communicate the bigger picture issues to the community if you are unable or unwilling to do that yourself.

I still disagree with that in a very strong way but it does not change the fact that this is all easily explained if you realize that programmers simply suck at communicating and building consensus. and co are also clearly too arrogant to realize there is any benefit to PR to spend a small chunk of the 55 million they just received to even hire someone to deal with that if they can't do it themselves. **That doesn't make what they are working on wrong.

I don't know who said that has happened historically, but I have heard a lot of people say that that is the inevitable outcome. I agree with this assessment as do many in your camp, hence the nastiness we have seen from that side recently (lawyers... really??). The losing side will still have a coin but make no mistake if the hashing power moves... the value of that coin will be demolished. Quickly. The small blockers seem to not care about the value of their coin in USD so if they are happy with it losing 100x in value and still keep working on it, then power to them. I however think it is naive to think that there will be any value left in such a coin...

You're right. I was quite broad with my definition of micro transaction but that is because I think the definition will change over time as does our comfort level with using LN. For the foreseeable future we will only use lightning for routing truly small payments like ad blocking, music streaming, etc but if/ when we run into more serious difficulties scaling then things like coffee and even dinner out will be routed through lightning. By that point I imagine that the network of trusted nodes will be so entrenched that the notion of a node stealing from you will be as absurd as Visa stealing from you (illegally stealing). This will happen because you will know the major nodes and their pluses and minuses (fees vs. data capture) just as well as you know what you like or hate about paypal or visa.

I actually agree with core on this one. There does need to be a need before the blocks get too big. Otherwise it will be continually offloaded onto the main chain slowly killing bitcoin. The problem as I see it is not their solution but their handling of the issue, particularly as it relates to communication and as a result utter failure at setting expectations for major (necessary) economic changes.

The reasons you list above don't have any benefit for using bitcoin over, say cash, especially because we are talking about relatively small amounts.

I'm not demonizing anything, especially technology. You'll see in my first comment that Bitcoin is exactly what we need right now, particularly because people simply equate all money as equal. They do not generally see that the properties of money =/= all money. The consciousness level at present is simply not ready to look at the whole. It's still all about me and mine. That's fine and that's why bitcoin is the best tech for right now. My point was to say that, eventually the consciousness will rise above this and at that point people will voluntarily start using demurrage currencies because they will start putting the whole ahead of themselves.

Something noone is talking about here thus far is the effect of the collapse of major currencies around the world will have on the price of bitcoin. Already we see the price of bitcoin escalating at precisely the time at which the euro is at its melting point. If you trace back the times at which bitcoin has spiked precipitously over the last few weeks, you will notice that it started in the morning european time. Obviously people are getting up, reading about the CF that is the euro and on the next page of Forbes (Jon Matonis), reading about an unhackable, truly international currency, which by the way is also a good investment. This is the factor which will propel bitcoin into triple digits within 2 years.
@_date: 2016-09-27 18:12:34


This is the heart of our disagreement. You see it as poison and I see it as a fundamental part of a properly functioning cryptocurrency. I strongly believe that it is an aspergers-esque fantasy (no offense intended but I lack a better term) to think something which must evolve over time to both scale and defend itself from attacks must somehow be immune to change at the same time. 


This seems a bit of a leap in logic. The actors are all independently deciding - based on the information they accrue, which includes a pool of experts. Where is the centralization?

I think bitcoin is great, exactly what the world needs right now. However, Erik misses completely the point of the spanish speaker who was suggesting a demurrage (negative interest rate).

@_date: 2012-09-17 18:33:31
The bias of infrastructure is baked into finance as opposed to physical infrastructure within a currency system which promotes hoarding (via interest or otherwise). This means that if you have a forest and you want to make money from it, it makes more sense to cut down the entire forest and put the money you made in the bank than to manage that forest sustainably. This is literally what we are doing to the earth (liquidating it) simply due to the properties of our money.

One of the differences between 20th century definitions and 21st will be a one size fits all money (fiat) vs a different money for different things (btc, *,  fiat). We will move to a wider range of currencies because it will make sense to be using different ones because each type of money has its own beneficial properties. Bitcoin is and will continue to be the best (semi) anonymous electronic currency over the internet for the foreseeable future. It will not (and I dont think it should) compete with other currencies for basic staples. For as to why it shouldn't, this is a much longer discussion...

1. To my knowledge there is no current, nor planned protocol
2. This is not a terribly exciting business model for anyone who might be interested in pursuing it (maybe thats why 1 has not been developed) because bitcoins cannot simply be printed in the same way as money can.  Additionally, there is no mechanism to prevent a bank run and as a result, it's not a terribly profitable, nor safe model to pursue with bitcoins.
3. The value bitcoin needs right now, which would be akin to a bank is a safe method of holding &amp; transferring coins (on multiple devices). This is currently (IMO) the largest hole that needs to be filled with respect to the growth of the currency. So, yes there is potential for a bank (ish) entity to provide value within the context of a money with bitcoin's properties. I see a company like blockchain.info or coinbase.com will in the future fill this role rather well (though currently they leave quite a bit to be desired).
@_date: 2012-10-28 17:58:17
Sure there can, but my point is there is no reason to. Litecoin doesnt have any desirable properties that bitcoin is missing. Also, at this point, infrastructure is critical for adoption. Noone is building infrastructure around litecoin and there is a reason for that.
@_date: 2016-09-26 19:32:27




If you are confusing social consensus to be the consensus mechanism that governs bitcoin, then you are incorrectly applying the wrong term.

In a perfect world, we could expect immutability and rely on it (in ethereum), but personally I am fine without in extreme events like the case of the DAO which put the future of POS at risk (the bailout argument while technically true was not the reason it was adopted). We have immutability in bitcoin and that is something to be counted on. Ethereum is a different coin/ chain/ team/ set of possibilities and I am 100% fine with a different set of ethics as well. We don't need the same on both chains. But again, I respect that others do... and they are welcome to exercise their right to voice that with their wallets...

multi sig fixes any personnel problem and the exchange/ computer problem is non existent if you have just 1 competent person on staff or pay 5-10k to someone like Andreas to take care of these things for you. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:00:14
multi sig only works when you have 2 of 3 (or3 of 5 or 4 of 7) consenting to the transaction. So you give the keys to the appropriate people (ceo, coo, custodian as an example) and then when they want to sweep the address, they need at least 2 of those 3 to make the transaction happen. Like i said, 700k is a huge price to pay for learning a pretty straight forward task. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 16:47:43
Multi sig was developed to allow custodians to act as intermediaries for larger groups. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 18:23:03
sure. two examples: the blockchain as a transparent database is potentially affected depending on the implementation. From a PR perspective it also is less than desirable because it would place bitcoin firmly into the money laundering/ crime magnet position. Why add that complication when anonymity is achievable at the end user level?
@_date: 2015-04-29 18:22:26
I really dont understand that as the CEO/COO are supposed to be the ones in charge/ at fault if something does go wrong. As a shareholder of a company that spent 700k because the CEO was paranoid about some unknown event possibly taking place, I would be pretty pissed off. But oh well, it doesnt need to make sense to me. I am not a CEO =)

I think there is a middle ground here where you build your technology around a specific market. I would agree with you that this definitely does have a market. I would also agree with the others however that only including bitcoin as a payment option from the outset will not allow this service to reach its full potential. The market of people looking for wifi spots and bitcoin users is not large enough to for this to take off. As the idea stands, it will get built and then probably languish somewhere because the incentive structure/ marketing won't be solid enough without a company standing behind it to make it take off.


I would rethink this one as well. The tech will always need to be updated onto new systems if you want it to reach its true potential and without a dedicated company supporting it, it might not ever make a dent in the wifi market share. This is a long term play. It is not going to catch on like wildfire immediately. Patience and dedicated work is going to win in this market. There will be plenty of profit for both the wifi spot providers as well as the company if this idea takes off.

Yes, this. Also, bitpay allows you to split the amount you receive in coins, so if you want to do 80/20 or 90/10 for example, thats an option you can specify.

@_date: 2013-01-18 22:17:21
well, the whole point of localbitcoins is to actually meet people in person. This whole verified transactions is a monetization ploy. you bring cash, they bring coins, the end. You should get much better rates than that in person and you will probably make a friend. 
Most people dont care about anonymity (i personally could care less who knows that I am buying a nerd currency), so I would disagree that this will be the reason why it wont take off. Like I said previously, at this early stage in the game, its the wild west and its not as easy as say paypal yet, but someday in the not so far future it will be. And when it is, then people will REALLY be paying for the privilege of using coins.

The biggest disadvantage for those that choose to use this is the volatility inherent in bitcoin. You can use other services like bitreserve.org for consumers or bitpay/ coinbase for merchants to get around this volatility but it is an extra step. However, for those who choose to risk the volatility there is arguably a quite large upside in the months/ years to come.The biggest advantage for the community is [the potential for increased commerce due to a local money]( Bitcoin however does not have a demurrage, so your experiment would essentially be a testing ground for whether it was demurrage or local currency that increases commerce. As said elsewhere I think you need to have an option for physical notes (this in itself will likely be quite complicated) because of the tourists, while for the locals it will likely make more sense to simply use bitcoin wallets on their phones.

Maybe I am misunderstanding something, but as it stands, the issue I see with what you are describing is the willingness of merchants to sign up for your service.

One of the largest holes that need to be filled with bitcoin is safe storage (and lack of insurance). If a big bank were to step up and offer these services, they would have an enormous potential for new customers. Show them [this]( explain to them that its following the logarithmic scale and where the market cap is now (10bln+) and how much of this market share they stand to gain should they step up (a huge amount). They can do the math themselves on whether it makes sense to look into profiting from this platform or not.

Not sure what you mean. Its open source, but the code is developed by a team. The team is only centralized from the perspective that they work together to produce something.

From what I read, those dont really work/ arent terribly reliable and you have to be a super geek to make one of those work. Not so easy to murder someone with one of them either. You only need to be good at being a criminal to buy guns this way off the internet. Not exactly an apples to apples comparison, but I understand the point. My point is that we should be aware of both the benefits and dangers of the increasing anonymity these amazing tools are giving us. And not just fly off the handle screaming "ONOES THEY IS TAKIN MAH LIBERTIES!" even when someone is trying to prevent something terrible from happening. If you want to get a gun and you are not going to murder someone, go to walmart and buy one.

You think the people in the third world will be worse off when bitcoin goes mainstream? How are they worse off than they are now? At least they CAN use bitcoin if they can get a simple phone. Most do not have access to traditional banking tools and they will not have access to them for decades to come. Bitcoin is a godsend to them. Also if you think everyone everywhere in the world will be only using bitcoin you are delusional. At best it will represent 1/10 - 1/4 of the worlds transactional volume. There are those with very good reasons to keep fiat around and they are not simply going to lie down as cryptos eat their lunch.

I would recommend implementing a similar mechanic to what bitcointipbot does here whereby if you provide .01btc for free but it is not used say within 60 days, it will go automatically back to your account.

10%+ take per question? You are not going to get any serious players with that house take. Better strategy would be like .1% to get serious numbers of people and more transactions.

its not losing the coins so much that im afraid of, its malicious software somehow finding its way onto the computer i have it on. qt works great... if you never connect it to the internet.

Not going to touch the government issue - too big for this thread. Re: guns, as said elsewhere: What matters is the effectiveness of the intent to kill. If you want to kill people, can you kill them easily or is it difficult. How many can you kill? Guess where guns fall on that comparison chart. This is what we need to be mindful of.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:26:01
woah i never saw that option before. is there a password prompt when you enter the qr code? if so, i imagine only certain btc clients are able to handle such a setup, no?

That chart is outdated by a few weeks. [Its much higher now]( [Also of interest](
@_date: 2013-01-07 21:34:40
1. Sort by "rate" and you dont need to consider population or landmass.
2. I'm not talking about people not having guns. I'm talking about not ignoring the fact that when you have guns, there are more murders per capita. It's not an easy choice between the possibility of tyranny and more murders.  It's clear which side the USA has chosen and thats fine (though you could go the route of switzerland, which is better IMO). My original point was about increasing the already significant danger from guns due to increasing anonymity.

Guns make it easier for people to kill people. You do not need to be an expert with a gun to kill people with a gun. The same cannot be said about a bomb.

Um, wrong.  Not that it matters however. What matters is the effectiveness of the intent to kill. If you want to kill people, can you kill them easily or is it difficult. How many can you kill? Guess where guns fall on that comparison chart. This is what we need to be mindful of.

Says the tax law. If you are a US citizen, the taxable % on a good applies to the item purchased. I'm not an accountant, so I would love to be wrong, but this is my understanding of the law.
@_date: 2013-01-07 21:35:22
you would, lol. Show me some conflicting data then
@_date: 2013-12-19 18:55:56
So I assume you also made a post about that in etc... right??
@_date: 2013-10-05 07:32:18
Yep, not surprising coming from PBS though.

It takes decades to hundreds of years for paper to fade. this is not a valid concern unless you dont want to cash your coins in until after 2050.
@_date: 2013-01-18 21:38:56
Yep, localbitcoins is the way to go for you then. Most likely, you will end up paying for the anonymity privilege however.

I would not be surprised if we were very near $100 by Thursday/Friday. This week will be insane.

yeah sure it anonymizes what you buy with it, but not the fact that you bought them in the first place.

Mtgox isnt any authority, they are just one exchange. Use bitstamp or cavirtex instead if you want to buy immediately.

Just look at how many times during the latest run up in price people like you have tried to crash it (nearly 50% drop in value on multiple occasions for a short period of time). How did that work out for them?
@_date: 2013-03-25 08:14:51
Right, because gold has the transactional volume to back up its value.
@_date: 2013-03-31 18:25:21
exactly - i was going to say the same thing. Other than that this looks fantastic!
@_date: 2013-02-22 16:55:30
It was about 40% when I bought. Now its over 95%.
