Good book, written in 1841:
Producer. I toil, and others reap the fruits.
Who will show me the real good? To whatsoever point I turn my sorrowing regards, nought but misery, and the prospect of still greater misery do I witness. Whichsoever party gains the victory, we still bear the burdens of society. In Great Britain also, the land from which our statesmen with an apparent consciousness of mental weakness, copy all their precedents and principles of law and government, it is self evident, that with the increase of the means of happiness, the great body of producers have less and less, and if like causes still effect like consequences, so must it be in time with us, when our public lands shall all be occupied. Yea, even now, those who produce the most by genius and industry secure the least, while those who seek not to perform that which is truly useful to society, accumulate the most of all the fruits, of toil and ingenuity.
Turn we to the law for Justice? Even when grossly and directly wronged, there is no hope for us who most require the strong arm of law and government in our behalf-not for the strong but for the weak, was government ostensibly created. But bands of monopolists have corrupted legislators, and if we go to law, the cause may be referred and re-referred, accumulating cost at every stage of progress, until expenses swamp us in despair. No door of justice can be opened by the humble citizen, when once he has been robbed legally by artful men, of that, of which the courts themselves desire to obtain possession-money. Cerberus guards the portals to the courts of justice, falsely so called, and he must have his legal bribe, which we, who have not, cannot give. Should we essay to plead in our own sad behalf, multitudes on multitndes of books beset our path, and we gain nought but ridicule. When rich monopolist raise prices in opposition to the spirit of the laws by their floods of paper, they go free, but when we seek to meed the most unjust depreciation in the value of the money given us as wages, we are sent to prison as conspirators. If we ask our highest learned institutions for a better system of Political Economy, by which we may obtain the means of meeting monied powers on the ground of money, we are told, "let men alone and things will regulate themselves." They send us off, to "Beg a fellow worm to give us leave to toil" 
And dreadful and savage is the thought! The more that we produce, the nearer are we to starvation. When the master manufacturer cannot sell as rapidly as we can make, we are discharged to pine away, until those in better circumstances can waste and wear out the excess of our productions. In Great Britain-the land from which our Political Economy is also borrowed-"bastiles" have been erected, as the only means to cure the crime of poverty. A sight of the green fields is denied unhappy inmates-partners for life are parted-the poor maiden's only ornament, her glossy locks of hair, are closely cropped, as if criminal-her wrist and neck are placed in stocks, while monsters thus despoil the destitute; and all for what? Those in better circumstances cannot consume or waste in riot, as rapidly as he poor companions and herself can produce the means of living happily, and when she ask a pittance from the poor-rates, to prevent direct starvation, she thus suffers for excessive industry.
In the mean time, want increases with the increase of the means of living happily. We become the rivals of soulless insensible machinery. We are told there are too many of us. We are forbidden to look even to affection from some tender partner, as a solace to our misery-I mean we in England, Ireland, France, and elsewhere, for our cause is one over the wide earth. We the producers are the slaves of all governments alike.
In England, those who know not the great difficulties of their lot, complain of corn-laws, tithes, or want of universal suffrage. Others say the great monopoly of land, is the master curse, and others say "let all things be in common, and let there be no accountability to government."
We in America, have no corn-laws, tithes, or hindrance to almost universal suffrage. Land, also is almost as free as air, if we choose to settle in the great territories of the public; but natural evils then arise from isolation, sickness and death may visit us; and none to help be near. We are social beings, and we wish to live together. If we strive to do so, we are rivals to the poor of Europe. They undersell us in our markets, and tens of thousands of us at a time are often destitute. If our shortsighted statesmen seek protection from a tariff, they at the same time issue paper money, and by raising the prices of the raw material, rents, interest of money, and all other things; they thus nullify their work, and even give the foreign manufacture an advantage over our own, and bring the nation annually in debt 463,682,530 on an average, as our domestic enemies acknowledge when hard pressed, and for which our most available stocks and property are now mortgaged:-so short-sighted are our elected representatives. This has been the case for years, and those who first proposed the remedy **(a reformation of the banking system,)** when the union was shaken to it's centre, by the danger of a civil war between the North and South; have had exhausted on them every epithet that low imaginations could devise.
Fashions which worship crosses, stars and garters, which are given to such as ravage and destroy, with fire and sword, the territories of the peaceful husbandman and civil citizen, have been brought to bear against us. The great banker, like the robber by the sword, men consider good society, while the honest man of value to his fellow men, is held as base, ignoble, vulgar, and looked down upon with scorn. Honest industry being thus despised, we are too generally led to seek to overreach by plausible pretences, rather than live by juster means; and virtue, suffering persecution, flees from earth. In despair, I ask again-Who can show me what is truly good? What seems at first view to be good, is evil in it's consequences, and what at first seems evil, and is undesired, is in the end superior to that which we most ardently desired as good. Ah me! What can I and my class do? We are beasts of burdens grievious to be borne, while they will not move a little finger" in our favor. I turn to them and turn away, and back to them again, since they make most pretensions of good-will to man, but it is all a show. They too are striving to escape that hydra, want and seek the glory of the world, **and dare not speak against the great accumulator.** In view of all we thus behold, does not the dreadful thought come home to our understandings, that there is no God of justice to order things aright on earth; or if there be a God, he is malicious and revengeful being, who created us for misery.
If so, why toil for happiness. Who, I cry again, in deep despair, can show me real good?
Author: I can.

If you look up sacred geometry or gann, you will find this type of stuff. Price likes to follow certain price/time relationships or angles, and thus price follows a mathematical harmony, it's a strange phenomenon, but it works.

Who buys all the top mathematicians out of the top schools?
Virtually everything is done with intent. On a large scale, it's easy to manipulate all markets say if you controlled inflation/interest rates. Have a couple of politicians in your pocket? Own a news corporation? Now you're making laws, now you can plan "ahead" and steer the country whichever direction you want.
