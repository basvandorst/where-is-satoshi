Looks civilized and voluntary.
Good to see.

That wouldn’t be worse than our current ledger-free “print it whenever you need it” system.
One day, our children and grandchildren will say to us, “You guys had computers and the internet for HOW MANY years while the government could just PRINT MONEY whenever they wanted to?”
And our answers will be different variations of, “Yes.  We kinda just let the government do whatever the hell it wanted to...  Yep...  That’s all I’ve got to say about that.”

I think that there will be an abrupt increase in BTC trade volume again after people start losing interest in alt coins.
Personally, I have faith in BTC’s long term longevity, but I have taken interest in a few alt coins and eventually decided to invest very heavily into one of them that I think has more short-term growth potential than BTC.
Also, I’m guessing it’s difficult for the “layman” to keep up with software terminology hot-words they don’t understand (hard forks, “lightning”, segwi, etc.) and speculations surrounding regulation.
So, as it becomes easier for more people to invest, and as the vision of “one coin to rule them all” becomes more plausible and realistic over time and software/price/efficiency improvements (perhaps after all of the miners can focus on transactions instead of mining?), then I think BTC will get more of the attention I think it deserves.
It wouldn’t surprise me to see BTC hit $100k by the end of the year — but I think that my own alt coin investments are much more likely to grow at a faster rate before I eventually choose to RE-invest those earnings back into BTC.

Dude lets his friend recklessly invest $3k using his own phone...
Sounds about right for a dude eating a bowl of pinecones with a small spoon.  Stranger things have happened...

It’s never too late to start investing.
As long as you understand the long term potential of your investment and the volatility of the market, you just need to set some short term goals and some long term goals to plan your success.
Whatever you decide to invest in, do your best to fully educate yourself as much as you can.
I would start with researching the blockchain technology behind bitcoin, and bitcoin’s relations to gold.  Good luck!

Are you talking about [this article]( where $300 Million in Ether was accidentally destroyed?
Edit:  Based on when the article was written, the amount accidentally destroyed back then would be worth $750 Million now!

Is it just me, or does the guy look constipated???
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:23:17
Exactly!  I still have no answers to what the hell is going on except for the short popup I saw.
@_date: 2018-08-03 16:02:10
I’m looking at SEVERAL charts that don’t make sense with each other, when they all usually have MATCHING information.
And where the hell did the  chain come from out of nowhere???  And now, by the time of typing this, VeChain is no longer on Coin Market Cap at all....
Never mind I just saw a popup about BitForex API error or something...
A lot just happened all in a short time, but I took several screenshots / screen grabs...

There was some bug with Tether and CoinMarketCap.  It’s been resolved.  ��

The microchip has only been around for about 70 of those years, C Programming for less than 50 of those years, Internet 2.0 for less than 20 of those years, and Internet 3.0 being created now.
Automation 250+ years ago is virtually nothing in comparison to automation today — and automation today will probably be overshadowed (even more than either of us could imagine) by automation 10 years from now.

I’m definitely NOT the biggest fan of our legal system in the U.S. — but as [life-enhancing technology]( continues to improve, sentencing terminology will definitely have to evolve, too (or become obsolete).

Thank you for this answer.  It wasn’t until I read a reply from another thread that I realized how much better yours was/is.

I would think of quantum computing as a way of ENHANCING everything that already exists (but replacing very little of it).
@_date: 2018-02-18 18:24:05
I have faith (and actual investments) in Bitcoin.  I was just trying to gain a better understanding of the security behind it, and I have from the information in this thread, as well as the info posted in this [other thread](
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:36:30
Do the fears of quantum computing stem from the basic general idea that, “it’s usually easier to break something than it is to fix it?”
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:27:11
If quantum computing had ANY negative effect on Bitcoin, why wouldn’t it be able to have an equal-and-opposite (or MORE significant) impact on Bitcoin in its favor?

You sound very intelligent comparing nuclear weapons to a technology that WILL have more purposes than you could ever count.
Thanks for that.  It’s clear that you must often value your anonymity.
Thankfully, someone answered this question more tactfully and more intelligently [here](

Edit:  The conclusion I came to after listening, is that although the idea might seem useful in THEORY, it is simply unnecessary in reality.

The second-to-last frame was the BEST one, IMO.

Thank you for sharing that, u/MrPMorris.

Thanks for everything you’ve posted here.  In regards to myself posting about my own “metrics” on education and how I see the world, it was more from the approach that “the MORE I know, the more I know I DON’T know” — but I realize that I didn’t articulate myself as well as I could have, and that there’s always a wide margin of perception when it comes to written words.
Seriously, though — I really appreciate the time you took to contribute to this thread, and I hope (and trust) that others besides me have already greatly benefitted from the content in it at this point (let alone any future contributions to such a young thread).

Currencies regulated by men lost my trust a LONG time ago; with Bitcoin and others, we just FINALLY have viable alternatives acknowledged on magnitudes too large to be reversed.
Edit:  After being downvoted, I re-worded myself for anyone who insists there’s only “one coin to rule them all, and in the darkness bind them.”

Thank you for the insights and recommended reading.
In a few minutes, I will begin looking into “Mastering Bitcoin”, but at this exact moment, I’m wondering what kinds of minds will be behind the continued developments of cryptocurrencies within the upcoming world of quantum computing.  Basically, there will certainly be a conglomerate portion of development consisting of experienced software programmers, but I wonder what portion of development will be discovered by more “nontraditional” types and influencers.
Now that I think about this, I have a friend who graduated with a Bachelor’s in Philosophy who happens to be a significant part of a software development team, and I want to pick his brain about his various involvements with computer programmers in his career.
As far as myself, I have a Bachelor’s of Applied Science in Nuclear Engineering Technology (from TESU), and real-world experience working with nuclear reactors, spectrometers, diffractometers, helicopters, various military ground vehicles, and now I work as a musician.  So — it’s very safe to conclude that I see the world through a different “lens” than the “average” person, and I’m far more intrigued by Bitcoin technologies that are currently over my head than intimidated by them.
TL/DR:  It would be nice to have a place with condensed information about Bitcoin PAIRED with “layman’s” data (so that more people like myself with limited programming experience can process the information easier, or perhaps even contribute to the cause), but the existing truth is that people who are curious about it (like myself) will at least search to SOME extent to gain a better understanding through existing means.  Thanks for sharing your thoughts!

This video was absolutely AMAZING, and EXACTLY what I needed to see in regards to computational curiosities and possibilities regarding Bitcoin (an existing technology that is not even “mostly understood” by one percent of the population, I’m guessing), and quantum computing (mostly an upcoming technology that is probably “mostly understood” by one tenth of the people who “mostly understand” Bitcoin).

He’s talking about TRADING, not necessarily “investing”.  They are related, but NOT the same.  Bull markets are good for trading because you “make some, or make more”.  In bear markets (like now), you “make some or lose some”.

I wish I could upvote you twice for such a DIRECT and CONCISE explanation, given the circumstances.  Well said.

Who do you pity more:  the person taking a few seconds of their day to support this idea (whether they think it is simple or profound), or the person taking much MORE time to outwardly express their obvious negativity?

Confidence should only be on par with understanding — otherwise it’s just being lucky or unlucky.
If you were a Venezuelan a year ago, would you have felt more confident that it wouldn’t snow the next day, or more confident that your country’s currency wouldn’t collapse?
@_date: 2019-05-01 18:56:13
Confidence will also vary based on how much research is necessary, how much research is done, and the individual’s unique perspectives on “long-term”, “short-term”, and “risk”.
