No, it doesn't.  
Independent of anything Tether/Bitfinex might do, the exchanges have a financial incentive to list USDT, or any other stablecoin, if they are not able to list fiat.    
A stablecoin provides liquidity, reassurance for the customers, and much easier arbitrage.  
It also allows them to skirt banking regulations.  
Almost all the highest volume exchanges, which they get comissions off of, list USDT.

I don't know, but my transactions from 2013, which is when I made my first purchase on Coinbase still shows up.   
My first transaction on GDAX still appears as well.  
It can all be downloaded/exported.

For more info, look at the spreadsheet linked at the bottom of the post that I made.   


    
Tether issues them at will from their issuing address.     
In theory, they do so when they received a USD deposit or from transferring it from their own balance.      


      
Originally it was called Realcoin and rebranded to Tether.
I haven't researched the creators of Realcoin.   


        
27 exchanges. They are listed on the Exchanges sheet.

Market cap is not the amount of money.     
If the price of a crypto with 10 million supply increased by $1, then $10 milllion is added to the market cap.    
If it costs $100,000 to raise it by $1, then $100,000 was spent to increase the market cap by $10 million.     
That's 100x effect of money on the market cap.        
When USDT is treated the same as USD, the same applies to USDT.

Indeed, which is why I posted it was circumstantial and simplified, as well being an overview.     
Tether Report is linked for statistical analysis.   
As for the most fine-grained of detailed analysis, I don't know if we'll see that anytime soon.  
I think it would be very difficult to conclusively prove anything.
