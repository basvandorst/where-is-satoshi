If I moved held btc on an Electrum wallet during the time of the fork but moved it to a hardware wallet is there still bch in my Electrum wallet?
@_date: 2017-08-03 08:09:01
So bch is still in my Electrum wallet, but there is no btc in the Electrum wallet, how do I retrieve ? I only see it through blockchair

I don’t see it on my app and no upgrade available ��

Never thought about it like that. But when I buy via btc is that something I have to consider when tax time comes?

If it’s too good to be true, it’s probably to good to be true. Don’t fall for it, I don’t know how it works, but that sounds to sketchy.

If you’re lazy for Coinbase pro cause of the long wait use cash app, better rates than Coinbase app.

That’s why I can’t pull the trigger to upgrade to the nano x. Btc will rise and I will feel that I spent too much. Probably best to just use fiat.

Is there a way to view your electrum wallet on an iPhone, to know your balances etc.? And what is the best way to control your private key? Save the CSV file?

I had this same issue click on the cash support button&gt; something else&gt; bitcoin&gt; withdraw bitcoin&gt; select a recent transaction.
They will contact you and you have to send them in the ID picture front and back (all four corners must be shown) and a selfie of yourself. They told me they had issues with the verification process via app.
Hope this helps
