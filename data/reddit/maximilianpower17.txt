Probably because finex is a ponzi. The thing that sealed it was how their Baghdad bob Chris Ellis is bragging about lending rates. Do you think polo is reasonably trustworthy? If so, why? You seem knowledgeable.

Chris ellis is a member of the world crypto network. Mt Finex hired him as spokesman. WCN is a group of scammers with their own YouTube channel. Just today wcn scammer jimmy song said ant bleed was not malicious lol(he's paid by Chinese miners) This excludes tone vays who is honest.

The comment that made me realize it's a huge scam was how Mr Chris Ellis was advertising : we are offering a huge premium for lending bitcoin on bifenix. Setting a trap for more people. When befinix collapses what does this do to the bitcoin price??

Oh no!!! Someone warn queen Ver! Price goes up whenever our shitty nodes designed by a firecracker salesman princess  crash

Do you think lending on polo is safe???
@_date: 2017-04-29 03:25:52

That's exactly why ted bundy was so successful at murdering women. They immediately trusted his smile.
