This about the only rational crypto sub that doesn’t feel like a bunch of hopeful moonbois. However, it will be less rational as soon as we enter a solid bull run.

I mean.. that *should* make sense but don’t count yer chickens before they hatch ��

Oh.. duh. My bad. It’s absolutely an awesome community and sub.

Checking in from the Free State Blockchain conference in Portsmouth NH. Such an awesome community! It’s a breath of fresh air. There are also several places here you can actually spend Bitcoin on every day products and services. It’s happening, just not overnight. Hang in there people!

Pied Piper Coin ��

I think so. It *seems* like there is a lot of money on the sidelines waiting to make sure we have bottomed out.

Buy Bitcoin anyway. In a year you can buy many furniture!!!

Do you also flog yourself?

That’s a pretty bold claim to say they were competing with the Cartel in the drug game.

Well.. they are lying but your theory is correct.

BCash or real Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-02-03 19:41:34
Is LTC going to be super relevant again soon? There’s a plot twist.
@_date: 2018-11-04 23:42:04
Circle bought it.
