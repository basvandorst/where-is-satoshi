Following council approval, the second Canadian municipality is set to accept Bitcoin property tax payment in partnership with Toronto-based fintech and blockchain solutions company, Coinberry.
This is a huge step forward for Bitcoin in Canada, following the success of Coinberry's partnership with the Town of Innisfil. It is believed that the continued adoption of Bitcoin as a means of payment will create a domino effect of government councils adopting it into the mainstream!

Hi u/that_amazon_guy, I'm sorry to hear you're experiencing issues with the platform. At present, we're experiencing high traffic, and processes may be slowed as a result. Thank you for emailing out support team - if you haven't already, please file a ticket at [ so we can address this ASAP. 48 hours for deposit time is highly unusual, so we will investigate this to identify why your deposit was not processed despite the email confirmation. Rest assured, if the funds have been sent, then they will be deposited to your account. Our apologies for this delay.
Could you please also provide some greater detail to our support team on your attempted website login yesterday (Browser, OS, Time)? Our Devs will take a look at any site issues.
Thank you u/that_amazon_guy for using Coinberry - we're going to get you back to trading as soon as possible.

Yes, I recommend opening a ticket, and in the Message field you can refer to your earlier email. The support email is best suited to assisting with general queries or assistance regarding the service, but if you are experiencing an issue that requires attention, it is best to file a ticket which may then be marked completed once your issue is resolved.
Looking forward to your feedback on our website, so we may address any similar instances, as this is uncommon. (Please share this feedback through our support channels, so as to avoid sharing any identifiable information on a public platform such as this). Thank you!

Hi u/Ceelic, Coinberry here. We operate under a broker model, meaning we have various Exchanges, OTC desks and Crypto Miners that we source liquidity from. 
In general, a number of reasons can cause the price to be different on Coinberry and various price composites, most notably the foreign exchange used to achieve the Canadian crypto price. Also, price composites fall short on the "investable index" test, as they cannot be purchased (it's only a reference rate).
Hope that helps, feel free to reach out to us at [support if you have any other questions.

It's truly unfortunate what happened with Quadriga. They were a big part of the Canadian crypto space. A lot of our team members purchased their first bitcoin there too. If there is anything our team can do for this community, please let us know.

Thanks for chiming in! Great to see that you're paying attention to the space. We've recently updated our algorithms and this has greatly improved the rates. Would love to hear your thoughts on the update!
