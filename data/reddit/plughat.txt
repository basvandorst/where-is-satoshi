Yes, you shouldn't trust 3rd parties... This is the whole point of BTC. In the mean time, Buying and transferring out immediately is fine with me. There's alternatives if you don't trust these companies..  , mycelium wallet. I'm sure there's more decentralized marketplaces and many more coming.

Your arguments are circular, just go eat your own ass(Ouroboros)... Dodges questions, misdirection, repeating unsubstantiated doubt, not thinking for yourself... Sounds like we have a troll, enjoy your last word. I'm done and ready to buy more ;)
