What do you mean no support on chrome? I just used it this morning.

Thank you for posting it. Watching the dip, this brought me peace. I do wish we would find solution faster and push harder, but it is a monumental task.

Sorry. We were told since it was fished, no coverage. I moved to gemini.

If mine wasn’t on in a ledger at home I’d send it now... just because they rock.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:53:44
I disagree with this:
Do you want your Bitcoin to go up 500%?
Gains will come as adoption increases and wealth comes in. And that only happens when the thing WORKS. Right now, not only are the fees and scaling a major issue, overall usability is. This isn't an idiot friendly eco-system, but there are many normal people with a lot of money that could use, would use, and sometimes may NEED BTC. Until it's made simple, secure, and friendly, it can't succeed. If we want 40k next year and 100k the year after we need to be addressing these pain points. The price only moves up if more people see value in it.
EDIT: to clarify, I understand this is why it's not 100k already. But I also don't believe that's the only reason. And I think it's important that the community focus on those pain points to grow further before we are eaten alive by the alt coins. Remember typically the first big innovator to market dies off and is overtaken by the competition not afraid to handle these issue head on. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:41:14
I agree.... but I also must say they aren’t wrong. I do think this is bad for btc. But I do think it’s creeping up a lot right now.
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:53:27
Shoulda just bought bitcoin with it..:
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:32:49
It has been working great as a store of value. And I hope it continues to do so. But I'd also love to see the move to mBTC and I'd love to see us using it instead of hoarding it. If it turns out to be gold 2.0 and that's it's niche, great. But it would be really cool to trade little nuggets of BTC with each other for other things we need\want.

@_date: 2017-12-15 01:45:24
Agreed. And good advice. But we should also encourage and inspire other nerds that aren’t the core nerds that can do amazing things and build great tools for this ecosystem. I do get the “waiting until we get it 100% right mentality” though. And I appreciate that.

Email. A couple weeks ago. It took 2ish weeks. There is another person in this thread that posted the form letter
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:07:07
I’m not sure that’s the proper framing of this. Keep in mind, we fell for a scam. We weren’t brute force hacked or anything. This isn’t JP Morgan. This isn’t to sound uncaring, but I think we will be lucky if we see those funds again. That doesn’t mean we shouldn’t talk until resolve. But idk if they protect against this kind of theft. We’ll have to see. But couple that with record traffic... idk.

I don’t really do the git thing... so here is my 2 Satoshi
First, this is great. So thank you. Because really, this is what btc needs to grow.
1.	I would recommend 2-factor for sending coins out. Prevents hyjacking. Make it easy to use. 
2.	 I would recommend and encrypted cloud recovery option. Most people won’t even know how to store a seed. But they could enter a password when something comes back down from the cloud. It’ll be tough, but I think it’s needed.
3.	 make it able to send and receive qr codes a number of ways.
4.	if you can make it work with hardware options, people will trust it more. Hard to do for mobile, but if you’re going to offer desktop, that would be great.
5.	 don’t make segwit a choice.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:14:49
Did you check the transaction? Low fee may have it locked up. I have one like that right now
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:52:29
Very fair. It’s why I got on cb’s twitter today to say exactly that. But I don’t think it’s fair to spin that concept to a positive for why “we are still early and massive gains will come”. Admit we have a problem, push for solution, encourage companies that participate or to participate, and further adoption. Raise all ships, not just our own. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:06:06

Giving my girlfriends little brother $50 usd as btc for Christmas. It’s on a paper wallet. I did it at 10k to celebrate... so the kids already up pretty well. I’m excited for him!
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:32:24
I hope you do. I really do. But the wording and mentality is dangerous to the community. I hope the refund is because it’s a drop in the bucket and they have insurance to deal with it etc. in the end, I admit fault.
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:33:55
We should strive to encourage this to become the best tool it can be and not just another elite thing. We have enough elite stuff in the world.

As some one very new to the community, thank you for supporting an icon. He has taught us all so much and brought us so far (and I would assume you as well). It’s absolutely astounding. I wish I knew who you were because I’d certainly love the bounty. But in the end, even if we don’t know your name, we’ll remember your generosity. These are crazy times and it’s nice to see the beacons light.
In other news, what flavor of ice cream do you recommend he get first?
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:31:13
Absolutely there is a point. The point is that we should be encouraging the community to develop not just for the community, but for the world. We shouldn't just educate people about securing, we should make tools that facilitate securing.  That's it's not enough to hope to educate people up to our level. Rather, we should try to create tools that make it easier at all levels.
I tell people all about my Nano S. I would have never hopped in fully without it. Because I don't really know how to make a paper wallet... I don't really need\want to know. This was a tool that made securing my coin easy and familiar and helped me climb up a little higher in comfort. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:55:29

I think it was “Gdax” and I think it was the top/ad honestly. It was in the corner of my eye.... so I missed it.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:28:01
I'm a little too new to have a good answer for that. And a little too American. But I'll tell you GDax is owned by CB and is cheaper in every way. But it's not as simple. So, if you can, at least move to GDax. But I don't know if there is another exchange that's better. I too would like to know.
@_date: 2017-11-26 11:40:36
If you don’t mind me asking, how did you end up there? I tried to retrace our steps and I think she just put Gdax in the search bar and clicked the first link. I had to go back through the browser history to figure it all out. Hence why I said I should have been watching closer.
Issues like this I believe are what keep people away from the market space. Even though is isn’t the markets issue, it happens and it’s scary.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:59:35
Yea. The issues is "a trustless ecosystem". Someone has to be trusted. So, my hope is that we can build a trust approval system where anyone can recommend a site, but only a few can approve and moderate the chain. But IDK, infant idea.

Ledger Nano S does BTC, Litecoin, ETH, and a slew of others. They are currently working on support for Monero. I also just got a little Ark and it works with that. Trezor is also a good option, but Ledger seem to me the way to go. But yea, I wanted one device that held everything and was easily recoverable.

First, I am so sorry for your loss. She only put in $1000 and I actually gave her a piece off mine since I should have realized what was happening (and I appreciate her being along for the ride). 
No, nothing yet. And their number was not taking calls. I, like you, totally agree that if they had better contact, maybe they could stop it. But I will say.
1.	Cancel the cards.
2.	change your email pass and coinbase pass
3.	wait
4.	Call them first thing Monday
5.	report the site on google
I don’t think there will be anything to be done here. I now hope to save others the same fate.

This. Been thinking about it a lot lately. Even my gf got robbed of $1k. It’s easy to fall for.

Setting up a node and downloading the block chain now. It’s pretty slow. But my question, if it is so vital and we all champion the nodes and appreciate their service, why do so few people do it? I bought in two weeks ago after watching you for years and I have made it a priority to set one up. The number being around 8k, I don’t understand.
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:22:18
Basically this. I look back to when I wanted to buy a knc miner and think “you idiot, you should have just dumped that money on the coins and you’d be done”. But most sold early. My buddy had over 300 at a point, sold early when it hit $1000. Bought back in recently and now we’re both starting the journey.  Me just this month. But this night...

@_date: 2017-11-24 20:25:27
Hardware wallet. I didn’t invest big until I had one. Ledger nano s on sale today. It is a hardware piece that stores your seeds (essentially you on the chain) and is fully recoverable. Best part, can’t move coins without having it once set up. So, if someone wants to take your coin, they need to have it, know your passcode, and know how to work it. Or make a swift Java applet you unsuspectingly install as malware. But that’s why you always check the send address you copied and pasted.... because you’re smart :p
Love my ledger. Wear it every day at without fear. Starts conversations and I like some of my savings around my neck. My friends call it my Jew Gold...

I may not understand what a full node is the , being new. I seek no advantage, but to widen and increase our network and serve the community in what little capacity I can. I have an always on Plex server.... so giving a little cpu power and space to help others is good by me. 
Is this not what will happen? If I open the port, what happens then? I have some digging to do.

May be a tough life lesson.... but I won’t quit/be mad till they stop talking. Right now, we were told 2-3 days, I’m gonna give it.

My buying of dip caused additional dip. So I bought another mainstream crypto as well for fun... which then dipped.
I AM THE DIP

Really digging the Cash app for purchases. Reasonable averaging, no fee, fastish transfers out.

Not enough to retire on. Yet
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:46:05
What you mean?
@_date: 2018-07-03 11:48:05
Better go buy it now
@_date: 2018-07-23 21:25:09
When btc hits $150k a coin I probably still won’t care how much money Jeff has.

Looks like someone has been trading while listening to the new tool record.

But will it be used for good?
Or EVIL
@_date: 2018-07-25 19:40:54
Could you get someone to sponsor it or something? Maybe talk to ledger and see if they would be willing to give the 1 mil sub a nano? Or one of the other amazing companies chip up and give one of the laser engraved wallets? Just a cool little something for the 1 mil mark.
And memes... all the memes.

How many dollars will it take for me to get back to 2009 with at least $5 left?
@_date: 2018-07-26 10:31:24
I mean, I would consider donating a lambo hotwheels and a physical Bitcoin. Does that count? 
@_date: 2018-07-02 21:47:57
I don't disagree. But I'll make a bet right now that, if left unpurchased, that attack is coming... and I'd wager 10's of thousands lost.

Lol. Still gotta fight the bum... drone or no
@_date: 2018-04-03 20:39:03
Dude has seen black mirror... you’re gonna fight someone in front of a drone!

Working well so far. I don’t see a way to receive in lightning, just send. Is that intentional? Or is that coming to the app?
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:09:30
Any idea how to make it persistent on reboot?
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:13:28
Thank you, that helps! Are there a few nodes though that have a lot of paths? Once I added one in zap the recommended went away.
@_date: 2018-12-04 11:27:00
Totally agree. Btc probably isn’t getting ya off this rock in reality. But maybe it’ll cross boarders enough that it can participate.
@_date: 2018-12-21 14:13:14
Can anyone recommend some nodes to connect to on mainnet? I connected to Satoishi's place, but I still couldn't send\\receive (I think there was no clear route). I'd love to be able to start using it.
@_date: 2018-12-04 11:21:06
Wow, thank you! I didn’t know the tipping thing was still a thing around here! I appreciate it!!!
@_date: 2018-12-04 12:42:40
Where else would I store it? Lol
Kidding. Ledger nano for the win!
@_date: 2018-12-08 02:43:47
What I mean is why not a pi?
@_date: 2018-12-04 21:20:37
Don’t get me wrong, I wanna be rich. But I also wanna see this tech proliferate. 
@_date: 2019-05-25 10:28:35
With all the recent hacks and oddnesses, I wouldn’t recommend electrum to someone wanting “user friendly”. Seems a good way to get someone hacked.

My ledger says I still have control of 100% of my limited btc &lt;3
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:48:42
May I ask a question? Sorry if this is ignorant. Does a lightning node have to stay online all the time to function for its wallet? For instance, once a channel is established, can a or both machines go offline and the channel still work, be used, etc?
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:54:08
Part of what I’m getting at. We have a really cool backend. Now we need to make it approachable.
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:12:32
I'm.still not understanding the why here. I have an always on server for media and just installed a VM, core, and LN. With Windows it took no time. Why this over a pi?
@_date: 2018-12-07 22:19:11
Someone showed me this a couple days ago. Maybe it would help you as well?
@_date: 2013-08-26 20:11:57
I love this option and was just about to jump into it as well. Sadly, I'm not set up for btc yet. Was waiting on my miner to show to really jump in. I've purchased a Mercury from KNC. If it shows in Oct, then I'm hoping good things. But obviously, it looks like time is a factor.
@_date: 2013-08-26 16:03:14
That's my hope as well. I cancelled BFL since they are really outpaced by others. But I have another one on order. Let's hope!
