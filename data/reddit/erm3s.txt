The words are used to extract a cryptographic key, but not any words, only those listed in a specific list called BIP39, in this list \(English\) there are 2048, but in the puzzle in question, there are at least 86 words, in combinations 24 word are many, thank goodness here we have fun in "GPS mode on".  :\-\)

No letter, symbol, curves and straight line are there by random, the specific position of a single point is predictable, despite everything seems scattered. This is enough for me to say that there is only one possibility of chaos, the only random thing are our choices, go for new roads is like discovering new words, you could predict words that fade on straight lines, corners and curves, with more or less speed depending on its orientation for end in a sentence that seems logical to us, the image will understand your effort and will measure your confidence and will indicate your path step by step.
I just wanted to share this reflection. Good luck \&lt;=\&gt; Good choices.

I myself was the one who banned myself, I had fulfilled my "mission". That is, try to share what little I know to leave people in parity. Go!
Bye, work in progress!

Hi, I'm sorry if I intrude, but it's not a traditional treasure hunt, here we must find a group of words that reveal a key to open a cryptic lock, sorry but there is no gold under the rainbow.

In light of what I told you, you could continue to effort yourself.
It can be very frustrating, try to keep your daily life. 
We await both u/cryptogreet to give his clues, it could also be useful to me.

I think most of the people are not here for pure fun, who knows with this image people can have more clarity. I hope I do not break any regulations, I would just like to put my hand into those bits.

In the most difficult moments, take a break, but do not give up. After a few steps, the image itself talks about what you need to do to continue. She will tell you the path to follow. We had a short conversation, with you it will be less timid.
Trust and effort.

I am trying in every way, I have come to the point of understanding that it is a "treasure map" to find a block and a specific transaction starting from May 2011 and enter the credentials (24 words) containing in the puzzle to recover the loot, I mean, all words have a complex sense, form sentences. My indication is to use Google translator app and reading the image through "OCR" will get better than me who are not English-speaking. If I've been helpful.
Thank you.

The image itself shows us the measure of a line, see the opposition between the symbol of the lambda calculation, the eleventh letter of the Greek alphabet \(lambda\) and the ipsilon of our alphabetum. The image is also saying "see". That line is the height of the rectangle to be constructed, it will not be difficult to find the base of the rectangle.

You will not find spirals, but the spirals will be your tools.

Hello friends of the Milky Way, I'm coming. From the tail running away towards the infinite. Far away, so close. Do not think it's impossible, with the tools to work you can extract words of gold.
For exemple:
code else still two course speed else end open system level reveal
Ps. But we must think in pairs.

It does not mean much, but that sentence of first posted by me with BIP49 comes out a 37XTs, so I think that is the right way...m/49'/ 0'/0'/ 0/7603, I know, still very far but it's just an indicative passphrase.

"Philosophy [nature] is written in that great book which ever is before our eyes -- I mean the universe -- but we cannot understand it if we do not first learn the language and grasp the symbols in which it is written. The book is written in mathematical language, and the symbols are triangles, circles and other geometrical figures, without whose help it is impossible to comprehend a single word of it; without which one wanders in vain through a dark labyrinth."

Know all that what you see in the middle of the image is not a pentagram or  hexagram, it's his beautiful eyes =\&gt; ,  an intersection of harmonic rectangles.  See the star because you are very far and do not understand the subtleties of the form.

exactly, I immediately understood the spiral, try using android app google translate image OCR, you can read the sentences, but it would be laborious to turn the drawing and assemble the puzzle every time

That image concerns the search for the solution of the puzzle with a practical sense and is the approach that I have adopted, I hope my thesis can be confirmed when the 12 or 24 words will be revived, but it can also be the solution will come from a Lara Croft approach that I see many are adopting.
With a spiral you can easily sort the words and read very interesting phrases, following the path formed by the numbers from 0 to 12 \(\-1\) present in the image, I mean, I suppose that the solution hides along the straight lines and curves of the golden rectangle , but I do not understand where to find the "X", but the absence of "technical" information makes the game not fun for me, that is, it is not enough to find words, we must also know if 12 or 24 if bip49 or bip141 and other things quite technical.
Testing the solution here every time \&gt;\&gt;\&gt; [
I also made artistic deviations when I had already abandoned the search for the enigma. =\&gt; [

I have no more motivation to go on, I stop here. All the best.

Because that area takes up most of the enigmatic clues, this was for me the most scientific approach.
