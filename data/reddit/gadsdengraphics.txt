Yeah, the details of how to architect a secure system like this are beyond my motivation right now to develop, but to keep everything in one wallet isn't really an option. Printed, physical private keys are also an obvious requirement for this sort of thing IMO.
I suspect the right answer is to look at how companies do this now. I'm sure that no one person is responsible for all the keys to the kingdom at a major corporation, so they could just walk into a bank and get cash. There must be financial controls in place, and those would likely have analogues in a Bitcoin economy.

On private property, it absolutely is. To say otherwise is to assert ownership over the property of another.
I completely disagree with the concept of discrimination based on race - or for that matter, discrimination in business, period. It's ignorant and counter-productive. That does not give me the right to go on someone else's property and tell them what they can and cannot do with the things that they've earned - it only gives me the right to tell them that they're ignorant and counter-productive.

Gee - "legal" implies a legal system, and "PAC" is a common acronym for a "political action committee", which is an organization mandated by the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971.. in the United States.
Since by convention, PACs are American entities, and American entities are governed by US law, it is reasonable to believe that an actual Reddit PAC would be governed by US law.
Someone who is not a US citizen is not going to be concerned about the legality of their political contributions under US law, as it does not apply to them - hence, I surmised that gvsteve is an American citizen.
As you can see, my comment was directed at gvsteve, who I reasonably believe to be an American citizen. "this country", in this contect, refers to our mutual nation, the United States of America.

Gold isn't backed by anything of tangible value, really.
There are industrial uses, and jewelry, but that wouldn't support a fraction of its current value. Its market value is a function of the fact that it's a relatively fixed supply, easily authentication, somewhat easily transported, etc.
Bitcoin has very similar properties, but different in some key areas.
Gold, as an investment, is not significantly more certain that Bitcoin. It's just been around longer and has a more liquid market.

Negative - the private keys need to be stored offsite. A deterministic system might be ideal for this, if only one person maintained the seed in their own mind, and didn't back it up in such a way the government could obtain it.
One could run a service that allowed for transactions via API, where the facility could not under any circumstances access the funds directly.
The service could be run offshore, with a clause that if the facility is raided, the funds become permanently inaccessible to the business and the third party could pay creditors and such directly. Remaining balance could be claimed in person, mailed to an undisclosed location in gold, fiat currency, or boxes of Tide laundry detergent -  or donated to a charity (say, NORML?) - there would be no way for the government to know which option was chosen, and therefore no way to prove that the funds are still available for withdrawal under any circumstances.

@_date: 2012-03-19 22:54:41
Yes and no.
There are laws against possession by felons, person with domestic violence convictions, and a couple of other criteria. A seller may not sell to someone who they know is a prohibited person.
That said, there is no requirement for a seller to find out if the buyer is legal. If a felon buys a gun from a stranger, the seller committed no crime unless it can be demonstrated that he knew the buyer was a felon. I regularly buy and sell guns for cash, without even knowing the seller's name. That's completely legal from a federal standpoint, and legal in the great majority of states.
Gun restrictions in the US are usually in the form of where and how you can carry them outside the home - but there are 5 or 6 states now with *no* requirements to carry, concealed or open. The other side of that would be states like Illinois, where all guns must effectively be registered with the state and you need permission to buy one legally. I would be willing to wager an arbitrary amount that the majority of the firearms in those states are possessed illegally, even by those who are otherwise law-abiding citizens.
By and large, Americans despise government control, and guns are a big part of our culture. Obviously, there is quite a bit of variation in a country of 300 million people, so this is a great generalization.

Greed _is_ the financial system.
Regulations attempt to prevent bad things from happening by centralizing power. Once that power is centralized, the entity controlling it becomes a target for corrupt practices. Once the existing players have the regulatory entity in their pocket, they are somewhat protected from market forces by the very entity create to stabilize the market.
The best thing about Bitcoin: if and when it becomes a major currency, those who do not with to be subject to regulation can simply ignore it and operate outside its reach.

We're going to launch a lingerie store one way or the other. My wife is at the building now, painting.  We live in a very small house, and had already rented the space as a place for our private endeavors - she makes bows and girly stuff, and I make vinyl decals and do some photography, mostly product stuff. Turning a small portion of it into a retail space just makes sense as our little girl gets older (she's 3).

Exactly what I wrote last night before my laptop battery died and I lost it :)
An LLC *is* an "actual corporation", it's just designed for smaller businesses. Primary differences include:
* By default, LLCs are taxed as partnerships/SPs from a federal perspective. This can be changed to mirror a regular corporation with a simple filing.
* LLCs may have a maximum of 35 investors, other than "accredited" investors. LLC shares may not be solicited to the general public.
* LLCs typically have fewer filing requirements with the state of incorporation - although, in my personal opinion, one would be making a mistake to be casual about this. I own two LLCs and am a member of a third, and I make sure to hold quarterly meetings complete with recorded minutes, take a recorded vote on issues of importance, and establish written policies for use of company funds and such.

Oh ya? I'm not competent enough with the theory behind this area of computer science, but I believe there is a minimum amount of energy required to store and retrieve a single bit. If nothing else, this puts a cap upon the upper limits of a fiat currency.

I'm no lawyer, but I am quite familiar with firearms law. I believe that the biggest problem you'll face is with your accountant, and the capital gain/loss due to market fluctuations of the price of BTC&lt;-&gt;USD.
If you're not trying to stockpile Bitcoins, Bit-Pay would probably let you get around that completely. That way, you would only receive USD, and there would be no concern.
I'm treating BTC the same as I would the purchase of a license key to software - it's a cost of doing business. If I sell BTC to USD, it would be no different that if I had sold my Photoshop license on eBay. It's just more income.
I haven't sold any of the Bitcoin my business holds yet, so I don't know. I bet I'm going to have to pay capital gains tax on it, though.
It's going to be interesting to see this work its way through the court system. The argument could be made that no one "owns" Bitcoins at all, but merely purchases knowledge of its location.

So, do something about it. Why expect someone else to do it?
Such is life. Bitcoin is all the bad parts of anarchy without the good. You can get screwed - hard - with no legal recourse, but the law is happy to step in to protect the person who screwed you.
My only opposition to you is that you characterize anarchists in a way that isn't universal. There are lots of kids out there that wear black and protest a bunch, and call themselves anarchists.  Then, there are principled people who have a well-founded belief that government is an unnecessary evil. I'm a deontological libertarian, not a hoodlum.

Thanks very much for posting this - I'm looking for a way to get interested in learning Python, and after having spent the last 6 hours reading about the language, your example code has me connected to MtGox in less than 5 minutes.

Do you have a Bitcoin address handy? I'd like to through a few Bitcents your way as a "thank you"...
@_date: 2011-12-12 14:57:54
I use Ecwid, which doesn't have a way to display price in BTC, or an automated way to take payment.
If a customer wants to pay in BTC (which I offer), they check out and choose "Bitcoin" as their payment method. When I get the email, I convert the USD price to BTC using the 24h weight avg at bitcoincharts.com. Then I generate an address and email it. When the money is confirmed, I ship.
It isn't perfect, but my volume is low. I even give a discount for using BTC.
@_date: 2011-12-19 14:15:42
We had a bubble due to hype - we are now in the long road back to those conversion rates.  My prediction: Bitcoin will be trading at $20 USD again in 3-5 years. That is assuming that neither Bitcoin crashes due to cryptographic failure nor the USD crashes due to monetary policy.

Gotchya. So you're not really providing a wallet service per se, but a more full-featured competitor to the Block Explorer.

It's a valid criticism, though a short-sighted one --- if it's such a scam, why aren't they buying? Bitcoin has in-built deflation long-term and inflation short-term - even so, prices are going up.  If they really thought it was a scam, they would *be* the early adopters. The deflationary period hasn't even begun.
@_date: 2011-12-12 20:54:02
It's "BitcoinSpinner" - based on BCCAPI, so it doesn't maintain a local blockchain.  It does, however, maintain your private keys locally, which is reasonably secure (as secure as your device).
It also allows you to backup and restore wallets based on a QR code, and send/recieve the same way.  I like it so far, and see no reason to be leery of it.

Unlike gold, its value can go to zero.

The net effect on the price would be zero if every merchant immediately sold their bitcoins - but the effect of more BTC circulating would mean that more people would be holding more bitcoin for commercial transactions - so secondary effects would drive the price up even absent merchants holding coin for themselves.
@_date: 2011-12-19 22:48:57
I got out at $18, just before the bubble burst.  I'm trying to actually use BTC now, and see it growing over the next couple of years - so i'm putting a few % of my income into them over the next few months.
I've saved about $1,500 to move into them, and tried to do so via Dwolla-&gt;MtGox-&gt;offline wallet.  Between the time I pulled the cash from my bank and it hit my Dwolla account, BTC has gone from $3.16 USD to $3.50 USD.  By the time I actually get Bitcoins in my wallet, I bet they'll be $4.25.
I hate trying to catch the bubble... but it sure is a fun ride to the top.

Regulation prevents ATMs in the States at the moment.
I think we (as a community) are missing out trying to get businesses we frequent to accept BTC. They don't have a compelling reason to do so yet.
Think about a pawn shop, though. They often do things off the books, and are probably very likely to have checks and credit card charges reversed. Bitcoin would be great for that.
Jewelry stores are great because they have huge average purchases, comparitively. A single chargeback of $2,000 could seriously hurt a small store. It happens today - but Bitcoin would be great for that.
Hell, I was in a Mexican restaurant yesterday, and got my waiter signed up for a Coinbase account. He sends his family in Guatemala money every week via Western Union. This week, he set up a localbitcoins.com transaction remotely for them - saved him $8.00 in transaction fees, *and* there's a better USD/GTQ conversion rate to boot.
We have to figure out who can benefit from Bitcoin's strengths, and market to them.

Then I noticed a spot in my profile for my PGP pubkey. I figured it was for PMs between users or something, so I entered it... and got the option to encrypt all email from Kraken to me.  I'm impressed.
Now, obviously there is no proof yet that they're not just putting this all on as a show. I'm impressed so far, though, and since they offer fairly advanced limit orders I'll be using their service to manage my float that I've been using to trade on LocalBitcoins.com

She had seen it on CNN or something, and knew it was rising exponentially. My basic talking point on that is that we've never witnessed the birth of a decentralized currency. Traditional investments acting like Bitcoin would be a sure bubble - but Bitcoin isn't a traditional investment.
Think about it this way - if all 21m coins were in circulation (they won't be until 2035-ish) and every adult in the US wanted to buy some, the most they could get on average would be about 100 mBTC. Right now, that's worth $100. They would have to increase at least 100-fold if they were used in regular commerce. Now consider that only about 5% of the world lives in the US...
*If* Bitcoin is a widely adopted and used for most any purpose, its value *must* increase exponentially.
Therefore, yes it scares me that the price is going up so fast - but two years ago, we theorized that this would happen as it was adopted. If it wasn't happening, Bitcoin wouldn't be growing the way it was intended and predicted.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:04:44
I mentioned that earlier - I didn't do any convincing, she made the offer. 
I suspect that's because she's accustomed to dealing with precious metals, where you expect to pay a bit over spot and sell for a bit under. It also didn't hurt that I bought a necklace for my daughter with fiat, off which I'm sure she made a significant profit.

@_date: 2013-11-28 06:48:30
I do think it will keep rising, actually. It's just that Bitcoin has grown so much faster than everything else I own that it's now a very large part of my investment portfolio, and I'm not comfortable with that level of exposure.
I'm buying metal not because I think it will do better than Bitcoin, but because I'm confident I won't take a substantial loss on it regardless of events.

Without something opaque in there, you could just shine a light through it to read the private keys :)


I used the Satoshi client on an ancient Compaq I had on hand. I installed a very old version of Debian, sideloaded the client (an older version, checksum verified) on an empty USB drive, and printed it from there. I used the old version of Debian because I had it on a physical CD from long ago, and I knew it couldn't contain malware designed to mess with Bitcoin. I used an old version of the Bitcoin client under the premise that the code has had longer to have been reviewed and major alarm bells would have sounded if a hack had been found.
There are some potential holes in this method (The USB drive could have been compromised at the hardware level), but it's as secure as I know how to make it. I only planned to do it once, so I took went did my best to eliminate potential information leaks. 
Downloading brainwallet.org onto a USB drive, unplugging your router and rebooting into Live CD environment and doing everything would almost certainly be just as secure.

Definitely intentional. I'm putting together "merchant kits" with informational literature for the business owner, brochures for customers, and a couple of window decals.

You can assign a password, but as far as I can tell, you have to create the wallet first. That means at some point there is a wallet file on your machine with at least one private key in it, unencrypted.
On backups, I know it keeps them in at least one location other than the "live" wallet. I've not investigated that further, but IMO a client should be absolutely 100% explicit about where your private keys are located. Multibit on OSX keeps them buried in a library folder.

The amount that is "significant" scales with how much people can get ahold of.


It won't be the only cryptocurrency used. It will almost certainly be the most popular decentralized, deflationary cryptocurrency in the future because of its first-mover advantage. I can easily see a company like Bank of America getting their shit together and creating a *centralized* cryptocurrency backed by bullion in a vault.  That kind of competition is good for the economy, and good for the world.


You've made the assertion, but I fail to see that you've shown a problem exists.


Altcoins will pop up and go through their growth cycle. The vast majority will die before gaining critical mass necessary to be used as a currency. Some will get there (Litecoin will, IMO), and they will serve as either a secondary market for people who need those features, or the unique aspects that made them popular will be integrated into Bitcoin.
The only way I see an altcoin surpassing Bitcoin is if it:
* provides something Bitcoin doesn't
* people want what it provides
* Bitcoin can't implement the idea into the existing protocol
It *could* happen, but I believe it to be highly unlikely.

I'm not sure why I would lie about it, but I also understand that skeptics are drawn to a currency that is built around the idea that one shouldn't *have* to trust. :)
The experiences were mostly positive, but we did have an issue with Coinbase that I need to submit a ticket to them for. I sent the initial payment to an email address. The merchant clicked the link in the email they got, went to the transaction, clicked "accept".... and got a 404. I had him try to log out and back in, and got the same result.
I had him cancel the payment (which works instantly, much to my surprise!), and used it as an opportunity to show off the merchant tools. He made a "pay with Bitcoin" button, clicked it, and I scanned the QR code with my phone. That transaction creditted within seconds. It was off-chain, which we talked about.
The mild trouble didn't sour him on Bitcoin or Coinbase, though. He said he wasn't planning on hooking up a bank account at all, but holding the BTC.


I know that's possible - I've had significant BTC stolen from me via a compromised MtGox account. I don't think it will happen in this case, though. I trust Coinbase not to be malicious, and while they're not as competent as I'd like they're going to be more competent than most beginners would be. With the lady who set up with Blockchain.info instead, I'm confident she'll have it moved to cold storage within a week. I can't say enough how suprised I was at her enthusiasm. I hope I'm half as flexible mentally when I'm her age.


My title - while accurate - might be a *tad* misleading.  Both businesses accept my BTC for a transaction, but neither are yet set up to take it at POS or online on a regular basis. I intend to check back with them in a week or so and help them along as necessary.


I've had no luck at all with the business I typically frequent. I had a bit of an epiphany today that those businesses don't have as much to gain. Jewelers traditionally deal in precious metals, and deal with large international payments. Those are the sort of things that Bitcoin excels at, even today. Other businesses that come to mind are pawn shops - I won over a small pawn shop in Arkansas before I moved this summer. 
Ethnic restaurants are another where I think I'll see success. Many of the workers there are first-generation immigrants, and send money back to their home countries. They eat a hefty service fee every time they do it, too.

XBT is the presumptive ISO code for Bitcoin. I tried to use it, but it didn't work out :)
I've taken to using mBTC (pronounced "millibit") to denominate transactions under 3 BTC, and the suffixes "BTC" and "mBTC" for written communications.

Seems reasonable to me.
Even though I'm doing some transactions on LocalBitcoins.com, a lot of what I'm transferring out of my WF account is staying in Bitcoin. The best part of that - there's no way for them to know :)

I'm confident that it will be at least $800.
I strongly suspect that it will be &gt; $1,500.

So.... like a personal Mr. Nice Guy?

That would be hard to do in a secure way.

If by "Bitcoin Gun", you mean "a gun bought with Bitcoin" - I have one of those :)

Today, I spent 800 mBTC on jewelry for my wife and daughter.
Within 10 minutes, I'd replaced it in my Coinbase account.
Bitcoin is not yet a good store of value - too volatile. It's a speculation instrument for the time being.
... but it's *also* a means of transferring value, and that utility is there whether a single BTC is worth $1 or $1m.

That's a damned good point. Now they know for a fact that you bank at Wells Fargo, and use Coinbase. That's a lot to go on if they already had (for instance) a Bitcointalk username and password for you.

I recommend two things: 
Buy assets other than Bitcoin if you don't have any. That means stock, bonds, etc. Contribute to a 401k or 403b, or even a Roth IRA if that's all you're eligible for. If you have those things, then buy real estate if you can afford it. Cash out 20% of your wealth and do this now, with the advice of a tax attorney so you have your tax liability pre-funded. Don't wait.
Buy physical metals. You won't be making money on these, but that's not their purpose. If Bitcoin crashes, that money is gone. If the stock market tanks, your investments there are gone. Nothing - and I mean nothing - will destroy value that you have stored in gold and silver.

I keep my paper wallets in a safety deposit box, so it still somewhat applies.
@_date: 2013-11-28 04:35:20
I'm not sure honestly. Fuck 'em.
I did buy gold though - and gold and other PMs are considered investments, at least for some IRA purposes.

The owner really surprised me with how enthusiastic she was and how fast she picked up the concepts. My plan was to set her up with a Coinbase account by sending the coin payment to her address - but when I told her they wanted her phone number and name to set up the account, she asked for alternatives.
