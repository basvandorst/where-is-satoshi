Right now people are buying bitcoins because they expect the price will go up. This is speculation, not inherent worth. When enough people decide they want to claim their profits, they will sell their bitcoins for cash. This will cause a decline in price, more people will sell fearing a crash, the bubble will burst, and prices will return to reality. 
Until then, it's all a gamble.

Good idea...a smartphone app would be next once I get the desktop version running well. I have one for android now but its ugly and has ads...two things I hope to avoid.

and for those who don't sell, 10% of your listing goes to ebay in fees, and another 10% goes to paypal for fees. its insane.

they're not illegal. some exchanges are even working to get recognized and have their transactions covered under existing depositer's insurance laws. if you make money off them, you may have to declare that as income or capital gains, but there's nothing inherently illegal in exchanging fiat money for gold, silver, or virtual currency..
