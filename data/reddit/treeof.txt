Nope. Not even remotely.

Its all about having a bullet anyways.

Sell 86% of your BC and park the cash in something safer - returning your BC to 2% of your total holdings.

Saving for later! Thanks :)

It will be quickly forgotten by those who didn't lose any money. 
As for those that did lose money, I suspect they will remember it far longer than the rest of us.

Especially with all the tax consequences from receiving gifts in excess of 10k.

I see what you're saying, you're right. I was (poorly) thinking about what happens after mining is complete. But that's currently an academic issue rather than a real one and not entirely relevant to this conversation. Cheers!

I mean, in the mid 2000's or so, someone on slashdot posted a Diebold ATM service manual and in it was the global master password. Me, feeling saucy one day, tried it on a local ATM, only to discover it worked. I quickly logged out and left without pulling any cash but it did work! I'm sure they've changed it in the last 20 years but there's a considerable amount of security through obscurity in the world.

There's no assurance, so I'm happy that he isn't making it sound any other way. This shit isn't FDIC Insured and we shouldn't act or pretend like it is.

Right? Anyone who can get rid of BCH is going to have a great day!

I don't dispute that, in fact that is the movie that Sublime sampled from for their track Smoke Two Joints.

I can't speak for what he's serving , but the cops definitely will!!

Well no shit.

I had never heard of this. It seems, at least initially, to be a potentially good idea. But, I wonder if after a year I really would net the number of bitcoins necessary for this to be a net positive investment.

I believe that we won't see any new whistle blowers for quite a while. I am damn sure they are running psych profiles on everyone to try to determine the "type" to leak and then exclude them.

Also, isn't it defcon weekend? I am sure lots of transactions are occurring due to that.
@_date: 2013-07-29 03:36:00
maybe? But I would definitely advise a full wipe. 
@_date: 2013-08-08 20:49:00
Zomg the ROI
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:34:21
Investing heavily in Freudian slips, I see.
