Being against an open source patch/announcement solution on an OSS because it makes the vulnerabilities more known leaves the opposer with an open/close source hybrid solution as what was attempted....and if the opposer also opposes that all solutions are exhausted and the opposer based on their previous statements has to yield there is no ideal solution or they really just like having cake and eating it too.
Do not mistake my critiquing a hypocritical/cake stance in relation to patching/annoucements *and* that of complaining about closed source on a 'closed' forum of a OSS as an endorsement of BU's open/close source solution they recently attempted to take [per my comment elsewhere](

You can't. I'm not saying what BU did recently with closed source is ideal or right. If anything I think the standard for open source projects for vulnerability patches and announcements that [Red Hat]( or other largely adopted open source projects follow is the way BU should probably proceed following community discussions and consensus. Going by posts in btc I believe the BU community is very much aware of the issues of such bugs and is working to come up with a better standardized process with dealing with them. Time will tell how quickly this issue is addressed, but I believe it should be addressed before a BU hard fork is more formally considered.
What I was trying to highlight is the irony of certain people seemingly being both against open source and a closed/open source patching/announcement hybrid as being against both effectively leaves you with no solutions (and the irony of such commentary in an open source project based sub that will likely never retro-actively 'open source' all the comments that were deleted or shadowed because the comments while non-toxic, didn't agree with the centralized agenda that was trying to be pushed here or in other forums)

Strange then that out of the DDoS attacks in the past month, they have all been against BU...it's almost as if Core supporters will do whatever it takes to try to blow up BU.

Wait, isn't complaining about trying to release a vulnerability patch in a non-public commit after complaining about a separate incident of BU making a different vulnerability known in a public commit called "having your cake and eating it too" AKA hypocrisy?
Last time I checked the BU changes will be made public which is more than what can be said for the thousands of censored comments on this sub.

Arguably Monero. Zcash isn't exploring broadcasting through the Tor or I2P networks and privacy is optional in Zcash.

And how is BU an 'attack' on the network specifically? BU having to hard fork to truly activate doesn't make an attack in the same way Blizzard hard forking their games with updates and preventing previous versions from running on the network isn't considered an attack simply because it's a hard fork.

Pretty sure Greg who insults his own devs by calling them dipshits in a public forum or any manner of other insults he's thrown at people on his own 'side' qualifies for bigger assholery than anything Ver has done.
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:35:55
And yet Ver challenged Samson to debate. Hmmmm.....
@_date: 2017-04-17 15:52:20


So it's different. That doesn't substantiate it being an attack.


Except that SegWit also changes fundamental block and transaction protocol and in turn exposes new potential vulnerabilities and attack vectors.


Really? Can you demonstrate quantively and prove that without any doubt? Can you prove without a doubt that somehow SegWit is?


Saying attack again doesn't make something an actual attack and at my workplace on the Bitcoin mailing list of almost 200 people, people favor BU...so more than a handful. It's arguably to everyone's advantage to have faster verified transactions. Try again.


Per above, please try again.

How are millionaires attacking the network specifically and can you cite specific instances and proof?
@_date: 2017-04-14 01:41:28
By that same token it should be funny to see people go on about Ver being an asshole.
Last time I checked one doesn't have to be the person who was name-called to call out assholery be it in the CC space or on Wikipedia...Linus and Sarah Sharp, etc....nor have I constantly argued about this. Now and then I just like to call out BS and assholery when I see it. :)

This article does a decent job compared to what I've seen thus far. Tweet served as verification and presumablely in the following two months SS related address got 22K+:
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:10:46
What's interesting is that address getting 22K+ after what seems to be SS confirmation tweet.
@_date: 2017-05-15 19:56:20
I think the OP was in reference to insider trading at Kraken and them now beimg under investigation with Poloniex
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:15:41
Better article IMO sans grammar:
Address in question got 22K+ in the following two months after what seems was a SS verification tweet.
