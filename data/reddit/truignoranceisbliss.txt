Paypal use to be be against anything bitcoin related. Why their change in attitude besides being greedy. What is going to happen to all the people that had their accounts banned for 'bitcoin' reasons. A lawsuit?

Don't use mtGox; Why are people still putting their trust in them?

You actually think Obama himself looks at this shit? You're delirious. None of these petitions have ever brought change. Its a PR stunt for the administration... They try to be transparent, but they still dont know the meaning. I'm sorry to be negitive, but I have seen so many people waste time collecting signatures and NOTHING is changed.. even if you get 100k signatures.. NOTHING will happen in current.. corrupt system.
Our politicians spew lies all the time, but never act on them. It's words to shut people up so they stop bitcing.. The same principles with we the people website. its utter bs.
If you want change, CALL your legislators... email them, write a letter.

There is no view, only login. So LOGIN WALL! which might be a paywall....

Taking the CIA money in the drug war, so the FBI had to step in and stop it. Wonder how many PC's the FBI had to hack. Only part way into the complaint.

I wonder if Paypal will credit those and or re-open accounts that were closed due to persons using Bitcoins. I know of several cases. Seems a bit ironic that Paypal (an unregulated entity and a power of a bank) once hated the idea of bitcoins and any mention got your paypal account closed.  They have flipped 180... Paypal is an evil entity and I wish they are shut down. fuck em! &lt;/rant&gt;

ASSHOLES!!!!! My good friend got one, and it was finally delivered when it was worthless. &lt;/rant&gt;

Did you get the IP from blockchain.info?
  That IP is prolly the relay IP not the IP of said user who nabbed your coins... Common misconception among many ppl that use bitcoin on a witch hunt.

Short-selling websites are offline? Hmmm, yes.... Over the past month price has been increasing.. guys on  don't seem to understand this.
  Short-selling is bad, you bring down the value of btc... 
  I've been mining for almost 2yrs now, and watching things unfold..

Oh, that's a new feature from gox..  Good luck then! :)

mtgox should know where the btc was moved too... which address, it should say in your order history... Are you using the same password/login for other sites? Where did it goto? This sounds fishy too me...
  Create multi wallets for different needs, dont keep all your beans in one..
  Since mtgox started being scandalous and rather fraudulent I stopped using them and have advised others to stop using them. I have been in this btc community for at least a year now and have seen alot of shiit from mtgox. My advice, stay away from them. Use campbx, bitstamp etc...
  Only run the btc client when you need to send coins, no need to keep it running all the time. You can also encrypt your wallet so even if the wallet.dat gets taken they wont be able to crack it...

Here's a recent example of paypal's awesomeness....
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:07:50
CampBX is what I have been using for along time.
@_date: 2013-04-11 03:05:11
afaik, they have always been shaddy. Used em once, and bailed.

Wow, so I'm not the only one. Mine is under 1000k, so it should not be a big deal. I know of others that are close that do 5000+ and it gets processed faster. Thanks for the ideas on getting a response from them, *sigh*

I would have punched peter in the face. Paypal is such a scam. Stopped using paypal years ago due to many issues with their policies and lack of regulation. I would never start a business that works with Paypal. Will just piss off customers. good luck!
@_date: 2013-12-13 22:12:33
Just wanted to update... I got my funds back in my account today.. Total of 18 business days, 11 days of no response from them.. &lt;sarcasm&gt;yea.. great customer service &lt;/sarcasm&gt;

Basically what I said.... They recover wallets from a damaged disks... Prove the disks or wallet was stolen.. prove its yours.. It's all anonymous, its how the protocol was designed.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:09:06
Everyone would stop using them if they knew about their shady practices when they first hit the scene. POS exchanger.
@_date: 2013-08-13 20:30:14
This sounds like a scam to me..... But all it seems like they do is recover wallets from damaged disks... that's not hard....
