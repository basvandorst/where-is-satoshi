Consistently changing aka volatility has been decreasing for a while. 
Whether bitcoin is to be used as a store of value or a type of currency that's actively spent, the fact remains: stable growth is continuining to happen and wild swings in price are happening less and less. Chart:

Bitcoin is long past the point of being able to mine with a computer -  it's all specialized hardware now that was made specifically for mining bitcoin. 
You could mine for bitcoin on your computer, but you'll spend far more in increased electricity costs and won't make much, if anything, while mining.

A little of both. I've made a few purchases with btc on places like purse.io and newegg and will be funding an upcoming trip to Europe with it as well.
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:32:02
What about large percentage increases/decreases to itself? I don't believe its stability is relative to another currency or asset.
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:54:32
Of course. If a country's currency is highly volatile and in an overall downward trend, it would make sense for them to move it to something with an overall increasing trend, even if it's volatile, given they might be limited on investment options to begin with. 
In my example, I'm mostly just referring to currencies of first world countries that are stable and have a lot of purchasing power, like the US dollar or the Euro.

But if either one of those gets lost or stolen? Unless you're suggesting keeping my pass keys split up or duplicate across devices?

It's "soaring" $14 above $1,100 as I type this. God I hate this clickbaity shit. Frig off, businessinsider.

You won't be able to mine with a "fancy" computer.
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:12:12
I can't disagree with that it's easy and basically free, but I think they're a little bit more important than the "no one cares" level you put them at. 
@_date: 2017-02-20 20:41:04
I love watching you guys just pull numbers out of your asses.
@_date: 2017-02-23 15:25:04
They don't deserve your business then. If you're trying to use a specific site for a purchase, make a post on here about alternatives that don't require coinbase. There are probably some different choices.
@_date: 2017-02-21 20:12:48
Thanks. Are there any numbers as to what percentage of nodes are miners? Just curious.
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:07:26
You diversified which is always the right move. Yeah, everything in hindsight, but these gains in btc could disappear tomorrow for all we know. You're in the green already. Don't be greedy. :) 
@_date: 2017-02-23 21:06:21
Hey, thanks! Prague is on the tentative list. If it's on the final list I'll definitely reach out. Planning two months in total.
@_date: 2017-02-23 00:57:14
I've thought of this idea, but can't help thinking that carrying sheets of paper would be the safest option. Maybe there's a specific way to do it? 
@_date: 2017-02-23 18:38:12
Sorry, you are correct. I misunderstood your comment. I do think that stability is important though. If we're to compare it to USD, small positive percentage increases would do more for BTC than large swings, both negative and positive, would. No layman is going to want to put their short-term savings in a currency or asset that is all over the place in volatility.
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:48:04
Eli5 what that will do or what it is? I recently diversified into ETH and feel like there are so many active projects that I can't keep up. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 01:00:02
Ideally spend at places that accept btc or use one of the ATMs there. I've heard that Europe has quite a few. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:36:21
This is a new level of shit post. Well done.

How is in 'conceding' to BU with a hardfork? Yeah, the price and network might suffer in the short-term but long-term? They have a coin created out of poorly-vetted code and want to compete against Core and the majority percentage of users and exchanges backing it. If you're confident in Core's ideology, future, and are a "hodler" - why are you scared about short-term implications? I say let them fork already and let's move on - months of inaction hasn't brought about any change. Maybe I missed something but we need to end this already. Compromises have not, are not, and will not happen with either group.
@_date: 2017-03-13 17:22:01
I hope this fork happens..and soon. Bitcoin Core vs. Bitcoin Unlimited. We have been at an impasse for a while. The exchanges, hardware, miners, nodes, and hobby investors have already said, some multiple times, who they stand behind. At this point, no one is changing their minds.
This fork needs to happen. There needs to be a winner and a loser, and then bitcoin will progress further. Until then, nothing will change for the better.
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:57:19
That's the spirit, old boy! 
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:12:36
"If we all just breathe out, and put aside our differences and emotions (even just for a while), let’s accept that doing a Hard Fork right now is NOT in the best interest of Bitcoin and let’s please just adopt Segwit."
...as if no one has said that so far. I'm a Core supporter but come on...if putting aside emotions was in fact possible, we would have long since solved the issue at hand. Instead, I'm over here watching this continued gridlock and trading out my BTC for ETH. I want to go all in on Bitcoin, but this inaction has dragged on too long.

Dude says he doesn't have a lot of experience with guitar and you recommend him a niche $1,000-$2,000 guitar manufacturer. Solid advice. /s
OP, go to Guitar Center and just play different ones. See how the necks feel in your hand. Some will be wide..others will be narrow. Some will have a thicker feel while others will be thinner. It all comes down to what feels best to you. Don't worry so much about tone - that's easily changed with effects, amps, and amp modelers.
@_date: 2017-03-19 15:20:44
Very interesting. Thanks for the summary on it!
@_date: 2017-03-10 20:50:54
Don't try to time the market. You will lose. 
Buy it if you believe in its longterm success. The rollercoaster isn't going to calm down anytime soon, ETF or not.

Is a pretentious hardfork a hardfork that wears a scarf in the middle of July?
@_date: 2017-05-17 17:01:57
I would say the exact same thing to the folks over in r/btc. The us vs. them mentality from both sides has strangled any semblance of advancement.
@_date: 2017-05-17 15:48:30
Same threads..over and over, ad nausem. I waited years for progess and cashed out after receiving none of it. Glad I switched to cryptos that are continuing to make technological advances and not wasting away in technological gridlock. Bring on the downvotes. You know I'm right.
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:27:21
Minus the part about faster transactions, lower fees, and not having 100,000 unconfirmed transactions. But hey, go ahead and keep your head in the sand. Everything is alright.
