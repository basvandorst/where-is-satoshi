Won't disagree nginx is ideal for Static content, like using as a reverse proxy.
Many do use it for dynamic sites (PHP FastCGI + MYSQL is not difficult). Nginx does have a few things apache does easier, but you save alot of ram and cpu resources.
Wordpress sites is a very popular one to move to have a nginx stack;

The Reddit API has limits.  (unreddit uses it)
It is rare / unusual, but people don't complain about a comment that was changed or deleted. The detail on whom editted or deleted it is vague I won't disagree, doesn't mean it didn't happen. 
I'm sure you heard the philosophical thought experiment, "If a tree falls in a forest and no one is around to hear it, does it make a sound?" It raises questions regarding observation and knowledge of reality. If the comments aren't seen (by most) what impact can this have on the discussion of the masses.
This sub does have a reputation for excessive moderation, hence the usefulness to see what was deleted to see a balanced view incase one perspective was muted. 
Sometimes they are just rude comments, others it is questionable and it was removed maybe more for personal reasons, complaining or reporting has shown to be useless.

Notice how often the mods deleted comments on how to disable custom CSS and override sub Reddit prefs.

Pretty summed up what I was going to say. 
If Bitlicenses became a normal thing for everywhere (State or Countries), it will cripple any company trying to be an exchange.
However, I can't blame any exchange for taking this stance, there is not enough profit and hassle that makes it worth while.

Saw this coming a mile off. I'm not glad I'm in the UK, because I can't do anything. Shit like this fucks with the price globally, it has no borders.

Not going to argue there, most do. But at least you know it's about bitcoin, that is about where it ends. After that you might find out what sort of company it is.
It having "Bit" or "coin" or "insert term here" in it is important from a SEO point of view unfortunately, that is why these company names suck. We live in a world were they know they will only get noticed online.
Of course some succeeded without these SEO related names, but often still had silly names, because they were the first at something, so dominated because no else did it yet with Bitcoin.

People stick to what they know, hard to shake that from some people.

Being from the UK, visited NY and SF, I don't see the appeal of the "Big City" life people talk about.
There is a lot of nice places in rural locations, just saying, natural beauty and frequently cost of living is tiny compared to the "Big City".
If you just want to avoid NY, due to the Bitlicense the last places you should go is SF, that will be a target eventually.

This might not been why I got into Bitcoin, but close.
Anything remotely operating via banks, charge a fortune to do anything internationally, compared to what it could cost, this was proved when bitcoin came onto the scene.

Bitcoin should never have a financial hub, the nearest thing should always remain symbolically the internet.
Either way, the US will never be it, they love their banks too much.

Just like Bitcoin Wallets, Tor, comes in a few flavours too.
@_date: 2015-08-19 13:30:18
true, I'm not going to disagree with that.
Bitcoin, was not the first to find "bit" useful in their SEO. 
Asshats will always exists, can't do much about that, if they want to make a fake or pretend website let them.

While I've not done this, nor do I know if it will work in practise for your intended purpose in full, but would working with a company like Bitwage work?
If they paid into a "bitwage" bank account provided, you'd get bitcoins in return, with minimal fuss.
Personally I'd rather know the few in the industry that do this, what ones can be trusted?

Ok guess I should rephase, appeal and actually change his sentence.
Significant evidence was purpose left out, that could painted a very different picture of what really went on.
I have no doubt any could appeal, but success is another matter.

Patients not worth anything, there was prior use. 
If they ever try to exert anything with these, they will (all) get invalidated quickly.
It just shows how little due diligence the patent office does.

He was convicted by Jury (from what I read), I think the very agency (agent) suppose to investigate him and the operation, were corrupt, would pull into question the evidence, thus making it questionable and/or fabricated. Ruining their whole case against him.
I'm not disagreeing R. Ulbricht might of played his part, but when someone in a position of power is caught abusing their position, they lose all creditability and what they've been investigating has to be looked at again, undoing their corrupt behaviour.
Can't exactly do that, if their was never a strong link between his real name, and the nickname, which the "evidence" is connected to.

Pretty sure you going to have a price flucation, when you encourage your entire user base to cash out their bitcoins for Dollars at a recent low in the market.

I'm not doubting you can spin up GPU instances (Nvidia GPU's I beleive), but they are labelled as such, which the little proof provided, these were not.
Also not challenging the part of efficiency, it doesn't matter if your not paying, but it's a bit stupid, not to spin up the right tool for the task.

Posting about your idea in public was probably not a good idea, so your "fictitious" bitcoins will be a problem if you want it to be anonymous now.

I admit, I don't know know your laws well, but damn, Ross got play but atleast he got a chance of an appeal now, right?

I'm not doubting he blamed other things, changed his mind and also blamed himself, but this section is still up...

Banks don't want to look at the open ledger != can't see a full payments trail.
Uses a BS excuse to hide discrimination.

I feel for this guy, but throwing bitcoin into the mix is nonsense. None of the EC2 Instances' were going to be of any significant use to bitcoin mining.
Fling dirt if you got proof or it makes senses, but if stuff like this happens don't blame the innocent.
The real people to blame is the software you were using, who exposed your account. If you don't know who misused your account, don't take uneducated guess'.

Use Tor and/or a good scrubbing VPN like VyprVPN (Golden Frog) and you are all good.
Tbh, sad to see that level of censorship.

This is another big leap foward for Bitcoin.
A leap not everyone will like, but a leap none the less that will reinforce it's place.
