Probably gold.
It's not electronic, so it comes with the obvious drawbacks of being physical and can't be sent over the internet.
But it's based on the consensus of people and not a government, it's divisible, identical, not very hard to verify (density test...), has a limited supply and slowly (and predictably) inflates, and the inflation rate is constrained by a non-political rule set (mining technology/area).
In the perspective of pre 20th century, most of these attributes held up pretty well so gold was the standard currency for most of history.

You should be able to safely use it online (well as long as your computer isn't infested with viruses).
The wallet.dat file is enough if you didn't encrypt it (but most wallets ask you to put a password in at some point). Then if you put a password in they need wallet.dat + your password.
So as long as you don't have a keylogger virus (which I think are easier to catch by an AV) then you should be fine.

To expand on gnaritas, the dev's are the ones working on the bulk of the code, but anyone is free to review it at any time and especially before a hard fork. 
If there's ever any flaw or mischief from the dev's it will quickly get attention and the fork would likely be abandoned. 
Basically it only takes on reddit or bitcointalk post to raise awareness of a major problem, and until that happens the people generally trust the devs.

Seriously, what do you hope to accomplish? It's much easier to buy on the market than to go through all the hassle to buy through the auction.
And there's 3 outcomes. It sells less than market value, in which case the market will probably go down a bit allowing more people to buy at roughly that price. It sells at market value, see above paragraph. Or it sells above market price at which point you're screwing the small guy over instead of the big guy.

I'm not very experienced in this so I'm just going to put out some suggestions:
Have a cold wallet and a bunch of hot wallets unless your money moves really fast, in which case only hot wallets will do. Upper management will have to sign infrequent transactions from cold to hot.
Make a hot wallet for each of the authorised member of staff or each group of members. You have to trust them in either case (bank or bitcoin), and this will limit how much someone can steal if that happens.
Your idea of 2 of 3 sigs is nice. To do it, you can have a small computer locked up who only signs transactions given by your verifying software. Basically a simple program that can only receive transaction information (no other commands) and only sends out signed transactions (no private keys), and it's behind a safe or something.

@_date: 2014-05-20 01:15:38
Most hard disks don't immediately write on top of deleted data (so the data isn't permanently erased). This is the same principle "undelete" software uses.
Basically the hard disk has a header that points out where exactly each file is located. When you delete something you only modify the header to say there's no file there anymore. But actually the bits are still there until the computer decides to use that part of the hard disk again. And because they way hard disks get used up, they're optimized to use the same place as rarely as possible.

Going to give you that for now. But it will matter in the long run. The government, if bitcoin were to become main currency, will able to impose the same rules on bitcoin.
Yes, there will be technological workarounds, but if we don't keep the government under control, they'll just be banned.
Good thing with bitcoin though is the rules will be put in the population's face (so we'll be better motivated to take action), whereas now they are hidden by a layer of banks.

That was the first transaction so there was no price before then (or there was but it was 0). Yes, buying the pizzas created the first non zero price, and people likely started trading based on that price afterwards (or at least that order of magnitude of the price).
@_date: 2014-05-04 01:00:43
Pretty much yes. 
1. But unlike using something like US dollars, Bitcoin has a fixed set of rules so no individual or zone loses any control by not actively participating.
2. Besides anyone is still free to run a node, its just more expensive (compared to food) in 3rd world countries.
3. There's really not much bandwidth that can be saved. You still need at least 1 sender 1 receiver 1 hash (and a little more info) for each transaction. And to run a full node you need to get every transaction. So no matter what political stance you have, this technical issue won't disappear.

But actually no, unless you know all the addresses of a full layer of the government. (As in the layer that collects all taxes, or the layer that spends all taxes).
Otherwise your small part in the tax system can easily go to one small part in the government. But that isn't representative as the government would use someone else's money to pay for something else.

This seems like the best idea. There are already free pools, but the big variance prevents them from taking off.
Best would be to run a p2pool node that takes the variance out, and they can set it up so it pays miners exactly when they need it in what currency they need.

It is a biggie. At 51% hash rate you can orphan all the other blocks.
The 6 confirmation limit is to guard against someone with a low % of hash rate being malicious (10-30). If someone has between 30-50% you can require more confirmations to be secure. But the moment someone reaches 51% it's not secure anymore no matter the nr of confirms.

1) It's really really really hard to have a coded solution to pools or something equivalent, if not actually impossible.
The issue with mining is that it HAS to be parallel, so that anyone can participate at will. With that being the only assumption it's trivial to make an agreement where miners share the block reward in return for more regular but smaller payments.
2) It's not actually the end of bitcoin, it's an unfortunate phase. There's negligible incentive for miners to gather into pools larger than 5%. (while there's an obvious disincentive to gather into very large pools because the value of bitcoin as a whole decreases). This is hopefully an unfortunate state where ghash.io where the only ones to offer mining shares and got a giant advantage because they were the first. I'm hoping 2 months from now, people will have migrated to comparable services that offer same quality/price, but have a better reputation.

You're wrong here. At 51% you can keep mining only your own blocks and ignore every other, because at the end of the day you will have produced the longest chain.
Under 50% it requires luck to double spend because you'll still be outpaced by the other miners.

It does matter (as in make it better), but you enter into a weird prisoners dilemma with the miners.
The operator controls what goes in the block, the miners just find a suitable hash. So the operators have everything they need to pull an attack, at least until it's detected (which will be instantly). At which point they need a way to keep the miners still in their pool. 
Now there are some coded ways we can prevent from this attack (i don't know the details of this though), but lets consider a 51% attack where the operator only mines on his own chain and orphans all other blocks. This prevents everyone else from getting any rewards.
At this point each individual miner's incentive is to join the evil pool so they can keep getting something. While the whole collective of miners' incentive is to move away from the pool (to maintain the dencentralized nature of bitcoin, which is probably its essential feature). The dilemma occurs because if less than half of miners switch, they get left out (and you also have to consider that the attacking pool itself has some hardware).

Also might be a good point if they advertise it. You can't have hidden fees or recurring payments since the customer has to sign everything.

No because they can use their own strategy to go around the caps.
You can record the bad transactions and stop them but you still have to follow the longest blockchain, so if the miner controls it he can still do whatever.

The problem is with the first past the post system, voting 3rd party damages your representation.
Here's a simple example, say there are 2 main parties A and Z and currently A is voted by 55%. Imagine a new party B comes in, it has its own unique thing, but is most similar to A. If people vote for B they will likely switch from A, if B now gains 15% of the vote, thus A loses 15%, the winner of the election becomes Z with the 45%, which is the opposite of what both people voting for A and B wanted.

Well nobody knows exactly what's going to happen otherwise they'd be rich. But the China deadline may make bitcoin fluctuate hard one way or another.
But since you're not a day trader, and you're not really that interested in timing the market perfectly but rather actually getting your funds into btc, I'd recommend you should be averaging your buys: set a fixed interval at which you will always buy a small amount of coins for a period.
Ex. buy 3000 dollars worth of bitcoins every day for a period of a month. You essentially buy at that month's average, which if you believe in bitcoin for the long term, should be fair price. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 23:54:03
No, but this is what traders do (for everything, not only bitcoin). Every time someone has some information on what the future price would be (Christmas, national bread day, upcoming product launch, etc.) they can make a trade in anticipation of the event, which affects the price a bit, causing it to appear smoother.
Imagine this very unrealistic scenario where bitcoins are twice as valuable on a Thursday, very regularly. What will quickly happen is that some traders will start buying bitcoins on Wednesday and selling them on Thursday. But those buy on Wednesday will cause the price to raise in anticipation of Thursday so Thursday isn't that big an increase in price anymore. Eventually people buy on Tuesday in anticipation of Wednesday's price increase, and so on until it reaches full circle and the price becomes equal over the entire week.

I should've finished my argument. We did collectively agree to this, and it's pretty well established. We also collectively agreed (somehow) to form a government which establishes rules for our society. And within those rules banks formed which we decided to use. So in a sense the rules the bank impose on us are part of how society views money.
In any case, we delegated those powers so their implementation didn't turn out exactly as society wanted, and in some cases far from what society wanted.
But still society is made up of many people and so the better outcome is when we're provided with more choices (and here bitcoin opens up the avenue for many new choices of handling money). 
And back to the original topic. I for one would still store a part of my wealth in a bank that limits the amount of money I can take out for the security that it gives. That still means the wealth is mine even though I have to give a reason to get access to most of it, I just allowed the bank that power by banking with them.
@_date: 2014-05-26 15:39:59
Well if you keep taking all the advantages presented and then saying if people don't care about those it stops being a reasonable discussion.
Anyways, it takes a bunch of people to care about some of these issues and bitcoin will grow and coexist with other payment methods on roughly equal terms. And when its ubiquitous enough, there won't be any extra hurdles in dealing with bitcoin.
At that point, the main currency of each individual will switch from local-&gt;bitcoin more often than bitcoin-&gt;local because bitcoins has those advantages (also it has the pontential to be more secure and slightly cheaper than credit cards).
And if it continues like this for a while (assuming bitcoin becomes really popular), it might become the main currency at which point there are more hurdles to jump through to use local currency rather than bitcoins.
And the transition might occur first in countries where local currency is actually really bad (Portugal for example). There people actively care about the properties you ignored. If it does ever become the primary currency of one country, then because it's global the process in others is also encouraged (by giving it a baseline, reducing risk, and legitimizing it (you won't have governments banning bitcoin anymore because of international politics)).
@_date: 2014-06-17 15:16:48
You actually need a reverse turing test! Where a computer can determine if it's talking to a human or another computer.
The crucial bit of the proof is that it can easily be verified by ALL nodes (otherwise the attacker just verifies it with his own malicious nodes).
On the other hand proof of human is the best option there is. Unlikely to ever happen though, unless we involve governments. In which case we go back to good ol centralization.

Money doesn't exist without society, so it will never be solely yours. You're doing the same thing with bitcoin, its just a few steps shorter.
The banks have to obey the law which is enforced/made by the government which is voted in by the people. Well that's the intention at least; point is the people make the rules.
With bitcoin you have the governing rules (except value) set in stone more or less. The people that elect to follow them (bitcoiners) are still the ones to give it value.

Leverage: you borrow USD and buy bitcoin, hope bitcoin increases than sell them for more than you bought. Repay the USD.
Short: you borrow bitcoin sell for USD, hope it goes down, then rebuy bitcoin and give them back to the borrower.
The thing about borrowing, is that you need a small reserve in your account. In the event things go the opposite of what you wanted, the market (bitfinex) forces you to sell your position so that + your reserve can pay back whatever you own. This way the people offering the lends don't take on much risk.
TLDR the people who bought bitcoin on borrowed USD were forced to sell them (and cover their losses from their reserve), so the lenders don't lose out. 1 person sell, price goes down a bit, another one sells, so on...

My biggest worry is that the fear of a hard-fork will cause bitcoin to stagnate. 
Version 1 of any software won't be anywhere near perfect. This applies to bitcoin as well, and now that we've seen it used in the wild for quite some time we noticed some things can be improved... like segwit. If the community decides to ignore the large amount of work that was put into this rather simple change, then I fear they'll ignore any other change attempt 'till bitcoin becomes an old relic. 
And it's not just the lightning network that they'd miss on, but think how much this is going to affect the developers. They put a ton of effort into making a change that improves the design and consequently allow shiny new features to be built on top. And then all their work is thrown in the bin because of a political decision that the old way is best... Those developers or the companies hiring them will eventually stop putting any more work into this. I'm not saying we should blindly accept changes that involved a lot of work. But we shouldn't dismiss them because of a fear that it will negatively affect the short term.

But for you to exchange gold for stuff you need an ecosystem where gold is valuable. Similarly to exchange the bitcoins locked by your private key you need an ecosystem where bitcoin is valuable (bitcoiners + blockchain + miners + clients). 
Since both ecosystems are distributed (though bitcoin is less popular), owning the private key is more akin to holding physical gold than gold certificates. For certificates you're gated by a single entity.

As I understand the problem with lending notes is that they can not be traded outside of the bank, when you make BTCnotes they are a different currency than BTC, that is if you lend someone 200 BTC they will actually have to be real BTC in order for the transactions to work on the Bitcoin client.
Edit for clarity: If you have 100 BTC and lend someone 1000 BTCnotes the person will only have 100 BTC avalable to trade at anyone point which defeats the purpose of the lending process. As the person borrowed will want to use all of the BTCnotes now not latter (or else he would've borrowed only 100 BTCnotes).
With money, the bank are kind of spending those 100 dollars they have 10 times with the promise that sometime in the future things will work out. While this problem has been solved in the Bitcoin client/network.

But the current alternative is proof of work, which is really similar except for the global warming part. So it's basically as fair as that, not to mention that rich people can buy more efficient hardware, so it's actually stacked in their favour. 
In essence proof of stake means you lock some amount of value and get the opportunity to confirm blocks. If you're found to have fraudulently signed blocks (by continuing a minority chain) you lose your profits and part of your deposit.  Same principle as proof of work, where you lock money via buying specialized hardware and consuming electricity.
The amount of value you lock in corresponds to how much security you provide the network. So it's fair to reward proportional to your deposit. Same as rewarding proportional to hash rate.
And if you think it's fairer to ask people to put work in vs just sitting on their money, then ask what is the purpose of either of them.

Clients can just store the hashes of orphaned blocks since they won't need transactions from them, and it's unlikely there will be a big fork.
Archive nodes will obv want to store everything, but they'll have the capacity.
But yeah, bandwidth required will increase, as everyone still has to store a few orphaned blocks until the main chain is confidently determined.

Do the invalidated transactions get erased from the network, or do they get reprocessed by the main blockchain when the next miner solves a block after reconnection?
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:20:52
The miners don't need to actually keep the ledger though. Every full client though has a copy of the ledger and they also process transactions by acting as nodes in the network. When a majority of Bitcoin users are defined as financial institutions I think there is something wrong with it's definition.

Because you'd be assisting the world a lot more than the drawbacks of more efficient organised crime.
(on a side note: even that assistance of organised crime may actually reduce violence in society since they don't have to deal with physical money and the process is much simpler and as such a lot less people are drawn into the crime ring. And they are not inclined to be violent when they don't need to carry guns around but just a computer.)
Also you'd be hard pressed to find widespread inventions that haven't assisted organised crime. Cars, phones, guns, encryption, they are all used by organised crime. But society gains so much more from these that they being used for crime is a minor inconvenience.

Most people he's talking about don't understand bitcoin, which is why he's pointing it out.
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:45:53
But I still don't understand how does this prevent centralization? Let's compare these cases: 1. segwit activates and the block size (including witness) averages to an effective 2MB or 2. the block size simply gets increased to 2MB (with max transaction size still 1MB to hack around O(n^2) problem).
So as far as I can tell, if your client wants to handle all transactions you'll still have to download (and share with the network) 2MB per block in either case. How could segwit put more transactions in the 2MB block than a pure blocksize increase?
Now I understand that segwit is a soft-fork and therefore you only need to process 1MB blocks with the old client. However old clients wouldn't be able to handle segwit transactions and therefore can't do lightning channels. I think it's reasonable to expect main-chain transaction costs to increase if the lightning network gets used, because we'd have more users in total (obviously the transactions in a channel will each be individually cheap). So then a poor users wants to use bitcoin, he must use segwit/lightning channels otherwise transaction costs will be too expensive, and therefore he has to run a new client which has to download all witness data. So I can't see how we're saving the poor user from requiring double the amount of bandwidth. 
That said please correct any wrong assumptions I made, thanks.

Since everyone is downvoting you for good reason, here's why:
You don't get bitcoin faster, as in more bitcoins per mining time then with any other mining pool. You get a small bit every hour (which i doubt you can even take out that often) compared to a larger bit every day for even the smaller pools.

Live linux cd would still be a good idea though, it's not terribly hard to do, and you only need to burn the cd once. Also as long as you only connect to the wallet websites you shouldn't be able to get any viruses. Hell you can even disconnect your hard drive. 
Get electrum, generate a wallet, write the seed down (don't bother with printing, some printers store everything that's ever been printed on them). Then memorize it for perfect security (and if you're worried about forgetting the key you can use shamir secret sharing then you can hide those keys in different places, you can even give some to friends (since you'll need x out of n keys to find your secret, if you give them to x-1 friends, they can never find the secret without you)). This also solves the issue with change addresses that a lot of people have.

The volatility is a huge problem but I can't see anyway it can be overcome while still allowing bit coin to grow. Bear in mind that by its nature it can't be pegged by anything.
However there are relatively stable periods between the peaks (still too volatile by most standards, but it allows for some short term predictability).
Taking volatility aside, have you ever thought about bit coins being the risk averse option for a lot of 3rd world countries. A lot of African countries probably have worse financial policies than just letting the free market work. Since bit coin would require just a phone to operate it might be very attractive to isolated areas since they won't pay the 10% fee [citation needed] of going through an intermediary.
And there's also issues like what's happening in Argentina, where people might prefer transitioning straight to a universal currency (bitcoin or other) rather than to another country's one.
Now bit coin in 3rd world countries won't need as big a market cap as the western world would need but it would provide a base for the exchange price.
@_date: 2013-11-14 18:45:52
And there will also be more more and more transactions happening which will lower the fee. They accumulate to less than 1btc right now though, so it's not that big of a deal.
It's about the default fee in the client which is keeping the fees artificially high, Gavin has been working on it apparently and I hope it will come in the next release.

Yeah, we can only reliably know the size of the visible universe which is just (speed of light) * (age of universe).
You might be wondering how can we get a value for the age of the universe if time is relative (remember time dilation). Well you can get different times from different reference frames but there is a maximum to this, and we take that as the age. Also the frame in which this time is the maximum is also the frame in which the cosmic microwave background is most uniform (red/blue shifted uniformly), so it's essentially a frame stationary to the universe.

I was curious on old printers that don't save your files on them. But the driver might save a temporary image on your computer, which could be easily targeted for by viruses.
Assume a fresh OS install so no software keyloggers (or screen capture for that matter). For physical keyloggers then you should also be worried for physically compromised printers.
The thing with encrypting a particular wallet is that it offers a very low reward for very significant effort (again, assuming strong password). I don't know about the NSA stuff, I'd assume wallets can use different elliptic curve parameters (I don't actually know what this means).

For a private key it will require 52*37 (number of letters+ numbers) tries which is very doable for computer. This is all assuming you have exactly one wrong number in it.

Well for one, the scammers aren't stupid so they won't just cash out 40k bitcoins in one go. If they even out their sell orders we might not even notice since the current daily volume on the exchanges is ~70k bitcoins (bitcoinaverage.com).
But all the exchanges require you to verify your details, I very much doubt they would even try to cash out from a regular exchange. So cashing out through some other means would barely influence the price at all since the trade never goes public and in the end someone else is holding the bitcoins (this is based on how I understood big trades to take place).

Again keeping the extreme case, he buys $1000 worth of bitcoins. His loses are now at most $0, because the bet covers him if bitcoins go to 0, and since he bought bitcoins at less then $1000/btc he has more money then he needs to pay out in case he loses the bet. So this strategy has 0 risk of losing money, but there's some variability in his winnings.
My question is: at perfect hedging, how much profit does he make? (I assume at perfect hedging the payoff is unique.)

I fell into this trap myself, but actually when you only need to modify 1 letter the brute force tries only add up instead of multiply.

You could get a comparison between flops and sha256 by counting how many transistors/gates/size on chip it takes to do them.

Ok I don't exactly know what's happening but I've seen it posted before by LukeJr, and in a few more places.
To receive money you need the public address, which is the hardest to crack part. However when you send money to someone you have to sign the transaction with your private key. This is the hard to crack part but quantum computing can speed the algorithm to crack it quite significantly, furthermore there's a reduction in it's complexity the more times you sign transactions with the same private key.
This is my ELI5 understanding of it, but basically when you sign something with your private key the signature becomes vulnerable to quantum computing attacks.

Secure bitcoin memory stick wallet os:
-compact version of linux (with graphical interface, and encryption)
-a few wallets pre installed
-extremely limited networking (you can connect to the internet but no program/script received can ever be run)
-extremely limited web-browsing. Same as above, a browser sandboxed enough that it can't compromise the system. Only way to get data out is to copy-paste, and only bitcoin like addresses are allowed to be copy-pasted. This is so you can pay for things that you want to buy.
-secured in such a way that any modifications would compromise it. (this is the trickiest part, might be possible if you can create a mini-os that decrypts the data, prove this mini-os is the smallest possible program and have the encrypted main os start exactly after it)
[extending on this idea, assume it's possible in the future to have memory sticks with some exact nr of bytes on them such that you can install this thing on it and be sure that it can't run if it's modified]

Yes, almost.
Bitcoin is the total set of rules that define it, any change in those rules creates a Changed-coin. If 80% of clients chose (for some reason) to change to Changed-coin the original Bitcoin will still continue to function with just 20% clients.
The new value of the networks is mindbending to calculate. But for a simple model assume that 80% of nodes correspond to 80% of people using bitcoin which would correspond to 80% of the market cap. Then the Changed-coin will have a total market cap equal to that 80% of value. But because it honours 100% of past transactions, that means that 100% of the original people have access to it. Which means your value in that network instantly dilutes. Same for the original-coin. Mind you each person can now access both networks at the same time. Also that instant the sum of the value of both networks equals the old value, but will mostly likely go fuck itself because of the massive confusion that just happened.

A rebuttal to nr. 2: the saving grace for Bitcoin is its simplicity. Satoshi's paper is only 9 pages long, it can be read and understood in one day. The algorithm used to verify transactions is included in it, and the cryptographic proof has been thoroughly verified by mathematicians. Basically the entire security portion of the network is orders of magnitude simpler to implement then Windows and is also possible to be implemented bug free.
This of course still leaves room for bugs in more complicated code, which will eventually be exploited. However those exploits will be viewed as failure of company X to have good code rather then failure of Bitcoin. (provided we move away from the current Mt Gox monopoly or others that may emmerge)
@_date: 2013-11-18 00:09:16
The clients also have to accept it.
If a fork occurs there will be 2 versions of bitcoin incompatible with eachother. The inflation miners will mine the inflation-bitcoin and the original miners will mine the original-bitcoin. At that moment clients will only be able to trade within their own version, at which point if people aren't somehow forced into switching clients (some sort of law) most will rationally chose the original chain. At which point the miners that wanted to inflate bitcoin will have created a very secure alt-coin that no one uses.
@_date: 2013-04-30 20:47:12
The design of Bitcoin allows the change to a better hashing algorithm. Vulnerabilities in the hashing functions should be theorized long before an actual crack is found, which would leave enough time to switch. Of course that may not always happen, but then you will only have to outrun the campers as the other said until the switch is made. (in this situation bitcoin will lose quite a lot of value though, but likely not to 0)

I am similarly optimistic about Bitcoin but there is one problem that may stop this. Mt Gox, and the other exchanges may not be able to handle the viral increase, and there will not be enough time for others to gain enough trust and rise above.
I think we will hit a plateau (and maybe a decrease) around $500/BTC and the viral increase will resume after another 2-6 months when the exchanges catch up and the media picks the story up again.

No. The 24 words are chosen at random to give you a completely random 256 bit number which is what the private key is. 
When making a brain wallet a person usually chooses a few words and those words are not as strong as random words since the brain isn't very good at generating random patterns. Also we have a tendency to pick up phrases from books or actually chose the entire password from a book which computers can go through thus making it insecure.

And they may even value their identity tied to transactions (when you're paying back loans, to improve credit rating). However that transaction does not stop someone else from making a separate anonymous transaction.

Rewards could be set backwardly. As in the current block will distribute the rewards to the x-th block before it and all it's orphaned blocks in a fair way. Preferably equal reward distribution while splitting transaction fees individually based on who included the transaction in their block.
There are 2 consequences of this that I see:
1. You can have miners adding late blocks to previous nodes and taking a chunk of the reward, but this arguably increases the confidence in that block and thus contributes to securing the blockchain.
2. Miners will be incentivized to include a lot more transactions in their blocks since if they're block gets orphaned then they can only get a share of the fees if they included them. This also doesn't make miners rush their block distribution (and thus not including transactions) since all the blocks even if orphaned get a the same reward.

I am not saying we should stop using Bitcoin, for the next 10 years bitcoin will probably be the only contender actually and that's good, it's still much more efficient then the current system.
Satoshi isn't perfect, he had a brilliant idea, and the idea is good enough to change the world, but it's not perfect. What I implied is that in the long run (think 50 years) we will switch to a better system. And the switch will be orders of magnitude easier since there is a way to directly convert bitcoin into a different cryptocurrency without the need for the very long build up of trust. 
(By that i imagine you can use the feature of releasing a payment only if n out of m addresses agree, where m can be the totality of people in the new currency, this way you can have the new currency based directly on top of bitcoin. The actual way is obviously more complicated, but i feel like it can be made possible.)

There is a bit of confusion on what a 51% attack is in this thread.
51% attack: miners follow the same rules but chose to not include certain transactions and include others
Lets say A pays B in block 15 with a 51% attack the new block will also be block 15 but here A paid C (call this block 15C). The honest miners will continue block 15B and produce 16B where A paying B has 2 confirmations, the 51% guys continue with block 16C. Because the 51% guys can produce blocks faster than the honest people, they will end up with the longest chain which is the one the clients follow. Note all blocks follow the same rules, we're just modifying destinations of transactions. (this whole process is a soft-fork)
When we miners decide on a higher block reward, a hard-fork occurs. Honest miners will continue on the honest chain which will be shorter, but this time the clients can distinguish between the 2 chains for themselfs. They will notice the inflation chain doesn't follow the same rules and will chose to ignore it. No matter how much power the new chain has, the clients will completely ignore it and continue watching the honest chain.

Opportunity cost. Which is a pretty close to a null risk.
But now I want to point out that bitcoin doesn't aim to solve the problem of wealth inequality. Its aim is to give the control of wealth back to the people, among other things.
Now to morality. Why is a good CEO worth 100000 more than a street cleaner? They are both humans. Now you may argue that the CEO provides a much greater service to humanity, which is true. But then why is that CEO still worth 1000 more than a very very very good scientist. They are now of the same value to humanity, but one of them handles money and one handles knowledge. And as a society we made the choice to reward the one that handles money disproportionately more than any other class. In view of that, what is wrong with rewarding the first people to adopt a revolutionary idea disproportionately more than late comers. 
(This assumes bitcoin becomes huge, and the first adopters will be huge. Otherwise this discussion doesn't make much sense, since there won't be any big shift of wealth.)

I am actually curious if they can be bundled in the same transaction as well, otherwise it ends up in an infinite series of transactions.
If the item is lost in shipping, then the seller can refund the buyer, at which point he will release the funds to also get his insurance back. However someone has to take a loss in the case of a lost package, which is why you generally want a 3rd party to mediate these transactions and preferably also take the risk of lost packages.

I don't know this part.
I think (but am not certain) that each client that stores the blockchain verifies that the miners are doing a proper job, so to modify the rules implies that the majority of clients (not miners) agree to the new rules.
Alas I would like someone to explain me this as well.

His arguing that orphaned blocks equally contribute to the security of the blockchain. 
The only reason Satoshi didn't make the confirmation time very short was because he didn't have a solution to the orphaned blocks problem, which is what the paper presents. Having this solution to the problem is major difference between his proposal and fastcoin style.

Same thing applies if you encrypt a wallet properly. If you create it and encrypt it on an offline computer it's as secure as printing the wallet from that offline computer. You can then make the encrypted wallet public and no one will break it (provided a strong enough password).
What do you mean by electronic trail?
@_date: 2013-04-21 19:55:17
As I can see it, mining costs would have to be comparable for the network to provide adequate security. The reason is if the market gets big enough then it will be proportionally more profitable for an attack.
I don't know exactly about "proportionally" but I see no reason why it shouldn't increase linearly.

I think they could, and that may prove to be an interesting point in the future. However that means that the majority would agree to lose 1/3 of their value due to inflation, which from a logical standpoint shouldn't happen.
An interesting side effect arises in that producing more coins would indirectly reduce fees, since miners would again have 2 sources of income. Where the secondary income comes from inflation.
This may actually be beneficial for the top x% of transaction makers, where x depends on few factors, but it's highly unlikely that x% will be larger then 50%, so there won't be any point at which it's reasonable for the network to create more coins.

You are correct. But what you said does not contradict what I said, and I feel that you've missed the point. The intrinsic value of gold is waaaay lower then it's monetary value. It just provides a bottom line for the value of gold, which again is pretty low, whereas bitcoin has a bottom line of 0.
The bulk of both gold and bitcoins value lies in societies trust in them. So much so, that the intrinsic value of gold can be neglected in respect to it's monetary value.

And we'd also go in to chaos for a few decades, but that's another story.
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:55:17
That is a very wrong argument. The reason bitcoin gained value in the first place is because of its superior features to other currencies. If bitcoin takes hold over the dollar/euro/whatever, then its entirely reasonable for a different currency to surpass it in the future.
However the lesser advantages a different currency provides the longer it will take.

Yes but the US needs to be able to reach you at the end destination or in transit to be able to act on it. They can't reach you in Spain, so it becomes a problem of moving your stash.
With gold you have to physically transport it to Spain which would be very noticeable but with a brain wallet your indistinguishable from a poor tourist.
Also the nature of bitcoin makes it pretty easy to backtrack after you spend something, but you wouldn't do that until you reach a safe point.

Not quite. Imagine a photon in the cosmic microwave background, it's traveled from the edge of the visible universe to us, and it must have traveled c*age of universe. This is the furthest object we can observe from our visible universe.
It's confusing to think about the edge of the universe because the "now" at the edge for us happens when a photon arrives on Earth. However the image that you have in your head includes things from which the light hasn't reached us yet and thus in our "future". Some of these objects may move outside the visible universe before we ever observe them because of the universe's expansion.
Hmm, lets imagine you have a very bright star/galaxy/thing near (not on it) the edge that has been there since the start. At the beginning it was moving slowly away from us because there was a small distance between us (and the rate of expansion depends on distance), so light from it could reach us. Now (in our now) we see it right at the edge of the universe, and at this moment (for us) the object is moving at speed c away from us because of expansion, in a few moments it disappears because the universe will be expanding at more than c between us. (of course in its frame of reference this event happened billions of years ago) (and because of relativity of time they will think the same of us [when we disappear, they will say that in our reference frame the event happened billions of years ago])
Basically the visible universe expands at constant speed, but the real universe expands uniformly (so the rate increases with distance). Also there must have been a moment at the beginning when the visible universe was getting bigger faster than the expansion of the real universe. Now I think objects 13 billion light years away from us are moving away from us faster than light (because the space between us is increasing, but light from them moves at c through space and it will never reach us).

In which case we should definitely push for wallets to not save data on disk until an encryption option is presented.
Since I'm using Electrum, I don't like the steps order when creating a new wallet. seed -&gt; confirm seed -&gt; (save to disk? why?) -&gt; connect to server -&gt; encrypt (why encrypt after connecting to server?)
Better series would be seed-&gt;seed confirmation-&gt;encryption-&gt;save to disk-&gt;connect to server (including option to stay offline)

Yes sort of.
I was thinking that any big buyer would want to buy the coins anyway. Given the opportunity they would buy off market at a cheaper price, but they would still hold on to them for a while.
Such that it doesn't end up lowering the price but rather not raising the price, since there is one less buyer on the market.
Obviously increased demand raises prices and decreased demand  will lower them over the long term, but the question was about short term price fluctuations.

I hate this line of thinking. You want bitcoin to be usable by the average human. The average human does not have any sort of coding skills, nor any idea how to even post a bounty for that feature, nor a significant enough bounty for the feature to be implemented even if they do post a bounty.
In this case the average user posted his opinion on a forum and his opinion was reinforced by a lot of other people that it reached the front page of r/bitcoin.
The average users want this feature and that alone should increase its priority even though none of those that want it know how to code it or even care enough to post a bounty for it.

You can. With electrum for example you are given a 12 word seed when you create a wallet. You can then install electrum on another computer/phone and do file-&gt;open-&gt;chose a new file-&gt;restore from seed. Now you have the same wallet on 2 devices.
It's possible with most other, but the process may be more complicated and I don't actually know so I can't say more about it.

If Bitcoin gets big enough I see new banks appearing that specifically deal with bitcoins in that they store, insure and loan them out for you, while they will also provide some hardware that is some form of secure mini wallet that can only be hacked if it's gained access to.
So basically the bank give you a thing that has at most 10BTC in it and the rest is stored in the bank and you trust the bank to keep it secure for you, while you can keep your 10 portable BTC secure for yourself by holding on the little thing, which may possibly be insured (although this opens up fraud opportunities) so that the bank refunds you in case it gets stolen.
This will obviously cater to the least common denominator and it doesn't defeat the decentralization principle as anyone can still be fully autonomous if they chose so.

If gold would stop being a currency then it would lose it's value tenfold, at least.
It's impossible to use anything as currency while keeping it valued at it's utility point. The moment you use something as currency you have to pause using it for its utility while the good is being exchanged or stored. When you do that, supply and demand will dictate a higher value than it's utility value.
You might say that the value of any currency is intrinsic to a society and not to any single human. And that value fluctuates with trust ease of use and all the other traits of currency as viewed from the perspective of the entire society.

I wonder what he would think of ppcoin. It solves the problem of wasted resources. The mining in ppcoin goes strictly to confirming transactions and securing the network without having to spend energy on proof of vote.
I have a feeling something similar to it will be the main cryptocurrency of the future just because it allows for the lowest transaction fees without any other consequences. (note that inflation is not a necessary, you can still reward mining with transaction fees)
Alas until the future comes all viable cryptocurrencies will be strongly correlated since it's so easy to go from one to the other but it's hard to go from fiat to digital. Only after they take hold will the most efficient currency prevail.

Although it's fair to bash the miners for this a bit. The point of bitcoin is to expect everyone to be greedy and work around it.
There is a solution for the betting site against this: put the money in escrow or a conditional transaction (i know they're possible but don't know the details) and wait for more than a few confirmations.
Also don't allow very high reward bets depending on the number of confirmations you wait for. As sue-dough-nim points out, there's a 5% chance of ghash.io getting 6 blocks in a row, then don't allow 6 confirmation bets that have a 20x payoff such that any miner attempting this will incur loses on average.

The update will leave enough time for everyone to update so that the situation is 98% of clients updated. Otherwise yes it will cause a split.
If bitcoins go mainstream the update time may be in terms of years 1-5 years before the changes take effect, which leaves plenty of time for the word to go around, not to mention that people that are usually technologically incompetent will deal with bitcoins through a 3rd party (online wallet or some other things that may appear in the future) so they won't be left behind.

No, the public key can be safely kept public. 
Signing with the private key exposes it to risk. And that's why new private keys are generated and your change goes into them. The risk can be mitigated completely by what the client does currently.
Also bitcoin is future compatible, if in the future there is a suggestion that sha 256 may be broken, bitcoin can change to a different hashing algo.

Ok, I just created a new electrum wallet and it does save a file before the encryption phase, but the same file is overwritten after encryption. Which I would assume is put in the same place in memory, thus erasing all past data (I am not sure on this).
But are you sure your computer doesn't save a temporary file before printing? That would also leave an electronic trace.
On this note, I think we should push for wallet software to provide an encryption option before saving a file to disk (so no trace is left). I'd also welcome if some people can say if printer drivers ever save temporary files, and how to go about erasing those.
(Also you can distribute the encrypted wallet to as many places as you want since the principles behind it's security are the same as the one's behind bitcoin's security.)

"He has no idea of the priorities of the developers" this is my point.
