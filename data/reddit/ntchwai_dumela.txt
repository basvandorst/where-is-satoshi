I’m hesitant, recovering from lower and lower prices takes longer.
  Edit: For if it goes below 6-7k

I reported him the other day for trolling. Very counter productive and never any credible information..
@_date: 2018-03-23 23:21:02
I'm out at 8725, I got nervous at your post earlier!- as I got in in the same position. It'll probably go up a bit more, cuz bitcoin. Didn't look like the upwards momentum I thought there was gong to be. This weekend should be interesting.

Wow thanks, I’m at work and didn’t even get to read his comment, he deleted it so fast. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 18:42:43
I’d hazzard a guess, people who believe in it as a future currency. You dropped $$$ on a few S9s and you don’t believe in it?
@_date: 2018-03-15 16:45:08
You realize, other than transaction cost, the price per coin has nothing to do with peoples ability to afford it, right?
@_date: 2018-03-21 16:20:42
I guess you’re right 100% of the time if you delete your posts and post right after the action
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:57:15

I’m perfectly comfortable watching the market and keeping out. Things looking real fishy rn, feels good to not buy relatively high, then bitting my nails given recent prices. FOMO, what’s that?
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:20:51
Don't know if going up, or if we are waiting for the usual morning slump...

If you guys see the troll(s) on here please report. It’s terrible to see this sub decend to nonsense.
@_date: 2018-03-28 16:23:37
Yeah no shit that’s why I said it’s not very utilitarian. The point is blockchain can be taken and used in more than just transaction ledgers and that’s part of the value. 
The fact that the tech is open source is huge to entrepreneurs and creators.
  Edit: Blockchain tech isn’t gonna do any cartwheels to get the price moving for you...
@_date: 2018-03-21 13:50:41
To make an assessment of the current/future situation and be 100% spot on is pretty good. Between your last posts you’ve make several speculations from whale activity, how far down it’ll go because of whales, a correction based on market cap, whale activity based on said correction, to inexperienced trader activity.
 That’s a lot of speculative variables. How do you know news won’t come out sending the price down a hole to which we’d be stuck in for any given period of time?

Take a second and look at which users are posting sound opinions... I’ll give you the benefit of the doubt you maybe have been watching these threads longer than your week old account.

Goto 
  
  You can find which exchange bitcointicker.co is pulling the price from. It should also say which exchange is being used to quote the price on the top right above the %change on bitcointicker

He probably doesn't know it but there are *sites* that archive deleted posts on reddit.

Is that a thing? I’ve noticed people saying they’re in for the tech.. Other than reading the white paper and seeing how blockchain works, hard to imagine they are here for any other reason than to invest or use btc in transactions in an activist manner.

He’s an attention seeker with plenty of free time. Enough free time that he’d probably use another account or make a new one just to troll people if we banned him. He’s been doing it for months trolling hodlers and deleting posts. Would you name your first Reddit account sh*tberger?
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:41:01
Not very utilitarian because not everyone wants to bother submitting their vin numbers to a database but, vincoin/vinchain.
@_date: 2018-04-17 19:26:31
What is the point for fudsters. They cant possibly think their comments on Reddit will sway the market. If they’re no coiners they’re just the “old man yelling at millennials” to get a fix (pissing vinegar and discouraging anything new)... I don’t get it
