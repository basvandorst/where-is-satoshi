I doubts stocks are going to crash for at least a couple of years because of the lift on corporate taxes. Should be very Bull for a while longer... then, devastating crash because it climbed too high without a real correction.

Sry. I just put in an order at $9970

Day traders are the ones that provide the liquidity for the market. Without liquidity, you’d have way fewer investors.

Except Coinbase will likely take months to respond.
Chances are Coinbase's system is just bogged down due to the influx of users and you'll have your deposit/purchase processed very soon. 
Side note: did you get a confirmation email for when you spent your money?

But seriously, what's the difference? Coinmarketcap says the name is MIOTA but the symbol is IOTA?? Are they actually the same coin or did they mess up the naming?

This is what I came here to say. Having been both a liberal and a conservative at different points in my life, what you said exactly reflects my core beliefs at those times.

Hey, you dropped this:

I just gave you a history lesson, and you had nothing of substance to say in response. I think one of us is more likely than the other to have done his research.

This is a scam! I only see two wheels!

This is the explanation I was looking for.  Thanks!

John Wilkes Booth's hero - and his favorite character to play as an actor - was Brutus, the man who orchestrated the murder of Caesar. And, interestingly, "Brutus" was also his fathers name: Junius Brutus Booth. 
I don't think this was a government conspiracy. It was basically written in the stars that JWB was going to murder a president, whether or not it was Lincoln.

The adrenaline of seeing that Coinbase email from 2012 about my bank account confirmations, wondering how many Bitcoin my precocious 2012 self would have purchased at $13 apiece, fantasizing about what I'm going to do with all of my newfound wealth, realizing my dreams are finally coming true, thinking of ways I can treat my family and friends, .... Jittery happiness &amp; excitement that I haven't experienced since my middle school crush asked my shy, terrified self to dance at homecoming. 
Followed by an utterly, soul-crushing disappointment. 
I was so close.

That makes a lot of sense.... but why do they have so many coins? It sounds like it would be a bit unwieldy.

Or just sign up in your parent's name and don't him/her. ID verification is required before you withdraw money - so only ask them to verify ID *after* you've already made a ton of money. I'm sure they'll forgive you after seeing what you've accomplished. 
And if you lose all your money, then you never have to tell them :)

Nice! What's her name?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:18:01
CORRECTION: It was only $13 back then!!! Even my then-poor self would have bought 10 of these and forgotten about it until now.

RemindMe! Of this in 1 year

Wait, what do you mean limit orders don't have fees?? What exchange do you use?
