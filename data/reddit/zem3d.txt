Generally, I think that Ethereum by its actual usefulness as both a currency (transfers in seconds for next to nothing, and is much more liquid) and development platform makes it a better application of blockchain technology. I think this is echoed by the very large volume of development (namely the EEA) centered around the ethereum network. Another good application is Power ledger. That's not to say that BTC is a "bad blockchain", but its far from being in a position to be the absolute and only alternative to traditional financial entities.

Nobody smart saying that bitcoin crashing would move the money back to banks. It’s not in a vacuum, and the undeniable technology is the blockchain, which bitcoin is far from being the best application of it available.

As if a string of seemingly jibberish is any different.

The market is currently Concentrated around Mt.Gox, the Biggest Bitcoin Exchange. It currently does 80% of the trades. ''Hackers'' yse this as a weak link by Slowing it down using a Distributed Denial of Service Attack (DDoS). During the Laggy period, the Hackers use Thousands of bots to do tiny transactions at a loss, bringing the price down and causing panic, making speculators sell too, giving the hackers the possibility to buy cheap and sell back higher again.
At least, that's what they used to do weekly, don't know about what happened yesterday.

You stick tabs to the side of your monitor and it slides behind those.
