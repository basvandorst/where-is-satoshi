Wait, so 20% of your total savings is held in bitcoin? Or 40% (initial investment x2)? Either way, that's incredibly risky from a diversity standpoint and it makes no sense to hold that much in one thing.

Well, the US gov has never defaulted on paying out on Treasury bills. Kind of why T-bills are the standard for risk-free investment (apart from inflation risk). And the US gov has many tools to control currency, while bitcoin on the other hand...

Fair enough :) Just pointing out that it might be useful to think the same way about market investment.

To be fair, 8 years is a very short time-frame for analyzing an 'investment'. We don't know enough about it to compare it to investing in market securities (which have empirical evidence to back up general market improvement consistently over the long-term). And if short term investment is the goal, the volatile spikes don't indicate good things either.

I guess my point still stands. If you're investing for short term gains, the volatility makes it a bad idea, as it may fall greatly in the short term. And 8 years isn't long enough to understand long-term investing. 


I'm confused on what this means by 'market share.' Do you mean as it grows as a usable 'currency' in stores, etc.? I was under the impression that the trend wasn't growing as fast anymore? Isn't much of the value of Bitcoin derived from more people trying to buy it, rather than the development of it as a payment system? I know that's what concerns many people.

To be fair, if you're talking about making money, it would be more useful to compare 1) purchasing bitcoin with 2) investing in e.g. an index fund. Rather than comparing purchasing a bitcoin and buying dinner.
