By buying Bitcoin and talking about it you are helping the Bitcoin network become bigger and more well known.
Maybe for you and me Bitcoin is not a necessary thing, but just look at the people in Venezuela or other countries where the local currency has high inflation. Bitcoin is awesome for those people.

Nasa is a smokescreen for the secret black budget space program.
This is also the reason why you now hear a lot about Flat Earth; it's a psyop to associate people that question Nasa with the Flat Earth idiots.

What exactly do you want to know?
You can use electrum to import your private key and that way you can use your coins from the paper wallet.

Didn't Buffet say he didn't like Bitcoin?
