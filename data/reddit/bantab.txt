They can only dump for any appreciable time when there are large barriers to entry, which for the most part take the form of government regulations.

I don't think this would do anything for the scripts that the sock puppets use.

If the private doesn't have funds, how do you prevent someone from neglecting to pay the account that might automatically pay them?
Edit: for clarity

In your edited solution, where the private key of the fee is broadcast with the transaction, what is to prevent an entity from claiming the fee without passing on the message? It seems that setup needs trust on one side or the other.
As an aside, the radio broadcast is probably less private than an Internet connection, and also would make it easier to associate a transaction with a physical location.

I edited above to make it more clear. It seems there is still a trust issue, unless you have a way to confirm an escrow account that contains the automatic payment funds.

Ah, this makes sense. How would a transaction output pay the key without releasing the payment information beforehand?

While the enforcement of this registration error seems to be legal, choosing to enforce it in this case in the manner that they have is a clear signal about the attitude of the fed towards bitcoin. Enforcement is always coupled with discretion.

The current situation reinforces the need for more efficient mechanisms to short bitcoin. Coinsetter should be interesting.

The argument, I believe, is on the point of the falsehood in the registration. If the bitcoin is a gift card (under prior supposition), then money is transmitted to refund the card, but the money was not necessarily transferred "on behalf of the public." The money could be remitted as a normal business practice, just as Amazon might refund someone for a gift card. I don't believe Amazon is required to register as a "money transmitting business" for this function, so there is grey area on the registration.
On the other hand, they are currently operating as an "unlicensed money transmitting business," so the registration is irrelevant.

It'll be interesting to see if part of their own argument (that bitcoin is not fiat currency) damages the whole (that, as currency, the exchange is subject to these regulations). I don't know the relevant law well enough, but I would think there's an argument to be made.

In I don't think most folks interested in crypto-currency are huge fans of the government...

I'm surprised so many people missed the parody. "Magical free doctors" makes it quite apparent.

It's an important and non-trivial distinction. There are benefits to being government-recognized money, and there are benefits to not being government-recognized money. On the other hand, there are huge drawbacks to allowing the government to classify btc as one or the other depending on how it suits them. We should not be so willing to give them latitude in this distinction.

This warrant doesn't have to do with virtual currency, it has to do with improper registration. Whether the warrant was sought because of a desire to harass a virtual currency purveyor is another matter.
