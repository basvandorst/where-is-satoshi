I think it's possible we don't know all the facts. Possibly Mark is unable to because of gag order. Best to know all the facts before making a full judgement.

I mean the 180K. Did we know he still had control over this many coins?

Look how many people are still buying Goxcoins for ~$80/BTC. Actually giving up their own BTC for Goxcoins after the announcement.

Large companies can have complex internal systems, especially around billing. Having worked with several, it's surprising how expensive it is to change and make improvements. Possibly they don't see the roi just yet and they have larger engineering needs. Not supporting btc isn't a vote against it. There are. Slid reasons a big company might not accept btc even if they want to.

Did we know that mtgox recently had control over this many coins? Or is this news in itself?

Just the surface of what can be visualized from MtGox - hope you guys keep going. Excellent work

What if the missing coins are a part of a larger gov't seizure? 
@_date: 2014-09-15 19:34:43
$20 done.

Maybe only some accounts affected?

City's convention center making Bitcoin front and center to spread crytocurrency awareness to visitors. The city’s first Bitcoin ATM, provided by CoinVault ATM, is not sitting in a small coffee shop; instead, it is located just outside of Starbucks in one of Houston’s more frequented buildings: The George R. Brown Convention Center.
Came home to Texas for the holidays and saw this on the front page of business section. Very nice, Houston.
