This is called "dust". It'll most likely just be ignored and never retrieved. You could induce a protocol to get rid of them via some authority check but that would never be accepted and IMO ruin bitcoin. It'll just be lost and increase the value due to it. It'd be like taking a chunk of gold and sending it to space.

I have not, because I'm smart enough not to use them.
What I'm saying, and what you don't seem to be getting, is that Coinbase is vastly inferior to any other exchange. The good are immensely outweighed by the bad.
Coinbase is allowed to shutdown your account for any reason without notice, effectively stealing your bitcoin, most exchanges are allowed to but Coinbase is the one most actively doing so. 
@_date: 2016-12-10 12:16:11

Typing in the adress manually? Chances are incredibly small but there still is one. Someone could also try to frame you.

Send a ticket to Kraken saying that you've received some funds that aren't yours and you don't know where they came from.
Could be someone "accidentally"  sending to the wrong address even though that chance is small.
Edit: And as long as you make that post (and delete this one) I don't think they can actually prove it was you sending the btc since that can't prove it wasn't someone else sending to the wrong address either.

So far the only increase in price of BCH has been because of pump&amp;dump schemes, and the people behind it has continuously lied to their users/listeners. Doubt it'll go past BTC. If the "scaling solutions" for BTC fail people will just revert and figure out a better solution.

There's been way to many horror stories about how they just randomly shut down your account or take your coins. Always remember that unless you're the sole owner of the private keys you do not own the bitcoin.
Storing on any exchange is a bad idea but very much so on Coinbase.
Can't say anything about the charge though since I've never personally _dared_ to use them.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:56:18

This is why you don't store your btc on coinbase, now you'll *probably* get your coins back but their support and service has time and time again proven to be one of the worst. Numerous times have they stolen coins and just shut down accounts without notice..

lol, if you've never seen anything against Coinbase then this is obviously your first time here. There was even one dude dedicated to creating a list of all the reports of their shitty service. 
Most people even write on every topic about Coinbase that they suck. Most agree that Coinbase is terrible. Being on this sub pretty much constantly due to boredom and time available most posts about a shitty service is about Coinbase. Unlike coinbase you get your coin immediately and can get them out of there.
Unlike Coinbase kraken doesn't just close accounts stealing bitcoin, they don't do like what they've done to OP (even if this can be counted as a bug their support is better). 
Infact most posts about it how "kraken sucks" is from you?
But what can I expect from a Coinbase shill.

Okay so you have this pile of 4 legos. You also have 4 duplos identical to the legos (except the brand). Sure you have 8 "bricks" that both can be used but you still only have 4 legos. If a service requires you to give them legos you cannot give them duplos, you wouldn't then in their eyes **only have 4 bricks**.
Now say you want to exchange those duplos to legos. Now unlike "other" currency you cannot create legos. So to get more legos you will have to trade your duplos to a willing person who then gives you some of his legos. You would now have 6 legos and 2 duplos. And he would have 2 duplos. You never created more legos or duplos you just traded them.
 
Now you might say but why don't you just make more legos? Well you can't, the materials to make them have completely run out. But for duplos? You can create as MANY as you want. **BUT** there's a catch:
First 1 lego = 1 duplo. That's all there is, all is well.
Now you create 3 more duplos. This means that the supply of duplos has increased, but it's value has NOT. The lego hasn't changed its value it's still worth as much. But since there's now more duplos they aren't worth as much.
That means: 1 lego = 4 duplos.

In my uneducated opinion, both.
The price will most likely fall immediately before and or after the fork due to people panic selling. Then it'll climb up to a high due to people selling the new coin for BTC (and people selling BTC for the new coin but I doubt that would ever happen lmao).
