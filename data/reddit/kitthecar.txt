big players want to get in on bitcoin 
so they buy small amounts of bitcoin off exchange (off exchange prices are set by on exchage ie. btc-e Houbi etc.) 
They then sell this small amount (5,000 - 10,000) should do the trick on exchange causing panic selling !
Large off exchange orders are then placed 100,000 Plus Bitcoins and bought on the cheap (10%-40%) 
Couple this with a few hired shilles and you have a in on bitcoin on the cheap.
Good bitcoin news = price goes down = big players manipulating the price

You are right but if addressed now things will and can move along swiftly 
ie. 1 nmc = $ 3   Trademark names can be purchased for $3 
Generic names like Moviez.bit  sold for 11 NMC 
So (1) Namecoin needs business (2) Namecoin supports business
The Squatting thing is a issue but at $3 a name its nothing - 90% of the time its people who missed the boat or wrote namecoin off ? that bring up squatting o theres way to much squatting on ,com too
Anyhow if you are the right full owner and can prove it ie. Nike you will get the name for $3 
But say a generic name like Sex ? well thats a free market 
@_date: 2014-05-11 08:18:16

Gambling is Good for Bitcoin and the Price
The gambling industry pushes the envelope of technology and censorship resistance moving the bitcoin ecosystem forward
Bitcoins price will increase due to gambling volume
Bitcoin will take 2% of the gambling market within a year and 5% within 2 years
5% of $3 trillion is $150 billion, bitcoins current yearly transactions are $25 billion (see chart). 25 goes into 150 6 times pointing to bitcoin price increase of 600% to $3000 within 2 years

Nothing happened with Argentina's default last Wednesday hey....try 
Argentinian Peso lost 20% (over 1 week) 
Nasdaq                   -2%  
What happens in Argentina is supposed to stay in Argentina. But the country’s downward spiral into its second default in 13 years is causing U.S. investors to wonder what this could mean for global markets.
Already, the Argentine situation and other geopolitical turbulence have unnerved U.S. markets and interrupted what was looking like a smooth July. Stocks are now down for the month as investors digest what this latest worry means. The Dow Jones industrial average is down more than 200 points, in part, on mounting concerns about global worries.

Two options:
 
1) $10-20 trillion USD have to be extinguished via bank shutdown, Madoffization, closure of offshore accounts or plain assassinations. There are $80 trillion in existence
Issues is: Whose trillions? Who will be the victim?
I'd say offshore accounts will simply be shut down, computers unplugged and a couple of assassinations
 
2) Globalization dies. World sinks into chaos
 
I bet the first is about to happen.

 ... interesting times ahead .... the share price of Portugal's largest private lender, Banco Espirito Santo, dropped by more than 40% on Thursday after the bank posted a record loss of 3.6 billion for the first half of the year.
The troubled bank said "extraordinary events" had resulted in costs totalling 4.25bn euros during the period.
Bill Blain, chief strategist at Mint Partners, said the bank's loss is "deeply concerning" and could lead to a "reignition" of the sovereign debt crisis seen in Europe from 2010-12. BBC

Buy altcoins
Say China have banned bitcoin again or Russia 
Buy on multiple exchanges £1m x 8 exchanges over 3months then dump them and buy £492m worth off exchange . I call this move "snake eyes"

@_date: 2014-06-01 16:33:49
the best way to buy large numbers of coins and still keep the price down ...
1) multiple exchanges  
2) over a period of time 1-3 months 
3) circulate bad news (FUD)
4) flat lines = basing ie. A basing stock is also thought to be one that is forming new lines of support and resistance. In essence, basing is the merging of previous lines, which leads to the formation of different ones. Many technical analysts believe that basing is crucial, especially for surging stocks. They view basing as the "breather" that allows the issue to continue climbing.
