I trade options for my full time income. I usually just leg credit spreads into iron condors every 2.5 months. But, if I can already remember the highest point and the year, I can just buy extremely far OTM for $1 each, style.
I'm gunna spitball for a bit.
$TTD IPO'd in late 2016, and it hovered $22-$25 for a few months. It recently hit $290 this year.
Median American yearly income is around $36k. I would stash every penny away for this, but budget advice usually advises 10% saving rule. 
So that's $3.6k stashed from 2010 to 2016. That's $25.2k in 7 years. I'm not sure about historical options prices, but I'm pretty sure a $50 call 3 years out would be about $1. That would expect a 100% rise in the stock in 3 years. 
So load up on 25,200 $50 calls for $1 each. Assuming volume is too low to exit at $290, we can try to exit at $280 because it hovered there for a while. 
Then since each option is a contract for 100 stocks, you have control of 2,520,000 stocks. You bought a $50 contract, so each share has a net profit of $280 - $50 = $230. 
$230 profit on 2,520,000 shares is $579,600,000.  $TTD has 4.8 million shares outstanding, so it's possible.  So you'd make a little over half a billion in profit.
Luckily these prices are from the middle of this year, so it's pretty easy to remember what year you went back in time.
You could then take the gains and buy $200 Puts cause $TTD did fall to $180 afterwards. 
You'd probably get a call from the SEC and IRS though. But I'm sure Bitcoin millionaires got a call too.

You could certainly get higher. By just remembering how high it went. Personally, I would have chosen $SHOP or $TTD.
Basically, just remember the highest it went, and if you can, the year it did it. Every time it goes down, and the price of OTM calls drop even more, just keep buying calls expiring that specific year.
@_date: 2019-11-20 22:16:56
We are talking about $25k because all we did from 2010 to end of 2016 was save. $TTD didn't IPO until end of 2016 so you couldn't drop in $3.6k a year.

There's the whole "95% of traders lose money thing". Technically, we all lose money at some point. When I started trading, I lost 300. But instead of giving up, you should take the time to learn more. Yes it's disheartening to lose, but trading is a skill just like most things. You can improve. Lot of people give up after they lose their first big amount of money.

It's past Halloween. We missed it. Bitcoin can't even be festive. Bitcoin is dead.
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:10:56
Ive been holding BTC since 2012, trading stocks since 2014, and I started trading BTC last year. 
I hold stocks, and I trade stocks. I trade crypto, and I hold crypto. There's no reason to not trade it if you know what you're doing. In addition, I'm in my early 20s studying business and have a big interest in risk management. I have my whole life to make back anything I lose. 
Am I gambling? A bit. Is it a calculated risk? Yes. The %gains potential is worth the risk
@_date: 2017-11-02 14:16:38
Depends on which method you think will be more profitable.
1.  You hold BTC. Obviously you're making money right now cause people are pumping it for free coin. You can wait right before the fork and sell.
2.  You hold through the fork. And this is uncertain. Will the value of BTC go up or down? (My bet is down in the short term, up in the long)? Will there combined value of your BTC and B2X be a profit? Will it be a significant profit. Will you time your sells at the right time? 
3.  You sell your BTC and take your profits. Use them to buy alts, which are all pretty damn low right now. You don't have to worry about the safety of your BTC or splitting it (Shapeshift/Coinbase/etc playing games). Then after the fork, BTC and B2X money will flow back into alts as people take their BTC/B2X profits and run. 
I am doing a combination of 1 and 3.  I did make a good profit off of 1. I should have held a bit longer and sold at 7k instead of 6.2k, but that's fine. I still make a huge profit. I dropped it into LTC. It's very low right now, and should spike again like we saw with the BCH fork. Then I'll sell, and use profits to buy BTC again when it's low. 
I also see a lot of promise in LTC. It has made a better profit than BTC this year (with ATH and current price).  I see a better future for LTC especially from a usability standpoint.  LTC is also on most exchanges, so it is easily accessible.  While I see LTC as a better system, I'll still mostly be holding in BTC because that's where the money is. It's the big name.
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:39:01
That's because people are selling alts for BTC to get more coin before the fork.  After the fork, B2X money and some BTC money will flow back into alts. After the BCH fork, LTC went from 40 to 90. That's a 125% gain in a few weeks.  Personally, if I can get another 100% gain, I'll sell my LTC for cheaper BTC.  
I think the gain from LTC post-fork is more than I will get from having B2X coins.  
I bought BTC at 3000 in Sept, then more at 4700.  Sold it at 6200.  Loaded up on a ton of LTC at 50.  If it goes 100+, I'll sell to buy BTC during the BTC sell off.

I don't know why people think we "pro traders" don't make money. I got in the recent climb at 4600, sold at 7100, that's a 55% gain. Use that to get in Litecoin at 52, then sold at 67, for a 30% gain. I made a total of 85% from this whole deal. Whereas hodling from 4600 to 6500 (9am est) is only 40% gains.
I actually got in lower at 3k during the September China FUD, but I don't think that counts because it was a separate ordeal. 
I've been hodling since 2012, so I'm not some guy just here for the money, I've followed Bitcoin for years and I used to only hodl. That was back when I believe Bitcoin was the future. Now there are better options, but Bitcoin is the face of crypto, so it isn't going anywhere.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:40:01
I'm all for Bitcoin, but this mentality s just going to hurt Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-13 14:56:19
Bitcoin is Myspace. We are still in it's prime, and I'll ride wave, but better options are already out there catching up.
@_date: 2017-11-02 17:42:49
Sold half my 2012 holdings for textbooks in 2013. When I began trading in stocks and crypto, I lost a large percent in both. I used that as a learning opportunity for both. But now I'm up 57% for the year in stocks, and more in crypto. Up total over all. 
Buying and holding will always be more safe than trading. But trading will always have more profit potential.
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:29:19
Nope.  You can buy .0001 bitcoin, and you can spend it too.
@_date: 2018-02-08 13:52:29
Winners or losers on the 15/30 min and 4 hour time frame. 
In the end, I have no losers. I only trade winners. Only good solid coins. Its just some days one coin "wins more".
That's why it's so important to know both fundamental and technical analysis.
@_date: 2018-02-08 02:57:09
Not saying how much I have, but I an up 17x my original BTC position by trading alts. All I did was have a nice portfolio of not too many coins, but enough to hit each industry. Then I just kept investing my winners of the day into my losers of the day. Did that for 5 months.
@_date: 2017-10-21 14:55:00
I've been looking at Exodus. Will they support everything?
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:55:09
Mostly Bittrex. But Binance and Kucoin treated me well too. Cryptopia was okay. Mercatox made me want to kill myself, but at least I got in Raiblock (Nano) at $0.17.

Some people, even young, just don't get it. I'm in my early 20s myself, and all my friends are uninterested. I've been hodling since 2012 when I was still in highschool, but that's because of my interest in business/money/economics and risk management. I was in highschool learning about risk management in personal finance and economics class. At the same time, a few guys on Reddit gave me a bit of BTC to get me started. So my interests merged. Since I was young, I figured I could be a bit riskier since I have my whole life to rebuild what I could have lost.
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:13:11
I tell everyone around me, no one gives a shit. Eh, more coin for me.

I can't stop seeing the arm as a penis...

I watched it, I don't remember seeing an address. Unless I missed it.

Never know if you don't try :P

Keepkey looks really nice too. Differences with them?
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:37:57
Difference between Trezor and Ledger Nano S?
@_date: 2018-07-14 17:57:27
Sounds like a downside
@_date: 2015-04-06 04:10:26
But the cat with the penis arm takes Bitcoin! So I'm on board.
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:45:59
Thinking about a KeepKey. Pretty similar? Or am I missing something.
@_date: 2017-10-24 10:23:53
My KeepKey arrives on the 24th, just in time for the BTG fork. For clarification, are these the correct steps to getting both coins and converting to BTC?
1. Open KeepKey and create wallet
2. Transfer BTC from exchange to KeepKey
3. Wait til after fork
4. Get Coinami and use KeepKey phrase to load wallet
5. Reset KeepKey and create new wallet
6.  Send BTC to KeepKey 
7.  Sell BTG (where?) and use money to buy BTC?
 
7v2.  Use Shapeshift to convert BTG to BTC
8.  Send new BTC to KeepKey.
Edit: Same for B2X?
@_date: 2017-10-26 07:15:39
So my hardware wallet arrives tomorrow. I'm good for The B2X split, but unsure about the BTG split. I haven't touched my coin. How would I split it? Using Electrum
@_date: 2017-10-21 22:45:56
That is true. Even now, being in college and working, my income is quite low. That's why most my Bitcoin back in highschool came from making stupid jokes on Reddit that someone chuckled at and tipped me. That being said, I do put most of my money in Bitcoin, second most in -esque stock trading (+40% for the year bb), and a good portion into safe index funds.
The way I saw it back then (and now still) is "I don't mind losing the .05BTC I buy here and there, but who knows, I could end up being the headline about that guy that forgot he held BTC for 5 years."
@_date: 2015-02-04 00:38:48
Wait, so I'm new-ish.  How much *is* 5000 bits?  
Also, is there a minimum to tip? 
@_date: 2015-02-04 08:57:57
Holy crap!
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:56:19
Oh that's neat! Says I can create my own too.
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:13:45
How did you tip without a number?
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:32:32
Oh I'm late huh...
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:20:58
So I'm new. How do I use the bitcoin after I have it.
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:32:01
How much is 4000 bits? I've seen you throw huge numbers around.
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:53:34
Oh cool! Thats awesome, so I could tip big numbers like that without going broke.
@_date: 2015-02-04 19:35:11
Noon here, what is and how do you flash sell
@_date: 2015-02-04 21:41:52
