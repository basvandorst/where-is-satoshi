Because those are well developed companies that don't innovate like small companies. The don't want or need their own coin because they are successful and profitable. 
If they launch their own coin and it fails it is bad. If they do nothing it is good: they are still successful and profitable.

Too funny. He is saying that certain rules should apply for everyone, except the biggest and richest players.
He spent 95% of the article talking about why Bitcoin is not legitimate and not "run by grownups". The last part is an attempt to help the current powerful players get an advantage over others.
Lame. But a typical view from Wall Street.

I hope so. The more Bitcoins politicians have the less problems they will create.
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:11:28
Great point. However, it is easier and faster to create the paper wallet than installing the Bitcoin client.
And, I don't know if it is possible or practical to install the Bitcoin client without connecting to the internet.

I don't think this proves that he created Bitcoin, and he probably didn't even say this. The whole article is filled with comments that don't really prove anything.
@_date: 2014-03-12 16:53:18
Yes, but the quality of the posts is inversely proportional to the price of Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-01-17 02:15:33
Why is this the most popular post on r/Bitcoin?
Can someone explain what the significance of this is? I understand that Bitcoin is great because it can replace fiat currency and government money with technology.

Many people think that the dollar is going to collapse, and rising inflation will be the next step.
***And,*** if the dollar collapses or if the US has high inflation, Bitcoin could become the preferred store of value. This could push Bitcoin to over $100,000 per Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:47:28
It's the next step in the collapse of the dollar. And Bitcoin is a possible replacement.

@_date: 2013-11-25 10:48:09
It's hard to say. You have to look at the flow of money vs. the price.
If hedge funds come in, then who else would? Mutual funds? Governments? Those would increase Bitcoin by 100x - 1,000x.
@_date: 2013-12-01 21:06:20
I assume so. There should be no lag. The only reason there is lag on Mt. Gox is because they are so incompetent.
The lag has been going on for at least 9 months and they still haven't fixed it.
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:10:36
I think it can go up 10x within the next year.
It went from $10 to $950 in about a year, or $100x.
@_date: 2013-11-27 04:37:37

Why? The gold price is always changing. I don't see the psychological significance.
Are gold bugs suddenly going to sell gold and buy Bitcoin? They don't seem very tech savvy.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:40:50
Yes, that's a good analogy. 
Bitcoin is like email for money. Each account has an address on the internet. You send money into it. It's like a bank account but there is no central authority.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:17:05


What does this mean? Are you afraid of the government? You have nothing to fear as long as you are honest and pay your taxes.
If you want to keep a low pro, then transfer amounts less than $5,000 at a time. But I don't think this will make a difference because if you are depositing large amounts of money over weeks or months the government will probably find out.

Great questions. I am also figuring out Electrum, so here's a few answers:
2.You should only keep Electrum on a secure computer. For cold storage, take the wallet file off the computer and keep it on a USB drive.
4.The seed is a way of retrieving the wallet without the wallet.dat file. So, even if you lose the file, you can get it back with just the seed.
5.I would keep an encrypted copy of the wallet in 2 online storage places, such as Gmail and Dropbox. Use a strong password that cannot be cracked. Memorize the seed.

But the good news is that when they fail we get to bail them out.
Sheesh. What a terrible deal.
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:43:04
Yes, it's a double top. But that doesn't mean that bitcoin is going to go down. How many double tops don't go down?
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:13:04
So, what you are really saying is that hedge funds won't push the price up.
I'm not so sure about this. They could start a pump and then lock in profit by selling part of their position.
Also, Bitcoin is going up faster than other assets, so they may feel the need to get in even if they start moving the market.
And, the interesting point that you have made is that they are likely to buy when the market is down. This would have the effect of reducing the duration of slumps.
@_date: 2013-12-26 18:24:58
It's not a hassle. Honest, law abiding people who have nothing to hide are happy to give their bank info to Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:28:35
Really? I installed BitcoinQT and downloaded it in a day. That was about 1 or 2 weeks ago.
@_date: 2013-11-24 20:40:25
I hope so. This alone will drive the price up by 100x. They own $1.1 trillion of bad US debt.
Just buying 1% of that would be $11 billion, which is more than the current total value of all bitcoins ($8 billion). If they spent $11 billion on bitcoin it would go up by over 10x.
Just announcing that they are buying would make it double.
@_date: 2013-12-20 21:31:55
This is a very interesting point.
So, you seem to be saying that if inflation gets high, the Fed would stop buying debt. So, does that mean that the government would not be able to borrow more money?
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:16:43
I'm not sure if this helps:
November 20, People's Bank of China Deputy Governor Yi Gang's first talk in a forum bitcoin. Yi Gang said that from the perspective of the People's Bank, near impossible to recognize the legitimacy of Bitcoin. But he also believes that bitcoin transaction as a sale and purchase behavior on the Internet, ordinary people have the freedom to participate. In addition, Yi Gang also noted bitcoin "very characteristic", with "inspiring", individuals will remain long-term concern.

@_date: 2013-11-23 14:38:35
Yep, that's just the thing that would set off panic buying. Bitcoin would probably go up by 10x in 6 months.
@_date: 2013-12-21 15:48:42

You probably have to download something. Or perhaps an ActiveX thing or browswer tool or Java applet.
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:58:34
Nice. It is growing by 10x per year.
With a little luck, we'll be at 10,000 by then end of 2014.
For all the haters, consider this: Only a few million $ worth of hedge fund money has come in. When billions of $ of hedge fund money comes in, it easily push up the price by 10x.

Compared to the $50 trillion of dollars and $50 trillion of stocks, Bitcoin is nothing. $20 trillion total in bitcoin is about $1 million/bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:56:42
It's a great idea. Start trading small and slowly build up. Learn how to trade from books and stuff.
Also, Bitcoin is an all-or-nothing play. If it succeeds it will be worth $100k+ per bitcoin. If it fails, it will be 0. So buying now and waiting is a good strategy.
@_date: 2013-11-24 23:27:17

The FTC has done nothing to Butterfly Labs. So much for consumer protection.
You have 2 choices:
1. Contact a lawyer and form a class action lawsuit. Find thousands of angry customers and get them to join. This should be very easy. This will cause them problems but won't really help you, because you will probably just get your money back.
2. Sell your miner on Craigslist and move on.
I lost 25 BTC (thanks, BFL), and opted for the 2nd option. Life it too short to waste time being angry. Just find another way to get rich.
Besides, Bitcoin is hot now so you should be able to sell it for $1,000 - $2,000.
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:22:32
This is awesome. Here comes the money. 
Dozens of hedge fund companies are going to see this and start their own Bitcoin fund. 
Bitcoin will go up by 10x - 100x next year because of the $1 billion that flows in from hedge funds alone.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:46:00
This isn't possible. It would be easy to hide functionality that would steal all the bitcoins.

What's the problem? You agreed to the price. It is set.
It takes a few days to transfer the money from your account because of the antiquated banking system.
After 30 days you can set up a credit card (that is used as a backup finding source) and you can get instant delivery.
After using Mt Gox for a while, I can tell you that Coinbase is 100 times better.

It's about first mover advantage. If you are reading this you are a first mover. 99.99% of the people don't have any bitcoins. And they won't have any tomorrow. You can.
I think your best bet is to find leveraged investments. Right now icbit.se is good. When a new stock market is created (like BitFunder or BTCT.co) there will be stock bubbles and hype cycles. 
Any good Bitcoin investment will return 10x within 6 months. You can start small and grow.

Revealing your personal info is safe enough. Using Mt. Gox is dangerous.
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:22:00
Actually, it's pretty easy to guess based on the previous 3 bubbles.
I don't know about the first bubble, but the second was $3 -&gt; $30, which is 10x. The last was $10 -&gt; $260, which is 26x. This one started around $150. So, 10x is $1,500, 20x is $3,000.
It's just a guess, but the current price of $830 seems too low to be the top of a bubble. And, when bubbles burst they do not return to their previous high after a few days.
So, I think we are 1/3 to 1/2 of the way into a bubble.
FWIW, if the price stabilizes it will no longer a bubble, and start a new period.

First thing is to back up the wallet.dat file. Make sure it is secure.
Then you can do other things like encrypting it with a STRONG password (around 16 characters, uppercase, lowercase and symbols). If you do this, then I would write down or print the password on a few sheets of paper and distribute them geographically. A bank safety deposit box is perfect.
Then, you can store a copy of the encrypted file in your Gmail, GDrive and Dropbox.
If you have 3 or 4 copies of the key and 3 or 4 copies of the encrypted wallet file, AND THEY ARE STORED SEPARATELY, then you should be able to access it in the future and it would be difficult for them to be stolen.
Also, you may want to transfer some amount (10%?) to a separate wallet that you can access periodically. I think you MUST BACK UP THE WALLET FILE AFTER you make this transfer. When you transfer coins from one address to another they all go to a new address, so the old address is empty.
@_date: 2013-12-01 04:45:14
Why would you trust a large amount of bitcoin to any site?
How do you know that the addresses are not pre-generated and you are sending the bitcoins to someone else?

@_date: 2013-12-09 17:32:42
Yes. I hope it will exceed the value of ***any single*** financial institution.
Why are you comparing it to an institution anyway?
I would compare it to fiat currency which is about $30 trillion, gold which is about $8 trillion, Real Estate which is about $40 trillion, and stocks and mutual funds which is about $75 trillion.
Plus derivatives, which is over $100 trillion.

@_date: 2013-11-23 13:54:26
I agree. How many people have bitcoins? 7,000,000?
There are 7 billion people, so only 0.1% of people have bitcoins. This is the very beginning.
If 100x people use it when "it plateaus", then the value should rise at least 1,000x.
That makes $1,000,000/bitcoin.

This is true. But there is also a significant chance that Bitcoin will be replaced with something "better". It seems unlikely to me that something as revolutionary as Bitcoin would remain the standard after 5 or 10 years.

This is an interesting point. If transactions grow faster than storage space decreases, it will get more expensive.
Price for storage drops by about 1/2 each year. But number of transactions might grow by 100x or 1,000x per year.
It won't affect most people because you don't need the blockchain to do a transaction. And, there could be an update  to the code so you only need the last x transactions to mine, instead of the entire blockchain.

How can you find the elasticity from the volume? Volume is people buying and selling.
For example, if I sell 100 BTC in a week, and someone else buy 100 BTC in the same week, the volume is 100 BTC. But if the price has not changed during the week, then no money has flowed in.
Now, a buyer comes in and pushes the price up with very little money if few people are willing to sell.
So, it seems to me that volume is much higher than the amount required to move the market.
Here's another way of expressing my idea: You say 10 days volume is $1 billion. But that is for all the people buying and selling already. It doesn't tell us anything about what happens if more money comes in.
@_date: 2013-11-25 04:19:04

Institutional money? There is $2 trillion in hedge funds in the US alone (apparently -  10% of 2 trillion is $200 billion. Bitcoin total is only $9 billion!
When that money comes in Bitcoin will go up by 100x.
There is $60 trillion in stocks in the world. If 10% of that money comes in bitcoin will go up by another 10x - 100x.
So that makes an increase of 1,000x to 10,000x.
That puts us at a minimum of $1,000,000 per bitcoin.
Awesome. Thank you for the info.

No, you should not leave them on Coinbase for long periods of time.
Short periods is OK.
@_date: 2013-11-29 03:47:26
If only I could use it to create Bitcoins...
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:41:44
I wouldn't bother trying to convince them.
@_date: 2013-11-29 15:32:59
I think it's the antiquated banking system and Coinbase managing its risk.
Take it as a lesson. It takes months to properly get set up with Bitcoin. You will be ready for the next big Bitcoin sale.
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:02:12
Yes. It's 20%.
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:06:58
No. They will deliver it in in 12 months+, if at all.
You will mine a total of .001 BTC.
I lost 25 BTC from my hardware from BFL. They will screw you.
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:18:09
Yep. If you know yourself it is easy to succeed.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:32:00
I think so.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:37:26
Yes, I think so. And I hope so!
I imagine that the scenario goes like this: a powerful government (not the US, but perhaps China) figures out that the dollar is in trouble. They have too much US debt and know that if they start selling it could cause the US to default.
So they stop buying US debt and start buying bitcoins. They know that if word leaks out it will cause the price to take off, so they keep it secret for as long as possible.
The price of Bitcoin slowly and consistently rises for a few months. It might go up 3x. People have all sorts of theories about why the pattern of bubble and bust has changed to a slow and consistent rise.
Word gets out and other countries decide to dump the dollar and buy Bitcoin. Bitcoin goes up 10x in the next few months.

Antiquated money system wishes Bitcoin were under pressure but actually the existing system is going to be destroyed.
Just like book stores and newspapers and postal mail.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:36:09
There is something called vision.
I agree with some of your argument:
no one gets paid in bitcoins. so even if major retailers accept bitcoin only .00001% of the population will have any to spend with
not even anonymous. the feds are all over bitcoin now
cumbersome, hard to use for non-tech people, 14 minute delay between transactions
no consumer protection. perfect for scammers
most of the usage here  is from satoshi dice, wallet transfers, etc and relativity few actual productive commerce
environmental waste from the inordinate power required to mine bitcoins
However, that is the situation today. What about in a year? What about in 5 years?
This is not a problem for law abiding citizens, which most people are: not even anonymous. the feds are all over bitcoin now
All of the real problems that you have described are easily solved:
cumbersome, hard to use for non-tech people, 14 minute delay between transactions
no consumer protection. perfect for scammers

There is no such thing as intrinsic value. That is an old paradigm that is outdated and stupid.
The dollar has no intrinsic value. It's just paper.
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:15:49
This makes no sense to me.
It is easy to convert cash into Bitcoins. It only takes 20 seconds. Just set up an account on Coinbase or another exchange and answer some questions. Then, when you buy something in Bitcoin buy a little more Bitcoin than you spent.
Maybe I just don't get it.
@_date: 2013-12-09 13:37:29
Woof woof woof woof.
@_date: 2013-11-25 11:16:48
According to  it only takes $24 million to push the price to $1,600.
Why couldn't $1 billion push it to $8,000?
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:23:36


What does this have to do with the price of Bitcoin in China? You don't need a bank account to buy bitcoin. You only need money. Find a way. Get cash. Use a friend's account.
Leave your parents out of it. You are probably much smarter and know much more. At least you read this Bitcoin reddit, which is a great source of information.
Don't try to convince them of anything. When you are rich you can tell them what they should do.
@_date: 2013-11-25 10:14:34
Yeah, I feel the same way. I got my Macbook Air a year and a half ago, before I started buying at $11.
Now I want to get a new one and it is only about 1.2 bitcoins. Wow.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:04:05
Awesome. Thank you.
@_date: 2013-11-25 18:15:54
Why can't a mutual fund buy an ETF? There will soon be 2 Bitcoin ETF's.
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:40:25
and characters...
I would invest 50% now, and the rest if it drops.
Only invest what you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:24:21
I hope it goes to 1 cent. Then I will buy 1,000,000.
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:44:57
Actually that is a really good point. People should spend the first day reading and learning before doing anything.
Conveniently it takes 24 hours to download the blockchain.
@_date: 2013-12-20 17:22:02
Me too. I remember the April bubble being similar to this last bubble.
My prediction (AKA hope) is that there is another bubble next year that goes to $5,000 per bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:38:00
It's only 1,000 BTC. I'll give it 2 hours.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:37:26
@_date: 2013-12-05 04:20:05
Yes, but stocks, real estate and derivatives are over 100 trillion dollars.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:29:14
Oh, I see. You are daytrading.
I'm not really sure if Coinbase is bad because you lock in the price.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:47:10
Actually, it's easier to move on and redo your intricate financial system. It only seems hard because there is no immediate need to do so. Until they do something really annoying.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:34:45
@_date: 2013-12-01 20:52:36
I don't think it is market manipulation because:
1. Wall street is not working today. It's Sunday.
2. The market has been weakening for a few days.
3. The market is always weak over the weekend.
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:19:38
I think bitcoinboobs is better.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:58:14
Don't blame Bitcoin. The government destroyed the dollar.
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:25:50
What downvote?

I'm trying to set up Electrum as well. It's definitely a challenge.
Here's what I suggest:
1. Figure out how to install it from the internet. See below.
2. Download and verify all the files using GPG or Ubuntu package manager.
3. Boot from LiveCD (or USB) and then figure out how to install the files that you have downloaded.
How to install from Internet. Here's what worked for me on Ubuntu 12.04:
1. Download Electrum-1.9.5.tar.gz from 
2. Verify the file using GPG
3. sudo apt-get install python-qt4 python-pip
4. sudo pip install Electrum-1.9.5.tar.gz
I guess you need to download python-qt4 and python-pip for offline install, but I don't know how to do that yet.
