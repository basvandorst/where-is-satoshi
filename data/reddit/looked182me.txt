I'm not accusing him, publicly admitted the ~6 million doge he tipped one night on IRC was a viral marketing campaign sourced from investors' funds.  It's difficult finding his exact post in where he admitted as such, but at least in the IRC tipping case, that was practically recycling investors' funds in an effort to buy some cheap good will and more moolah-worshippers (in a subreddit ripe for the picking, Edit: I remember moolah_'s admission was in response to concern from an investor who was wondering where the ATMs were (good question, even today)

False.  I remember when Alex Green (tipped several million dogecoin on  including 2 million to a user who rehashed the tired "she wants the D" joke.
When asked the next day where the ~6M dogecoin came from, said it came from **investors' funds** (those dumb enough to buy a piece of the pie) and the late night IRC tipping spree was "viral marketing."  He wasn't tipping his own doge; he was tipping the community back a small fraction of its own doge.

Here's proof Alex Green used investor funds to tip back to the community to reap good will (all the while not producing what he promised, e.g. ATMs):
