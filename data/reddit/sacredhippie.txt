If anyone wants to look into the wallet it is "Mobi- Global Bitcoin Wallet" on the Appstore.

I'm 16- been working since 14. 
Part time job, $10 an hour 15-20/25 hours a week. That avg of about $185 a week (just because vacations and holidays, ~2 months a year) 
so that's 52weeks in a year, subtract 8 weeks- that's 44. 
44x185=$8,140 dollars each year I work this job at this pay rate. 
Now- for example, mainly go to be full time at age 18. I've earned ~32,000 dollars since age 14. Or, to be more realistic and general. Earnings are roughly $16,280 since age 16. 
Now US Census reports here: [Median Income Of Full-Time Male Workers]( is $51.6k a year in the USA. 
So; 35 years x $51,600= $1,806,000
So in theory, the average American Male would earn that $1.8M sum by the age of 53 years old, or possibly 52 if you count the earnings they acquired before 18.

Figured it was worth a shot to solve my anxious tendencies

Gotta say- besides the growing demand from asia, this is also a good hypothesis.

Yes, I did- wasn't sure about security although it shows it's secure id rather not risk it. If you need it again I can post it. I got 1/3 confirmation now though so I'm not too worried. I appreciate your help���� first confirmation took 72 minutes I think

I know right, we're crazy

Can you define TX fee?
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:51:22
Is TX fee same as the Transaction fee?
