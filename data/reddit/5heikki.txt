It's not going to happen because larger blocks go directly against Blockstream's goals.

Heh, I wonder if this is the reason why unconfirmed transactions topped 250k and the pool included transactions with over $1,000 fees..

That's quite interesting, but would a neutral party e.g. use the BCash term? Also, which devs sit at big meetings that e.g. Coinbase CEO blogs about? The repo doesn't tell the whole story..

Exactly. I wouldn't be surprised if at some point Blockstream devs reduced block size.

Or more specifically AXA/Blockstream is the owner as all the Core devs that matter get their pay-check from them. Really have to salute AXA for basically buying the ownership of Bitcoin for mere $55M.

You can't argue that BCH isn't closer to Satoshi's white paper than BTC is, so in that sense BCH is very much the real Bitcoin. If you take a close look, the white paper doesn't endorse side chains or turning a privately owned company into the central bank of Bitcoin. There's a reason why also Gavin said that BCH is the real Bitcoin. It might be that in the end AXA/Blockstream Coin will be technically superior to BCH, but it will still not make it the real Bitcoin®

Hi guys, I've been into Bitcoin for like two months and I totally speak for the entire community when I express my opinions

How about Gavin Andresen? He was chosen by Satoshi him/herself to be the leader of Bitcoin so surely he's the best to comment, no?

More like 10k by October 2017.
