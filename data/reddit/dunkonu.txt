He should wait. Now panic is setting in and shaking out more weak hands. When Bitcoin falls below 7-8k, he should buy.

Nobody knows for sure. I think it will go down to about 7k where the last explosion started and go up from there again.

Again? Dude, get your act together!

It will go back up. It's still only the beginning.

People only see what they want to see. Doesn't matter how smart they are (or think they are).

I still think Bitcoin will correct back to 6-7k before it significantly goes up again and the second time around it will break 25-30k.

That was about the market value when the last explosion upwards started. It usually dips back a little further. I'm probably wrong. Maybe it stops earlier - or later. If I knew exactly, I'd be rich and not posting on Reddit...

I always thought a crash would be quicker. Feels like an eternity already. 
...but let's be serious for a minute: The whole market is worth $429.296.579.881 right now. I'd say the real value is somewhere about $350.000.000.000 - so it should stop somewhere around there and start going in the other direction after a phase of stablization. So we should drop another 15-20%. I'd buy there - a lot - and even if it still goes downhill, I know I tried. ;)

I like this idea. Unfortunately, everyone paid a different entry fee to this community and some paid more than they could actually afford.
