I do run a full bitcoin node, Bitcoin-Xt in fact. I use bitcoin from crafting raw P2SH transactions to sending IOUs off chain on Coinbase. I apologise but I fail to see any substance in your first paragraph.
The white paper sets out the intent. We all know the block size is a tradeoff, balancing transaction processing capacities and node &amp; miner bandwidth and storage requirements. However, network bandwidth **is** getting faster and cheaper. So is storage space. It is lucidious to propose that we should keep a 1 MB blockchain size forever, when everyone will have gigabit fibre and exabyte flash drives.
1 MB in 2009, adjusted for Nielsen's law and Moore's law, turns out to be 8 MB by 2016 (the earliest date when the fork may take effect). Conversely, if you think 8 MB in 2016 will cause "devastating" centralisation pressures, then why does bitcoin have a 3 billion dollar market cap when the same pressures have been applied for all of Bitcoin's history?
Your point on mining pools is a good one. However, reducing the block size (because inaction IS reducing the block size, the same way inflation means inaction IS throwing away purchasing power) will not make miners solo mine. As someone who have mined throughout 2011 to 2013, I used pools to reduce variance - not because I cannot afford a $5/month VPS that is entirely sufficient for mining relay.
More than 50% of the hashpower have started putting 8M into their block headers. The vast majority of merchants support bigger blocks. The proposal we're talking about will only come into effect once 75% of miners concretely agree.
You're saying that everyone doesn't agree with 8Mb being entirely handleable. If so, why do miners think they can handle it? Are they throwing away their business for nothing to see bitcoin "fail"? Or can we actually handle 8MB blocks? Clearly we have a differing theories. But inaction favours your side, so of course you champion inaction and suggest that 75% miner agreement, widespread merchant and user agreement isn't enough to **NOT REDUCE** the block chain size (in inflation adjusted terms).
Trustlessness is criticial to Bitcoin, we both agree. But so is ensuring that we have the ability to actually use Bitcoin. We can let every smartphone be a node, have a hundred million nodes with 1 transaction per year. That will be very trustless, but that's not a working system. Alternatively, we can let bitcoin handle more users. So more people will run full nodes, even if the percentage drops. There are multiple theories. We have a disagreement as to which direction we should go. A hard fork is inevitable for as long as there are people proposing to reduce the block size, after adjusting for inflation.
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:24:11
Contradictory to your assertions, theymos's definition of an "altcoin" **does not have consensus** -- just like how XT does not have consensus. Multiple Bitcoin core developers do not agree with his definition of altcoin, and consider XT to be bitcoin.
It's fair to argue that XT is an altcoin. There's merit to that, but also merit against it. However, it is still an **opinion** and not a fact or a common view; by definition it is not "justifiable" as a reason to ban discussion of XT.
You will also note that theymos conceded on this point (ie: "XT is an altcoin") by changing the sidebar rules to directly ban XT outright.
Finally, theymos has indeed manipulated the discourse on larger blocks by aggregating (and hence minimizing) the discussion on bitcoin availability. This isn't even up for dispute.

You're definitely correct that XT/101 supporters have employed 'populist' tactics. Firstly, I disagree that the blatant censorship and opinion manipulation employed by small block supporters, especially and the Bitcoin.org maintainers, are any better.
If you're wondering what I'm referring to, just look at the minimization ("Scaling Bitcoin") and outright censorship of civil discussion, or the vote score hiding (fine by itself) combined with default sorting by "controversial" on specific -- and only specific -- threads where small block views are promoted.
Secondly, 'populism' relies and propagates on the free will and thoughts of the community (albeit perhaps excessively). Manipulation, on the other hand, relies on using social power structures to artificially promote a point of view. I'll leave it up to you to decide which is better.

While that may work in perfectly symmetrical networks, in the current Bitcoin world we have the GFW and Chinese miners having more than 50% of hashpower. Thus, it doesn't matter if you mine short blocks while outside the GFW, because (i)  it still propagates slower to inside the GFW and (ii) the GFW has a majority of the hashpower.

minimum practical transaction size and cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions,
and   there   is   a   broader   cost   in   the   loss   of   ability   to   make   non-reversible   payments   for   non-

If my cup of coffee cannot go on the blockchain, secured by petahashes of hashpower and I am forced to use a non-Bitcoin network that interfaces with Bitcoin, then I am no longer using bitcoin (even if I'm actually transacting bitcoin-representative tokens!) In the financial world, we call these IOUs. The same IOUs that your banks and the Federal Reserve issue.
Fundamentally, some people in the bitcoin community want to change bitcoin from being a decentralised ledger supporting a payments system, to a decentralised ledger supporting a third party ecosystem. These people in the bitcoin community are often employed by commercial, for-profit companies who will profit from adoption of the third party networks that *they* create.
Fundamentally, my definition of bitcoin is different to your definition of "bitcoin". If you don't agree that I should have the right to make transactions, big or small, as long as it can be handled by the network (and 8 MB is entirely handleable), then you are not talking about the bitcoin I signed up for.

I agree with all the technical points you made, and weakly agree with your other points but I have different interpretations. But that doesn't matter :)
My concern with the scaling roadmap is that soft-fork SegWit is inferior to hard-fork SegWit and increases the complexity of wallets and nodes. It's clear that SegWit has complete consensus and we should minimize technical debt and do a SegWit hard fork, which is low risk with good co-ordination. I think the benefit/costs are worth it.
Unfortunately, it does seem that doing it with a soft fork is a partly political decision to distinguish it from XT / hard forks, and not a purely technical decision.
Contradictory to some people's claims, bitcoin has already hard forked. A 0.3.2 node will not sync and I believe has a slightly different conflicting blocks at its tail (some miners have tried to mine with it much later on). But that's OK, because *everyone* upgraded.
There is also broader consensus that even with Lightning and SegWit, we need to increase the block size later on and it is safe to do so. This is obvious, given that network bandwidth and speeds do increase over time. This will require a hard fork. Bitcoin **will** need to hard fork and increase the block size at some point (assuming bitcoin doesn't die); even Rusty agrees. Lightning can do a lot, but it still requires sufficiently cheap on-chain settlement for security, and sufficiently cheap on-chain settlement requires sufficient capacity.
If we can agree on 2/4/8 (rescaled for SegWit conservatively, so 1.25MB / 2.5 MB / 5 MB nominal block size) as suggested on the mailing list roadmap and do that with the SegWit hard fork, then I see that as the most optimal plausible path.
I doubt that'll happen tho. Design by committee with veto will probably result in 1MB + SegWit for many many years despite larger blocks being safer and create uncertainty which will certainly negatively impact on bitcoin (less users, devs, companies, and investors interested).
@_date: 2015-12-28 12:22:13
I'm actually not sure if this will happen. Miners can collude on settings, but the economic nodes like exchanges and payment processors may have lower limits with a sufficiently high outrun parameter. This will increase the risk of their block being rejected when they actually try to spend it, and all risks are costs. A 10% risk is sufficient enough to devastate the profit margins of miners and hence miners naturally won't set excessive limits. 
The main, completely blocking issue with BU is that it devalues 1,2,..6,even 10 or 20 confirmations, because depending on your parameters you could be on the wrong chain for a while, and the latest chain doesn't mean the long chain. It reworks fundamental assumptions about proof of work and ends up with nothing. 
A better design would be perhaps bitcoin stakeholders (ie: coin age) voting on block size, with the actual limit being a slowly moving regression to the "lowest 50% majority denominator" limit. It may be possible to condense this voting data into a few kilobytes as we do not care about individual votes, only a cryptographically verifiable output. 
The votes could be weekly, biweekly, or monthly. A slow regression of the actual limit prevents surprises, and we can assume that buying up 50% of the Bitcoin is infeasible (and will result in Bitcoin holders making bazillion dollars). I think bitcoin holders are very much incentivised to choose the block size limit that will give the most value to Bitcoin, with respect to capacity and decentralization. 
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:07:46
There is no consensus on SegWit as a hard fork. Implementing SegWit as a soft fork adds complexity to the protocol, requires rewriting substantial parts of clients, miners, blockchain explorers, APIs, etc, and also causes old clients to accept ALL SegWit transactions as valid. A miner could spend Satoshi's coins AND an old client will accept it. 
On the other hand, switching to SegWit as hard fork involves getting everyone to upgrade. Which we HAVE already done, see the LevelDB migration. Older clients no longer sync with the Blockchain but it's fine.

Technically you may be right, but the practical effect is the same. Less nodes / miners are easier to identify and shut down or DDoS, Sybil attacks are easier, and the value of bitcoin (both monetary and utility) goes down just like with more centralization.

No, a lower fee transaction is still a standard transaction. It is just not accepted into the mempool, unless it has a high enough priority.
Non-standard transactions are rejected by **other** miners (they will refuse to build on top of a chain with those transactions). This does not happen in this case.
@_date: 2015-12-28 08:00:12
Smaller blocks does mean less capacity, which naturally leads to less users. It's possible to increase capacity through optimizations and alternate networks like Lightning, but nevertheless there is and will always be a linear relationship between block size and capacity.

The bandwidth requirements proposed by Gavin grows slower than Neilsen's law. Bitcoin is about tradeoffs, and more on-chain processing means less % users run full nodes. But that will result in more full nodes if there are now more users.

Not over short time periods, because there is no universal way to ge the current time. For example, it's up to the miner to say at what time they mined a block. Clients accept it if it's within 90 minutes.
Alt-chains that re-target sooner do not work the way you think it does -- they focus on preventing fluctuations while sacrificing accuracy. For a "timechain", you don't want 5 minutes to be 5 +- 90 minutes.

Exactly. Sometimes when there is a sustained minority, we still must push ahead because **inaction is an action**. By not increasing the blockchain size, we are choosing a future where Bitcoin is inaccessible to average people due to an artificial scarcity of the blockchain size.

Good plan, but I think SegWit should be done as a hard fork. Why?
1) It is an uncontroversial change. There won't be any noticeable resistance.
2) Hence, it is good for the developers, businesses, and the community to test the rollout of a hard fork.
3) Making SegWit a hard fork will make the protocol more intuitive and easier to understand / maintain. The costs of a hard fork are relatively low and has other benefits, but we should be thinking about the future and **minimizing technical debt**. 
Just imagine if a popular client 3 years later forked because they didn't handle soft-fork SegWit edge cases correctly.
@_date: 2015-12-26 11:40:34
You make some very good points. However, I'll say that being smart or the majority doesn't mean you're right. Take a look at the cryptography mailing list when Satoshi announced Bitcoin. The vast majority said it wasn't going to work, even called it a joke. A couple of people -  like Hal Finney for example - believed in it, against the vast majority of talented and well respected cryptographers. Now who's laughing. 
@_date: 2015-12-28 12:56:33
Since you commented here, I have a question for you: Is block pruning and non-genesis-blocks something that has equivalent or very similar security characteristics to full nodes?
Let's say every year or month, the core developers, industry (exchanges, wallets, etc), and community members all sign a message saying "Block 200,000 has the hash of &lt;x&gt;, and the UXTO at that time has a hash of &lt;y&gt;". 
People who believe that can choose to start their node at downloading from 200,000, and then prune blocks except the last few hundred and keep UXTO. What's are the security considerations of this?

But if we get bigger blocks, we will have to evaluate third party networks like Lightning on their own merits, instead of being forced to use it due to an artificial scarcity!
How will Blockstream deliver profits for its investors if if it turns out Bitcoin CAN handle 8 MB blocks?!?
@_date: 2015-12-28 07:55:31
No, it does matter what the cap is. However, larger caps do not mean larger blocks. For example, in 2010 bitcoin blocks were tens of kilobytes despite a 1 MB cap.
A common misconception is that blocksize cap == size of blocks. That's not true and is what's being refuted in the first part.
@_date: 2015-12-27 02:24:52
Not at all. This is an slippery slope argument. You might as well as argue "Today its Lightning, tomorrow it will be PayPal.".
One is an "anti-spam limit", one is an economic fundamental. The block size was never limited when Bitcoin was created. It probably should be, but 1mb is not a limit it should be set at forever. 
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:02:02
Oh no, Snowden told us a lot of new things.
@_date: 2015-12-28 14:17:37
Question: Why something like 2MB (12.5% increase from 1.75 MB) instead of, say, 3MB (71% increase from 1.75 MB)? There is less headroom, but I don't think it's a reasonable assumption that there will only be 12.5% more 'advanced' transactions. Multisig wallets (like Copay) should be the way to go.
Finally, has this (witness+tx limit) been discussed on the bitcoin-dev mailing list?
@_date: 2015-06-21 00:52:10
The counterargument is that a huge centralization of nodes does not matter, as you only need one honest node. It is okay if Bitcoin is run with just 100 nodes, with a system where new nodes are untrusted for a period of X days and gradually build more "reputation" based on them relaying info. Initially the client will warn you if it is not connected to at least 4 trusted nodes, preventing Sybil attacks without a long term investment.
It is okay if only servers in data centers can run full nodes. Satoshi designed bitcoin this way - for almost everyone to use spv.
@_date: 2015-12-17 17:09:33
"XT/101 trolls" is a very biased way to poison the well. Not everyone agrees on if it's the small blockers being 'trolls', censoring the debate through inherited and unelected power structures while using appeals to authorities without substance or backing.
I absolutely agree that Gregory Maxwell is an incredibly talented and skilled developer, but nevertheless it's important to keep in mind different people have different philosphical and political views of what bitcoin should be. There are technical tradeoffs with the proposals, but how important a particular tradeoff is **is** a political and not technical question.
@_date: 2015-06-10 01:57:38
This is not enforced by the protocol, nothing of this sort is iin it.
@_date: 2015-12-23 09:58:57
I haven't seen a good mechanism for preventing the development of clearing houses however. I think economies of scale will result in well-connected, established nodes becoming de-facto hubs -- especially if point of sale vendors like BitPay or Coinbase start running their own hubs that their services connect to by default.
I don't think the lightning network proposals have addressed this concern. These hubs could also be subsidized by their respective vendors and charge no fees, while ordinary node owners may want to charge fees to offset the time-value of bitcoin and node operating costs.

@_date: 2018-08-24 15:08:59
They did this during the bull run because literally more than 70% of transactions were sent from exchanges (expired after 15 minutes), or had low fees. 
Don’t blame them because the majority of bitcoin users use exchanges as a wallet and so most of their transactions were failing. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 08:45:05
One issue that people often miss about the proposed Lightning network is that it is only trustless if you also run a full node. With this consideration, its benefits become less significant as it turns out it's not a magical pill -- for trustlessness clients need a full node anyway, and once you have a full node why not just submit it onto the main blockchain? Sure, there's the blockchain size, but it is only a constraint if we artificially limit it below what the vast majority of miners and nodes can handle.
@_date: 2018-08-09 08:57:28
Now that is realistic. I have been a HODLer since 2015 as well, so while not as long as you, I've been through similar cycles.

A cryptocurrency that is centrally issued is a scam to me. Bitcoin was designed to ESCAPE from central authority.


That is correct. It would perhaps be better if the block distribution was reverse - 1 satoshi in the beginning, increasing to 50 BTC at the end.
Bitcoin isn't perfect, and Ripple isn't. But there isn't a central authority to benefit from it, and the premine was engineered by the creators to make them in an unfair way.

No. You can have IOUs **and** be full reserve like Coinkite. Just because you segregate funds and allocate each user their own private keys, doesn't mean that their balance is not an IOU - you're the one actually owning the private keys, so any balance on Coinkite is an IOU for the (segregated) funds..
TL;DR: You're still a bank, not a wallet. A wallet is something where the user exclusively controls their private keys - for example, Bitcoin Core, Electrum, Multibit, Blockchain.info, Bitaddress.org + notepad are wallets.

No no no no, it's not about running a full node. It is about block orphan rates.
Larger blocks = increased propagation latency = higher orphan rates.
The pool that mines the block does suffer from the higher orphan rates, as it doesn't need to verify / process / transmit it's own blocks before working on it (it already does so).
Currently, pools like BTC Guild and GHash have a &lt;1% boost in the efficiency due to lack of local orphaning. If the block size is increased, this can easily get into a more significant amount, forcing miners to use large pools or lose out on revenue.

Sure. Why don't I have **full and exclusive** control over my private keys?
You are NOT a wallet. You are a bank without insurance. I don't care how good your security is, or if you offer assurance that you are 'full reserve' -- if you do not have exclusive control over your private keys, you are not a wallet.
Some services use Multisig with nLocktime so that both of us must co-operate in order for funds to be sent. If both of us do not co-operate (eg: the site demands a 50% ransom or they won't sign the transaction), the nLockTime ensures that the Bitcoin network will automatically transfer coins to one of my addresses. This can be considered a wallet.
Any service where I do not generate the private keys, that are absolutely required (but may not be what's solely required) to spend the money, is not a wallet. **It's not how Satoshi designed Bitcoin** - a decentralized network for transactions **without** financial intermediaries.

This depends on how NYDFS interprets it. If you use 2FA on blockchain.info, you can argue that Blockchain.info does in fact control your funds, as their servers control if you can access your wallet.
The NYDFS should clarify these statements on if it applies to wallets where private keys belong to the user, but the server may enforce access mechanisms. 
This definitely applies to Greenaddress.it and other multisig implementations.

That's because the other cryptocurrencies are incredibly fragile. You are forgetting something: everything can be manipulated, the miner is in ultimate control.
The miner can choose **any** fee policy and relay **any** valid transaction. So it can simply send the same coins 100,000 times in a block, in 100k different transactions and you will have a few billion coins moved for your "algorithm".

Because it was never known that their AML/KYC extended to Bitcoin transactions? Tell me ONE other exchange that locks up your Bitcoin. Coinbase is the only one that implements this, and that's why I consider it theft.. 
Furthermore, Coinbase refuses to send it back to the originating address,  a staple of many other AML policies. Let me explain theft to you:


I deposited BTC under the assumption that I can withdraw it without any hoops to jump through.  This was also their policy at that time. Now,  their policies have changed retroactively and now they require verification for certain withdrawals, or at least my withdrawal.  That's theft because they never obtained my consent to enforce these btc AML provisions,  and a "We may take any action as necessary" does not count as informed consent.

Don't look at how many votes something have and assume it's good - it's being abused everyday.
One of the blatant examples regarding coinkite vote botting is that they've had a thread deleted by the mods (after they got caught), but anti-Coinkite comments in that thread kept getting downvotesdespite the thread *no longer being visible*.

Wait! Wallet as a service does have a unique value proposition. But this isn't 'wallet as a service'.
Actual 'wallet as a service' is called Multisig, meaning a Bitcoin address can be owned by multiple private keys. You own one of the two private keys, the service owns the other private keys. Both of your private keys are required to spend money.
So, if the service tries to rob your coins or gets hacked.. they can't.
In addition, with nLockTime, after a certain period of time the Bitcoin network can automatically refund your multisig coins to a specific address -- in case the service loses their private key. 
This is a true 'wallet as a service':  You have _eventual_ full control of your coins, but in the meanwhile the service is able to block transactions to prevent suspicious transactions, protect against double spending, etc.
Here's how an exchange would go:
"Hey Bob, someone signed with your private key to send coins, and made that request from South Africa. Is that you?" 
"No, that's not me, how can I get my coins back?"
"Just sign a transaction to a secure wallet, we will sign your transaction and we won't sign the attackers."
See -- all the control a wallet as a service would need, without actually giving them control of your coins.
Coinkite is simply a bank, not a wallet.

R. Starr, "Existence and uniqueness of ‘money’ in general equilibrium: natural monopoly in the most liquid asset "
Extract from conclusion:
"Money (the common medium of exchange) arises endogenously as the most liquid (lowest transaction cost) asset"
Note that "transaction cost" is not only the monetary fees, but also cost in the economic sense, including opportunity cost and all risks.
In the context of cryptocurrency, "transaction cost" involves the general adoption (as having to exchange the currency for another brings counterparty risk), network spending / double sending risks (in this context we can simplify risk to cost), etc.
Further reading for you: demand-side economies of scale, which is significant in money.

Satoshi designed the mining algorithm to be fluctating. Satoshi designed the 21 million limit.
The 1 MB is a **resource** of Bitcoin, just like 21 million BTC. While most agree that at the moment 2 MB or so would be fine, however it is not a limit that is meant to fluctuate. It is **supposed** to cap the number of transactions.

@_date: 2015-05-24 03:20:43
The argument was never "spend $50". If you actually read 21's docs, they're expecting that people will only get a million satoshis or so *over a year*.
The point of these ASICs are not to make money. They're to allow you to participate in the blockchain.
Signing a phone contract? That phone company might want a cryptographically signed signature on the blockchain so there's no avenues for dispute.
Laptop stolen? Send 1 satoshi from your phone to a pre-determined address and Prey will automatically lock it. The source of the satoshi authenticates you.
Again, the argument is that people WILL spend $0.01 in electricity for their devices to get enough satoshis to participate in the blockchain. Even if we assume bitcoin's monetary value is $0, it's still worthwhile.
**Read 21's docs. They are talking about 'a million satoshis' tops.**

**There may have been a factual made by the ATO.**
The latest ATO draft rulings, specially [TD 2014/D11]( considers that Bitcoin is not foreign currency as no sovereign recognizes Bitcoin as a unit of account, or a form of payment.


The implications of this are that Australian Bitcoin exchanges must charge 10% GST on the purchase of BTC. Yes, you must pay $550 AUD to buy BTC trading at $500.
This is ruling is factually incorrect. In 2013, Germany's Finance Ministry has recognized Bitcoin as a 'unit of account' and a form of payment. 


As such, Bitcoin should be considered foreign currency, and not be considered supply for GST purchases.

You're missing the point completely. If $0.005 worth of bitcoin derives more value for you than the cost of mining it, then it is worthwhile even if you can get it for cheaper elsewhere.
Do you spend 10 hours shopping around for the lowest prices every time you buy something?
When the amount is small enough, it doesn't matter if there's a huge markup. You're still thinking the sole purpose of having satoshis is for its monetary value -- which is irrelevant when we're taking about a few fractions of a cent worth.

Rollover fees no longer effectively penalize 0 transaction mining. If a miner thinks they're small, the effect of throwing out their node and using it only as a block relay is negligible for them.
This creates another tragedy of the commons situation. Perhaps a rollover period of 4 or 5 would be small enough to still penalise 0 tx headless mining, but large enough to sufficiently mitigate the misalignment in incentives.
One easy solution that may come to mind is just detect 0 Tx blocks! Well, not that simple. A miner will now make junk txes with 1 satoshi fees. Ban that? Penalise that? Now we have another magic number influencing economic behaviour.

My opinion is that Bitcoin has not suffered a crash. Remember the rally to $1200? That was bought by MtGox. We later found out that MtGox operated a trading bot (that artificially purchased 570,000 BTC)[ and drove up the price of "bitcoin" on Gox.
My opinion is that Bitcoin never hit $1200. When the market manipulation of MtGox's bots stopped, the free market has been correcting the price back to where it should be. You'll notice that before the Willy bot started, Bitcoin was around $200.

No, I'm not, but I think I program enough to think that putting critical data (witness root hash) in an unstructured field (coinbase tx) isn't the most elegant idea, and that it appropriately belongs in the block header.
Then there's the fundamental question of "Should we degrade full nodes to SPV-level security for witness transactions?" I think that should be a hard fork.
Finally, I have concerns that complicated scripts like multisig are being significantly subsided compared to simple pay to public key scripts. Multisig transactions take more time to verify, and traditionally has been slightly balanced by their increased TX size (so increased fees), but now SegWit will apply a 0.25x modifier and dramatically reduce the penalty.
If you're using 10x more validation resources, you shouldn't get to only pay 2.5x of the fee.

No, it shouldn't. The orphan rate is a marginal cost of block size, and it will apply some pressure to keep block sizes in check, but I don't think it should be the only limit. From a pure fees / fee market perspective, no hard block cap is the best, but of course that's a *terribly* stupid idea because of centralization.
I believe the profit-seeking behavior of miners will naturally lead to transactions having the highest net fees; the orphan rate contributes to that, even more so for tiny/micro transactions.
@_date: 2017-03-07 10:57:33

The problem with flex cap that I see is just plain why. Technology improves over time according to Moore's law, and what nodes can handle over time improves. That logically means block sizes improve over time. Sorry Luke Jr dialup connections cannot be a full node, this is something called a "tradeoff".
The position of flexcap is that nominally larger blocks need to be punished beyond their significantly increased orphan rate. That can be true for very large blocks where it out-capacities some of the network, but it's certainly not needed for 2 mb blocks today or 8 mb blocks in 5 years.

I'm replying to a commentator who suggests rolling out SegWit even with 5% of the hashpower supporting it. That will result in people losing funds, because there can't be a 2048 block lock in period, and nodes will not assume segwit has activated and hence won't reject blocks spending segwit's anyonecanspends.

Not saying that, it has serious downsides. Just saying the smaller blocks don't create a fee market.
@_date: 2016-01-03 20:44:04
Nope. This is because miners can purposefully orphan blocks that accepts too many transactions. Think of it as gold miners that can veto other mines production. 
For now, the huge subsidy makes this irrelevant, but when the subsidy is close to zero miners will naturally trend towards capturing as much value as possible - - and that includes refusing to build upon the blocks of miners including transactions at marginal costs, or deprioritising them (waiting 25s before mining on them for example). 
@_date: 2016-01-13 08:31:31
Thanks, I stand corrected.
Upon further investigation, it doesn't look like there is any need for a hard fork for this change; although that person might have meant a "client-level hard fork" (ie: network goes along fine, but old clients won't be able to send to new addresses).

Yes, the veto has a cost.
However, keep in mind that in a post subsidy environment, the reward can be very significant and make the cost worthwhile. If miners have a reasonable believe that they will still have X% hashpower in a month or so, then selective orphaning can pay off.

Not true. The idea behind a fee market is you'd essentially have to opt in, or you have the uncertainty of your TX not confirmed /ever/ without wallet hacking because Bitcoin core refuses to implement "Forget my unconfirmed txes after 72 hours so I can resend with a higher fee if I don't have RBF", probably to encourage the use of opt-in RBF.

One important thing to keep in mind is that miners always have the option to soft-cap their blocks. As miners are profit-seeking, they will naturally converge onto a supply and demand equilibrium that results in the most net fees.
A block size is nothing more than a "production quota", and Economics 101 will tell you that production quotas decrease market efficiency and result in less supplier profit. That's because you are limiting the market mechanisms of block space.
**The larger the block cap is, the stronger fee market there is. A fee market is NEVER created by artificially hard-capping blocks, because instead of users bid higher and higher, users will simply stop bidding altogether and use something else.** This results in less demand, and users won't pay more than they have to, resulting in the worst fee market.
There ARE valid reasons for limiting the block size, like centralization concerns. The block cap should be the highest that is acceptable for centralization; fee market plays nothing into this. **Smaller blocks do not create a bigger fee market.**
The bitcoin core devs are brilliant programmers, but they are not economists. Expecting them to have the best understanding of economics is like expecting economists to understand C++ programming.

If we had merged Bitcoin Classic a year ago Bitcoin wold be at least $2000 by now.
There WAS economic majority AND mining majority for Bitcoin Classic.
Core wanted to get it their way, and so members of core (who explicitly represented they were representing Bitcoin Core and NOT just as individuals, this is well documented) offered the HK agreement: SegWit + blocksize hardfork.
They backtracked, and now we have Unlimited.
@_date: 2016-01-17 08:46:33


No. I'm well aware and agree that Peter_R's theories are bunk. However, this doesn't change the fact that the relationship between the max block size and the total fees (in a 0 subsidy environment) is not linear, but a curve of utility that Bitcoin provides and the fee pressure from the block size.
Imagine a 1 kB block cap. Would that provide the most fees? No, because bitcoin then has almost zero value and no one would it.
Likewise, increasing the block cap would only reduce fees if the additional utility created is less than the decreased fee pressure. I believe 2-4-8 is far from the point where the fee market will be hurt; especially since we have decades for the subsidy to be near zero and hardware will certainly scale significantly in the meantime.


That's ignoring that miners need to invest in hardware specific for bitcoin mining, and they will only receive BTC. If they collude, their mined bitcoins can become worthless and this is an incentive against a single pool.


This can be done in better means than limiting the block size and increasing the fee for all transactions. For example, the creation of UXTOs can be punished (in terms of fee policy) while consuming UXTOs rewarded. This can price out all the "leave message in the blockchain as addresses/amounts", "free onchain bitcoin faucets", and using bitcoin as perpetual data storage (except via OP_RETURN, which is prunable) without affecting normal, transactional use.
This can also work against adversarial miners with IBLT or weak blocks, as a miner filling their own block with perpetual data storage will suffer from a much higher orphan rate.
@_date: 2016-01-05 14:23:53
Fortunately the vast majority of the network DOES run core, and miner boycotts (like we've seen with f2pool) is a sufficient deterrent to running RBF.
@_date: 2016-01-03 14:53:06
That's just an example for the "1MB" model. Users won't pay more in fees than they have to, and if users pay less than 0.001 BTC in fees, then users in the "small transactions" group would outbid them. Hence, in that model fees will converge to 0.001 BTC.
My theory of "profit seeking miners will maximize net fees" is just simple supply-demand market equilibrium theory, and any economics textbook (or wikipedia) will explain that.
If miners make more by limiting the block size, then *they will themselves* -- there's no need for a hard cap. While miners are many individual actors, in aggregate they form the supply side and will still result in this behavior.
If miners make more by increasing the block size, then *they can't if there's a hard cap*. Hard caps can only hurt the fee market (net fees).

The surge in bitcoin price has caused a lot of people to sell NuBits. The system has two mechanisms for increasing demand for NuBits and hence keeping the value pegged at $1:
1) Interest rates
Current interest rates for Nubits are 31.35% for 3 weeks. This should have been sufficient.. except
2) Liquidity providers deciding to peg 1 NBT at $0.95
Liquidity providers saw that their reserves were slowly getting depleted, and decided to peg NBT at a 5% offset ($0.95) in order to stop the losses.
For many days, a Nubit was only worth $0.95. This has had the effect of destroying trust in a currency that was supposed to be pegged to $0.99 to $1.01 at all times, and large holders of Nubit were no longer interested in parking and instead sold to the walls.
The creator of NuBit has argued that they need to issue more shares of NuShares and use the raised bitcoins to provide liquidity, keeping the peg.
Some well known liquidity providers have argued that a $0.95 peg is better if it allows the reserves to be kept.

This actually can increase mining profitability by 200%, not 30%. This is because most of the mined coins are used to pay for expenses -- either capital expenditure (depreciation of your miners) or electricity; plus there's pool fees and orphans.
Assume that your margin for mining is 15%. A 30% increase in effective hashrate is equivalent to increasing profits by 200%.

the moderated and open format of the forums attracted 
people from all walks of life. Silk Road was the most 
popular cryptomarket to offer discussion forums. There 
were forums dedicated to testing the purity of the 
product, to safe shipping methods, to safe bitcoin 
practices and, most interestingly, to harm reduction 
strategies and ending addiction to illicit drugs. It’s easy to 
understand why someone involved in an illegal trade 
might want to share best practices and tips on many 
topics. However, what wasn’t expected was that users 
would use the forums to discuss ending their 
dependencies on illicit drugs or reducing the harm caused to themselves.

Not useless:
• Hackers might have a background service or tab running while hacking. It only takes one slip to bring them down. For example, if they are EVER signed into chrome at any point on that OS, then the background updater and Service Workers agent will be continuously polling Google servers with an identifiable token. 
• Datacentres maintain connection logs of IPs on their network and timing. This can be used to deanonymize VPNs. 
• A trick involving clever profiling of anycast-based DNS/IPs allows for the creation of a semi-persistent “cookies”. Many VPN client do NOT flush the dns cache upon connection. This is being used by some security firms to deanonymize VPN users - it can be transparently included as a resource (eg popular CDN resource or other commonly embedded files) for max reach.
