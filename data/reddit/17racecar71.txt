Your comment convinced me I should sell.  Goodbye crypto it’s been fun.      /s
@_date: 2019-07-15 21:44:21
Great answer, thanks for the serious reply.  I also expect something of a slow bleed for the rest of the year.  2020 should be fun
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:35:25
Woooooosh.  To both of you
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:52:18
I was worried until I saw this meme.  Now I’m just curious, at what point should I buy more?
Sub 10k me thinks
@_date: 2018-08-19 05:18:22
Next week
@_date: 2018-08-09 17:02:58
Congrats on your new reddit account!
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:12:50
I’m ok with a delay.  And I just want to give a friendly reminder to all my crypto friends to buy the dip!
@_date: 2018-05-28 16:21:44
I would be stoked if it went to 5k.  So cheap 
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:19:33
We need more new people to adopt and less day traders.
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:00:00
Ranch is my preferred dip, unless you’re dipping chips.   Then I gotta go with guacamole.
@_date: 2019-11-01 06:44:11
Did you not read what OP wrote?
They believe
@_date: 2019-11-17 04:12:04
You turn on the option to get ads in the settings
@_date: 2019-11-21 19:58:08
Will you still be posting on this sub when BTC is valued +20k?  I doubt it
@_date: 2019-11-21 18:31:06
I’m thinking the bottom will be 5.5-6k, my crystal ball told be. If I were OP I’d DCA over the next few weeks and stack sats while it’s cheap
@_date: 2018-10-02 02:22:54
Bitcoin, the new stablecoin
@_date: 2019-11-17 00:14:36
I’ve been telling everyone about Brave, it’s a superior browser.  I left Firefox for it.
Even taking the passive earnings out of the equation I’ve become so used to never seeing ads...YouTube w/o ads it’s an amazing thing.
Edit: why was this post removed!  BAT and Brave are good for adoption, which is good for Bitcoin.  Ah well I hope this doesn’t get removed.
@_date: 2019-11-16 19:27:15
I can only show you the door
@_date: 2019-08-06 04:09:26
I thought twitter but I can’t find it.  Maybe I dreamt he tweeted that.  Thanks dreamland McAfee!
@_date: 2019-08-05 15:33:55
I listen to John McAfee he predicted this rally (/s...kinda)
@_date: 2019-10-27 18:02:23
And the patriots will be the patriots.  I thinks it’s a good bet.
Watch the pats win 21-13.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:35:03
Like leafs in the wind
Edit: is it leafs or leaves?
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:08:10
That’s the expression of someone thinking “why’s this asshole taking my picture?”
@_date: 2019-06-27 06:37:46
I think it will dip, just enough to make some people scared.  I thought it would dip at 10k tho so what do I know
@_date: 2019-10-04 21:25:28
The Brave browser is awesome.  Can’t recommend enough.
@_date: 2019-10-02 21:02:18
No way Jon has the best ending!  He wasn’t exiled, he gets to party in the north with Ghost and Tormund.  That’s exactly where he wanted to be.  Probably shag another few redheads while he’s at it.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:13:11
What do you expect?  We the moon crew
@_date: 2019-06-04 01:03:51
How low do you think it will go?
Look into your crystal ball.
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:11:00
He really shouldn’t be posting how much BTC he has, hackers could get his loot.
@_date: 2019-10-28 01:38:06
Congrats on the win ��
@_date: 2019-06-04 16:28:57
A timeless classic.
It’s like the “don’t you dare sell now” posts after a spike.
@_date: 2019-06-21 16:27:57
I agree that there will be a drop at 10k, I’m thinking a sell-off to 8500 or so.  That’s what the tea leaves told me this morning at least.
Edit:  this comment has not aged well
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:19:27
This is only the beginning
@_date: 2019-04-07 20:30:57
What’s Carl have against “Dumb and Dumber”?  
@_date: 2019-04-05 02:42:30
Brave is, real talk, the best
@_date: 2018-11-22 22:42:59
DCA baby.  DCA
@_date: 2018-03-30 03:52:10
I hodl and bought more today.  Unite!
@_date: 2018-11-15 15:02:26
�� Cuz I’m freeee, free fallin ��
@_date: 2019-01-08 22:57:12
Yes now I’m more bullish than ever
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:35:08
Get some now these prices won’t last!
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:20:09
Bitcoin may be struggling but at least the memes are back.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:48:19
I agree with everything you wrote except the last part...Nick Foles is gonna pull it off!!
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:38:20
You talkin about playoffs??
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:57:09
1 bitcoin = 1 bitcoin
@_date: 2018-07-15 20:35:10
Phencyclidine, it’s called angel dust or pcp, makes some people go a little crazy in the head.  Fighting cops, immune to tasers, stripping naked in blizzards...all kinds of fun things.
@_date: 2018-07-02 19:06:21
But rises again harder and stronger
@_date: 2018-07-11 16:38:57
That’s awesome!!  You have a whole bitcoin :)
@_date: 2018-07-15 18:30:50
If you let your relationship with PCP define you, you’ve already lost.
@_date: 2019-05-23 23:29:24
It’s pretty obvious to me that it will go up or down.  Maybe sideways for a bit.
@_date: 2019-05-25 06:02:19
I agree.  Fuck facebook.
@_date: 2019-05-12 20:33:36
That would be awesome!  I want more.
I hope you are correct.
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:25:53
That’s why this flash crash I reckon.
@_date: 2019-05-30 19:04:33
You are a wise person.
@_date: 2018-12-07 03:29:41
Trumps all about that bitconnect!!  Get it while it’s cheap
@_date: 2018-12-06 15:06:47
No.  It’s the number of years that give btc its intrinsic value.  The longer bitcoin survives the more viable it is an alternative to fiat.  Exciting times, support the revolution!
@_date: 2018-12-30 19:00:37
I know why you choose to have your little group therapy sessions in broad daylight.  I know why you’re afraid to go out at night: The Batman.
@_date: 2019-05-30 17:55:12
I’ve been waiting for that correction for weeks.
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:03:58
Make that 2 years maybe
