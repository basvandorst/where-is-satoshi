Once the drums start rolling for USD, EUR, GBP etc... you'll see all crypto explode in value.

No, just really after reading the thread on bitcointalk, if they have issues with the payouts they should just decline my custom, and perform instant refunds, especialy if your send tx has 200 confirmations! I mean the didn't even roll the dice....
I Know it's &lt;1 BTC, but really WTF
I have tweeted this on their "support" and also I've sent a PM....

Last time I checked, drugs, crime etc. etc. were also using USD. If they declare BTC a "Morally corrupt instrument" then they should also ban USD, oh wait that how THEY make money and have POWER  over us....

Taxes are there just to make 99% of the population poor. It serves no other function. open your eyes, most of the worlds money don't go through those tax laws anyway. 
Don't forget about indirect taxation like VAT.
Our income is taxed 3 times:
Income tax,
and the most important: money printing.
And don't forget: interest rates=0%, inheritance tax, gambling tax, capital gain tax, etc etc...
Meanwhile the rich boys play it safe  Islands with 0% taxes.
This has to stop. It's stupid. There are no other words to describe it.
