If you do not have full control of a wallet's private key, the wallet's funds are not yours, period.

BitCoin got raided! I told you it was a scam! /s

**How does the code avoid duplicate addresses?**
Because BitCoin addresses can be created offline without the Client ever having to talk to the network, how does the code ensure that each address stays unique and that no two Clients create (by total rare and random chance) the same address?

The next step in this thought process was to gather each of the First World countries currencies circulation numbers and calculate the number together.
You're correct in stating that this would only prove to make the value even higher. It's unreal to me how much money has been printed and how much is probably still printed each day.

WHY IS IT SO HARD TO SAY "I DONT KNOW, GREAT QUESTION."?????

So while I geniuenly appreciate the response and while I love seeing stats about the large number of potential wallets, this doesn't answer the question as your response still leaves the potential (albeit incredibly small) on the table that a duplicate could appear. I am sure there is a safe guard in place, but I have yet to see it.
