Ooo, Taleb is one of the great modern thinkers. Many know his book, The Black Swan, but I highly recommend his book about complex systems, including fed reserve and stock market economies, called Antifragile.

His writing is a bit different, perhaps from his background. But his work over the years has contributed some new insights and at least has people thinking more critically of their assumptions.

Antifragile has a bit more of his meandering, conversational style, which to me is more enjoyable to read.

As they say, the best time was yesterday but the next best time is now. Just spend what you don’t mind losing because this is a rollercoaster that we don’t know if it’s about to start or finish.

As you say, the increased leverage of secondary markets can create a more tangled financial web in the broader economy (house of cards fragile). The benefit in traditional, highly traded markets is that the secondary markets find the right price of the underlying asset more efficiently. Liquidity increases which is generally good and should lead to less volatility in the underlying asset. If the goal is to be some sort of asset.

I thought Peterson was trying to point out that it matters more what you do than what you say than avoiding the question of belief in God. And I guess when people are asking that question it is primarily to categorize that person as in-group or out-group, so maybe he is trying to counter that. I get some of that demurring vibe though, too.
