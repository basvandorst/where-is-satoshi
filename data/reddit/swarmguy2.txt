Japan had their inflation up to '87. Massive amounts. This caused their deflation. And their interventions since have kept them in a deflainary depression. Bad debts have not been allowed to clear. The rest of the world is heading that way, if not already there.
China is entering debt deflation as we speak. Their economy is in free fall - every non governmental data source shows this (eg. The Shanghai Composite Index). Adding the yuan to the SDR basket is meaningless in this context.
Every debt inflationary boom ends in a huge bust. Fighting it only exacerbates deflation and depression. The evidence is everywhere, from commodity prices to the bond markets to shipping indexes to consumer credit. It's happening right now

Recessions are caused by inflation, which pulls demand from the future and concentrates wealth, causing subsequent deflation. So yes, saving is a good thing belive it or not. 
Spending for the sake of economic activity and keeping employment in wasteful areas is not a healthy economy. Saving and investing in useful production is.
The current dilemma as you put it is a direct result of the inflationary policies of the past 30+ years and the subsequent interventions of central banks. Scrip currencies always, 100% without failure, go to zero.

This meme that the average joe doesn't care about corrupt banks and govts is nonsense.

If the people you're talking to don't care then they especially need Bitcoin, because they'll get wiped out in the next crisis if they trust the banks and govt

Tl;dr goal-seeked strawman dressed up in an academic paper. They take price discrepencies in fiat denominations across fiat-crypto exchanges and use them to argue bitcoin isn't frictionless. This is clearly not what people mean when they say frictionless, there is no reference to the fiat system. It's either gross misunderstanding or completely cynical
@_date: 2016-03-08 21:38:31
Yes but currency without the store of value property becomes worthless eventually, every single time. Money is both, which is why it's ideal as you say, and should always be strived for, otherwise you get currency crises like we're experiencing in the fiat world

Exactly, but if credit increases without velocity it means real demand for credit is low and it's being forced, which collapses the short term credit increase. Real credit demand increases velocity. But if you're including credit supply in the velocity definition then fine, but that definition runs into problems in the context of complexity economics, which is the best school by far

Unbelievable. This guy is twisting and turning so badly to wrap his head around ownership structures of decentralised apps and their smart contracts, his head comes off!
He talks about centralisation risk for dapps using shared smart contracts that are privately owned. Then says we need blockchain-as-a-service companies to intermediate the smart contracts, which are hosted on centralised servers. Or something. His logic goes off on tangents about how centralisation is bad and what we need is more centralisation.
He can't understand dapps because he's a "bank innovation director" and can't think outside of top down ownership structures, and doesn't seem to be aware of how open source tech works. This is why these "experts" who are coming into this space need to recognise their ignorance, dapps are about complexity and complex adaptive systems, the old ways won't work. Trying to shape them into a centralised system with blockchain service companies acting like the banks do now is betraying the potential of dapps.

Credit supply is enough. The velocity or turnover has no effect on prices if the credit supply is the same. Increasing velocity doesn't necessarily increase credit (increased demand in one area decreases demand somewhere else if the supply is fixed, regardless of speed of turnover). Increasing credit speeds up velocity which is why credit supply is sufficient on its own. Velocity is a symptom not a cause. Mike Shedlock  (aka Mish) explains this well. 
There's the chance we're talking about the same thing if by velocity you actually mean demand for credit.

They make the same mistake of other patronising analysts that millenials like anything new and techy for the sake of it and that we like bitcoin for that reason only. How contactless cards are on par with a new financial system shows how clueless these guys are.
They're also trying to make out that the cashless surveillance society is cool and what millenials want. Again, clueless
@_date: 2016-03-05 20:29:30
I don't think you understand money. Your assumptions on why gold is valuable are wrong. Digital currency that's inflated and reliant on debt growth is no different to other inflated currencies.

The block size issue doesn't relate to inflation , so regardless of the debate the store of value property doesn't change if the block size is increased.

You confuse uncollateralised credit creation inflating unproductive financial assets, creating a dangerous monoculture of concentrated wealth, with transactional record keeping. The latter is what the miners do, transparently. The former, no one should ever do.  Bundling them together to argue in favour of opaque zombie banks is weak.
And you seem to ignore the huge cost of the swift system, comingling etc and poor reconciliation processes in the current banking system. Arguably more expensive than the blockchain and a hell of a lot less reliable, at any scale

It can go one of 3 ways:
1) Sell off since there will be a scramble for dollars both chasing higher yield and for margin calls.  People won't want to sell their btc but they may have to in order to meet obligations as global credit unwinds. Same goes for gold.
2) Go higher if it's perceived as a safe haven from collapsing credit and markets. History so far tells us not.  There was speculation from the Greek crisis but that popped not long ago
3) Stay the same as a mix of the above or if a rate rise is already priced in
My bet's on no. 1 for the short term, 2 for the long

Something needs to happen to switch people's thinking away from custody, transx fees, speed, and even micropayments, and into the big picture.  But at the moment the energy/capital still rests with control festishers who are fixated on incremental improvement thinking.
The Silicon Valley style move-first-then-monopolize-the-network-with-centralized-servers thinking just doesn't fit Bitcoin.  It's just a hipster version of banker thinking, and it's looking passe now.
Over time the public will realize how P2P sound money is completely different (permissionless economy), but for the time being we have to put up with Old World Order custodial thinking until it's fully obsolete, which won't happen until the network economy can be held up and shown in it's full glory, and we're quite far from that point right now.

The supply quantity is irrelevant. Prices will adjust in the market and the btc themselves will be divided up more and more as supply becomes more constrained. 
It will enrich holders when denominated in fiat but ultimately it's not about quantity it's about value.
I'd much rather this than an inflationary system where those creating the new supply are enriched for doing nothing (i.e banks today)

Although I agree with the sentiment of the article, we don't actually live in a fractional reserve lending world. It's actually a no - reserve lending system. 
Banks don't take your money and lend it out, they lend first then cover capital reserves with treasuries etc afterwards. This lending out of thin air creates deposits in other banks and adds to the total supply of credit and currency.  It has the effect of redistributing purchasing power from savers to themselves (and the borrowers until repayment), it's like counterfeiting.
My point is that the system is even worse than fractional reserve lending, and worsens concentration of wealth even more.  Bitcoin is definitely an alternative fairer solution
