I'm going to open a nab account tomorrow and as soon as the debit card has arrived I'm going to tell my employer to pay my salary into the new account. Then I'm going to close my commonwealth bank account.

They're not giving a reason. All they told me was that they've blocked bitstamp's iban

I wanted to share this because it's taken me a couple of weeks to get everything set up and then the bank has done this and rendered all that work redundant. I'm kinda upset about this. The bank isn't providing me with the service I signed up for and the transfer is just to another bank in London, so I don't understand why CBA has got a bee in their bonnet.

They put a block on my Internet banking shortly after my experience.

I understand a question asked multiple times can be frustrating and I apologize. Still, a supportive attitude wouldn't go amiss. Moaning at people doesn't really help with that.

will do

@_date: 2013-11-01 02:21:19
I will. Thank you.

I think you're right.They're scared of Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-11-01 02:20:21
Thank you so much. You have been very helpful and that's very appreciated.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:28:25
You got that right. Bitcoin has the potential to literally strip central banking and states of their power overnight.

So it's possible to deposit AU funds into btc-e? Please explain.
@_date: 2013-12-08 21:25:42
I'm going to let them know that I'm not happy that they're deciding wwhat I can do with MY money.

I tried to transfer the maximum daily amount of $2000. After talking with a customer service rep a few hours ago I'm certain that this has nothing to do with protecting my interests and everything to do with protecting the bank's interests.

I'd like to think that this was true but I've spoken to the bank and they point blank refused to allow the transfer. Also, we all like to think that our money in the bank is our money but what happens is that when we deposit money into a bank we are giving the bank a loan, making it their money to do with as they please.

Awesome, Thanks

I'm aware that there services exist but I'm put off by the fact that their bitcoins are like $100 or more over priced at the time of sale.
