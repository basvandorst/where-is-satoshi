HEY way to google "rent is better than buying a house" and giving me the first 4 articles. fun fact, if you do the same but type in "buying a house is better than renting" you'll get a whole new set of articles. fucking dumbass.
and i live in the bay area, too. so i know you are full of shit. alameda, concord, contra costa county, martinez, and SO many cities around here are affordable. don't get me wrong, its still the most expensive in the whole country ON AVERAGE, but its definitely not 800,000 minimum. nice try. maybe if you're looking in san francisco, berkeley, or san jose. but hey, you're from the bay, so you should know all this, too. 
and you're just so wrong about the advantages of buying. you just have to do some research and you might get it.. or just keep renting and keep making us landlords rich ;)
either way... keep investing friend. bye

So...how do we buy a house?

I mean... Paying rent is also a horrible idea. Mainly to the fact that you are literally just paying the landlords morgage. There is no good solution, but having a morgage is better than paying rent from an asset and ROI standpoint

yikes. i think you have it all wrong.. check out some investment in real estate literature. never have i ever heard "renting is better than buying a home" and jesus christ, $500,000 for a house? no wonder you're so outraged at buying a house, you automatically assume like the highest morgage price for your example lmao.
