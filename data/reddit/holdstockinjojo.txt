I can show pics of everything except my savings account (my bank doesn't allow screenshots)

Probably not a bad idea I'm kinda jumpy, I'm sure it'll hit 13 again and be back down in 30 min

If that was supposed to read as 2 messed up things, then yes you're correct

I took a peak earlier today just cause it was chaos but I've had an eye on bitcoin since I was buying stuff from the silk road in highschool

I would love to but I'm planning on taking a portion out in about a year exactly idk how much yet but I'm also planning on adding some to fill in the dips, this whole thing will be monitored carefully but iron hands kept in mind, I made it through today (my first day) so I think I can handle it

Never go full retard... Jk but I'm extremely lucky to be in a situation where if I lost everything I'd still be able to get by. I warned every cent other than a birthday here and there so it'd be heartbreaking, but not the end if the world

Thanks I got tired of looking at the bitcoin timeline and going wow I wish I joined then and then realized that there is a good chance people will be saying that about right now 10 years from now so it was kinda a F it moment... Not like it's impossible to liquidate but like I said HODL is the path I'm trying
@_date: 2019-06-27 02:55:25
There's not many people on this subreddit with that opinion I respect you saying that and I plan on taking that advice to some extent

I bought 5000 roughly 3 hours before crash cause I thought it tapered off yesterday

So I've been watching for a while and always thought it was too risky and the time to buy already passed and I thought that to myself Everytime I'd check and I got sick of that and decided to stop regretting a lack of action. That and I've been doing research into how bitcoin actually works and I was pretty much sold when I realized it's become a finite currency at some point and I knew when that approached prices would skyrocket that and I have a great paying internship that if need be I could build up savings again from

I bought about half a coin last night when I figured it was done settling, HODL here I come
