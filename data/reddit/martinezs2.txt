Hello! There are many secure platforms, such as [kraken.com]( [binance.com]( [cryptocoin.pro]( Besides these are many other platforms and you can read about more of them. I personally are registered with cryptocoinpro. It seemed to me the most advantageous and safer platform. Plus they have very good prices and low fees. After I used binance for a while, I said to try another platform and know that I was happy with the offers and the support offered. Good luck!

There is not a specific time when you have to buy, you can pursue its fluctuations and when you think it's the good price then you buy.

You can try [cryptocoin.pro]( you can buy by credit card or bank transfer and you can keep the coins on them on your platform in your personal wallet whenever you want.  I personally have been using their services for 2 months, and any operation I've been doing now is very fast and I have not had to wait for a long time.

 Hello, I buy bitcoin and ether from the cryptocoin.pro platform and am pleased. You can buy when you want and keep them on the platform or in your personal wallet. Prices are very good, and the verification process is very fast compared to other platforms. Also, if you have some blur, you can always address them. When I registered a problem occurred and I did not know how to solve it and I turned to them. In a few moments I received an answer how to fix the problem.

Even though we can now use crypto in some countries to buy a good piece of material, I think that in the future we are going to expand the domains where we can buy / sell something with crypto.
