Honestly, I would consider that financial overhaul and gaining the discipline to implement more mature avenues of spending to be more valuable than any money you lost during this temporary drop (although of course it is always extremely disheartening to put massive effort into something and not have the outcome you were having in mind). I'm a young adult and I really need to start making life changes like you have more than I need a couple grand. So kudos to you on leveling up your life. The money will come shortly, when the bitcoin train goes back up as it always has.

Can I ask why you would buy more in the case of a hard fork? Wouldn't that make two separate coins?

Which exchange are you using? That sounds amazing

Also there're a few steps you need to take to ensure that your BTC duplicate (basically, get a hard wallet like a USB stick and configure it to support both sides of the fork), because some exchanges only support one side of the fork, meaning that you'll only have either old BTC or only new BTC - and if the other side ends up becoming the dominant one, all your coins in that exchange will be worthless.

Ahh I see. Can I ask what exchange you use?

How do you create a sell order? Is it an app that does it for you?

What's preventing you from choosing a hardware wallet over the method you described though? Afaik hardware is the safest method to use, and once we start really getting into BTC we're gonna have to get one eventually anyway

What is laddering?
@_date: 2017-06-26 22:24:54
You absolutely do not want to buy ANY BTC for a week or two after the split, as you do not know whether the new BTC or the old BTC is the one that will prevail. Your coins get duplicated one time so that you have an equal amount of old and new BTC, but after that it'll be a complete gamble to purchase BTC as you will have to make the choice between buying the old or new BTC. Of course, if you purchase the one that ends up winning, you'll probably make some profit, but if you choose wrongly, everything you purchase could end up worthless.

What's a trezor, and what made you choose it over similar competitors?
@_date: 2017-06-27 00:08:07
You will have 2 BTC, 1 old BTC and 1 new BTC. Both will have their own value - you'll essentially own two different coins. This has already happened before with Ether, which is why you see an Ether and Ether Classic, I'm assuming the classic is the old ETH. Notice how ETH is worth a lot while Classic is worth almost nothing.

Ohh I see, yeah I haven't checked any of the prices so I wasn't aware. As long as whatever wallet you use is enforcing both sides of the fork, it should be fine. You can find out by contacting the support team

Yes, you're correct. However the most likely result is that one will die.

I think your knowledge of wallets is ahead of mine, I don't know any of what you said in the last sentence lool. Afaik, we need to keep our BTC in a wallet that supports both the BIP148 chain and the legacy (i.e. current) chain
