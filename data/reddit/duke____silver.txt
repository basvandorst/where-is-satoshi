Become a dark net vendor. 
@_date: 2015-12-23 04:00:13
What makes you think that?
@_date: 2015-06-20 05:06:26
You will find most of them share a similar mindset as bitcoin folk.

Isn't a killer just a killer?
@_date: 2014-07-06 21:29:15
Exactly. This guy is asking for someone to make him a shirt and then donate for him.

I'm sure they just say it's a bot so that cops hopefully don't come knocking on their door. Sounds better than man spends $100 a week on drugs from the darknet and takes pictures of his address.

You should edit your original comment. I'm sure plenty of people won't see 's addition.

The point is, you buy this and support the network while making a few coins back. Then after a few weeks/months you sell the hardware and get make a small profit.
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:58:30
This 100%
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:23:12
My guess is that the people buying these on ebay have heard great things about them, but aren't 100% up to date on new hardware releases. Also the people who want to pay with dollars.
@_date: 2014-06-30 17:16:35
Check ebay right now for antminer S1's. People are still paying $200+ for them.

Plan and simple, anything with the Silk Road name is a scam and just trying to lure in noobs who have heard of the name.
is where you will find any true Silk Road successor. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 16:17:20
No way. I think it looks great.

Actually, a husband and wife can't be charged for the same crime.

Can we stop talking about this troll? Why does anyone care what he does? Just don't use his shit. 
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:14:00
Was the name changed so that you wouldn't be associated with Agora the darknet market?
@_date: 2015-11-02 19:30:26
This is all wrong. They are selling what was in the silk road hot wallet when Ross was arrested. There is still a wallet that (presumably Ross knows the password to decrypt) contains Ross's cold storage from his profits. That is what a rogue agent is supposedly trying to get with a plan to kidnap is sister and mother.

Oh please. Don't be so dramatic.

Best bitcoin meme.

Another vote for electrum. It's the perfect mix of simplicity and having great features.

Not sure what it costs to make, but I'm sure you could find a tutorial somewhere.

FYI all miners say this to prevent people from starting and raising the difficulty.
