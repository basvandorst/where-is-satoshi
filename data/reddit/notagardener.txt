Let us do a thought experiment here. There are currently ~17million bitcoin in circulation. What percentage of the worlds population possess that particular coinage? When bitcoin becomes the standard currency, how will someone without enough bitcoin buy a house or a car? Do you think they might *cough*, borrow some of that savory gravy of crypto-coinage freedom from a *be your own bank* (read "breaks your legs") kind of lender?


When we all take the aromatic incentive to save up a pile of steaming crypto instead of using our hard-earned currency to *demand* some of the finer things, how will anyone get paid for their services? Do we all just cluster an array of FPGAs in the closet and hope the blockchain takes the trash to the landfill?




How so? I think this analogy is poor. Conceptually, banking is much bigger and more complex than a fax machine. Unless bitcoin somehow eliminates demand, there will always be someone in need of a little more, and another someone with a likely usurious offer ready to capitalize.




What type of reading should I be doing? If I didn't understand crypto-currency I might like the idea. Admittedly I could have missed something, but reductio ad absurdum is an easy rhetorical exercise. Try it, maybe you'll be able to help me understand how this superior currency helps a Nepali village with no electricity participate in a global economy?

For the speculators sure. But for the average citizen of the world, access to a computer with internet is incredibly limited. It's not really all that revolutionary. We just trade bankers for early adopters of bitcoin. Bitcoin isn't eradicating poverty here.

Bitcoin *is* fiat currency. 


We all have an interest in how resources are shared and distributed. This is why democracy exists.
@_date: 2018-08-18 21:28:44
Ok. What sort of superior monetary properties does it have?
@_date: 2018-08-17 14:05:38
Exactly. I want the economy to be equitable rather than arbitrarily reward speculators.

[Recommending a book is great if the source is credible and recognized as an expert]( I am not interested in an argument that is essentially a throwback to the gold standard. It is an antiquated standard that has been abandoned for the preferential fiat for many a good reason.
It appears to me that your introduction to currency and economic models is through bitcoin, so you don't realize it's a throwback to gold-standard style currency. It's the same old currency pig with lipstick on it. The real currency revolution already happened when we separated currency from some arbitrary commodity placeholder like gold or whatever random scarce and valuable commodity you prefer to place here. There are serious advantages to a money supply that can change in supply and velocity.
Furthermore, I encourage and invite you to try and produce a well-reasoned argument in your own words instead of recommending a book that openly discusses it's own historical shortcoming.

Are you incapable of seeing the similarities? People still gotta borrow money to buy a home or a car. Are the neo-rich bitcoiners going to be more benevolent with the share of the economy they control? Or will they use economic dominance to maintain wealth? How does the transition away from traditional banking toward blockchain help a poor family in nepal who's village doesn't have electricity? How does it help an impoverished inner city family to be able to pay rent in bitcoin? Does it make getting a decent job easier?
Ultimately, bitcoin doesn't change much. There will still be investment accounts and bankers to manage them. There will still be credit systems, and much of the capital leveraged will still come from investment firms where bankers calculate risk (gamble) on securities like home, auto, small business loans, insurance, etc..
The economy will still be subject to over-speculation and subsequent market crash. Investors with bad assets can still potentially lose their retirement savings when the Misbehavior of Markets is severe enough. At least we can draw cool fractal patterns from the chaos!
How is bitcoin changing any of the problems we truly have with currency anyway?

Oligarchs control government by controlling discourse. They own the media. They own the land and resources extracted from said land. They own the factories and the farms. They own and use these assets to influence voters. They don't need to buy politicians, they only have to shape a narrative.


How does replacing the central banking system with cryptocurrency change the relationship oligarchs have with the wealth producing assets they own? 


In general, I'm not a fan of neoliberal economics. My point is that crypto currency will not change who controls government.
@_date: 2019-08-08 03:09:27


I disagree. It's the wealthy, who control government, that are the rulers. Most importantly, bitcoin as currency does not change the relationship that the oligarchy has with productive assets. 


This is a naive understanding of monetary policy. Inflation provides incentives to reinvest, while deflationary currency is an incentive to hodl.
Without government using taxpayer contributions to fund risky research endeavors, projects like bitcoin couldn't exist.
I'm not arguing against bitcoin as a value store. It's success as a speculative investment is well documented. I'm just pointing out that regardless of the currency, the Koch's and Soroses of the world will still be able to control government with their enormous wealth.

So you're saying that selfish speculation is more important than knowledge, healthcare, poverty, homelessness, malnutrition, economic coercion, and liberty? I can only assume you don't really even understand cryptographic systems, let alone why cryptography as a currency is ultimately flawed. Speculation is the enemy of a truly free market.

What do you mean by "effective" and how does that relate tothe question? how does bitcoin eliminate the "rulers"?


What do you mean by "leverage"? And how does bitcoin impact said leverage?

BTC for the rich who can afford more bandwidth and faster computers.
@_date: 2019-08-06 20:19:09


That's reaching. Bitcoin is yet another evolution in currency. It doesn't really displace the "rulers" at all. They still own the means to produce nearly every commodity you desire. That power transcends currency. Bitcoin is not going to topple governments. It's not going to eliminate the banking system. It won't bring the corporate structure down. It's only real value is in speculation. The smarter long-term investment is always gonna be real estate (until the communist revolution executes the uncooperative kulaks). Like all fiat currencies, bitcoin is only valuable because people believe it to be valuable. To eliminate the rulers, you'll need a (likely violent) revolution.


I get it. The cryptographic hash of a block appended to the cryptographic hash of a block appended to the cryptographic hash of a blo... and then copied amongst nodes around the globe, each verifying the others "work" is definitely a huge waste of computional power, energy, disk space and bandwidth for the sake of redundancy. It's brilliant, like a Rube-Goldberg Machine; If only those resources were commited to SETI or some kind of distributed computing research to cure cancer or eliminate alzheimers disease, or \[***shudders***\] end homelessness and malnutrition. Maaaaan, what kind of superiority complex do these selfish losers have to think that HODL is a ***contribution*** to liberation?
I digress. Evangelists gonna evangelize.

This tu-quoque argument you're presenting is a distraction from a more insidious idea that is not defendable.


Tell me how bitcoin does anything other than replace one fiat currency with another.
@_date: 2019-08-07 02:44:44
I'm very much aware of how blockchain works. So we replace government issued currency for the superior bitcoin. How does that liberate us from the "rulers"?

Is Bitcoin resilient to solar flares?

A smart person knows how to use reductionist arguments that appeal to an ignorant audience.

Bitcoin isn't really relevant in communist terms. Currency is arbitrary. Communists are more concerned with who owns the means of production.

I currently have 0.001729 BTC without any personal investment. Many folks with bitcoins are quite generous. Otherwise, there are a lot of one-off sites that will contribute some change to your bitcoin wallet with minimal effort.
