Bitcoin isn't just about the exchange rate with fiat. Look instead to signs of acceptance and adoption, or resilience to attacks. The value will follow

Dzimbeck keeps stating in trollbox that he's working on one, but i'm not holding my breath.  I can't see them catching on with daytraders because  any additional lag is unacceptable for the more advanced bots.  I'm not an advocate of the current system by any means, but I see this as a way to keep crypto going while we work on a better way.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:32:51
Gox wasn't the hub around which Bitcoin revolved that you make it out to be. And you have it backwards, the regulations controlling money transfer business led to significant barriers to entry for any competition to gox. Less regulation would have led to greater options for Bitcoin, though this calamity will be used to usher in regs.

Sending some coin your way, have had a verified account for months. I really like the default 2fa, wish more would follow your lead. Is your banking relationship secure in light of BMO's announcement earlier this week? 
@_date: 2014-02-16 06:45:56
Because its possible that many coins were stolen
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:53:49
If someone paid even 10 cents on the dollar of Gox liabilities then depositors could at least have gotten something back. Who's gonna take on that level of risk just for a ruined brand though. 
@_date: 2014-04-27 04:09:55
It is a federal offense to deface currency 
@_date: 2014-03-05 16:38:54
I am equally disgusted by the smug gloating that went on while people were losing millions of dollars on gox, but that is not a problem of the protocol. That is a concern that should be directed to humanity as a whole. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 06:34:23
If you did this you'd circumvent the very security that provides Bitcoin with value
@_date: 2014-02-25 06:26:43
I did at first, but more and more I'm starting to believe that they actually lost 750k coins. As hard as that is to believe.

Do you ask for only bills that have never been used for illegal activity when withdrawing from a bank? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:04:56
Sure, because ndas prevent rumours or leaks. Come on guy. He queried the potential investors and none were interested when they discovered the scope of liabilities on the gox books. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 06:03:13
Never had a problem, sold a few last peak and withdrew money in a couple days. Backlog with verifications now, unfortunately.

Withdrawals were halted during that time frame, and for those numbers to be accurate then every single stuck transaction had to be a malicious double withdrawal using the malleability vulnerability on gox.

All the other options do not allow an individual to directly control their transfer of value, but rather rely on third parties to process the transaction. And I know you're quoting, but first/second/third world designations are archaic. It refers to West/Communist/Independent respectively. Developed/undeveloped is more accurate now. You're quoting a poorly written and specious criticism. Not that there aren't valid concerns, but these aren't.

@_date: 2014-03-07 23:53:47
But even the ideology of the developers of a technology cannot imbue a mechanistic process with intrinsic ideology. Rather that comes from the community. A phone isn't ideological. A car isn't ideological. The Internet isn't ideological. They all fostered revolutions in the human domain and can facilitate political movements, but as  non-thinking processes they themselves can only be described as such.

This is due to the ddos/xaction malleability attack. They are concerned that withdrawals were altered so as to seem incomplete but had actually gone through. They patched quickly, but I'm sure they're overwhelmed by how many transactions they need to check. Patience is key here.

The problem with those valuations is the difficulty in converting doge to local fiat vs the comparable ease for Bitcoin, and the difficulty in obtaining Bitcoin now vs large bag holders of doge who cannot easily convert large amounts to viable currencies and still need to donate in order to promote their coin to increase liquidity. This is comparing apples and oranges.

+1 for a wonderfully painful smile, and humour is a motivator for me, so here goes. I'd start by outlining in broad strokes the problem of [double spending]( as it pertains to digital Currency. Briefly introduce [public key Cryptography]( and explain that Bitcoin wallets make use of this technology. Then highlight the troubles experienced by [underbanked]( individuals and that Bitcoin can provide access for people in that position. End with some quirky fact, perhaps by [comparing Bitcoin network power to that of the 500 most powerful supercomputers](

Last reply. An institution can only be called such if it has a human component.  That human component contains the ideology.  The bricks, mortar, bits, and bites do not.

I've responded about half a dozen times to comments exactly like this. For my opinion on the distinctions between people and machines, look there.

So he issues a warning. Big whoop. Think gox users or anyone else in Bitcoin needs someone who is not to warn them about the dangers of shady exchanges? 
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:15:24
Ugh, great time to be locked out of my exchange account for screwing up my 2fa a couple times in a row
@_date: 2014-02-27 02:40:48
Really interested in reading your full post. It should come as no surprise at this point that Mark is capable of this kind of deception. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 05:29:59
And for the love of all that is good read the sidebar on wallet security. After the Gox debacle everyone should maintain control of their private keys for all crypto that isn't being actively traded on an exchange.

Dumbass. There are so many regs regarding money transmitting business. To assert this was an unregulated market is a fundamental lack of understanding. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 19:11:36
Yeah, I'm moving my alt coin to vault, I just wish they had alt/btc trading pairs
@_date: 2014-02-14 06:50:48
You're an idiot 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:06:31
Yeah, I was a bit of a hypocritic there. I'm saying what I wish I felt rather than the complexities of reality. Bitcoin is both, acceptance and value; they are inextricably entwined and the latter will influence the former. To answer your first question: I think we are more strong as an industry for going through the gox fiasco. My guess, and it is a total guess, is that we will see a flat March and a good summer. Ath? I don't know, but I'm still bullish. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:38:27
Even removing the word insolvent after a few minutes was too slow. Using that word was a big, big mistake without proof.

I don't trust my car to make ethical choices, but I still drive. Banks are constructed with a single purpose, and the cogs within simply filling the institutional roles necessitated by the organizational structure.

@_date: 2014-04-19 03:13:14
So? For crypto to succeed it must appeal to and function for a broad spectrum of users. That's like saying everyone who drives a Ford has to espouse the philosophy of Henry Ford. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 01:37:51
No amount of incompetence would allow that to happen. It's just not realistic. And that kind of info would never be bandied around in a memo. A malfunctioning hot wallet could never access coins in cold storage. It's complete bullshit
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:27:24
...you just did. And reporting doesn't require proof, just evidence. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:43:14
Daaaaaamn. You've hit gold twice now on gox scoops. Did he really lost 750k coins? I still find that so hard to believe

Saved, so I can rub it in when you're shown to be wrong long term
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:24:03
Seems cautiously optimistic. They acknowledge the use and attractions of Crypto-Currency, but then go on to list the 'dangers' of currency. 
Excellent analogy to Internet in 95! Wonderful! 
And they are concerned about losing the market! This is good! 
@_date: 2013-11-24 18:55:09
Your story made my day, congratulations! :-)

150 dollar drop on cavirtex, damn I wish I had money on that exchange 
damn you localbitcoins! Let me on! I want buy!

Try checking LocalBitcoins.com to see if any local vendors are dumping there. I got a few for 75 that way right after the Silk road shutdown

Only today? This place is a seething bag of speculators, absent the original goal of beating a new path of direct control and friction less transfer of value. The daily cost of btc is unimportant. What matters is adoption. If this reduced price allows more people in, then it makes me happy, regardless of the loss of tens of thousands.

best bet for a canadian atm is cavirtex.com.  Vaultofsatoshi.com is based in canada, but hasn't yet implemented $cdn.  If you're in a rush, localbitcoins will suffice. we're in a serious downtrend right now, so you can hover on localbtc and look for someone who hasn't tied their price into an avg and scoop them up when you think the trough has bottomed out.

Yup, but in their opening preamble there were comments stating essentially: we are working within our existing frameworks, but would welcome additional reach.  When responding to questions however, they seem very confident.

A pyramid scheme is when that which is being sold has no value or use. I believe that an alternative currency has great value. Apropos op's premise, this sub is shit, and should be the last place anyone seeking an introduction to Crypto-Currency should turn.

I remember mining a few on my PC in mid 2010 I think, by then it wasn't as easy, but I got a few, and they're gone. I never dreamed it would take off, I just thought it was a neat idea that might lead to something one day; not that it itself would succeed. I bought in after April, sold one for a thousand dollars on Monday. One. A grand. It still blows my mind.
