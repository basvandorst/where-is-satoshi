Wrong. Bitcoin Core developers are only a part of broader community around open protocol. Appearance of Blockstream altered disposition of people in the space a lot through the last couple of years


I didn't suggested that it's an uncontroversial event, reread my comments. If u are asking me why I support 2x - to improve transaction capacity and to lower the cost of transacting. Costs of running full node have nothing to do with Bitcoin security model


I disagree. We shall see

@_date: 2017-10-25 22:23:09


Disagree. Miners can eliminate those losses only if pool is able to propagate their blocks on the network at the level of other pools and no pool has unlimited resources. Hence, bottleneck: pool shows what its capable of in case of propagation and getting headers from the network and miners sign in and start working


Miners can't mine indefinite blocks, right? If pools couldn't broadcast 800Kb blocks efficiently, if other pools could win during unsuccessful propagation, 1MB block would never be mined 


If Ghash.io case was more complex than self-shrinking which I doubt, I need to read more, than we just hadn't tested lasting 51% situation yet. NYA doesn't count, wallet processors which serve merhcnats can't deal with ever-increasing fees. I expect greed, short-sightedness and malicious intent from miners and still see no problem with mining as security model. If u see any flaws, u'd work on PoW replacement.

No, nobody is signaling "1x chain only" in my understanding. Miners are doing business which requires heavy investments, they're doing if for profit, politics is the last thing they'll be engaged in. That's why they often silent about unraveling drama with name calling on both sides and only signal their intentions

@_date: 2017-10-25 20:23:13


No. Bitcoin transaction in absence of a block limit **isn't a common good**. Winning miner have absolute power over its confirmation and he's playing a game of limited resources to hatch the block and spit it out faster than anyone else
Let's setup thought experiment: We have many miners. Their mempools identical - network well-connected. We've empirical data: there always will be some txs with fees - before limit was hit, fee market existed for years even though miners got rewarded anyway, so I don't count "we need overload to provide fees for miners" argument as valid. So we have no overload
Possible situations:
1) 1kkk txs with 0 fees arrives. Winning miner now has to calculate how many of those can be included in a block in order to deliver such block to his competitors **earlier** than they find a new one, and they will be doing the same calculations witnessing mempool's high load while mining, putting even more pressure on current winner. If he tries not to discriminate, he will lose his current winning ticket and waste external resources for nothing
2) Gigantic txs with or without fees. Same rules apply

NYA stats is the best approximation. In the end market will tell us true share


Timing? Years of debate and constant overload prior to NYA. Replay protection? Whoever interested in survival of minority chain 'd implement that. No supporters of 2x so far showed major interest in that. As a user I'm interested in the fastest end of chain split possible


No one is irreplaceable. Bitcoin is faceless and trustless. And Bitcoin itself may be not a perfect solution and other open blockchain might overtake leadership in space in the future. I'm not a maximalist


If this happens, market will come up with a solution like it did with Bitcoin itself. I see no malicious intentions in NYA, quite the contrary: companies who brought Bitcoin to millions have skin in the game and need additional scaling right now for better customer experience and for the profits. When currency is working, it's invisible

@_date: 2017-10-22 18:54:10
Bitcoin was performing below the limits just fine for years. Only miners can and should discriminate which txs worth propagating. Game theory works


There's nothing common about Bitcoin transaction. Miner has absolute power over its propagation, u need to construct your tx in such a way to persuade the miner to propagate it. Too big in limitless block? Miner will calculate can he propagate it fast enough to not lose the main chain and if he can't do it with his hardware and connections to other mining nodes, your tx goes away from his mempool
There's no apriori spam on the network. Network is censorship resistant

51% attack is a danger of imminent double-spend, and we are pretty much protected from it by game theory (unless 100% miners will collude, chain splits). To rewrite the ledger u need not only hashrate, but time also

**How to scale Bitcoin?** What is better: bigger blocks or forced L2 with overload? All questions average people 'd ask Andreas, for example, pop up from time to time in r/btc. Prior to the HF, drama will only get more intense, so I'd not count for more ideas until civil war is over
@_date: 2017-10-25 20:31:38
No, it's misunderstanding of mining

Right. This civil war has little tech issues and much more political issues. "Who has control? Who 'd have control?" are the questions and people give different answers. Mine is "Miners" to both

Disagree. Protocol is open (!), anyone can run software they choose or write their own. Like Andreas well put talking about Bitcoin


There's no property or registered brand to begin with. No legal field and can't be, thanks God. From the moral perspective only Satoshi can say what 'd be called Bitcoin in the end, but he's silent. I like Andreas' version: Trustnet, though

@_date: 2017-10-25 12:45:08


Nakamoto consensus existed before Blockstream's inception and no amount of moral panic will change anything
Software develops like species in evolution, messy. Coders aren't Gods who rule us, u have it backwards. Almost every coder starts with strong intentions of writing his own everything, but no one really can do it. Guys like Bill Gates, Linus Torvals or Satoshi Nakamoto are exceptional geniuses and even they can't write everything. I recommend to watch visualization of github repositories through time. It's unbelievable how often big parts of previous code are being cut for no reason on the surface
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:40:28

No, cos miners are independent actors. Each one of them has to have revenue to cover waste of external resources and profits to expand business to withstand competition from all the others. That's decentralization. Bitcoin is anti-fragile cos miners unable to conspire. Even if miner will come up with perfect theory of reduced inflation which reward him in the long term neither he nor group of miners can execute it without losing competition
51% can do anything, but they have to make it public cos there're too many miners and they will be judged by economic majority. Bad judgment (losing market share first and all value second) will turn into materialization of capital risks of mining. Bankruptcy!
Overload hurted Bitcoin's market share, but its inertia and, maybe partially introduction of Segwit, allowed the first open blockchain to grow in relation to USD much bigger
@_date: 2017-10-27 15:12:08
Thank u for your vigilance
@_date: 2017-10-25 11:45:53
That's your choice. I see no need for any big upgrades in Bitcoin's code, just bug fixing whenever it's found by bug hunters. It worked flawlessly until overload occurred and without complicated Segwit
Any L2 implementations 'd not touch the first layer as it was prior to overload IMO
@_date: 2017-10-27 16:56:16


Why 'd I want that? I'm a libertarian, whoever is the current "great politician" has to have as little power over me as possible. People are different and Power's law applies to money as well as to any creative-related field


I'm counting only on it. Opinions of poor people never mattered and never will. Poor people die in wars, in revolutions, in famines, on the streets, being ill, and always can take personal responsibility and make something of what little they have. I was very poor and I've no sympathy to modern compassion. Charity &gt; state

@_date: 2017-10-27 16:04:39
Thank u for engaging in dialogue. I upvote it


No, it's not. Businesses like Coinbase rely partly on unrestricted growth. Only when limit was hit the furious drama began


Only market itself can find equilibrium between all the characteristics


I strongly disagree. Show me mathematical model or let market figure it out. I welcome p2p and L2 competition. Going to bigger blocks doesn't prevent anyone from working on LN project, Counterparty and so on


Nope, bigger transaction capacity which automatically lowers fees and friction - that's what corporations like Coinbase want, that's what I want to. Amount of listening nodes has nothing to do with Bitcoin security model
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:03:07


Wrong. They aren't using blockchain **as u like them to use it**, they can choose intermediaries for convenience, security (poor and stupid people don't have secure machines and often unable to setup one), out of ignorance of for any other reason. Maybe it's someone's first day in Bitcoin. Maybe it's grocery store which needs to cut the friction and doesn't give two shits whether it's Bitcoin, Ripple or Fed's notes. Maybe it's proponent of disintermediation who currently have no p2p economic activity for specific reasons, converts part of paycheck into Bitcoin and buys food with Bitcoin debit card, doing what he can to push adoption to witness more p2p later
Bitcoin is about choice
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:49:28


When the blockchain is stopped to be open? Maybe we have to think about implementing casts like in India?
@_date: 2017-10-24 11:07:13
Coinbase wants to please both sides and escape as much negative blowback as possible. Coinbase's business model still relies on non-overloaded Bitcoin. Nothing's changed, but hysteria around HF will just get bigger and bigger

**Right!** People don't care about underlaying principles. EVER. What % of Internet users can say anything about TCP/IP stack? Bitcoin prevailed cos it's useful, artificial limit is the reason of greater friction, thus, Bitcoin's market share fall. In big numbers people = money and market flows towards the pathway of the least resistance
Higher fees wouldn't turned Bitcoin into pristine multinational settlement layer, they 'd erased Bitcoin from the map of open blockchains. But it won't happen, 2x will

Miners generally interested in bigger blocks, for sure. I don't see any problems: instead of artificial limit of 1MB, equilibrium between supply and demand of blocksize will be reached by pools' broadcasting ability bottleneck. Connections between pools is the backbone of the network, not small listening nodes. And there'll be competing pools for it too, forever. Ghash.io self-shrinked by application of game theory: miners (and pool itself) can't allow public to suspect even possibility of 51% attack. If they do, public will switch to another open blockchain and pool may bleed a little, but miners will go bankrupt
Game theory completely secures Bitcoin. Math is like poetry, really
