If you are creating a cryptocurrency from scratch though, can't you have a protocol in which all the nodes get rid of all the transactions once a year and just give everyone what they already have been verified to have without making it necessary for future nodes to have information about old transactions?  From what I understand Ethereum has "smart contracts."  Can you use those to do this?
I feel that if Bitcoin really caught on to the level of use of a credit card,  downloading the entire ledger would be nearly impossible for the overwhelming majority of people and they'd have to resort to exchanges.

So, is a wallet the same thing as a light weight node or do you need at least a lightweight node to store a wallet?
From what I understand a full node takes up 200 GB because it keeps track of every transaction ever and a lightweight node only needs enough transaction history for your coins so it is a bit smaller? It seems like this would be a lot messier the more popular it gets and more necessary to use a bank or exchange to store bitcoin.
Is it absolutely necessary for a crypto currency to store every transaction on the ledger?  Can the protocol allow for the culling of transaction history after a year?
