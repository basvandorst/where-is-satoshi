Does the difficulty lie in selling the bitcoins for USD on MtGox, or in extracting the USD from MtGox back into one's bank account?  If the latter, seems like the opportunity still exists, the profits would still be made, it'd just take a bit of time to access them.
I was going to attempt this scheme myself with $50 worth of bitcoin just to satisfy my curiosity, but unfortunately not already having a bitstamp account means I'd have to wait at least several business days for my identity to be verified, and they've got a minimum deposit fee of $15, so it wouldn't be worth such a small investment. :(  Ah well!

Is it a currency or an investment vehicle?

First plot is log/log, second plot is log/linear, why?

It really can't be both.  The volatility inherent in an investment vehicle subject to speculative price bubbles and shocks is unsuitable for a currency.
Say you got a new job in late November, early December this year, and your salary was denominated in BTC, back when they were selling for $1200 a pop.  You've taken a 38% pay cut just in the past 2-3 weeks due to nothing but the vicissitudes of the market.
If Bitcoin's going to work as a primary currency--as the thing that salaries and prices are denominated in, that people take salaries in and give loans in--it needs stability, and it won't have stability until the investors either leave the market or are such a small part of it that they're drowned out by "legitimate" uses as currency.
