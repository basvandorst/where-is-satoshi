This.  Excellent comment.

By my read, the commenter understands that.  He's just satirizing one of the points the FUDsters try to make regularly -- that "fee pressure due to limited blockspace wi destroy the utility of bitcoin!". When in reality, $0.25 in tx fees on a car purchase is ridiculously affordable.

Pics or it didn't happen.

While *doing nothing* about his contribution to tx volume as pointed out in the article.

I'm not sure exactly what BitPays plans are, but let's not confuse the difference between two alternative *implementations* of the bitcoin protocol, and two alternative *definitions/versions* of the bitcoin protocol.
The former involve a fork in the git sense, the latter necrssarily involves a hard-fork in the bitcoin network sense.
So far, I have not seen anything from the moderation of this forum that suggests they would attempt to limit discussion about alternative implementations of the protocol.

I think OP realizes this.  The point is that period of time during which charge backs are possible within bitcoin is substantially less than it is for credit card payments.

Yeah, I suppose I should've clicked the link before commenting...  :-)  Heh, my bad.

All-time high

And what fee (in Btc/kb) did you pay on them?  Or better, care to link to the specific txs that were stuck?
@_date: 2016-02-11 17:51:33
No, from a UX perspective I have had no bad experiences due to this.  Have you?
@_date: 2016-02-11 17:06:37
Transaction fees will rise OR confirmations will take longer (or a balance of both effects).  But there won't be txs with $5 fees that never confirm.
More importantly, for any of that to be considered a true problem we have to understand exactly who is affected and why its a problem for them.  Who is it that is critical to the bitcoin economy that can't afford doubling or tripling the current fees?
Last, if value 'overflows' it means that bitcoin is still valuable.  So even in the worst worst case where this starts happening simply because its too expensive to transact in bitcoin, there will be time to respond.
There is no genuine urgency.  Only the urgency behind "if we don't fool people with this line of reasoning now, it will become harder to do so later as they come to realize that the reasoning is/was flawed".

Sounds great, but I haven't seen anyone explain how or why it becomes a problem.  What exactly happens when the blocks are full?  What fails in a sufficiently 'drastic way so as to warrant urgent action?
@_date: 2016-02-11 17:23:25
Move then.  Create the signal so that bitcoin can (if necessary) respond.  Comments like this are otherwise just noise/FUD.
And if you're *not* willing to move, consider that it likely means you still have reasonable confidence in bitcoin over other altcoins despite its "restricted" tx capacity.

I would prefer comments in this sub from people capable of writing something more sophisticated than vague complaints.

What is this line of reasoning?  An appeal to "journalism is really hard and if you're so smart why don't you do it"?
Why don't you stay on topic.  Do you have any evidence to support GA's claim that " truth is stranger than fiction" in this case?
@_date: 2016-07-29 08:29:46
No, it's still a honey badger.
