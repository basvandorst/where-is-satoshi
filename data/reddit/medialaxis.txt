Banks do not lend out savers deposits. When someone takes out a loan of say £200k the create a deposit of £200k out of thin air. Don't take my word for it, get it from the horse's mouth[1]. It's pretty much the same in all other countries. Deposits do not create loans, it's loans that create deposits.

One way is to remember a 24 character phrase and to use it to jumble up the 24 words, which you then write down and keep in as many places as you like. You can unjumble the words, back to the correct order, so long as you remember the phrase and have a copy of the jumbled words.
Some more detail:
(1) Simple map the chars \[a..x\] to \[0..23\] and \[y,z\] to \[0,1\]
(2) The indexes are generated from the phrase char by char starting at the first.
(3) If an index has already been used then use the next unused.
(4) Write the ith seed word at the ith position in a grid/row.

Use a multi-sig address. The delivery firm acts as escrow agent. You sign, (with private key)  when they deliver the goods, to release payment to the vendor. You get your btc back if no deliver (after some time, or whatever).

Try it and see. That is, rename default\_wallet (or whatever)  to something else. Then create a new wallet with the 12 word seed. You'll be asked to set a password (which can be anything you like. It doesn't have to be the original). Electrum should then create a wallet with the same bitcoin addresses, and so the same bitcoin, as the original.  It's useful to do this anyway, just like it's useful to practice restoring stuff on your laptop (or whatever), in case you need to do it for real.

I reckon 0% inflation/deflation is best. You need to think things all the way through though, to see the fallacy in the arguments advanced by both sides. There are too many to go through, but here's just one:
Alice and Bob each own a 4 year old fridges, a new one costs £100 and in inflation is 5%. Alice buys one now for £100. Bob waits a year to buy one at £105. According to the inflationists, Alice has saved herself £5, but that's rather a sort sighted view. Alice's fridge costs her £100/4 = £25 per year while Bob's costs him £105/5 = £21 per year. 
Besides the fact that encouraging people to buy stuff just so others can have jobs making stuff people don't actually need isn't exactly a bright idea., if you think about it. Instead every one could work fewer hours just doing what needs to be done. That way every one's got a useful job plus plenty of time to go and do what ever they like. Work to live - not live to work.

Good to see someone who thinks for themselves and so works out that deflation is natural, not inflation, based on the fact we get better at producing stuff as time passes. Isn't that why it's called Economics? That is, as time passes it takes less effort to produce the same = we do it more economically.
But I don't agree that we're being robbed of twice as much, as wages tend to rise in line with inflation. In normal times with, say, 2% inflation it's our savings that are being eroded. Well, unless you can get 2% or more interest.
So don't hodl fiat, hodl assets such as land, gold or bitcoin.

The other side of the coin is, once you've saved enough to put down a deposit on a house inflation's on your side as the debt (in real terms) reduces with time. Whether that's good or bad (for the economy) is another matter.
@_date: 2017-02-26 21:10:13
Yes, the bank adjusts its rate to cater for inflation but the principal stays the same (less repayments) while the value of your house increases (likely at at least the rate of inflation).  
Example: 25 year mortgage on house costing £100k (hope this comes out okay)
Inflation = 0%, Interest = 5%, Repay = £175k, House now worth £100k.
Inflation = 5%, Interest = 10%, Repay = £273k, House now worth £338k
I used an online mortgage calculator[1] to find the Repay figures. 
I multiplied £100k by (1.05)^25 = £100k * 3.386 to get value after 25yrs at 5% inflation. 
I'm assuming wages keep up with inflation (likely lag a bit behind).
Hope my figures are correct, please let me know if you disagree.

Yes. I used to do some work for a German company, they paid me in euros and the banks helped themselves to a nice slice of my money (while claiming there were no charges!). But AISI that is going to change via FinTech + PSD2 etc. It's no good us sticking our heads in the sand, that'll get us nowhere.  I don't think bitcoin itself cares. I expect it to survive, even flourish, but maybe not in the way we think it will. It is good technology, that's why I believe it will survive and, eventually, finance/banking will run on top of it. Whether people will be aware of it is another matter, IMO. 
@_date: 2017-03-28 17:20:19

Okay, things are not so good in the US and, TBH, I don't know if the transfer of large sums is cheap here in the UK (according to the link I posted small ones are) but I think they will in the future. As I see it, here in the UK and the EU,  the rules are being changed so as FinTech firms can access user bank accounts to provide better services than banks. The idea being it'll drive down fees. If a FinTech firm's app lets you transfer £10 for the same fee as £10,000 won't itl force other firms to do the same, or lose market share? Well' it might not depending whether people want to transfer large sums often or mot, I suppose.
@_date: 2017-03-28 15:35:25
FinTech is providing good, and cheap, mobile banking now, in the UK at least, and the EU has issued its Payment Service Directive2 (PSD2), aimed at encouraging 3rd parties to provide services on top of standard bank accounts. Seems to me most people, in the west, will be happy with that, especially as it's what they are familiar with. Why would they take up bitcoin? What are its advantages? 
One I can think of is it doesn't suffer from inflation. But I think that will mean people use bitcoin as a store of value. If so, they'll not be keen to store large amounts on their mobiles but will want a safe place to store it, you know, like a bank! Thoughts?

Yes, bitcoin is history in the making, don't miss it. I'm so glad to have lived to see its invention (and to 'get it', which we baby boomers aren't supposed to be able to, so I'm told)
But let's not forget that it's just technology and, like all technology, is neither good nor bad in and of itself. It can be used for both.  For example, the Gutenberg printing press was new tech and helped spread knowledge to the masses but could, and did, help spread propaganda too. Having said that, bitcoin certainly has sparked massive enthusiasm that has led to loads of innovation and learning (evolutionary innovation is best, imo).  The amazing thing, or maybe not, is how mainstream media hasn't a clue! It's all going on under the radar. Perhaps that's a good thing.

Bitcoin disintermediates central banks (it's a sort of settlement layer\[1\]) but not banks\[2\]. I'm not sure how binks will work?

It can't really happen in regulated spaces - incest doesn't work too well.

I bought my bitcoin in 2014 using an electrum wallet. Recently blockchair showed each address held coins on all three block chains, btc, bch and bsv (maybe coins on other chains too). Using a more up to date version of electrum (3.3.6) I created a new wallet (segwit) and moved the btc to addresses in it. After that move, blockchair showed coins in the old adresses on the bch and bsv chains only, the old btc addresses were empty, as I expected. I then downloaded and installed Electron-Cash-4.0.10 and created an Electron wallet using the 12 word seed form the original (2014) electrum wallet. The wallet showed the bcash coins, as expected. I then created a new Electron wallet and moved the bcash to an address in that wallet. After the move, blockchair shows coins in the old addresses on the bsv chain only. I haven't done any thing about recovering them yet as I haven't found a wallet that operates on the bsv chain (when I do I guess I'll just repeat, more or less, what I did to recover the bch using Electron-Cash-4.0.10).
@_date: 2019-11-06 08:25:00
I don't know of specific cases where block chain would be a better solution than what we have now (centralised) but am, like you, interested in examples  (there are plenty of projects, both permissioned and private, claiming they use a block chain but they don't give details. Just do a lot of hand waving).
However, isn't Ethereum a better place to look? After all, bitcoin has a restricted language (not Turing complete, AIUI) while Ethereum's language (Solidity, I think) is the logical extension of bitcoin to a full blown Turing complete language. 
But keeping things simple, a Land Register is one suggestion for block chain use. It'd remove the need for a trusted 3rd party when a house is sold. You'd do some sort of cross chain atomic swap. One chain is bitcoin the other house\_coin? No idea how the house\_coin chain would work, perhaps it'd be permissioned. Of course houses are just one form of asset so this idea, if it works, could be applied to any assets that sit on a register.

You're right. Bitcoin is too slow for retail trade, such as buying cups of coffee etc, and likely always will be. Most the guys in this space know that and see bitcoin more as a settlement layer on top of which payment systems can be built by anyone who cares to, no need to ask permission, one example being the Lightning Network.
Now as we know, bitcoin's ledger comes to consensus about every 10 mins (or every hour , if you want less risk) and does so 24/7/365. Whereas private banks settle, through the central bank, every 24 hours and only do so for the 5 business days of the week but not on bank holidays (whatever they are). I think that's the comparison you should be making.

Tragedy of the Commons has been solved time and again by people who graze cattle or sheep on common land, fishermen who fish in common waters and a myriad of other cases. They didn't need a blockchain to do it. ToC is based on the Prisoner's Dilemma, in which the prisoners (shepherds) cannot communicate. Given that premise it is correct (the prisoners grass on each other/ each shepherd shoves a few extra sheep on the common and thus it's overgrazed to oblivion). It totally ignores the fact that the shepherds all drink in the same pub, know they are all prone to shoving a few extra sheep on the common if they can get away with it, know that doing so is bad for them all, and so work out a set of rules to prevent it happening. The rules are  crafted such that the shepherds can spend their nights in the warm pub and not out on the common in freezing  rain spying on each other (although the rules don't bar a shepherd form visiting the common, maybe wearing wellies,  to comfort his favourite ewe, if he so desires). Lin Ostrom[1] was the lady who debunked Garrett Hardin's claim/thesis that such commons would fail unless they were chopped up into private lots or policed by an authority or state.
Having said that, the way bitcoin miners' self interest is levered to ensure we get a ledger we can trust, because it's trustless, is sheer genius, alchemy. And will no doubt be useful if solving problems involving common resources on a global scale.

AIUI, the seed is enough to regenerate a wallet. It follows that two wallets generated from the same seed are effectively the same wallet, only in different places at the same time (sort of entangled). Given both wallets sync with the same ledger (bitcoin's block chain) it follows they will show the same balances, addresses, history etc.

After further thinking. If there's say 100 miners in a pool then the nonce is split into 100 ranges which are issued to the miners. The ranges differ in size and are in the same proportions as the success rates of the 100 miners, IYSWIM. So those that mine no blocks will eventually have a zero range! 
Also, miners are charged a rent, which is distributed amongst them in the same proportion as their success. That means those that mine no blocks will lose coins. Though I'm not sure  if that won't drive out weak miners, those with little hash power. Needs more thought.
But I guess mining pools have already worked all this out?

I've been thinking, on and off, about a peer to peer mobile network (or mesh?). A call from Alice to Bob would go direct if close enough and would cost nowt. If further apart, the call would need to hop through other mobiles and they would be paid for relaying data on.  I expect data would be encrypted. I imagined payment might be using a token native to the network but not sure how that'd (I'm not into that tech, yet) or if something like LN might be better.
Anyway, I'm pretty sure we'll see this sort of thing happen some time in the future and it is the sort of thing that gives bitcoin value (and LN?). I remember reading in the early days something along the lines, "TCP/IP is a thin protocol layer and value accrues to the applications build on top of it whereas bitcoin is a fat protocol layer and value accrues to the protocol layer".

Here's an (obvious?) idea based on mobile phones:
Suppose we had a peer-to-peer mobile phone network. Phones withing range connecting directly, so not cost to anyone other than the two connected. Phones not in range hop through other phones and so pay a fee to those intermediate phones. 
Long distance calls would cost quite a bit, and may be unreliable, due to the number of phones hopped through. But then anyone could set up a phone and connect it to a mast to relay calls to more distant masts and charge a fee for doing so. 
Seems to me it'd be self financing. An open market for anyone, or any firm, to join to provide services they think users would be willing to pay for. 
Similar sort of idea ought work for a decentralised web, shouldn't it?

Yes, I think that's a legit way of viewing bitcoin. But it is a very reliable third party, one whose actions are motivated by its own self interest and those actions align with the interests of the other two parties. 
Banks should also be, and to some extent are, motivated to act in a manner that aligns with their customers' interests but I think the fact there are so few of them it becomes something of a cartel. The "fact" they are now seen as TBTF makes things worse and is driving the search for something better, which doesn't take much effort, when you think about it.

@_date: 2016-06-01 18:14:50
Yet more thoughts (I'll go after this, to research what the pools do in practice).
Say we have 5 miners, A,B,C,D and E. They mine M blocks a day (or whatever). They each pay a fee of f coins a day (total fee F = 5f). The fee, F, is split between the miners in proportion to the coins they mine.
A mines M/2 coins  :  earns = M/2 + F/2 - f = M/2 + 3f/2
B mines M/4 coins  :  earns = M/4 + F/4 - f = M/4 + f/4
C mines M/8 coins :   earns = M/8 + F/8 - f = M/8 - 3f/8
D mines M/8 coins  :  earns = M/8 + F/8 - f = M/8 - 3f/8
E mines 0     coins  :  earns =                 - f =          -f 
To keep C in the pool requires M/8 - 3f/8 &gt; 0 &lt;=&gt; f &lt; M/3.
But if E drops out then F = 4f and then require f &lt; M/4 to keep C in the pool.
But then again, is the fee necessary? I mean, if E isn't given any work to do isn't the attack thwarted?

I was thinking about pools too. I was trying to think how they would work. One way is for each member to start hashing the block from a given nonce (so they don't repeat each other's work), but then I thought exactly what you said, others could join the pool with a dead miner. I cannot see how pools can defend against that? Well, not if pool members are anonymous. Hmm, interesting.

If someone wants to pay a firm, let's call it a bank, to look after their bitcoin that's up to them, right? It doesn't follow that they need to make payments through that bank - as bitcoin is digital cash, right.

The intermediate phones, that relay the call on, get paid a fee. Guess I'll have to learn more about Lightening before I can answer that myself but just like to know what others think. Anyone?

I'm sympathetic to this view. Bitcoin's modeled on Gold, only with finite supply. I think there could be problems with that if it's hoarded, for instance, which is a form of centralisation. How do you defend against it?
 An alternative form of money  is shell money. It's decentralised, anyone can create it and includes proof of work\[1\]. Peopled would only create shell money if it paid better than other work they could do. It's a sort of subsistence money? It seems far less risky than digging for gold. Did anyone every become super rich by producing shell money? Some did by mining gold. Anyway, I don't know how shell money could be modeled with maths and stuff, especially the part where some shells are lost over time (which no doubt happens with real shell money). Any ideas?
\[1\] You can't just scoop shells of a beach, walk to the nearest bar, slap them on the counter and demand a pint of ale. No. The shells have to be a certain type and size. They have to have no flaws and to show that you need to polish each one. You likely have to drill a hole in each so as they can be strung on a necklace or waist band. That takes time and effort = PoW.

Tragedy of the Commons?
@_date: 2019-11-02 20:08:53
AIUI, the repo market used to run before 2008. Banks that didn't hold enough reserves (at the end of the day) would borrow from other banks, against an asset,  overnight. They'd buy back the asset the next day at a slightly higher price, that is they paid interest. Banks would only go to the FED for the overnight loan if no bank would lend to it (hence the FED is known as the lender of last resort). That rarely happened. But that all stopped in 2008 as banks didn't trust each other (who would) and QE began, which pumped banks full of reserves and so the repo market was no longer needed (it was suspended, I think).  
The question is, why have they restarted repo? One conjecture is that some bank is in trouble and none of the others will lend to it, so the FED's had to step in. If that's the case, which bank is it?
Anyway, that's what I've heard. Corrections welcome.

Please you guys, educate yourself as to how banks work. Banks do not lend out your deposits. I'll say it again, banks do not lend out your deposits.  When banks make loans they conjure the money out of thin air. As the loan is repaid they conjure it back into thin air. But don't take my word for it, get it from the horse's mouth [2]. I don't know if the Fed's issued a similar paper but it's pretty much the same in all major economies. Here's a ref for the USA[2]. So it's not "deposits create loans", it's "loans create deposits".

Yes, bitcoin is much like physical cash only cleverer. With physical cash you can stuff it under the mattress, buy yourself a safe or give it to a third party (that has better security than any individual can sensibly afford) to look after for you and for which you pay a fee. With digital cash (such as bitcoin) you can store it on an offline computer stuffed under your mattress or in a safe or give your bitcoin to a third party to look after and pay them a fee. I imagine third parties will come up with various models, such as them having full control, only partial control with you both having to sign txs or cleverer stuff we cannot yet imagine. But there'll be no central bitcoin bank, only the decentral bitcoin bank (the blockchain + network of miners and nodes).

Regards HW wallet vs software wallet (or whatever the term is). You can use a pi zero (the old model without wi-fi) to hold your cold wallet (I use electrum 3.3.6). It costs less than £4 but you also need an SD card (plus monitor and keyboard, unless you use the one used for your pi hot wallet). So cost is minimal. You can use pi zero with wi-fi for the watch (hot) wallet. If it gets infested with viruses you can simple overwrite the SD card with a fresh OS + wallet. Personally I prefer it over HW wallet, in part because I have a good idea what's going on. Tried a Ledger but had to connect to some sort of Chrome UI (how do I know that's not got a virus?) but it's not supported for raspberry pi  (or at least it wasn't).

You can store bitcoin 100% safe by moving them to an address to which no one has the private keys. You cannot get storage more secure than that, right?
Of course, that means you don't have access to the bitcoin either, which is a bit of a bummer. But the point is, if you want storage less secure than that, storage than enables access, then there is no best method. It's a bit like asking which is the least interesting +ve integer.

Yes, we're going to have to have bitcoin banks (binks?) before we get mass adoption. Most people won't want to faff around with hardware wallets nor 12 or 24 word seeds. They have lives to live. The idea that every one will store all their money, their life savings, in their house is ludicrous. 
Banks per se are not the problem. In the past people stored their gold with the local gold smith as he had a secure vault, It was the sensible thing to do. You paid a fee for that secure storage naturally. Problems arose with that system when the gold smith started issuing bills  (receipts for your gold) and people started trading those bills as if they were the gold. The gold smith also loaned out some gold (with interest) but soon found he could lend out bills. As we know, he eventually ended up lending out more gold, in the form of bills, than he had in his vaults. That's the problem - lending out more than what you've got, thus risking a run on the bank.
So the question is, can we use bitcoin to control what bitcoin banks do with the bitcoin we deposit with them? Multi-sig comes to mind but I don't know how to use it to really solve the problem.

Most of them will want something like a bank to help secure their bitcoin and will be willing to pay for such a service, imo. Such bitcoin banks need not be like fiat banks. For a start they cannot conjure bitcoin out of thin air (like they can with fiat). And we can argue as to whether bitcoin banks, which'll give you some sort of card with pin number etc, are any more secure than DIY but that's irrelevant. What matters is what people want, what makes them feel more secure, and people tend to feel most secure with what they're used to - not change, that's scary.

Agreed. But it sustains the economy. Why would you want growth? Well, if the population's increasing, I suppose, but growth for growth's sake? I think we're learning that's not such a good idea. 
Also, deflation and a falling GDP are signs of a healthy economy. Why? Because we get more efficient at producing the stuff we need as time passes. Thus we produce the same amount of stuff in fewer hours. It follows (if we keep the hourly rate the same) that wages fall along with prices (in the same proportion) - so we can buy the same amount of stuff as before. Thus deflation and falling GDP. QED.

What I've done, since my last post.
I'd already moved bitcoin from my old electrum wallet to a new one. That left bcash and SV in the old addresses. I downloaded and installed Electron wallet (on a totally separate  rapsberry pi SD), ran it and gave it the master public key from the old electrum wallet. The Electron wallet then informed me it was watch only. It showed the bcash coins in the old addresses, as I expected them to be.  It advised I convert to and use the new bcash address format, which I'll do later. 
The next step, I reckon, is to create a new Electron wallet and move all the bcash coins to it. Job done, and pretty easy it was (or will be, I hope) too.
Not sure if it's worth recovering the BSV or other coins. May have a go later. Going out for a run, first.

I imagine what is envisioned is a system through which central banks, and maybe some privileged private banks, settle with each other. It's not going to be a base layer that anyone can build on. It'll be the same old permissioned system along with all the AML, KYC etc.  The chances are it won't get of the ground as they'll be unable to agree as to whether payments can be made to the likes of Iran. At best they are likely to end up with more than one global monetary system which, of course, is the exact opposite to what they want!

The problem with building charge back and such into a currency is that you cannot not have it. You've got it even when buying a pint or a coffee, besides vendors not knowing when the money is actually theirs. Also, if txs can be undone then you don't have control of the money - so it's not your money .
Bitcoin is true digital cash so, like physical cash, you stick to the maxim, "don't let go of both ends at the same time". Physical cash worked pretty well, even for sales through the post (Cash on Delivery was one option). But bitcoin is programmable and methods will be developed that enable txs, over the net and phone to phone,  to be made safely. Thus we get (and likely pay for)  charge back when we want it - not when we don't want it.

And then there was a scare about the software being compromised, or something. So it's now at the back of a drawer somewhere.  Too complicated, imo. If you don't understand fully the system you're using to secure your bitcoin then it can hardly be called secure at all.

This would be easy to do if instead of a hardware wallet you had two computers with wallets\[1\], one cold (offline computer\[2\]) the other hot (online computer). You'd just create a new cold wallet, send your bitcoin to an address in it and replace the master public key in the hot wallet with the one in the new cold wallet. Then scratch the old cold wallet together with its seed and keep the new cold wallet's seed, of course.
BTW, that's OTTOMH so anyone following it had better check it's correct first.

This is interesting. I mean, when is the estate tax calculated? Is it at today's bitcoin price? The date on which Dave Kleiman died? Or the day CW gives the bitcoin to Kleiman? If the bitcoin move then its price will likely plummet and so if the tax is calculated at the time of the move it could be a lot lower than today. Perhaps the tax ought be paid in bitcoin? That way the IR would need to sell them off slowly to ensure they get the best price?

AISI, bitcoin is its own central bank and payment system. It's monetary policy is publicly known. I don't see it replacing central banks that issue fiat but think it will help curb inflation (of fiat). As for tx speed, bitcoin is far faster than fiat central banks. It settles about every 10 mins while the central banks do so every 24 hours \[1\] . We could well end up with a second layer on which bitcoin banks run (similar to current fiat system) but you also be able to store your own bitcoin at home, much like in the days when the only money was cash or gold coins. 
\[1\]  I think CBs are working on speeding their systems up. Which is another benefit (on top of curbing inflation) of having competing money systems.

Not a reply, just a thought.
It'd be nice to have a simple piece of code (written by some one other than your wallet provider) you could give a signed tx to and it'd say exactly what the tx was doing (what amounts are being sent to what addresses). You could run it on an independent air capped computer (pi zero) and so be very sure it wasn't colluding with your wallet software. 
Might do it myself if I get time and can understand aantonop's book (but I'm guessing signed txs are more complicated than I think?)

If you want to split them up (including any BSV) the following may help.
I bought my bitcoin in 2014 using an electrum wallet. Recently blockchair showed each address held coins on all three block chains, btc, bch and bsv (maybe coins on other chains too). Using a more up to date version of electrum (3.3.6) I created a new wallet (segwit) and moved the btc to addresses in it. After that move, blockchair showed coins in the old adresses on the bch and bsv chains only, the old btc addresses were empty, as I expected. I then downloaded and installed Electron-Cash-4.0.10 and created an Electron wallet using the 12 word seed form the original (2014) electrum wallet. The wallet showed the bcash coins, as expected. I then created a new Electron wallet and moved the bcash to an address in that wallet. After the move,  blockchair shows coins in the old addresses on the bsv chain only. I haven't done any thing about recovering them yet as I haven't found a wallet that operates on the bsv chain (when I do I guess I'll just repeat, more or less, what I did to recover the bch using Electron-Cash-4.0.10).
The nice thing about this, besides learning new stuff, is if I sell the bch and bsv it should cover the cost of buying the original btc .

I think the lack of support was for the pi (my memory's not too good, age you know). I have a PC running linux but am unsure of the desktop app Ledger provide. Why is it any more secure than my pi set up? I feel I know what my pi is doing. I can check the tx being signed by my cold wallet is sending coins to the addresses I intend them to go - that seems pretty secure to me. 
I think you're right, I could use a HW with the pi, but I'm happy with just the pi, in part because I'm very frugal. The OP's link mentions, I think, some wallets that might enable me to move the bcash and maybe SV. I need to reread it. Thanks for your comments.

Here's a simple/toy model:
Imagine a fixed money supply that consists of 100 tokens each worth £1. Mr Dick buys 10 of these tokens and hoards them until the price of a token rises to £10/9. He then sells all his tokens to make a profit p = 10(£10/9) - £10 = £10/9. After which, eventually, the price of a token reverts to £1.
So, AISI, My Dick has used (manipulated) the token to make a profit of just over 10%, but he's not changed the price of the token permanently, the market decides that.
But what does all this mean?  Who was the profit sucked out of?
Also, if the value of the token is increasing with time (relative to £) Mr Dick's profit will be less, might even be better off not selling his tokens! If that happens then Mr Dick needs to ensure he doesn't diminish the value of the token as he'd be diminish his wealth at the same time. Well, unless he sells out to some other currency before anyone catches on , but then who'd trust any currency he had a stake in? Hmm, gets complicated, doesn't it!
@_date: 2019-10-01 08:28:08
Sorry, I don't follow. Isn't it possible (theoretically) for there to be no fullnodes other than miners? 
AISI, hashing's needed to decide who gets to add the next block. It's possible the miner that mines the next block puts a double spend in it. But that block will be rejected by the other miners. So, it's miners checking the block is valid that stops double spends, not hashing. (It might not be sensible to hash an invalid block but that's beside the point).

I'd like to see a peer to peer (decentralised)  mobile mesh network. Calls are direct if the phones are close enough (no fees to pay) other wise calls hop through other phones that relay on for a fee. Might need to go online if the call is long distance but that can be done by going online via someone's home wi-fi (which is likely doing nowt most of the day)  for a fee. Anyone can join the net work,  you just need to generate a number (not sure how to do that?), including commercial service providers. I expect calls to be end to end encrypted and you'd likely not accept calls from strangers but there'd be no, or little spam anyway, as it'd cost too much.

Yes, inflation benefits borrowers while punishing savers - deflation punishes borrowers while benefiting saves. So 0% de(in)flation , on average, would seem fair (and make the maths  simpler plus saving time wasted having wage revues and other stuff). 
However, as I've said, deflation and a falling GDP is natural in a healthy economy. That means long term debt would get harder to pay off as time goes by, right? Well, only if your wage drops with deflation but I think wages increase with your age (even inflation adjusted) so may well say fixed in a deflationary economy. OTOH, if wages don't stay fixed, or fall,  with age then you just have to save for a bigger deposit, and that's easier in a deflationary economy, AIUI.  In other words, you adapt you behaviour to a deflationary economy.

"One of the purposes of (controlled) inflation is to get people spending and stimulating the economy right now, since the money will be less worth further down the line. "
That is the typical mantra spewed out by those who are too lazy to think things through.  What's so good about a currency that encourages people to buy stuff they don't actually need?  The stock reply to that is that it creates jobs.  Well even if it does, what's so good about creating jobs for people to make stuff that other people don't actually need? Why is it better then people buying stuff if and when they need it? 
Also, consider this. Alice and Bob each have a 4 year old fridge which costs (now) £100 and inflation is 5%. Alice decides to buy a new one now while Bob waits to buy one a year later for £105. Who gets the better deal? Well, Alice's fridge costs her £100/4 = £25 per year.  Bob's costs him £105/5 = £21 per year.  In order for Alice to be getting a better deal than Bob inflation would need to be greater than 25%.

Perhaps we don't need to know how may are lost. Perhaps we ought mimic shell money, instead of gold. Shell money is much like bitcoin in that anyone can produce it, no need to ask permission, it requires proof of work\[1\] and some get lost over time but no one knows how many. You'd only turn to producing shell money if it paid better than your normal work, which puts a sort of cap on inflation. If the number of shells in circulation drops enough (through loses or hoarding) then you'd get deflation until producing shells pays better than your day to day work.
I don't know, OTTOMH, how to mimic that in bitcoin but I see no reason why it couldn't be mimicked.  
\[1\] You have to invest time and effort to find shells of a certain type and size with no flaws. To show they have no flaws you have to polish them. Plus you need to drill a hole in each (using a shard of flint in those days) so as they can be strung on a neck lace or waist band.

Seems to me the only real secure way to have money move out of your bank account to some other account is to do it using end to end encryption, much like bitcoin txs. That is, you send a cryptographically signed tx to the bank.  That way you cannot dispute the tx. Likewise, no money can leave your account unless backed by such a signed tx. Of course, if you expose (or get hacked) your private key to anyone then you've likely lost all your money (unless you've set limits on what can be withdrawn etc). Your keys your bank account, not your keys not your bank account.

Bitcoin banks will be needed before mass adoption occurs. Bitcoin disintermediates central banks not private banks nor other entities that help secure people's bitcoin (and charge for doing so).  Most people will not want their life's savings in their house on an air gaped computer or on some sort of hardware wallet, it's way too risky.  Just like in the days of old, when people used gold coins, most stored them with the local goldsmith (who charged a fee) as  that was more secure, and likely cheaper, that securing them at home. You can store yours at home, if you like, only don't make a song and dance about it.

Out of interest, how easy is it to replace the seed on a ledger without losing the bitcoin on it? 
Can you have two wallets (with different seeds) on the same ledger at the same time? If not, you'd have to reset and set up the ledger with a new seed.

I've been thinking about other forms of money. For instance shell money. You'd only spend time and effort producing it if it paid better than your normal job (fishing, maybe). It's similar for gold coins. So yes it fits with the idea of supply and demand (which can vary depending on location. Shell money often had more value away from the coast , apparently). 
If a money (token) costs less than its value then it'd be produced until inflation brought its value down to the cost of production - unless there are laws against production other than by certain people/firms. So it'd be a permissioned system. You have to wonder though, how much it costs to police such a the system? Hmm, is bitcoin a permissioned system! Sure it costs to do the hashing but hashing doesn't stop double spends, it's the other miners refusing the block that does that, isn't it?

I'm interested in recovering some bcash and SV coins from old addresses. I had been hodling bitcoin in an electrum wallet since about 2014 and recently moved them to a segwit address (and now use version 3.3.6 electrum wallet) and feel those bitcoin are now safe. It was pretty easy to do. So now just need to recover the bcash and SV coins.
Starting from the begining, here's the simple way I see to go about recovering your bcash (for instance) while keeping your bitcoin safe:
(1) Move the bitcoin to a new address\[1\]  (as I did above with electrum)
(2) Move the bcash to an up to date bcash address.
(3) Use a bcash wallet to manage you bcash coins.
I'm a bit stuck now as I don't know how to do (2). You cannot use Electron as it's a scam, so I'm told.
Also (3), I don't know of a bcash wallet, let alone one I can trust.
Looked at your link but it didn't seem to help with either (2) or (3).

One problem I've not seen addressed is, "How can you be sure the vendor will deliver the goods?".

Storing the jumbled seed on the blockchain ensures it's always available where ever you are and so long as you have access to the blockchain (but if you don't then you likely cannot spend you bitcoin either). So, as you say, it comes down to how the seed is jumbled. 
Somewhat going off at a tangent: What is the most secure way to store your seed (or anything at all)? I don't think there's a simple answer to that, if there is an answer at all. I mean, if you stored your seed on paper (or whatever) in an impregnable safe to which you had the only key (if more than one key existed it'd be less secure, wouldn't it?) how safe is that? Thing is, where are you going to store the key to the safe? And what if you lose it?

I think some banks will become bitcoin banks (maybe both bitcoin and fiat) as most people will not be willing to have large sums of bitcoin sat on a computer or hard ware wallet in their house, much like they don't want loads cash stuffed under the mattress, or wherever. Not sure what sorts of accounts they'll provide but a simple one would be much like fiat accounts of today, where you had over the bitcoin to the bank and access the account with a pin number etc (just as today). That requires you trust the bank the same as today. Other types of account might involve multisig addresses. They could also act as Lightning Network nodes, I guess.

Nowt wrong in taking his side. In a debate it's a good idea to take the other side's point of view and see if you can argue their case for/with them. If you find you can then you've learned something - that you were wrong (or, more likely, that they have a valid point) - and the nice thing about that is you go away with the prize of new knowledge. The winner wins nothing. As an old bloke with a beard put it yonks ago, "Better refuted than to refute". Another plus of siding with your opponent  is that by showing you're open to truly listening to their argument they will likely be more willing to listen to your's. Win win, or should that be lose lose?
As for Wright, my opinion is Dave Kleiman was Satoshi, I have no idea of Wright's involvement but the recent court battle shows they knew each other.

I tend to agree. I use two raspberry pi, each with electrum (3.3.6, I think). One's the cold wallet (air gapped) the other hot. I erase\[1\] the cold wallet's file after use, so have to reenter the seed each time I use it, but as I rarely access it (I'm a long term hodler) that's not a problem. If I needed to access if on, say, a daily basis I might get a 3rd pi and store a week or months worth of bitcoin on it (keep it cold but not delete the wallet file). Mind you, I'm not sure how that'd work.

IMO, bitcoin's main killer feature is that it's true digital cash. That is, A can send bitcoin to B without A knowing who B is nor B knowing who A is. Neither of them need expose details that enable the other, nor anyone else, to gain access to their bitcoin. This is massive. I don't understand why it's not pushed more. Every time some vendor gets hacked and bank details (card numbers etc) are spilled we ought tweet, or whatever, it couldn't have happened with true digital cash.
It's also a massive saving for vendors as they don't need to go to the expense of securing our bank details - as they don't have them - you cannot get more secure than that. It also brings peace of mind to the vendor's customers. And more, it also reduces the barrier for small vendors who wish to sell on line.

@_date: 2019-12-16 12:04:29
Yes, it's theoretical. It's to help me get into the maths and concepts etc of bitcoin network and such. It's easiest for me to use the idea of rigs but may change to exahash once I'm more familiar (but ought be able to translate between one and the other?)  
My idea for the 50% attack is to start with m rigs, mine until earned enough to buy another rig, add that one and so on, adding rigs until you have 50% (or whatever you want).  The cost of the attack is the cost of the m rigs you start with. Having done a little thinking about things it seems that if the network is only just profitable then adding another rig or two can make it unprofitable. So looks like a self financed 50% attack is not always possible.  So, although theoretical it is of some use, I think. I mean, the network ought run at near cost (low profit) eventually - market forces, yes? Anyway, I'll keep playing with it until I'm bored (or bring the network down ;-)).

I'm in the UK. AIUI, QE here works as follows: They form a company called the Asset Purchase Facility (APF) which creates £375 billion's worth of bonds. The APF asks the Bank of England (BoE) for a loan of £375 billion (reserves). The BoE asks what collateral the APF has and the APF says it has some bonds and that the bonds are backed by the UK treasury. The APF gets the loan. The APF then enters the bond market waving its £375 billion wad while asking if anyone's got government bonds they'd like to sell. Many holders of bonds sell as the the APF pays a good price. This pushes up the price of government bonds and firms that'd normally buy them are pushed out the market and look elsewhere for bonds. I don't think the APF buys non-government bond but the ECB does according to this\[1\], which also says what's supposed to happen (boost the economy, which hasn't happened, of course).  
As to your taxes paying bankers, I don't think so. In fact, with negative rates on excess reserves banks are paying the ECB not the ECB paying them, AIUI.

German banks are to be allowed to sell and custody crypto\[1\] in 2020. I reckon that's just the start, the thin end of the wedge. Other countries will follow. True crypto can't really be centralised, so banks (central and private) cannot issue it. Crypto models gold or even shell money (like to see than done), which clearly isn't issued by a central authority but by anyone who cares to mine it (or comb a beach).  Governments likely already know they will have to do it this way (allow banks to hold crypto) and will permit it so long as they they can apply their AML /CTF regs. I suspect that to put crypto in a bank you'll need to show you bought it legit. Also, if you try to spend a large sum (of crypto you've had stored on a HW or whatever)  to buy a house, say, you'll have to show you got it legit. That's the future of crypto and banking, imo.

"Contrary to what you have heard, commercial banks do not print money. Their primary functions are savings and loans (i.e. moving idle money into the hands of investors)."
If  you think banks take in deposits and loan them out then think again.  It's the other way round. That is, loans create deposits - not deposits create loans. At least that's the cash in the UK\[1\] and Germany (who have issued a similar paper. Sorry I have no link). It's something similar in the other major nations. Thus about 95% of money (actually it's really credit) in the economy is loaned into existence by private banks (they destroy it as it's repaid, of course, bar interest, which is ought be spent into the economy)

You could encrypt your seed using 100% secure method (such as one time pad) and store the encrypted seed on bitcoin's block chain - that's 100% secure (so long as bitcoin exists, if it doesn't then it hardly matters).  
Now, of course, you need to somehow hide the key (one time pad or whatever) you used to encrypt your seed. I suggest you repeat the above (and so end up with the encrypted key stored on the block chain using a second key).
Repeat the above for the second key and all subsequent keys. Once you complete the task your seed will be 100% securely stored, together with all encryption keys, on the block chain.

Deflation won't stop people buying the essentials, obviously. They may well put off buying the non-essentials, stuff they don't actually need but what's wrong with that? Deflation is what should happen in a healthy economy, simply because we find more efficient ways of producing goods and services with time - we get more productive - thus we need work fewer hours to produce the same amount and so, assuming wage rates stay the same, wages and cost of stuff go down with time = deflation. 
Also, putting off buying stuff like clothes, cars, fridges etc until you really need them should increase demand for products that last longer and discourage products that don't last very long. Of course stuff that lasts longer will likely cost more\[1\] so that will counter deflation to some extent but it will likely be better for the environment.

Here's an update, FWIW.
Calculate network's profit, P (per 10  mins):
Assume a block is produced every 10 mins.
b = cost of running a rig for 10min.
f = fee paid per block (including any block reward).
n = number of rigs
We require f &gt; n\*b for the network to be able to make a profit.
So need f/(nb) &gt; 1, the greater it is the greater the network profit.
P = f - n\*b
If you run m of the n rigs then your profit is P(m) = m\*P/n = m\*(f - n\*b)/n
P(m) = m\*(f - n\*b)/n
Time to earn a rig:  (Time is actually 10\*(k + i) mins)
m = number of the n rigs you're running.
r = cost of a rig.
k(m + 0)\*P(m) = r = k0\*m(f - nb)/n
k(m + 0) = r\*n/(f - nb)\*m = time to earn a rig running m rigs out of n
k(m + 1) = r\*(n + 1)/\[(f - b(n + 1)\](m + 1) = time to earn a rig running m + 1 rigs out of n + 1
k(m + i) = r\*(n + i)/\[(f - b(n + i)\](m + i) = time to earn a rig running m + i rigs out of n + i
Note the above requires f &gt; b(n + i) else k(m + i) &lt; 0.
Want m + i = (n + i)/2  (for 50% attack)
\-&gt; 2m + i = n
\-&gt; i = n - 2m
To self finance a 50% attack requires f &gt; 2b(n - m)
Time to self finance 50% attack
Starting with m rigs. Assume m &lt; n/2
K = k(m + 0) + k(m + 1) + ... + k(m + i) + ... + k(n - m)
K = r\*sum\[ (n + i)/\[(f - b(n + i)\](m + i) \] for i in \[0..(n - 2m)\]
K = r\*sum \[(n + i)/(m + i)\]/\[f - b(n + i)\] for i in \[0..(n - 2m)\]
Requires f - b(n + n - 2m) &gt; 0 &lt;-&gt; f &gt; 2b(n - m) where m &lt; n/2
Pretty messy. No idea how to get the sum or approximate it.

Yes, eventually fees would have to be high else miners wouldn't get paid enough. That'd mean bitcoin acts as a settlement layer for any banks wishing to join (bitcoin's an open system, open to all as you know) . It'd be far superior to current systems, which settle once every 24 hours but only if it's a business day (whatever that is).
 But I'm thinking banks could run LN nodes, maybe one LN node per account? Account holders could move btc from their account to a LN node on their phone. Either that or spend direct from the account itself. I prefer the former but don't know enough about Lightning Network to say if either, or neither, is possible. Buy we really need true digital that's fast. I think bitcoin and LN are be able to deliver it, it's just a matter of sorting out the details, imo.

Warren Buffet  believes in investing in assets that produce something of value\[1\]. For instance a farm. A farm produces a crop that you can sell, for a profit, and you still have the asset (the farm). Bitcoin isn't like that. In order to make a profit with bitcoin it has to go up in price and to realise the profit you have to sell the asset (the bitcoin) or, at least, part of it.  A farm may well go on producing a profit year on year but something like bitcoin will eventually reach a stable price, after which it will produce no profit just like other currencies.

In a healthy economy things get cheaper with time because we find more efficient ways of producing goods and services the more we produce them (we find more economical ways of producing them - isn't that why it's called economics?). Thus we need work fewer hours to produce the same amounts, thus (assuming same wage per hr) wages fall in line with prices. Thus deflation is a sign of a healthy economy - inflation's a sign of an unhealthy economy (which is exactly what we have, in case you haven't noticed).

As I and others have said, most people will want some form of custodian to look after their bitcoin. That is, there'll need to be bitcoin banks before there can be mass adoption.  When that happens (and it's happening in Germany, for instance) governments will accept it, as bitcoin will act pretty much like cash, only it'll be digital cash. That means most people will withdraw smallish amounts to their phone (much like we used to do with cash, only it was stored in a physical wallet) which they'll be able to spend anonymously (much like physical cash) in shoops or over the internet. However, large amounts will most likely be spent bank to bank and so can be tracked. Thus banks can comply with AML etc. That's how I see things going in the future.

Isn't what matters, during these times, is that the miners keep mining?
I assume that at the moment each bitcoin is mined at a loss, the energy costs &gt; $3000.
If I were a (rational) miner would I stop mining any bitcoin at all? If all miners did so then bitcoin would be dead, and all I'd have left is a load of ASICs to sell for scrap. 
Alternatively, I could turn off some rigs. That'd reduce my losses and, if other miners turned off some of their rigs, the number of bitcoin produced would reduce, until the difficulty changes. When the difficulty drops I can turn off more rigs (if still making a loss). Thus there will be fewer bitcoins produced per day (average time between blocks &gt; 10min) and the cost of producing each is less (fewer hashes per bitcoin = less energy per bitcoin).
I don't know if miners think that way. If they have faith in bitcoin long term then they may well think along those lines. Of course, they have to have enough $s to pay for the electric or be willing, and able, borrow some (rates are low but rising!).
Anyway, my 2 sats.

If you mean "how much money is unencumbered" then as all (broad) money is loaned into existence when private banks make loans[1][2] none of it is unencumbered (bar about 3% which is notes and coins). For every £1k in credit in a bank account there's £1 in the red in some other bank account. If all debts were repaid the economy would collapse or we'd have massive deflation.
[1] At least that's how it works in the UK, there's no fractional reserve banking here (FRB). I think it's the same in most major countries, that is loans create deposits not deposits create loans (and no one does FRB).

Two good arguments for vendors accepting bitcoin are (1) it saves the vendor money, as they don't need to secure customers' IDs or bank details, beside not having to pay Visa et al a percentage. (2) It protects customers, as the don't have to hand over their bank details or ID. Win Win, as they say.

Did you read the link I posted? In particular in the overview box on the first page it says,
"In the modern economy, most money takes the form of bank deposits. But how those bank deposits are created is often misunderstood: the principal way is through commercial banks making loans. Whenever a bank makes a loan, it simultaneously creates a matching deposit in the borrower’s bank account, thereby creating new money."
To be clear, the last four words are, "thereby creating new money". Here, in the UK, all broad money is created by private banks. Central banks create only narrow money (also known as reserve currency), not broad.

A bit of a nit pick but...
"A Bitcoin economy, for instance, can foster peer to peer lending that substitutes for traditional lending, where banks collect the “interest rate spread,” the difference between the interest rate they charge depositors and the rate they charge borrowers."
...if I'm reading the above correctly, it seems to be saying banks lend out depositors' money to borrowers - that's not what they do. When private banks make loans they create the money out of thin air[1], at least that's how it works in the UK (and likely in most other countries). I'd have thought Forbes would know this!

As other's have said, fiat is Latin, "let it be". Banks conjure dosh out of thin air (let it be) whereas bitcoin requires work. It's got nowt to do with what's backing it up, it's all to do with what it cost to produce it. The up front cost, that keeps it honest. At least that's how I see it.

Assuming they use a decentralised ledger of some sort, what's not clear to me is: presented with two ledgers how is it decided which is the correct one?

AISI, bitcoin disintermediates central banks, they are not needed, but it's up to individuals if they want to pay a 3rd party to secure their bitcoin and there's nothing wrong with that. It's their money and so their choice. I expect most will do that as most people have no wish to learn how they can secure their bitcoin using multisig, air gapped computers and/or hardware wallets etc. Chances are some, if not many , will get hacked. Also, if most use a 3rd party (maybe a bank), it makes those that secure their own more secure (so long as they don't brag about it) - think about it. 
So, we need 3rd party bitcoin banks before this'll all take off, or at least they'd be a great help, so let's start working on ideas for them.

Yes, that's right. So AIUI, in my example, if you bought the bond for $127 (instead of $108) you'd get $0 yield\[1\] while if you paid more that $127 you'd get negative yield.
\[1\] If we assume yield = face value of the bond + total interest you get - what you paid for the bond.

I don't accept Kant's argument. I much prefer Hobbes. He said, more or less, we all agree to abide by a set of rules (such as not stealing from each other) as by doing so we all benefit\[1\]. It's a contract. So if a guy, or group of guys, find they are unable to feed themselves or their family no matter what they do (within the rules) while, at the same time, they see others in another group lording it up, why should they stick to the rules? 
\[1\] Without a set of rules we'd each be sat outside our cave clutching a big club, defending it, until about age 30 when a 19 year old would come along and smash our skull in with his bigger club.

Good question. Haven't the time to think about it just now but will do so next week (as I walk the North Cornish Coast:-)).
But, OTTOMH, for whales to manipulate the price they have to sell, don't they? Also, you're assuming other currencies, the one you're measuring the price of bitcoin in, is a better store of value. That may be true just now but with the likelyhood of more QE that may not always hold. And last, but not least, let's not forget that the idea a decentralised currency, such as bitcoin, could actually come into existence would have been poo hoed before it actually did!

Sounds more or less the same as what I do, bar the regular buying:   I've been hodling a few bitcoin since 2014. Have an old version of Electrum on an old computer (off line) running linux\[1\]. Have a watch only wallet (later Electrum version, 3.3.6 I think) on an online computer so as I can check the bitcoin are still there (paranoia, I know). I don't buy any bitcoin but could if I wanted to, or if anyone wanted to send me some :-).
\[1\] I don't keep this (offline)  wallet live (if that's the right term). Every now and then I restore it from the 12 word seed, check I've done so correctly and then shred and remove the wallet file (more paranoia). The 12 word seed is kept jumbled up with 12 other words, on paper. So I have to un-jumble it every now and then (the paranoia never ends!).

I don't think so. AIUI, this relates to the spike in repo rates (the rate banks charge each other to borrow reserves over night) which shot above the FED base rate  of 1.75% to 10%. The FED stepped in to offer (overnight) loans at base rate. These loans are repaid the following day, adding them all up and claiming the sum total is what the FED injected is somewhat misleading and does your reputation no good. 
Also, before 2008 the FED always offered repo (overnight loans) at base rate thus limiting what other banks could charge (and is the reason the FED's know as the lender of last resort, as are most other CBs). With QE there's been no need for the FED to act as lender of last resort as the banks are stuffed full of reserves. Well, that was the case up to now. What's of interest is why the banks hiked their rates?  If it continues the it's more than a blip and gets even more interesting (the start of QE4?) There are a few theories floating about but I'll nor bore you with the details, you can duckDuckGo the matter and bore yourself.

If I had to bet on who was Satoshi Nakamoto my money would be on Dave Kleiman. I read somewhere that he wrote in C++ and used a Windows machine (later on linux too, I think) but I don't have a reference to hand right now, but have just found this\[1\]. Whether Wright was involved in it I have no idea. Might be useful to compare Kleiman's and Wright's code with Satoshi's but at most that'd only throw light on who wrote the actual code. But then again, Sataoshi said he wrote the code before he wrote the paper, which is totally not the way your'e supposed to do things but, with truly innovative ideas, is often the way it goes - a lot of loosely related ideas are coming together in your head, writing them all down and analysing it to see if it will work will kill it dead, so writing code while the adrenaline flows is what you do.

Yes. I don't think I'm disagreeing with you, too much. I'm just trying to point out that a lower ROI in a deflationary economy is not a problem. In fact it ought be lower (in absolute terms). And in an inflationary economy it ought be higher. In both cases, after you adjust for (in/de)flation, the return ought buy the same amount of stuff.
At least that's how I see it for medium, or ongoing, investment. You know, like running a small or medium sized business. I haven't thought through long term investments (like railways and such) but I guess it's the similar. Will think about it more when I get time (likely this Friday, which is forecast will be sunny and so I'll likely be sat in the beer garden of the Plough supping a pint of Rossie's Pig (cyder))

Haven't read the article (as I'm just on my way out for a pint of Rosie's Pig at the Plough) but reckon we need Bitcoin Banks before we get mass adoption. Bitcoin disintermediates central banks - not private banks, nor others, that help you secure your bitcoin (for a fee). Most people don't know how the current system works let alone bitcoin and don't wish to learn, life is too short. 
BTW, what I'd like to see is some form of decentralised bitcoin bank, in part to avoid surveillance etc. No idea how such would work (perhaps after a few pints of Pig the ideas might flow!).

Bonds pay interest (called the coupon, I think). So if a ten year $100 bond pays a coupon of 3% and you buy it off some guy for $108 after he's held it for a year then you'll get $100 back after 9 years plus 9\*$3 = £27 in interest. A total return of $127 and so profit of $19. Nobody's lost out (other than maybe tax payers who fund all this).
@_date: 2019-09-11 10:34:23


I agree the world is deflationary. But disagree with the above (investors will look for greater ROI), at least the investors that think it through wont. They will realise that in a deflationary economy ROI may be lower (in absolute terms) but it buys more (by the time you get it). It's similar in an inflationary economy, ROI seems greater but (as prices have risen by time you get the return) it buys less.

Yes, that's what I want to know too.  Clearly someone was short of reserves (knowing who seems to be kept under wraps). One thing I've learned, since posting, is that the FED pays interest on excess reserves in cash - not reserves\[1\]. So perhaps banks value cash far more than anything else? So much so that they are unwilling to lend out their reserves (and so forego the interest in cash they'd get) unless they get at least 10% interest from the borrower (which would be paid in reserves not cash). Cash is worth a thousand promises, especially if the market is pumped full of bubbles.

Are the likes of Christine Legarde and Mark Carney\[1\] daft? I suggest they are bright people. They likely believe what they are doing is the best they can do under the circumstances they have to operate.  Yes, they no doubt have their own biases, like we all do, but they can hardly come out and say let's dump the $ as reserve and use bitcoin instead. For all you and I know, they may well think bitcoin, or its ilk, is the future and are laying the ground for that future to materialise (without affecting their pensions in a negative way, of course). Of course they could just be panicking and are hell bent on maintaining control through the current central banking system. Whichever, I think they see the writing on the wall (it's been staring at them for 10 years and won't be going away any time soon).

"These loans are typically rolled over the following day, right?"
No. Perhaps I should have said more about what a repo is.  Briefly, in a repo the bank (which is short of reserves) exchanges collateral for reserves (from a bank or the CB). It's assumed they will reverse the exchange next morning, it does not roll over. It's technically a sale (but with interest!). It's done so that the bank meets its reserve requirements (what ever that is) that night. See \[1\] for more detail.
I agree it seems all smoke and mirrors. I mean, when the bank gets its collateral back the next morning, in exchange for the reserves, it then has less reserves than it did the night before as it has had to pay interest! Seems like it only has to meet the reserve requirements over night, not all day long! It's as if the CB's ledger comes to consensus every 24 hrs as apposed to bitcoin's 10mins!

People are used to having their money looked after by banks. They aren't going to risk large sums of their money being stored on a computer or some sort of fancy hardware device (such as a hard ware wallet) which they have to look after themselves (in their house or where ever).

Perhaps I haven't made myself clear. The security code does not need to be on the card itself. For card present purchases it's not needed. It's only needed for card not present purchases. Thus the security code is kept separate from the card (just as the pin is). For online purchases you type in the security code, as you do now, it doesn't need to be on the card.

An alternative model to gold, that I like, is shell money. Like gold it's decentralised, anyone can produce them, they carry with them proof of work\[1\] and they were used successfully on many continents for hundreds of years. Mind you, I have no idea, off hand, how you'd mimic shell money in software. With actual shell money people would only produce more if it paid better than going fishing (or whatever their normal occupation was). Not sure how/if you can mimic that with bitshells.
\[1\] You couldn't just scoop a hand full of shells off a beach, walk in a bar, slap them down on the counter and expect to be served with a pint of ale, you'd be laughed at. You had to find shells of a certain type with no flaws, that requires polishing them up, to show they are flawless. You'd likely have to drill a hole in each one (using a piece of flint or whatever) so as they could be strung on a necklace or waist belt.

But the central bank has to pay its employees and other expenses which, just like any other firm, it does so with its profits (the interest). So it effectively spends the 3% interest into the economy thus enabling full repayment, in theory. One way to think of it is that the interest is the cost of the CB providing the money and running the banking service. You have made a simple mistake, like many before you, the system can go on indefinitely, sorry.

@_date: 2016-05-17 07:37:04
All I meant by emptying your wallet was to send all the coins to another wallet. The idea being you'll be attempting a double spend and the second one ought go through if you pay a fee (the other won't as the wallet will then be empty). But you say your wallet is empty, which I find odd. Is that according to electrum or have you tried pasting the wallet number in blockchain.info to see what it says?

Yes, nice article but contains a common misunderstanding as to how banks actually work. It says...
"Retail banks are the banks most people have their checkings and savings accounts at. These banks focus on the general public as customers. Currently, these banks make their revenue by loaning out customer deposits for interest and..."
...which is not true. Banks do not lend out customer deposits. When a bank makes a loan it creates the deposit out of thin air (and it destroys the money as it is repaid, bar the interest of course). In other words, it's not deposits create loans, it's loans create deposits.

He'd be correct if bitcoin were just money but it's more than that. It's the fuel that drives the bitcoin network. Bitcoin is a protocol, a fat protocol[1] and as such value accrues more to the protocol layer than to the application layer (it's the other way round for thin protocols such as TCP/IP) thus bitcoin increases in value with increase in applications using the network.
