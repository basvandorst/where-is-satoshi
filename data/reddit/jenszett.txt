Yeah, just like Bitcoin there is a predetermined number of coins. They are indivisible. And you can buy a million IOTAs for about 1.30$ now. The huge number of coins is due to the business case of IoT and microtransactions (hence also why every transaction has zero fees), so machines can send very low amounts of money back and forth, for example to buy the data of a sensor.
The number of coins may seem huge, but when one puts it in comparison with Bitcoin, with its smallest division of 1 Satoshi, then IOTA only has something like 1.7 times as many coins.

In recent news, the user U/wmurray003 was hodl hostage for some obscure cryptocurrency. The robbers did not use a high enough transaction fee though and the transaction never got confirmed.

Do they accept cash? Localbitcoins might help. Though it is probably very difficult to find someone non-shady to exchange a few hundred thousand dollars from bitcoin.

Now what if the customer happens to also work at JPM?

Makes sense. Also a great exit strategy for getting rid of all national debt. Just go all in in cryptocurrencies, until your standard currency is no longer needed and devalues tremendously. Checkm8 central banks. Also Japan could probably be able to sustain itself without the need for new public debt, since taking that in cryptocurrencies can be as big as a problem as owing debt in a foreign currency.

It makes a lot of sense from a remittance payment standpoint. People sending money home from abroad will have less fees to pay to western union and the likes and much more will actually reach the recipient. So yeah, this is a huge deal which will probably increase bitcoin usage a lot.

Kind of funny, coming at a time when the US want to pass a law basically outlawing cryptocurrencies.
