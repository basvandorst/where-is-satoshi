Just tell people the first 10,000 users get some free BTC and everyone will lose their minds over it. Side Note: I like the UI as well.
@_date: 2018-01-03 10:04:13
Yeah, $1,000 is basically pocket change &amp; I'm not even well off.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:09:44
With autopilot!
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:46:50
I'm one of those, but not planning on selling.. Not sure where I was going with this, but yeah
@_date: 2018-01-05 10:38:49
It will go up &amp; down.
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:47:31
I only made $72 working a 7 hour day. So hey, almost more than my "real job" lol
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:50:23
I'm guessing there will be a movie about how some big whale or institution manipulated BTC in about 8-10 years. Hopefully we will all watch and laugh about it in our lambos.
@_date: 2018-01-29 12:53:23
Thank you for not making me waste a click. Lol
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:17:19
I think you spelled "financial situation" wrong. ;)
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:32:56
I mean I can make a good looking website and say I'm insured too, even add a little logo at the bottom to drive it home. But the chances of the big boys being a scam, or the CEO stealing all our BTC? Probably slim.
I trust them enough, but I will be buying a Ledger when they restock in march. I just like having control of my shit. If it's sitting on the exchange, do we really even own it?
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:28:05
I have at least 37.
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:54:24
But I thought he had lots of KNOWLEDGE!
@_date: 2018-01-05 13:08:10
Yeah I figured I'd get burned at the stake if I didn't at least crop out the majority of it haha.
@_date: 2018-01-25 21:14:06
I'm basically a noob as far as investing goes, but even I know to spread it out over several alts, VS just one coin. As far as speculating the price, who knows we'll see.

I'd get some more just in case.
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:36:54
The trend is my only friend..

I'll take it if you don't want it.
@_date: 2018-01-24 09:31:03
I'm pretty sure they mean a direct deposit, like how companies pay employees vs printing them a check.

Yeah chase. I'll have to play around with it later &amp; see what the deal is. Either way it sucks. Just another thing to pay for.

I always see them on eBay and Amazon too and it makes me cringe. Like, why?! I'm pretty much a total noob and I know not to buy from anywhere else. Glad you caught yourself though.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:14:35
I wonder if this applies to crypto product ads as well, ex: A bitcoin book or a button pack, etc.
@_date: 2018-01-07 10:45:57

I don't have hands so it's cool.
@_date: 2018-01-25 03:39:12
Well a few of them have varying amounts anywhere from $0.33 to $0.78 cents. But my big-money / main accounts, I try and keep those above $1.17 at any given time!
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:05:06
I just try and forget I even own bitcoin. Can someone remind me in a couple years?

Same. I got a shitload more points than usual the last handful of months. 
@_date: 2018-01-31 04:41:28
I'm in that same exact boat. (Beginning of November) I try not to worry and check prices all the time. I'm in this for the long run. Just strap in, we'll go on this crazy ride &amp; see what happens.
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:04:16
"Thank you for your initial down payment of 0.2 BTC. Pls make another deposit of 0.2 BTC to regain access to files"
@_date: 2018-01-27 12:03:35
It should. (Worker for the last 3 or 4 months. Over many purchases) But I guess CB changed something about how they process card transactions now. This started yesterday for me at least.
From what I know they are doing "cash advances" and chase is canceling mine for some reason. I'm guessing they think it's fraud.
When I started buying a while back, chase was also blocking my CB purchases at first. I will have to send them an email and see what the deal is. Usually it's pretty simple to fix.
I don't think chase is trying to stop people from buying crypto, I've just never had cash advances done with my card so they probably think it's "unusual activity" and red flag it. I'm pretty confident I can clear this up in a day or two. Should be good after that, aside from paying an extra amount to complete the cash advance or whatever. Someone else said it's another 5%. ��
@_date: 2018-01-26 13:39:30
"Who knows, we'll see."
@_date: 2018-01-07 16:54:26
The disadvantage is at $115 a month, you probably won't want to quit your day job.
@_date: 2018-01-25 06:50:48
That's what I try to do. I check the charts once in a while if I intend to buy more. Just forget it exists for a couple years.
@_date: 2018-01-03 08:26:26
Oh will I..
@_date: 2018-01-30 11:52:09
I knew this was a thing, very interesting to read though. Can we expand on how the rich aren't stupid enough to hold USD? I'm guessing gold or crypto maybe? Someone educate me please.

If you say it 10 times fast it'll become a real thing!
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:37:44
Heard about it 3 to 5 times over the span of 8 years. (Don't remind me, story for another time perhaps) 
Buddy of mine sat me down and hardcore told me we need to buy in when it was at $1000. Kind of blew him off "I don't have a $1000 for one coin" type deal.
Screwed around till a few months later when it was $5 or $6k &amp; kinda sat myself down and decided to really research it and learn about it. Finally started buying in @ $7,200.
Now I'm just doing my thing &amp; hodling in the meantime. I'm strapped in, ready for the ride wherever it takes me.
@_date: 2018-01-31 07:03:18
That's deep!
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:45:44
You're supposed to keep those?? I deleted that months ago
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:22:28
That's cool, but I wasn't about to get into it that much haha,
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:08:45
Nope. Can confirm. Mine just got canceled too. Bank is fucking me around now, they probably think it's fraud again ��
@_date: 2018-01-07 15:07:59
I assume, eventually someone smart will take a bunch of them apart and tinker with  / modify them somehow &amp; resell them. But that's just me, I'm like half paranoid with that kinda stuff. Haha

Welcome to the club.
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:57:20
I feel like a lot of it revolves around simplicity and convenience. I like the ability to pay bills, check accounts, etc using an app &amp; or website. Our credit union is 99% to small to have that, although I haven't looked into it.
I don't live in Switzerland, but here the non-bank atm fees are absurd. (Ex: the atm at the post office or gas station) But there is usually a chase atm in pretty much every city I've been in so i guess I just deal with it. Not sure if the credit union has no or low-fee atms around.
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:43:05

Magic internet money. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:30:02
Coinbase isn't bad if your plan is to buy and hodl for a long time. It's super simple compared to some of the other places. (My mom could figure it out &amp; that's saying a lot)
The fees are high if you want to sell or transfer out I believe. You can use Coinbase's sister company GDax to bypass some of the fees. Other people can explain it better if you care to use them.
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:54:02
We're people able to store their coins elsewhere back then (ex: their own wallets) I always wondered if everyone that used MG got screwed or just people that had their coins still on the website

Probably not worth the effort. Just buy like 0.00001 BTC 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:03:38
Agreed. Just buy him a crypto book or something related, save the real paper wallet for later on and maybe give him some sort of "fake" paper wallet graphic type printout. (So he knows he has the real one being kept safe, but he can have something physical / have it now / something to keep and look forward to getting the real one)
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:29:56

Would also wait till 21 or 25. When i graduated high school at 18, I got stocks &amp; bonds / money my parents saved and put away when I was little. It wasn't much, but I spent it all on the dumbest shit in a few months time. Wish I would of saved it or kept it untouchable for a while longer until I was a little older and more mature.

There are a handful, most likely cheaper yes. I know with Coinbase you're paying extra for simplicity and ease of use.

At least like, 3 to 7 people.
@_date: 2017-12-15 00:23:47
I'm guessing a lot of these people will have some sort of backup plan or will that will enable their estate or family to gain access to their BTC if they die. Especially if it's someone w/ a "big amount" I doubt they would be such assholes to take their bitcoins to the grave.
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:15:25
When my dad saw the price charts, he's like "So when you buy in do they send you a certificate or something like stocks?"
Me: No not really.
Him: So it's not real then..
Me: It's about as real as your PayPal money.
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:43:15

@_date: 2018-09-13 11:25:37
I’m kind of in the same boat. Just don’t go flashing it around and telling everyone you’re the bitcoin millionaire guy. Get a concealed carry license if you really think you’re going to get robbed. Store it all offsite.
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:17:24
I usually look once a day or if I get bored, simply to know if I should buy more lol. I'm not really worried, I came in around the same time with the right mindset.

I guess it comes down to how bad you want a job. I see 3 solutions here:
A. Learn to enjoy walking.
B. Buy a bicycle / pay your friends who drive for rides.
C. Make your own job.
There are many ways to make money, aside from getting "a real job" - Think outside the box a little.

I've never had a problem with them. But I've read other comments on here that said their phone support is much better / faster than their email support. I've never had to use it so I can't really verify.
Pretty sure everyone talked about bitcoin to their families over thanksgiving and millions of new users signed up in the last few weeks. So I'm assuming they have a massive growth issue their dealing with right now. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:02:07
I don't know about laser cutters, but I'm pretty sure standard office printers store records of what was printed. So if someone really smart (IT person, hacker, geek squad, etc) really wanted to, they could technically access all the files that were printed, the dates and times they were printed, what computer it came from and all that. Again, the average person won't know how &amp; I'm not sure if laser cutters do this or not. Just a thought.
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:22:34
I'm sure that has other implications. I don't think you can just go around scamming people. (But what do I know) 
Besides taking a big fat shit on Bitcoin cash's reputation, at what point will your plan start to reflect on / degrade the entire crypto community as a whole. Just something to think about.
Before, I was talking strictly from a intellectual property / trademark point of view. Feel free to ask over on r/legaladvice. They'd be able to answer better than 90% of us over here will.

After reading that, I will never get those precious 2 minutes of my life back.

“Sir.. This is McDonalds. Why are you counting stacks of $100 dollar bills from a briefcase in the corner booth??”
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:08:01
Sadly I also didn't know this for a long time.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:48:13
I bought in (mostly) at $7,300 and I thought that was bad. Figured I'd wait a bit to get more. Then it went up to $10k.
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:51:30
Seems legit. Should I click and give them my private keys too?
@_date: 2017-12-02 15:42:36
I can see it now. "Bitcorn - Kinda like Bitcoin, but for farmers"
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:28:05
I'll send you one.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:43:45
I can see the no car thing, but why are you "not allowed" to get a job? I'm sorry but that's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:19:14
Agreed. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-05 19:13:07
Coinbase does the $10 thing but you can sign up with any email now a days. Not sure if that was them back in the day or not.
@_date: 2018-09-06 16:18:58
Done. Anything else?
@_date: 2018-09-13 06:07:31
Stay in school OP.
@_date: 2017-12-02 10:16:59
Yeah what he said. I've never had a problem either.

Some dude mined 7500 BTC back in the super early days, stopped messing with it, forgot &amp; threw away his hard drive a few years later. So things could always be worse!
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:11:14
Yeah, last night. Not that it matters. Lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:59:11
Random question, but what country are you in? Just curious 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:52:49
I'm basically next to poor. I'm assuming you know, but you don't have to *actually* buy a full bitcoin. You can throw in some pocket change and call it a day if you really wanted.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:52:35
Didn't we say $12,000 by Christmas? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:19:35
He ded..
@_date: 2017-12-10 11:15:46
At least your mom doesn't call it Bitcorn.. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 21:13:59
Kids will be kids either way. If they have an interest in it, cool. If they don't, don't drill it into their heads.
I kinda wish I learned more earlier for the sake of being smart financially &amp; knowing how to save money. But I was too busy playing Pokémon on my game boy. Hah
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:26:23
Off topic, but how's the auto pilot if you have it?
@_date: 2017-12-10 10:30:56
Better question: How much BTC can you earn / get mining for X amount of time?
@_date: 2017-12-07 07:59:21
I don't even see *anything* about bitcoin on my fb. All mine is anymore is people sharing the dumbest shit. I stoped using it quite a bit. It's all just garbage.
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:28:21
I bought a 2nd monitor for this reason. One screen has Reddit. Other screen has GDAX.
@_date: 2018-09-13 12:12:21
I’d say whatever the amount is that A: It’s not awkward to have sprawled out on a table in front of random strangers without thinking you’re going to be robbed at any second. And B: Any amount that can fit into your pockets quickly.
Few thousand maybe? Definitely under $10k for me. Personally I wouldn’t want to sit and count / display it for very long. I guess you could use the good ol “Whatever amount you can afford to lose” saying. That can apply to McDonalds transactions as well. Lol
I’d probably break it up into multiple smaller buys, or just get a concealed carry permit. Or all of the above.
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:32:15
Please use part of that $57 to purchase a dicktionary as well.
@_date: 2018-09-12 09:01:20
Too late.

Good god. This needs to happen now!
@_date: 2018-09-13 11:08:50
You’re like the bitcoin pizza guy, except different. Maybe you were the first one to trade BTC at McDonald’s.
@_date: 2017-12-14 15:27:27
That's what she said.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:17:14
Agreed. Do they have AA for bitcoin yet? Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:08:56
The least amount possible. Not sure how much we're talking here. If the only thing you need is a computer, I do have a fairly decent one, not some cheap on sale Walmart one either. Haha
@_date: 2017-12-03 02:23:12
Not 14 if that's what you're getting at. Lol
@_date: 2018-09-13 10:11:20
Fuck the lambos. When school?
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:17:47
It was just some random guy he paid / hired to order and get him the pizzas.

Yes, Tony Hawk invented the word “grind” in his 1999 critically acclaimed video game, Tony Hawks Pro Skater 1.


I think you really summed it up for most people.. But I guess I’m just tired of being like most people.

@_date: 2018-09-29 10:05:30
Because they’re too busy scrolling infinitely, watching cat videos on Facebook to understand that there’s more to life than working for 40 years just to pay the bills and then dying.
@_date: 2017-12-12 13:04:43
For example my dad always tells me 3 times a day "it's fake it's a scam, the Chinese made it and it's going to crash in like 2 seconds!"
Well I'm assuming if it were all a lie (a very complex one at that) I doubt it would of been around this long. Also he's been conditioned by Fox News for the last 20 or 30 years. I try not to pay much attention.
If it just so happens to be fake, I'd rather lose a couple thousand, than lose out on gaining $50 or $100k or more. (I'm guessing)
Im just going to hodl for the long term, ride this crazy ride &amp; see where it takes me.

Yeahh, whatever you say redditor for 3 weeks..
@_date: 2018-08-04 07:13:56
No prob. They got me with their “cash advance interest fees” a bunch when I was buying with my credit card all the time. Who knows, they probably changed it around by now. Maybe they chilled out. It’s all so new to them, none of the banks know what to do haha
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:27:14

@_date: 2018-09-12 15:11:17
I’m guessing people who have millions of dollars to spend aren’t stupid with it, have plenty of it, or are being well advised on how to spend and handle their money. If they’ve truly lost millions on crypto, they have probably only spent what they can afford to lose and or don’t care, or have recouped / offset their losses / made more money with something else by now.
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:05:26
Idk what the website or situation is, but PayPal takes 2.9% normally. So a $6 fee was odd to me.
And I was joking that PayPal must not like you. Like maybe you complained on their $4 fee and they’re like “You no like $4 fee? Well now it $6!” It’s probably a real thing over there.
@_date: 2018-08-31 09:19:00
Idk. Give it a try and report back with your findings.
@_date: 2018-08-05 22:45:59
I’d give my left nut for those kinds of prices.
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:46:29
I would transfer it to a random reddit user such as myself.
@_date: 2018-05-30 05:57:46
$7500, but yeah.
@_date: 2018-05-21 02:59:42
I lol'd as well.
@_date: 2018-08-22 16:23:24
I vote Photoshop. Either that or you really pissed someone off over at PayPal lol. I love crypto but $6 for fees on $100 paypal transaction isn’t a normal occurrence.
@_date: 2018-08-04 02:04:51
I’ve been using the bank transfer method which works fine for me. (USA) Haven’t made any CB deposits lately, but a few weeks ago it worked just fine. No idea if I’ve been “flagged” but they’ve been halfway decent overall.
@_date: 2018-05-21 12:46:34
Can I send it up my own ass ??
@_date: 2018-05-12 05:51:25
Just tell them it's magic internet money.

I will have to message Tom if they do!
@_date: 2018-08-06 07:47:04
Probably all the noobs who bought in @ $19k and were trying to get insta rich and expected huge returns in like 3 seconds. Then they sold a month or two later for pennies on the dollar &amp; hate their lives now.
@_date: 2018-08-01 01:05:57
Says redditor for a day.
@_date: 2018-08-22 17:07:53
I was thinking maybe it was PayPal and eBay fees combined but ive never seen that in 10+ years of using both services. Maybe something with international money conversion? That’s all I could think of.
Idk, I still like crypto better either way.
@_date: 2018-08-31 12:12:17
@_date: 2018-05-05 06:05:31
I already don't have a "real job" so next stop: Financial freedom. Would be nice to not have to check my bank account every time I want to buy something.
@_date: 2018-05-29 02:38:04
I thought this was a shelf of plants in the garden center at Home Depot for a second. Then I looked a little closer.
@_date: 2018-08-23 12:31:10
Yeah that makes sense I guess.

It's the original.
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:51:46
I started with my debit card and then I linked my credit card and CB increased my limits which was nice. I think chase disabled crypto purchases with debit cards in the last couple months tho? You can try it of course, I may be wrong on that one.
I’ve been using the direct bank transfer, but watch out for random chase fees. They were billing me for my crypto credit card purchases labeling it as something random (I forget what they called it. Something with “Interest”) but just be sure to pay it off really quick and I don’t think chase will care. I haven’t paid much on my card so I think that’s why.
Overall chase hasn’t stifled me as much as other banks are stifling or blocking their users that buy crypto. Should be fine.
@_date: 2018-05-24 09:20:14
Buckle up &amp; enjoy the ride.
@_date: 2018-05-12 04:52:38
Probably what op was going for, but the power of suggestion is real. Now it cannot be unseen.

It's the sound my boner makes when it springs up too fast in my pants.

I think the bigger question here is: Are *we* even alive?
@_date: 2018-08-06 17:14:57
You put the $10 away, out of sight. Then you keep putting your $1 dollar bills and other random pocket change in a big jar. When it reaches $100, then you can come back and buy like, lots of bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-05-18 08:53:51
People still watch this garbage?!
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:45:41
Coinbase, bitstamp, etc, etc.
@_date: 2018-05-23 02:40:20
It’s not worth it unless you have a few thousand dollars to dump into actual good equipment.

Send me a pm on this magical website you speak of.
@_date: 2019-11-21 20:46:38
Should be able to, you just wouldn’t be able to check it &amp; see that it came through. So overall, might want to get the internet or check on your cell phone at the least.
@_date: 2019-03-22 04:29:43
I’m assuming it would have stifled growth or something. Few thousand would be fine with me lol. Planning on hopping in your time machine?
@_date: 2019-11-21 15:15:05
I just kind of stopped caring / looking lol
@_date: 2018-10-05 14:58:46
Buy high, sell low.
@_date: 2019-03-23 07:26:36
Make a website that scams BTC from all the scammers.
@_date: 2018-10-05 22:15:34
I actually didn’t see the “serious” part until later. But I probably mostly wouldn’t have cared anyways. If you can’t take a joke or two from strangers on the internet, how can you expect to watch your own portfolio crash and burn on a 40% drop. Lol
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:10:56
I could probably afford a nice framed photo of your island with my portfolio.
@_date: 2018-10-05 15:07:22
Oh, sorry man. That’s the dyslexia talkin.

@_date: 2018-10-14 04:07:34
Mine as well buy 5 lottery tickets at your local 7/11 store.
@_date: 2018-10-20 13:08:04
I’ll sell you all mine for $50 billion. I need to flip them fast &amp; offload them!

Those sure are some expensive ass shorts!
@_date: 2018-06-12 03:06:51
Tell the broker to sell it, then the buyer can pay your friend in BTC and then he can sell X amount to pay any broker fees that are associated with the sale. Do it on site when everyone is in the same room if the broker is being a puss about it.
@_date: 2018-10-13 14:12:58
Probably just doing some test transactions to get it warmed up.
@_date: 2018-06-03 10:26:44
The question is more: If you don’t buy it now, will you regret it later?
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:46:53
Same. And bitstamp, but that’s not as easy.
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:59:05
I’d was going to ask “Who hurt you?” but I’ll just assume it was Coinbase. I have not had any problems with several exchanges. Idk, perhaps I’m just lucky.


Getting it in or out has never really been a problem for me. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2019-08-16 08:31:49
Oh sure! I have an extra 9 coins laying around here somewhere. No need for them, spare change!

@_date: 2018-06-12 05:45:32
Wat?! Have you actually bought anything online? From what I got, you’re making it sound like:
-I pay merchant for item. (In whatever currency)
-Then I call the post office and arrange for them to pickup and ship my newly purchased item &amp; also pay them to ship it to me.
Idk where you buy your things online, but it’s all one smooth seamless transaction. I pay the merchant. They figure out the rest. Then the thing arrives at my door.
@_date: 2018-06-29 14:49:34
When it goes to essentially zero dollars. Then I’ll load my bags even more just in case!

No idea &amp; never thought to look it up. Possibly harder to counterfeit?
Edit: Looked it up. Durability as well.

Buy the deep.
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:55:51
Coinbase is for noobs like the other guy said, but you may want to start there and get a handle on everything first / learn the basics. They make it really simple and easy to comprehend. I came in not knowing anything about stocks, so some of the other complex exchanges looked rather intimidating and confuse the hell out of me!
I’ve also used BitStamp to buy BTC &amp; other altcoins. Look into getting a Ledger Nano to keep them safe if you plan on buying a lot. (Looks similar to a computer flash drive) When you’re ready, get a couple other coins too and diversify.
Ask questions on here and do lots of researching. And as always, never invest more than you’re willing to lose.
@_date: 2018-06-10 02:38:42

@_date: 2018-06-11 19:08:09
So you mean I shouldn’t convert my mums allowance money?
@_date: 2019-08-16 08:29:03
People hate what they don’t understand.
@_date: 2018-06-26 18:03:19
Why haven’t they phased out pennies, nickels, dimes yet?!
@_date: 2018-06-25 13:56:33
I’d say I’d settle for something in the middle, but my portfolio would still basically be red. Hah
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:05:39
I’m not a journalist or anything, but that was the most pathetic article I’ve ever read. Was not aware two sentences could even be considered publishable! A+ for making me want to know more though.

Tell her to pound sand.

You’ll be dying inside on the next bull run. RIP.
@_date: 2018-06-19 17:58:16
I would also probably change your user name, if that’s your actual name in real life. If you’re a big buyer, you don’t want a bright red target painted on your back. Just saying
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:04:00
“In case of emergency, break glass”
@_date: 2019-02-08 10:04:52
Sounds fake &amp; gay.
@_date: 2019-02-02 00:03:37
Why’s that? Jw. And to clarify he worked for me, so for a year or so, he used it for that.
@_date: 2019-02-19 03:20:57
Throw me 0.5 BTC and I’ll brainstorm some more ideas for you.
@_date: 2019-02-23 08:28:49
Not a bad idea. Probably wouldn’t go all in with the $42k but you could comfortably buy a few BTC back and begin to repeat your process.
@_date: 2019-02-19 03:13:40
Sell some of them. That’s about as passive as it gets.
@_date: 2019-02-06 20:26:42
I have no need for this personally, but that’s cool. A+ for the adoption part.
Side Note: Can you redeem or send to other exchanges? Ex: Get the voucher and then have it sent to your coinbase, or Ledger wallet, or something like that?
@_date: 2019-08-16 17:53:41
Was also going to mention brainwashing / the media but figured I’d stick to only one topic. Haha
@_date: 2019-02-07 01:33:53
At least 17.
@_date: 2019-02-04 23:53:32
None. Hopefully it stays that way.
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:32:31
Yeah Coinbase is easy for noobs like me to get started initially. No real trouble, I'm in the US as well. My ID was approved pretty quick, same day I believe.
Recently I filled in the rest of my info to lift my $100 per week limit, it said it was successful or w/e but it is still displaying the limit.
Initially I did a couple test buys a few weeks ago &amp; bought like $250 once or twice, so I don't what that's all about or how it got through. Maybe they weren't paying attention or the limit came later on or something. It's probably good for me either way so I don't go overboard haha.
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:55:08
So it's basically one way only, like sending someone money to their PayPal account using their PayPal email?
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:41:58
Yeah we're like 5 years to late, but that's not stopping me. (Started buying some like 2 weeks ago) I am definitely kicking my 22 - 23 year old self in the ass hah.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:23:51

@_date: 2019-02-03 09:51:08
I don’t beat off on the computer, but this is the reason I taped over my built in webcams lol. I saw that episode of Black Mirror. Sorry bro.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:38:35
Just tell one of your parents to let you sign them up and get the account verified. They'll probably think it's weird &amp; not understand.
Just tell them "It's this thing and we'll make money probably" or if you want to be bold, tell them you'll give them a hundred dollars to sign up, so they know you're serious about this. 70% chance you'll get it back bc what parent would actually take their child's money.
Or just photograph their id and upload it when they're watching tv or something, until you can get your own account verified (probably a bad idea though)
@_date: 2017-11-22 09:06:26
I don't get it. Why wouldn't they buy something at the least lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:34:39
Like, at least 17 watts.
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:06:44
Feel free to send me some too! :)
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:22:34
Stop talking to those people. You don't need that kinda thing in your life lol.
@_date: 2019-02-06 08:38:05
That’s cool. But sounds like a shit ton of work.
@_date: 2019-02-23 10:02:05
I don’t get out much so I have no idea. But I’d buy it from their official website, not from amazon or any other 3rd parties.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:30:33
I was gonna buy one for myself just for the hell of it. And definitely not for that much.
@_date: 2019-02-03 09:57:06
Same but they used my old email. But when I looked on my web host that email was never actually created. (I had: info @ mysite.com - But they were sending from sales @ mysite.com which was either deleted at some point or perhaps has never been an email) 
Pass was old but I still use it. I looked at the email headers &amp; it didn’t look wrong. It was odd, but I’m not super into the technical side of emailing.
@_date: 2019-02-23 09:53:21
I have a Ledger and have never had any problems.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:14:54
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:03:22
If I would have invested $250 back in like 2010 or 2011 when I was 19, I'd have roughly 2500 Bitcoin. Today it'd be worth $23,750,000.
I'd mow some lawns, save your birthday money &amp; buy a couple different kinds of alt coins, study up and learn all you can about crypto &amp; other cool things that interest you.
Worst that can happen is you lose a couple hundred bucks allowance money. Big deal you're 13 still. You have at least the next 5 to 7 years to make it up. Start now and in 10 or 15 years you can thank me, since I'm sure you won't be disappointed with the outcome.
@_date: 2019-02-14 22:50:51
We’re not your friends tho..
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:23:48
@_date: 2017-11-21 11:13:38
I mean, if you don't want them I'll take them off your hands. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:04:04
Pretty sure. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 05:01:44
Do you get a wallet on Gdax or just transfer to Coinbase and gdax is simply used for buying?
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:28:33
Today is the dip if you think about it from the future.
@_date: 2017-11-21 12:27:21
Woah.. That's deep.
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:01:18
I was kinda the same way, but what's the worst Coinbase will do with my id, 85% of my info is already all over google anyways so I just went with it. I'd rather buy in now than miss the boat a second or third time.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:00:42
They do not come stock, but they can modify the regular cup holder with the patent pending Lamborghini Inner Base Cup-Holder Extension XL for the low price of $9,450.
@_date: 2017-11-09 19:08:31
I'm pretty new as well, but basically just forget your bitcoins exist for a while. (I mean look at the charts for the last year or two. They're all over the place) That or only buy what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2019-02-23 21:33:21
Just act like you’re checking out until you get to the payment methods. Then you’ll know.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:51:46
What is Bitcoin: Magic internet money.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:23:16
Couldn't find any but I'm sure they exist.
@_date: 2019-02-03 09:00:20
I just wonder how they email from your domain name. I’m guessing spoofing somehow. Just reply and send him a dick pic lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:27:12
I do have it, not buying tons and tons of Bitcoin. I just don't pay my card off immediately and it sits around till the end of the month. But yeah, I know what you're saying.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:24:19
I lol'd at the part about "Circle jerking freaks" ��
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:08:37
And don't spend your other non-bitcoin money on dumb shit lol. Wish I would of saved all my money back when i was a teenager! Just put it in the bank and forget it exists until you're like 23.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:22:34
What are the fees like &amp; are they a couple bucks each time you buy, or are they a percentage or something? 
Edit: East coast US.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:42:35
Be sure to trade all the big bills in for ones after you stamp them too. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:05:14
You need to make this into an ebook, or video course asap. Need explained in further detail. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:19:31
He's curious / intrigued / skeptical. But so far it's been along the lines of:
Me: So ya going to buy some Bitcoins or what?
"Well I already spent $23k on the new garage"
Me: Well you could of gotten like 3 bitcoins for that.
"What do you get like a coin or certificate or something?!"
Me: No, not really.
"So it's not real?"
Me: About as "real" as the money I have in PayPal.
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:21:01
I just wonder, will it will be fried or oven baked? Perhaps slow cooked? I have so many questions.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:33:26
I don't think so. But now I'm curious lol, I will look.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:21:29
I second both BallsCoin &amp; AmishCoin.
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:52:11
That's crazy! Should of convinced him to offload them and gave him his 500 back ��
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:51:29
Watch your mouth sweetheart.
@_date: 2019-02-01 23:15:54
In 2010 I spent $1200 on a used MacBook Pro. Then I let my friend use it and he basically never gave it back &amp; never cleaned it. Then I think he dropped it down the stairs or something after like 8 years, broke the screen and melted the battery.
I could of bought like 9383884627 bitcoins instead. But no0ooo!
@_date: 2019-12-25 03:22:26
Just looking at this makes my mouth dry lol. Slop some more frosting on there for your family’s sake.
@_date: 2019-12-18 07:08:33
Mostly just: Buy high sell low.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:02:00
I actually just ate a bag of dicks earlier..
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:06:06

@_date: 2019-12-23 08:04:11
Oh lawd jesus ya might have stumbled onto a new venture!
@_date: 2017-11-19 23:24:13
Hell yeah man!

Oh baby, now we’re talkin’
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:24:23
Oh hell, I'd do it at $100,000.
@_date: 2017-11-19 04:53:02
If I find myself trying to buy something dumb like a new $200 watch or something, I usually buy BTC instead. I'm in it for the long run (multiple years) so I basically just buy $X amounts every so often and forget it exists. I try not to pay too much attention to the charts since it's usually all over the place. I only put in what I can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:12:49
Are the big banks still weird about it? I've read they've been closing peoples accounts because they dont like bitcoin I guess. Is that still a thing?
@_date: 2017-11-22 14:31:56
True, never thought about the mining aspect. Anyways, welcome to the club.
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:29:55
I was just doing under $100 for now. Been testing it out for now &amp; then it stopped letting me buy
@_date: 2019-12-19 06:19:01
$2,020 in 2020? Sure. Seems legit.
@_date: 2019-12-27 06:36:13
Your username definitely checks out. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-24 04:00:24
You can store it in my Bitcoin wallet! Just let me know whenever you'd like it back and I'll be sure to give it to you.
@_date: 2019-04-06 07:32:00
Hodor, hodor!
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:26:51
Can I haz 10 billion dollars?
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:09:48
Chase did the same with mine after two small test buys. They probably think it was fraud. I just emailed my bank and explained I'll have transactions from something called Coinbase and it's not fraud so pls stop canceling my shit. (Except it was worded nicer haha)
Haven't had a problem since.
@_date: 2019-02-16 20:38:12

WHAT?! You don't have to print emails??
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:46:18
I guess we'll just have to convince all the companies to accept &amp; keep BTC and stop accepting dirty fiat and credit cards.
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:05:11


I just charged a bunch on my Discover card. I'll just pay it off with the Visa later.

Pls send 0.2 BTC and I will send your newly minted coins to address of choosing..
@_date: 2019-01-11 03:47:41
Cash it in or whatever and say you wiped the hard drive if anyone asks. Finders keepers.
@_date: 2019-01-23 08:51:56
Fine I will give you 3 BTC and maybe I’ll throw in an extra handful of litecoins. But you must pay now. Pls sir.
@_date: 2019-01-13 01:31:22
Did I just take drugs?
@_date: 2018-02-05 09:32:49
Yeah I'd say at least 12 to 16. Not sure tho.

Probably. His little pee-pee is probably stashed somewhere on the blockchain too, that's why he's so concerned..
@_date: 2018-03-15 07:23:25

More like "When floor?" I need to buy some more. Hah

That’s what she said..
Sorry, it had to be done lol

I just said “bitcoin price” and she gave it to me. Doesn’t know any others tho.

He tried to picture clusters of currency as they moved through the computer. What did they look like? Ships, motorcycles. With the circuits like freeways. He kept dreaming of a world he thought he'd never see. And then one day, Satoshi got in..
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:37:31
Hey, whatever you're into man. lol 
@_date: 2018-03-02 06:34:12
That's what I did. Says the ship globally. Probably takes a minute though.
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:26:58
Only $5,000?? Mine as well make it $8,000.
@_date: 2019-01-07 09:37:42
Probably around +$17 dollars. Maybe $17.50. 
@_date: 2019-01-09 06:01:22

Maybe we can all buy lambos then.
@_date: 2018-03-17 14:22:25
What he said.

No thanks, I actually prefer to buy them.
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:50:37
I only invest what I'm willing to lose. And idk how much you're buying or planning on buying, but when I said "a lot of money" I mean like $500 bucks (or less) at a time. Make 4 or 5 buys over a week or two. Not like $25,000 all at once. I'm not that big of a baller lol.

@_date: 2018-02-12 06:46:52
Well you didn't have it before, so you mine as well forget it exists again and come back in another year or two. 
Even if it's worth nothing in a few years it'd be just the same as if you never found it. (I don't see BTC going away tho)
For me, yeah a thousand bucks is cool and all, but it's not life changing at all. I'll spend it on a couple things, pay down a bit on my credit card and it's gone in a couple days. I'm basically back to square one.
If you cashed out now and in 5 years it's worth 10 or 20 times more, are you going to be able to live with that decision, or will you be kicking yourself in the ass for the rest of your life because you sold &amp; lost out?
@_date: 2018-02-20 14:10:32

It's because they briefly overheard Fox News one time, back in December and they remember them saying it was at $19,000.
Then recently they saw some other barley reputable article on the homepage of MSN or Yahoo, etc bashing BTC. They didn't click to read the full article, only saw the headline &amp; how it mentioned it's "a bubble" or "omg it's crashing" and it's now at $8,500.
Basically they're relying on mainstream media too much and doing what my mom does.

Coinbase is super simple, I've never had any problems but a lot of other ppl on here seem to have. (Ill probably get down voted for even mentioning CB lol) It's most likely the easiest, basically they're good for first time buyers and noobs that need something convenient &amp; easy.
I've used bitstamp too. They are decent as well. 
Also just got approved for a robinhood account. They have stocks as well, but haven't let users start buying crypto yet. They are rolling that out in Feb I think for a handful of states in the USA. Also looks super simple from what I saw.

Write a tutorial on "how to get my BTC when I die" and hide it away with all the other important papers. Lock it away or make it look unimportant. Probably wouldn't write the private keys on there though. But then the paper burns if there was a fire. Hmm, I'll have to think some more on this.
@_date: 2018-03-12 10:05:47
Chase. They bend you over with fees if you buy with debit or credit cards. But I recently connected my account into Coinbase and it's been fine.
If they told me "You can't buy that" I'd go directly to the bank and withdraw all my money immediately. I'll buy whatever the fuck I want with my money, aside from crazy things like human sex slaves, or plastic explosives.

For sure. I do think the technology aspect is something we will look at as the "new normal" in the next 5-10 years. Not really worried as it always seems to snap back.
On the other hand, I can lose a few thousand and be fine, it's whatever. Sure I'd be salty but I'll make it back. If I *lost out* on making much more (Ex: $20k, $50k, etc - Who knows) I couldn't live with that, I'd be kicking myself in the ass for the rest of my life.

Coinbase seems fine for the short term. I've never had any real issues &amp; they seem like they have it together quite a bit.
It's not like it's some guy randomly coding the CB website in his moms basement on the weekends, while he attends night classes at his local community college.
It's probably fine for small-ish amounts (couple thousand) or to store coin less than a year or so. I believe they have insurance too, but who knows how that would turn out.

Business expenses.. What are those?
I’m kidding. Right now we are testing crypto, so we only accept part of the invoices in BTC (or several other coins) Probably only 25% for now, so that’s only part of the profits.
We’re not in a big city so I imagine there will be like three people that would actually use it. But maybe it will spark some conversations or something.

Put in a handful of months of learning and reading up first. This ain't some school math test you can halfass and make up later in the year lol.
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:45:35
I haven't tried it with BTC, but I'm sure it's less than Coinbase. I think they have fees listed somewhere on their website. Check in the FAQ maybe.
@_date: 2018-04-01 21:42:13
So sign up for bitstamp or some other exchange.
@_date: 2018-04-06 16:54:17
One was like Jobs For Bitcoin or something. Not sure what it was exactly though.
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:38:47
@_date: 2018-04-03 10:15:16
I just bought some more BTC in like 5.22 seconds. I guess I don't see why it's so hard.
@_date: 2018-07-31 04:52:54
Except I didn’t fail.
@_date: 2018-04-03 00:55:37
So essentially a crypto vending machine? 
@_date: 2018-04-03 07:39:12
We got a jumper. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 23:12:37
Probably not much different than the whales ruling the world now. Except then we'd be using BTC, so it'd be cooler.
@_date: 2018-04-02 09:32:13
Might take longer than 3 or 4 months..
@_date: 2018-04-08 15:04:50
I can wish right?
@_date: 2018-04-06 15:07:38
Okay. I figured it out! My final answer is: 391
@_date: 2018-04-01 02:03:03
Wanna sit on a ledge and shit on people walking by on the street below?
@_date: 2018-04-06 04:59:58


If your concern is a fire burning the seed paper or a flash drive, hammer the words or other info into a metal plate and put it in a fire proof safe. That's what I'm doing at least.
@_date: 2018-04-28 07:43:17
90 mil, that's all?
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:05:40
So who's paying for all these billboards and flyers? I'll design &amp; print the flyers, but I can't do it for free, no matter how much I love crypto. 
@_date: 2018-04-28 03:49:11
Ledger Nano.
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:49:39
I basically did the same thing, but on the way down -___-
@_date: 2019-05-17 08:46:33
Sounds like a lot of work for little to no return.
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:38:09
I may or may not have bought some specialized services.. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)
@_date: 2019-05-14 07:58:24
(Silently weeps in corner)
@_date: 2019-05-14 04:16:15


Can we talk shit in the comments section too??
@_date: 2019-05-17 03:37:18
Bet ya didn’t ever dare to say that last week.
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:48:35
@_date: 2019-05-09 06:06:58
Go on..
@_date: 2019-05-13 06:56:46
“Fat” is subjective. How much do we have to weigh to qualify? 250 lbs or more?
@_date: 2019-05-04 21:30:28
That too.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:40:56
It’s my company but yeah. The only thing I’ll send them, is a link to meat spin. Is that still a thing? Lol
@_date: 2019-05-04 06:18:29
Satoshi himself will sue you.
@_date: 2019-05-14 02:50:05
A lot
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:52:54
Condom, or no condom?
@_date: 2018-12-08 19:22:24
Because it’s like a bank. And banks also want your social.
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:26:43
Well that escalated quickly lol.
@_date: 2019-05-02 00:57:14
Get friends, or a cousin or something to help. I’d say Local Bitcoins but that could get sketchy.
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:26:36
Thank you sir. At least you made my time clicking-in slightly less of a waste.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:46:07
The funny thing is that’s a totally unused email / domain / business name. We stoped using it 3 years ago but still get them forwarded for straggler customers.
Contact emails were still possibly scraped out I assume.
I’m guessing there’s no actual Trojan garbage on the computer so if I login to the web host and change the email pass I’m not compromising myself further?
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:40:59
I’m about to. Either that or send him a pic of my butt hole.. Or maybe just memes. Lol
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:28:32
I know it’s fake, or mostly fake. Trying to figure out what the next move should be to secure my email and stuff.
@_date: 2018-12-19 21:45:11
Sounds like a lot of work.
@_date: 2019-05-15 05:41:56
Go for it and report back in a few years.
@_date: 2018-12-09 13:46:15
Looks like they’re coming out the other end as we speak,
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:30:42
Jokes on them. I’ll leak my nudes all by my damn self lol.
@_date: 2018-12-07 10:16:16
Sob quietly in the corner &amp; refuse to sell.
@_date: 2018-12-03 23:38:13
It’s on sale &amp; still works.
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:36:24
Bunch of random numbers and stuff, then @ my real domain. So I’m assuming they got the pass somehow. Was kind of weak anyways.
@_date: 2018-12-20 22:37:14
Maybe I’ll get a gf already. Haha
@_date: 2019-05-14 04:10:12
Welcome to the club.
@_date: 2019-05-17 07:33:14
Let me guess. Someone emailed you and they’re going to leak your pee-pee pics unless you pay them lots of bitcoins
@_date: 2019-05-04 13:09:17
I’ve never had a problem. Buy a Ledger Nano wallet if you’re planning on spending a lot and move it off the exchange.
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:39:19
So what you’re saying is I should of sent him bcash instead?
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:38:40
1. I know I’m not alone. Seems pretty common. Wasn’t sure what to do to correct the email password issue.
2. I don’t even have a webcam lol. I barely use my laptop which has one built in but there’s tape over it. I never use the laptop for those purposes. Everything else has tape or camera blocker things over the front cameras. ����
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:43:11
Haha. I’m smart, but not that smart.
@_date: 2018-12-20 02:58:31
Buy more.
@_date: 2019-05-14 06:14:31
The dude abides.
@_date: 2018-12-20 17:42:28
Or better yet “How get bit coin??”
