Not all polls will say the same thing though. You can choose whichever you like to believe or to take an average even. I simply don't give them much credence since it seems like many have a biased motive, including Trump's.

I'm not saying it was really bad before, just that people want to give Obama credit for the current state of things. Looks like annual GDP growth will be better than any year under Obama though and the dow jones will have the largest YoY % increase since 2013. This all comes after people predicted the apocalypse when he took office, and now it's just funny that the goalposts have shifted to 'everything's all good, but it's not because of him'. 
Doesn't really matter though since we can all enjoy it regardless.

That's not the impression I got with everyone saying there was no chance in hell. 
I'd wager it's probably the same though I don't pay attention enough to really know or care.

Problem is that the number of biased polls might be larger in one direction versus the other.

Perhaps regulatory cuts had an impact, or market speculation for the impending corporate tax cut. Wouldn't be surprised to see it just get better from here, especially since Q3 was marred by 3 cats. Individual quarter gdp isn't as good of an indicator as annual though.

That's strange, because people love to talk about Obama being responsible for the current economy. I wonder why.

Based on polls? lol
