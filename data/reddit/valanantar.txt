Sorry but are you asking a government to bail out from your own responsibilities? Rent money?

Would Apple block their app if they add bitcoin as an option?

If the banksters tell you they are the light, then it would make sense this project is its opposite as Dark.
I am glad all those postings here now will have the next generation and the generation after that be mocked at. We are such a superficial generation right now. Keep your eyes on the prize .

He is for it if the money goes to his campaign. Not so much if the same right is allowed to the Koch Brothers.
"Are you kidding me! Of course i would accept bitcoins"
I am glad the network is politically blind.

If an independent mainstream media talks about bitcoin that is fine. A government's nudged media will push whatever agenda their master tells them too. You are forgetting too quickly how relentless for the msm bitcoin was a: a joke, b: only for drugs, c: dead for good? We should never forget what they are up to. they are not the bitcoin's friend. They are the FED's friend.

Because a lot is about power and hypocrisy. Asking the question is proof it was but a show. Remember Russel Simon? He was all over O W S, like a fly on S What was he pushing while saying he was against the banks?
Rushcard: a prepaid VISA card with his face on it. No need for a link, it is easy to find. This "process" is part of human nature, part of our DNA. Take a tribe made of 100% republicans. No matter what some will be more conservatives, some more liberals. Same with a democrat tribe. By not having the human make the decision and have an algorithm in place of its core will eliminate any coloration or take over from an simple but powerful idea regarding money and its purpose. Again, another example why Bitcoin is so powerful.
