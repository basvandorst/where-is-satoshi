The dudes an idealistic dreamer, I see nothing wrong with him choosing to save bitcoins and be homeless if thats what makes him happy.  If it doesnt workout how he wants reality will give him an ass kicking and he will have to decide which way to go then.  But if its working for him, whys he that crazy for wanting a different way of life? 
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:14:01
Wow, so "fearLess" of you.
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:52:44
Thanks thats amazing, but i meant more in a commercial that merchants can say woah those big guys are doing it too.
@_date: 2014-12-27 05:20:39
Well by bitpay being aggressive with the PR they will get more love overtime. So it balances out if coinbase doesnt step up as much. 
@_date: 2014-01-31 17:41:59
Cool, doge is almost at 50k in a month, so get those server names ready but congrats to the pioneer bitcoin!

Site owners would make a killing in advertising if they did that, even if there was no rake or a very small rake. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 04:42:33
But i wonder if they could have mentioned big name companies that accept bitcoin through them in some way, that would have been huge.
@_date: 2014-04-04 17:50:17

@_date: 2014-02-04 08:00:36
Lot a hate going on, I like both coins for their own reasons.   I think the Doge community is going to make this thing explode, it's relentless.  I was annoyed at first by the talk abut that's only a side product of it and it doesn't bother me anymore, plus I love dogs.  Bitcoin is the master and pioneer and is doing well and paving the way.  There is room for both coins and we should be celebrating the popularity of crypto currencies.  You can use and invest in both. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 00:59:48
Yup that's it, thanks.  Guess people didn't like it and downvoted, so ehh.

It's not a scam, I made a living for 2 years playing online poker and did well.   I moved on when they made it illegal in the states and decided to get into other ventures but it worked great when I did play.   Stressful with all the ups and downs but if you're disciplined you can make it work good. 
@_date: 2014-12-27 04:56:38
Took my dumbass couple years, always thought people were mentioning a world of warcraft currency in an internet marketing forum i was in.  If i would have clicked on the threads i could be filthy rich by now.   BUT when i heard people talk about it in person I instantly researched it.  So hopefully the seeds work on people.
@_date: 2014-12-27 08:55:42
You obviously didn't read his post jackass.  Try again.  Just because you can't imagine a life without a 9-5 and no bank account doesnt mean others can't have an enjoyable life without it.  How the fuck do you know what OP is about in 2 paragraphs.   Get back in your box brain dead.

I heard someone say you can use paypal through circle to buy bitcoins is that true? I have people ask me about using paypal to buy bitcoin sometimes and i tell them virox but it has crazy fees.  Is Circle bank only?
@_date: 2014-12-27 04:44:51
2.9% is nothing compared to some of these paypal fly by night exchanges i have seen.
@_date: 2014-12-26 23:38:30
Use coinbase but you have to use your bank account not paypal.  But you get more bang for your buck than places that use paypal, usually you get less for your money.  You can do extra security and authentification if youre worried about it.

Virox is an option but you have to buy currency then swap it for bitcoin.  You lose a lot of money most times when paying with paypal, better to go with CC or bank account if possible.
