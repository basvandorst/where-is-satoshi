Satoshi per byte

take the fee you paid, in Satoshis, divided by the size of the transaction, in bytes, and you'll have the fee you paid in sat/byte.
I'm curious how this need further explanation.

I question why you think "we're a long ways off", OP has video of it working on mainnet across three different implimentations. 
I would even argue that we currently dont have a scailing problem, we have a failure to promptly upgrade problem. looking at you coinbase, segwit, hello? 
a million different scailing solutions could exist and if none ever used them... do we still have a scailing problem?
we have scailing now, *we just need to use it*

bigger blocks would make it more vulnerable. i would also like to live in this utopian paradise where fees are zero and spam is but a distant memory... but let's not fool ourselves, fees are what deter spam. the larger the block, the cheaper the fees, the more spam incurred. it's pretty basic economics. 
i think we need to ask ourselves where is this spam originating from?
is it high traffic from tumblers? ok cool, lets get Schnorr signatures enable so we can aggregate those into smaller packages.
is it HFT from exchanges, or coffee addicts operating on the global market? ok cool, lets get LN up and going so we can aggregate those hundreds of transactions into two transactions.
i'll agree we need bigger blocks in the long run, but i'll adamantly disagree that we need them before addressing these scaling issues. and guess what? guess what segwit is? guess what is sitting in code right now?
bitcoin doesn't need a breath... a few ignorant/misinformed/stubborn/ego maniacal people do. or better yet, let them hold their breath until they pass out, fall down, and fade from relevance.

there are multiple proofs that show the impossibility of solving the two general's problem, [one can be found here](  bitcoin is the first practical method to address this problem in the real world, however, it is *not* a solution to the problem. it's "good enough" to work for our needs though.  sure, i'm being pedantic, but you simply cannot solve the problem.

Trezor's 24 word recovery phrase is based on [bip39]( and as such any software/hardware that conforms to the standard will be able to recover the wallet with said keywords.

ah, I think I see what you mean. like, does the browser sign with the keys itself... or is there a daemon running that the browser simply talks to.

with [Shamir's Secret Sharing]( you can get like Harry Potter and spread the seed into multiple horcrux... and even use something like [shamir39]( to retain nice bip39 like words.

this seems to give wallet access? below permission it states wallet access: i can choose between  btc, ltc, or eth wallet... but i cant choose none.
