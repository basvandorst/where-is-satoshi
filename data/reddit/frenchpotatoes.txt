Yep. I brought Ethereum on the 23rd for the first time. This is my ledger that I'm working on so far.

This. I was planning on putting $40 every Friday. I might do your suggestion instead.

I would buy just a bit right now, or else you might miss out who knows. My first BTC transaction was like $25 bucks. Worth it

You could buy now, or you could wait for a crash. It's up to you. Put in a small amount, like $10 if you don't want to spend too much. I've been watching the price all night and it's been pretty volatile.

You can try coinbase, but they charge fees.
There is also kraken, but you have to verify yourself. ( I found it to be tiresome.)

Mine seem to be working...

I made it myself on excel. I was trying to make it look fancy...!
I do wish I could invest more! On the plus side, LTC is going up like crazy!

Holy shit. Paging @_date: 2017-09-01 15:03:32
Yeah the other two I have invested in are etherium and light coin. I am still wondering what to do with them. I might buy and sell the light coin since I got 2 ltc when it was $63 and now it's around 80$

Why is that? I'm curious

My boyfriend's brother in law said the same thing. But I kind of refrained from selling on Friday and held onto my BTC and it kind of went up from my original buying price of 4171 to what it is now. I wish I had purchased more than 90 bucks worth ha

Hey that's pretty cool. What language did you use? C++? I want to do that but I was thinking of using Java
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:45:34
It's basic verification if I recall correctly, like a driver's license or something. They also verify your card/bank by depositing two small amounts into it and then asking you how much they have deposited.
For $120 right now, the fee would be $4.79.
You would pay $124.79 and receive 0.02513028 BTC.

I didn't know Ripple was ranked higher than LTC.

Yess! I got some when it was $4171! Super excited :D
