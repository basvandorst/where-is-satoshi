Looks like it’s staying still for now after a bit of rapid buys and sells

My friend just sold his house and went all in on ripple, absolutely true bought 175k at 80cents
Nice move but I told him to buy xvg at 8 cents he did buy 10k then sold it, he now wants to buy at 23

Lots of buys vs lots of sells, which will run out first can do either way? 
 Now dropping perhaps this is the beginnings of a dip?

I wanted to buy one btc but don’t  like coinbase fees
I’m waiting now to hop on as it looks like it might drop before it rally’s like it has previously and I’m not in fomo, however if I miss the buy in on  it I will buy half a coin and probably look towards eth ltc or mix in some small cap alts?
My only worry is that normally when I go in to something it’s late��
I’m in the UK can we buy you n Gdax there

$9143 is this going to hold because it looks like it is, flying up like a rocket, I took a sell position thinking it will drop��

Being a newbie is a hard time working out what to buy not buy when to sell when to hold.i ha e made the mistake in the last month to buy alts and it has not been great.
So say tomorrow I have $7000 in my hand, do I 
A, buy 1 btc and get the free cash and hope it does not crash too badly? Or sell very quick hopping back on at the low.
B. Wait for the segwit to happen and a dip then buy 7k of btc to hodl.
As everyone on here I want to get the best deal out of the situation coming up, nobody really knows what will happen I guess, but if history repeats itself it will craaash, thing is it might be a very small fast  crash with a fast recovery as I also feel we are going to witness something of a magnitude coming  in from the fiat ??? Perhaps there could also be a mass exodus into litecoin or other ?? This is just my take on things, remember one thing sometimes not knowing the game can make you see a more disruptive future from a very different perspective
Hope I don’t get bad votes as I need good ones please

I know btc is at an ath, would you guys buy right now just say one or two, will there be any major dips in the coming days in light of the fork? Me thinks not and think I should buy one for investment not for trading, perhaps it will reach the magic figure one day. 
Also where is the most reasonable place to buy btc with fiat as I use coinbase but it charges a lot
