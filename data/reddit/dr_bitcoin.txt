Try this - 
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:27:01
Nothing you can do about that...can't find any information just from a address. The only ways would be how you were in contact with him, did you message him on skype or some type of messenger?
You got tricked by the ol' teamviewer lock mouse hack. Teamviewer should really disable that.. They have a specific option that's called 'Disable Mouse' that will disable your mouse but not the remote assistant.. 
edit: I guess you just left it open, nevermind. The hack you're talking about happened to a lot of people
Right here: 
@_date: 2016-08-06 18:17:07
Lol would you rather have them file bankruptcy and you get nothing? The solution they're doing is that everyone will get their money back.
@_date: 2016-08-06 17:51:41
I don't see why some people are complaining about the outcome, I mean at least they didn't file bankruptcy and give anyone's money back at all forcing every single person to waste money going to court and even at they may not get any money back. They supplied a plan that will get everyones money back that has been lost. Much better then the Mt Gox outcome.
(Not saying you're complaining OP, in general)
@_date: 2016-08-07 03:33:36
Prob downloaded a scammed version, apple has been accepting a lot of scam wallets... Someone should sue them?!
@_date: 2016-08-22 20:27:50
Not even close.. you own your private keys on blockchain.info
@_date: 2016-08-09 19:47:34
Cmon guys
 can you show us what you use to decrypt the hash
@_date: 2016-08-08 08:18:20
Didn't read,
but on another note. I don't even want to come to anymore at this point. A new bitfinex post every 10 minutes is getting extremely annoying and the mods should make a master thread for it. They told you the plan, everyone is just saying the same old shit
@_date: 2016-08-15 18:52:41
They do have horrible grammar, I think they mean 1 Million USD total in bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:16:04
Probably getting way to much traffic.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:07:57
Good thing you can use file recovery systems, also usually when you reformat your computer it will go to your C:/ a copy of the old data. That's if you're using windows. It would be like C:/Old
If you're using windows/apple you can download recovery programs to recover the text document. That's assuming you didn't encrypt your hard drive
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:06:00
Yeah, pirated
@_date: 2016-08-24 01:36:40
I just purchased something of NewEgg with bitcoin less than a month ago. I'm sure they still have it.
@_date: 2016-08-16 01:53:20
I'd send it back, if you spend it you're screwed. But if you send it back you'll get a small bounty sure, but you'll also be helping tons of people and giving more hope for bitcoin again
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:21:43
Fiat wasn't stolen, so no.
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:31:52
Yeah you got hacked by the main stream hack that just happened to teamviewer most likely. Did you have it setup for remote desktop 24/7  with your email? You should uninstall teamviewer. I would never use them again, I uninstalled them 2 months ago when this breach happened.
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:41:40
Lol I guarantee every single user here as downloaded pirated software or pirated anything, you're just as bad this guy he just got caught
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:32:29
LOL, EXACTLY.
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:42:44
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:21:37
Yeah. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency that the govt doesn't have control of
@_date: 2015-12-28 22:27:45
I'm assuming this is the transaction:
@_date: 2015-12-24 20:45:23
Well, I plan on selling it haha
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:20:01
I didn't purchase any of the coins, they were all obtained thru online services I  have done.  Nothing links to my SS or name. They have never been on an online exchange either. All on my bitcoin qt client.
@_date: 2015-12-24 18:16:49
LBC doesn't require SS or ID to trade through?
@_date: 2015-12-24 20:46:00
User, Dr_Bitcoin doesn't link to anything, or IP related. lol
@_date: 2017-02-24 06:24:22
You can easy do it thru localbitcoins 
Some methods
* Bank Deposit - Easy (You'll have to open trade and you'll lose like $30/btc)
* Western Union (Set up your own sell and sell it for current exchange rate, tons of people will do this). Do like $4k/day or more if you want, sometimes WU will flag your name then you can't anymore. Rare.
* Moneygram - Up to $2k max per transaction, I haven't done more in a day as I'm not sure if they flag, but i's fairly easy.
* Cash in hand: Easy.. Make sure you bring something with you in case someone attempts to mug you(happened to someone like a week ago). You can also meet up with some of the big people, might have to drive very far though... I had one guy offer to meetup half way which would require driving 2 states for cash as not many people can do that much in cash. You won't be able to get $300k in cash. If you do cash I recommend buying a counter/fraud detector.
Source: I have sold tons of bitcoin
If you're trying to stay off the records, do low amounts(Make sure to pay taxes!). WU is random usually amounts over $3k they will ask for your SSN and Copies your license. Moneygram takes a copy of your license. Bank you have to require your name and stuff, so your bank logs it obviously. Only off the record way is Cash in hand which can be sketch to.
@_date: 2016-03-18 18:13:30
You can use cash at localbitcoins, just have to find someone selling it in your area.
@_date: 2017-03-10 05:02:02
@_date: 2017-03-12 17:26:39
I laugh at the people who panic sold just because of the ETF...
edit: I get downvoted by the people who sold lol, weak hands I tell ya
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:53:13
1. Sell bitcoin on Exchange with higher price
2. Deposit to Paypal
3. Deposit Paypal to Bank
4. attach bank to cheaper exchange
5. buy from cheaper exchange
6. Repeat
but yes they take a while, and long process
@_date: 2016-03-10 02:35:43
What would be cool is if you added in CSV import for the 'To' field,
    Name, Street, AptSuite, City, State, Zip
    Joshua, 99th Ave, Apt 4, Miami, Florida, 83932
    Joshua2, 99th Ave2, Apt 5, Miami, Florida, 84922
Or make it so you can do bulk shipping, and make bulk address labels.
Also looks like an exact copy of -   ?
@_date: 2017-03-11 18:16:25
Hahahahhahaaha, it's okay :) The bitcoin price is right back where it is despite the ETF denial. I haven't sold a single coin still :)
@_date: 2017-03-10 05:01:40
Then bet against me
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:01:24
Because the USA is the super power
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:15:21
I'm definitely not panicking lol, I'm just grade a shit posting. Waiting for the ETF decision either price wil go up or downn
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:46:43
ETF will probably be delayed again so they don't put it live at it's TOP and lose all the investors money
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:33:20
At china's rate, they'll see the price go up $50 and dump all their coin
@_date: 2017-03-08 03:45:46
Thus dropping the price bruh
@_date: 2017-03-10 05:01:52
You have to create an account, just email and password.
@_date: 2017-03-10 05:05:01
It's based off by how many people are betting against it. The more people who bet "NO" the odds will go up. The odds are really high for "NO" because of my $800 bet on "Yes" 
@_date: 2017-03-10 06:01:08
That's ok, I wanted to make a bet
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:46:04
Ohh, not sure about that one :/
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:55:00
Eh I was just kinda referencing this,
"Jeff Bishop, ETF expert and co-founder of investor message board platform RagingBull.com, speculated that, in the end, the SEC could punt its decision further past the 11th – particularly in light of recent price gains."
""I have the feeling they will find a way to delay this even more though. With bitcoin at all-time highs and the SEC having a terrible record for allowing new ETFs to come to market at absolute tops, they will likely push back on this until things cool a bit," he said."
They will probably try and find a way
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:47:28
Y'all are chickens
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:30:57
The .67 on yes was me ;)
@_date: 2017-03-10 05:05:21
Oh yes, I believe so, You supplied your btc address yeah? You should be able to, not sure how it works. I just created an account, didn't know you can without
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:25:41
If I lose you guys can win my monies!
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:17:40
No no, I won't be selling either. I'll most likely hold still. I don't want to be taxed 20% I'm to greedy for that. (Capital gains tax is 20% here)
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:47:48
Invest all your life savings to make profit, go big or go home... or under a piece of cardboard
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:10:26
Now place the bitcoin on a second bet
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:59:22
yeah yeah yeah, I have lost quite a bit in bad trades before. I just didn't this time lol
@_date: 2017-03-08 03:47:14
Continue with your story please, tell me more
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:16:49
That's why
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:56:43
BTC-E, $565 they are full of panic sellers so cheap bitcoinz
@_date: 2016-06-17 23:37:57
Good ol' Uncle sam
@_date: 2016-06-17 23:34:27
Well yeah, I can do that. But I mean, that much is kind of risky.
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:46:34
@_date: 2016-06-21 03:46:30
Ouch that would hurt lol
@_date: 2016-06-21 10:13:19
@_date: 2017-03-08 04:14:23
OF course, I'm in it for the long run as well. I have coins back from when they were about $90. But meh, my coins are probably about 80% of my net worth. Buttt that's just because the price has risen. If it would drop to $200 I'd still be in the profit zone, I'm just greedy and want it to hit $2k+ already
@_date: 2016-06-21 02:49:53
I'm saying I have $200k in digital funds, I Trust that bitcoin will go up. Oh no, put a target on my head guis, send an executable virus to me, send me a phishing link, send me all you got o noesss
I'm not an idiot and know how to secure funds
@_date: 2016-06-03 04:24:31
I don't know why more people don't mention it...but
I use them for business, have automatic deposits on and its the best!
You can setup 'Pay now' buttons, or call backs, so on so on. All the same as the above, but better.
I have been using them for about 3 months now as a Merchant with 0 problems, and I can accept Credit Card/Bitcoin with them.
@_date: 2016-06-17 23:42:44
So I would add it to my W-2 essentially, and that would go towards my annual income?
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:17:58
Bought 20 @ $683 lol

@_date: 2016-06-22 01:51:46
None of my post contain any pesonal/specific information lol, tons of people in the USA/Australia/ have $200k
@_date: 2016-06-05 00:12:36
Ah I see, well at least it's not use dealing with Coinbase and they deal with it
@_date: 2016-06-18 00:24:29
The supply of bitcoins is not getting reduced by 50%, the output of bitcoin is getting reduced by 50%. Going over $1k isn't a for sure thing and there will be a risk either way. That's why I said don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Invest, and think you've already lost it already just in case.
@_date: 2016-06-24 02:36:00
!remindme 1 week
@_date: 2016-06-23 00:21:56
Price will rise again, no need to worry if you sell you lose profits
@_date: 2016-06-22 01:51:06
LOL, That's why I have my guns ;)
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:55:41
@_date: 2016-06-03 04:40:01
Yep, I was too looking for a new payment processor other than Coinbase and Bitpay and stumbled upon this a few months ago.
@_date: 2016-06-21 00:49:06
LOL, don't give in. This is the definition of "Panic Seller", Just hold. I have over 300 bitcoin I am holding at the moment. Not going to sell, it could be because bitfinex has a lot of trading that isn't happening right now. Bitcoin is going to hi $1,000 soon. Just be patient
@_date: 2016-06-03 04:25:41
Yes! It's the best. You just have to enable "Bitcoin" payment option in your account
edit: 
edit2: I also haven't had any "Harsh" verification things like Coinbase does, Where they make you submit, everything
Edit3: But I heard they do go thru coinbase, but I guess we're on their "end" 
@_date: 2016-06-09 07:59:28
Can't take my bitcoin! Now I won't want to travel with a credit card either.
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:00:28
Just buy more whenever it drops, that's what I do :)
@_date: 2016-06-21 07:41:10
@_date: 2016-06-21 07:06:04
Lol, just because I said something about it. it's not secure?
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:46:37
Yes, then everyone panic sells, than whales come back and buy up all the cheap bitcoin than we go to moon
@_date: 2016-06-24 03:29:18
You mean just gained 10% in value with pound, inflation m8
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:02:02
Yeah that's good! I'll be buying about 20 bitcoin in the next hour, such an easy gain 
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:01:11
If it hits $660 I'll buy in more, maybe $680
@_date: 2016-06-03 17:59:01
Not sure honestly. I just know they work.
@_date: 2016-06-05 00:16:17
I've been holding a couple months, since $380 however long ago that was off the top of my head it's about 2 months or so making some awesome gains off this rise, still holding.
@_date: 2016-06-24 03:52:59
Oh, I thought if the value went down the price would increase for homes to compensate? But then again idk lol
@_date: 2016-06-21 01:18:15
@_date: 2016-06-21 07:57:06
Yeah true true, I didn't start investing till less than a year ago but its never to late! :d
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:50:56
Yeah, I had the same question a long time ago ;)
@_date: 2016-06-23 01:46:21
@_date: 2016-12-08 08:25:59
Best of luck to you! The website looks quite nice
@_date: 2016-06-17 23:36:36
I believe you should wait, I mean maybe till after the halving now that's when I suspect their will be a dip/buy in time. At the moment the price may go up, but if you're afraid to lose $25k I wouldn't do it and wait.
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:47:24
Change address m8, depending on what wallet you own it may show the change address in your receiving addresses. But you still own it
@_date: 2016-06-22 23:45:22
Right hahhaa, I'm not even bothered by the price dropping as long as it's above $380 I'm still in the profit zone, but I still think it will rise soon
@_date: 2016-12-29 07:24:07
China hasn't received news yet
@_date: 2016-12-29 06:49:04
 
IT STILL WORK!
@_date: 2016-11-05 09:17:07
They have for an extremely long time lol
@_date: 2016-12-22 09:45:17
Very true, if the price drops $100 I don't even care. It's a forever rollercoaster
@_date: 2016-02-20 17:30:37
Oh I see... blah, I guess that happened when I used the 'sweep' function in blockchain wallet to sweep all my other addresses...
I wonder how long this will take then lol,
thanks for the quick response!
@_date: 2016-02-21 21:40:44
The miners still don't like m transaction.. do you know how to fix this?
@_date: 2016-02-21 23:32:59
Anyway to go about fixing this? I use blockchain.info and I don't want all my coins in void forever
@_date: 2016-02-03 21:50:48
@_date: 2016-02-21 23:33:10
Anyway to go about fixing this? I use blockchain.info and I don't want all my coins in void forever
@_date: 2016-02-03 21:13:34
Oh really? So every time I go to 'File -&gt; Receiving addresses -&gt; New' it already technically created it before hand? 
Well that's good to know. I have 57 addresses in total, so the other 43 addresses are already pre-created but won't show up till I click 'new address'?
@_date: 2016-09-28 21:03:49
You did a $12 fee for the new transaction. I'm sure it will be accepted before the old one
@_date: 2016-09-27 17:35:38
Not 100% sure it was my Bitcoin, but I assume so. I was using  for payments and had USD deposited to my Business Checking. Bitcoin is the only reason I can see them closing my accounts, since all I use my personal checking for is to pay bills and transfer money from my business checking to my personal and what not.  It's been fine for about 11 months now accepting payments, not sure what happened.
@_date: 2016-09-27 23:58:11
Yeah I called and asked them, they said under their policy they can close my account for any reason they want. They didn't have a specific reason, they just said "It's in our best interest to stop our relationship with you" didn't cite any policy I violated, read the whole policy to and none of it I violated.
@_date: 2016-09-27 23:59:11
None in my area lol :(
@_date: 2016-09-27 17:50:07
I wish I could do that... hmm
@_date: 2016-09-21 23:09:51
Nah, they only reply fast to people on reddit due to them trying to keep their reputation or something. Just wait, within the hour they will give you their reddit specific email for you to email them there.
@_date: 2016-09-28 04:24:04
Whattttttt, really? I'll try it out then.
@_date: 2016-09-03 00:36:51
I shall now double spend everywhere!
@_date: 2016-09-27 23:58:54
Yeah was thinking of a credit union.. will look into that
@_date: 2015-09-03 04:06:18
I wouldn't think so, I was just kidding hahaha
@_date: 2016-10-09 21:57:28
Ah I see, I guess I wasn't thinking of that lol I can probably do that.
@_date: 2016-10-26 02:02:19
Yeah haha, I was surprised myself because I thought I made the fee higher and when I checked it was 2 cents :o
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:37:30
proof haz been given
@_date: 2016-10-28 16:16:09
Eh, I use to think that. I would get scared when bitcoin price would have those huge drops of about $150-$200 and would panic sell like everyone else and I'd end up losing money. Nowadays I don't care if the bitcoin price dropped $300, nor do I panic sell anymore I just hold and let it do its thing because every single time it has dropped, it has gone up plus more and say it dropped $400 tomorrow, I still wouldn't sell a single bitcoin because the next day it can be back up again, which it **always** does
@_date: 2016-10-26 19:10:27
Ah I see, must have not paid attention then. Still a small fee ;)
@_date: 2016-10-26 01:40:31
Eh, I sent a $13k transaction when there was 42k unconfirmed transaction with a 2 cent fee. Got 3 confirmations in about 30 minutes, so 1 confirmation every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2016-10-26 01:41:42
Super late response, but I did what you essentially said above and it all worked out :) Just used their unarchive function in the API. Not sure why I did not think of it before.. lol
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:35:32
My fee was 0.0000371 for my $100 transaction just going through fine. (3 cent fee)
@_date: 2016-10-26 18:37:33
proof haz been given
@_date: 2017-05-04 22:07:15
You obviously haven't been paying attention, but btc-e has been in the 1400's when every other exchange was at 1600's for a while now. Now at $1550. Not sure why people are freaking out about a $70 drop when it has gained like $400 in a few days
@_date: 2015-11-04 05:49:02
Do not buy coin right now. All we're waiting for is that huge $-150 crash
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:11:41
OH YEAH. I've made $22.2k in the last week off the raise ;)
@_date: 2017-05-19 00:45:07
I messed up, I get it ok I'll put my head on the block for you
@_date: 2016-05-25 04:12:45
Blocks are indeed full, I have a transaction of $1.2k, transaction of $500, and transaction of $200 that have been waiting to confirm for about an hour plus now. Both have a decent fee as well.
@_date: 2017-05-11 17:54:14
Price is just pure retarded at the moment in my opinion, I know people are going to disagree with me but the price has gone up WAY to fast even with the Japan situation. A big bubble will soon burst, but when it does burst at least people can hop in and get cheaper coins for the next ATH
@_date: 2017-05-05 05:25:07
They have always been like that, they're always under market price. Like, literally always. lol.
It's probably because it's harder to get cash in the exchange. What people usually do is transfer their bitcoin there and do trades and then transfer their bitcoin to a different exchange to cash out.  BTC-E is quite nice since it requires 0 verification, but when you have 100+ bitcoin on there doing trades they require you to setup 2-factor authentication in order to deposit\withdrawal which is totally reasonable since its such a large amount.
@_date: 2016-05-21 20:58:58
The tool didn't defunct them, TeslaCrypt released their master private key allowing for anyone to decrypt.
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:56:00
Lol no
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:21:20
One of the most dumbest things someone can ever do lol
@_date: 2016-10-28 18:55:02
Yes it hasn't recovered all the way to $1,200, but it has dropped down to about $150 as well after being at the high of $1,200 and it's now almost at $700 again unless another exchange gets hacked, which seems to always happen when the bitcoin price is going strong for a while. It really does always recover, although $1,200 will take longer but it will still recover eventually
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:24:45
$1750 can buy a car, not a good one but it can get a car
@_date: 2017-07-09 01:53:02
Just emailed them, not sure how this card was even used. It was a prepaid credit card with about $1,000 on it and haven't used it in months. I use it for 1 transaction today at a restaurant and after that it was used for coinbase.com lol

Yeah but for them to go to coinbase, or even know about bitcoin is kind of weird.. especially since my name is "Dr_Bitcoin" , I'm an IT guy as well and I have 0 viruses, for sure. I mean if I had a virus I'm pretty sure they would rather have stolen the bitcoin on my bitcoin-qt lol

Not sure why I got down voted.. but it got confirmed. Here is 2 transactions for reference, 
It did take over an hour to confirm. Which I assume was because the blocks were full.

Yeah seriously....
I accidentally sent two $1200+ transactions with 25 set/byte last night and was like wtf when it got accepted 5 minutes later..

I don't have a coinbase account.

Yeah just looked it up, and only saw a FAQ with a contact page saying they'll take several days to respond.
Welp, I guess they'll be out a good $800

Yes I did that right away, was just trying to be courteous and contact coinbase so they can stop them from transferring out bitcoin if they processed it already. I mean I own a business to and I wouldn't like it if I got a $800 chargeback

That's what I'm saying! hahaha

bruh i don't even know anymore. I been a solid hodler for like 3 years. Bitcoin price went to 2700+ dropped to 1700, went back up to in the 2000's and I sold a huge stash of my bitcoin. look what happened to me, I sold $600 less then what the current price is, and that was just 2 days ago. Buy buy, never sell. I just finally made that mistake ;( sad day, still in profit tho
