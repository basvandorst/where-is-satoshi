Nothing is inevitable and this kind of stupidly simplistic way of "investing" money is what leads to bubbles.  
It's always going back up.. until it doesn't.

I'm following this sub mainly for entertainment at this point.  The amount of delusion and memes is... cultish.  The behavior on this sub is so representative of a textbook case of a bubble right before it bursts.  I don't think many people here even understand the underlying technology beyond a TL;DR.  (It can't POSSIBLY drop anymore BUY BUY BUY, LOOK AT THE PAST 5 TIMES IT DROPPED LOL ITS OBVIOUSLY GOING TO $1MM)
I have a hard time believing people here have thought critically about what justifies the $X billion dollar 'market cap' of Bitcoin.  They just see an exponential graph and lose their minds. 
I think this sub used to be for tech savvy people that enjoyed the technology now it's just a safe space/echo chamber for degenerate gamblers.      
It's just such a textbook example of a bubble. There's such hysteria. Very little logical discussion. This subreddit alone is reason enough for any BTC "investor" to reevaluate their position.
