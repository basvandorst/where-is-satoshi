Well, having an BofA account has its benefits. Maybe the benefits are greater than the costs of dicking around. Idk

Most investing apps (Robinhood, Stash, Acorns, Betterment, etc.) allow free ACH. I personally have experience with Robinhood making up to 6 ACHs back and forth in a month with not charge. They basically assume the cost because they want it to make it easy for you to keep your balance in your Robinhood account as they earn fed rate interests on your balance.

Could you open an account that allows free ACH transfers and go back and forth with $250? Like for example, Coinbase. You can fund and withdraw with free ACHs.

As a Venezuelan I can confirm this. Mining is a real source of income, paying more than an average monthly wage even with the smallest of setups (less than $25 per month). Additionally, the FX from VEF to USD is highly regulated, illiquid and basically un accesible to most the population, bitcoin (although volatile) is the best way to eliminate your exposure to VEF, a currency that is dying because of the mismanagement of the government and central bank.
