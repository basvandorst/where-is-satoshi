if you have cold storage, you should do the following:
write a custom script what makes xor on each bytes of your privkey file. You can use any binary file for the encoding (e.g. your family photo etc.)
(Take care the zeros in the encoding file, skip them during the xor)
Make 3 copies on 3  pendrive of your encoded privkey file
Go to 3 different banks and put it in the vault.
@_date: 2017-02-15 10:20:47
you forgot to count the block reward, and transaction fees

Let the Bitcoin blockchain intact. Do not change to SW-LN.
Instead, use p2p node-piles based on the improved local wifi-routers (located at the providers). The cutomers may keep their savings on the Bitcoin blockchain, the often spent amount placed to the many of local nodes. (there is need a local accounting protocol, on the wifi routers)
IMHO this is the only rational way to distribute the enormous transaction load.

The Bitcoin-spoiler BU-SW sabotage alliance feel enough strength to start the coup. Before that they accuse the chineese miners. Typical.

The miners feel they would be forced into the Segwit-corral.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:16:03
The advantage the own miner version: There is no need to upgrade. Once it was made well, it will works. 
@_date: 2017-03-30 21:36:29
Actually, the miners want to stay at the pole, and the Segwit party wants to commit a nasty thing. Basically the major miners are the cool headed, for self-interest.
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:10:01
The UASF is like the communism. There are the capital-owners (miners) and are the proletars (nodes).
The communist/UASF ideologists try to do believe with the majority, they are the rule-makers. The result is cathastrophe.

@_date: 2017-03-21 20:30:35
1. negative thinking
2. The transaction malleability-fixing is a subterfuge to establish the Segwit-regime.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:33:39
The hashpower will determine, who control the blockchain. That is evident. Any other attempt is utopia.
@_date: 2017-03-29 22:10:19
This definition seems to me an post-created, artifical thing, an attemt to bypass the original Satoshi concept about the hashpower superiority
@_date: 2017-02-06 13:32:36
The BU-SW cummulated hashrate almost 50%
Bobby Lee said earlier, lets make a hardfork first.
Both of the protocols are the same reason: Bitcoin-methamorphosys for the controll.
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:19:04
Sorry I dont get it.
I see the nodes as technical instrument to relay the buy/sell messages. The investors are the terminal points. They will choose the stronger, safest currency -the very one with stronger hash-power behind. (there is an additional fact, that the financial majority of the bitcoin investors are chinese)
@_date: 2017-03-04 20:43:12
The investors too.
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:12:58

That is deuce. Savings must be inflated, since the people's work gradually inflated by the time.

@_date: 2017-03-13 11:40:19
Nodes in favour of Code. Satoshi's original concept: Pow decides instead of the IP address.
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:38:01
Because the most of the users simply install the Core with higher version number. They didnt care, there is an Alien's egg inside. The correct way would if Core releases twin Core-version, SW and non-SW
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:52:07
...after shaolinfry start to stirring.
@_date: 2017-03-14 11:01:17
That is a sneaky thing if core releases the upcoming release with sw support and said the users choice segwit. They simply choice the latest software, not segwit, what is a metamorphosis.
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:18:50
@_date: 2016-03-11 09:50:24
maybe the time could be altered on the server?
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:13:00
In this case, the customer have to be the ability to decide which kind of coin will purchase. Unsafe SW, or the original. Need to upgrade the client program (for example, the Mycellium what I use)
@_date: 2017-03-04 12:40:55
UASF is the "B" plan to the spoiling the Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:06:28
This miners-blamed propaganda similar to the communist propaganda against the small land-owners (farmers) in the Eastern Block. Thy were named as "kulak" and were described as public enemies. They were wiped out and their land was joined in argicultural communes.
The miners are in the way of the SegWit-communists.
@_date: 2017-03-04 13:19:44
The hashpower (workpower) decides not McNodes.
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:15:00
The whole debate is according to the Bilderberg wish, creating a schism, making the potentially dangerous Bitcoin to a lightweight treat.
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:04:47
The bitcoin is not toy for the geeks anymore, it is an asset from now.
@_date: 2017-03-04 23:39:59
The customers might vote, which currency will be favorable. The client program would ensure the availablity of the customer's choice.
@_date: 2017-03-30 13:00:27
seeking the seat.
@_date: 2017-03-06 17:51:18
So, we lost the race with the chineese miners,  let change the rules?
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:06:31
Inversely, the constant mining version with the major hashpower could be commercial, the other for the geeks, and developers.
@_date: 2017-03-25 23:50:18
That must be a strategy, lies crying in choir. There was no problem until the forced segwit plan.
@_date: 2017-03-29 23:43:04
The nodes easily can be multiplied, while the hashpower cant, so the hashpower is the etalon. The nodes important part of the Bitcoin network, but not in decision making.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:14:04
...And the BU developers somewhere will got an "irrecusable offer", and they will develop the BU-SW version, a soft fork over the hard fork.
The miners must develop an own version perhaps on the Core 0.12 as base point, and support an own node-network.
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:52:49
The chain with stronger haspower will be safer then the others. The forkish-party need to change the PoW algoritm either. 
@_date: 2016-06-03 23:05:58
My advice: 
@_date: 2017-01-19 21:47:54
those guys want to choke Bitcoin most.
@_date: 2016-06-21 13:25:15
CW only a tool, they trying to take back the control from the    chineese miners, with the help of law.
@_date: 2016-12-03 18:32:31
The BTCC formally betrayed the chineese kartell, that is the reason of the relatively high figure.
To enforce the sw adoptation the Core can do 2 things, discount the adoptation level and planning the future developments on the SW-plaform only. Do able the chineese start a reliable core-fork?
@_date: 2016-12-01 07:45:04
imho the sw-alliance tried to pesuade the BW to switch from 8M to sw. (The harsh statement of the BW about the missing but required hard fork before the sw soft fork)
With the join of the BW, and the Unlimited party, hash power of the sw alliance may exceed the 50%
Samson Mow sw-activity is a great surprise anyway
@_date: 2016-11-13 16:30:13
Trump wont let it
@_date: 2016-11-27 18:27:40
That is systematical, they don't want to see a deflational currency in the ecosystem where the controlled inflation is essential.

@_date: 2016-12-02 07:55:47
yeah, so would be bigger playground for the spammers
@_date: 2016-12-02 08:13:26
The problem will be the same, only the figures will be bigger. The real customers always need to pay appropriate fees if they want to submit transactions.
@_date: 2016-12-18 12:35:20
If they want to get bigger, start a new blockchain, do not spoil the original. The biggest value of the Bitcoin is the blockchain.
@_date: 2016-12-17 13:05:01
They failed to take over the segwit, so he calls for a hardfork to join the forces with all of the unlimited, classics, segwit guys. If they persuade the bw pool about the hardfork, they can reach the 50% and step over the chineese alliance. This means that the original blockchain structure will be spoiled. Bobby Lee, and his guy, Samson Mow are the cuckoo eggs in the bitcoin nest.
@_date: 2016-12-18 14:47:49
A technology improvement is exponential (17% growth always calculated from the last basepoint) a growing of the blockchain is linear.
@_date: 2016-12-02 08:23:41
imho the HF is not desirable, in the light of the ETC-misery. SW seems too difficult and not predictable. This is a working system, any major implementation is risky.
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:37:29
Threat to what? The Blockstram future plans maybe.
@_date: 2017-04-07 14:18:37
Coup means: change the status quo. In Bitcoin world initiate an contentious fork. The Segwit accept-level hardly reach 30%.
My opinion, the Blockstream wants to seem to be clear-handed. But they want the Segwit get through. The result is the present.
@_date: 2017-04-07 22:34:44
Most of the node operators simply install the latest Core software automatically, because that is the latest. Of course, a lot of them support the Segwit either. They will show their opinion if they sign the uacomment, at least symbolically.

Dear troll harder, Those are who installed the latest Core software. That is all.
The really segwit supporters are above, those who signed the uacomment. (hard 2.6% currently)
The official segwit support (by miners) about 30%
@_date: 2017-04-21 08:33:55
Segwit and malleabiliy fix is two different thing. The Segwit pushing the Bitcoin toward a toy of the Core. And this will the last nail in the coffin the Bitcon as communitiy software. The nex step will stop the availability the open source code, only binaries will be available.
@_date: 2017-04-21 07:21:10
Segwit is a multistep way to convert Bitcoin from a deflational currency to digital FIAT money. Create one from the only one.
@_date: 2017-04-29 15:47:50
When will be available on gcc?
@_date: 2017-04-07 16:38:42
Yeah, lets build your rig
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:19:42
I hope it will be same in the future. I would not like to see a new emerging Microsoft2. 
The Segwit itself has unjustified difficulty. Additionally, irreversibe.
Too much price. I understand there are a lot of extra software enginieering capacity, but the Bitcoin is a deflational storage device, not a commercial product. Must keep it simple and efficient.

The node operators are the passengers, the miners are the pilots, the developers are who develop the airplain.
@_date: 2017-04-21 09:25:44
Nothing technical: The Blockstream is a company. Never let a company to convert a system on his own. There are 2 different thing, the software and blockchain data. If the Blockstream (self-proclaimed Bitcoin developer) develop a software that is OK, but if makes the the blockchain inconsistent that is not welcomed. With Segwit they went too far.
Edit:Blockstream instead of Core

A desperate attempt to take control over the Bitcoin by the authorities
@_date: 2017-04-13 10:46:04
The interest of the developer companies, and mining companies entirely different.
The developer companies want to grow, or at least exist, they want profit, need to pay salaries etc. so they always must make something new.
The miners are opposite, they want a simple, safe-working  bitcoin software without overdifficulty, backdors, attack vectors etc. If they got it (or make it by themself) it will work forever (or at least while will be electricity). There will need the software writers no more, this is neither Microsoft Windows nor Office, with new versions. The bitcoin software is a special, written for a very one aim, no need user features.
@_date: 2016-02-19 23:47:56
then must be send through the port 80
@_date: 2017-04-03 12:12:36

Today, the Bitcoin left behind the consequence of the first serious UASF-attempt. Similary effective as Hearn's whiny ragequit.
@_date: 2017-04-07 21:55:27
They are all in the shadow of Sathoshi.
The original conception of the Satoshi-Bitcoin is a simple reliable system. The pratical neccessary changes was made by Anderson and the early Blockstream. Now they try something different in the name of the bigger effitiency. They gains minor capacity increase (fairly not enough comparing the future demands) but the price is an overdifficult code structure. This is a kind of grabbing power: reduce the insiders, build an own system. I bet, after the segwit-coup ther will not be route backward, the original and simple Bitcoin wont exist anymore. Too much price. My opinion, in the future, the capacity increase must stads on the side-chains, not the Bitcoin main-chain.

UASF is full with politics. The Bitcoin is in healthy condition. As csw explained there are hidden slippery features in the SW regime to take control from the miners to the developers. (3 body calculation problem) Actually the miners want the status quo, the core wants take over, fight for the power, meanwhile treats the community as sheeps.

UASF=User Activated Soft Fork
UASF official name is BIP148 (Bitcoin Improvement Protocol, 148th)
The are two main actors in the Bitcoin world, the miners and developers. There is an non-direct fight between them, who rules the Bitcoin system. Due to the original Satoshi concept, the miners are the decision makers. The Blockstream (bunch of developers, with dubious corporate support in the background) try to take the control gradually, with a new protocol called Segwit, in the name of "transaction capacity improvement". The miners dont want it, the Segwit came to a dead end.
Now there is a non-offical Blockstream initiative, the UASF. They lure the node operators (minor actors) to make a fork and try to bypass the miners. Meanwhile they are spraying heavy propaganda, against the (mainly chinese) miners (they are communist, monopoly, etc)
@_date: 2017-05-08 09:46:15
It is possible to do UASF at 6% level?
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:26:44
