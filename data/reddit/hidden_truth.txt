Or reinvest when it drops

Not even that but for sheer novelty value. Even if let's say 30 years from now bitcoin is a dead as dead can be, it's literally part of history at this point and people would want it entirely for that reason.

Maybe they need the 1,000 from him so they can give 2,000 to the bitcoin mining company they found on reddit that offered them 8,700 in returns.

Cost dollar averaging. For example, you buy $100 and it drops significantly, you buy another $200, then it goes up and you sell off your $100 position at a profit.
It goes down, you buy more shares. It goes up, you sell off your less favorable positions.

What does luck have to do with it? Bitcoin has now smashed through $8,000 like seven times in the past 3 years. Even during the parabolic run there were like 6  retractements of ~30%.

Don't leave it in your house when you move out

So you're hiding the key to your public safe and hoping nobody finds it, instead of both the safe and the key being hidden. The more you describe it the worse it actually sounds

And what about the massive fortune 500 companies utilizing alts?

No. It becomes easier. Sure if one wallet is rigging then it's easy to spot. But if a wide array of wallets are acting in tandem to give the appearance of organic movement then it would be difficult to identify. And even if it was discovered to be the case, so what? What are you going to do about it? Do you think ever in a million years you would see fines against entities for rigging Bitcoin? 
55% of bitcoin is held by 1% of wallets, we don't know if there's overlap in ownership of those wallets, we don't know if that's all of their holdings (probably not), we don't know how many wallets their wealth is spread across. If you don't think the market is heavily controlled, you are foolish.
If I had massive amounts of wealth, Bitcoin would seem like one of the easiest/safest ways to implement predatory practices.

So how are you going to go about regulating 385cR5DM96n1HvBDMzLHPYcw89fZAXULJP and 3Cbq7aT1tY8kMxWLbitaG7yT6bPbKChq64? How are you going to identify them, and how are you going to identify all of the wallets associated with them?
The whole point of Bitcoin is that it's inherently immune to regulation. It's what the lolbertarians have been parroting since its inception.

Yea my message history clearly identifies me as a "Bitcoin believer" (whatever that even means)

Suspicious activity reports are a result of it going mainstream. Everything he mentioned is just best practices when dealing with any institution or entity whatsoever. Police are mainstream but they, too, will take your $5,000 if it's just sitting in your car. Welcome to the real world.

Let me explain how Bitcoin makes you free. With fiat currency ***the richest*** ***1%*** ***held about 38%*** ***of the wealth***. With Bitcoin, however, due to it being decentralize, deflationary, and unregulated, ***the richest*** ***1% only hold 55% of the wealth****.*
