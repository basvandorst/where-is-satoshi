Go to one lawyer, then get a BTC pool going.  Convert to $, pay lawyer, block trademark.  Isn't this pretty simple?  It may cost a lot, but probably not to each donor individually.

My 3x 6870 rig uses less than $2/day in electricity and mines about a bitcoin per day.  I'm not sure if I will recoup the hardware costs on BTC alone (though I hope so), but it's beating out the electricity costs by a large margin.  
Recouping the money will depend on how rapidly the difficulty increases, and whether or not the price of BTC also increases.

Well, it's like if you pooled a lottery.  If you buy 10 tickets (with 9 other people) you're going to have 10x the chance of winning because you now have 10 attempts at hitting the magic numbers, but you split the pot 10 times. 
But some pools also charge a small fee, so a piece goes to the pools owner too (the guy that organized the purchase of the 10 tickets and drove to buy them).

I guess I still don't really understand how the "puzzle solving" part's difficulty is increased.  How is the hash made more difficult at a precise interval?  I didn't really follow the nonce bit with X zeroes.

My rig has its own room so noise and heat aren't an issue.  Thing just runs 24/7 and I don't even check in on it, I just occassionally check to make sure the pool is rewarding me the amount it should be.  For some, theres almost no hassle.

Yes, I think that breathable air is more valuable than a shovel because not having one results in death, and not having the other does not result in death.  Death is the absolute end to everything of value and the ability to value, so I believe that anything that prevents death is of an extremely high value to the things not dying. I disagree with the idea of value objectivism.  I will agree that if no life existed on this planet, then breathable air would not be of value to anything on this planet.  If your definition of intrinsic is that something must have value objective of anything and everything, than nothing can be intrinsic in my opinion.  That's a fair point (if you're making it), but it really only requires that I come up with new definitions.  But I guess that's really what your argument is about (is it?). I don't think you're saying bitcoins are more important than air, just that no one person's definition of value is objectively correct.  Which is fair!
I don't agree with many of the conclusions you have drawn (specifically your comparison of the process people use to value breathable air, and process people use to apply a value to bitcoin), but you made your point thoroughly, and I thank you for that.

This is why I'm currently building a bitcoin based poker site with legitimate security, capital, and insurance (if I can get insurance on something like this).  I'm aiming for full tilt poker quality.  Hopefully my position, identity, and success as a mobile games developer can be leveraged to demonstrate the trust needed for such an endeavor when it comes time to launch.

It was interesting to see them forge biometric thumbprints on Mythbusters, however.  Apparently the technology (at least on the hardware they were using) was not advanced enough to tell the difference between the original thumb and the forged thumb "printout" that they made.

I really like them.  I think it's neat that its that easy to thank someone or donate to something.  It would actually be cool if RES added a bitcoin donate button to every post, and reddit allowed users to put their bitcoin address in their profile.    Rather than just upvoting people, you could actually thank them for all of their help with 0.0001 btc or whatever you wanted to send.

How is this only $5.99?  I was going to jump all over it, but it seems like its priced as an impulse buy, which makes my skeptic alarms go off.  It's either priced lower than it should be, or only one will ever exist and none will be shipped.

That's the "scary" part.  It's priced in so that 1) No consideration is really made on whether or not to purchase because the price is so low 2) It's not worth hunting him down after the fact  because it's just not worth the time to recover $6 in BTC.
I hope it's legit though, because that coin is really very nice looking.

What I did for my password safe was combine 3 or 4 of my passwords with a symbol in between.  
So Dog, Cat, Password, 1234 would become Dog!Cat$Password  It was easy to remember, and it ends up being a lot longer password.

If you go to:
You can see how long it took the pool to "win" 50 btc.   Sometimes its 5 minutes, sometimes a few hours.   Then its split across all of the miners per how much work was done.  Only one winner per round, but everyone is in a pool, so the prize goes to the pool.

These are all problems that are currently being considered.   Believe me, security is the top priority on this project.  I'd be interested in hearing how you would prevent hand sharing though.  You can't stop two people on the internet from being on the phone with each other.

It's still profitable for me.  The machine mines about $12 worth of BTC per day on $2 power.  But I figured I'd beat the rush of everyone dumping their machines while people were still buying parts.

Wow, that makes a lot of sense but I had somehow never put that much together.
So, if you create a wallet on a new computer, grab that address, then encrypt the wallet file and throw it on a USB drive and put that in a safety deposit box, you can have people send that address bitcoins and never need to bring the wallet back onto a computer where it could be comprimised...
Would there be any way for someone to ever steal your btc without stealing that physical usb drive and knowing the password to it?

I ended up grabbing 1Password and generated 50 character strings for every password I had.  I made my 1Password password as long as I could possibly remember too.

This calculator, like every calculator I've seen sucks.  This doesn't count power costs, and it doesn't factor the difficulty increases into the equation correctly.

I use to use tiered passwords like this.  But then I found 1Password and thought I'd just spend my time remembering a 20 character nightmare and let it handle every other password of mine (50 characters).

Why did you choose to arbitrarily make the passwords stored 16 characters?  If you're using an app to store them, why not make them 50 (or max)?

Water has value.  Food has value.  Breathable air is highly valuable.   Without these things you will die.  Their value (rather than price) is not dependent on what two people are willing to buy and sell it for on an exchange.   Their value is always life/death.   
Even precious metals/minerals have some inherent value because they are needed to produce processors and other technologies which could be said to be needed (rather than wanted).  Oil has a value, without it the way we have set up our trade/transportation/societies wouldn't work.  Even random things like Helium are valuable because Helium is used in the cooling of medical systems.  Lots of stuff has an intrinsic value, even if that value was not there five hundred years ago.  
Bitcoins have no intrinsic value.  
1. Belonging naturally; essential.

Currently the difficulty seems to increase by 50% every 2 weeks or so.  Currently you can build a system with 3x 6990 that will do about 2GHash/S earning 2 BTC per day, at a cost of about $2/day in electricity.  At the price of $15, that's $30 per day.  If the difficulty increases at the current rate, and the price doesn't increase, then in 2 weeks you will make $15/day, then in 2 more, $7.5, then $3.75, then under 2.  If the price of BTC doesn't increase a lot, then in less than 2-3 months for sure.

Unless they saw (over your shoulder) which letters you were typing in on your keyboard.  Then they just have to try all the 'n', 'a', 'b' variations.  It would also work if they knew your character set by some other means (that I can't think of).  
Though, if you make your password something like "The quick br0wn f0x jump$ 0ver the lazy d0g."  It would probably be incredibly easy to remember and it would be difficult to crack.  I ended up choosing a random 20 character nightmare, however, because it makes me feel better about it.

You'd be surprised by how easy it is to remember 16 characters of nonsense.  I spent about twenty minutes this morning doing just that.  If you break it up into 4 character chunks, and first practice writing those chunks, then typing those chunks. Then combine them into two eight character chunks.  Practice writing those, then typing them.  Then finally combine the whole thing.  In 20 minutes I was able to fully memorize my new password.  And now I'm just logging in and out of my account testing it so that I can further ensure it gets stuck up there in my head.
