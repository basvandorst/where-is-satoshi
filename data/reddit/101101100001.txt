1. Buy a prepaid vanilla visa/mastercard in cash anywhere in US &gt; 
2. Goto [paxful.com]( and open a trade with any of the dozens of traders who accept Vanilla giftcards
3. Receive bitcoin after uploading photo of the card and receipt, the rate is anything from 50 to 95 cents on the dollar depending on time of day, demand from sellers etc
It is an easy way to get started with bitcoin anonymously with small amounts, for larger amounts and better rates you would need to signup to an exchange and undergo KYC/AML probing
edit: Why the downvotes? Is my post not informative? does it not meet some r/bitcoin circlejerk criteria I am unaware about?

Every thread that mentions Russia on reddit always always endsup with someone saying "But but but the US" always. Every single time, you think theres bots written to monitor posts...
For all its faults US and EU states are infinitely nicer place to live than Russia this is from first hand experience of living and extensively travelling thru all 3, I also grew up in 80s USSR and we left in 90s and returned for visits since. There is just no comparison Russia was and remains a special kind of shithole

please allow us traders to restrict trades by country, many/most payment methods are only available in certain countries
99% of my time is wasted and 99% of all the scammers come from countries where payment methods I advertise are not available.
It is highly annoying having your time wasted and coins "locked" away by retards who can not read basic English.

It is basically extortion of bitcoin companies by one individual with too much power (so much for decentralization eh?)

how is any company to get funding now for bitcoin when investors can rightly point out the thing is being run assholes

Satoshi must be spinning in his grave (i presume he is dead)
It took one guy (Satoshi) to give bitcoin to the world, its taking another guy (Theymos) to make the whole bitcoin ecosystem toxic and potentially lead to its demise
edit: downvote away, you are just proving my point that bitcointalk and this subreddit do not have the interest of Bitcoin or Bitcoin users in their heart but continued lining of Theymos's pockets. So much for "decentralization"....
Whole thing is starting to smell like socialism, great in theory while perverted in practice

I have been using bitcoin since 2011 and in that time one thing has become obvious the more bitcoin is used, the more companies, apps, uses for bitcoin appear the healthier and resilient the ecosystem becomes
I want bitcoin to be used by your average Joe on the street and not just a small group of nerds
I want Bitcoin to put fear into Paypal, Visa, Mastercard and other payment companies which have for far too long screwed over users with fees and all sorts of nasty carry on.
I want an electronic version of cash, I think bitcoin is the most interesting innovation of the last decade at a time when the only "innovation" in IT seems to be Facebook/Twitter (sigh), more advertising and tracking by likes of Google (sigh), and more walled gardens (Apple/android) it is refreshing seeing an open platform that reminds me of the early web in the enthusiasm and spirit.

Use paxful.com the admins there are actually nice and listen to us sellers
This is a rather dark move by LBC
@_date: 2015-07-10 16:19:53
Well that depends on whether they send using the default 0.0001 fee now doesnt it? as we have learned in the last few days :(

Damn no vanity plates in Ireland, its always
@_date: 2015-07-08 16:47:08
Dude its hard enough to explain to people how to use bitcoin without having to go into increasing default fee size which many wallets do not give an option for.
Anything which makes Bitcoin harder to use is a negative!
I have 2 tickets today from people asking why there were not credited, had to explain that their transaction was not confirmed in the usual 5-10 minutes and that they have to wait, this makes Bitcoin look bad to people who are just getting started out!
@_date: 2015-07-06 10:35:36
Paypal is "convenient" but you have to tie your credit card + bank account to it and also handover your SSN and upload ID documents.
Coinbase and Circle are identical, ask for identical documents (they have to due to AML/KYC laws) and provide similar service but via bitcoin.
So if you want "convenient" then there are plenty of options, if you want "anonymous" then there is a whole different path to go down to get bitcoin. The best being in person meet via LBC like i done last week :) where i sold large amount of my btc for cash and had a great chat with another fellow nerd

Try to use Paypal for anything more than a few hundred usd/eur (Depending on jurisdiction) and paypal will have to ask you for ID and various documents
It is something like 400 to 2000 euro in EU for example.
This is not a bitcoin problem, but money transmission laws dealing with KYC/AML
Only way around are cash&lt;&gt;bitcoin localbitcoins style meetups or sellers who will accept paypal but everysingle one of them will want to anally examine you due to fraud that comes with paypal.
@_date: 2015-07-08 17:03:20
No it is not performing "brilliantly" I have several users in the last few days who I spent alot of time convincing to switch to bitcoin asking why their transactions are unconfirmed since their clients have a hard-coded default feet and to be honest I rather not waste more time explaining how/why they should be paying more. And why should they?
@_date: 2015-07-04 15:53:44

This alone is a reason not to use it, I still have domains stranded in that gobshites domain registrar (nameterrific) that was first to accept bitcoin
I hear he is now running coinjar in Australia, pitty the fools who use that now
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:23:13
People are more likely to use bitcoin less (hence leading to bitcoin network remaining in obscurity) than pay more fees.
It is already hard to convince people to use bitcoin with so many cons opponents point at, adding another reason (high fees) should not even be on the agenda.
edit: I withdrew 0.9 BTC yesterday  from LBC because i wanted to buy something (Still unconfirmed) then sent back 0.41 few hours later so i can trade more (and this is also unconfirmed due to the first transaction being unconfirmed)
In meantime huge thread on LBC forum with people complaining they can not trade.

Q. What do Visa/Mastercard make of you? what are the chances they will pull the rug from under you?
@_date: 2015-07-06 09:51:27
The problem is not with bitcoin but you wanting to trade legacy crappy payment methods such as credit card which impose all sorts of restrictions and want to analy examine all your transactions in exchange for virtual equivalent of gold. 
Paypal / Visa / Mastercard view Bitcoin as something that can make them obsolete hence THEY put in insane barriers in place in front of you.
Blaming bitcoin for it is like blaming a rape victim for being raped for being too promiscuous
Anyways to answer your question, you might find what you need on localbitcoins, especially doing a cash in person trade. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 11:47:54
The problem is getting coins in and out of LBC today, some of us don't like keeping large amounts in wallet there when my trezor would store btc securely
@_date: 2015-07-08 15:54:03
Quite a lot of new people getting into btc in the last month (I am doing my bit :) explaining and trying to get more people to use it ) but these recent "bumps" are definitely not helping the sales pitch
@_date: 2015-07-07 09:07:06
 
Localbitcoins has ground to a halt today due to transactions not coming in/out, this "DDOS" is having a very real negative effect on the bitcoin ecosystem
Instead of trading on LBC i am twiddling my thumbs for the last day waiting for bitcoin to arrive at LBC

@_date: 2015-11-04 12:44:09
go to localbitcoins put up and advert for amazon giftcards you can get them for 50 cent on dollar average
but 
you risk your amazon account being closed of course, especially if seller charges back
if you have a longtime account it helps with not getting your account closed
thats the risk, the reward is cheap anything on amazon
