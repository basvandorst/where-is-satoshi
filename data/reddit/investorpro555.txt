Unfortunately for you reality doesn't go away just because you hide from it. 
You losing money while hodling like a sheep regardless whether you see my messages or not.

There will be lots of denial posted here but the bubble has burst and it isn't even done bursting yet. Bitcoin graph looks even worse than the .com bubble graph.

Looks like you cashed out nicely. Congrats. Shit is back below $6900. Dead cat bounce confirmed.

If you are up 700% and haven't sold you are a fool.
A fool and his money are soon parted.

I don't get you people that state this. If bottom is 5s then why don't you sell and rebuy at 5s?
I mean a good decision in the equity markets right now would be to buy a PUT option to hedge your downside risk but this isn't an option here unfortunately.

You think I bought bitcoin? LOL buddy I"m too smart to buy into a Ponzi scheme.

past performance doesnt predict future result. Bitcoin never had a true mania phase with massive media attention until 2017. Thus it never had a true blowoff phase. This train is full speed ahead to $0 and nobody can stop it because there is no reason to buy bitcoin when the perception right now is that it will just make you lose money. A company can have fantastic earnings that can change sentiment while bitcoin doesnt have that. People will keep selling to $0 at this rate.
