It dips when I buy in.

Hea töö

Good luck getting an account there now.

Do you want to take a wild guess on how many times this picture has already been posted on this sub?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:56:54
Nice account, nice begging.

You would think that they are able to anticipate this traffic after the previous crashes but I guess not.
@_date: 2017-12-07 23:06:54
At some point there might not be enough buyers to bring the price back up.

Yes your verification through Coinbase is one step and then you need another one on GDAX so you have to have two different documents.
Edit: Estonia
@_date: 2017-12-01 07:27:36
GDAX requires a second document verification (at least for my country?) so people with only one document can't use GDAX..
Is Polniex a good alternative?

Good post except for the fact that the Spanish Inquisition gave a few weeks notice so they weren't that unexpected...

Registered up @ Bitstamp but I have been waiting for a confirmation for 2 weeks now. So can't really say I have got far.

The 8ball has spoken.

A dip to buy from for Christmas, thanks Santa!
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:16:10
I guess two documents is required for outside of US or UK
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:05:06
I hope this post is satire.

I don't know much (or anything, really) about trading but I agree, I would wait for confirmation of a reversal (which we got!).
It is my understanding that the best for trading would be to use the short- and long-term EMAs? For daytrading you should look at the 1 or 5 min graphs?
I don't really plan on daytrading because of the high transaction fees outside GDAX but understanding new things is always interesting :P 
@_date: 2017-11-24 08:33:26
Looks to me like reversal might be hitting soon
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:56:49
90% rise with 1 month..and people keep buying? 
I am greatly interested in what kind of risk analysis someone went through to establish that he/she should buy BTC at this point.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:38:54
Coinhive redirect?
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:26:15
They said it is down for 1-2 hours on twitter...5 hours ago
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:34:14
Coinbase said that they had 8x more traffic than the last traffic peak.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:55:31
Can you elaborate what is wrong with Jaxx? I currently use it to store my mined ZEC, what would be a better alternative (for PC or iOS)?

My hairdresser said that her garbage man said that his brother said bitcoin is definitely going to dip tonight.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:14:03
That house triangle picture was pure gold.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:58:18
Rip Coinbase yet again.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:32:29
You should zoom in. 
 
You can see that there are more sellers than buyers and a support level at 10k 
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:19:37
Can I please get the next Powerball numbers also?
