Hey, thanks for the suggestion! I think this would not work, as it would incentivize people to create as many transactions as possible to try and get the bonus prize. Remember that there are no transaction fees imposed (and we don't want to have mandatory fees) and people can create transactions with themselves. How do you envision mitigating such an attack?

Proof of burn and timelocking are two mechanisms. Identities can also be promoted if they can gain trust from their friends who use the software. I've explained this more thoroughly as an answer [to another question](
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:38:18
We expect the market to start demanding minimum proof-of-burn amounts. In my paper, there is a parameter called "expected proof-of-burn amount", which mathematically describes this. While reputation pledges are optional, it's highly likely that, in future versions, vendors with 0 trust will appear at the bottom of search results, or be filtered out completely, especially once people start using reputation pledges more.
@_date: 2014-06-19 21:02:49
That's a tough problem. While it ultimately comes down mostly to the operational security of the individuals involved (no matter how good our technology is, if people leave their laptops unlocked, there's not much we can do about it), we are aiming to introduce some concepts which may help balance anonymity and reputation.
One of these concepts is the partial topological knowledge in our web-of-trust. While traditional non-anonymous webs-of-trust, such as the GPG graph which is published on keyservers, reveal the whole topology of the graph, we are designing our system so that each node only knows partial information on the web-of-trust. Ideally, we'd want them to only be able to know their local neighbourhood, although this may not always be possible depending on the assumptions on how powerful the attacker is.
We are working on certain mathematical models which will allow deducing indirect trust about nodes far deep in the web-of-trust without directly knowing the topology, through delegation of trust calculation to your direct neighbours, which, in turn, delegate to theirs.
Hiding the topology is a big step towards anonymity. Coupled with hiding the IP of the user through Tor and maintaining a pseudonymous user-friendly identity through namecoin, one can stay completely anonymous.
Furthermore, certain mechanisms to increase reputation exist as side-channels in addition to the web of trust: Proof-of-burn and timelocking. We are currently exploring how these can contribute to the trust model.
@_date: 2014-08-27 20:36:24
Great point. This is why we will use a web-of-trust in addition to proof-of-burn.

OpenBazaar dev here. I agree with you that these betas we're pushing out are Alpha quality. However, we want to keep the community in the loop, receive feedback, and not keep testing in the internal dev cycle only.
We try to follow Eric S. Raymond's "release early, release often" saying, and listening to our users. While we don't think this is a release close to a stable release, we value our users' input and we are very excited to show our work to the community, even though unstable and buggy. The reason we're doing this is because OpenBazaar is just something completely new and our users' feedback is very valuable to us: For example, we figured out a Windows build would be of utter importance to our users through your feedback, and we prioritized it over many other exciting features that we have on our roadmap.
We're hoping to keep reiterating until we reach a more stable version. Beta 3, which will be released in 5 days, fixes many stability issues and network connectivity problems, so that's a big step forward for the back-end. It also introduces several code quality fixes, among others better coverage in our unit tests across the whole codebase, an improved build process, an improved daemon. So it doesn't bring many user-facing features, but rather improves on things that slowly change the quality of our software from alpha to beta (but we're certainly not there yet IMHO).
Thanks for your patience! :)

How do you plan to implement this technically on the bitcoin blockchain?
@_date: 2014-06-21 09:29:58
Thank you very much for your feedback. If you like, we welcome contributors to our project, so you are invited to come discuss on IRC. After we write down some more concrete things about the pseudonymous web-of-trust, things will hopefully become clearer.
The probabilistic normalization only holds for trust claimed by your neighbours for third parties. This is used to limit the amount of trust your neighbours can project onto others by using a simple multiplication rule: Their normalized claimed indirect trust for a third party is multiplied with your direct trust towards them. This way, a sybil attack of a "fan-out effect" is countered, where a neighbour claims they trust a bunch of people highly and then that trust is used to trust a third party, accumulating arbitrary amount of trust on an individual, even though your trust towards one of your friends is limited.
Your mention of GPG is interesting, and you're right that there's a difference between trusting a key and trusting that the key will designate trust towards others correctly. I don't yet know if we'll make this distinction and how.
There are two major differences with GPG:
 * GPG is a web-of-trust which is about identity verification. A signature doesn't indicate trust, it indicates that an identity has been checked. In GPG, I can say I directly trust someone to perform identity verification, but beyond that these levels of trust are not used indirectly. In our network, we'd like trust to propagate at deeper levels. In our case, identities are pseudonymous, so verification is not really that helpful: We don't care much if someone is who he says he is, which he is by definition, as we're talking about pseudonyms. We care if a person is financially reliable.
 * The GPG web-of-trust is typically published on keyservers. We consider this a breach of anonymity when it comes to pseudonymous identities. Graphing the topology of the web can reveal important information about the parties, such as degrees of separation from known entities. We're aiming to create a system which works with partial topological knowledge.
Your ideas sound interesting. I'd like to talk more to you and gain insight from you. Perhaps we can collaborate. Come join us on  and let's have a talk.

Thanks for your question regarding  The Bitcoin OTC web of trust has been a great tool for bitcoin trade and we appreciate their pioneering work in building it. It has the attribute that it really is a web of **trust**, not identity verification (such as, for example, GPG), so it's one of the first practically used *pseudonymous* webs of trust.
While the Bitcoin OTC network is of importance to the bitcoin community, there are some attributes which are undesirable in it. The most significant one of these is its centralization: As I understand it, the OTC web of trust is controlled and maintained on a server running bitcoin-otc.com and by an IRC bot: Whatever the bot and server say, you must trust them. Therefore, while we do trust the maintainers of this web of trust for now, and we appreciate their work, we believe we need to move towards a more decentralized approach, for several reasons.
A decentralized web-of-trust eliminates the single point-of-failure of a centralized setting: For example, what happens if the Bitcoin OTC web-of-trust admins are required by law to manipulate the web-of-trust?
Currently, there are no means to import the  web of trust. The reasons for this are multiple, and most of them are fundamental theoretically rather than just technicalities:
 * Identity ownership on  works by using GPG keys, which typically correspond to real identities, while we will be using a different identity system, which is pseudonymous. While, in principle, GPG can work with anonymous identities, it was never designed with this in mind, and there are some issues with it.
 * The  web of trust has a public topology. This reveals details that may be disastrous to one's anonymity. In our design, we are trying to give each node only partial knowledge about the web-of-trust graph, to ensure no information about friendships on the network is leaked, unless explicitly desired.
 * We want identity friendly-names to correspond to OpenBazaar internal identities (GUIDs) through a cryptographically secure way (which will likely be a new Namecoin namespace). Cryptographic proof of user-friendly name ownership in identities is not currently a part of  design.
 *  does not currently have a viable way of fighting spam, denial-of-service, and sybil attacks. These have been, admittedly quite successfully, handled ad hoc by the maintainers, but we want to fight them at a more basic, technical level. For example, we want to incorporate a cost in creating trustworthy identities through proof-of-burn or money timelocks.
 *  is not requiring cryptographic proof that a particular identity is trusting another identity through a digital signature. If we imported the network, we'd have to take the maintainers' word for it. This will be hard, as we are planning to allow each node to independently verify signatures on trust edges.
These reasons make it hard to import the  web of trust. However, I will be contacting the maintainers and discussing with them the possibility to do it. I understand there's a lot of value in that network for the Bitcoin community and I would love to look into the possibility of importing their web of trust to our platform, if that's at all possible. Unfortunately, I believe given the incompatibilities in our requirements, this will be rather challenging.

I'll include a mathematical proof in an upcoming paper that these are good proof-of-burn addresses. However, we'll probably be switching to OP_RETURN scripts based on feedback by the bitcoin team. Please give us a few weeks :)

It is encrypted, but not secure yet. While the code is there to enable database encryption (which was implemented very recently), the passphrases are hard-coded. We will resolve this issue in the next beta. For the time being, make sure you don't use your store for anything other than testing!
@_date: 2014-06-19 22:11:15
While we have some concrete ideas about our pseudonymous web-of-trust system, we are not yet sure about how to validate feedback and guard against sybil attacks. One mechanism is to only count transactions that are one-to-one associated with some proof-of-burn. However, a complete pseudonymous web-of-trust can replace a feedback mechanism which is simply based on transaction validation, at least for the numeric part of the feedback (positive/negative).
We are still looking into how to have textual feedback which is not sybil-attackable.

(1) Perform a 2-of-2 transaction to the OpenBazaar fund; we'll be happy to GPG-sign that we'll release it as bounty to the implementer
(2) Use bountysource.com
While we appreciate your effort in funding us through these options, I'd like to **warn users to be very cautious about donating money to third parties who are promising to give it out as donation** if there are no self-enforcing assurances or at least public statements digitally signed by well-trusted parties.
While we expect good faith from everyone, posts such as this can also be used by scammers to promote fraudulent causes. The author of this bounty is a 4-day-old account, so I'd like to give to all readers the following two warnings:
(1) If you're a developer, please don't trust that you'll be paid 4BTC if you do this implementation. There simply is no way to tell.
(2) If you want to donate, please don't use the above address. The OpenBazaar project has its own donation address.
If you want to support Freenet/OpenBazaar integration, please use Bountysource or donate directly to the OpenBazaar project and include a note with your donation.
Thanks again and please stay safe!

OpenBazaar Reputation pledges developer here.
We use a property called near-collision resistance of the SHA256 hash function. Here's how it works technically:
1. Take the public ECDSA key of the OpenBazaar node.
2. Apply RIPEMD160.SHA256 to it. This is your GUID to which you control your private keys.
3. Perturbate this result by modifying certain bits in a deterministic manner. It's important that the number of bits modified is small, but non-zero.
4. Apply SHA256.SHA256 on the result, take the first 4 bytes, and append them to the perturbated hash as checksum.
5. Apply base58 to generate a valid bitcoin address.
The important step is (3). If near-collision resistance holds, which is strongly supported by cryptographic mathematical arguments, we can be sure that this constitutes a proof-of-burn, i.e. that noone has and noone can ever recover the corresponding private keys.
Here is the precise mathematical requirement:
Given a cryptographically secure hash function H, it's not possible for a conventional polynomially-bound agent to find x, y, x', y' such that H(x) = y, H(x') = y', and y' is a perturbation of y i.e. the count of 1's in the binary representation of y ⊕ y' is below some threshold integer ε (but non-zero), where either H = SHA256 or H = RIPEMD160 (either of them suffices).

Oh, I'm sorry. I will remove this post. Do you know what the right place for these is?
@_date: 2014-06-20 00:19:09
Thanks for the suggestion! We are considering proof-of-donation and this is a nice idea. One of the problems with proof-of-donation is that if one controls the address that is used for donations, they can gain arbitrary trust by cycling money back-and-forth themselves.
While we understand that people like us and trust us, we want to develop a robust system which is not susceptible to such problems. One issue, for example, could be the case where developers, who have control over the donation address, are required by law to hand over the private keys to law enforcement, potentially in a secret court order. This introduces a single point-of-failure in the system.
If you have suggestions on how to avoid such an issue, we're very willing to listen :)

Thanks for your feedback.
We're considering web-of-trust and identity interconnection with OTC, reddit, and other platforms, for users whose threat model does not include centralized authorities.
Some of the reasons the integration with OTC is hard are detailed in my paper, but they can be summed up as follows:
* Trust edges on OTC are not digitally signed
* Trust recovery is performed over plaintext (IRC or HTTP)
* It depends on the honesty of the OTC operator
We will be working with the OTC operators to see if we can at least resolve problem  before we're able to interconnect OTC with OpenBazaar in some meaningful way.
@_date: 2014-09-23 08:22:43
OP_RETURN is well supported now. The only reason we used standard transactions was that existing libraries (pybitcointools) and protocols (e.g. Obelisk) make it much easier to build and transmit standard transactions, so it was easier to implement for the first beta, and this makes for easier security auditing as well.
Although really by the time we reach a stable version, there's no reason not to switch, and I plan to do that. The reasons for the switch are:
 * Stop polluting the utxo set as the bitcoin developers have advised me.
 * No rolling our own crypto.
 * Easier for the public to verify that the addresses really are burn addresses (e.g. through blockchain.info)

I'll try to answer the sockpuppets question. This is one of the challenging problems. When it comes to sockpuppets and trust, we have the following mechanisms of avoiding "sybil attacks" on the web-of-trust. The attack happens if one person is creating many accounts and voting for themselves to gain trust. This could happen, for example, on the old SilkRoad where people could give themselves positive reviews through different accounts (which was guarded against through some centralization as well as transaction fees), or on the  web of trust where there is some notion of "global reputation" (although people are careful there to monitor who links to whom).
Here's what we plan to do:
 * Introduce an optional artificial cost for identity creation. This cost may be chosen by the user from 0 up to any arbitrary amount and will have two different forms: Proof-of-burn and money timelocking. In the proof-of-burn case, the creation of an identity is tied to the burning (i.e. provable destruction) of bitcoin which corresponds only to the particular identity. In the timelocking case, you will be required to make a particular sum of money unavailable to yourself for a certain timeframe during which your identity remains valid - but you are able to redeem the money once that timeframe passes. Again this is tied to a particular identity. In both cases, the amount burned or timelocked is publicly visible, and in the timelocking case, the duration of the lock is publicly visible. These parameters can be used internally by the software to determine how trustworthy a particular individual is.
 * The web-of-trust will only work on the trust graph induced with the current user as a source. This means that we're only considering paths that start from the user and end up on the party she wants to transact with. That way, if someone creates arbitrary identities that vote themselves highly, they won't have any effect on the trust, as they are not part of a path starting from the user and ending up on the third party.
 * We will treat trust as a probability measure such that certain (simple) mathematical properties are maintained. In particular, trust will be normalized (i.e. the sum of the trust you give adds up to 1) and within probability range (each trust edge weight is a number from 0 to 1). By maintaining this simple attribute, we can deal with trust as a multiplicative property and therefore limit the trust given from each path to the direct trust given to a user. I'm working on the math behind this to see if I can get some byzantine-network results of correctness under certain assumptions.
 * Introduce an optional artificial cost for each transaction. That way, each trust edge can be validated through proof-of-burn.
This guards against certain sockpuppet attempts under certain assumptions. For example, we will be assuming that a sybil attacker is not able to create sockpuppets across a complete graph separator between the user and the target (otherwise they can get full trust trivially). This same web-of-trust can also be used as one of the vectors against spam, similar to how Freenet deals with it.

I am the original author of this article. I wrote the article the previous day, it was edited by one of my colleagues, and we published it on April Fool's day. This is a prank article and not a true situation - it's fiction.
Eleutherotypia is a popular Greek newspaper. Their official website lives on "enet.gr", and they had not registered eleutherotypia.gr. So, I registered the name a couple of days prior to the prank and made it a proxy to the original website (to make it look legitimate), while I made it serve one additional individual article about bitcoin stealing. We also had a quick chat with the lead software engineer behind the official enet.gr site who commented on our prank as "nice work :)" but without involving the official website at all.
The article talks about my friend and colleague [Petros Angelatos]( (follow him, he's awesome!), who was also aware of the prank. His sister was also aware of the prank and we all played along. The domain name trick made a lot of people fall for it and we all received several messages and calls with worried people. Petros is fine, he was not involved with cocaine, he has never been to Thailand, he wasn't arrested, and he didn't play with Thai girls - but maybe he would have enjoyed that last part!
Both Petros and I are professionally involved with software security (I worked in the Twitter product security team last year). The true parts of the article is that he's an electrical and computer engineering student at the [National Technical University of Athens]( as [am I]( (follow me on Twitter too, I often post about bitcoin and security). His company is [RuleMotion]( as is mentioned in the article, and one of their products is [resin.io]( (it's awesome, check it out). We also both organized a [security seminar]( together one month ago in Greece with more than 200 participants - we want to make sure the world wide web is a safe place for all of us and we believe educating web developers and software professionals is an important part of that.
We are both also big supporters of bitcoin. I'm doing my [dissertation on bitcoin-related research]( and we are both heavy users. We don't like stealing bitcoins and we hate malware as much as everybody :)
The article was picked up by other greek media sites who also fell for it and it was circulated on several greek blogs.
We added a banner saying it's an April Fool's joke during the evening of the same day and on April 2nd we took the site down. We hope you had a good laugh and please don't take April Fool's articles too seriously :)

Do you want to use testnet for multisig or for reputation pledges purposes? Testnet is currently hard to use for reputation pledges, because our only access to the blockchain is through pybitcointools at the moment which doesn't support testnet (and not obelisk, which was our original plan). For multisig, we use obelisk, but we have been having issues with the obelisk protocol, so using the testnet is going to be tough.
I recommend using small amounts on mainnet for testing (&lt;0.2mBTC).

This is possible to do with one [MAD]( (mutually-assured destruction) transaction per piece. While MAD may or may not work well for larger-scale transactions (such as in [OpenBazaar]( this is a great application for it.
I'm not sure whether MAD was ever implemented before over the bitcoin blockchain, but it has been implemented in a centralized way in [NASHX]( In this post I'll explain how you can implement this in a completely decentralized way using bitcoin. I'm not completely sure this will work, so comments, criticism, and corrections are welcome. Some of these ideas came to mind in the recent [Zürich bitcoin meetup]( while others came to mind when talking about this privately with gubatron (OP).
To begin with, let's assume that you only want to pay the seeder and not the miner or the content creator. We'll talk about including them later.
Assume we have two agents, Alice and Bob, who want to exchange a song or some other content. Alice has a piece of the song (or potentially the whole song), while Bob wants to receive this piece of the song. Bob is willing to pay some amount for this piece, let's say for argument's sake 1 [satoshi]( and Alice agrees to get paid that amount. This agreement can be done in a side-channel, which has to be authenticated, as it will include bitcoin addresses.
Once the agreement is made, the parties will follow the MAD protocol. A high-level timeline of the protocol is this:
1. Alice commits satoshi to a locked box.
2. Bob commits 2 satoshis to the same locked box. This happens atomically together with 
3. Once both of these satoshis have been committed, Alice sends the piece to Bob.
4. Once Bob has received and verified the piece, he finalizes the transaction.
5. Upon finalization, Alice receives 2 satoshis.
6. Upon finalization, Bob receives 1 satoshi.
At the end of the protocol, Alice has been paid 1 satoshi, and Bob has received the piece. The reason why Alice has to pay 1 satoshi and Bob has to pay 2 satoshis at the beginning of the protocol is so that they are committed to performing the transaction fairly.
Let's look at the two different scenarios you described in your video to see why the parties are disincentivized to cheat:
Case A: Alice doesn't send the piece. This causes Alice to lose 1 satoshi and Bob to lose 2 satoshis. The money will be [burned]( and so Alice does not want that, as she has made nothing out of it.
Case B: Bob doesn't finalize the transaction. In that case, Bob has received a torrent piece, but has paid 2 satoshis, while Alice has paid 1 satoshi. This is not good for Bob, as he paid 2 satoshis to receive a torrent piece which is really only worth 1 satoshi.
Therefore, both parties will play fair. So it's not necessary to encrypt the torrent pieces or anything, just send them in the clear.
Now, for the technical part of this implementation, we'll work using 2 different bitcoin transactions, one for the "commit" phase and one for the "finalize" phase. I'll go through the protocol from a technical point of view in chronological order. The protocol requires two messages to be exchanged by the transacting parties, one from Bob to Alice (the request), and one from Alice to Bob (the response). The finalization stage simply requires a publication on the blockchain which can even be done at a later time and is not critical for performance.
The technical details are included as a reply to this comment.
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:16:22
**Request stage**
We start with Bob requesting the piece from Alice. During this request, Bob includes two transactions in his message:
1. The (signed-by-Bob) commit transaction
2. The (unsigned) finalize transaction
The commit transaction is a [coinjoin]( or [lighthouse]( transaction in the sense that we have multiple inputs owned by multiple parties. There are two inputs and one output. The 2 inputs of the commit transaction are 1 satoshi from Alice and 2 satoshis from Bob. The one output of the commit transaction is a [p2sh]( to the finalize transaction.
The important point here is that both parties have to sign the commit transaction in order for it to take effect. The atomicity of the commit operation is ensured when both of these signatures are applied and published on the blockchain. For larger amounts, you may require a couple of confirmations, but for torrent-level requirements in performance, Alice probably wants to execute at the moment she receives the fully signed commit transaction. However, if you want extra security, you can make multiple requests, wait for confirmation, and then respond, sacrificing speed.
The finalize transaction is a 2-of-2 [multisig]( transaction requiring a signature from both Alice and Bob. It has a 1 input and 2 outputs. The input of the finalize transaction is the output of the commit transaction. The 2 outputs of the finalize transaction are 1 satoshi to Bob and 2 satoshis to Alice.
The finalize transaction script has to be included in this first protocol message, as Alice needs to verify that the p2sh is valid by hashing the script of the finalize transaction. In this first message, Bob also includes his signature on his commit transaction input.
**Response stage**
Alice receives Bob's message and verifies that the commit transaction has the correct data: Both her key and Bob's key must be included in the inputs. She then hashes the finalize transaction and confirms that the output of the commit transaction matches. She also verifies that Bob's signature is valid on the input of the commit transaction, that the amount outputted from the commit transaction is at minimum 2 satoshis, that her input on the commit transaction is a maximum of 1 satoshi, and that Bob's input on the commit transaction is at minimum 2 satoshis, and that the sum of the inputs is larger or equal to the output amount.
She also confirms that the finalize transaction has the correct data: That the input amount is larger or equal to the sum of the outputs, and that her output is at least 2 satoshis. She also checks that it is a proper 2-of-2 multisig script and that the 2 multisig keys belong to Alice and Bob.
Upon verification of this, Alice signs the commit transaction and the finalize transaction, publishes the fully signed commit transaction on the blockchain, and sends back to Bob the requested torrent piece, the –now fully signed and valid– commit transaction, and the half-signed finalize transaction.
**Finalization stage**
Bob receives the torrent piece and checks its hash against the torrent Merkle tree for validity. Once he confirms that the piece is valid, he signs the finalize transaction. At this stage, the finalize transaction has two signatures, so Bob publishes it on the blockchain. Upon publication, all payments are made and the security deposits are returned to the transacting parties.
This completes the technical details of the protocol implementation using bitcoin.
Keep in mind that you can bundle multiple torrent pieces together, and this would probably be better in terms of bitcoin fees. There's nothing that requires the torrent to be paid piece-by-piece. In the above protocol, Bob can easily request 10 or 100 pieces and only finalize once all of them are received.
To add the miner and content creator to this equation, one simply has to modify the finalize transaction and add more outputs. While the parties are not incentivized to do so, they can if they wish, and fair clients should implement this by default. Of course, once someone has a song, they can pirate it, but they can also choose to play fair and compensate the creator. Both the sender and the receiver of a piece can abort the transaction at the first stage if they see that the finalize transaction does not include a pay-out to the content creator or miner. Care must be taken to associate the correct content creator with each content and to verify the percentage amount requested by the content creator.
One alleged problem with MAD is that of extortion: Any party can threaten the other to keep the funds locked, and, from a game-theory point-of-view, the other party would have to comply and agree to a lower output for themselves. However, if the software is coded in a way that does not accept extortion, the transacting parties will be sure that the other party will not attempt it, as it is unlikely that they will succeed in getting any payment at all, and probably will just lose their money. Furthermore, no one is expected to change their own software to be able to accept extortions by others.
Finally, one additional problem may be that Alice, in the above scheme, must have bitcoins in order to seed. This should not be a problem, as Alice has already paid for the song in order to be able to seed it, so she must have some bitcoin wallet already. In any case, it is a requirement for Alice to have some bitcoins in place, as this is needed to ensure she will not back off from the deal, similar to the way Bob needs to pay a little more initially. This also requires that the content creator has some bitcoin available to use as deposit when bootstrapping the scheme.
One last problem is network connectivity issues: If the connection is dropped or the piece is not transmitted correctly, the money is burned. This should not be a problem. While transaction reversibility comes to mind, it's not necessary to build such complicated features into the node: Just assume that you may have to pay a couple of cents more to retrieve a song and you may make a couple of cents less when you're seeding a song, if network difficulties occur. No one will cancel transactions purposefully anyway, so this should be a rare occasion.
Thanks for building this, these are some amazing ideas and I'm looking forward to using it!

We envision this to be a platform which other technologies can be built upon. While GPL preserves open source, we value the ability of code reuse and openness, which is the reason we are considering MIT: More freedom for the software than the license itself. We'd like our code to be reusable by anyone in any setting.
We hope OpenBazaar will become for commerce what the Internet has become for communications. In order for the technology to spread, we want people to use it as much as they'd like, freely. Imagine the TCP/IP protocol and implementation: Would you want to disallow corporations from using it? Clearly not.
One of the reasons MIT is desirable is that it will be possible to reuse code in both a closed-source setting as well as projects that don't use GPL/AGPL and prefer other licenses such as BSD and MIT which are not compatible with GPL and don't want to relicense.
Having said that, for now we are maintaining an AGPL license, but MIT is under consideration.

To illustrate how anything can be sold, here's a scenario of a typical trade: Let's say Alice wants to sell her Android phone for 1BTC and Bob wants to buy it.
First, Alice opens up her OpenBazaar program and clicks on the "Sell" button. She enters some details about her phone, such as a description and price, and uploads some pictures.
Later, Bob opens up his OpenBazaar program and searches for "Android phone". He finds some listings, sees that Alice is trustworthy and is offering a good price, and sends her a message asking about the condition of the phone. Alice responds and Bob clicks on the "Buy" button to make the purchase using Bitcoin.
Alice is notified that the purchase has been made and that the amount of Bitcoin given is correct. She then ships the phone to Bob. When Bob receives the phone, he marks the transaction as completed, and Alice gets paid. Finally, Bob leaves a positive rating for Alice and Alice one for Bob.

Actually I was a BU supporter but now I want to look closer into these issues mentioned and verify their validity. If they are true we have a code and peer review quality problem, and it unfortunately seems systemic.

This is logarithmic scale. It looks quite irrational...

Based on our current knowledge of quantum algorithms, as Bitcoin mining is based on SHA256, [Bitcoin mining can only be improved quadratically]( using Grover's algorithm by a Quantum computer. This is nowhere near an exponential speedup and would pose no serious threat to the currency.
There are other parts of Bitcoin that would have to be upgraded, however.

Humans *think* the machines are keeping them alive as a power source. That doesn't make any sense scientifically speaking, however. You can't use a human as a power source without providing it with much more chemical energy than it is able to produce in heat. And I'd expect the machines would be smart enough to be able to consume chemical energy and convert it to electrical energy without using humans.
Besides, if the machines wanted the humans just for energy, they wouldn't put so much effort into creating the matrix world. Why create a whole world anyway? They could have just drugged the humans with sedatives, fed them with chemicals, and allowed them to produce heat, living like vegetables, with no experiences. But there's so much effort and development that went into creating a realistic matrix world.
The matrix films tell the story from the side of the humans. The humans think they're good at producing energy. They're not. The matrix is a lie. Humans aren't used by machines for energy. They're used for outsourcing human computation. The machines cannot solve some hard computational problems with AI – they're bad at things like face recognition, computer vision, language, translation and creativity. This is why they have created the whole matrix world: When they need to perform some hard computation that requires human computation, they translate the problem into the matrix world. For example, if they have an image or video as an input and want to see if it's the video of a cat or a dog, they show that video to a human (remember the cat in the matrix?) and notice its reaction, translating it back into digital output for their own use. Hence, we are not the machines' batteries... we are the machines' computers.
The only way to be able to achieve this is to have humans live in a good, realistic environment in which their brains have healthily developed and they have been educated by their peers. If the humans are distressed or suspect that the world isn't real, they will not be able to perform these computations efficiently and correctly. This is the very reason that so much effort went into the development of the realism in the matrix world – with the experiences, the pain, and everything that comes with it.

Thanks! Yes, I came up with it myself, but I see in the other comments that actually the Wachowskis had thought about this as an alternative plot but in the end decided not to go for it.

It's not part of the original story, it's a fan interpretation I came up with.
