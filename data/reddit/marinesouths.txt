If you talking about keeping your bitcoin safe you should avoid web based wallets,and third party bitcoin company like coin base ,they are vulnerable to attack especially web based wallet and third party bitcoin provider can be a scam as well ,because they hold your private key (if you don't hold key you ain't in control),you avoid writing your pass phrase on a paper,in case you want to store large bitcoin for a long time you should use ‭‭wallet like armory ,and also use a hardware wallet,if you a tech savvy you try use electrum on tails,to cover you track you can use bitcoin tumbling or helix to create a pseudonymous transaction that can not be linked to you ,hope this help ����

Do you mean private key is the same as the Seed the bitcoin wallet generate or are they two different things entirely ?

Africa is the first place bitcoin can prove itself as a result of hyperinflation,corruption and theft that plague the continent..people would rather have faith in bitcoin than hold fait..developed countries I think are comfortable with there credit card and bitcoin would be given a slim chance to prove itself..
