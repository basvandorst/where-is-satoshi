Cool article, but this is so far away from "plain English".

These aren't technical jargon? 
I was looking forward to a light read - maybe an article I could link to my non-technical friends.  Instead, I found myself nearly beyond my depth, and I am a cryptocurrency enthusiast &amp; professional software engineer.  Who is your intended audience with this?

I got the same error with the coffee shop but it worked for articles.

As someone burned by Mt Gox and then my Android Bitcoin-Wallet crashed or got hacked (I still don't know which), I would call anyone who doesn't use offline storage naive or stupid.

If quantum computers come out, BTC will be worth $0.  Pretty much the internet would break because cryptography as we know it would no longer be effective.

Don't feed the trolls.  Just down vote and move on.

Step 2 - watch like a hawk as the price continues to drop

In the process of doing this now.  The online claim system _very_ user unfriendly.

Don't count those chickens before they hatch.  If we do end up getting some or all of it back, it is indeed a very valuable lesson learned at a small cost.

I hear you. If you end up needed an arbitrator in any system you're probably gonna have a bad time. Bisq's arbitrator must be particularly bad since its just some random volunteer who probably couldn't care less.
I think the seller of crypto incurs more risk than the buyer. As such, if you sell often enough you will inevitably get scammed. All you can do is try to minimize that risk by:
- only using the strictest fiat transfer systems
- sell only in small increments
- sell to only reputable buyers (accounts with tx history and are old enough)

Bisq is good about warning you about which Fiat money services are more prone to chargebacks than others. At the time when I used it, Zelle was preferred since it had the most strict chargeback policy.

I'm trying to figured this out as well.  Seems that most people only care about the current market, in that, Kobayashi will stop dumping BTC to the market and driving price down.  I care about this as someone who had 1+ BTC in MtGox when it went down.
I found [another article]( that says:

Bought my Ledger Nano s on Amazon.  I _think_ these are actually safe to buy second hand since [attestation is performed each time it is plugged in to a computer](

Is there any documentaries out there on this guy and his case? I've been reading these comments like a murder mystery suspense novel.
