Soon, we’ll be paid to keep it!

I live in the Pacific Northwest and after signing up for Kraken I got an email saying Kraken services were not available in my area yet.

They should pay us a fee for the losses we experience because they can't keep their site up. 
Someone tell me more about Kraken.

Look, I don't day trade and I don't give a shit about the "losses" that you "experts" are dismissing. My point is that Coinbase provides a service and they tend to go down every time there is a swing in price. That is a problem they need to resolve. 
Do I seriously expect Coinbase to offer some type of compensation to their user base for these constant down times? No. I play with this market for fun. There is nothing invested that would ruin me if I lost it all. 
Mock me if you want, but the bottom line is that if you offer a service and then don't provide that said service, people are going to be upset. 
Why is this such a difficult concept to grasp?

So true! At least they're not United Airlines. 
Edit: There, their, they're.

That would be a good option too! They need to do something because I'm starting to think this is being ran out of a bathtub on that Camus Prairie.

Well, if you can't sell when the price is dropping then you're going to experience losses. Having a stable site would prevent that.
