You're pretty cool yourself!

Thank you!

I think I might have solved it. It's because the form only allows for alphanumeric entries and many book titles contain punctuation!
Did your entry contain an apostrophe by any chance?

That might be the issue since I've tried testing our on different OS's and browsers and it worked fine. The form is from a third party so I'm not sure if there is a non-JavaScript version.
Any recommendations for a free form collector?

Can you tell me what issue you had with the form?

Thank you :)

I haven't even considered paying my suppliers with Bitcoin. I think very few non-commercial businesses (i.e. B2B)  accept Bitcoin.

I should probably ask, what browser and OS are you using? I received another email from a customer about the form not working so I'm trying to fix the problem now.

They're all in the public domain but we're getting rights to contemporary books as well.

Good idea! But unfortunately Shopify doesn't allow any custom changes to content on their checkout page.

I'm honored to be your first! Thanks for your business and I'm glad the experience was smooth for you.

Thank you for visiting our site! Can you tell me more about blackcoin?

I think merchant adoption *has* to outpace consumer adoption at least in the beginning. It's a wonderful thing that there are more and more better services arising for bitcoin for business owners.
Also, thanks for the compliment!
