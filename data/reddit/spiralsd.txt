You don't have the seed
@_date: 2017-12-17 06:54:53
Why at least 2?

Well, I'm no expert, just talking it out but I think these would be mass produced by a company. 
Could the individual devices be made so that the contents can be verified without revealing the seed? Then only the producer would know the seeds.

Yeah it does. But it also could increase the functionality. Anyway, that's what I was thinking

Yeah, I think neither one needs to know the key. At any time either could exchange it with the manufacturing company and receive btc to the wallet of their choice.

Doesn't that lead to the same abuse we see now in PayPal? I mean, it also adds a trusted 3rd party back into the equation which seems like a big selling point of Bitcoin

They probably see it as more money out of thin air. At least gold will always be a tangible thing. If Bitcoin or a fiat crashes you end up with nothing but paper and a hardware wallet.

You spelled US Dollar reaches all time low against world reserve currency Bitcoin. Trading for only .001BTC per 1000USD

Have your cake and eat it too. They should have a coin that does nothing but fork.

Why couldn't someone like Google decide to increase their search speed from .25 seconds (guess) to .5 seconds and use all that extra processing power to gain a significant percentage of the mining power, even if just temporarily to sway an adoption?

Yes 3 Satoshi. Pays out 20 Satoshi over the course of 20 years.

Yeah, I agree. That's why, in their minds Bitcoin is the same as fiat. Because it's not tangible. The thing they overlook is that while fiat is based on faith in a country to make good, Bitcoin is faith in the accuracy of the ledger. On the network. I think this makes it more trustworthy. Unless someone gains majority in the network.
