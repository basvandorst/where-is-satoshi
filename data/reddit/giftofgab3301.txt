I just made a post to about a foundation working towards creating a reversible male contraceptive that is very close to clinical trials. They accept bitcoin donations directly!

Hey Sneaky, could you be a little more specific? You say that the money is in your Coinbase USD wallet but is still pending? Are you unable to make purchases at the moment? If you can make purchases, it might just be a bug.

High volume and large transaction fees are making BTC transactions very competitive. BTC can only handle 3 transactions per second, so if there are hundreds of thousands of transactions hitting the network it may take longer to confirm transactions with lower TX fees. Your TX fees act as a "confirmation priority" The larger your fee, the sooner your transaction is confirmed. If you set a 100sat/byte TX fee it wont be processed until all transactions with 200sat/byte, 300sat/byte, 400sat/byte, etc., fees are handled. Hope this helped

I am curious how this will affect the US Government's view on Bitcoin. At the moment, the government doesn't classify Bitcoin as a currency. Wouldn't they have to reclassify Bitcoin as a currency before this could be applicable?

I am going to assume that it has only been a few days since you made the transfer to Coinbase. Keep in mind that Coinbase takes 7 days (they claim 4 business days) to verify a deposit and credit your account. Your bank may have already processed the transaction but Coinbase is still handling things on their side. Give it a few more days and understand that the transfers don't happen instantaneously. Hope this helps!

Not to be rude, but that's why I asked this question... I did some quick googling but I didn't find any exchanges I felt had any real support.

Is anyone using a decentralized Cryptocurrency exchange? Are there any that are even worth looking into yet?

Although we have been "stuck" under 19K and hovering around 17K for the past several days, remember that even just recently as of October 13-October 29 there were no significant gains or losses either. This is a temporary stall as we build support for the next jump and wait for CME futures to open on December 18th

Ripple will be added to Coinbase causing a huge spike in value and fixing it to USD directly, not just through BTC.

If you are going to take advantage of GDAX for it's free transfers, I would suggest cutting out Coinbase altogether. Taker fees are orders of magnitude smaller on GDAX (0.25% compared to upwards of 4.99%).
To answer your question though, when you sell on GDAX the USD is deposited into your GDAX account, not the Coinbase account.

Coinbase announced that they will be adding more Cryptos to their marketplace in 2018. Considering the current adoption of Ripple in the business space and it being in the top 5 coins by market value it is very possible this is one of their considerations.

More people need to be informed about this. Every one was so concerned about insider trading with the GDAX BCash fiasco but didn't even consider bit trading as a likely cause.

Interesting idea but this Crypto assumes that all activities will be able to be monitored. What is stopping someone from opening a contract with Nike to go on a run and all they do is set up a GPS spoof to fake their "2 mile route" from the comfort of their couch? Great idea because it acts very much like a worker's relationship with their employer however there isn't any clear way to verify actual work done. I have a hard time seeing this go anywhere.

I like to think it will be between BTC/LTC. Seems like a match made in heaven considering their history.

Just jumping onto a top comment here... What if BTC becomes so valuable that 0.000,000,001 BTC is worth more than a conveniently usable value, say $100? I can't easily buy a coffee with that. Will we need to deal in multiple smaller value cryptos or will BTC be able to trade in smaller denominations (0.000,000...000,001)? I feel like I know the answer is that it can't be traded in smaller increments but I am unsure. Anyone smarter than me that could shed some light would be very appreciated!
