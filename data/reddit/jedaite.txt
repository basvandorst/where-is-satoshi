Fuck off outta here. This is a bullshit reply that makes me puke. Shut the fuck up and fuck off with this crap. When you retards closed my account, you also offered no actual explanation as to why. Just your so called T&amp;C. What is funny was that you even pointed me to the WRONG T&amp;C that would actually put me in a position of power, as to challenge your reasoning for the account closure. Damn idiots.

Thanks for the recommendation. Revolut are well known for freezing money and I do move a lot of it around. I need EMI recommendations like ePayments, Mistertango and the likes. If you know one besides those 2, please let me know.

Wow, in Romania an MRI is like $130 at a private clinic. $10K for 6 MRIs is like ~$1500 per one MRI. Jesus Christ!!!!!
