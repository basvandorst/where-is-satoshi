Lol, not negative pressure suck, just stuff falling sucks...

Never stopped. I hold. And like everything, they go up, they go down. Then up and so on and so on.

Gravity sucks. But is necessary. I've worked with stocks for decades. Nothing to see here. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:03:12
I bought $200 at 19k. Only because I just get tired of winning.  But I'm rested up now.

There is no law against politicians breaking laws. None they enforce anyways. Hell, FBI can "leak" confidential info to the press these days. Worst punishment is a nice early pension package. 
@_date: 2018-03-13 19:57:11
It was only a couple hundred bucks. I had bought it at 7k, 10k, 14k, and the last at bit at 19k. Sold half at 11k on the way down to break even, then bought back at the 6k dip. So, sanity saved... for now. :)

Coinbase is by far my choice. Why? They work with the IRS, keeping the sight and community relatively legit, they are slow as they keep most assets off line, They are costly as they are also INSURED. I will gladly pay for that piece of mind.

Nothing on btc, just "a good time to buy stocks" after yesterday's fall... go figure. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:34:31
"There is no good or bad, thinking makes it so." I wonder what Shakespeare's though on btc would be right now... to buy or not to buy" THAT is the question. A thousand slings and arrows..... 
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:34:09
A correction can go both ways. In political correct terms, btc is a bi-correctional transviable asset. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:24:14
Yeah, I learned... all makes sense now. Thx

Wallets are simply a coffee can type storage for your coins. Banks pay interest on your cash only when they can loan it or invest it to make them more money and give you a little slice. I do believe that "staking" coins will work in a similar way when that becomes a thing. But like investment accounts, it will be "tied up" and not readily accessible like a current private wallet/coffee can.

Yup. Everyoneone bought gpu's in nov and dec. look what happened. Now the tight arses who kept waiting for one to fall out of the sky can't find one for a decent price. Although they may be falling out of the sky in a month... just the same, they might not... awe, there's the rub.

I invest in everything I can. I take the good with the bad. I have silver and gold locked away, I have stocks, I have certificates, I invest in peer to peer lending. Guess what, it's largely just tying up my cash, which is fine for retirement. But it's not making anything far past inflation. And that is by design. Bitcoin is off the hook right now. And to me, that is just sexy as hell. A slut is fun to party with till she pukes on your foot, then you want to run away.. but sometimes the party is just beginning. We never know until we know

How many million have died, how many wars have been fought, how many children trafficked, how much of the environment molested.  How much.... etc etc... Over dollars. Only was to even connect btc to anythything, is its dollar value. What an idiot.
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:59:10
Oh, I was confused, it had a .02686... btc amount on the second output. What is that for? 
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:24:26
I'm pretty sure coinbase batched my transaction today. "1 input consumed. - 2 outputs created" one of the addresses was not mine.  Was .00002518 fee for both tx. Haven't done much moving coin around. It was a little confusing. But everything went though fine
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:08:01
I moved some coin from coinbase to my wallet today, it said "one input consumed, two outputs created" and they were added together in the transacted amount. One was not mine. Is that batching? Sorry, I haven't been at this long.
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:04:57
Got it. Thanks. I misinterpreted "change" thought you meant "change" .... cheers
@_date: 2018-02-21 08:47:06
They batched my transaction today 1 input consumed 2 outputs created. Phasing it in I guess.
@_date: 2018-03-13 16:11:30
Oh dear no... it's a seeeecret system. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:23:06
I was just reading up on this as well. I get it now.... my change address. Thanks a million

I withdrew 1/2 of my stash from coinbase at 8.8k. Paid my mining electric bill, and then put the rest back in last night when it bounced off 6k.... net btc in wallet is the same... so there's that.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:17:43
I didn't sell enough on the way down, but I sold enough at 8.8k to buy it back and then some when it bounced off 6k. Net coin going in a positive direction so far. If you are using bitcoin as a tool to grow cash, good luck. If you are using cash to grow btc then it's less self defeating and perceivable acceptable. I suspect we're still in the first qtr of the game. A lot can happen by half time. The btc capitulations are hard to measure as they are spread out and largely based on institutional rejection, propaganda, and now simply - fud. But I am hedging that the accumulated capitulations over the last week are the indicators of an overall capitulation. The crypto community is extremely universal and diverse. Not like a bad quarterly report or corporate scandal can bring it down. Keep in mind, the whales can eat a lot of passive little fish, but a lot of aggressive little fish can eat the whale.

I live my life a 1/4 BTC at a time... :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:41:18
Me too. Spent everything I made when I sold at 8.8k keep the faith.
@_date: 2018-04-28 14:20:48
I followed the buy link on the .com page, and I would suspect most folks would buy the actual BTC once they open an account and look around a little bit. Either way, the Rver dude gets the $10.00 BTC referral whatever you buy. The difference in BTC and BCH is pretty obvious. The only confusion I see is in the other sub which is increasingly irritating. It is literally crystal clear anywhere else. Maybe those referral fees are making some big bucks. Idk.
