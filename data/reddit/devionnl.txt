He's basicly asking "what if the numbers shift?". Answering with "strength in numbers" is not really an answer. BTC is losing dominance fast and can't keep relying on its head start.

Thanks man, this made me laugh. So relatable ��

It's the same company as bitonic and works perfectly in NL. But they don't accept new registrations at the moment.

Aaaaand none of those sites are actual exchanges. Just off-the-shelf buy/sell of coins. Save the insults for when you're actually correct.

Yes, but that article ends with some serious added perspective:
- Most people don't agree with him
- He operates a coin that is in direct competition with bitcoin
- He saying people should go to BCH is hence to be expected

That's an entirely different discussion.
The point is that everywhere they make it look like this a Bitcoin-guy. Someone with knowledge ("CTO") that's no longer backing "his" product. Something like that is huge -- if it were true.
The fact is that he has nothing to do with bitcoin, he's been anti-bitcoin all along. His statements are to be expected. It's like a Mercedes CTO saying "Yeah, BMW sucks". Nobody would care.
For the record; yeah BTC should fix this transaction nonsense... and soon. It is not usable in it's current state for its intended (end goal) use. But, we're still some way from the end goal, so I couldn't care less at the moment.
/edit: cleared up last statement.

Haha ok... Wait...

Uhm... As an user, fast &amp; cheap actually are requirements. And I'm guessing I'm not the only one. Not sure where/what BTC wants to be now. At the moment I'm only using it as a speculation device, anything else is just not possible.

Serious question: why is BCH not a nice alternative? (Disregard the religion-sect-like "followers". I'm only looking at tech here.) I've done my research and pure on tech based arguments they currently have the upper hand. At least from my (again, tech only) perspective.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:36:54
He never mentioned an exchange. You all need to read his post more carefully.

Thanks for filling the gaps. Have my upvote.

Older article making the same mistake: 
Several people have been sending me texts already. The FUD is real. The smear campaigns are working. 
The worst thing is the media has no clue about what they're writing.

He's not wrong in addressing the issues Bitcoin is currently having. I don't think anyone here is denying those issues.
The point I'm trying to make is that media (maybe malice, hopefully just ignorance) is misinforming the public.
The article is presented as "BMW CTO says BMW is doomed" (which would be exceptional news), but instead it's just a Mercedes CTO who's making comments about a competitor (while still making a point, it's a far cry from a project owner to abondon ship).
I think the most important cause here is that this Mercedes CTO owns the BMW.com domain, creating massive confusion.
(If anyone is going to make this an argument about which car is first or better I will find you and smack you over the head with a bag of hardware wallets)

I get the argument against huge blocks, but... As long as blocksize (if it's only that) increases at the same rate related technology does (storage, bandwidth), what's the problem? If it's scalable, which is doable, it sounds like a solution to me. What am I missing?
