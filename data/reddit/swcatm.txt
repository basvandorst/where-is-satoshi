From what I understand and correct me if wrong but by time QC really takes off, most of network infrastructure should be fibre optics. Therefore the very act of observing the data (photons) will corrupt it and should be obvious there's been a breach. Thats for middle-man attacks but brute forcing passwords is obviously a different ball game... 
Guess we have to rely on tech catching up as its developed.

Being intelligent doesn't mean having the vision or being able to see the big picture unfortunately. Scientists are a great example of this having their own specific field of study, focussing solely on that and not putting the peices of the rest of the puzzle together or really talking to each other at all.
They're 'intelligent' on paper but what use is intelligence without good vision?

I'm constantly talking to the average Joe Bloggs and the first thing I ask when approached about this is 'do you know how the current banking system works or what fractional reserve means?' 99% i get the 5 mile stare which means 'no' (and doesn't want to either.)

He's right. Quantum computing could break all types of current encryption within the next ten years.

They are already....

Ah gotcha. Sorry misunderstood at first but you mean like a ticker? No probs good idea.

Well yes and no if that makes sense. Once they're setup it's fairly straight forward but you need to be available just incase of any issues or customer queries. You need to be able to manage your time properly, it's a bit like being on call 7 days a week.

Guy cant see the bigger picture and is blinkered by his own comfort. But thats ok he'll feel the pinch when he gotta weigh his cash instead of counting it lol

First you have to understand our current financial system. Then get your head around the bitcoin tech. Then philosofise value and role of money in society. Then look past the prices and the get rich quick mentality and then and only then does the penny truly drop

I WANT ONE

Sad that we need things like this to help explain to general public but it's sooo necessary right now. People are dumbed out these days, this is almost insulting their intelligence by showing them this. I'll look forward to using it. Probably tomorrow :)

Already got two looking to expand in new year so I'm happy to be part of this.

Don't get me started about FB. As a B-ATM business I've been jumping through hoops for months now. First they allowed me advertising, then not. Then asked me to verify my domain, then answer a questionarre. Now nothing. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 17:18:15
I've reached this conclusion too! Nobody gets bitcoin on FB, most still think it's a company and incapable of sidestepping their current prejudice.
@_date: 2018-12-19 19:02:08
Actually lol'd. Congratulations.

Name and shame.

How in gods name do you call them!? Best I've managed is a messenegr chat with an obvious algorhythm that went round in circles. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 18:57:17
Makes you wanna burn their servers down lol

It seems like they're expecting the price to sky rocket and a tidal wave of incoming capital gains tax, or something.
@_date: 2018-12-21 16:17:14
Amazing!
