Generally web wallets are considered a riskier alternative to hardware/software wallets. They offer more convenience but also offer more risk to expose your seed. Many people advise to not have too much balance on those web wallets and keep more in cold storage/hardware wallets/software wallets.


I don't really get what you are asking for here. Are you asking if the BTC is stored on your computer? It is not? Maybe read the sticky post again?

Of course it works on mobile.

Yes always always back up your private keys. Though if your hdd or ssd is still intact nothing should be lost. It is different because paper wallets don't require computers which have more security flaws than a sheet of paper (apart from physical access).

Then your hardware or laptop breaks... Idk get a new laptop? Or use a computer.

Let's say you bought a $2,000 TV hypothetically in 2013. With $. By your logic you still spent at least $459,000 for a TV.

Somehow you seem obsessed with black people? This seems weird to me.
Anyway, just because some redditor doesn't like/trusts/prefers a certain news website you have to write "personal attack alert" 5 times in a row?
@_date: 2017-09-15 11:19:14
Yeah exactly.

So by that logic everytime the dollar crashes we need to illegalize any exchanges of $. Gotcha.

Then you really might have crappy computer speakers.
