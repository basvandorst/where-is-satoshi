What gives value to bitcoin is consensus of peers on the network.
This is lacking in the current system as proven by the CDO CDS scam.
Their is value in having control over an address and the choice of running a node.

No you are wrong.
The consensus of people with an idea is where it's at.
It has changed the status quo.
This is a powerful thing.
Continue to overthink it though by all means

Most people haven't got a clue.
In her position due diligence is required but bitcoin is a monetary minnow so it's likely her information is second hand.
Time and the resilience of the chain will win in the end and then knowledge of the system will be a requirement. 
Or shtf but I have faith in the faithful.
