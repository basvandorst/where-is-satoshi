In any free market there will be incompetent operators. Exchanges had no pressure to prove trustworthiness.. but they are starting to see wary customers now.


You sneer at the idea of a free market, but all it refers to is voluntary transactions made by many people, trading for their own preferences. The alternative is to force people to do what you want them to do... and that always has horrible outcomes.

Yes, and I doubt it's second page for you, you were just not smart enough to pick it up.


I interpreted "independently funded" to mean funded by government. That's what it usually means. I wholeheartedly withdraw the criticism that came off your comment.


There's a reason why so many people left funds on MtGox. That reason was they were all so used to regulatory bodies looking after them, that they forgot to secure their own money. That's a fault of regulation.


Errrrrr... no. Even if Mark has obeyed all laws, he hasn't behaved morally right. That's where prior customers punish him. Laws in a democracy do not define morality. They are written on behalf of a majority.


You're just a little misguided... What I wrote was easy to comprehend. I said *prior restraint*! Please read it all again. When populations invest in MtGox, even though they've proven their incompetence, it gives them incentive to keep making mistakes firstly because they possibly don't know if they're breaking the law, and secondly customers are still floating in.. buoyed by belief in omniscient regulations. In a world where free markets were the rule rather than the exception, people would be used to looking after their own things. And from that, Mark would be driven by a vastly decreasing customer base to make changes... and limit losses. Instead there was little prior incentive and he was able to blindly continue. See? *Prior restraint!!*

The guy is right. Independent auditors will be paid by exchanges to audit their work, suggest improvements, and apply a seal of approval if granted.
This has happened before. Underwriters Laboratory is funded by manufacturers and their UL seal of approval is placed on good quality gear.

Correct. Another way to say it is: Dictating what medium of exchange (yes that's the word) to use is not dictating value.
Your whole original argument was that governments give currencies value, but that simply isn't true, as I explained in our thought experiment.


Angry again, but this time you're right. They live in countries, where the prevailing currency is now competing with bitcoin. Bitcoin has been adopted by a small percentage of people voluntarily, which makes it much better than the mandated currency.
That's why adoption is slowly happening.


It won't go away, but it certainly will change depending on the strength of bitcoin. So there, governments can force prices to be displayed in terms of USD, but they can't force the value of USD. They can influence with printing/inflation, but laws do not set value.


USD loss in value (due to inflation or strength of bitcoin), hello lower purchasing power


No it doesn't. Bitcoin prices are set by two things: USD prices, which are fairly static, and bitcoin purchasing power (which varies on adoption rate, usage, and speculation). Adoption rate of bitcoin, usage of bitcoin, and speculation have nothing to do with laws.
Remember again, Zimbabwe. The government didn't topple, but the value of the currency did. Laws do nothing for value, they can't even force the currency to be used... as Zimbabweans were using USD throughout the country as hyperinflation went its course. A government dictates what currency is used, but if there's no trust, it won't be used at all.

Doesn't have to be independently funded. Check out UL again. But yes, I agree, I won't trust an exchange again unless concrete steps are made to PROVE trustworthiness. Proof can happen when bitcoins are involved.
I have contacted my exchange about their processes recently. And that is the free market at work. I understand more about them.. and I wouldn't have it any other way.. especially not Mr Regulator in the way, screwing things up like always.


Guess what is the best group to punish offenders? Customers. Not authorities. That is why the group of exchanges has been so proactive about the Mt Gox failure. Because they **need** to be trusted.
@_date: 2014-02-28 12:23:51


It's a perfect illustration that regulations never make a marketplace perfect. Ponzi-schemes are illegal mate. You have the idea that no coercive regulations mean no regulations at all. It's wrong. Just as there are hundreds of mobile phones on the free market, all different, and providing choice, there are infinite ways to control a market voluntarily.. the one way with an overarching authority is perhaps the most stupid way.. but it's unfortunately popular with people like you.. that have no other imagination but forcing others to do your bidding.


Not so. The Great Depression happened because the Federal Reserve (created to eliminate depressions) reduced the supply of money in the market artificially. The starting cause of the GFC were regulations that encouraged lenders to grant loans to sub-primes. This wouldn't have happened if lending criteria were not written to reduce risk to banks in cases of default. There are a myriad other causes too.. but it wouldn't have happened without that. Wrong policy causes capital market distortions.


I don't actually care how much better or worse no regulations would have been. The great morality of no regulations means it's completely personal responsibility that dictates what happens to your own money. You can take risks and you can lose big-time. Your "regulations is god" way just makes [everyone pay for one person's mistakes]( That 2008 Act certainly stabilized your economy.. stabilized it as an underperforming one lol.

@_date: 2014-03-01 02:31:12


It seems like you have never studied regulations or any type of consumer reporting system.


And there's proof you don't know what you're arguing about. When you type UL into google, the **first link** that appears is  (wowwww would you believe that you'd get ul.com if you typed UL into google????)
UL (Underwriters Laboratory) is an organisation that tests and certifies products (and this **is paid for by it's customers!!!**) because the UL mark is [coveted by manufacturers around the world](


It was solely my decision to ask my exchange. They weren't compelled to answer questions, they did because it's best for them to have working relationships with their customers. If something is done voluntarily, its part of the free market.


You can but it's hardly done, because people expect their legislators to be doing that work. The legislators don't.


It does. Anything done voluntarily is part of the free market.


There is no Gox now. No customer will go to Gox after this. It's a nightmare for Mark Karpeles.. not a dream. **That is what happens in the free market.** 1) People who weren't safety conscious lost money in Gox. It was their fault. Solely. They have less bitcoins or cash now.. and I'll try to help them, but I won't be forced to help them. 2) Mark because he wasn't a good manager lost his business, lost his money (as far as we've seen) and now has to go through bankruptcy proceedings. Losing his company was his fault. Solely. No Gox customer will ever have business with him again. I won't be forced to help him.
In a regulated environment, I would be forced to help both customers and management of Gox. Not good.


And that is such a wrong simplistic statement. Do you understand that relying only on authorities means that there is no prior restraint against companies doing what they want. If Mark is cleared of wrongdoing, he'll only have to pay back what he can before he starts another venture.
Reputation means that in a free market, he's screwed. Only trusted people can be successful more than once. Unlike US banks.
Authorities probably have nothing against Gox. Customers can always threaten companies WAYYY more than authorities.
As we have seen with other exchanges, they have been set up (as much as possible so far) to avoid the problems that Gox faces. Without customers, companies are nothing.


Exactly. Everyone knows this. Even pre-primary kids understand this. Even toddlers. So, what they'll do to earn trust is (hopefully) start an auditing company, backed by majority of competing exchanges (like UL) that will audit their products. Any exchange that doesn't have this certification and regular audits will be known as dodgy. This business model has worked before, it's simple, voluntary, and effective.


Not exactly. The bitcoin protocol has many great advantages, companies signing transactions means that we don't just have to trust them. They can prove their work.

You're angry because you're wrong. The Zimbabwean government is still working just as strongly, and it still has an iron-grip on power.


It does nothing of the sort. Please don't be stupid. If production closed down throughout the world, all the dollars in the world wouldn't be enough to live on. Currency value is determined **only** by purchasing power. *Not by your precious laws!*
What actually happened in Zimbabwe, was people lost trust in the currency. Trust lost --&gt; Currency not accepted for any goods --&gt; Value falls as purchasing power depletes --&gt; Hyperinflation sets in. *Nothing to do with laws!* US Banknotes were the only acceptable way of paying for bread there at one time, because it's value was trusted, not because of Congress (*groan!*).


Exactly, as with every currency, your precious dollar bills included, the value rests only on trust. No laws can prevent hyperinflation (as Argentina is finding out!!).


Yes, but that does nothing to support your illogical position. Bitcoin needs to become more accepted.. and it will only do that by competing against the trust placed in other world-currencies. The great thing is, now government supported currencies have to compete too.
tl;dr: Laws mean nothing with currencies. All economists would tell you the same thing.

Ahh, no, people looked for shells when they were used, and they shaped them how there were needed.


There you are, you are the one that doesn't understand how markets work. In today's high-production environment, people would just make all the shells they wanted. And shells would be worthless, as they are now.

@_date: 2014-03-13 15:11:34


Yay, I finally got it through to you. Governments cannot set value.
Let's continue your absolutely wrong sea shells thought experiment. People would rush to find sea shells. If the government just said any shell would do, it might take 10 minutes of searching to find enough shells to buy a car. If the government stipulated a certain shell, they would be counterfeited. And people would just spend time doing that, and not producing anything. Then, every person in the country would be wanting to buy cars for practically nothing. Dealers would refuse to sell for any amount of shells, even as Arab oil sheiks flew into the country with their 747's chocked full of shells. They would be seeking to buy every car factory.
If governments pursued that enforcement, the factories would close down, because producers couldn't get the exact value in terms of sea shells (not with worldwide shells flooding the country).
So your example fails on every point. Shells would end up being worth a fraction of a cent, and no cars would be sold. It just goes to show, government's can't legislate value.


They can't, you're wrong.
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:15:29


There are actionable laws. Theft is illegal, so is fraud. They're also immoral. Things like insider trading? It isn't immoral to trade on what you know, even if you know more than someone else.
That said, doing "the dirty" will always make it hard for you to be able to legitimately trade with anyone face-to-face ever. And that is a big punishment.


In what way? You have to define the terms a little more rigourously. Say a trader amongst said company started insider trading? The auditor would have ensured that there were systems to detect and track those trades. Auditing can be made very thorough.. as your bank fees attest.
Also, auditors could provide a guarantee against loss to improve their reputation.


This doesn't happen to UL very much if at all, because of reputation. Why would you manufacture something with an expensive nearly insignificant UL label on it, hope that 1/1000 people will trust the label, then destroy your chance of selling to them again just for some short-term gain? Some might, but only once. You can't make a business on 'only once.'


There are still laws, just less of them. If you have proved that something illegal happened, feel free to let Police know in this instance.


When they "screw the market" that's just them being smart. It's not illegal and it's not immoral. It's the world I want to live in. People doing what they want, with no immoral check on moral behavior.
Bitcoins can be traced, it's only pseudo-anonymous. If theft happens the bitcoin wasn't secured enough, and there is a chance of finding the guilty party.

You're trying [ambiguity]( and [special pleading]( fallacies now. You said given, meaning governments give special properties to paper so they're valuable. Now, as I've shown that's false with the Zimbabwean experience, where they used USD even though they were supposed to use Zimbabwean currency.. because they were not going to use useless currency to buy what they needed.


Yes it does. Shouting nothing in caps does not make your argument special or even worthwhile.


No, but then I explained how people would stop using shells, because they would turn out worthless. So therefore even though governments gave value to shells, the shells were still worthless, and government wouldn't give value whatsoever.
Read back to what I wrote about the Zimbabwean currency. The government decreed their money as legal tender, but nobody used it because it was worthless, and nobody had enough. They used US Bills. Even to buy their bread.


Yes, I've broken through. You're right now, bitcoin is a currency. So is your house, but only to buyers that want it.. so your house has extremely little liquidity, which makes it impractical. Bitcoin is much more practical as a currency than your house, gold, and stocks. Also, it's nearly as good as our dollars, and soon will be much more useful and efficient.

It wasn't a progression argument at all. Comprehension please! I created a scenario, and went there as a thought experiment for you. If you think about it, it teaches you that laws do not a value create.
Asking the US Congress to pass a law saying my Lambo is worth $10 trillion USD does nothing to its value, it's still worth less that $1 million USD.


You've missed the point of my lesson.


Nothing would be exchanged through dollars if they were worthless.. Nevermind, production won't just close down, but the what-if scenario still proves that laws do not determine value.


Ah no, it's derived from the use that people get from bitcoins, and from the speculation of future value.
If bitcoin was:


Then exchange rates wouldn't change. They change, therefore bitcoin does not derive it's value simply from the US dollar or similar.

You speak as if I haven't heard the 'Ponzi-scheme' argument. It's always been false... but in case you still think you're right, I'll explain.
* In pyramid (Ponzi) schemes, founders persuade others that their product is valuable. With bitcoin, no guarantee has ever been made. It's there, take it, use it, or leave it.
* Pyramid schemes are a zero-sum system. Only the founder makes money, every other person loses the exact amount that the founder makes. With bitcoin, early and present adopters equally benefit from rising value, and can also lose from falling value.
* All buyers of bitcoin benefit from being able to use their coins. For a personal touch, I'll tell you what I do: I pay for as many things as I can in bitcoin, and then buy the equivalent amount of coins back. I don't lose, The seller wins because they have a secure easy-to-use currency that they can convert into anything they want.


Wrong. The money doesn't come from those 'losing' it. It comes from free-will transactions where people buy coins at a price they agree to. They haven't lost money, they have paid money. Taking your 'logic', bread is a ponzi-scheme because you lose $2 when you buy a loaf and eat it.. Obviously no gain there... all loss!!!! Pffft.


That single idea will make you broke. Bitcoin is supported by millions of users, and they all have different ideas of what bitcoin is. Don't try to tar everyone with your own thinking patterns.

Yes. You can look back at your previous comments by clicking your username in the top right corner.


**more** stable, secure market. You naively deal in absolutes when no market can be perfectly secure or stable. I'll let you off this once.
Yes. Logical principles, and evidence backing up those principles.

How is an unannounced tax on some savings security? With bitcoin, when you're careful, you'll never have your money taken from you. Never. Trust me, it's easy to be careful and secure.
The Cyprus savings tax was announced after EFT was halted on a Friday, and it went ahead before banks opened again on Tuesday... basically the authorities bailed banks out with money from people who didn't do anything wrong.
Gox was a sad event, but people with money there did something wrong, and paid for it.

The rate of vehicle depreciation means buying a new car is like cooking yourself a dog-turd breakfast: It doesn't taste nice, and is unhealthy... but at least people are interested when you tell them about it.

My argument is voluntary regulations.


A broken kind of law, but yes a law. Laws are great.. and the rule of law (a concept introduced by liberals) is one of the most wealth-supporting concepts ever. Law written by a majority to rule over minorities is not moral law though.


It may be a speculative joke... it's for The Free Market^TM to make that decision which it's making kind of well now... or maybe overeager governments might just do the godly thing and ban it.

Sounds just like any government I've heard of: "*Voluntarily* give us your money, and we won't inflate, we won't over-spend, and we certainly won't leave you in debt." Word is you can't escape this.. and you can't avoid it.
I have bought bitcoins many times. Never had a problem, and I (like many here) keep my own wallets, and spend too.
Please all; research, learn, and be cautious.

No worries, I do like genuine curiosity.
[Best study I can show you regarding effects of minimising regulations.](
There's also a recent study comparing market stability (which was your question after all) before and after the American Federal Reserve. I'll have to find it for you, it's interesting.
[As an aside, this sub is linked on the right-hand side, not strictly from an economics perspective, but because this ideology is about extending freedom to the maximum possible extent... socially and economically.](
It's a huge list of sources, discussions, sprinkled with some evidence in amongst the links. Granted, it's more about what such a society would be rather than prior evidence showing how more freedom could help rather than hinder. If you want some heavy reading, this is a great place.

Politically, people can say the dumbest things, believe the craziest theories, and suffer no consequences. That saddens me.
What then cheers me up, is the fact that reality has consequences. Sure, Mr Novelist can say stupid things about bitcoin, but the winners will almost certainly be people who dig deep and try to understand the new tech, without emotional biases.

Put away as much as you can ($5/$50/$500, doesn't matter) in a separate bank account each fortnight. It doesn't have to be much at all. Buy a small amount in a few weeks, and..
That's the start of your investment capital. :)

I have heard all of those talking points many times over. They crop up in news, opinion pieces, online articles.. and even BBC radio.
A few days ago on the BBC they were discussing the then "bubble" up to US$700 per BTC. One so-called economics professor was harping on the need for currencies to be transparent.. and then said the founder is "one missing Satoshi Nakamoto.. not looking too transparent is it?"
What the actual hell? Open blockchain, open-source, freely-traded.. how much more transparent does he need this? As transparent as the US Fed???? Or any other central bank? How's that working out?
And the Ponzi-scheme argument.. again and again. They shut up when a smart commentator points out that Ponzi-shemes are controlled from the top. and are designed to benefit one small group at the expense of the latest adopters. Bitcoin has no control, therefore cannot be a Ponzi-scheme.
Truth will win out, but hopefully it's loud enough that everyone doesn't walk away before it does.
