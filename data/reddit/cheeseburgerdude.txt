To answer the question everyone is likely asking here, BCH's value is likely artifically inflated by a recent stress test they've undertaken. If you change to Transactions on the chart on coinfairvalue, you'll see that a transaction spike coincides with the increase in fair value.
The stress test:

Ya know, I was going to mention that you seemed to be handling this information well, but I've gotta be honest here...
You created this site and this algorithm, and you made a post on talking about its value of $2500. At the same time, you've engaged in extended arguments with people who have questioned this value and have told them to "learn how it works".
Clearly you understand the algorithm. Given the fact that you seem to have started pushing this site on reddit just after BCH's stress tests began, is it much of a stretch to wonder if you knew about this anomaly the whole time and timed your promotion to coincide with the stress test?
It just seems like a hell of a coincidence(s) to me, is all... Hopefully I'm mistaken here and there's a perfectly reasonable explanation?

The model happens to take transaction volume into account and it also just so happens that BCH recently began a stress test which drastically artificially inflated transaction volume:

Works for me. Sorry to accuse you, it just seemed like a few coincidences too many given the date of these recent posts and the level of engagement with users commenting about the seemingly inflated FV of BCH.
