Traders could buy lots of bitcoin on the sly then bet it will go down and then sell their bitcoin which would make it go down they would make alot of money with alot less risk.

Once it has trust and stability then I think it will be used for day to day transactions. At present it is only really good for large transactions. I see this changing once max users have invested and scaling solutions are in place.

I support bitcoin as a legitimate form of storing and sending wealth and I accept any profit I make will be subject to tax. I then have to accept regulations regarding this.
@_date: 2017-12-02 12:53:58
No I think it's fine now as cash is king and today cash is dollar. If and when bitcoin is the main form of spending currency or at least on par with flat then it would be foolish.

You allocate HDD space to mine not cpu/ gpu. The more you allocate the more coins you can mine in time  basically.

They will be worth not much 1bum could be $20 a coin but one day could be worth more. If holding for long time keep em, and split any coins of value before exchanging for fiat. If one grows and is a threat to core then you will be glad you didn't split.

If everyone sells and doesn't fit on a block then stored in memory pool which priorities highest fees and will fill up. The lowest fees would get returned after time. Loads of people would get bitcoin back and the price would drop over time as proceed on the block. It would never go to 0 as someone will always value it and buy. And this system is able to work with just a few computers I think?
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:32:30
It will grow quick as new people invest going up and down until we trust it as a currency. At max point it will slow to a small stable % increases as population grows and output grows.

Bitcoin needs to be like a microwave oven. Its like everyone has a microwave and everyone uses a microwave and trusts microwave. But I bet not many could tell you how it works why it's safe...

If it increase like it did last year then it won't matter at what price you buy now. Imagine last year saying this when it was $1000 a coin or $1200 back then most people could own a few coins! but now your looking at 10%-20% of a coin. Maybe next year it could be 1%...

If you wait for a dip it won't happen and go up up up but if you buy now it will go down a bit. Don't panic just hodl and it will be ok

It divisable to 8 places more than enough for now. if needs to increase more then this would increase but would need to be a new version via a fork. If in future we work more with satoshi then it could be a cup of coffee is 3.25 satoshi me thinks
@_date: 2017-12-02 09:31:59
Bitcoin (block chain) is a system, and every system can be abused. I think the pros of having all transactions across the world recorded forever will do more good for humanity than the current fragmented money systems in place at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:11:04
I think that's in the hands of the big retailers, services and suppliers . I guess when they cant ignore the growing value bitcoin holds any more and decide they want to capitalise on it.

True but it's been called a bubble for like forever, when do we reach a point where it's not a bubble. Many predicted it would increase in value and it has. Big crashes have been caused by very low confidence in bitcoin but at this landmark 10k "event" confidence seems high. I could be wrong I guess but feel ok compared to how I felt a few weeks back after the cancelled fork, bch, difficulty, slow tx..

The price is driving adoption. Its not a bad thing. The masses need a good reason to participate and bitcoins fast inflation will slow when max people are using. When mr non tech guy uses/invests $ he doesn't care about how the banks create his cash just how much it's worth the same with bitcoin. Their are plenty of people/companys developing in the bitcoin space most also driven by price/profit. This is just the world we live in.

You can't trade bch on conbase yet so anyone new to crypto will most likely go in at a dip on bitcoin. Bch is being driven as a better chain and is growing uber quick in the shadow of no x2 not under all its own steam!. Soon we will forget the fork and get some traction back. Recent btc investers have had some gains, but it's dropping so they panic and leave driving down price. I'm thinking VHS vs betamax?  Still feel people will just want "bitcoin" for it "rare coins" and not a copy. if it eventually pushes bch down, hodl will be well worth it.

@_date: 2017-11-28 16:31:44
I Imagine it is accepted as payment for every product and service and won't have to cash out. If this future happens then anyone who brought in 2017-2018 will be set for life. This is why I would never sell not even 1 satoshi at present, opportunity like bitcoin don't come along often in life and all I have to do is wait and invest a little. If in 10-15 years this doesn't happen then I won't have lost alot and will still be happy. If I sell now I know I could regret it forever and grow old bitter and angry watching what could have been.
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:29:37
You can only mine a few 100s satoshi at home. Cost to do so will be greater than its value today. If you mine and hold, then in the future it could be worth it.

If the reciving address is correct then it will arrive or after time it will  return to the sender's wallet (too low fee can cause this). This is the great thing about bitcoin blockchain. It has never lost even the smallest satoshi in the 9 years of operation. All transactions can be checked from all time. So don't worry if address is right it will get there.

Oh no it gone back to a price it was years....sorry no, I mean  month's um no weeks.....I mean a few days 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:32:06
Sell if you want. Bitcoin at this early stage is very up and down. Invest in something stable with low returns if you want. I believe in bitcoin and what it could be one day so all the short term ups and downs don't worry me.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:26:28
You could learn to mine some as a hobby it won't be worth it today but over time it could.say an ok home pc mines 10k satoshi a week that's 99c today yay! If bitcoin goes to the moon it could be worth $100-$1k+ not bad for a week work doing nothing!. A years mining today could yeald $5k-$52k+ you never know.....
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:12:54
No yet. If adoption continues and trust is built causing stability retailers, suppliers and services will want to capitalise on it. Then I probably will use it as payments.

It your decision based on available info to you. Look at many factors . Market share, history, forums, gut instinct. No one knows the future and traditional trading tips and charts seem to not apply well to crypto. Bitcoin is not perfect but it's what people want at this point. its not always the best tech system that wins. Think VHS vs betamax. Anyone remember Video2000! 
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:07:40
You have a huge amount of BTC for a period of time and you don't know the best way to withdraw it   really? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:11:56
There is no massive threat to bitcoin at the mo its position is good just a few weeks ago there was alot more to worry about going on. We had a canceled fork losing confidence then bcash made new investers nervous as well. tx became a big megaphone issue same thing new investers sold and it dropped hard. It will be fine.

Its exciting times! put in what you can afford to lose and you never know. All regrets in bitcoin are from people who left thing too late or didn't hold. Remember alot of people won't just buy once but every payday. Future trading will start soon that may be good thing. Its a shame exchanges are a bit crappy at the mo but they don't make bitcoins only trade them. It may jump down as soon as you invest but don't panic it goes up and down alot but the bias is on the up over time. Outside of the bitcoin sphere you will only mostly hear about it going up is it a bubble. but day to day it goes all over the place. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:08:50
The system needs to be unhackable to work. To hack the security of the block chain would I imagine cause a fork to stop it happening again and to keep trust in bitcoin. It would cause a big loss in value but i think it would survive. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:23:13
Hodl and buy more.
@_date: 2017-11-27 13:49:28
Remember 1500 is about 15% of a coin so if it dips 1000 you will only lose 100. Hold and enjoy the ride. Could turn to shit or it could change your life.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:59:28
You can invest in part of a bitcoin. Buy 10%($750 ish) and if bitcoin goes up by $1000 ($7500-$8500) your profit will be $100. If it increases by £10,000 ($17,500) your 10% will give you $1000 profit.

Its going after people who don't pay tax on their gains and wallet transfers over 20,000. Its only a tiny amount of people. Bitcoin is not a way to avoid tax let's keep thing legit. I think it won't get mass adoption if people think it's a bit iffy.  bitcoin is so much more than a way to avoid tax.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:54:40
I don't see anything wrong doing it as a hobby yes you will by today's standards make a negative amount but in time it could be worth the cost of electricity and bother. If you mine 10k satoshi a week today is worth about $1. Hold if bitcoin goes to 100k per BTC. Then that 10k satoshi will be worth $10 and if its a million per BTC and that's $100 �� you can mine alt coins and sell for BTC. If you have loads of hhd space you can mine some alt coin without using any extra electricity. Read up about it it a fun hobby seeing your amount grow however small today. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:13:16
I swapped my hard earned money for bitcoins because I wanted bitcoins. More and more people seem to be interested in bitcoins. why would I sell??? I am well aware price goes UP and DOWN and am happy with my bitcoins. Good luck to everyone trying to make a profit by following the UPs of different coins.

How many cows is a bitcoin worth? 
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:16:23
I will hold. if i sell and buy back in I will have to buy bitcoin or X2. Once it is obvious which chain is bitcoin I think it will go up quick. If X2 wins then my money is safe. I could sell and buy X2 if its on the up, but to me that seems risky.

Bitcoin is the first and oldest coin. it has the most public awareness. Wall Street are soon going to bet on it. Atm are popping up. Big bang TV show whole episode soon (hope they hodl at the end). Coin base is growing quick. Japan bank to have bitcoin accounts. Coins are rare 16ish million with millions lost (probably). No one knows the future but I think it looks bright, for bitcoin, from this ath. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:18:15

It does that alot becaues its bitcoin.
look at its history
Many sells and buys at 10k
@_date: 2017-11-02 20:51:51
If you buy before the fork you will be invested in 2 different coins which one will win one will lose. once the winner is obvious I think the price will rise as confidence in buying will go up. If you do buy before you could sell one coin for a profit but you risk choosing the wrong one.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:34:46
I think it's more complex and no one knows what is going to happen even in the next hour let alone days weeks months. I read this as a negative post with no substance.

 brought some am today. may dip but I think when it passes 10k it will shoot up a bit 10.2k+ don't know but feels like it's winding up for a jump. But am probably wrong 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:13:05
As bitcoin grows and the amount of money in peoples wallets grow it will not be long before  a+ companies take bitcoin as a payment option. This will be very good for bitcoin me thinks.

Its a risk to say how you store your coins I think

Bitcoin feels strong atm. But history has shown tomorrow could be a different story. Only you can decide as its your money.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:43:46
All crypto are down so no threat from any of them. Extchanges been a bit crappy alot of weak hands selling. So not worried. it has gone up very quick recently. Price goes back a few days not a big deal over 9 years.  Will hold as bitcoin has been though alot worst in the past. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:32:48
Keep calm rollercoasters go up and down. Bitcoin will be fine. There are alot of good key events happening before the end of year. It has had a great year so far and suvived a list of unknowns. momentum from more new people is very good.
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:30:23
Tx needs to improve. And will in time. No one is buying bitcoin to use for small quick transactions. They want a stake in the future of the world's money system and or a profit.
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:11:19
More people are investing, older investers are investing more. Soon major company's and suppliers will want to capitalise on bitcoin and who know where the price will go...idk but I do know it's not over yet, exciting times are ahead me thinks ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:29:45
Gold has always been the goto safe haven, proven in the past. Bitcoin is just as safe in theory but has much more volatility atm and never been tested in a world crisis. I think it could do very well or it could not... idk maybe in a few years we will know more......
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:24:27
Yes. Always check address. Pc are the most likely to get copy paste hack so if wallet is on pc be extra vigilant. Un rooted android phones are more secure but it's good practice to always check. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 10:52:40
Yes sorry, Always check address especially if you copy and paste as  malicious software could change address to a different one.

Bitcoin has always been called a bubble. yawn. Many will hold and many will panic sell dropping the price. People who hold will buy more for less. With bitcoin it seems if you hold you will benifit. 9 years of big ups and downs.
@_date: 2017-11-11 21:34:32
I'm new to it!...don't know much about it.... I want a bitcoin thingy... its the talk of the town!...price is going to go up up up!....Off to Coin base I go to buy one. hmmmmm.. which one is bitcoin? bitcoin or the new bitcoin cash? The one that's been around the longest has the higher value and is widely accepted or the less accepted one with quicker transactions......hmmmmmmm...
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:44:31
Coin base act as a bank for your coins and this is ok (they are a trusted exchange). But the idea of bitcoin is YOU are the bank. When confident move any amount to your private wallet. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:44:37
It may go down the second you buy! be prepared for this. Ride it out and hopefully soon you will profit and even then it could drop to below your investment. Ride it out. It is a rollercoaster. There are plenty of good reasons to invest if you read up about it. The only negitve news at the mo is that it is a "bubble"... yawn... it's a bubble every week for 9 years!!!! fork it and rename it bubblecoin and news would then have to say "is bubblecoin a bubble?" 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:17:22
I brought some yesterday at 9.9k and then it dropped a bit. I thought I should have waited for a dip. Then today it's near to 11k. I feel now if you have a bit of cash to buy just do it. We all invest for a return and so far all investments i have done at any time in the past has done this. The key is to hold and not panic.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:48:58
I just brougt some high. Now in red with it but not bothered as I didn't buy to cash out soon. I'm investing in what bitcoin could become so if it does that I won't give a hoot. Some times I buy high sometimes low it will all add up and even out in the end. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:00:07
Well my last guess on bitcoin to win a hat a few weeks ago was 8725 by Jan 1. So I haven't a clue......

Bitcoin has suvived alot in its 9 years. It is totally going to survive a landmark ath. Buy the dip and hodl
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:12:23
Its climbing fast because more people want it and trust it. It will take a major world event to pop bitcoin.  Don't get me wrong it will dip as lots of investers with weak hands are looking short term for profit. It could drop if exchanges fkup But today it's worth its value.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:14:23
All landmarks have huge sell orders but bitcoin has passed them all so far  $1 $10 $100 $1000. It has great momentum so am not worried at all. Buys will soon outweigh sells. Its great that there has been no worrying dips so far ��. Its in a good place at the moment.
@_date: 2017-11-05 00:40:48
I think it is safe due to the fact if coinbase fucks it's customers it will lose out. Its doing really well and it's not in its interests to be a dick. For a fee you can send to a wallet then you will be responsible for your money not them. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:32:47
If you have a pc get it to mine some satoshi it could pay off in the long run. Do you have anything you don't need then sell it and buy some. The thing with bitcoin is if it goes to the moon you will regret the past as so many do today. I feel it has plenty of room to rise based on current events. In 2009 a home pc could mine 50 BTC a day if we knew then where it was going anyone  rich or poor could be mega rich today. 50btc back then was worth less than the electric used to mine so no one cared/bothered. Today is the same for mining satoshi.

Its an amazing system of storing and transfering people's hard earned money with nearly a decade of uptime with 100% reliability. Every transaction is recorded and available always. Only I own the key to my money which only I can move. Also I want to burn up the sea of tranquility in my Lambo 
@_date: 2017-10-30 23:17:17
The network which holds and moves your money is unbelievably reliable by design. All historic transactions are always available. It has worked for many years billions of 100% transactions. Issues are always with the user this is why I invest in it.
