Yep, going back up

Well I was actually thinking it'd be pronounced M-Bit. haha  Not sure if we want people associating Hanson with Bitcoin!

Thanks, I'll give that a shot

'that'll be 30 m-bits please'   sounds good to me

Yeah, I hear what you're saying.  I'll take a look at GPG and Truecrypt as Natanael_L mentioned above.  Having the need for strong security and encryption is all new to me before having Bitcoin.

I got a chance to listen to this one on the drive into work this morning, Adam puts together one of best bitcoin podcasts.  Always enjoy listening to them.

I have a Dropbox, so I was thinking of using that.  Is there a way to add further security to a specific folder or file I'm Dropbox?

Personally I was a little thrown off during one of the short music breaks, thinking - oh is the podcast over already?
  Some people might like the break, but I'd prefer it to keep going!

I was wondering where you got that music from.  Definitely give them some credit for that, I thought it sounded great.
Having some short sets between topics is not a bad idea.  Worth trying a few times until you get more feedback.

Libertybit.com allows you to send email money transfers.  $2 fee and you'll have the money in your account after 24 hours.  I've used it a few times and it worked great.

So just to clarify how I understand it right now.  Once the wallet is encrypted, and then backed up in multiple locations.  There's no need to backup the same wallet again (in the same locations) because that wallets private key never changes, even after multiple transactions within that wallet?

Could we shorten it even further to an 'mBit'?   Still not great, but it's easy until the community agrees on a name

I have two questions about backing up my wallet(s).
1.  I have a Bitcoin QT wallet on my iMac and was looking for the wallet.dat file.  I've searched and read everything about finding it on a mac, and every time they say goto Library &gt; Application Support &gt; Bitcoin.  But that folder doesn't exist on my machine.  I even did a Spotlight and searched 'Bitcoin', and nothing comes up.  Does anyone know if that info is old and if there's a new way to find the .dat file?
2.  Backing up my wallets.  I have my iMac backed up by Time Machine.  Is that a reasonable way to restore my wallet if my machine craps out?  I understand the argument if my house burnt down or that sort of thing.  But until I find the wallet.dat (see Q.1).  Will that do?

Being Canadian, it's fun listening to the Ed and Ethan show, but I like to describe them as 'high on Bitcoin'!

Thanks, I'll check that out.
