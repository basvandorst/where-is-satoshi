y. When I started investing in crypto I thought we all were on the same boat and want crypto to succeed but that's just stupid to think like that :D  people never change. To me its sad that people change their beliefs when confronted with problems, every crypto will have their issues.

y. I dont usually comment on the internet but and really triggered me. I guess I just have to take some time off off reddit for awhile. :d

Come back when scaling is not a problem. If you cant stand the heat get out of the kitchen.
Edit: and the kitchen is crypto in general.
@_date: 2018-09-09 12:06:49
Just the fact that money should not be controlled by anyone thats all.
Edit: and I would like to see a bitcoin standard world so ppl would think more what they buy. I would imagine ppl would only buy quality merch that lasts.
@_date: 2018-09-07 23:02:26
Is it so hard to believe that you can buy products with bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-15 15:08:06
Correct.

lol :D good for you I'v been here since 2014 and bought at 400e but why so emotional? just cant figure out why people get so rekt from dips. If you have been here since 100$ btc you should know that this is normal behavior it goes up and down :D But seriously its good to take profits :)

I dont have an answer to your question but I really like seeing posts like this on an down trend its not like dec 2017 FOMO. Remember, your private keys your bitcoin don't keep them on an exchange unless you are planning on selling in the near future! 
@_date: 2018-05-24 10:11:40
Lets hope so :P

Sell 10 and hold the rest

I agree dont get me wrong I meant market wont go up continuously but we will see higher lows. Ups and downs is the name of the game
@_date: 2019-02-23 19:51:37
market will go down again for sure but its just waves of many until we reach new ath. when looking at btc eth ltc and mco the trend switched at that time. but yeah no one knows the future. 2019 will be interesting and exciting for those who are in cryptos.

FYI its the best time to accept bitcoin when you get more satoshis for peoples bucks :) 
edit: only read the title

Core if you have the space and patience to download the blockchain otherwise Electrum Is good IMO.

Not your keys not your Bitcoin. Probably a good idea to control your keys :)
@_date: 2019-04-21 15:33:40
Dont know many but try PungoWallet app
@_date: 2018-11-06 15:40:59
1k hodler
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:47:28
Use it and the price will find its place. wont be any good if everyone hodls it.
My point is ppl need to use btc to be valuable
@_date: 2018-03-05 11:39:25
I really hope so. Im rooting for monaco since the second region is EU where they plan to release it.

Why Monacocard is not on the list? 
@_date: 2018-11-15 13:59:27
sadly we are not at that point. ppl are now getting used to the idea of crypto visa cards but i think that will lead to crypto only future eventually 
&amp; it could happen earlier if there rly is a need for it
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:42:43
This should be pinned. Nice action!

@_date: 2018-12-24 11:40:37
.................This has been happening for a while now....and still happening... and no 99%ppl here dont think its a stock. "we need a Bitcoin revolution" Bitcoin is the revolution... pls new ppl lurk for a couple of years and then speak.
@_date: 2018-12-04 17:26:47
Good for you! You bought at the time when its wise to accumulate just ignore the price posts no need to get worried. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:32:40
Ye it would be nice but I think its just a wave of many untill close to halvening (looking at logarithmic chart)
