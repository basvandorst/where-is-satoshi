And how's the business going? Are there enough clients willing to pay in btc?  
I have no idea about Venezuela but I lived in Brasil and living there is actually very expensive (probably on the price level with Germany imho)... XBT freelancer doesn't seem to me lively enough to really make a living

There is also one in Jakarta but how crazy gangsta movie is that.    
The only possibility seems to be teaming up with someone who'd accept and convert the BTC for him (actually, it looks like a business opportunity).   
  
I've seen this kind of bartering here before - "I have 300 usd on skrill and want to buy btc, I'm happy if you make profit", I am sure this would work in this case too   
  
(OP just don't say in the title "I am from Bangladesh pls buy btc from me or I go to jail")

Let's just make a law that would enforce all terrorists to use [the evil bit]( Simple as that.

Similar here (different field). I am implementing downloadable products for bitcoin just to support its use.   
But Reddit is used for shameless plugging all the way, and a relatively large part of the community supports bitcoin. That is, compared to other places on the web. I suppose when you just normally go about mentioning your product on relevant places on reddit, and if you are stating clearly somewhere on your landing page that you accept bitcoin, enthusiasts who will want to buy your stuff will naturally opt for coins.
