bring the huge dip, My fiat is ready in Gemini.
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:39:52
never use coinbase... horrible company, they may lock your account without response for months
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:53:52
you will come back, I am sure
@_date: 2018-01-09 19:21:04
For everyone has their money missing/suspended/locked in, and cannot get a response from coinbase/gdax for months:
Can we file a lawsuit against them? anyone know the legal process of this?

whales: big players trying to manipulate the market
This little dip is nothing. I will call it a dip when I see -10%. 
During the China FUD and bcash attack, the price crashed more than -30%. Just Hodl and enjoy the ride, maybe buy a little more at lower price.

Gemini is awesome except for the website appearance. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:54:11
What if all of us submit complains to bitstamp about the name confusion? Let Bcash be bcash!
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:08:18
Ltc and eth are not shitcoins. They are very solid coins. Yes, they could rise more before a major correction
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:36:28
What’s your point? Banks always have faster transactions and are able to handle larger loads of transactions. That’s not the point of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-17 12:04:57
For free offline wallet, electrum is a good one. But I strongly recommend ledger or Trezor if you plan to hold your coin long term.
@_date: 2017-12-19 08:16:27
I feel there is a big rally of btc coming soon... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:10:17
buy a hardware wallet! dont trust any exchange!
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:06:43
This is insane now. Load your money, prepare for a correction, guys.

Does this mean this is the last time we could get the Chinese discounts? kinda sad... haha
@_date: 2018-02-02 19:27:21
look at the huge bubbles in the US stock market and Chinese real estate; look at the amount of fiat printed during the QE...
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:55:34
just a normal dip, no big news driving btc from 8k to 11k either. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:25:32
back to 10k! Happy Chinese New Year!
@_date: 2017-09-18 07:24:12
whoever holds the private key owns the bitcoin. All wallets are just storing and protecting your private keys. Hardware wallet is best in terms of safety right now. 
@_date: 2018-02-07 00:23:40
gemini, bitstamp
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:06:15
I dont get people panicking and upset over this China banning exchanges news. If you guys truly understand bitcoin and have faith in it, the you should know that any single country regulating bitcoin does not affect its future at all. Bitcoin will grow stronger with or without China. Given that Chinese government has been outsmarting most western country governments over the past 20 years, I highly doubt they will completely outlaw bitcoin. When China brings Bitcoin back, which I think will definitely happen sometime, it will go to the MOOON!

This guy is a brilliant nut. Brilliant, but still a nut...

I live in Chicago, and I hope I can have the freedom, like almost all Chinese, of walking on the street during night without the fear of being shot.  
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:45:06
end the CIA? Maybe?
@_date: 2018-03-29 10:24:10
wth is happening to bcash
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:44:15
That's just not true. I am sure all those rich Chinese people buying houses in Seattle and California all cash need no government approval at all. The reason China cracked down crypto is same as that Federal Reserve hates Bitcoin. Chinese government is just having better control of their system than the fed. So they can act quickly and efficiently. And they dont have those fake "freedom" value to preserve like most western countries.
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:52:18
"People in China are using Bitcoin to move their wealth and keep it out of the hands of the government. "
This is exactly the same reason I buy Bitcoin in US. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 09:57:26
survives drop from 19k to 6k, why panic now?
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:59:19
they actually demand $15... Delusional progressives... 
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:18:31
Get a Ledger, if you plan to hodl and buy more later.
@_date: 2018-02-07 01:38:32
support fiat, low trade fees, gemini also waives the withdraw fee (not sure about bitstamp)
gemini only support US; if u r in Euro, use bitstamp
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:32:04
I hope we can have the freedom of making sure our tax $$ not flowing into endless meanless wars. No matter who we elected, those wars never end. At least, the Chinese tax $$ get them beautiful modern high speed trains. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:49:26
Never take nobel winning guy seriously. you know, even Obama has one. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:35:46
I think the rich Chinese can get their money out of China even without Bitcoin. Look at all the rich Chinese buying the real estate in California and Seattle. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 04:50:33
Good, I love Chinese discounts. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 05:09:30
China banning all guns, their streets are much safer than most of US cities... 
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:55:27
It can be recovered .
@_date: 2017-09-18 19:58:01
Don't leave your bitcoin on exchange long term. Google Mt. Gox
@_date: 2018-02-18 13:54:05
being panic about such a little dip means you ARE putting more than you can lose... Anyway, good luck!
