I've been meaning to write a brief article on this for some time, but have had some qualms about it. Please understand that this is in no way a recommended method for generating keys. It's really cool (imo) and should not be considered beyond general, low-stake shits and giggles.

If you want your funds to be safe stick to a hardware wallet like a Trezor or a Ledger. Funds on a mobile wallet are about as safe as the cash you would carry with you in a wallet. It's very susceptible to loss and/or theft. Sure you can back up your seed if you lose your mobile wallet, but it's still a risk not worth taking.

Oh absolutely. When it comes to tackling the challenge of user experience having something relatable like an image and a password makes the idea of key ownership much easier to grasp for some. Also, I really like the idea of using the image as a desktop background, that's too fun.

Something like scheduled price notifications every x minutes or hours? I like that idea.
@_date: 2018-08-10 17:05:17
I'm a solo dev for coindeck. Tempted to add that as a feature for the next release. I just rolled out price notifications. Adding scheduling functionality wouldn't be too difficult. Hmmmm
@_date: 2017-02-17 03:21:20
Pretty much. Any tampering that ultimately affects the data URI of the file will return a different private key and address.
@_date: 2017-02-17 03:37:40
I noticed that when I uploaded the "Test Image" to imgur earlier. Not sure what goes on server-side during the upload, but they do make a few changes during the process. I had to re-save the image from imgur and use that as the file to generate the keys from.
@_date: 2017-02-17 01:54:17
That is correct :-)
@_date: 2017-02-17 15:14:47
I didn't realize imgur stripped all EXIF data, that's awesome. Regarding the password feature, I just made another commit to the project implementing something similar to what you've posted above.  Thanks for the feedback on the project. Glad you enjoyed it!
@_date: 2017-02-17 03:25:57
As I mentioned to any tampering that ultimately affects the data URI of the file will return a different private key and address. So if you're capable of removing the hidden pixel in a way that re-forms the intended/original data URI then you're gold.
@_date: 2017-02-17 01:22:42
You would enter the same image with the same password that would then generate the same private key that you started with. You would then sweep that private key with a wallet of you choice. The best part about the potential solution above is that if someone became informed of your image and managed to copy/capture it they will only be able to generate unused private keys (assuming you didn't use any) until they captured your password as well.
@_date: 2017-02-17 01:32:54
As pointed out brainwallet.io has this functionality along with the ability to set a password or pin. :-)
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:51:32
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:57:37
Exactly. This has been discussed before by using different means such as steganography as well. (
@_date: 2017-02-17 01:31:00
Nice! I didn't know this.
@_date: 2017-02-17 00:31:41
Thanks! I agree. The best solution I can think of at the moment would be to place it into a password protected zip file. 
However, a better solution would be to take advantage of the CryptoJS library and apply something like "CryptoJS.AES.encrypt('hash', 'secret key 123')" prior to generating the keys. This would basically result in a completely different set of keys when used on a file or image.
@_date: 2019-03-26 16:58:20
You can do this, but you should never consider it a safe source of entropy or way of creating private keys. An example of this can be seen here ( by using the bip39.entropyToMnemonic method.
For fun I even created a tool to turn any picture/document into a private key ( Again, while really cool and fun you should never consider this as safe way to create private keys you intend to store large amounts on.

For sure. While it's definitely not safe, it's still pretty cool, imo.
@_date: 2019-11-05 17:44:37
It's an intentionally chosen trade-off. I mostly built this wallet for myself for several reasons. The ability to spin up and tear down wallets with little to no friction was one of the features I really wanted. I will admit, once it comes out of beta, I should more directly suggest that they backup their seed upon initially opening the app, but I don't think we should force the user through this process every single time. It creates too much friction and we don't know nor should we assume how they intend to use the wallet.
@_date: 2019-03-26 13:23:38
Haha, I don't believe I've reached that rank yet, but I'm working to get there. Thanks!
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:57:54
I'm curious what you would think of the wallet I'm developing, Moonshine ( It autogenerates a wallet for you when you open it and doesn't force you to write down the phrase.

If you're interested in building something like lightning chess from koalastud.io I would suggest taking a peek at [opennode]( That's what koalastud uses to handle and process the lightning payments. The downside is that it's a third party service, but it lets you get up and running for experimentation pretty quickly.

@_date: 2019-11-05 19:34:29
I completely understand your position. As I mentioned, once out of beta, I will more directly suggest to the user that they should backup their seed, but I don't think we should ever force a user to go through this process if they don't want or need to at that time. That should be up to the user not a mandated design decision.
@_date: 2019-11-08 19:21:10
Nice, thanks. That thing was seamless (for me at least) at the conference.

Is that the same ATM that was setup at the lightning conference? What company is it?
@_date: 2019-11-06 13:13:19
Agreed. I believe a popup should appear suggesting they backup their phrase when they first make a new wallet and if the app sees that a wallet has a balance and hasn't been backed up yet.
@_date: 2017-08-16 16:09:07
Looks like a physical, *not a remote*, attack was found. As stated in the post:
* It is important to note that this is not a remote execution attack. To exploit this issue, an attacker would need physical access to a disassembled TREZOR device with uncovered electronics. It is impossible to do this without destroying the plastic case.
* If your device does not leave your presence, your coins are safe. Moreover, if you have a passphrase enabled and actively use it, your coins are safe. Yet, we strongly recommend you to update your TREZOR anyway.

This website might help you better understand what's going on when adding a bip39 passphrase to a mnemonic:
*Note: Don't add your mnemonic to this site. Use the "GENERATE" function that it provides to create a test mnemonic for you instead.*
@_date: 2019-08-10 02:57:10
Nope :-)
@_date: 2019-08-20 20:31:10
This is an awesome question.
If you're concerned about having to store too many backups of different mnemonic phrases it would make most sense to sweep the funds from the old wallets into the wallet app you intend to continue using. Cons: This method requires you to make an on-chain transaction. You will eventually have to pay a larger fee when you attempt to consolidate these utxos. PRO: You only need to store the mnemonic phrase of the wallet that you intend to continue using. I believe this is the Eclair wallet in your case.
If you don't want to make this on-chain transaction and you don't mind having multiple, separate wallets it would make most sense to simply import the wallets into the wallet app you intend to keep using. This assumes that Eclair supports holding multiple mnemonic phrases/wallets at the same time. I'm not sure if it does...? Cons: Not all wallets support multiple accounts/wallets. You will need to backup an additional mnemonic phrase with each import. Pro: No need to make an on-chain transaction to move the funds to your new wallet.
Personally, I would just sweep them to my main wallet with the lowest fee possible that the wallet provides.

You can do this, but it's not recommended especially if you're looking for a secure long-term solution. Buy a trezor or ledger instead. 
You can also encrypt the image with a password. Here's the example implementation I made a while back:

I'm curious how people feel about the RBF workflow demonstrated in the video. Is it easy to understand? Are there examples of easier implementations that should be pointed out? Overall, adding RBF was a ton of fun. I learned a lot from it.
@_date: 2019-10-09 18:07:51
I made a suuuuuper basic app about a year ago for fun to track price movements. It checks for movements that are greater than or less than a specified value every 2 minutes. So, I'm not sure that's what you're looking for. It's not open-source, but was considering re-writing it and open-sourcing it so anyone can spin up their own portfolio/price-notification app. [iOS]( [Android](
@_date: 2019-06-11 22:56:38
Thanks! I thought they had RBF. Looks like it might be on their roadmap? 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:55:08
Many kudos, that looks wonderful.
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:23:24
Correct, it effectively creates an entirely new transaction/TXID with the only difference, in this instance, being the higher fee. From these two transactions miners will accept the one with the higher fee while ignoring the previous lower fee transaction.
As you mentioned, RBF can also be used to "double spend" by changing not only the fee, but one of the addresses contained in the outputs as well. By doing this you would basically be able to send the BTC back to your own wallet minus the higher fee necessary to initiate the "double spend". Bitbip does not directly allow for this type of "double spend" RBF at this time, but I may add a "Cancel Transaction" button that would attempt to send the funds from the 0-conf transaction back to the user's wallet.
@_date: 2019-06-11 21:51:14
Thanks for the feedback! I couldn't agree more. I made it to where you can hold down the plus/minus buttons and it will update much faster, but some users really prefer a text field. Similar to what you mentioned, in a future release I will probably just turn the the number next to "sats/byte" into a text field for people to adjust as they wish.
@_date: 2019-06-15 14:04:34
This would most-definitely be ideal for a Lightning transaction, but not for an on-chain Bitcoin transaction. Using RBF (Replace-By-Fee) a user can simply "Cancel", if you will, a transaction by rebroadcasting it back to themselves with a higher fee.
I literally just added this feature to a wallet I'm developing. [Screenshot](
Edit: A word.
@_date: 2019-06-14 17:13:52
   ;-)
I mean, it can always be used maliciously, but at the same time it's not uncommon for someone to goof up and send to the wrong address by mistake. So it's nice to know that if such a mistake were to occur you still might be able to correct it if you manage to catch it in time. Should be released in the next build within about a week or-so.
@_date: 2019-06-12 13:01:02

Edit: Link - 
@_date: 2019-06-11 20:27:32
Sure thing. RBF (Replace-By-Fee) effectively allows you to increase the fee of an unconfirmed transaction sent from your wallet. One reason you may do this is if you initially created a transaction with a really low fee and later determine that it's taking too long to confirm, you can speed up the confirmation time of the transaction by increasing the fee.
So it's not really a smart fee calculator, more-so a way to ensure that you have a method at your disposal to increase the fee of a transaction during times of high-fees or increased network traffic.

The image in Andreas' post utilized steganography to embed a *signed transaction* into the image that transferred $12M.  Thinking this was super neat, I thought it would be fun to turn the image itself into the seed and did so. For fun I generated a mnemonic phrase using the image without a BIP39 passphrase and sent 0.00095133 BTC to, "bc1q57euh23y3qs2f9d5mtwpax5lqecfvrdkqce82a". This was quickly swept as expected. I also generated another with a BIP39 passphrase and sent 0.01 BTC to it's address here, "bc1qcyrndzgy036f6ax370g8zyvlw86ulawgt0246r".

However, as many have commented here, it's a chicken &amp; egg problem. While a few wallet apps already utilize BitId (Mycelium &amp; Airbitz) many Bitcoin sites don't seem to support it for some reason. For starters, maybe can fill us in on why Coinbase doesn't support this form of login/authentication  :-)
Inaltoasinistra, if you're looking for a bit of BitId fun I setup a quick &amp; dirty demo over a year ago here ( It demonstrates how a user could use BitId for user/account creation and handle subsequent logins.

@_date: 2019-01-31 04:16:39
Most definitely. That's how a lot of app developers test/troubleshoot their apps before testing them on an actual device. I wouldn't recommend it though. Most wallet apps will provide a mnemonic phrase that you will want to write down and keep in a safe place instead. If you ever happen to lose access to your phone and the wallets that phone contained you can always backup your wallet using the saved mnemonic phrase on any other compatible desktop or mobile app. If you still want to experiment with an Android emulator, however, I would recommend downloading Android Studio and going from there.
@_date: 2019-01-28 21:22:23

To further ease your mind you can always withdraw a small amount, verify that it went to the appropriate address and then withdraw the remaining desired amount.

Thanks! I really like the idea of being able to show and compare previous year/month/week price data on the chart. Helps to put things into perspective. Thanks for the feedback!

I just recently released Coindeck about 2 weeks ago. Please feel free to give it a look and let me know if you have any feedback.

I really need to publish the second part of this [article]( where I discuss how to, "Timestamp &amp; Prove A Document Existed At A Certain Point In Time".
In short, all you need to do is generate a unique Bitcoin address with your file using [bitimage]( and send a small amount of BTC to the address. Like 30 cents worth, or as little as your wallet will let you. Once that transaction confirms it proves that your document existed at the blockheight it confirmed at. 
There's no need to bloat the blockchain by uploading the hash file. Instead, a simple transaction to the address your unique file generated is enough to prove its existence.

Looks like you may need to increase the Gap limit in Sentinel. Had you sent the sats to one of the first 20 addresses, then it would have seen and displayed your transaction. But since it appears the Gap limit is set to 20 it's going to stop checking after it sees the first 20 addresses with no activity. Setting the Gap limit to 230 would correct this.
I'm not sure if Sentinel allows you to adjust the Gap limit, but I know Electrum will let you if you need to recover your funds. Blockonomics had a decent article [here]( on how to do that.

Pieter?! Thank you for everything. I've been really enjoying going through your recent work on the Miniscript project. 
Regarding the comment, so it's functionality is extended to allow for file-batching, but I'm still trying to understand why one would choose to commit the hash of the Merkle root to the blockchain when an address can be generated from the root and used instead.
I'll need to do some more digging/learning :-)

I'm currently developing a Bitcoin point-of-sale app for both Android &amp; iOS. I intend to release it for beta testing within the coming weeks. If you or your friend are interested in early access beta testing of the app feel free to PM me your email address and whether you intend to test on Android or iOS.
Some images for reference:
I'm open to feedback! Let me know what you want to see in a pos app.    :-)

That makes sense, thank you for the explanation. I've also never come across, sign-to-contract before. Found an [article]( and [blog]( post on it that I look forward to digging into. Thanks!

It's still in alpha, but I would really appreciate testers and some constructive feedback/criticism.

The only permission for the app is the camera and only requested and used when attempting to scan qrcodes. There are no analytics or any other PII data collected. It connects automatically to public Electrum servers to interact with the Bitcoin network, but you have the option to connect to your own server if you have one up and running. All sensitive operations, like key creation and signing, are handled client-side (on the phone, as it should be).
Finally, this is a non-custodial hot wallet so your funds will only be as secure as your device. However, the app can be configured for both biometric and pin authentication that will wipe the device after 5 failed pin attempts. The app also supports a BIP39 passphrase for any created wallet.
If you have any questions, don't hesitate to reach out.

Malicious actors need to be called out in the social arena in order to bring understanding and transparency to the agenda they're trying to push. Improvements to BTC will continue regardless of the politics and social squabbles.

Using bitcoinjs (
    
    var bitcoin = require('bitcoinjs-lib');
    var bitcoinMessage = require('bitcoinjs-message');
    var keyPair = bitcoin.ECPair.makeRandom();
    var privkey = keyPair.toWIF();
    var address = keyPair.getAddress();
    var msgkeyPair = bitcoin.ECPair.fromWIF(privkey);
    var message = "My unique and specific message";
    var signature = bitcoinMessage.sign(msgkeyPair, message);
    var signature = signature.toString('base64');
One example of a practical application would be for user authentication such as BitId (
I personally played around with BitId for a bit last year. A demo of it can be found here ( If you have a Bitcoin wallet like Mycelium you can use that to register your user and log in and out by simply scanning a qrcode.

For those who are not a fan of paywalls... (ProTip: To avoid a paywall simply Google the title and click the link from there. Works for me ~90% of the time.)
Entrepreneurs Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss chose State Street Corp. to help them launch a new exchange-traded fund based on the virtual currency bitcoin, according to a regulatory filing Tuesday.
The twin brothers are hoping the Securities and Exchange Commission approves their new fund, the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust, after a process that has already gone on for more than three years. In its latest filing, a seventh amendment to its original filing, the brothers said State Street, based in Boston, would serve as transfer agent, while San Francisco-based Burr Pilger Mayer will act as auditor.
The transfer agent acts as a fund’s administrator, responsible for recording ownership changes, calculating the daily net asset value, and maintaining records.
Burr Pilger Mayer, meanwhile, will conduct monthly “proof of control” exercises, essentially an audit to show that all the bitcoin reported as being held by the fund are legitimate. The exercise will be carried out by Gemini, the Winklevoss’s exchange and trust company that will act as the ETF’s custodian, and results will be verified by Burr Pilger Mayer.
Bitcoin is a digital currency that isn’t backed by any government or private entity. It was launched in 2009 by an anonymous person calling himself Satoshi Nakamoto.
The price of bitcoin in its earlier days was wildly erratic, and indeed is still volatile. However, since a spike in late 2013 and crash in early 2014, it has been more stable. This year, it has generally been rising, and is up about 48%, trading recently at $635.
An SEC-approved ETF could attract more mainstream investors to the asset, but that isn’t a sure thing and it is unclear how the SEC will rule. There has been a fairly competitive race to get a bitcoin ETF out to the investing public, and it is seen as a key conduit for the digital currency to gain exposure to more mainstream investors.
There is already a bitcoin ETF on the market, the Bitcoin Investment Trust from Barry Silbert’s Grayscale Investments. It trades over the counter and hasn't been approved by the SEC. In addition, another offering from a firm called SolidX is awaiting SEC approval.

Agreed. The Coinbase case will be interesting to watch. Looking forward to a solid implementation of Confidential Transactions to resolve this concern though.

There was a great video with Andreas on this exact topic. Definitely worth watching.

I don't have the legal knowledge to speak intelligently on this, but I would say that's doubtful. Realistically they cannot prove that you own the address that you're sending to.

Simply encrypt and store an image or document. Even if they somehow figure out the file holds Bitcoin they'll never get to it without the password.

Right there with you. I feel like it's not getting the attention it deserves. 
I've been experimenting with BitId and managed to setup a React-Native implementation of BitId for both iOS and Android using bitcoinjs-lib and bitcoinjs-message for the back-end heavy lifting/signing. The UI needs to be prettied up, but it's basically functional. It has three tabs, one for tapping and scanning, one for a list of previous logins, and one for settings.
I've also setup a BitId site using php here:

I sent [0.01 BTC]( to the kitten photo Andreas once used to demonstrate steganography. There's a challenge to find the seed detailed [here]( if you're interested. I use a different method of hiding/generating the seed than what is discussed here.
@_date: 2019-05-21 13:06:16
I've been wanting to write an article on this. I setup a demo site of what I'm about to discuss on [Github]( as well.
The method you described of hiding your seed in the image is similar to what Andreas Antonopoulos did using steganography in [this image]( However, there are other ways of hiding a seed in an image. The Github site I posted above will accept any image, file, document, etc and return a mnemonic phrase or seed by passing the datauri of the file to bip39.entropyToMnemonic. In this case it's a sha256 hash of the datauri. Now if you pair that with a BIP39 passphrase you will require both the image and the BIP39 passphrase to recover your key.
For fun I even sent 0.01 BTC to the kitten image Andreas previously used to demonstrate steganography. The details of this can be found [here](

Yep, thanks for the suggestion! On line 421 of [this file]( You'll see I pass the message to Buffer as utf8 and then hand that off to bitcoinjs-lib to embed and add as an output.

This is a bit of self-promoting, but if you accept payments in person feel free to give narwhallet a try:
Inputting a Bitcoin address allows customers to pay either directly to that address with Bitcoin or via Shapeshift if they wish to pay using an altcoin.
I'm the dev if you have any questions about it.

The wallet is still in alpha, but I've open sourced the code on github here, ( Both iOS &amp; Android links for testing are there as well.
Basically, when sending a transaction you simply include whatever text you want in the "Message" field. If you have any questions or feedback feel free to reach out.
