He's not worried about the taxes. He just has a bunch of illegally attained cash that he wants to launder.
Say he has $1,000,000 to launder. At today's value, $500 per coin, that's 2000 coins. What OP is looking for is someone that acquired 2000 coins when they were only $2, to sell the whole wallet, without moving the coins, for that million bucks. The seller only paid 2000 x $2 = $4000, and now sells them for a million.
The money launderer can now say, as he spends his coins for $500 each, that HE acquired them a couple years ago at $2 each. He is happy to pay the tax, he just can't explain to the IRS how he came about owning a million bucks in the first place.
This is not likely to happen, as now the *seller* has $1,000,000 in cash that he can't explain how he came by, without giving up the original money launderer.
@_date: 2014-02-22 21:29:41
There are plenty of crypto exchanges that now let you exchange one currency for another, no fiat involved, and no ID process involved. Just set up an account with a user name and password on a few of them. (Always using a VPN, of course)
For example, move 2 BTC from one of your wallets into a new empty wallet, trade those BTC for LTC one an exchange. Pull those LTC to a different exchange, ( a couple days later) and trade them for PPC. Move to another exchange and trade for DOGE. Move to another exchange and trade the DOGE back to BTC, and bring those BTC back to a third new wallet that you've created for just this purpose. Spend from the laundered coin's wallet. When you need more funds, create a couple "new" wallets, pull some BTC from cold storage and do it all over again. Never use an address to either send or receive more than once, and discard and never use again any wallets used for these purposes. 
Also, and maybe most importantly, DON'T leave coins sitting in a coinbase wallet, keep them under your own thumb, unless you need some BTC there for a purchase. But for an individual, I don't really know of anything that having any coins on coinbase allows me to do that I can't do from my own machine, and using various Armory wallets to do it.

CampBX lets you open an account with simply a username and an email address. You fund the account with US Postal Money orders, with a daily limit of $1000, never more than $9000 worth of fiat in your CampBX account.
If you stay within those parameters, you need absolutely no verifications, no ID, no nothing. 
When CampBX gets your MO, they deposit it into your account and when you see it there, (usually takes 7 - 10 days from the time you mail,) you can immediately buy at  market and remove the coins to your own wallet, or set up a limit order.
The only way to get cash back out of CampBX is to have them mail you a money order. So if you never intend to sell BTC there, only buy, there is nothing stopping you from putting a fake name and address on the Money order. Just don't make the mistake of sending more than $1000 in a day, cause they'll just mail it back to you. And if they don't really know who you are...
Don't try to buy $3000 or more worth of money orders from the same post office branch on the same day, or they'll ask you to fill out their Know Your Customer forms.

Lots of us are in it to make money, lots of us have *made* money. The guiding principal has been, and continues to be:
**DO NOT** invest any more money than you could afford to loose completely. A 100% loss is "possible."

And for any individual purchase, if the capital gain was $200 or less, it is not reportable. 
That doesn't answer your question about big ticket items though.
Self reporting has been the mainstay of IRS collections for a long time. So you don't report. The blockchain never forgets. So some years into the future, the IRS figures out how to connect Bitcoin address to individuals. If you failed to report, the gov'mnt will do a civil forfeiture on every worldly good you own, and you get a free vacation at Club Fed.

CampBX, a US based Bitcoin exchange, will open an account for you with simply a user name and an email address. You "can" tie your bank to it, but that involves all that ID bullshit.
What is so nice about CampBX, is they take Postal Money orders, up to $1000 per day, $9000 maximum with NO ID bullshit. I'm pretty sure they take Canadian Postal Money orders too. Go to CampBX.com and look around.
It does take about a week, (especially with you being in Canada, it might take longer) for them to get your mail and deposit your money into your account, but then you are set.
Buy your BTC either directly at market, or put up a buy order waiting for the right price. Once your order executes, you can immediately pull them from the exchange into your wallet. The blockchain wallet is OK, but you're better off with either Armory or Electrum (I use Armory, I like it, I know nothing about Electrum except that it is robust, like Armory, and the people using it like it.) DO NOT leave your coins just sitting on ANY exchange, (like coinbase) If you want to spend some, they are easy to move around, and if they are in YOUR wallet, you can manipulate your own level of security, which is not difficult.

Well, we use "bucks" for dollars, came from "sawbuck"
If we use millibit, the problem comes back too soon as Bitcoin grows. I think the best solution for now, is to jump to microbits, or 1/100,000 of a Bitcoin. We would call them "mics", rhymes with Mike's. Mics would be used colloquially, and microbits, or µB would be used formally.
The symbol for "micro" is the Greek letter "µ" available on any English language character map, so it wouldn't be hard to write one thousand mics as µB1000. Until US/English keyboards started being manufactured with the "µ" as a keyed character, microbits could be written simply as uB.
Today, a µB1000 (read as "a thousand mics") is worth about $0.80. Thinking in terms of thousands of microbits would be easy to get your head around. A thousand mics is worth a little under a dollar.

Too late now, you sold them. You owe the tax whether you buy them again or not. And if you bought them with borrowed money, it was a good move to pay the person back.
I *may* sell some coin to recoup  my initial investment, but probably would not do so until that amounts to only 2 - 2.5%. And by that time, I might see Bitcoin as being past the point where it might all go to zero, in which case I would not sell, as my initial investment would be pretty insignificant to the Bitcoin value. I got in at a good time with a good amount of money, I'm happy with what I have and what I did to get there.
To the person outside looking in, wishing they had bought a year ago, it is by no means too late to start now. If you could afford to buy only 5 or 6 coins and sit on them for several years, by all means, do so. It could be your retirement, your kids' retirement and your grandkids' college money, all in one small investment risk you take today.

Well, first off, most redditors are Americans. While this generality won't apply to most other countries, (some are better, some are worse) for the most part, Americans are highly uneducated. Roughly 20% are completely illiterate, unable to read or write their own name, and can only tell the difference between a Stop sign and a Yield sign by the shape and color.
Then there is the next 20% who are functionally illiterate, can't fill out a job app, have trouble reading the menu at Taco Bell.
The next twenty percent get by. They can read at about a 5th grade level. These are the people who post on reddit and can't spell.
The top 40% are educated and literate enough that they don't need to come here and ask how to store their USD soildly. 
And you know, just like police forces don't want cops that are overly intelligent, the 1% are pleased with how the education system they paid for produced the 99%.
And who knows? Maybe OP wants to know not how to accomplish USD "solid" storage, but instead is looking for USD "soiled" storage. But either way, he can't spell.

You can set up an account with CampBX with  no more than a username and an email address. You fund your account with US Postal Money orders that you mail to them. They credit your account when they receive the money order, you can then buy immediately at market or set up a limit order. If you buy, you can transfer your coins to your own wallet immediately. (Be careful of the depth of the sell wall when you buy. CampBX has low volume and you could take out a considerable piece of the sell wall at certain times, causing you to pay more on a "buy now" order than it might have appeared at first glance.)
As long as you don't send more than $1000 a day, you need no ID or age verification AT ALL. Postal Money orders can be purchased in any size up to $1000. If you are nervous about this, buy a $500 one try it out. But I wouldn't be concerned. Tell the teller you want to buy a $1000 money order, and lay down the $1000 and the $1.65 it costs and smile while they print it. Be sure to write your username and email address along the bottom of the money order, and tear off and KEEP the top portion as your receipt should something untoward happen. The replacement guarantee on US Postal Money orders is very good, but you must be able to prove that you bought it, when and who you sent it to were it lost. (When I mail someone a money order, I fold a blank piece of paper into the envelope and place the MO in the folds so that someone can't simply hold the envelope up to the light and see what's inside.)
Buying Postal Money orders require no ID requirements either, unless you try to buy $3000 or more from the same post office branch in the same day, then you get to fill out the Know Your Customer forms.
Granted, this process can take a week to ten days, (last time I did it, the money was in my account within four days of mailing, but I think this was very unusual)
but if you're stuck with this age problem at Coinbase, in ten days you will "still" have this age problem with Coinbase.

Their volume is low because they lost the ability to do ACH transfers of customer money out of the exchange. But the exchange functions well. 
Taking cash out of CampBX I believe is limited to $1000 per day postal money orders that they mail to you. They also  charge $20 for this, and I can see why. It's a PIA for a small company like CampBX.
But I have never heard of a customer being ripped off by CampBX.
Their customer service is slow because the company is just a brother and sister team. I believe they hired someone to do nothing but customer service.
CampBX fills niche in the marketplace that no one else can match. Again, I have not heard of anyone losing money to CampBX. Have you?

Credit Unions can and *do* do everything that a bank can do.
Credit Unions have their advantage in that they are owned entirely by the depositors and most pay out dividends to all owners in proportion to the number of "shares" each depositor holds (savings)
Credit Unions offer loan services (car loans, mortgages, etc) to their members, using the funds of other members, just like a bank does. But their interest rates are *much* lower than banks, because the Credit Union management is not making million dollar salaries, nor are they under pressure from owner/stockholders, (usually bigger banks) to pay enormous dividends from the money they steal from their customers.
Credit Unions also usually belong to nationwide networks of other Credit Unions and members can use their debit cards, and access other banking services nationwide, for free.  They can send and receive money transfers, do online banking and bill pay, etc., etc.

Localbitcoins are extortionist in pricing. Notwithstanding the danger.
The best way to turn BTC into cash is to go to AmagiMetals.com and buy silver bullion with your BTC. (American Silver Eagles probably work best for this) Take the silver (or better yet, keep it. See you at to a COIN STORE, not a pawn shop or a "we buy gold" store. Those two will rip you off as badly as localbitcoins. Any coins store will buy the Silver Eagles for CASH. You will loose about $1.50 per coin in this transaction, but it's a far cry better than localbotcoins, and no one is at risk of being strongarmed.

CampBX, US based accepts several money order type instruments with no more than setting up an account with a user name and email address.
They will accept, by mail, up to $1000USD per day, up to a $9000 limit. No ID or banking documents if you keep to this small scale. You can withdraw BTC immediately on buying.
There is no way to verify the name and address you put on the money order, but I would use a real email address in case something goes wrong, because they have no idea of who you really are.
Western Union? Trip to the UK for money orders? I don't know the UK procedure, but here in the US, I can buy US Postal Money orders without ID unless I try to buy $3000 from the same office on the same day.

There need be no banking info exchanges either. You can fund your CampBX account with US or Canadian Postal Money Orders that you mail to CampBX. It takes about a week (probably longer from Canada) for them to receive your mail and credit your account. Last time I did this, it only took four days.
They'll take up to $1000 per day to a max of $9000 with no further ID requirements. You can buy your coin and remove them immediately upon finding your account credited.
If you are looking for altcoin exchanges that need no documents, I'd recommend vitcurex or Coined Up (needs a googleID to login)
But once you get some cash into CampBX, you can do anything you want with any crpyto without any age requirements or documents.
Yea, I looked at Vault of Satoshi too, but like you, I'm stingy with my banking info.

If you are in the US or Canada, there is an easy and safe way to buy BTC without "anyone's" permission.
Create an account at CampBX.com. All that is required is a user name and an email account. If you never intend to "sell" there, this can be anonymous stuff.
You fund your account with US postal money orders, which can be in any amount up to $1000, cost $1.65 for the full size. If you never intend to "sell" there, they don't even need your real name and real address. That's up to you. In any case, you fill out the money order with your name and address on the right, CampBX's name and address on the left, and put your username and email address across the bottom. Keep the receipt (top part) and mail.
CampBX will accept this in an unverified account as long as you never try to send them more than $1000 in a single day, and your account fiat total never goes over $9000. (No limit on number of coins) They say on their website that receiving your mail and crediting your account takes 7 -10 days, and it usually does. Last time I did this it took four days.
Once your money is in your account, you can immediately buy coins at market and withdraw them to you own wallet (recommended) or place a limit order, and your cash will sit there until the price falls to the point you are hoping for, and the order is filled.
You will hear people occasionally grumbling about slow customer service, (the company is run by a brother sister team) but I've never heard of people loosing fiat or coins dealing with CampBX.
The company lost its bank affiliation a while back, and with it the ability to do ACH transfers for $2. So it's a bit harder to get cash back out now than it was, and this convenience factor is why you see CampBX coins costing a few dollars more than other exchanges.
The only other thing to consider ( I don't know how much money you are looking to spend) is that if you try to buy $3000 or more money orders at the same post office on the same day, they'll ask you to fill out their Know Your Customer forms.
If you give CampBX a fake name and address, DO NOT forget the prohibition against more than $1000/day. If you go over that, they will simply mail the MOs back to you.

You can use GPG for lots of things besides email.
The GPG concept is pretty simple, really. When you install the GPG program, it generates a pair of keys: a public key and a private key. The public key is "derived" from the private key.
So you publish your Public key. There are lots of servers and services that will store Public keys. I have mine stored on the MIT server.
Anyway, the system works like this: You write a message to Bob, and encrypt it using Bob's public key. Bob, having the private key, is the only person in the world that can decrypt that message, using his private key.
This is a very foolproof method for securing messages. The trouble is that most people are too lazy or, sometimes, too intellectually weak to figure out how this works. Not much can be done about either problem.

No one can tell how many coins you have in what wallets, until you start to spend them. Then if you are careless, the wallets you are holding can be revealed.
So if it's your intention to sit on your coins for some years, you'll be in a good position to see which way the wind blows, and decide then how to proceed. 
Besides, you never owe taxes until you spend a coin. Sitting on them and watching their value increase does not expose you to tax liability.

I would tend to listen and consider your arguments, except for the fact that even through the scandals and high profile frauds that we've seen in past months, big business, VC, and wall street firms are working to find an angle to profit from Bitcoin. Adoption is taking place in diverse places all over the world, and although the US and China still drive the market, the market is GROWING. I can't speak to the long term future of Bitcoin, but I know for certain, that we are still very much in the short term.
And while the possibility exists that the price cold drop to $200, I would expect more people to recognize that as the buying opportunity they missed last year, than people like you wringing their hands and sourly proclaiming the end.

There are no reporting requirements for people that buy US minted 22karat American Gold Eagles, or 24k American Gold Buffaloes. 
Go to Amagimetals.com and buy US gold coins with your bitcoin. A thousand Bitcoin buys you about 800 ounces of said gold. Dispose of the gold as you see fit, or just keep it for your kid's futures. You would convert these coins to cash at COIN STORE, not a pawn shop or a "we buy gold" as you needed/wanted to.

This makes no sense. Think about who the government *IS* these days, ( the extremely dollar rich oligarchy that owns the government) and the extremely rich themselves.
If the dollar collapsed, unless all the dollar rich were already dumping enormous amounts of their dollars into bitcoin to protect their assets, which clearly isn't happening, when the shit hit the fan, it will be too late for them to convert dollars to BTC because their dollars won't buy anything.
When the dollar evaporates, there will be a new class of rich. Early BTC adopters will become the Bill Gates', the Warren Buffets, the Waltons, while the formerly rich will sit in their dilapidating mansions nashing their teeth, and asking the government for social services. (Oh, the irony were I to live to see this.)

Paper wallets are fine, but you could loose one or all, or one gets into the wrong hands and your coins are gone.
The best thing you can do is to encrypt your wallet with a REALLY STRONG PASSWORD. Once that is done, you could leave USB drives with your coins on them laying all over town, and you are safe.
Once you have strongly encrypted your wallet, take your wallet.dat file (this is how your computer can identify coins on the blockchain as yours,) (coins *never* leave the blockchain, they live there) rename it to something innocuous, and store it in the cloud. Hotmail's OneDrive, G Mail, doesn't matter, use a few.
You could even further encrypt the wallet.dat file with password protected WinRAR, or Truecrypt, but storing stuff in a bank is asking for trouble, in a world where trouble could be 24 hours away every day.

There is nothing illegal about mining for bitcoins, and your business storage unit that provides electrical outlets would assume that you might use electricity. They provide WiFi so they might assume you would run computers that access the internet. For $40/month, this unit cannot be very big, and it is probably one of many identical units in this setup. I doubt they would have each unit with individual electric meters to monitor your use.
You biggest concern, assuming that the terms of your contract (read it, they put weird unexpected shit in those) do not prohibit unattended use of computers, would be tripping a circuit breaker.
If down the road, they "catch" you and decide you are an uneconomical customer, they might put a new provision in their contract to prohibit something like bitcoin mining. But until they do, go for it.

I agree with the need to get rid of all the decimal places, and for good reasons: too many people don't understand them, and even people that do can easily make mistakes.
But we already have a WORLDWIDE convention for how to handle this. It's simply "µ"  It can be written as µBit or uBit, either pronounced mu-bit.
Language does not work by fiat. It changes through usage, and only through usage. If we simply start talking about mu-bits, it will become the defacto standard, and there will be no confusion with the computer concept of "bit." The only objection I could see is that it's two syllables and too hard to day. But that's just lazy bullshit.
Two syllable currency names are rampant: dollar, euro, peso, ruble, etc. There won't be any confusion, people will just understand that µBit100 (or better, µB100) is 10,000 Satoshis.
And when you see $100, you don't think or say dollars one hundred, you say one hundred dollars. If you saw µB100, you are going to think and say one hundred mu-bits.

While not everyone will consider the suggestion I'm about to propose, I cannot believe that people still subject themselves to the extortionist exchange rate of Localbitcoins to turn BTC into cash.
Go to Amagimetals.com and spend your BTC on silver bullion. (For the purpose at hand, American Silver Eagles are going to be the easiest to convert to USD)
Amagi charges next to nothing to convert your BTC into silver and he converts your BTC at their FULL CURRENT VALUE. Take that silver (or better yet, keep that silver. See you over at to a COIN STORE, not a pawn shop or a "we buy gold" ripoff store.
A coin store will gladly buy your Silver Eagles for CASH MONIES. You will loose about $1.50 a coin over what you bought them for, but this is a DAMNED SIGHT BETTER than how much you will loose using Localbitcoins, and that's ASSUMING that you don't get scammed or robbed in the process.
If you can't find a coin store near you, go to where we silverbugs trade amongst ourselves. You have the choice, generally, of asking for Paypal, Paypal Friends and Family, or US Postal Money orders as accepted payment. Lots of BTC get traded there too, but obviously, that's not why you would be there selling silver.

They say that it takes 7-10 days for them to receive your mail and credit your account. Usually it does. Last time I did this (from US) they had the money on my account in four days.
Once you see the money in your account, you can buy immediately at market and then immediately remove the coin to your own wallet, or make a limit order, where your money sits until the price comes low enough to match your bid.
Opening an account at CampBX requires nothing more than a username and an email address.
I've used them many times and have been happy with their service. Some people grumble that their support can be slow, but I've never heard of anyone loosing coin or fiat dealing with CampBX.

If you are in the US or Canada, there is a good solution that requires NO DOCUMENTS. You create an account at CampBX.com. All that is required is a username and an email address. 
Go to your local Post Office and buy a US Postal Money order. (Pretty sure CampBX accepts Canadian MO's too.) A US Postal Money order can be any amount up to $1000, cost $1.60. Fill in the money order with your name and address on the right, CampBX name and address on the left. Write your username and email that you registered with on the bottom of the Money Order so that CampBX knows whose account to put it in. (They don't know  you from Adam by name, so don't forget this) Remove the top part of the MO as your receipt, AND KEEP IT. Mail it off. (At least fold the MO in half, so you can't hold the envelope up to a light and see what's in it. I usually fold a piece of paper to fit the envelope and put the MO in the folds.)
CampBX will accept up to $1000 per day this way, up to a total of $9000. They say on their site that it takes 7 - 10 days for them to receive your mail and credit your account. It usually does. Last time I did it, it took four days.
Once they credit your account, you can either just buy some BTC at market, or set up a buy order and wait for the price to fall low enough to meet your order. (These days that seems easy, but the price could go up for a while, in which case you would go cancel your buy order and just buy at market.)
Immediately after buying your coin, you are able to ( and certainly *should*) remove your coin to your own wallet.
If you've got feet that can get you to the post office, no parental input, bank account or ID is required for any part of this.
(For anyone else reading this, not to slight the 16 y/o, but when you go to the post office, if you try to buy $3000 or more worth of MO from the same branch on the same day, *THEN* you need ID, as they are going to ask you to fill out their Know Your Customer forms, as required by Our Most Enlightened Federal Legislation called absurdly enough, "The Patriot Act."
Also, dealing with CampBX means you do not have to pay the extortionist rate charged by Localbitcoins, or risk being strong armed and robbed in the dark alley you were dumb enough to meet the seller in.

When you mine, the value of the coin on the day you get it is "ordinary income" and is taxed that year at your normal rate, WHETHER YOU SALE THE COIN OR KEEP IT.
When you *do* go to sell it, you will be taxed again, if it is more valuable than the day you mined it. Short term capital gain if you owned it for a year or less, long term capital gain if you own it at least a year and a day.
@_date: 2014-03-26 03:05:14
In the US and Canada, and I think they've figured out a Great Britain solution, you can buy BTC with Postal Money orders from CampBX. You create an account with simply a user name and email address, you mail them postal money orders, up to a limit of $1000 per day. total of $9000 in your account at any time, and you can do this with NO ID nonsense, no further paperwork. Takes about 7 -10 days for them to receive your money order and credit your account. Last time I did it, they had the money in my account in four days.
Once you have money in the account, you can buy BTC instantly at market and immediately remove them to your own wallet, or you can set up a limit order, and wait for the price to fall to the level you want, and the order is executed. You can sell your BTC for fiat there, but it's a bit more cumbersome and ID intensive.
If you are looking for just a safe way to buy BTC in a relatively anonymous way, this is it.
I've had good service from these people, and while I here occasional grumbling about them, I've never heard of anyone getting ripped off dealing with them.

If you *did* sell some bitcoins, and made some money, it *will* affect your "parent's" tax returns, as they are claiming you as a dependent. If you make over a certain limit, then they cannot claim you as a dependent.
Better get straight with them about this.
As others have said, if you only "bought" coins but did not sell them, you owe no tax yet. Try to own them for a year and a day, at least, before you sell them, lets you claim long term capital gain, much lower tax rate than regular capital gain. Although as a 14 yer old, its unlikely you've made enough money to put you above the bottom tax rate, of 0%. All bets are off though if you *did* make $20-30K or more profit dabbling in bitcoin.
In any case, this must be discussed with your parents, if you sold coins and made money.

Well, it works, mostly, but it is a royal pain in the ass. The coins go into escrow until the seller reports that you've paid. Lots of people get scammed because they don't understand the process.
My biggest beef with localbitcoins is that you will pay outrageous premiums to buy, and suffer terrible price reductions to sell.
I don't like tying my banking identity to any exchange, so I use in the US CampBX. Without ANY ID bullshit, you can create an account with merely a username and a real email address. They will then take $1000 per day deposits of US Postal Money orders, up to an account total balance of $9000. There is no limit to how many or how quickly you can withdraw you BTC.
Some people bitch that CampBX is slow, as the usuall time for them to receive your mail and deposit your money order is 7 - 10 days. However, I just mailed them a $1000 MO on Thursday, and yesterday, Tuesday my account was credited. I bought my BTC, removed them to my own wallet and spent half of them in less than an hour.
I've used this method with CampBX a few times, and I've been very satisfied.
Don't mail more than $1000 a day or they'll just return them to you. And when you go to the post office, if you try to buy $3000 or more at one time at the same branch, you get to fill out their Know Your Customer forms and show ID.

It's ironic, because none of the trades are important to the issue, only the conversion of coin to fiat or merchandise.
Then you use your best guesses. If *you* can't figure it out, no one else will be able to, or interested enough to do the work needed to. There will be an enormous amount of "fudging" on both sides this year.
I would say, since you are trying to be completely above board with all of this, is to compare the amount of coin you started with, and look at how many were converted for cash, and look at the historic charts and pull value vs dates out to best match your best guess. Who could expect more?
It would not be unreasonable, were you to say that over the year you spent say 25 coins, but 16 of those were spent in many small transactions that netted you $200 or less in gain and could be disregarded. Again, who could dispute it?

I'm surprised that I haven't seen this stated before, but there is a real good reason why the price is falling now, and as in every (unmanipulated) market, it is supply vs demand.
There is a good strong reason why lot so people are selling now, driving down the prices. FUCKING TAXES!!!
Everyone who bought coins from Jan 1, 2013 and sold them during the same 2013 year owes the higher SHORT TERM CAPITAL GAINS taxes, and they are selling MORE coins to raise the money to PAY those taxes, although everyone is grumbling about it.
Everyone who sold coins in 2013 that they bought in 2012 or earlier, owes LONG TERM CAPITAL GAINS TAXES that they are selling coins to cover.
But in either case, lots pf people that have been USING coins now are scrambling to raise the money to PAY the tax on them. This rush to sell, sell, sell has only a couple weeks to run and things will turn around.

Convert the USD sitting in GOX to BTC, and get them the hell out of there. Do we have to draw you a picture?
If you need to convert your BTC to cash, first go buy silver bullion from Amagimetals.com. Very reputable dealer, good prices, fast delivery.
After doing so you should consider actually *keeping* the silver, but to sell it for cash quickly at a good exchange rate, take your silver to a COIN STORE, not a pawn shop or a "we buy gold" ripoff.
come over to for any questions.
Amagi is not the biggest dealer, but he is the BEST that takes bitcoin. You'll be happy dealing with him. Stephen Macaskill is his name, in Denver.

Mt Gox, claiming technical difficulty, has "temporarily" completely suspended withdrawls of any sort, so they can fix their technical problems.

Create an account with CampBX if you live in the US or Canada. All you need is a user name and an email address. You need no ID or any kind of paperwork.
They accept US and Candian Postal Money orders, which they credit to your account. If you want to send $79, that's fine with them.
They'll accept up to $1000 per day like this, with a $9000 limit. There is no delay in removing coin, or adding coin to your account.
You have to mail the money order, and they say that it can take 7 - 10 days for them to receive your mail and credit your account, and usually it does. Last time I did this it only took four days.
Whatever you decide to do, stay away from Gox.

Localbitcoins has *always* been a ripoff.
If you need coin regularly, live in the US, Canada or UK and don't like using Coinbase, check out CampBX. It's a small US exchange that accepts orders (almost completely anonymously) by you mailing them US Postal Money orders, maximun allowed without verification documents is $1000 per day, and you are not allowed to ever have more than $9000 in your account at one time. But you can buy as soon as they receive your money order and bank them, average of 7 days, and you can remove some or all of your coin to  your own wallet immediately. 
Their fees are also very low, their BTC price is slightly higher than others at times as CampBX lost ( or never obtained, I forget which) their ability to do ACH transfer, so it's slightly more cumbersome to take fiat out of the exchange. 
But if you are just looking for a reliable place to pull coins from on a reguar basis, check them out.

I'm going to go with btc-e apparently. I want to buy roughly 100 PPC, and hold them indefinitely. I probably won't need to make any other transactions for years.
VoS wants WAY too much info to simply deposit 0.5 BTC, trade for PPC and pull them out, never to need VoS again.

Create an account with CampBX, (in the US) with merely a user name and an email address. Take your $400CAD cash to the post office, buy either a Canadian or US Postal Money order. Put your user name and email address across the bottom of the money order, tear off the top as your receipt. . Mail them the Money Order. In a week or so (maybe ten days) they'll have received your money order and credited your account. Last time I did this, it only took four days, but I'm in the US. As soon as  you see that they've credited your account, you can buy $400 worth of bitcoin (or any amount less, if you prefer) at market and immediately remove them to you own wallet.
No ID or verification nonsense involved. You can do this up to $1000 per day, total fiat allowed in your account at any one time is $9000. More than that then you have to do the verification crap.
There is no limit to how much BTC you can have in your account, but don't leave stuff on *any* exchanges. It's just a bad idea.
Edit: Local bitcoins is *way* too expensive a way to buy. But you probably know that from watching the market?

Fraid not. You have to create a partition on the USB drive. Windows now includes the ability to do this natively, so does Linux. After you do this, Windows will no longer see a USB stick, but a regular partition, like D:\ or E:\, and it will use that partition as if it were actually contained within your hard drive.
I've read that to move the blockchain and still have it work, you have to create a "pointer" ( a symlink? I don't know what it's called) in the folder that bitcoinQT expects to find the chain. Then it will work.
But I can't give you authoritative directions on how to do it.

The Doge coders "thought" that they coded in a cap, and they "intended" to code in a cap. But when people poured over their software it was pointed out that as written, there was no cap. The author then said, 'oh well, fuck it, it can stay the way it is' (in so many words.)

The best thing you could do with that piece of bitcoin is to learn how to manipulate it without losing it.
Put it in a wallet, try a few different wallet clients so you see how they work and you decide which you like best.
Take $3 worth and learn how to put it in cold storage. Move it back and forth. Set up wallets in two different clients and "donate" pieces to your self, just to get used to how it's moved. Practice security.
Put $4 into an exchange and buy some Dogecoin. Move that to a different exchange and buy a piece of Litecoin. Move that to a third exchange and trade back for BTC. Now you have also learned how to mix your own coins.
Then when you think it's time to buy bigger pieces of or multiple bitcoins, you'll know what the hell you are doing, and are very much less likely to make a mistake that costs you big bucks.

I'm getting *REALLY* tired of everyone saying that the Silk Road was the only use for Bitcoin, and all those same people proclaimed that Bitcoin was dead when the Silk Road was shut down.
*NOBODY* points out that when the Silk Road closed, Bitcoin crashed, slightly, and that THREE DAYS LATER things were back to normal with Bitcoin, and what followed was a long period of slow steady growth, right up until the China frenzy and subsequent crash, and Bitcoin survived even that and is daily moving on, doing the Lord's work, so to speak.

CampBX takes US and Canadian postal money orders. I believe they now have a solution for Great Britain too.
You cannot send cash through the mail and expect that it doesn't get stolen. Postal money orders can be refunded if lost or stolen and are an excellent way to buy BTC.
CampBX will let you open an account with no more than a username and an email address. No verifications of any kind AS LONG AS you do not send them anymore than $1000 USD per day, and can have no more than $9000 in your account at any time. (No limit on BTC, but if you are selling them, you are limited to $9000 total, and can only withdraw  your money by Postal Money order, $1000 per day max.)
Mail your money order, it takes, (they say on their website) 7 to 10 days for them to receive your money order and credit it to your account. Last time I did this, it took only 4 days.
Once the money is in your account, you can buy BTC at market and remove it to your own wallet immediately, or you can place a limit order listing the price you want to pay, and your money sits there until the price comes down to that point.
CampBX is tiny, run by a brother and sister team, (they *did* outsource some customer service help within the last several months) but they do a good job. I've never read of ANYONE having their money or coin stolen from CampBX
EDIT: if this isn't anonymous enough for you, I can expound a bit more on what your options are.

People aren't buying a "privilege," they're doing a currency exchange, no different that from dollars to euros. They are motivated to make that exchange because the cryptocurrency does some things better than fiat.
And since some portion of the population has always hoarded part of whatever was money in their culture, (savings) one would expect that some portion of BTC will be held the same way. Bitcoin started with mostly "hoarders" and probably is still mostly "hoarders" but every day that someone "spends" a piece of coins that metric changes. Now that bitcoin exists, and people are starting to see its usefulness, its use is increasing, and will continue to increase to become its own healthy economy. Even once this is done, there will still be "hoarders" but by then we'll stop thinking of them like that.
A steady or slowly increasing value will not prevent spending, just the opposite. If someone wants to do something that is easier with crypto than dollars, they'll buy and use the crypto. If they buy crypto and the price falls, *then* I think they might be reluctant to spend until the price recovers.
I'm an example of both. I have a modest pile of coin that I bought right after the crash in April, last. I bought that coin with the knowledge that I could loose every penny. Still feel that way, and that's OK with me. It was a carefully made decision. The amount of money I spent is not life changing. Those coins will either become worthless, or be my grandchildren's future.
Then I bought some coin recently at around $800 to *use* now. And I used a big chunk of it. But now, I'm reluctant to spend, as every $10 purchase would actually cost me $12 or $13. So I wait.
@_date: 2014-07-13 23:29:06
So open a separate bank account just for this purpose, and regularly move funds out of it.
What could be simpler?
Most likely, he could simply open another account at the bank that you use now. For example, at my bank I have a few accounts. One of those accounts is only to fund PayPal and cover web exposure to my debit card, which I like to use all over. I keep enough in that account to cover those expenses, that's the most I could lose.

If you are able to remove the BTC from Gox, and are in the US, you can simply spend the BTC on silver bullion, then sell the bullion for cash. You can buy silver from Amagimetals.com then sell it to a local coin store, not a pawn shop or a "We Buy Gold" ripoff. To get the best value, you might pre-arrange with the coin dealer what coins he would like to buy, (he'll probably want American Silver Eagles) and negotiate the exchange price.
Were you to buy this silver, one of the best places to try to sell it would be here, on reddit: and You would get best prices here. 
Amagi charges close to no fees (0.023%) exchanging BTC for silver, and reddit's will pay top dollar.
You *could* sell the silver on ebay, but if you're not used to doing that, it's a real pain in the ass.

TigerDirect is a BAD place to spend your money, fiat or BTC.
If TigerDiret offered  you FREE merchandize, you would be wise to refuse.
CampBX.com is a US based exchange that opens accounts with merely a user name and an email address. They accept US or Canadian postal money orders, without any sort of ID/banking verification, up to $1000 per day, $9000 total at any one time.
You mail the money orders, so it takes a few days, but they are dependable, (although support is sometimes slow) and as far as I know, no one has ever lost fiat or coin dealing with them

I've been telling many newbies seeking help to buy from CampBX using money orders, and to sell by buying silver bullion from AmagiMetals, then selling the bullion (if they didn't want to keep it) at COIN SHOPS, not pawn or "we buy gold stores."
This is WAY less expensive than dealing with the extortionist prices of Localbitcoins. Plus there are no scams, and no chance of newbies being physically robbed by unscrupulous "localbitcoiners."

If you are in the US, create an account with CampBX. You don't *NEED* a bank account or anything more than a username and an email address. Without going through verification nonsense and giving up your banking info, you can fund your account with US Postal Money orders, of which CampBX will accept up to $1000 per day, up to a limit of $9000. You have to do this by mail of course, and it takes about a week, but hey, THIS is what you are looking for.
When you go to the Post Office, if you try to buy $3000 or more in money orders at a time, you get the pleasure of filling out their Know Your Customer forms.
Mail the money orders to CampBX in separate envelopes on different days, or they'll just send them back to  you.
You buy your coins outright at market prices, or you place a "buy" order looking for a certain price. Once you own coins you simply remove them to your own wallet, with no restrictions on how many BTC you can move in a day

The US gave up it's gold reserve decades ago. there is no gold in Fort Knox, it's all been converted into private (and/or corporate) hands, and even if that's not true, what does that have to do with wanting to tie BTC to gold?
The US maintains its strength by convincing us that gold has no value, that Federal Reserve Notes are all that matter, and if you object, that the dollar is and always will be the world's reserve currency, and if you object, you'll be looking down the barrel of a gun, or dangling from the end of a rope.

I like your argument, but I find one flaw regarding value vs scarcity.
Bitcoin, and I guess most any altcoin is similar, is not data. You are correct that data is abundant and cheap. Bitcoins are "solutions," not data. They are mathematically entities that are much more than 1 and 0s of "data." These solutions are rare and difficult to find. It is the combination of those solutions being useful as units of exchange and difficult to find that gives an intrinsic value.
And by your definition, they are useful. More so than rocks. And as more people try to make use of them, (hopefully) the demand stays a bit ahead of supply. This way, as long as the value stays somewhat steady or is going up, regardless of how slowly, people *will* be inclined to *use* the coin, and it becomes self re-enforcing.

I have been fortunate, it seems, as all my transacting with CampBX worked as it was supposed to. But obviously I am wrong when I say that no one has lost dealing with them.
I *had* been promoting them as you saw further up in this thread, because my experiences were "as expected."
I guess I can no longer in good conscience continue giving the advice that I was giving. Too bad. It really was nice to have a small exchange that let you do small trades basically anonymously. 
Is there another exchange that lets member do small fiat exchanges without verification and ID nonsense? I can understand the need for that kinda stuff for customers that do multi-thousand dollar transactions, but I don't see the need when someone wants to buy $500 worth of coin.

CampBX exchange, in the US, requires only a username and an email address to open an account. They accept US and Canadian Postal Money orders to fund your account. They will accept up to $1000 per day, up to a total of $9000. 
You mail the money order (with whatever name and address you care to use, as it will never be used unless someday you want this account to SELL Bitcoin.) to CampBX and they credit your account with the funds. They say that it takes 7-10 days to receive your mail and credit your account. Last time I did this it took four days. Being in Canada, your mail is going to take longer to get there.
The MOMENT you see that they've credited your account, you can spent it all buying Bitcoin and immediately move the coin to  your own wallet. No waiting.
But all you will ever need to fund your account, login to your account, and remove coin from your account is that username and email address. There also is no "verification" email involved, but it might be a good idea to make a new email a real one so you can contact them if something goes wrong. Also, for the same reason, hang on to the stubs from the money orders until you see your funds in your account.
Edit: If you are really paranoid, be sure to only log into the CampBX website while using a VPN. I doubt that they are going to check, but if you intend to send Canadian money orders, you might want to use a Canadian IP with that VPN. If you are using a bogus address on the money order, be sure to NOT send more than $1000 in one envelope, or more than one envelope per day, because their procedure is to just mail it back to you.

You never send cash to ANYONE in the mail.
Take your cash to a local Post Office. Tell the Clerk "I'd like to buy a $XXX money order ($1000 or less in the US, don't know about Canada) Anyway, they take your money, run a blank money order form through their machine and it prints out on it the value and the date. It has two sides, and a tear off portion (your receipt) at the top. You put your name and address on the right side (sender), and put CampBX's name and mailing address on the other side. You write your CampBX user name and email address along the bottom of the money order, tear off and KEEP the receipt portion, put the rest in an envelope and mail it to CampBX. The money orders in the US cost $1.60 for a $1000. Your fees will be comparable, I'm sure. (When I send a money order or a check in the mail, I always take a blank sheet of paper, fold it, and put the MO in the folds so that someone cannot hold the envelope up to a light and see the Money Order inside.)
In the US, I don't need to show any ID unless I ask to buy $3000 or more worth of money orders at once. Which you *can* do if you want. You can march in and buy $10,000 worth of money orders if  you want, but you are going to be filling out some other government forms, so avoid this.
Even if you have to show a driver's license or something to buy a Canadian Money order, don't worry about it, people do this shit every day, nobody thinks anything about it.
Not sure about this, but I think I read somewhere that Canadian Post Offices can sell you both Canadian MO or US MO. Probably doesnt matter. Read the deposit rules for CampBX, I'm fairly certain they take Canadian MO too.

 I expect to be dead, and while I intend that my heir has access, I don't want access to all the coins available at once, or I feel they'll be squandered away.


My heir *already* has the encryption key, as I could die tonight, and he would loose all otherwise. I trust the strength of my key, and my coins are now spread over four wallets. Partly for the possibility of a key being compromised, I'd like to spread those coins over a few dozen wallets. Then make each so it won't open until a given date. Once that date passes, I realize there is no way to guard against a stupid error by a careless heir, or a wasteful one.

Go to AmagiMetals.com and buy silver bullion. American Silver Eagles, specifically. (Silver Eagles will be in demand at ANY coin shop you take them to be sold.) He takes bitcoins for almost no fee. He also ships fast. Denver to Louisiana you probably have them Wednesday, Thursday latest. 
Take these silver coins to a COIN SHOP, not a pawn shop or a "we buy gold" (both of these are worse than localbitcoins.) 
Amagi has a really great price on the American Eagles right now, and you take them to a coin shop and sell for cash. A coin shop will pay you about $1.50 less each coin than you paid, but it will be quick and easy.
Here:  
If you do what I'm suggesting, you won't see the bitcoin option until you are checking out, but it's there.
Edit: Show your mechanic what you are doing, show him what the silver is worth,  Let him look at a couple of online silver bullion dealers, like ProvidentMetals.com, or APMEX.com, again to see what they would cost him to buy, and he may choose to take silver from you as payment, instead of Federal Reserve Notes, saving you the trip to the coin store to sell your Eagles.
If you can afford it, buy some silver for yourself and stash it away for a rainy day. See for support

But with all the big money that has recently been pouring into Bitcoin business, this will be managed as simply a bump in the road.
Hang tough.

I acquired all my coins from Bitfoor, and CampBX, before it became "funky."
Coinbase and Bitpay still the two major ways vendors redeem the coins that they take in for USD?
I'm  not a vendor, so I don't need accounts with either company.
But what is "the state of the art" right now, (I don't pay that close attention) for we consumers to buy coins with our USD and sell coins to get USD back? I had thought that Bitstamp was a good place for this, but they seem to have had some major problems, who knows if they'll be back.
But if I wanted a convenient service *other* than coinbase, what options are there today? (Localbitcoin is not a good option, never has been.)
I would never submit to coinbase's demand. I'm not asking them for credit, and although I never opened an account with them, I'm sure that those of  you who did had to jump through major hoops to get an account. This is going too far.
@_date: 2014-06-01 21:45:18
If you are in the United States, use CampBX. I've written this up so many times, I'm not going to today.
Go to their website and read about it. They take US postal money orders with no ID requirements within very liberal parameters. All you need is a user name and am email address. If you never intend to sell there, you can even make up what little they want in the way of credentials.
@_date: 2014-02-04 06:19:02
I didn't write this for you, but I get tired of rewriting it all the time, so not every phrase will apply to you, but here's what you do:
If you are in the US or Canada, there is a good solution that requires NO DOCUMENTS. You create an account at CampBX.com. All that is required is a username and an email address.
Go to your local Post Office (with as little as ten or twenty dollars if you wish) and buy a US Postal Money order. (Pretty sure CampBX accepts Canadian MO's too.) A US Postal Money order can be any amount up to $1000, cost $1.60. Fill in the money order with your name and address on the right, CampBX name and address on the left. Write your username and email that you registered with on the bottom of the Money Order so that CampBX knows whose account to put it in. (They don't know you from Adam by name, so don't forget this) Remove the top part of the MO as your receipt, AND KEEP IT. Mail it off. (At least fold the MO in half, so you can't hold the envelope up to a light and see what's in it. I usually fold a piece of paper to fit the envelope and put the MO in the folds.)
CampBX will accept up to $1000 per day this way, up to a total of $9000. They say on their site that it takes 7 - 10 days for them to receive your mail and credit your account. It usually does. Last time I did it, it took four days.
Once they credit your account, you can either just buy some BTC at market, or set up a buy order and wait for the price to fall low enough to meet your order. (These days that seems easy, but the price could go up for a while, in which case you would go cancel your buy order and just buy at market.)
Immediately after buying your coin, you are able to ( and certainly should) remove your coin to your own wallet.
If you've got feet that can get you to the post office, no parental input, bank account or ID is required for any part of this.
(For anyone else reading this, not to slight the 17y/o, but when you go to the post office, if you try to buy $3000 or more worth of MO from the same branch on the same day, THEN you need ID, as they are going to ask you to fill out their Know Your Customer forms, as required by Our Most Enlightened Federal Legislation called absurdly enough, "The Patriot Act."
Also, dealing with CampBX means you do not have to pay the extortionist rate charged by Localbitcoins, or risk being strong armed and robbed in the dark alley you were dumb enough to meet the seller in.
Now that you own a piece of a bitcoin, sign up with a trading exchange. I recommend vircurex because, like CampBX, it requires no documents or ID, just an email address and a password (make it a good one) to protect your account. Like with bitcoin on CampBX, any other currency that you buy in vircurex, move it out to your own wallet.

I have a stack of credit cards. Each company, of course, vetted me before giving me CREDIT. My bank does not give me credit, (except through VISA, but VISA does the checking.)
Coinbase, as I remember when they started was draconian enough in their quest to Know Thou Customer before giving out accounts. Coinbase isn't offering credit services, and I doubt anyone is ASKING them to. Credit checks, like using your Social Security number for purposes OTHER than getting Social Security benefits are things that are morphing into areas that they weren't designed for.
I will not, would not submit to a credit check for a service like Coinbase.  They can kiss my fat hairy ass. ;P

Go to  and buy silver, spend more than $100 and use the code "PrincessBride" at checkout and get free shipping. I don't know how long the promotion lasts.
But you get full current value of your bitcoin, minus a 1% fee. Either keep the silver (which is a good idea) or take it to a Local Coin Shop (not a pawn shop or a "We Buy Gold" ripoff store) and sell to them, they will pay no less than $1 under spot. Be firm, they could buy at 50 cents under and still make a profit.
If you can't find a store to give you good value, go to and we'll take care of you.

You can open an account on CampBX with simply a user name and an email address.
You fund your account with US postal money orders, bought at any post office for $1.65 for the maximum amount of $1000. You can buy two at a time, but if you try to buy $3000 or more, you get to fill out the post office's Know Your Customer forms, ID required.
CampBX will accept $1000 per day, in the mail, (different envelopes mailed on different days) and credit your account without any ID requirements. (so make a new email)
You buy your coins and remove them to your address and then go live your life.
CampBX is supposedly setting up $2 in and out bank account transfers, but obviously then, you need to ID yourself.
If you "really" want to increase your anonymity, only log into CampBX through a VPN so they can't connect you to a certain IP.

I think the easiest way to get a large amount of BTC converted without dealing with exchanges is to use the BTC to buy precious metals, then sell them as you like, with little fuss or regulatory nonsense.

CampBX lets you open an account with just an e-mail address. They let you fund that account with postal money orders, as long as you don't deposit more than $1000 per day, there is no ID requirement.
The name and address you put on the money order is up to you. Has no bearing on your account anyway if all you want to do is buy coins and remove them. Your real ID would only come into play if you tried to take USD back out of your account. 
Keep the money order stub and don't be stupid with the info you submit.

If you are only interested in buying BTC and not cashing them out, check out CampBX. They let  you open an account with just a user name and an email address, no ID required.
To this account you can deposit a max of USD1000 per day, (use separate envelopes and mail on different days) and can accumulate a max of USD9000.
You can buy coins (CampBX has one of the lowest buy costs around) and remove them to your own wallet, without any further ID nonsense.
They accept Canadian postal money orders, among a few other cash deposit methods. I don't know how the Canadian money order purchase works, but in the US, I can buy MO up to $1000 for $1.65, and I can buy two at a time. If I try to purchase $3000 or more at one time in the same post office, I get to fill out their Know Your Customer  forms, and must present and ID.
If you really want to be anonymous, be creative in listing your name and address on the money order, and only connect to CampBX through a VPN. It's not like they need to mail you checks or anything, if all you want to do is buy coins and remove them.

In my mind, BoA is corporate scum of the lowest, foulest variety.

Proving silver is real is pretty simple. You measure the Specific Gravity. For coins, you know what the proper weight is, and if the weight is wrong, then that's as far as you need to go, but if the weight is correct, you measure the Specific Gravity to be sure you have a troy ounce of silver and not something like a silver plated troy ounce of copper.

They work buy reacting to the presence of starch. You know, that long chain of glucose molecules? Apparently a large portion of funny money is made of paper that is treated with starch after printing to give it more "heft" when trying to pass it. The iodine reacts to the starch showing a dark color. If there is no starch, you get the light brown/yellow iodine color that is reversed in a few minutes by the hydrogen peroxide.
What it means when the pens shows "legit" is that there is no starch present. Like regular copy paper, or skin.
If you have nothing to do someday, spray a bill with Niagara spray starch, go to Wal-Mart and "spend" the bill. All hell will break loose, and you'll be detained until the Secret Service gets there, and they look at the money and proclaim it real. You get a chuckle and get to go home.

The list of PM dealers that accept bitcoin is great! I only knew of a couple, but I see that converting BTC to PM is a lot more generalized than I knew.
Even if you want to sell your BTC for fiat, using PM as an intermediary is a great idea. You buy the PM at the going BTC rate, with no huge slice taken out like a localbitcoin deal involves, and you can easily sell the PM for fiat, at spot price, (in other words, no fees) at any coin shop or most jewelry stores. Watch that spot price though. There is no reason to sell your PM for any significant amount below spot.

Go to  and buy silver, spend more than $100 and use the code "PrincessBride" at checkout and get free shipping. I don't know how long the promotion lasts.
But you get full current value of your bitcoin, minus a 1% fee. Either keep the silver (which is a good idea) or take it to a Local Coin Shop (not a pawn shop or a "We Buy Gold" ripoff store) and sell to them, they will pay no less than $1 under spot. Be firm, they could buy at 50 cents under and still make a profit.
If you can't find a store to give you good value, go to and we'll take care of you.

While this company's prices look to be slightly better than some others, their shipping on orders under $5k is not.
I cannot find *anywhere* on their site telling me where these people are, or if they are even in the US. They reference some "Veldt, LLC" in their TOS, but I can't find anything about that company either.
ALSO, the main thrust of that article seemed to be that this Agora was both a "major" bullion dealer, of which I can find no evidence, and they claim to be "the first" to take BTC.
I don't know who was really first, but I know that AmagiMetals.com accepts BTC, and I've dealt with them. They seem cool, and the owner, Stephen Macaskill has a pretty good philosophy. (Even if he does drop reviews of his own company here and there. *I'm looking at* you *Stephen*)

If I had 5k invested, that would be 5k that I was prepared to risk in its entirety, that 5k was not enough money to make a real difference in my life if I lost it all. Even when it becomes *worth* $100,000, I *still* only have 5k at risk. That's the downside.
The upside is that the 5k could become my son's retirement fund, with more than enough left over that it provides for his kids all their lives. The trick is to let it grow, and while you *can* spend some, never let its total value stop growing. 
This is how new money becomes old money.

So then everything you ever buy has to be bought local. No shipping, no mailing addresses. 
I think you might be overplaying the bitcoin anonymity thing. Bitcoin might be, or made to be, more traceable than we want.
Even if it were anonymous, there is that shipping address thing. What is happening with the idea that Amazon was going to open locations with "lockers" that you could have things shipped to? Then perhaps with bitcoin and a fake name you "might" be able to buy things safely?
Hiding from "the man" is difficult. You smarter than all the spooks working at the NSA? Making your phone calls without your phone company ratting you out?
There's a lot to think about. Can you use PGP encryption tools? We need to use encryption routinely, for mundane things, so that the people who "need" encryption can hide in the mountains of mundane encrypted messages. You need to instill a cultural change in the way we communicate.

I had heard of bitcoin almost from the start, was aware of some of the problems it was having a couple of years ago.
Several weeks ago I noticed that Bitcoin had climbed to $25 and I thought it was time to give it a close look.  I didn't.
I came back a couple weeks ago and saw the price at $85 and started spending hours a day learning everything I needed to invest. I am now moving money into a couple of exchanges so that I can buy. I'll be ready in a couple of days.
I think the events in Cyprus of the last couple of weeks  history will show to be a watershed moment in the world of banking and finance. Things will *never* be the same. My opinion is this is going to make Bitcoin the "go to" place for lots of the world's money, (especially southern europe) So I think now *is* the time for Bitcoin.
But the last two weeks have seen *exponential* price rises. Exponential events aren't sustainable. While I might now be "ready" I have no intention of putting my dollars at such incredible risk.
I'm gonna wait and watch. For one thing, I intend to do the thing that is bad for bitcoin, and that's to hoard what I buy, hoping to watch it increase in value. If bitcoin shows that it can maintain its value, I'll reconsider. But I suspect there is a big crash coming. It's just a matter of when.

Assuming that you are in the US, and you know that you want these in a week or two, probably the least hassle and most secure thing is to create an account with CampBX, mail them a US Postal Money order, (they cost $1.60 each and can be had up to a $1000 maximum size) wait the several days that it takes for CampBX to receive your mail and post the money to your account. As long as you don't try to add more than $1000 per day, there are no ID hassles at all.
Once your money is in your account, you can make your buy at your leisure, and remove the BTC, again, at your leisure, to an address that your bitcoin wallet of choice will provide for that purpose.
You could leave a balance of dollars in your account, or spend every penny, as you like.
I have heard of no one getting scammed using CampBX, only complaints that their site can be slow, due to growing pains that they are working to correct.
Edit: Moving BTC into your account is just as easy, but selling them and getting the USD back out is more complicated, but that isn't the issue you have now.

Precedent or not, if those coins "were" Coinbase's, they were there because Coinbase fucked up. OP did what we are supposed to do, that is to *not* leave coins on an exchange. He saw he had a balance, and responsibly removed them.
Six months later Coinbase has an issue? This is not a slam dunk for Coinbase. OP should be polite, but firm in asking them to prove why they feel he stole from them. It's not criminal fraud just because Coinbase says it is. And even if it were, to get this from a civil court to a criminal court means Coinbase has to convince a prosecutor of such. Coinbase can't just march into court shouting "criminal fraud."

The worldwide exposure that the China BTC explosion brought will be shown to be very effective. While I was happy to see my BTC appreciating so quickly, I knew it couldn't last, I knew that such fast growth was *too* fast. It couldn't be sustained, as we've now already seen. 
But I don't expect that it will crash much lower, as worldwide, especially now in Korea and India, people have noticed what BTC is, and demand will continue, just slower than 10 day ago. Even in the US, demand and usuage will probably accelerate, now that Bitcoin is on so many new people's radar.
It will hit $1000 again, but it might take a year. But next time it gets there, it'll stick, because so many more people will be regularly using it.

That's true, you don't know how much bigger it can get. And it may crawl for a while, certainly it will continue to experience ups and downs.
It has grown so much and is growing so quickly because it is becoming mainstream.

All this is happening on the ownership side while on the merchant/retail side, there is a matching explosion of places to spend BTC, making them more and more useful everyday.
This is not tulips. Bitcoin is growing exactly because people are seeing it and using it as money. That is all that it takes to actually *be* money.

Without addressing the ethical issue here, look at the practical.
Six months ago those three coins were worth maybe $300? Even at today's value, it's $1200.
Coinbase is going to take you to court and accuse you of theft? How are they going to prove it. As discussed above, those coins could have come from anywhere. But coinbase is prepared to go to court and fight to prove you defrauded them. That's going to be a hard and expensive argument to make in front of a judge. For $300 or $1200?
It ain't happening.
You don't have to prove how those coins got there, but Coinbase would have to prove the coins were theirs.
If you don't want to give them back, take that approach. They want to claim you owe them a debt. Ask them for proof that you owe them this debt. This is always the right of someone suffering the actions of debt collection.
I would politely assert to them that you disagree with their accusation, and ask them to show you proof that you owe them anything. If they're going to sue you, they're going to have such proof or get laughed out of court.
If they come up with "evidence" that you think would be convincing, then ask what they want to do to resolve the issue. I would *not* offer today's value. 
If you think that they might really sue you, and that their case would hold water, offer $300. Coinbase will jump at that instead of taking the expense of actually going to court on the *chance* they could get more.

Crypto currencies are here to stay. Now that the idea is out there and working for the world to see, the advantages over fiat are just too great.
Bitcoin could fail but the concept would live on. In fact, if Bitcoin could integrate the Proof of Stake in a timely manner, There would be no stopping it. But the PoS idea is still too obscure.
Promoting Peercoin might do the trick, I don't know. There certainly is room in the marketplace for more than one coin, so I'm not conceding the whole network benefit to BTC, the network effect can transfer to other coins proven superior. *This* has been the *real* risk to Bitcoin for a while now.

Basically, yes.


The USB key is good for this. Go to the offline machine, move coin from the cold storage wallet to an active one, take the USB key back to the online machine. If you read the "help" in Armory, it tells you how to do these cold storage operations. Bascially, your private key is only on the cold storage machine, so any transaction you want to make must be "signed" with the private key then taken back to the online machine's watch only wallet and broadcast to the network, where it will get picked up and moved for you.


Usually. Depends on the size of the transaction and what you intend for the new coins, how quickly you want to spend them. With a strong passcode, your active wallet is *very* secure, you don't have to lay awake at night staring at the ceiling worrying about it, more so if you are keeping the active wallet yourself.


You're mixing apples and oranges here. Safety due to strong passcodes is not the same as safety in anonymity, besides, BTC aren't as anonymous as some people think, especially once you start spending from a certain wallet. Good security here is to *never* use the same address twice, and even that isn't foolproof. Unless you're a drug lord or terrorist, don't worry about it. You're not that important.

I don't see anyone else anywhere making the connection that I'm about to describe, but I personally would not have anything, fiat or BTC on deposit with Bitstamp.
Slovenia, the country where Bitstamp does its banking, is in a world of hurt financially. As a holdover from Soviet times, Slovenian banks are mostly State owned. Slovenia is drowning in a sea of debt and bad loans. If you remember what happened recently in Cyprus, (look it up if you don't know what I'm talking about,) Slovenia is in that kind of trouble. Compared to other Slovenian companies, Bitstamp probably looks like a prime jewel to the government. It would be a big blow to Bitcoin to loose Bitstamp, but I really believe it is very much at risk. The idea that the Slovenian banks might face imminent confiscation was not mine.
The thing is, when something *does* happen here, there won't be any advance notice.

The only reason people are willing to mine with ever increasingly costly hardware,  IS the increasing acceptance. As more people try to buy the small amount of the 12 million coins in existence, THAT ARE FOR SALE at exchanges, the demand drives up prices.
If tomorrow China and the US came out and said "Anyone using or owning bitcoins are now criminals," the value would fall to almost nothing overnight, and there would not be a single additional fancy mining rig sold anywhere in the world.

Nothing beats a paper wallet, at least as far as cyberspace goes.
Paper wallets are *very risky* if they fall into someone else's hands that know what it is.
In my opinion, and what I do is as follows:
Using a strong client like Armory, encrypt your wallet with a very strong password, but one that there is no chance you'll lose or forget.
Find the wallet.dat file of that encrypted wallet and make a copy to the desktop (leaving the installed one alone). Change the name of the file to something innocuous, again, something you will not forget, (like "Favorite Vogon Poetry") then archive that file with WinRAR, password protected with a second very strong password. Now take that WinRAR archive and put it in a few other places, a USB drive, but more importantly, in the cloud (offsite) in  your Skydrive, Gmail, Dropbox, whatever you use. But this way, were your computer to die suddenly, or your house burnt  down and your USB stick got a little too hot, you have lost nothing.
WinRAR, by the way, has incredibly robust encryption for its time. And built into WinRAR by design is the inability to rapidly try different passwords. The process is purposely very slow.
And to more precisely answer your question about keeping them on your machine, use something more robust than just qt. And if your encryption password is strong enough, you could leave USB sticks with the program all over town, boldly labeled as to what it was, and nobody is going to get your coins.

Everyone seems to think that a USB stick is forever, or that it can't be lost.
Use a USB stick if you like, but also encrypt your wallet with a strong password, then take your wallet.dat file, copy it to your desktop, change it's name to something innocuous, archive it with password protection with WinRAR, and store a copy of that in the cloud. Dropbox, G-mail, Outlook, whatever you use.
This way when the USB stick gets lost, or just stops working, (both of which happen to people regularly) or your house burns down, or gets washed out in a flood, you will still have a backup

Don't leave your coin just sitting there. Pull it out of the exchange and put it in your own wallet. If you decide to sell it someday, putting it back on the exchange is close to trivial. But while it sits there, you are vulnerable to loosing your coin from hacking theft, or if CampBX were forced to close, or closed voluntarily.

This is the best info I've seen so far regarding Bitcoin and taxes:
Probably your biggest liability would be if you had $10,000 or more in a foreign account and did not report that. This needs reported "outside" of regular IRS tax filings.
Big big penalties if you're caught, no big deal to make the report.
If you cash out after holding the BTC for a year or less, you owe short term capital gains tax, which is taxed at your regular rate, depending on your bracket.
If you hold them for more than a year (even a day) then they become long term gain, and that is taxed at 0%, 15% or 28%, I believe, depending on  your total declared income. I believe, but haven't found it to be 100% sure yet, that if your total income (regular work bullshit and your capital gain) is under $37k, the rate you pay is zero.
But watch the foreign account reporting requirement.
And **DO NOT** leave your coins on any exchange, keep them yourself.

Suppose that I have USD in a bank as a savings account, and say that I have USD somewhere as a retirement account.
When I need toilet paper, I go to the store and purchase with USD. That purchase didn't have anything to do with the savings and retirement accounts, did it?
I'll get more USD next week as my paychek, or my business profit, or my shareholder dividends come in. I'll have more USD to buy beer with, or whatever.
Now I have a couple dozen BTC hoarded away, hoping to make me rich, but that doesn't stop me from using BTC to buy things with. BTC are readily available, and I can replace the BTC I used to buy toilet paper so I could then go buy beer.
As long as BTC are available to aqcuire, through exchanging USD, or a new ecconomy that pays me in BTC, I can both SPEND BTC, and SAVE them. Because while I do hope that my hoarded BTC increase in value, I am astute enough to understand that my BTC only have value if everyone spends them, in addition to trying to save them.

You need to buy the money orders $2000 at a time, over three days, or $2000 at a time from three different post offices.
Then you must mail these to CampBX in separate envelopes over several days, otherwise you reveal your criminal nature and the illegally obtained cash you are trying to launder. Stupid terrorist.

localbitcoins charges a fortune to buy and rips you off badly when you sell.
Go to CampBX. They take US Postal Money orders, $1000 a day with no ID requirements AT ALL. You create an account with a user name and email address. No documents, no verification.
You can add $1000 a day to a max of $9000. BTC can be added or removed with no muss or fuss.
If you never intend to sell BTC for USD, there would be no reason for CampBX to send you any mail, so you can be creative when filling out the "from" side of the money order.
Postal Money orders are $1.65 for $1000, if you try to buy $3000 in one day at the same post office, you need to produce ID and fill out their Know Your Customer forms. Otherwise, not.
It *does* take several days for CampBX to receive your mail and credit your account, but hey, you can't have everything.
And as far as buying BTC, CampBX consistently has about the lowest BTC price around. It's a small exchange still. Great place to buy BTC, maybe a mediocre place to sell.

I will say this about using flash drives. First off, they will eventually fail same as any other physical media. (Remember all the hype about how long the CDs and DVDs we were burning were going to last?) You will be trusting that you have a safe backup, then some years down the line you put the stick into your machine and.....
Secondly, I have several flash drives sitting on the desk in front of me. I have "lost" that many of them over the past several years, or however long they've been around. Yours will get lost eventually too, especially as you are going to make some effort to "hide" them.
And lastly, consider what someone might think about your flash drive, should they find it. You probably won't have much else, if anything, other than your keys on it. Might that stroke the curiosity of the finder as to what you might have stored there? You probably have friends, acquaintances, co-workers that you might talk bitcoin to. How much of a stretch would it be that the finder suspects what they found?
I think the mere 'physicality' of a flash drive is more a risk than a feature.

Firstly, get your head around the idea that all bitcoins never exist anywhere except in/on the blockchain. All we have to use are "markers" (addresses) that describe where on the chain your bitcoins exist. When you sell some BTC, or spend some, part of your markers are given to someone else.
Your record of those markers, and how many of them there are is what you store in your "wallet." The wallet is just a piece of software that basically keeps the small database describing your coins.
Your wallet can be part of someones website, or exchange, like coinbase or MtGox (god forbid) or the wallet can be in a program that you have on your own machine. Having the wallet on your own machine is much safer than not, but having it hosted somewhere can make it more accessible, easy to spend from when you want to do that. (Most people feel that the added ease of use is not at all justified because of the added risk of loss, when the wallet is not in your "pocket," so to speak. I agree with this.
Having a strong passcode, (strong encryption) makes your wallet safer wherever it is, but is still safest in your own hands. The nature of the bitcoin encryption system is such that your passcode could allow access to your wallet by anyone that has it, through a number of different software wallets, (they are similar because they all have to access the same blockchain and recognize your passcode however it is presented.) 
So while there are different places to leave your wallet, and different wallet "programs," all that matters is your passcode. THIS is what you must keep secure. (When people talk about paper wallets, this is just a different representation of your passcode.)
When you are hosting your own wallet, the part that has the secret stuff in it is the file "wallet.dat." If you want to back up your wallet, all you need is that file. The rest of the program can be erased from ANY machine, and that wallet.dat file will enable ANY wallet program to reconstruct and access your coins.
So writing/knowing your passcode, having a paper wallet, and having a safely stored copy of your wallet.dat file are all the same, as far as "backup" is concerned. I trust my strong passcode enough that I feel I could leave USB keys with my wallet.dat all over town, and my Bitcoins would remain safe. But let's not tempt fate.
A paper wallet is good if you can trust that YOU won't loose it, (like in a fire) or that no one else can find it either.
I place the most trust in copying my wallet.dat file, changing its name to something innocuous that only you know, archiving it AGAIN with a passcode like a WinRAR protected archive, and then placing copies in the cloud. Your Skydrive, your Gmail, your dropbox, whatever you like to use, but you need to have copies offsite, cause USB keys that you keep and trust will 1) get lost 2)eventually break as does any hardware or 3)become destroyed as in a fire. So offsite IS A MUST.
As far as which wallet to use, I prefer Armory. Others prefer Electrum. I have no experience with Electrum, so I  have no reason to disparage it. I don't know anything about personal wallets outside of those two.
Strong passcodes mean using LONG stretches of mixed upper and lowercase letters, numbers and symbols. A passcode (that isn't simply dictionary words) of 20-25 or more characters is essentially unassailable. But remember it, remember it well, because if YOU loose it, you've lost your bitcoins forever.

While the bitcoin ride is pretty exciting right now, it *is* a risky place to have money right now.
I would suggest 1/3 in BTC and 2/3 in silver bullion. And bullion that you physically hold, outside of a bank or safety deposit box. 5 years is a good time scale for both venues.
But get it out of the US financial system. There are so many vultures sitting and watching America's retirement accounts, staying awake at night trying to scheme the way to steal it all. 
This would be only one way that this theft would occur, but after the Cyprus bank "bail-in," the EU, Britain, Canada and the US have ALL formalized in regulations as to how "bail-ins" would happen to all of us.

It's people thinking the US is going to default, the whole world is about to burn down, and Bitcoin will rise from the ashes to rule the world.
BTC is likely to go up until the default threat ends, or it happens and the world only smolders without bursting into flames. Then it will come back down.
But hopefully not *all* the way back down. BTC needs little growth spurts here and there. It brings BTC to the attention of more and more people, and this leads to more use, and a general increase in value.

Well, years ago I dealt with tigerdirect for everything. Every machine I built was with parts sourced from them. Everything.
However, over time I began to see their customer support to be either completely uninformed, or downright deceptive. I was spending lots of money with them, and I didn't need that bullshit.
Final straw was when I bought a POS MB from them that was free after rebate. Tiger had replaced (overlaid) the label and UPC code panel on the box with their own, then denied me the rebate because I didn't submit the "correct" UPC label. It was a complete and purposeful fraud.
That's when I discovered Newegg. Since then I've spent thousands and thousands of dollars with Newegg, and turned on the people that respected my knowledge and opinion to Newegg.
Tiger's ploy to cheat me out of a $50 rebate has cost them an *incredible* amount of business. Just the thought of Tigerdirect makes my blood boil.
So to anyone here still paying attention, in all the spirit of the holidays, with all the bile and bloody phlegm I can muster to spit at them, HEAR ME:

The info you need to access your coins is in the "wallet.dat" file, and it is kept in a different folder than Armory itself. You can uninstall and reinstall and the new installation will know where to look for the wallet.dat file.
Also, you should have the wallet encrypted within the Armory client itself, and another good back up method is to find your wallet.dat file, make a copy to your desktop, rename it, then archive it in a password protected WinRAR file, store that in your Skydrive, or Gmail or whatever cloud storage you use.
Then delete the desktop copy, purge your trashcan, and sleep well.

CampBX is a small exchange, but they have a few very nice advantages. To open an account, all you need is a user name and email address.
You can fund your account several ways, but if you use US Postal Money orders, there are no ID requirements, no verification nonsense as long as you don't try putting in or taking out more than $1000 per day into your account. And  you can't have more than $9000 cash in your account. It does take several days for them to receive your mail, and put the money in your account, but there have been VERY FEW people complaining about them. They are basically a two person operation, so customer service tickets can take a while, but they get it done.
You can buy BTC there and take them out immediately, I think 500 coin per day is the limit. If you are only interested in buying, CampBX consistently has the lowest buy prices of just about any exchange, I guess because of their small volume. Their limit orders work quite well, so if you can't access their site during a period of insane activity, your limit orders get filled in the background regardless.
There are several methods of withdrawing cash, a return money order ($20 fee) and an ACH transfer, ($2 fee)
If you want to bother with verifications, you get higher limits and more options for moving money in and out. But without *ANY* ID nonsense, you can get quite a bit done with CampBx's platform.

It might take days or weeks if you are trying to move many thousands at once, but smaller amounts of a few grand or less is relatively easy, and quick (24-48 hours)
Register an account with Bitfloor, tell them you want to wire money and how much, and they'll give you "a to the penny amount" and an account number that identifies your wire as "your" wire.
Take that info to your bank and buy a wire transfer, gonna cost you $15 or so, and Bitfloor's bank charges you another fee to receive it. Shows up in your Bitfloor account 24-48 hours after your bank sends it.
$30 in fees isn't too unpalatable if you're sending a couple of grand, but it might be a lot to stomach if you were only sending a couple of hundred.
But it is easy.
After doing the first one, and seeing how the bank fills out the paperwork, I can do it by email. I print the form, fill it out, scan it as a .pdf and email it to my bank manager. Quick and easy.
There is no ID hassles unless you want to take cash back out. They will send you a direct deposit (with no fee) to your bank account, but there you have to have proved who you are (send a pic of a gov't ID) That probably takes a few days.

NEVER put it all in an online wallet.
Keep a few coins there for ease of spending, but keep the vast majority of your hoard in your own hands, at least, and best plans is to keep them in cold storage.
Once you know what you are doing pulling coins out of cold storage when you need them is very simple.
In fact even leaving a few coins in Coinbase is too high of a risk. the only reason to *put* coins there is to convert them back into USD. Well, if you need to convert, *then* put coins there. Moving these things around is absolutely trivial. It's one of the best feature of Bitcoin.

There are no ID requirements for depositing $1000 or less a day, up to $9000, their buy price is consistently cheaper than most other exchanges, and although it takes several days to get started, cause you have to mail them a postal money order, (if you want to stay anonymous) you can open an account merely with a user name and email address, and you can withdraw your BTC without any fuss or further identification or verifications. You *can* attach your bank account to your exchange account, and that makes things faster once it's done, but you don't *need* to do this.
While I *constantly* see people bitching about problems with Coinbase and MtGox, complaints about CampBX are few and far between.

As I was reading your first paragraph, I was wondering what the SEC was going to say about this. My thought was, gee, they've found a way to sell unsecured, unregulated securities with no oversight. What could possibly go wrong?
Bitcoin, as a currency, has advantages over fiat, but to confuse the problems associated with fiat with the system to prevent investor fraud in the securities market, is worrisome.
I see the idea of an IPO "agreement" to trade BTC for future company value to be incredibly risky. Right up there with the idea that people should only invest what monies they could afford to loose completely  into BTC, people buying these IPO's are exposing themselves to major headaches.

If you have a bank account you can have them wire bitfloor some money, (arrange this with Bitfloor first, as they will give you "a to the penny amount" and an account number to send that identifies the wire as yours.
The wire cost you $15 at your bank, and Bitfloor's bank charges you a fee to receive it.
If you are only looking to buy a few coins, that $30 surcharge is steep, but it gets your money into your Bitfloor account in something like 36-48 hours.
If you are looking to just buy 3 coins or so, try localbitcoins.com, find someone in your area that trades, and do a face to face. They'll usually charge you 10-15% over market for the service, but if you're only looking for a small amount, might be the cheapest way.

Well, I don't use coinbase, but consider: there really isn't much competition for what they do. I would suspect that most permanent losses to people using coinbase are probably their own careless or unknowing mistakes.
If coinbase weren't on the up and up, and capable, there is no way they would have gotten the recent $25M funding.
Things can only get better for coinbase, and they probably will quickly.

This is *terrible* advice. USB sticks can and will fail just like *any* piece of hardware.
He really needs to 1) make a paper wallet, and 2) take his wallet.dat file, copy it (leaving the orignal where it is), rename it to something innocuous, then archive it with WinRAR, using password protection. Then place the archive in the cloud, like his Skydrive, or Gmail, or Dropbox, but somewhere outside of the house, should the USB get lost, stolen, or burned in a house fire or something crazy like that. Offsite backup is a MUST.

Having a large deposit doesn't result in visits from the G-men unless you don't declare the money and pay taxes on the profit.
I'm no accountant, but what I've picked up is that if you owned the BTC for a year or more, your profit is taxed at the lower (15%) long term capital gains rate. I also believe by what I've read that you don't have to pay *any* long term capital gain if your income is under $37k.
As far as short term capital gains taxes, I don't know what the rates are, but they are higher than the 15%
Eventually, the IRS will figure out how to monitor our BTC usage, and if you have been spending BTC profits without paying taxes annually, eventually you are going to have a "problem."
What you need to do is put aside (like in a bank) 15% of the money you take out of BTC and hold it for your tax liability. I know it sucks, but going to jail or loosing your house is just a touch more traumatic.

I just posted this to someone else's inquiry, but it might help you too.
"Assuming that you are in the US, and you know that you want these in a week or two, probably the least hassle and most secure thing is to create an account with CampBX, mail them a US Postal Money order, (they cost $1.60 each and can be had up to a $1000 maximum size) wait the several days that it takes for CampBX to receive your mail and post the money to your account. As long as you don't try to add more than $1000 per day, there are no ID hassles at all.
Once your money is in your account, you can make your buy at your leisure, and remove the BTC, again, at your leisure, to an address that your bitcoin wallet of choice will provide for that purpose.
You could leave a balance of dollars in your account, or spend every penny, as you like.
I have heard of no one getting scammed using CampBX, only complaints that their site can be slow, due to growing pains that they are working to correct."
 Moving BTC into your account is just as easy, and after you sell  your BTC, you can have CampBX cut you check that they will mail. There is a fee for this, but dealing with these people, it is possible that NO BANKS ARE INVOLVED. I like that. You will too.
Their fees are only 0.55% if I remember correctly.

The easiest and most likely way to fix this is to uninstall both bitcoin-qt and armory, then reinstall what you know to be the latest versions of each (64 bit armory) Don't worry about loosing either the blockchain download, or your wallet.dat file, they are held in completely different directories than the main programs. With the newer armory versions, you don't need to start bitcoin-qt first, like you used to. It just has to be there for armory to access on its own.
In fact, if you know that you have the latest versions of both, and you are purposely starting bitcoin-qt before you start armory, that could be the problem. *Don't* start bitcion-qt, just let Armory take care of it.

Lots of good advice, but no one has addressed the most important thing you have said.
Putting ALL YOUR SAVINGS into bitcoin right now would be incredibly foolish. (Unless you are still living with your parents, and these savings amount to $70)
Sure, the price is high, and going up, probably because of the Chinese entry into the market. But just like in April, this over-exuberant run up of the price will become a bubble, and a whole lot of Chinese are going to learn what happens when you invest into a bubble.
Put SOME of your savings in now, then catch your breath and watch. If things remain stable, consider putting more in later, or buy in right after the inevitable bubble bursts.

I don't understand all the hand wringing and the gnashing of teeth.
This is what Roman says on the exchanges home page:








Roman says his bank account is being forcibly closed. This is a Capital One decision, probably that Roman's account was more a pain in the ass than it was worth.
If you have coins there, log in and withdraw them. I've got mine back, and I see many others on different forums claiming the same.
Roman says that those of us with dollars in our account will have it returned. Capital One might close his account, but they can't just seize his funds. Fucking over his popular Bitcoin exchange will probably prove to be a PR problem for Capital One. Call them, tell them what assholes they are.
While my cash is in limbo, of course I'm nervous, but I expect to get it back, soon, and also soon, I expect that Roman will resurrect his exchange using another more enlightened banker.

You are absolutely right. While the Fed might claim that inflation is good because it raises profits and wages, the reality is that corporate America broke the connection between increased productivity and increasing wages back in the 1970's. Sure inflation will raise prices and profits, but just like in Argentina, American wages would not be allowed to increase. Wage earners would be fucked, and the inflation would just be another method to transfer the wealth of the middle class to the top 1%.

Create an account with CampBX. You need a user name, an email address, and no ID or bank account info.
Fund your account by purchasing money orders with cash at your post office, put your user name and email address on the bottom of the money order and mail to CampBX. (Be sure to save the stub.) They'll let you put in $1000 a day with no fuss, up to a total of $9000.
Takes several days for the mail to get to them and have them make the deposit, but then you are good to go. Buy what you want and remove the coins to your own wallet.

So taking his question at face value, the graph looks so poorly because as there is virtually no trading going on in MtGox GBP, there is no data to show.

Localbitcoins is probably a ripoff worldwide. They want to sell  you coins way over going exchange rates, and they want to buy from you at rates way below exchange rates.

Trade your BTC for precious metals, then sell those to coin and bullion dealers. Bet you come real close to escaping "fees" all the way around.
