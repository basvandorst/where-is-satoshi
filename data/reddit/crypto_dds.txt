Terrible. I'd wait out the massive bubble bursting in an RV and save my money if I had to. No way I'd buy a house that has no value. The US already saw their housing market crash and banks fail in 2008. Good luck to you!

Is Bitmain doing this by slowing down the hash rate, causing a panic sell, driving up fees, &amp; pushing everyone toward BCash? They are pushing BCash really hard. The news recently shows that some people know what is coming.

Bitcoin is a beautiful piece of computer code and will fluctuate wildly until mass adoption and regulation. Ride the wave and accumulate.

I’m here for the greed. People in 1st World Countries don’t need bitcoin. We are all in it for the profit. 3rd World needs the tech. Bitcoin will survive and advance. Still HODLing &amp; buying at 6k every time it hits the mark.

1 bitcoin. Then buy alt coins. If bitcoin runs again, you’ll never own one full coin. If we get institutional money, it’s going into Bitcoin first. The alts will always be there. Most wont survive. Bitcoin has stood the test of time for 9+ years.

Bam! Love it. You can’t kill this asset class. It’s the Terminator and it’s never going to die.

LOL! We’ve seen these articles for a year. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 19:49:06
You just answered your own question. It’s not decentralized. They own it and control it. It’s pegged to inflation, hyperinflation, etc.

It’s for banks. Not average consumers. He’s going after Ripple.

There will be no large correction, IMO. $100+ daily gains until late 2019. Conservative math estimates are stating $47k/coin Nov 2019.
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:34:08
Congrats OP! Get back in. It's going to 50k (conservative estimates) by Nov 2019.

@_date: 2018-11-03 04:27:12
Great points in the video.  Save. Be patient. Live below your means. Don’t buy new cars. Kids born today won’t even be driving. Stock market will have a big correction by 2025 or sooner with a long trend-line of negative returns for several years. Pounce on opportunity during a crash. Crypto will be apart of every millennial’s portfolio in the future.  Baby Boomers can’t bounce back from another recession. Millennials can and will.
@_date: 2018-11-29 05:06:28
Haha! You mean new investors or others who have lost their shirts. Most seasoned investors watch daily charts and know when it’s a bull run. Your mom or grandma will mention bitcoin bc it’s on the news again. We’re a long way off from a bull run until institutions jump in with ETF’s. Then it will be a wild ride. This uptick is nothing...for now.
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:34:58
The Japanese also bombed Pearl Harbor. Nothing new here. I guess Bitcoin is finally dead. Let’s pack it up and go home, people.  Show’s over.

It’s a Swiss Bank account in your pocket. You’re missing the boat.

Shitcoins come and go. Bitcoin specifically is being manipulated most. Don’t. Support any of it. Just stating the obvious that nothing is wrong with bitcoin at all.
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:38:06
I hope it shoots up to $100,000 soon. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 20:06:46
Not sure there is much value left in shorting at this price point. Currently $3800.00. 
@_date: 2019-01-11 08:26:19
No. Not until Bitcoin Cash, Litecoin, &amp; Doge Coin are at $0.00.

All I could think of during this video was bitcoin and how easy it solves these problems. When he was describing gold and buying/selling/sending across the country it sounded so ridiculous and antiquated.

Price is dropping bc Korea has pulled out and 300 Billion is sitting on the sidelines while the Korean government has bottle necked everyone and created a choke point of entry back into the market. 
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:09:02
We can only hope this happens. People are getting a second and last chance to buy at these levels and lower before Bitcoin becomes so expensive you won’t be able to afford a single coin. Accumulate and wait. Bitcoin never dies.

Futures and whales are ruining bitcoin. Nothing else.
@_date: 2018-11-15 06:04:53
I agree with you 100%. I’m buying at any range, any time. I believe in bitcoin. A Swiss bank account in my pocket is priceless to me. One day it will be odd to know bitcoin was worth 5k when it’s sitting at 20k, 50k, 100k, 200k, 500k, 1 million. If you believe, take some risks. It’s not a stock and produces nothing. It’s a very valuable asset to me and others. We are early to the party. Until institutions jump in, you’ll see fluctuations and market manipulation run rampant. The average Joe can’t afford to lose 50%. Average Joe is spooked right now and the coin easily moves up and down in price. Bitmex leverage, futures, Coinbase news, etc. Gold has a 7 trillion dollar market. Crypto gets 1/7th of that, you are going to make some great money. Time takes time. Amazon, HP, IBM, Bank of America, Chase, etc aren’t securing block chain patents bc the tech is worthless. It’s going to be a massive influx of money into this asset class one day and you better be positioned accordingly if you want to ride the ride. It moves swiftly when it decides to run, almost out of reach for most people to even own 1 full bitcoin. 35 million millionaires in the world. Less than 21 million bitcoins. Do the math.

It’s $395 for the implant. They’ll charge you extra for the abutment, crown, bone graft, membrane, and extraction if needed. It’s never what it seems. Plus those billboards are 4-10k per month to advertise.

There’s no float. It’s gonna swing wildly on these small exchanges. Also, no improvements? What do you mean? It works perfectly as intended. Just slowly waiting for mass adoption.

Can someone smarter than me explain this? Why do we need a payment processor service at all? It takes a 1% fee for transactions as well. Bitcoin is a bank in your pocket. Snap QR code of sender/receiver. Send to wallet. Done. What’s the relevance here?

I hate these idiots who send shit like this to me. It’s like they honestly believe they made a great decision to sit out and not buy one of the greatest asset classes ever made. I really hope each and everyone of them FOMO
buy in at 100k and get 0.000001 satoshi’s worth. No one got rich by not taking big risks. Hater’s gonna hate.
