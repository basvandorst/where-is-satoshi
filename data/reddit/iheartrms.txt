I know. I'm a security engineer for a big company with govt contracts. It's a Big Deal. These bitcoin exchanges aren't doing due diligence.

You aren't wrong. Up voted.

They simply don't understand how things work or the risks involved. Ignorance is bliss. I doubt this will change anything. Are people bailing on the other exchanges? Not as far as I can see.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:58:52
I don't know why anyone trusts any of these exchanges to hold their wallets. Especially since none of them appear to have dedicated security teams or third party auditing which would seem to be essential for the dollar values we are talking about here.

$65M invested with an outfit that won't even publish a phone number. Unbelievable. I've got far less than that invested with my local bank and I require that they actually have a physical presence in my neighborhood.

You think porn stars are going to be able to secure their bitcoin wallets?

If the private key is lost then the coins really are gone.  Someone does not have to have received them.  Not saying that's what happened here. Just pointing out a quirk of crypto currency.

Everyone knows windows can be broken. Few people understand the intricacies of bitcoin. As bitcoin becomes more popular an ever smaller percentage will understand these things. Nor should they have to.

People are to be respected. Ideas do not. Religion is an idea.
@_date: 2016-03-28 00:47:34
People change religions all the time like they change ideas or other opinions. They don't change their skin color or native language etc. Thus ideas are perfectly legitimate targets for mockery and derision including religion.

I work with and am good friends with (as in I've eaten meals with their families at their house) a lot of the people who would be affected by this.
These folks aren't going to use Bitcoin. They don't understand it and won't trust it.

I love electronics kits and have built several. Wouldn't mind picking up one more but all of your stuff seems to be lacking explanation of what the kit actually does. You need a lot more detail.
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:49:28






Yeah. And heritage not hate and honest elections and not oppressing minorities and we just want immigration law enforced and don't really hate brown people and... Any other lies you want to tell us? 


Why encourage everyone to HODL if it isn't about making money? If it isn't about making money let those who want to sell, sell. 


Uh... Yes we are. Every one of those HODL posts over the last three years? Making money. It isn't just coincidence that selling decreases the price and you are telling people to hold.

Unlike land bitcoin can be practically subdivided into very small units. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 23:04:04
That's not good for something which hopes to be a respectable currency. We need stability.

It's as simple as having a dedicated computer. Computers are dirt cheap now. You could access your online banking with a raspberry pi even.

Bitcoin has officially jumped the shark.
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:04:00
Isn't someone transferring money around between wallets a potential DOS attack on the blockchain? Can't anyone cause the blockchain to grow arbitrarily large in a very short amount of time?
@_date: 2013-05-14 05:44:10
Really...I'm not sure noscript is sufficient. Especially if you are using Windows. For dealing with large amounts of money online you really need a dedicated machine JUST for those accounts. Lots of businesses have had their bank accounts similarly plundered. The solution is always a dedicated machine.
@_date: 2013-06-23 02:14:46
Bitcoin needs fewer investors and more actual users buying and selling goods with it. You buy and hold speculators can all piss off.
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:41:06
What do you mean by recovered?
@_date: 2013-10-11 18:11:28
By PC you mean Windows. And there we've hit upon the real issue. Linux (and traditional phone operating systems in general) lets you lock things down. There are all sorts of mechanisms to manage permissions, capabilities, etc. Windows pretty much requires the end user to have administrator. You *could* lock Windows down but it becomes so unusable that nobody tolerates it. You could totally make an Android phone where you could change things by default, just like Windows on the desktop. There's no technical reason why it is not possible. Android could ship with everything running as root and not require elevated permissions for anything and not have a "play store" with moderates apps configured by default etc. But it doesn't. Because we're tired of security disasters.

It IS a big deal when your money is wired to a foreign country. It's gone. Fraud reports won't pay the bills. And when it is a business/commercial account? Employees don't get their paychecks because the money isn't there. It is happening far too often.

Operational Security: Keep your mouth shut.
I don't tell anyone who doesn't have an absolute need to know where I keep my money, guns, gold, or bitcoin. Family or not.

This the part I don't understand. What do we do when the blockchain hits a terabyte?  A petabyte?
@_date: 2013-10-12 03:18:41


True, the expectations are different. But that is changing, fortunately.


Yep. 


Only because the expectation has been set. It can be changed also, and is being changed as people move to phones and tablets and other more locked down systems.


Small. But Linux's market share on locked down hardware is HUGE. And that's what matters these days. The PC is dying.










They generally aren't capable of following the instructions to root their devices. Too complicated.


You don't market it that way but that is exactly what "no user serviceable parts inside" means. 














Not at all. Removing root acces protects a whole lot more than loss of their files. Removing root access prevents:
1. keyboard sniffing leading to the compromise of all of their rest of their accounts including banking information, Google, iTunes, etc.
2. the machine being used as a DDOS source using spoofed packets and other things which require raw sockets.
3. the attacker from effectively hiding his tracks by installing kernel rootkits.
4. the attacker from also hiding his tracks by modifying log files.
5. the attacker from installing their own software such as websites for phishing or hosting illicit content etc.
6. the attacker from twiddling with the raw disk itself to hide his tracks or cause other damage or steal information
7. the attacker from reading out keys and passwords from RAM which could have all kinds of negative impact.
8. the attacker from sabotaging the OS files rendering the machine unbootable which also effectively causes your userland data to go away
9. the attacker from turning on the camera or microphone without you knowing about it which could be quite embarrassing indeed
10. the attacker from being able to read your hashed and likely crackable password out of the shadow file
I could go on...there are LOTS of reasons not to run as root.


It seems to work pretty well on Android and iPhone devices (all of which have root users).
@_date: 2013-10-11 23:22:50
It isn't that they will. It is that they DO. ie. Android. Windows should have done the same years ago for the desktop and set the right expectation.
@_date: 2013-05-11 03:07:11

YOU earned it. Not them. Are they Republicans? :)
@_date: 2013-10-11 20:02:23
Not necessarily. You do not have to receive a root password when you get a new Linux computer. Ubuntu has no root password. You install Ubuntu or buy a preinstalled Ubuntu machine and root is locked. And this again goes back to my main point: Linux has so many more options for secure configurations. 
@_date: 2013-06-23 06:52:39
I know very well what the difference is and my statement stands. Speculators can piss off. How much analysis do you really think these "investors" are really doing? There's barely any data available in the first place other than Mt Gox prices.
@_date: 2013-05-11 04:28:25
Nonono....that's "Grey".
@_date: 2013-10-11 00:35:11
No doubt. Moderation of what software is allowed to be installed is a critical security feature of any system. Fortunately, Google has some pretty good data on Android malware which show it to be impressively secure:
@_date: 2013-10-11 21:43:25
Again, you COULD be. Just uninstall sudo. That's basically what they've done with Android.
@_date: 2013-10-10 20:13:33
Linux is in every Android phone. There are millions upon millions out there. The difference is Android is locked down to sensible activities. Windows lets you shoot yourself in the foot all day long.
@_date: 2013-10-12 08:20:11
And you are missing the point. There is no such thing as perfect security. But some security models are far better than others. Keep putting up walls. Let them move on to a softer target.
@_date: 2013-04-17 21:26:50
They should be looking for bitcoin SPENDERS. That they aren't or they can't find any is a problem.
