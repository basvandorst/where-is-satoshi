I just wanted to say thanks for doing your part to help permanently cement all the mockery of Bitcoin's legitimacy with that fine from Finsec, the deliberate solicitation of "stress testing" (a.k.a. DDoS'ing) the blockchain which mysteriously vanished so *suddenly*, and all your anti-state ranting you used to do but for some reason don't anymore.

Spam does not represent legitimate economic transactions and externalizes its costs to people who are not interested in storing spam forever and who would, if they had a choice, block all spam from being stored on their nodes.

"The miners" isn't an aggregating group. The miners in question would have to *actively orphan* other miners' blocks; in essence, this is building a precedent for, and paving the way for, a miner-vs-miner struggle against deliberate orphaning.
Most miners don't even have the infrastructure to be able to do things like this, nor do they have the ability to retool their infrastructure on the fly. They can't even upgrade/handle literally a tiny change in the nature of mined blocks thanks to BIP improvements..!
Deliberately orphaning miners who don't want to or can't participate in this kind of historical re-spend is going to make those people super angry as the majority hashrate then *also takes their block rewards too.*

You called me a criminal, and when I asked you what you were talking about, you went silent.
You also said I was "whining" when I described a number of actually criminal acts. You also said that, of the group of people about whom I was complaining (who committed actual criminal acts,) I was the only criminal of the group.
You are a scumbag, dude. You just let that sit there, and now you're coming over to r\Bitcoin to attack people—again without any basis in fact.
This is a pattern for you.

Your attempt to snow is ineffective. You appear to have mistaken me for someone who can't code.
First off, in your first link, there is literally zero conversation about 1MB being a temporary limit specifically to address spam. In fact, the dust limit he's talking about is the "minimum payment amount," which he in fact references literally in the prior sentence. And in fact the source code as of that time literally agrees with this. Check out git commit 0a61b0df1224a5470bcddab302bc199ca5a9e356:
        // To limit dust spam, require a 0.01 fee if any output is less than 0.01
        if (nMinFee &lt; CENT)
            foreach(const CTxOut&amp; txout, vout)
                if (txout.nValue &lt; CENT)
                    nMinFee = CENT;
In fact, in the link you specifically linked to, the conclusion states:
"There is no discussion around how the max block size change was decided or how the 1MB value was derived."
Your *own link* states there was no such discussion, which means there is no evidence.


No, in fact, he was telling someone in that thread *not* to implement a block size change. He was saying it purely as a conditional: "We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it."
Therefore, it wasn't a plan to remove it. It wasn't a definite. At all.


That logic is fallacious. If you think that the lack of mention in the whitepaper means it was planned to be removed, then you must also presume that the ~21m maximum bitcoin limit was planned to also be removed.
It is also false because saying "the absence of a plan is a plan," is ridiculous. That's some Rumsfeld logic right there.


False. Literally your own evidence directly contradicts you.
@_date: 2016-08-29 23:18:20
He is being treated unkindly because he has no problem calling someone a "whiner" when they complain about specific criminal actions including harassment or threats.

This is a "key dialog center [in] the industry"? Reddit is a key industry dialog centre? Whaa?
And r\btc filters and selectively deletes comments and moderates things too. It's just subreddit policy. There are *actual* places where censorship is virtually nonexistent, and participatory developers tend not to like spending time there, so they typically wither and fester into angry dox'ing content-free zones where people congratulate each other on getting banned from Reddit..?
And a self-referential post which self-references further other posts is.. classic misdirection. And mostly meaningless in the sense that the only difference between r\btc and r\bitcoin is the specific types of references they decide to delete.

It isn't: Ver viciously attacks people and in the absence of lower-level technical acumen he believes he knows what, technically, Bitcoin should do moving forward. He also uses fairly underhanded methods of achieving what he feels are priority end-goals for bitcoin, and is unable to evaluate when people are lying to him. He uses bitcoin.com to promote ethereum and (at least last I checked) also promoted dangerous privacy-destroying wallets for users in return for advertising money.
He prioritizes bitcoin price over bitcoin integrity and decentralization (and has IMO stated about as much.)
He used personal access to blockchain.info to divulge and dox a user's private details over a $50 debt (after the site said it was impossible to do that.)
He contributed to the Bitcoin Foundation, which you could say paid for some small amount of bitcoin development but in the end IMO he was one of the people responsible for tolerating and condoning the total mismanagement and misappropriation of the BCF user funds which are now all gone with almost nothing to show for it.
His heart may be in the right place, but his completely disproportional reach and means is directly resulting in really, really shitty conditions for people who don't necessarily have such reach and means, and this is an unfortunate blight which is not unique just to rich people *in bitcoin.*
(edit: grammar)

Additionally, prior to the company's founding, multiple other corporations with large or significant funding sources (blockchain.info and MtGox) were *explicitly* pushing the devs around and blaming them *directly* for losses that amounted to the hundreds of millions of dollars.
Open Source developers—virtually no funding, virtually no support, virtually all the risk.
The external corporations were sharpening their knives—just waiting for an opportunity to co-opt development.
Now that that's much more difficult, I find it quite ironic that so many altcoin pumpers are now magically manufacturing objections to Blockstream's existence, while completely ignoring actual mysteries such as who's paying Tom Zander, who specifically was funding the Sybil attacks on Bitcoin, who precisely is in charge of the -classic project, why a technically unsophisticated racist is deciding security posture, and and who was funding drug-abusing and -advocating developers to begin with.
Is it *officially* known who donated all that money to Bitcoin Unlimited? Nobody in r\btc seems to care.
@_date: 2016-08-30 23:56:38

They would have to have done multiple replacements; additionally, publishing it there means all the spiders, caches, user downloads, and other user commentary and so on would potentially also need to be replaced. A small webpage is easy to archive. You can go to archive.is and other locations and have them archive that page. A binary is not so easy to rapidly trigger mirrors of.
It's useful in that sense. "Do you see this?" "Yeah, I see that." "What's the site TLS fingerprint?" "6F A1 AE 29 E1 4C 75 CF 2E F7 3C 86 AD 03 FA 0B AD 99 F1 DB" "Okay then, well thanks."
Probably the easiest way to avoid stuff like this is to build it yourself, if you're able, and then compare the results against the gitian.sigs repository: and ideally before *that* you've downloaded or otherwise acquired and done your best to verify the developer GnuPG keys who commit to the gitian.sigs repository.

It is their decision, and making the tools available to them to help decide whether they want to include spam in blocks is the developers' decision. In fact, making it a default is also the developers' decision.

He did **NOT** say it *should* be made in some future date. The language was:
"We can phase in a change later if we get closer to needing it."
That is the exact quote. He never said it *should* be done. You are deliberately misinterpreting the words. In fact, his response was to tell people **not** to run jgarzik's blocksize modification.


The predetermined number itself is not mentioned. It's not 21 million at all. Neither does the paper mention anything about a 10-minute block target. The paper didn't explicitly mention the precision nor divisibility, either.
You are *lying* when you said there was a *plan* to "temporarily" deal with spam, and the quotes you used actually demonstrate the exact opposite.
The protocol message size limit is also not mentioned; nor the location of the decimal place; nor the stack-based scripting language.
By your logic, the lack of mention of such things proves that there was a plan to *remove them*.
In other words, the contents of the whitepaper *do not at all* prove your case and you must therefore rely on *other evidence* to do so.
The platitude about "middle grounds" is complete nonsense. If there's a "middle ground" then to get what ground you actually want, all you have to do is make a demand 2x out from where you want the final result to be. Then the middle ground is exactly what you want.

Many of the posts were with his voice and knowledge. It was probably an active passthrough for grammar and diction correction; augmented humans, with other humans. I have known people who outsourced their work to Ukrainian programmers, and passed it off as their own for a tiny fraction of their full salaries. In this case, the grammar and diction was made fairly uncompromisingly native (almost always) and then she made a lot of her own posts on top of that. She is an actual person. She makes appearances at MP's occasional small-attendance gathering type affairs.
.. but like.. literally often the only thing different was syntax and diction.

This is false; "price" is not what attracts developer interest. This sort of fundamental failing to comprehend what motivates competent developers is precisely why bcash supporters typically hand-wave so much about whether or not any of the competent devs will ever work under the primary developer of bcash—who is an unapologetic copyright thief—or not.
Reality has already presented itself. Competent developers have almost uniformly refused to do so.
@_date: 2018-01-04 05:21:21
NO. WRONG.
Conformal's implementation (whatever they're calling themselves now) were originally taking credit for work that the bitcoin developers had done; they develop in secret; and when they released one of their first mined-blocks on testnet, there was a 500+ block reorg which **crashed** normal bitcoin core because it was so long. (So if it was an original bitcoin core client doing it, why didn't the attacker's node crash?)
Additionally, they don't report segfaulting crashes which were due to memory pressures in a host OS environment—these crashes do not exist in bitcoin core.
**Therefore** Conformal's btcd **IS NOT** consensus-compatible.
On top of that, you can't assert that two implementations—no matter how slavishly the Conformal team copies the plain bitcoin reference code—are consensus compatible when they're written in two completely different languages.

Yes, for bcash they **are that bad.**
One of the first things they did was commit **hundreds of thousands** of formatting changes, in part I suspect to obfuscate the work they're doing, but in part likely because they have no idea what this does to their ability to merge in useful work from Bitcoin—and this is going to directly get in the way of any future merges with a rapidly, and disproportionately increasing difficulty of doing so the longer the divergence continues.
This is software engineering reality—a reality which I suppose it's not too surprising that their primary developer (an unapologetic copyright thief) does not appear capable of grasping.

They should have told people in advance when they were going to enable bcash; and then stuck to that timeline.

The fact that a user can import insecure private keys to begin with, presuming that their software already scans for these kinds of problems, is contradictory.
They're not telling you about the litany of security problems their wallet and software has caused over the years; and their attempt to minimize this particular problematic issue is dwarfed by extensive past wallet address generation failures.
The bottom line is what we have been f'ing saying since 2011—don't use webwallets. Aside from the early thievery from MyBitcoin, the exit scams from innumerable other wallets, blockchain's own systems have been extremely vulnerable **in the past** due in part to short-sighted and problematic development practices, and we have discovered thanks to prior dox'ing activities of Roger Ver due to a user refusing to return $50 worth (at the time) of Bitcoin, that promises of user privacy and security are worth exactly the electrons it took to light our screens up to convey it.

Your timeline is incorrect.
Note that six months prior to the halving event, price was $5.50 USD. The price them rose and then, at the time of the halving, it was approximately double (or slightly more) than that.
In the following April (2013) the spike coincided with an enormous dump of ASIC hashrate on the market. Note that in Mar 2013, the single greatest hashrate increase in bitcoin's history at that time happened: 38.13%. Avalon was arguably first to market in January; BFL began delivery in February, BTCGarden in May, BitFury released in June, etc.
I am saying that since it became obvious and specific and especially *calculable* how strong the hashrate was, confidence in the security of the network rose, and price was free to rise as well.
So yes, it began to be priced six months in advance. And the spikes you are talking about had *absolutely nothing to do with the subsequent spikes.*

I will also note that there is almost no evidence whatsoever that SR was more than a small fraction of total bitcoin demand; it is calculable, in fact, based on court documents and evidence that totals at their peak were a small fraction of total bitcoin network transaction volume *even if we presume 50% of all transaction volume was just change vouts,* and we *ignore all activity on exchanges completely.* So, when comparing bitcoin totals, and pretending that all *internal, offchain SR revenue is represented by some equivalent bitcoin blockchain transactions* the amount is small.
In fact, it is proportionally smaller than virtually all measurements of black market proportions in the real world—which makes sense when you consider the transparency and limited reach of bitcoin.

What would you call the wholesale robbing via bitcoin and fiat) withdrawal from MtGox except a false demand which then imploded with MtGox fell, and everyone lost their money.

Since it was compromised and people were actively stealing money from them, the price rise attributable to MtGox was therefore, beyond just naked opinion, a lie.

Meeting minutes should also be open. All meeting minutes. Going back to the beginning. All finances: where my bitcoins were spent: should be out in the open. All of it. In the open.
How much the old PR person was paid, out of my money, to nod her head vigourously on a world-televised broadcast about things that were strongly hostile to bitcoin's existence; how much if any the board paid to salaries; where did the money go, if any, during the run-up to $1200.
Did any of the top-tier corporate members actually donate any bitcoins and pay up? Or were they paid up by advertising or other deals?
Correcting current problems is fine, go for it: accountability for *past problems* is the only thing that will satisfy all those people who optimistically donated before and now feel burned by small leaks which hint at greater problems, and are now being misrepresented by directors who claim to represent *your members' voice* -- when part of *your members' voice* was to elect the guy who ground some gears in the first place.

That is, what if things like Bitcoin or, say, the easy accessibility of gold coins (if they were easily accessible) provided an excuse by which the government and those in power could (without admitting it) tighten the screws on the plebs who don't necessarily have the means to participate in alternative currency type vehicles?

This is not necessarily correct: and at least, seems to be disproved by the simple counter-example that as Bitcoin has become more popular, node count is *declining steeply*.
If you watch conversation of users who are in channels on Freenode where the Bitcoin Core devs hang out, you can see that one of the biggest complaints about running Bitcoin Core is that it takes so long for it to sync with the network—and that it consumes so much disk space.
So, if the variable were in fact straight popularity, then we should have seen a rapid *increase* in node count. If the variable were popularity vs. block size, we would have seen an *increase* in node count.
Since we didn't see an *increase* in node count, neither of the above can be true.

Consensus is unanimous. If the whole community isn't going to fork, then the result will be a fork, and value will plummet as users try to guess which one will be most likely to succeed.
Blocksize increases are not the only way to scale, and currently blocks are not full. If they were, and transactions were failing, and the fee market was failing, then I suspect there wouldn't be much objection to a blocksize increase.

Here in BitcoinLand, control of the private keys comprises the lion's share of rightful ownership, in my opinion. I do not mean to imply that the one who controls the keys is consequently the rightful owner: rather, I mean to imply that Bitcoin allows ownership to a degree that is not really possible in the real world where good can be easily.. appropriated.. with little to no recourse for anyone who does not have the reasonable means to object.
He may have the legal right to those coins, but until he controls and possesses the private keys which can be used to authorize the further movement of those coins, realistically *of the ownership of Bitcoins which is possible,* he doesn't have more than a mostly-symbolic fraction.
I am not particularly concerned about government theft/civil forfeiture/whatever. I am more referring to the likelihood of nefarious intent leading to theft.

You can stop making sideways generalized comments as though you think you know what I and others do or don't believe when we've made no such statements at all and do not intend to.
There are greater risks in allowing someone else to store your coins than there are in storing your own. The worse security posture is allowing someone else to invisibly, unverifiably, determine how your coins are secured.
Beyond security, it is a simple question of essentially perfectly non-violent, non-coercive, sovereign choice as to the disposition of your own property.
Either you have this, or you don't; and, since this level of control over valuable property has never really existed before.. *ever*.. if you relinquish this, you are no longer participating meaningfully in the *ownership* of your own coins.

From another tor-enabled machine elsewhere, you can test it with something like:

Trying 127.42.42.0...
Connected to 127.42.42.0.
Escape character is '^]'.
Connection closed by foreign host.
You can see whether it fails with this result:
torify telnet blahblah.onion 8333
Trying 127.42.42.0...
[Jun 16 03:43:19] ERROR torsocks[8634]: General SOCKS server failure (in socks5_recv_connect_reply() at socks5.c:516)

And when you run bitcoin, don't forget the -externalip= part.
If you need assistance, there are people in  who can help you. If you get nothing but trolls responding to you, just highlight the ops.
Your router is probably irrelevant in this case.
Tor relays will not be sending encrypted messages to your IP:8333. Only the tor daemon where your hidden service is configured on should be making connections to your bitcoind on port 8333.
You should shut down external access to port 8333 if you want to run a Tor-only node.
If you are not concerned about being identified as a tor-to-IPv4 enabled gateway, consider running a dual-homed bitcoind so that the Tor-only users have another possible exit point their transactions can traverse.

This is old advice, and today is likely incorrect.
Do not give people a reason to shut off full nodes. There are too few of them running in countries.
Besides, people running Tor HS-reachable nodes are also contributing. Additionally, the current lack of full running nodes as described by this little graph here:
Means the total number of reachable, full nodes is shrinking so rapidly that it is conceivable that it will be possible to start doing network partition attacks on full nodes in the foreseeable future, and make SPV nodes much more likely to connect to a sybil rather than a real full node.
Running a full archival node at all, regardless of bandwidth, is still useful for the community as a whole.

Don't use Coinkite. If they go under or decide to lock up your funds, you have to assume they could be gone forever. That is, you are handing control over your coins to CoinKite.
You should not do this for one simple reason: there is no need to. You can achieve much better security by using other wallet systems.
Does Coinkite encrypt your and everyone's keys identically? Then whoever can read your email can unlock your keys and everyone else's in the event they send them out, and spend your money out of your account potentially before you can.
Really terrible wallet design. :(
You are completely correct to move away from blockchain.info. Wise decision.
Finally, a watch-only notification is good to see when people send money to one of your watched addresses: but if you are interested in helping prevent the theft of your money in the event someone $evil gets ahold of your privkeys, consider asking a miner to double-spend a transaction you keep in-the-ready in case money is spent under authority of your privkeys.
If it is a high-fee transaction, the double-spend could take priority and the miners will preferentially mine it: then, the special backup location receives the funds and the thief is hopefully semi-automatically thwarted.
It's really, really unfortunate that so many of these services keep complete control of your coins, when there's really no need for them to, at all. I mean how can you even tell if they're generating keys correctly?
@_date: 2015-12-26 23:39:37
It's not a "war". 0-conf has never been considered safe; it has been strongly recommended *against*. It is foolish to rely on them; people have lost significant amounts of bitcoin as a result of them.
Additionally, there is no additional risk of pretty much any of the realistically-likely RBF schemes. So..  no war.
And your comment doesn't negate the likelihood of a successfully-implementated hardfork *destroying* anyone's coins. And that is preciselu why I would say that anything that does destroy coins, will, or has, already (have) destroyed bitcoin.

Ask the bitcoin-core developers for projects they think would be most effective at returning bitcoin to proper decentralized status.
There are currently, right now, major endemic risks to bitcoin that have to do with wallet software, and especially mining hardware.
For example, KnC was funded almost entirely with their customers' money, broken promises about how much they would self-mine, and what are most likely lies when they knew for a fact that it would have been impossible for their customers to make back more bitcoin than their customers could have just purchased directly during their first series of pre-orders: with the impending likely full self-mining effort of their latest chip in 16 nm process, how much more centralized are mining operations going to get? How much more power in centralized mining are bitcoin users willing to tolerate?
With $10m, smart-property ASIC mining chips could be designed and built, and a PoW fork (a.k.a. ASIC Doomsday) could happen and hardware from dishonest and unreliable vendors like KnC could be selectively removed from the hashing ecosystem and returned to decentralized bitcoin users where it belongs.
@_date: 2018-08-27 02:26:56

@_date: 2014-06-14 01:11:42
Your arithmetic is incorrect. The expectation of reward is identical per-hash done regardless of the size of the pool as long as you ignore external factors such as latency tricks of the sort P2Pool engages in or DDoS attacks on a pool which manage to reduce its relative mining efficacy.
You can't say that a mining pool *should* solve every Xth block on average, therefore it **will** and the remainder from the Xth or X+nth block onwards somehow magically skips an expected reward during that final period before the retarget. Why? Because every single hash done towards solving a block has a fixed and identical chance of solving the block. This is true so long as we presume dSHA2 is the equivalent of a randomizing function when feeding it with nonces (which I guess we all do unless mrb_'s old rumour was right and there's a speedup only some people know about that gives 2x the result with the same computational power.)
Before someone tries to insist on another possibility, you also can't say that an integral over time due to hashrate variance calculates a difference in expected return because mining rewards per-retargeting-period *are not described by a continuous function*.
So, your *expectation* of a certain return for your hashrate is identical even if you solo-mine, even if exponential hashrate growth happens forever (which it won't because sustaining current growth rates will eventually eat the entire planet, but say for the sake of argument they do.)
The only real difference is that, as humans, we don't feel we can afford to gamble on longer periods of time because we might get hit by a bus tomorrow. Thus, because humans are humans and are mortal, less money now is worth more than more money later, to us. This isn't even a function of programmed inflationary currencies like USD or CAD.
Put another way, once your personal mining hashrate gives an expectation of reward with a *expected* period longer than you are willing to gamble for, splitting your reward over a shorter period of time with a pool with a higher hashrate is better-able to satisfy your human needs and wants. This splitting, again all else being equal, will reward you with an expectation of a return which is identical between most forms of mining.
With this in mind, if the difference to someone as a human is that one doesn't want to gamble with an entire day or an entire couple of days as with P2Pool's current expected solve period, versus a few hours or minutes, I don't have much to say aside from, "Patience is a virtue. Mining is not for you."

If Bitcoin is property and/or an asset, then the process of solo mining it is a self-award that the network allows; the network is *NOT* the origin of the action of the award.
Solo mining is the *creation* of new bitcoin, much like constructing furniture, building a ladder, digging for gold, or making crafts, or blowing glass. The result is a virtual item which the rest of the world agrees is valuable.
Therefore, paying taxes on it immediately is incorrect and inconsistent with other property ownership.
Unfortunately, they are likely correct for all other types of mining, with the possible exception of P2Pool mining.
These are the types of mining I'm considering; I'll focus on four:
• Solo. Solo mining follows precisely the above formula. You create a block. You announce the block. The network accepts it. You are forging (as in a blacksmith) bitcoins for yourself. The transactions are paid you as fees from other people, and are likely to fall under the income portion of the IRS' bulletin.
• Centralized Pool-mining. Pool subsequently mass-pays via non-coinbase transaction. You are often doing work units that the pool is then *paying* you for. This could be argued is payment for work done. This is likely what the IRS thinks it is referring to. Fees are the same, but paid to the pool, which then pays you separately.
• Centralized Pool-mining, but pool pays directly from coinbase. (Eligius.) You are doing work units. Each time someone in the pool finds a block, you are automatically paid via the coinbase transaction in that block. The initiator of the action, the forger of the payment, is the one who found the block. You are the recipient of payouts from other peoples' work except when you are the one to have found the block. Fees are an award which is automatically dispersed. Eligius is likely an exception to the above rule, as all it does is organize miners into cooperative cross-payment.
• P2Pool. Decentralized pool mining. You are being rewarded for proving that you would reward someone else. This is one step away from centralized pools. However, each payout in P2Pool is almost always an award from other people, until you are the originator of a block, in which case you are the one paying them. Fees are an award which are paid to the miners.
IMO, solo-mining is NOT subject to the IRS bulletin re: mining activities, but there are so few solo miners left that this point is probably irrelevant.
Meanwhile, IMO, the main centralized pools that don't pay from coinbase are subject to IRS rules about employing people as contractors or temporary workers. IMO, Eligius itself is exempt since it (normally) pays nobody and nobody (normally) pays it, and operates at a significant loss.
P2Pool is nearly identical to Eligius, minus the occasional manual payouts of Eligius.
IMO, the major pools are racking up *ENORMOUS* IRS debts which I'm confident the IRS is eventually going to realise, and come collecting.
Good luck, centralized pools, filtering out Americans and dealing with enormous back-taxes bills that prevent you from ever visiting the U.S. again!
IMO, it might be argued that P2Pool could be interpreted via the insulation of the sharechain. The *worth* of the sharechain solutions is thus the subtraction of the promises to pay the others in the sharechain from your assertion you will also pay yourself. The value of the sharechain itself is thus the saving grace for the P2Pool'ers in arguing they are as exempt as the solo'ers.

kanzure stopped talking on IRC too, that doesn't mean he just sat back and conceded. The main points are, in short, that it appears as though while the paper's author did cite some things, he didn't cite the origin of the primary crucial insight on which his paper rests; he's busily slurring kanzure's character out-of-band; he doesn't appear to have explored the primary criticism which appears to invalidate the results of the paper; and while I can imagine various scenarios where he's doing it perfectly innocently, based on past actions and antagonism, it seems the more likely scenario is it was deliberate.
He as a *Managing Editor* of a journal which aims to be the go-to spot for crypto-currency research publishing, should be held to a much higher academic standard. This standard has not been met, in my opinion; and nor does he give the appearance at all that he is correcting the mistakes that kanzure pointed out. But perhaps I'm wrong.
(To reiterate: so, even though he may not be claiming to publish a new idea, the fact that the primary insight does not appear to have been credited accurately is unusual given how recent the direct conversations about it were..?)

Not so bizarre, because the nature of the mining is a direct means by which people receive the digital good. Why would you lump together such disparate mechanisms into one? Either you dig the gold out of the ground yourself; or, someone is paying you in bags of gold dust. In one, you don't pay taxes in the real world until you *sell* or transact the gold. In the other, you do. Simple.

That's a great explanation; an alternative explanation was that the blocks were perfectly acceptable to bitcoin core, but not to btcd: perhaps by someone who thought he was running a stock btcd but it turns out may not have been?
Your logic is flawed and presumes that Confirmal's btcd itself was not the source of the problem.
Satoshi was adamant about a lot of things, as are the bitcoin core devs: one of them was that a *mining* node different from bitcoin core was a bad idea and could result in forks of this nature.
The existence of some, but not other, blocks that were not reorg'd out is not evidence of the efficacy of btcd mining.
Edit: In other words, one can't assert that the reorg had nothing to do with Conformal's btcd, only that you have no harder evidence than "a block built by Conformal's btcd was the start of an enormous reorg'ing fork that broke testnet for.. something like a week."

@_date: 2014-06-14 19:03:04
I have been mining since November 2010. I have spent more time than you thinking about this. Your arithmetic is incorrect. I have stated why it is incorrect. Mining in a larger pool has absolutely nothing to do with different earnings. Mining in a pool which itself is growing has nothing to do with different earnings unless their payout scheme is exploitable. The mathematics has already been done by people who were not only smarter than you are, but much better-able to explain themselves.
If your way was correct, then the non-exploitable pools would be exploitable and you could make lots of money exploiting them just moving hashrate around at just the right time. Except pool-hopping is a well-known problem with well-known parameters.
I have provided you with two counter-examples now which IMO clearly disprove your seeming-arithmetic assertions. Either explain how pool-hopping is still impossible by varying a pool's hashrate, or explain how mining reward is in fact magically a continuous function.

Investment banks don't like people acting in ways that make them look bad. Image is everything when your customers are rich elites. The antagonism going on with the Conformal team is not maximizing the dollar value they are being paid to do work. A cooperative effort where teams share ideas and cross-pollinate with less ego gets more done.
Since Conformal doesn't act this way, either they have a like-minded funder who enjoys watching strife, or their funder doesn't know how badly they're behaving.
An investment bank funding antagonistic independent third-party implementations of let's face it, monetarily fragile cryptocurrency doesn't fit.
I assert it's more probably someone else who doesn't mind burning a few short-term dollars to satisfy an ego, gambling on a larger long-term payout in the event Bitcoin Core devs vanish one day.

Selling or buying that tiny amount of bitcoins isn't market-moving. Nobody cares. Peter Todd has been a strong naysayer about many of the technical details of Bitcoin for years. Why would the fact that someone who is highly critical about a system and only held a small amount of Bitcoins (which proves he had no confidence in it to begin with) be a market-leader?
It makes less sense than 30,000 bitcoins being dumped on a market for whatever the bidders can get away with, or just the plain fact that ghash.io likely has &gt;50% of the total network hashrate in hardware they themselves own or at least control.

No, it isn't, since a block's timestamp is loosely tied to the network time consensus, which isn't actually tied to the real time basically at all.
Each block can either be two hours into the future from the network time consensus, or up to something like 12 hours in the past in the extreme case. This means that bitcoin block timestamps aren't even chronologically ordered.

ASIC Doomsday is the secret algorithm that all ASIC manufacturers *should* be putting into their ASIC chips which can be trivially enabled but does something slightly different from dSHA2. For example, sha2(n+sha2(x)). The idea is that in the event that an ASIC manufacturer misbehaved, the other ones could submit their algos to the Bitcoin Core devs, and a hard fork could save us all from the misbehaving jerks while still enabling all other ASIC to continue to function. (So the PoW would be changed.)
Work leasing is the idea that a chip knows who its owner is. It can be programmed with an identity in tamperproof volatile on-chip storage, and it would refuse to work unless the work unit itself was signed by someone authorized to create it. The owner could temporarily lease a certain amount of work or a certain amount of time to a pool or a third-party (like mining software) and the chip would refuse to operate without it.
In this way, colocated datacentres could house your miners and the worst they can do is shut them off: they can't use it to *subvert* your hashrate without your permission except insofar as they could hold their fingers over the power switch and make you do it yourself.
So, centralizing hashrate into a few facilities would be possible.
Sadly, most ASIC manufacturers have their heads too far up their own asses to build machinery that future-proofs Bitcoin and puts power in the hands of the people whose money actually drives the machinery forward.

Well, here are the facts as I currently thought they were..
I've specifically brought this issue up with you, specifically, before in our last discussion about the testnet fork from the btcd-created block. You didn't correct me then.
You can find my un-edited-since-then comment where I mention it to you here:
The user came in complaining about a segfault, described here:
Based on a patch, described here:
In total, if what he said in that as you say out-of-context IRC chat is correct, he has done the following:
* Added runtime.GC() in five locations
* Turned on runtime.MemProfileRate = 1
* *DECREASED* the maxOrphanTransactions size by a factor of 50
* Increase three timeout variables to extra minutes
* Tried to run btcd on an OpenBSD host using a ports-sourced pkg_add. That is, he initially claimed he was not himself patching his Go runtime.
According to the 5.5 ports tree, the following patches are applied to lang/go version 1.2, in summary:
(from 
* linker directive
* increased timespec struct size (x6)
* instructions for go to call in assembly some timing routines and the kevent syscall (setitimer, usleep, etc) (x2)
* A slightly modified route_bsd.go
* a getdirentries() func (x3)
* A patch for OpenBSD syscall return errors which expands known error constants (x2)
* An OpenBSD-specific sysctl struct patch primarily dealing with "how to talk to OpenBSD sysctl"
* An expanded syscall list for OpenBSD (x2)
When ports/ updated to go 1.3, all patches except one went away, because the patches were on cursory examination accepted verbatim into Go 1.3 upstream.
So, are you attributing one of the above patches to a failing Go runtime.GC() segfault? Or can you dispel this supposed misconception of mine by telling me of your discovery that the user was lying?
I, I suspect unlike people who usually argue with you, would be happy to be corrected and will gladly update my opinions with corrected information and data, and I will never claim that btcd segfaults with simple runtime.GC() patches again, if you can honestly tell me this is so, especially if there a bugtracker somewhere where this bug was tracked, analyzed, explained and permanently corrected. Heck, I'll even apologize and correct my entire past commenting history in here. I still won't agree that a mining alt is a good idea, but I'll certainly gladly drop this issue into the trashbin.
I'll reiterate: I am not against alternate implementations. I have stated before that I am explicitly *pro* alternative clients. I myself run a number of heavily-patched versions of bitcoind, and I will be running a number of btcd in remote servers. I think the existence of bitcoinj is a boon to the client ecosystem, as are the various relay clients, seednodes, SPV clients, and other implementations I'm extremely supportive of.
I also fail to grasp your reasoning as to how *additional* implementations that, as you seem to imply, increase forking risk, are better for the ecosystem, nor how mining implementations which increase forking risk strengthen the system against new versions of bitcoind..? Perhaps I'm misunderstanding your vocabulary. It happens.

Please reconsider putting contractual data of this nature in the blockchain, especially using a blockchain spamming service like proofofexistence. There are superior methods of showing some data existed as of some point in time, including namecoin and other merged-mining cryptographic stamping mechanisms, if what you want is to proclaim it.
The reason I say this is because when people signed up to run full nodes in bitcoin, they didn't sign up to store random messages in a distributed datastore: bitcoin is about economic activity and transactions between people involving money or objects of worth.
There isn't much to programmatically include in a smart marriage contract -- can you programmatically design a failure mode? Under what conditions can the contract be annulled? Can your participation in a marriage be purchased? Not really.
I understand that people respect and want to honour their potential mates by making excellent gestures, but wouldn't you agree that being respectful and honourable to something you both love is to treat it respectfully and use a better way of proclaiming your common-law marriage via a stamping mechanism instead of adding to the amount of data that full-nodes have no choice but to store until the end of bitcoin as we know it?

I would also point out that the core dev team themselves were arguing against the inclusion of that, it was merged and then hastily removed, and it *would* have been hastily removed even had Conformal not done a post describing a vulnerability it opened up.

1) Intelligent regulation is likely impossible, but probably welcome by ancaps, and not for the head-in-the-sand reasons normal people will give you. I'll explain: all limits on it, reasonable and thought-out they may be, will simply be pressures to escalate a very simple arms race: the more artificial external constraints are implemented, the more the users who don't like it will be incentivized to build *actual* anonymous crypto-currency with *actual* anonymous p2p underpinnings. CoinValidation, transfer limits, and other mechanisms of control are by-products of a system which appears to have been specifically designed to be initially acceptable to regulatory institutions and governments, while providing a fairly frictionless upgrade path to what I will refer to as the Nightmare Scenario. Ancaps know this: they *want* an overreaction.[1]
2) Go into Freenode IRC, identify yourself to the ops, and idle where they suggest you idle for high signal:noise ratio news. Find someone there who is willing to interpret for you. Do not let anyone act as your filter.
3) I don't. If they knew what ratcheting up the legislation and taking away toys by *directly interfering with those toys* is going to do to push along the creation of bitcoin V2, the over-reaction would be pronounced and immediate.
Bitcoin itself will probably not survive a legislation-based extinction level event. So, I am not talking about Bitcoin. I'm talking specifically about what's to follow, because it's already mostly been designed as intellectual exercises by bored hackers[2].
In my opinion, the incubation of infrastructure which has followed along meekly with the obviously irresistable lure of economic activity and tax money, has ballooned the system out to international proportions. Regulatory-level events absent international consensus equals pressures and incentives to speed along bitcoin's scarier Nightmare Scenario big brother.
No, it's not too late to kill bitcoin. But it's likely too late to guide it into a palatable mass.
[1] I am not an ancap; I do NOT want Nightmare Scenario to come about. That's why I call it Nightmare Scenario.
[2] Traditional, non-popularized sense of the term.

You can't make the claim that btcd runs the *exact same* consensus validation code path unless you literally are using the actual code from bitcoind including dependencies; you and I both know that the side-effects of e.g. the database dependencies could still cause a fork resulting from alternative mining implementation *even if all the codepaths are identical*, *just by using the database layer differently.* Meanwhile btcd is written in another language. How can you say you duplicate the codepaths when just adding some GC() calls triggers a segfault?
Or I dunno, maybe you did in fact tear out the mining innards of bitcoind? I can't seem to find the mining gbt interface in your public github projects. If so, great! My objection is gone, please build us a highly-reliable btcd. I'll run it myself.
Right now you are claiming that your guys, internally, are all perfectly cooperative and that everyone with access to your mining code as of the creation of the reorg'd out 1ec block is equally so. Okay, if you say so. Meanwhile a huge hundreds-of-blocks fork happened because a bunch of hashrate didn't include your btcd's 1ec in its mining consensus.
From the outside perspective, the possibility remains that your unreleased as you say mining code in your main btcd itself, or another btcd, rejected a block for whatever reason and the mining hashrate that was on it began building a parallel fork. Bitcoind core itself of course mostly tried to accept both forks and let the stronger one win.
None of us know what's going on with btcd, who's running mining on testnet3, or why. All outside people know is what they saw bitcoind doing, and how it tracked the forking process. And bitcoind itself choked on the fork *while mining itself continued.* Dozens of people reported their bitcoind couldn't track a fork that large and had to be rebuilt.
This has nothing to do with whether I "like" other mining nodes. My dislike of other mining nodes is a consequence of directly correlated forking dangers of alternative mining code, and I think we both know that. Or, if you don't understand why not only the "codepaths" but also the *unforeseen errors and compatibility problems* could cause forking issues down the road, I respectfully question how you can authoritatively champion mining code written primarily in *another language entirely*.
It is not just the core devs (and other people who don't have a vested interest in seeing the core devs fail).

I'm certainly not wording things in the most negative light possible.
Still, how is it FUD when it's based on publically-known facts, even so far as you know them? I dunno, I'm open to being corrected. I don't think this sort of bug is common. It's just one stupid bug. The issue I have with it is it's a bunch of really trivial patches, the bug's evaluation and analysis was either dropped on the floor or is happening in private, and that is evidence that btcd, or at least its environment, is currently more fragile than your cheerleader buddies here and the OP are technically capable of evaluating.
I dunno. Maybe my opinion isn't so informed? You did flatly state originally that I was plain factually incorrect. Pretty sure I'm not, but maybe right?
You probably shouldn't let rando cheerleader speak with your mouth, though, because he's saying that your new mining software does increase forking risk, but that you *predicate the safety of the system as a whole* on btcd not only being superior software, but *also completely supplanting Bitcoin Core* while letting users deal with the fallout risks of the transition period.
That's unfortunate that you decided to respond at all to what you think is FUD, but then call it too time consuming to deal with when it turns out it's not just rando anti-cheerleader FUD after all. But I do appreciate your implied stance reversal: so, then, you haven't actually analyzed (or perhaps even reproduced) a segfaulting bug after a user patched your code? I personally wouldn't liken a runtime.GC() to a free(nil) in C++. (I perhaps wrongly assume you meant free(NULL). Which does nothing.)
* The bug hasn't been analyzed. (That sounds pretty mysterious to me. I dunno. Maybe you know something I don't and just don't want to tell me because it takes too much time.)
* You *don't* actually know whether the Go runtime was modified in a btcd-breaking way, but you stated it was.
* You don't appear have a public bug URL where I can watch the progress, discussion, hypotheses, analyses, fixes, or test-cases which address this bug specifically.
* The reported bug was May 15, about three months ago.
* You don't actually know whether the OS kernel itself is a source of the problem, but you stated it was.
* You don't actually know whether the trivial patch is the source of the problem, but you state it was, rather than just saying *"dunno, nobody can repro it, user disappeared, it's OpenBSD ports/, what do you expect of alpha software?"*
If it's such a waste of time dealing with me, why bother doing it? Who cares? Perhaps, as you imply, I'm just some rando nobody, who's not really contributing meaningfully to the ecosystem. Just let your cheerleaders continue making you look bad on their own, because everyone knows they're just echo-chambering anyway. Besides, did you read those issues you're linking to?
* 4242 is a non-critical bug with Warren repeatedly setting the setgenerate boolean to true as fast as the machine could do it
* 4345 was a user's *hardware faulting* which *corrected itself after he underclocked his machine*
* 4516 was a *user manually destroying the underlying database files*
* 4628 was a devline segfault which was analyzed, fixed, and tested in 24 hours
* 4703 was a reported fault which occurs while interacting with a closed-source Microsoft kernel
* 4774 was an XML problem with the Chinese translation which was analyzed and corrected in less than 4.5 hours.

Chronobit works, is superior to this for granularity, and doesn't irritatingly bloat the blockchain.
Putting it into a merged-mining chain like namecoin (which is better for it) doesn't bloat the primary blockchain and is trivially more simple than even this online service.
DO NOT USE this service. This is blockchain graffiti.
(And before you say "it doesn't bloat because it's OP_RETURN", what you're describing doesn't bloat the UTXO. The blockchain itself in totality is still bloated, forever.)

So it is fixed? You don't need to ping the user then? Or did the user get back to you with an answer? Are you telling me you knew it all along? Why didn't you just tell me it was a sysctl from the start?
Where did Conformal track this bug? Was it just in IRC?
*Which sysctl was it?*
Is the segfault reproducible with this sysctl?
Why were you calling a "custom" sysctl a "custom kernel"? Is it just a sysctl setting, or is it an actually patched OpenBSD kernel that has another sysctl that none of the rest of us do?
Why were you blaming a patched Go runtime when *those same patches were accepted nearly verbatim into Go upstream*? Are you blaming Go 1.3 now?
Why were you blaming the user's patches *when it turns out it was a sysctl*?
Don't you think the possibility that if we *set the wrong sysctl, we risk a btcd segfault* is kind of important for your users to know? "Hey, don't set this sysctl or else any effort you do to reduce btcd memory footprint could unpredictably segfault our code. Also we'll blame you for it. Plus your environment is unsupported."
What you're doing right now is called special pleading. "This segfault(!) was just some thing that I'm not going to tell you about or even really define."
    /mirrors/git/conformal-btcd$ git log | grep -Ei '(sysctl|openbsd|segfault|kernel)'
    /mirrors/git/conformal-btcd$ git rev-parse HEAD
    9cecf1dc2e6c00d67987ae50b0016d9b647ae860
I have a bone to pick, of course I do, because Conformal's code and your inscrutable process is risking the mining ecosystem in ways you claim to be aware of, but then contradict yourself by saying the risks will make us safer. This bug is not the only thing I have a problem with, and we both know that.
I'm not here to be cooperative and play nice with you. Whenever Conformal's mindless echo chamber claims credit for you for Bitcoin Core's hard work, when Conformal's own commits don't include the courtesy of a pointer to the original code they were modelled on, the Core devs' hands are tied, because everything they do that isn't WWJD perfect, they get mercilessly attacked by either Conformal, or their supporters. And you do *nothing* to stop it when you have plenty of opportunity, and, apparently, the time to do so.
Conformal continues to encourage an echo-chamber filled with liars spreading lies, like this Reddit post. You don't see a problem with that? You're here now. And you're encouraging them. Why are you doing that? You "wasted" all this time writing to me, and you couldn't be arsed to tell the OP that he's being an idiot?
I'm going to continue to tell people that btcd is a *bad idea to run in a mining capacity for the foreseeable future.* Really bad. Ecosystem-wrecking bad.
If btcd couldn't mine and submit its potentialy broken blocks all by itself to the network, and if the verbose members of the btcd echo chamber propaganda machine *which you refuse to shut down but instead feed and agree with*, didn't spread this nonsense this discussion wouldn't be happening and I'd be donating effort to your project.
Are you really so afraid to lose the support of your insane echo chamber that you don't see that dropping them on their arse will *gain you the support of better people*? (Note: I am not referring to myself.)
Seriously, if this is such a waste of your time, I really do hope you stop responding to me.

Right. First off, I'd like to apologise for going off on you. That was rude. I thought you were being extremely rude so I didn't feel the need to be civil anymore myself. I'm not so sure anymore.


"I still won't agree that a mining alt is a good idea" &lt;-- I thought I was being fairly obvious..?




I will be happy to no longer claim btcd segfaults with random runtime.GC() calls added to it, just that there is evidence it is currently fragile and crashy under environmental memory pressure. Fair enough?


I kept bringing it up because you weren't being clear, I'm not a mind-reader, and in spite of the voluminous public information available none of your analyses were. As far as I can tell the patched Go runtime had nothing to do with it; a user-injected free(unallocated) had nothing to do with it; and there was no custom kernel involved.


Doh. Did your guys really just start working on a potentially data-destroying bug without recording all that data the user provided in a bug tracker somewhere? :-( My hypothesis that you just have an internal bug tracker somewhere is a more attractive idea.


Come on now. :) Setting a bufcachepercent sysctl does not customize your kernel.






.. but you did blame the patched Go runtime, more than once.


Well. I'm sure (now) you're not on a crusade but I couldn't tell after you did this:


*... proceeds to link to corner-case thread-unsafe torture-testing, user hardware failure, a user deliberately destroying underlying databases, and two bugs that were analyzed and fixed in 4.5-24 hours*


No, now I'm saying that what you *were* saying made absolutely no sense. free(unallocated) still makes no sense. Even so, yes, almost every application that segfaults is the fault of the application.


If Bitcoin Core *segfaults* under memory pressure then it **is** a problem with BC and it needs to be fixed.
Besides, your user's fault wasn't the sort of segfault you are describing. Look at the fault report.. The user's fault was a bus error (0xa) that occurred in runtime/mprof.goc in setaddrbucket(), with code 0x3. That's an object error on OpenBSD..


No, I said 'when.' That doesn't imply 'never.' Do btcd logs give credit every time Conformal copies from reference?


I was going entirely on your (now obviously) erroneous description of the bug. You never said anything about a memory pressure nor a sysctl. Certainly not a user hardware fault (which has nothing to do with anything.) Now that you've actually described the real problem without using erroneous assertions and analogies, yes, I do understand that memory pressures under user control were probably a primary factor.


Sure. First, I'll correct your out-of-context quote. In case you missed it, I *also* said, 'You "wasted" all this time writing to me, and you couldn't be arsed to tell the OP that he's being an idiot?'


He posts basically pure inflammatory nonsense.


Ah, cool then. I will be sure to link to your post to shut these people down then. Thank you for saying that, I appreciate it.


I do not consider that a weakness of your software. That's just a missing feature, the road to which appears to be well-mapped out.

It is not identical. One came into use and existed before it was destroyed.

They are not equal; the fees are an amount which only exists because people spent them into their transactions. The raw coinbase amount itself is the block reward of new coins which could have come into being.
Since I threw away an amount which was greater than the fees, not only were these fees thrown away, but *a piece of the block reward was thrown away too.*
If I had only thrown away one Satoshi above the maximum possible reward, then I could only just *say* I threw away a Satoshi for the sake of Satoshi. Here, there is no other amount *the origin from which it could have come except the coinbase reward to begin with.*

The dangers of a &gt;50% attack are very real, and very important. Recent papers suggest that even a 28% or so majority is extremely dangerous.
But nobody seems to care. The Bitcoin devs *have* been beating the drum for like four years and more! Nobody listens! Because they don't care.

Second off, your method of argumentation and rhetoric is petty and you are being deliberately insulting. Why would anyone "submit" to some kind of leading framing you are trying to set up? The wording itself is something literally nobody would willingly or happily do. All it shows is that it's a waste of time arguing with you, except for the fact that others whose minds aren't galvanized against meaningful discourse may also be reading.


Don't be absurd. Of course they're looking for a return on investment. I'll explain your problem to you: Your issue is that *you can't comprehend how money could be made by people while also contributing positively to Bitcoin.* Your statement itself implies that *it is either Blockstream, or Bitcoin* who benefits, which is *a perfect example* of a false dichotomy. So, really, let me paraphrase you: "I lack the imagination to think of a way that both Blockstream and Bitcoin could succeed together, and I have swallowed deeply the echo-chamber propaganda that analyzes pre-existing opinions as fresh corporate conspiracy."


This is the part where you completely neglect to show any link whatsoever, hand-wave it away by implying that *only a great fool or a paid shill* could possibly think that a for-profit corporation could have literally tied its success to the success of Bitcoin itself, while being completely oblivious to the fact that everyone who thinks so might be perfectly reasonable about it, *while you simply lack the ability to see a way by which it could be so.*


This is a very incorrect comment. A tiny fraction of Blockstream even works on Bitcoin anymore, thanks to ingrates like yourself whose outward paranoia is fed by echo-chambers powered by *other, much less benevolent* corporate interests whose *only aim* is to do the *only thing they know how to do* to increase Bitcoin price, when in reality this forced hardforking, libellous nonsense is just another political attack taking advantage of the backdoor of anger most people have about the disproportionate power that corporations have classically exercised to the detriment of human well-being. Worse, this classical thinking is precisely the reason why both the more egregious problem of mining centralization isn't front-and-centre (they don't think it's a problem,) and the léger de main of redirection from the harm being done by the teams people like you support is being ignored completely.

You would have done better to actually quote him.
"If the network were to get that big[...]"
He used a conditional. In other places, Satoshi explicitly stated that Bitcoin could "[...]win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years."
And that that territory of freedom would grow to be either very large in 20 years, or go to 0 in 20 years.
He never actually said Bitcoin should or would replace VISA.

Your statement is circular. Read back like three parents ago. If each user defines what alert keys he trusts *on his own* then how can the trust be transitive to *other nodes entirely*?!
Alerts are not transactions (currently.)

Your point is irrelevant.
There is nothing faster than "impossible for bitcoin to be faster than." If you accept that Bitcoin *can never be faster* than Liquid, then you must accept that *the repeated mantra that bitcoin blocks are full* has literally *nothing to do with Liquid's value as an inter-account transfer mechanism.*
And, that *bitcoin being slower or faster than it currently is at confirming tx literally has no effect on the crushing advantage people would have if Liquid were deployed.*

He's relying on *us* to fill in factual, correct information, while implying that Gavin gave away *his own money.* As in, if it was a gift, then it had to be owned to begin with.
And you are mistaken. Your perception of the people attacking Gavin's *actions* is a generalization that is false, and fails to acknowledge credit to the hundreds of other people whose donations *also* powered the faucet.
The OP is asking a leading question which presumes something is true which isn't. How is that not a troll? lol
@_date: 2016-03-01 09:17:07
You would have done better to actually quote him.
"If the network were to get that big[...]"
He used a conditional. In other places, Satoshi explicitly stated that Bitcoin could "[...]win a major battle in the arms race and gain a new territory of freedom for several years."
And that that territory of freedom would grow to be either very large in 20 years, or go to 0 in 20 years.
He never actually said Bitcoin should or would *replace* VISA.
But you're welcome to pretend you can interpret ambiguous statements however you like. We both know I was referring to people whose actual aims are to grow Bitcoin into a VISA replacement. We now know this is not compatible with maintaining decentralization and user privacy.

It's already built directly into the nature of the product. There is nothing that could be faster in Bitcoin without destroying its PoW roots; therefore, it is irrelevant whether bitcoin itself has mostly empty blocks or not. It is literally impossible for anyone using normal bitcoin, *no matter the scenario* to compete with someone who can utilize Liquid to speed up bitcoin balance transfers between participating exchanges.
Therefore, *it doesn't matter* whether Bitcoin has 2MB blocks or even 20MB blocks or not. At all. Liquid is a *fundamental technological superiority for this specific purpose.*
So you see, the silly nonsense about Liquid being some kind of competitor is just that. Silly nonsense.

Did any of those blocks *throw away enough to reduce the total reward to less than the possible block reward?*
I am aware that many miners threw away fees.
If they did not reduce their reward to *less than the base block reward*, then I am alone. As far as I know, there are no other blocks which claimed less than the actual block reward itself allowed.
But I would love to see an actual example of such so I can mock someone else who did it too.

I'll requote that:


Yes. Yes, it is slow. Even with checkpoints. The UTXO arrived before 2013. It was sipa's change, likely somewhere around Jul 2012, commitid 450cbb0944cd20a06ce806e6679a1f4c83c50db2.
You go ahead and try with core before then and see how far you get. Better yet, try one of Satoshi's original clients.
So, the argument is, since you seem to have forgotten it:
"Without the performance improvements in Bitcoin from core, we would not be able to sync the blockchain."
It's not, "The core client from two years ago can't sync the blockchain."
It is in part that they can *sort of spend bitcoin* without running a full node. However, for those who know about the privacy implications, they *would run a full node if they could but they can't.*
Note that our assertions are orthogonal. You are saying, "More people are using bitcoin, so I'm going to derive an unrelated conclusion from this fact."
Since the node count *has decreased*, logically even if *literally no new people started using bitcoin from the last time it measurably decreased,* the nodes *many people were running have now shut down.*
Web wallets have been around *literally since the beginning.*
And, fwiw, there is no such thing as an SPV client.
We are *not* approaching the point where a full node can run on a smartphone. A full node, especially with the segwit and/or -classic hardfork block increase, will *probably never usefully be able to run in full archival node mode on a smartphone.*
@_date: 2016-03-10 03:02:15
Way to move the goalposts again. So, what, are we talking gossip'd nodes, listening nodes, estimated full node counts..? What?
If you want to talk about listening nodes, while as I said there was a code change (IIRC) that shut off UPNP hole-punching by default, the decline is significant: 50,000k listening nodes in 2011 versus a maximum spike of 9k in Feb 2014, to..  how many now? One of the seed node operators says 4500 or so stable.

A Raspberry Pi can't run a node. That is a lie.
This is an image of the time it takes a normal raspberry pi to sync the blockchain. The exponential time increases will shortly overtake the pi's ability to keep up.

Because it's too late.

@_date: 2016-03-07 03:41:24
I'm pretty sure you haven't. In any event, have you *actually been sitting there helping thousands of people run full nodes, from 2010 onwards*?
No? It's amusing to find that people like yourself demand strong statistical correlation when we both know that *the demand itself invalidates anything you say as much as it purports to invalidate what I say.*
By the simple fact that I *do not demand such statistical rigour* I am stating that *I am willing to accept something less than academic statistical rigour.*
And I'm mocking you for demanding it, because you *didn't offer such academic rigour in your original assertion that popularity would increase node count.* lol In essence you are saying, "You need it because you're arguing with me. I don't need it because I'm me." And then getting mad at me for not supplying it.
The facts aren't really disputable:
1) Node count has decreased.
2) Bitcoin popularity has *significantly increased.*
Therefore, you are wrong. Popularity will *not* increase node count.

Your merchants haven't gotten the word, or are too afraid to go against the credit card monopolies, the way that other merchants have, thanks to exhorbitant percentage fees they must pay but shouldn't have to.
And they do, in fact, price the costs of doing business into their goods. That includes credit card fees.
You think you don't, but since you are the source of the merchant's cash flow, you do in fact supply the money from which the fee is extracted by the credit card companies. So "the merchant" pays, but since "the merchant" does not generate money from thin air, but from you, "the merchant" passes this cost on to you. You would be paying less if the merchant did not add the VISA fees to the prices of the things you buy from them.
For all these reasons, *you* pay the credit card fees.
To think otherwise is to be stubbornly obtuse about cash flow in business.
Additionally, when you use cash, for all the above reasons, you are *subsidizing my use of credit cards*. Thanks for that. Please keep paying cash to keep my prices lower.

@_date: 2016-03-09 00:05:02


You're still being disingenuous.
Let's presume for the moment that e.g. listening node counts dropping over time is not representative due to code changes disabling UPNP by default; that the bitnodes.io crawler was wildly inaccurate *just because it took a while to crawl the network*; that spammed addresses are likely; that the lists of nodes that blockchain.info is connected to, while also shrinking, is not representative; that people like Gavin Andresen are incorrect when they're describing node counts shrinking; that even back in the beginning with the multi-thousands of nodes in the 100+ subchannels on IRC for peer discovery was not representative of early node counts; that somehow your evaluation of node counts is more accurate than the people *running the actual bitcoin seed nodes and the core developers themselves*; that you have access to an ability to project back to 2010 the current few-months upward trend; that the -classic devs and supporters *aren't sybil'ing the network with cheap datacentre-hosted nodes*..
In that case, not only can *I* not make the claim that node count is decreasing, but you can't make the claim that they are *increasing*. In other words, the very graphs you are describing are unreliable, since none of the data is reliable.
Realistically, all node counts are estimates, since nobody can reliably crawl the entire network, since many nodes are dark nodes and can only be inferred via special traffic analysis techniques that aren't going on on an on-going basis, but are short-term (such as amiller's work for example on de-anonymizing nodes.)
Luckily, I *am in fact right* and *you are in fact wrong* because we were hitting connection exhaustion with *50,000 reachable nodes on the network in 2011.*
That is, there were 50,000 IP addresses which were acting as nodes and accepting connections from people. Even if literally every single node in existence were actually a listening node (which it wasn't) that fact right there means we're one base-10 order of magnitude down from *2011.*
I'll also note that *your original assertion:*


... literally has *less evidence to support it*. You are calling price a primary driver, but price is not a driver. *Price* is not the reason why more people *run nodes.*

Try to predict what you think are the most likely hashrate increases *on average* in the next 420,000 - (current) blocks. Currently this yields about 7-8 retargets. If you think that hashrate *added* to the global consensus could average about 5% for the entire 7-8 retargets, then your *magic number* is going to be 0.95. If you think on average it will stay the same, or lose 5%, then your magic numbers will be 1, or 1.05 respectively.
Once you pick your magic number, plug it in to the following command-line:
    COUNT=$( bitcoin-cli getblockcount ); TZ=UTC date --date=" echo $( date +%s ) + \( $( echo "scale=0;(210000-(${COUNT}%210000))/2016 * 2 * 7"|bc -l ) \* 24 \* 60 \* 60 \) \* 0.95 | bc -l )"
Note the "0.95" there. Plug your magic number into that value.
*All* of these sites that are pretending they are predicting the halving date should be explicitly revealing how they are calculating this date, and how they are estimating their hashrate increases until that time.
If they don't, it's just a pointless, hand-waving guess and they should be ignored. It's a prediction lottery. The Price Is Right.
At the moment, the above command-line returns the result:

You can encourage them to do so, as not doing so externalizes costs. It is not solely my blockchain. The blockchain belongs to all of us. I am one of the few people who will be running a full node for the foreseeable future. But the fewer people who are willing to do this thanks to bloat such as this, over time, the less security there is for the network as a whole.
This is not just my subjective opinion. Are you happy about storing a bunch of bloated gambling that was likely just spam that originated from the SD owners themselves? Are you happy to lug around all those hundreds of MB forever, for as long as you run a full node?
Users don't sign up to store arbitrary data. None of the developers encourage the use of Bitcoin to store arbitrary data. There are virtually no users who, if they were given the choice, would store arbitrary data that does not represent economic transactions.
So you can pretend that I'm some kind of dictator who knows better, but it's irrelevant, because the opposite (that you are some kind of pro-freedom user who, in doing something *just because he can* is therefore doing *the right thing*) is certainly not true.

Throwing away fees is not the same as *reducing the coinbase payout underneath the block reward.*
In one case, you're throwing away fees or provably destroying coins. All those people using OP_RETURN to spam pointless crap against the will of the network into the blockchain are also destroying bitcoins. A *lot* of coins have been provably destroyed. You can get a summary of the current total right from the command-line.
In the other case, you are *stopping some coins from ever coming into existence in the first place.*

No; node count has decreased because people think full nodes take up too many resources and it takes too long to sync the blockchain.
It does not perform better than it did years ago, in the sense that it takes orders of magnitude longer time to sync the blockchain than it did years ago, on identical hardware, even with all the improvements made to core.
@_date: 2016-03-19 17:48:43
I'll simplify. One miner sends one broken block out to headers-first mining installations. The headers-first miners then extend them, and in a certain percentage of the time, multiple blocks grow long enough before being invalidated that users who presume N confirmations is safe can no longer rely on the optimistic presumption that miners are extending a canonical chain. Now, reorgs are likely to be bigger and therefore more dangerous.
I don't think yous ideas can work because none of the full nodes has direct communication with *all* the other nodes; and incompatible segmented work chains won't relay sibling blocks between each other.
Validation-delayed is effectively *validation-free* mining until the block is validated, and in a significant number of cases, multiple blocks will be built on top of the original block before validation can be completed.
You yourself are describing a scenario in which N confirmations would now be calculated as Y risky, differently than we do now. Y risky is *more risky* than current risk. This is bad. :-) Why implement something which *hurts* security and *increases* risk?
Instead of current assumptions, after headers-first, we must then examine blocks and decide how to calculate risk based on blocks contents.
This effectively *massively decreases* hashrate effectiveness, just as validation-free mining (which in their case was just delayed-validation) proved it did for the BIP66 fork.

I don't need to prove it. They're saying they're doing it right there in the dev channels, on IRC, and advertising the services to -classic supporters.
Negative nodes..? Crazy logic, bro.
It has been going down since its first major popularity increase, very early on. From tens, possibly hundreds of thousands, to just a few thousand, now.
Price going downwards doesn't have much to do with it. People's inability to run nodes is what it has to do with now.
I've watched them. The single largest stumbling block right now for following the technical experts' advice (run a full node) is that it takes too long to sync, and requires too much room.
Altcoins are orthogonal. Most of them are described as scamcoins, most of them are in fact scamcoins, most of them are written by people who are incompetent to be writing bitcoin-like currency applications, and nearly all of them rely singularly on Bitcoin's core devs to filter down expertise, exploit protections, features, and especially ideas.
I am a mod of a channel with literally thousands of real clients connected to it; ( hierarchy on Freenode) and have been watching people since 2010 install nodes, and give up. There were many requests for help. Then there were only some. And then there were almost none.
This corresponds with published node counts.

It is not identical. One came into use an existed before it was destroyed.
One never arrived to begin with.
They are not equal; the fees are an amount which only exists because people spent them into their transactions. The raw coinbase amount itself is the block reward of new coins which could have come into being.
Since I threw away an amount which was greater than the fees, not only were these fees thrown away, but *a piece of the block reward was thrown away too.*
If I had only thrown away one Satoshi above the maximum possible reward, then I could only just *say* I threw away a Satoshi for the sake of Satoshi. Here, there is no other amount *the origin from which it could have come except the coinbase reward to begin with.*
So yes, I did, in fact, throw away a piece of the coinbase/block reward.

The result of headers-first mining is a number of other things, including a fork-amplification attack that destroys the current risks of N confirmations being Y safe.

So, *convergence* is harmed by headers-first mining.

Of course I don't expect development to stay stationary. In fact, it hasn't been stationary for six years. If it were, *literally none of us would be able to sync the blockchain.*
His description of SPV has never been implemented, and he was wrong about bandwidth costs and increases in capacity. He didn't actually say it could have; this is where you are wrong.

This isn't quite correct. Karpeles worked closely with the bitcoin developers early on and had regular contact with them about technical issues MtGox was experiencing over time. At some point in the middle, or near the end of MtGox, Karpeles was no longer doing so, and began doing odd things like blaming the core devs for the malleability issue and claiming this issue was the origin of the funds losses. Of course this wasn't true.
Still, early on when MtGox was very young, he was always on IRC and always talking to people, and the devs. And even to people like me. *And participating, to some extent, in the development process.*

700+ IPv6 nodes behind Choopa.com's AS, once identified, suddenly dropped from the website that was counting them as legitimate nodes that the classic supporters were pointing to as proof they were winning..  some kind of popularity contest.
*Surely* someone would realize that using all those identical nodes behind Choopa wouldn't help their cause? And yet there it was. Evidence of a huge sybil attack. The AWS nodes are still there, though a cursory analysis suggests hundreds even of them are identically sybils since not only are multiple nodes paid-for by single individuals, but the guy putting them up is doing it *on behalf of a bunch of other people.*
So, effectively, that guy has one replicated node that other people are paying for.
This *entire time* even people like the Pirate Party Rick Falkvinge was pointing to *this exact data point* on his Twitter feed as evidence of a massive change!
Dude. That's Rick Falkvinge.
So, given the above, is pointing out falsehoods and reinforcing the point that *our analyses about classic nodes being comprised primarily of sybils* now gauche?

He didn't actually build a client from scratch. He built a client by duplicating as much code from the reference client as he could -- right up to having trouble (these are his words, by the way) understanding a heap traversal Satoshi had written by bit-shifting so the code could be properly replicated and integrated in Java.
That is, his full understanding was *not required*.
Things like thin blocks are not innovations in the sense that the other developers who are *implementing them* are the origin of the *idea being implemented.* In fact, most or nearly all of the ideas being implemented by the other developer teams *originated or were originally dreamed up* by people before them.
I am very interested in such a list of *specific innovations* that *originated with and have actually been successfully implemented by the same people.*

You do not seem to be able to understand English.
There is more data, and more complexity now, then there was years ago. Without the performance improvements, we literally would not be able to sync the blockchain.
When I say "in the sense that," what I am referring to is the fact that because of the additional data, *even with the improvements,* it is pointlessly slow even on modern hardware. I have been helping thousands of people install and run bitcoin for six years: I am moderator of a thousands-of-real-clients  channel hierarchy on Freenode. It is, in essence, the "front door" for user help, and (currently) the mostly-official IRC presence of the project.
I'm telling you from direct personal, easy-triangulated experience, people are not running nodes for the simple fact that it takes up too much room, and takes up too many computing resurces, especially now that they "don't have to."

Then don't. If you report you have indeed lost them, I'll add your name for you.
And in many cases there *is* a way to prove the bitcoins have been lost. Satoshi's coins are probably not Satoshi's coins. Still, if you believe they are, then the evidence should be just about as strong to you as the evidence that a bunch of bitcoins are lost.
In part we can use the list to decide how many bitcoins remain, which is an important figure to know to estimate actual bitcoin losses, and project exactly how far we can expect there to continue to *be* bitcoins in the future.

This idea is refuted by the historical correlation between node count, and hashrate centralization, and this "network effect" as you're describing it. According to history, even if you think the "network effect" of increasing Bitcoin utilization could be increased to some weird magical point where the tiny percentage of users willing and able to run real full nodes was greater than the attrition rate, *this hasn't happened in six years of exponential growth,* so optimistically pretending that pushing *even harder* will fix things is kind of like bashing your head against the wall again *because maybe this time it won't hurt.*
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:44:15
False. MtGox code would happily spend coins which hadn't matured yet, and when the withdrawal would fail, they would issue a second tx.
On top of that, MtGox invested (initially) heavily in mining operations explicitly with the aim of being able to prioritize their own transactions.
Near the end especially, withdrawing BTC was rapidly becoming harder, and many of the problems were MtGox themselves and Karpeles shitty code.

It's trivial to do that.
Timestamps are limited backwards by the medium of the last.. mm.. 11 blocks?

No. This is the lie they want you to believe.
BTU includes code which was broken the moment it was introduced, and designed by people who insisted that a 64-bit collision that reduced Xthin utility to negative couldn't be found by single-workstation grinding *even while someone was demonstrating they could find it within minutes of dozens and dozens of challenges on-demand right here on Reddit.*
BTU includes code which disables transaction verification on blocks that self-report 24-hour-old-and-greater timestamps. This means miners, in BTU, can *steal Satoshi's money.* This was likely implemented because BTU devs know for a fact that should miners increase blocks beyond some small value the software would no longer be capable of keeping up with full verification.
BTU includes plenty of code with trivial vulnerabilities in it. The reason why it hasn't been universally analyzed and properly secured is because that effort and process is already being applied to a better client, with better engineering, better process, and superior workmanship, and people who read BTU code instantly realize that it is a political device and a technical non-starter. This is **instantly** obvious to anyone reading that mess of a code patch. The fact that most people don't know how to read code is literally the **only** reason why this zombie keeps lurching onwards.

The "deicison-making" he refers to is lengthening the chain—not changing the rules. His code, Section 8 in the whitepaper, and his further statements in forums show clearly that **rule changes** are not what hashrate is meant to represent changes to.
The second quote does not presage pooled mining whatsoever, neither is that short-term while the network is small enough that home users can still run nodes. (Which it still is.) **Accelerating** the point to which home users can no longer run nodes would **accelerate** the point at which it is no longer a *peer to peer* cash system.

*There is no such thing as an accurate measurement.*
This is a falsehood. Your measurements are going to be modified by current network conditions, usage by other users, and the ability of miners, or like-minded programmers who offer ways of filtering your spam from the network to a wider variety of miners.
This singular test is pointless, and irrelevant. Your measurements will be outdated and unreliable literally upon completion of the test. If you hide your transactions, then how are people going to be able to verify the votes? Do you think literally every voter or user of your system is going to keep quiet about their votes being represented in which  transactions are represented?
I see you are also somewhat misinformed as to chain analysis possibilities. If you are able to hide your tx, and effectively obscure your wallet cluster, and your opsec is perfect, I would be very surprised given you appear to be ignorant of superior, more chain-friendly, and higher-quality and cleverer, mechanisms for stamping or anchoring data to the Bitcoin blockchain to benefit from the enormous hashpower's conference of immutability.
I would also point out that if your business model relies on deceiving the community whose efforts you are depending on to ensure the immutable permanent storage of your data forever, there is a flaw in it, and your VCs should probably be made aware of this vulnerability in it.
"Vulnerability assessment update: The community may mobilize what they are calling anti-spam filtration which may impede our voting mechanism. If we fail at opsec ever, our forms of minimal transactions will be identified and filtered."
Additionally, I find it somewhat ironic that when I point out that you are being needlessly spammy with the blockchain, your defence is a threat to obfuscate into the noise of normal transactions.
Sure, that's an option for you if you are capable of that level of opsec. Why then are you framing it as a threat if you think you aren't doing anything wrong?
Wouldn't you jump at the opportunity to reduce your footprint on the blockchain to a single transaction? (Or less?) Why aren't you?


Also, this is a falsehood. This is mostly a lie. Even if it isn't, the design of your system, similar to timestamping mechs, requires literally no more than a single, aggregated submission of a single transaction of totally otherwise incomprehensible data into the blockchain *per day*. If that.

That is an old, settled argument. Old, old, old.
The problem is twofold: 1) you don't appear to mean the same thing as I do when I say "spam transactions." 2) By my meaning of the term "spam," no full-node operators are interested in bearing the long-term storage costs to carry around the entirety of everyone's pointless, silly usage of the blockchain. That is, the spam transactions do not represent peer-to-peer economic activity in the same sense that real transactions do, and therefore since no full-node operators wish to bear this cost, the storage of it is *non-consensual*. Nobody signed up to store pointlessly bad "proof of existence" data.
Therefore, it is wrong.
In some cases, it also represents criminal activity, as for example what Satoshidice was doing when Voorhees was deliberately asking people to help him DDoS the blockchain and the network by making use of the small-amount SD betting addresses, while simultaneously breaking US online gambling laws by offering the service freely to Americans.
Even if some substantial portion of people who run full nodes *were interested in storing your definition of spam tx* I think we can agree that *criminal activity, if it was going on on the blockchain, is not anything full-node operators would want to support by storing, if they had a choice.*
Let me put it this way.

@_date: 2017-03-11 00:04:40
There is no difference, similarly, to handing consensus parameters over to any government agency. Or any one individual. Or any corporation. Or any society.

This is a lie. Section 8, paragraph 2 shows that hashrate which violates the consensus rules is considered invalid. How can overwhelming hashrate be used to determine **rule changes** if hashrate itself is not the determinant of correct rules?
Furthermore, you are reducing the definition of validity to a social consensus model, since the decision as to validity (or not) of e.g. stealing all of Satoshi's coins is similarly not one that should by itself be left to hashrate—except this is precisely what BTU does.
Therefore, your notion of this is logically inconsistent both with Satoshi's **code** and with Satoshi's **whitepaper and writing.**

This is incorrect. You are not guaranteed to get coins on both sides of the fork.

I'd meant to say that Antpool wouldn't be arguing with everyone and expressing *support* for classic-type blocks. Our main disadvantage w.r.t communication with China is that they speak Mandarin (or another dialect) and we don't. Of course it *appears* they act in concert. Obviously this is not true. Chinese are people just like us. They argue and complain at one another *just the same as we do.*

You are obviously missing the criminal harassment, stalking, dox'ing, and other activity. Literally masses of socks appear simply just to insult nullc. Entire posts are posted explicitly to call core devs criminals, to lie about Adam Back, to threaten (as user "pagex" did) physical violence. The echo chamber then attacks anyone who disagrees.
Explicit, long-form argument and reason is dismissed, as in when I explicitly and completely debunked the lie that nullc misappropriated commit credit due to a github bug. The liars who posted that lie originally failed completely to update their opinion after I debunked it completely.
Whatever you're looking at, it isn't the history or r\btc.


This is a lie. I have debunked that as well. Section 8, paragraph 2 describes invalid blocks as being invalid *outside of hashrate.* That is, consensus rules are a validity-enforcing mechanism that exists outside of hashrate. And, in fact, the code has behaved exactly like that since Satoshi released it, and for seven years.
Therefore, hashrate determining **rule changes** is a recent reinterpretation which is absurdly at odds with Satoshi's idea, but this absurdity is not something which is obvious to people who can't read code, so it gets repeated by people without much thought.
@_date: 2016-01-04 07:42:53
It is enough that you can tell us the information is not available to you.
The ramifications of releasing private *meeting minutes* (IMO different from conversations) are simple: the law will not help us. Therefore, it is ethical and moral to examine records which are *made public* as a consequence of *questionable and probably illegal* activity on the part of the prior board, so that if there is criminal or at least civilly-actionable material, we can hold those people personally accountable for mismanagement of *the funding we gave them in good faith.*
You don't have to apologise, and I am not blaming you. You don't have to do anything. I was merely hoping you *could* do something, and to try to convince you to do it. You closed that door, mostly, and in a very interesting way (thank you for your candour,) so I guess I can just ask you to speak to the former secretary(ies) and find out where they put the records they were supposed to be keeping.
I would offer that your carpet stains were not something you and hundreds like you paid for direct out of pocket by professional people who are, were, or will hopefully be in the future, in jail.

Due to miner centralization, I'm very surprised indeed that said centralized miners are so willing to put their proverbial necks on the chopping block for control of some of Bitcoin's consensus parameters—in the hypothetical world where said miners have control of consensus parameters, as you imply, people who want to nefariously control those parameters have a target.
..boggling that they would willingly go along with that.
..even more boggling that users would go along with that given that there's no such thing as a private enterprise in China. It is all, ostensibly, state-owned. Since that is the case, and the majority hashrate is in China, people who go along with BU are in essence handing not only control of majority hashrate, but then *also consensus parameters* to the Chinese government.
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:30:38
.. what the code says it is..? This hasn't really been broken in 7 or 8 years.
And I am saying that your definition of what consensus is, is not the "consensus" of the code, nor the whitepaper, nor.. well I mean what else matters?

@_date: 2017-03-21 05:29:04


BTU, contrary to Mike Hearn's and Gavin's original complaints, hands **additional** power to miners by letting them choose network consensus parameters which were up until now static.
In this case, putting it in the hands of Chinese corporate monoliths is exactly the same as giving it to the Chinese government, since there's no such thing as a private company in China.
@_date: 2017-03-29 21:53:36


By BTU's definition, there can be no attacker, since the greatest hashrate defines the rules which were, up until btu, hard-coded consensus parameters.
That is, because S.8 describes an attacker's blocks as *inconsistent,* it therefore explicitly defines the existence of rules for consistency—and in fact, the code he released bore this interpretation out, because it didn't follow hashrate as the determinant of any consensus parameters which otherwise would have required a hardfork to change—or literally any rule mutability, really, which depended on hashrate.
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:45:00


It is not a vote on **rule changes.** It is a vote on chain extension **within the rules.**
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:14:26


Literally you could have done exactly the same "low" bandwidth anchoring you're doing in Bitcoin right now, in another way while maintaining literally the same protections afforded to the Bitcoin blockchain, while **literally** offloading almost all of your data and at a sacrifice of a small amount of granularity. Literally the only reason you're using Bitcoin is to coat-tail the popularity. Why aren't you using similar methods on an Ethereum chain? Your reasons are false.

Attempting to accelerate a distant future which Satoshi considered, by handing power and control **over consensus parameters** to miners is not something he anticipated, or built into any code, or even direction, ever.
Misquoting him by excising Section 8 (which defines validity as a quality outside of hashrate) is a logical inconsistency and therefore false.

No. That "nodes growing" is an artifact of a sybil attack currently being effected on the network because people have been told that running a node is like voting for "consensus". Whatever they think that means.
The higher price does not increase node count. It hasn't in the past. The overall trend has always been downward. Considering we are literlly a few *orders of magnitude* fewer nodes than were running in the beginning, a small uptick now is *completely irrelevant*. Which you should know if you expect to usefully argue about it.

Software engineering experience clearly shows that this divergence is **not tenably fixable** the longer it is left alone. It is **inevitable** that the BTU codebase will simply keep falling over itself the longer they allow it to diverge like this. This is one of the reasons why this exploit exists in the first place.

Leaving aside the simple fact that Satoshi made a mistake in the early code and actually considered *longer* chains more valid, hashrate-based consensus for **rule changes** has literally never been in the code for 8 years. It is a new interpretation—a lie which makes no sense because Section 8 of the whitepaper exists—and all that code that directly contradicts all the people arguing about what consensus means, too.

They refuse to allow cooperative input from most external developers; some of the review they have gotten is poorly-received and returned with insults. The hostility is rampant and ingrained in the core of the constitution document itself which must be **signed** by people who want to participate in their process.
In order to become a leader of the project, you must divulge your **real and full name** while simultaneously signing a contractual agreement which states, among other things, a bunch of propagandistic lies about core.
That is, just to formally participate in that process, you must contractually agree with insults against hundreds and hundreds of other people you've never met before.
This idea of cooperation is thus made impossible.
*Satoshi himself could not formally participate in BTU's process, so their concept of "Satoshi's vision" is quite absurd.*

I have corrected the problem in  — the same thing can't happen again. I also correct the trolls by instantly kickbanning them from -wizards when they show up under their own names. The public nature of those channels means it's not possible to both accept contributions from new people who just want a short-term say (often a critically important say) and also prevent the persistant time-suck trolls from generating too much noise to make discussion useful.
However, being completely arm's length from (as far as I can tell) the entirety of core and others, and not being a full code-contributing developer, especially now, I have much less trouble acting to deal with disruptions to active communications or personal attacks.
The problem is that there exist certain people with IMO compulsion-related mental disorders who literally dedicate fulltime their entire daily schedule to *just wrecking it because people don't like talking to them*. They will employ large numbers of VPN exit points. They will literally sign up thousands of Freenode account names. By hand. Moreover, there also exist some small number of criminals who, when banned, actively doxx and build *entire infrastructure* specifically designed to libel people. There are Freenode staffers right now where, if you google their names, the only thing that comes back is childporn apologia and supremacist ranting. Fucking brutal.
Freenode does nothing to fundamentally halt this, so the IRC channels—even though IRC is through decades of fire the only potentially viable public communications mechanism—have inherent flaws which make it impossible to deal with sustained paid or disorder-fueled attacks.
A bot can't be used to deal with this. A human must. There is no real way to prevent this. Even a bot that was comprehensively moderating all incoming communications before posting them to a public channel can't match for vicious tone or violent innuendo.
The only way to currently achieve peaceful channels is to make them private or to make signups expensive. There is no other way. For now.
Slack is worse, by the way, to people reading this. People like slack because colours and site previews.

No. This is wrong. The fees for that were thrown away, but the block reward coinbase was the full possible block reward. That block explorer is incorrect. As usual. Your arithmetic is based on faulty numbers. Note that the fees plus the purported block reward of that block equal an exact 50BTC. Does that not look suspicious to you?
Note also that the coinbase transaction, the first listed transaction in that block, even according to that incorrect site, pays out a 50BTC to address 1DXuS44XTCmZBaAp399WfZyAb8ThXWsZ31. Just by that inconsistency alone, you should immediately be ignoring that terrible block explorer and using your own bitcoin node to query such data. Here's how to find out the *actual* truth instead of trusting that some programmer somewhere knows how to add better than a globally self-consistent network. In my examples, I have made the command "b" an alias of "bitcoin-cli", and my node is a full transaction indexing node:
    b getblockhash 164246
    00000000000000443f07eff02a3a5f2414aa6f672d70373994df3c329325ea6f
    b getblock 00000000000000443f07eff02a3a5f2414aa6f672d70373994df3c329325ea6f true | grep -A 1 '"tx"'
        "tx" : [ "9e36edf89e48bb2cf706d69727477e45b8c942e4efece048daf1a5c286bd4407",
    b decoderawtransaction $( b getrawtransaction 9e36edf89e48bb2cf706d69727477e45b8c942e4efece048daf1a5c286bd4407 )
*...bunch of stuff elided...*
        "vin" : [ { "coinbase" : "04f41f244f02b3012c4d4d3d3dcf0b82c53c1a79539743f619e466a79458c7f9b17f1c579643d1d766627c20810100000000000000",
        "vout" : [ { "value" : 50.00000000,
*... bunch of stuff elided ...*
                "addresses" : [ "1DXuS44XTCmZBaAp399WfZyAb8ThXWsZ31"
In other words, that block explorer is misleading you by presenting data in such a way that the *history of the blockchain is not only being misinterpreted, but is also being misrepresented.*
Given that academics such as Adi Shamir scrape these sorts of sites to write their (incorrect, and misleading) papers, I often very carefully instruct people to be accurate when they encounter strange blocks such as the one I produced or ones where miners threw away fees, because the consequences can be very severe. Obviously not enough people (*ahem, programmer of that blockchain included*) made it to the only place where actually accurate information seems to be available these days.

No miner should be completely agnostic to the contents that he mines. For example, SatoshiDice was an obvious fraud in that shortly after the sale, traffic suddenly disappeared.

In the future, consider asking other people to also snapshot and cryptographically sign and/or timestamp it. wkhtmltoimage is a high-quality rendering mechanism which can be used and signed since the results are just a single image; also, various mechanisms including the open wayback machine clone, and browser plugins can be used to build on-disk copies of a website which can be viewed another time.

You're getting a lot of venom and vitriol because people are making a lot of assumptions about you and you're posting about how Bitcoin can't be successful—which breaks their mental model of how the world works. From the inside out, most of us think it can be successful, and are pretty sure it will be.
I find the reactions to this story to be much more of a problem than the story itself. User interface and usability are completely different from the infrastructural strength, and while your issue in particular is entirely about user interface, your story says things about Bitcoin's value as a whole, and you seem to be speaking from a position of resentment which doesn't exactly make your voice particularly authoritative, in spite of your education; however, the spite here is *brutal*. *That* is what turns people off, and I'm pretty sure the people posting here know that.

This is..  basically completely false. Presumably you're not including most of the software and libraries built to support the primary client software.
There were explicit and specific historical examples of bitaddress, for example, failing utterly at being secure, to the detriment of its users. For example, its PRNG function calls part of itself arcfour (a.k.a. RC4), even though RC4-based RNG has been **known to be biased since 2001**.
Additionally, it's *utter nonsense* to claim that served-javascript is a secure form of keygen, especially when it provides such insecure ways of feeding entropy into its PRNG. Literally the server could, undetectably, serve up a reduced form of randomness and what user is going to know that?! Or even be able to detect it, even *given instructions on how to detect it*?
Neither are instructions, poorly-followed by the average human, to keygen bitcoin keys which are *meant* to have a longer lifetime than those generated by more-secure software designed to generate keys in secure fashion, a good idea at all.
Picking cards from a shuffled deck is *absurd* for Bitcoin keys. Nobody can shuffle the cards adequately from a new deck, for example, which means there's on average going to be a bias towards order in the form of suits and numbers.
Literally the first warning sign of this post should smack you right in the face when he claims that a javascript keygen which suffered from, e.g. this:
Is better tested than *all* other Bitcoin software.
Totally absurd.
Meanwhile, the brainwallet guy has been caught *explicitly* attempting to crack brainwallets. How is that ethical? Who would entrust their keygen to a website run by someone who was caught actively trying, as far as we could tell, to steal peoples' money?!

In that case, calling a fictional number a bitcoin "market cap" and then calculating it by multiplying total-bitcoins-mined not only makes no sense, but is done incorrectly even just for the sake of accuracy anyway.
Bitcoin *has no market cap.* The idea is absurd and incorrect. It has an *economy.* It has *measurable, specific market depths.* It has *estimable coins-in-circulation.* Other facets are studied by academics all the time, and provide a much more reasonable description of the bitcoin economy than a fictional number that *does not, in fact, represent the market's opinion of what the total worth or even the total buying power of all possible bitcoins* is, at all.

The market depth of all exchanges put together, in the event someone had enough bitcoins all together on all of them to do single coordinated sales on all of them in order to completely wipe them, is a tiny, tiny fraction of $10b. For example, on Bitstamp, the current market depth is, right down to *zero*: $6,084,200. If you sold 80,000 bitcoins on Bitstamp right now, you would only make $6m, and price would be basically zero. That's wiping the entire orderbook clean.
This imaginary number of $10b is a complete myth, totally divorced from reality.
(edit: Meanwhile, on Bitfinex, the total order depth down to 0.0011 is only $10,323,950.)

You neglected the part where the total number of bitcoins in circulation is not only unknown, but at a probable upper bound is *significantly less* than the total number of bitcoins that has come into existence, and virtually nobody has taken this into account, except that guy recently who showed that supply inflation has chipped away significantly at the equivalent-ATH values, and even *he* got it tragically incorrect. (He estimated *way* too low a figure of missing bitcoins.)
It is *highly* inaccurate since a blind multiplication of value in almost *all cases* ignores supply facts.
The purchase power of most bitcoins is limited if it were to be exercised in any more than the current market depths, since *nearly all merchants* who accept coins currently convert instantly to fiat. This in addition to my other points is a *clear reason* why market depth is important in determining "total value."
In the event you want to talk about gold (as per Vaultoro or GCX,) then the comparison is similarly false since there is not only more gold in circulation (and gold's price is higher) but the total major stores of it are relatively well-known, protected, and catalogued. The same applies to stocks, bonds, etc.
When I say trivial manipulatable movement, I am saying that literally anyone with any significant bitcoin holdings basically currently dictates the market price. The market is *not* memoryless, as is trivially seen by the simple patterns of, say, the pricing movements six months prior to the halving being identical both the first time around *and the currently ongoing one.*
Therefore, it is *not* the current market value of bitcoins; it is merely the price of bitcoins as per current Chinese market makers. Additionally, it *incorrectly* conveys a traditional analysis to people which in Bitcoin's case *does not apply* due to the issues I have outlined (among others,) whereas in a traditional stock market the only thing preventing the sale of stocks or bonds is their current registered owners' unwillingness to do so, but in any event, much like real-world market cap post-valuation markers in funding rounds, bitcoin's price is currently highly dependant *on top of the above* on the unwillingness of current owners to circulate their holdings.
More interesting would be a regular graph of real market depth, combined with a (price x known-circulating) number. It would certainly be much less misleading a figure. Bitcoin does not represent the sort of economy that the repetition of market-cap figures implies.

Why hello, Mr. Disingenuous.
You know "3000 listening nodes" is not a full node *count*, right? You are quoting data which does not agree with your premise.
Since you don't seem to know the difference and are in any case conflating them, a *listening node* is a node which is capable of *accepting a connection*. This is not an correlate of *actual validating nodes on the network*. Those data points are therefore invalid. The *security and usefulness of the network is strongly dependant on the number of full, validating nodes.*
Since you are mixing "listening nodes" with "total nodes" so much, there is no actual derived trends we can observe from your (crappy) data. UPNP was shut off, and other code changes were made, which partly account for the decrease in *listening nodes.* Mass-connecting nodes such as blockchain.info were largely blocked by people who recognised that the damage mass-connections does should be mitigated.
Pretty easy to dismiss observations as "anecdotal" if they aren't written down, isn't it? "Observation by someone" is "anecdotal" now? I have full logs to prove my observations. I was in the midst of building a simple graph to prove my point when I read this note and realized you are simply being .. disingenuous. So why bother? Nothing will in fact convince you, even if I do operate within the limited confines of your acceptable evidence frame.
Nice selective quoting too. Did you learn your rhetoric from an expert? I'll guess not. My *real quote* was:
"Most of them are described as scamcoins, most of them are in fact scamcoins, most of them are written by people who are incompetent to be writing bitcoin-like currency applications, and nearly all of them rely singularly on Bitcoin's core devs to filter down expertise, exploit protections, features, and especially ideas." These are a logical OR. In the real world, disproving a single one does not disprove the whole sentence. So, focussing on a single clause and attacking it is completely meaningless. Unless you're agreeing with the rest of it? No, don't answer, I don't care.
Meanwhile, since you are being disingenuous by misquoting my comments, I can only guess you are presuming I am answering you without actually recalling *what I wrote to you in literally the parent of the note in which you're doing the misquoting.*
Since you are being disingenuous, this note will represent the most significant effort I will waste on you.
And, oh look! Another, actual continuous graph, unattributed, badly interpreted, of node count which shows *two years*, and has a downward trend, while *blockchain growth continues in all chains, and the "network effect" you credit with "growth" is muddied by the fact that you can literally check any of the -classic logs and node count graphs and see that the *growth in nodes is probably attributable to them sybil'ing the network with cheap nodes from the same origin data centres and VPSes.* And similar bumps..  why, look at that. Huge dip right in the middle. &lt;_&lt;
Overall, then, small bumps in node count, due to -XT and -classic sybil'ing especially, are *completely meaningless*. The *only* thing we know for sure is that there were lots of nodes, and now there aren't, even though Bitcoin is *more popular now than ever.*
And here we are, back at precisely what I was saying to begin with. I'll quote, because maybe there'll be less chance you'll be a jerk about it if I keep the words present:
"The higher price does not increase node count. It hasn't in the past. The overall trend has always been downward. Considering we are literally a few orders of magnitude fewer nodes than were running in the beginning, a small uptick now is completely irrelevant."
Since you keep missing this point, I'll reinterpret for you: "Price is not an independent variable."

Since I am not willing to build a permanent merklizing cryptographic timestamping mechanism to efficiently provide what people *want*, I currently run nodes which drop and blacklist spam transactions or transactions that create dust completely out of their mempools. I refuse to help people who are creating spam; and I try to educate people who create proof-of-existence type nonsense so they build something less destructive.
The ideal would be to create a network of participating nodes that package up and give proof-paths of the data hashed and store *just their own root hash* at semi-regular intervals (modulo need,) into an OP_RETURN or a dummy multisig.
You can check his prototype code here:
Or, we can simply use one of the stronger merged-mining altcoins like namecoin, where storing data like cryptographic stamps *is part of its design purpose.* Such data is welcome there.
Or, Chronobit can be used in P2Pool's sharechain, which gives less granularity but is similarly zero-impact to Bitcoin's blockchain.
@_date: 2016-06-02 04:19:42


No. It is only dropped from the mempool if higher-priority tx push them out of the currently-configured mempool limits *and* enough transactions are mined that there comes to be enough room at the tail end of the mempool that it would be accepted again, *and* it is rebroadcasted through a linkage of nodes who have all done the same thing, *and* nobody in that chain keeps a blacklist of dropped transactions.
Also, infinities have different sizes. But heat-death of the universe means there is no infinity to costs. Why are you claiming bandwidth cost is what you're discussing? It *is* a useful way to look at it because bandwidth is not the only cost, now is it?

Yes, correct. None of the proof-of-existence mechanisms do it efficiently nor *with basically any concern whatsoever* for other people having to store crap forever.
Peter Todd had the idea of a network of linked merklizing proof storage nodes; instead things like proof-of-existence (whose author had zero concept of why it was wrong to needlessly bloat, by the way) just dump raw hashes of crap in there *for no good reason.*
And you're wrong. There's plenty that miners can do to filter spam transactions. This particular one was coinbase input and therefore not reasonably filterable. But the proof-of-existence and OP_RETURN spam is fairly trivially filterable.
The people doing it need to realize that they're causing a *net decrease* in the value of Bitcoin, because this kind of spam makes people less likely to run full nodes. "I'm not running random storage for idiots."

All users who can should run a full, validating, archival node. It is a mistake to recommend users *not* run a full archival node who can and has been ever since people started doing it.

"To ask, inquire, make inquiry"
The collision was provided basically on-the-spot. This means it can be done by anyone else, especially given the instructions for doing so were right there alongside the collision.
The publishing of the code is being demanded by people for two reasons:
1) In the future, people will claim gmax is being uncooperative by not filing PR, and destructive by publishing an attack tool that requires zero expertise to integrate by script kiddies.
2) People without the ability to write it themselves are demanding it because code they don't understand has a mystical quality of proof which an actual collision-on-the-spot, they have been convinced, doesn't.
What good would code do? "Here's how to find a collision between a short-length of SHA2 hashes."

Shallow market depth in this case is a (loose) indicator of *less* market value since a shallow market indicates trivial movements result in volatility especially when you combine this with historical market movements which resulted in longer-term re-evaluations of market pricing, either up or down.
The *value* of our Bitcoins on a per-Bitcoin basis is barely indicated by current orderbook price matching.
Meanwhile it is completely meaningless to *valuate* Bitcoin at $10b via a straight multiplication both because of shallow market depth which has proven to be trivially manipulable due to the fact that the total possible Bitcoins in circulation can't actually be counted by the nature of the system, *and* because the estimates we do have show that a significant fraction of the bitcoins that "exist" in fact are permanently out of circulation.
Bitcoin sometimes escapes normal traditional market analyses because when you examine the *rationale for calculating value* you often discover the *rationale* simply doesn't apply as a result of Bitcoin's nature or its limited markets.

That is posted on a site which explicitly blocks Tor and VPN exit points, in spite of the person who started it claiming it would not and did not, and is thus an anti-privacy visit which requires archive-proxies or more obscure VPN literally just to read.
Since the owner himself seems oblivious to this policy, it seems likely to me that it is simply not safe to visit sites like this. Perhaps it would be better to put it in an actual repository somewhere both to ensure that changes are correctly versioned, and also to allow mirroring in the event whoever is in charge of traffic policy doesn't sweep the rug out from under the guy who said he's in charge of the site itself.

The amount of information which can be propagated and *must* be propagated in order for a node to validate a block event would increase; therefore, the blocksize is increased with segwit.
You are being disingenuous and playing semantic games by pretending to define "blocksize" as something which excludes the witness data—however, the witness data is part of the block, and therefore yes, blocksize is indeed increasing with the use of segwit.
Your second attempt to slip in "witness data is not part of a block" was ignored by gmax, but you are just as incorrect when you state this a second time, since witness data is required as part of consensus. Segwit is a superset of functionality, and you are wrong by pretending to canonically define the term "block" in opposition to functional reality.

I'm saying *the calculations that apply to Bitcoin have additional variables that are not used in standard calculations such as blind market cap.* We all know how much outstanding stock in AAPL there is. We don't know how much outstanding bitcoin there is. We can guess. But almost nobody ever does.
We can measure the purchasing power of USD. But Bitcoin's purchasing power, as a result of companies like BitPay that stunt growth, is only really calculable at the moment via indirect USD/fiat purchasing power. What, for example, is the market cap of USD itself? It doesn't really have one, since USD isn't a stock. The "market cap" of USD is some other measure; it has another name, and it's usually a measure of the global economy denominated in USD, modulo weird things the USG is doing to the supply. (But seriously? You think USD has a market cap? What is it?)
Well, Bitcoin isn't a stock either, and since if you pretend that the Bitcoin market cap (similar to that of a tradeable asset) is a rough idea of how much traders believe the aggregate total is, we would have to discover *how much bitcoin those traders believe is circulating or could circulate.* Since the total is a variable estimate, the blind (price x total bitcoins) value has *no meaning.* A measure of the size of the captured economy would be better; a measure of the liquidity of the markets would be better. A measure of Bitcoin's *other features* is a superior and more realistic measure. It seems the only reason anyone ever talks about Bitcoin's market cap is because they can fake a number in the billions.
Are you even capable of grasping the fact that the nature of bitcoin requires a few additional variables? I'm not saying the attempt to value the economy as a whole is useless. Only an idiot would think I'm saying that when I provided another measure entirely to describe it. I'm saying the blind multiplication of the two values has no meaning.

Tell me again how using ones own words as proof of a radical shift in philosophy and viewpoint is at all "assassination"? Do you even know what the term "character assassination" means!?
People agreed with Jeff Garzik in the past for a reason. Proof of a radical break in philosophical outlook resulting in the participation in an attack on Bitcoin is a reasonable thing to point out, and is a reasonable contrast to make to demonstrate that there *has been a radical shift.* Sure, people are perfectly entitled to change their minds, viewpoints, philosophy, aims, and goals from one year literally just to the next.
Sure they are.
That doesn't mean that a clear pointing out of this fact is anything but a reminder to people that their original agreement with the man should not be the reason why they support any of his current activities.
A shift this radical, on the other hand, tells people other things too—such as how his current efforts may be driven by non-ideological realities that we may not be privvy to, which would in some conditions help invalidate his current destructive positions. (Need of money for example.)
There's also nothing wrong with elevating awareness of this radical shift as a way to show people that support for his current efforts is similarly invalid—consider: would *literally any other developers* who weren't there early on have the reputational clout to further a project this internally destructive *all by themselves*? He *obviously* is trading on a reputation he developed in part by posting these comments in a public forum. He *obviously* is trading on past activities and signalling which agreed with the predominant philosophies of early Bitcoin adopters.
He *obviously* is now vigourously breaking with that past signalling.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with a post detailing a stark contrast, especially if his *current philosophical outlook* requires zero cites to demonstrate such a contrast!
**Character assassination** is what user ydtm does with his long, moronic rambling diatribes and shrill squealing.
This is a completely diatribe-free set of pointers to actual comments.
This post is basically completely assassination-free. *Even were* there some kind of assassination going on, it's Garzik's own posts which are doing it, not anything jonny1000 is saying!
So give the "propaganda is bad, this is propaganda, therefore this is bad" bullshit non-sequitur a break.

There are valuations of such which are well-known and well-used; there are well-known stores of USD; there are known FOREX markets in which value comparisons are discovered; money supplies are tightly regulated and carefully controlled. Most of what you're saying is actually incorrect, but in any event inflationary money supply means only that money is continually injected into circulation. Google "money supply" and try to think about why your great-grandfather could buy a jar of milk for two bits.
So, you can't sell all USD. It's the base currency for USians. "Selling" USD means you just bought all the things it can buy, modulo your personal ability to realize its full value by bargaining.

1. It's not completely unknown. It is known to be within reasonable bounds. It can be estimated. It has been estimated. It has been estimated to a fairly narrow set of bounds. Known-lost bitcoins have been estimated by a number of people. Coins that are unspendable *do not factor into the purchasing power of bitcoins because current value is in part calculated by traders who reasonably think they're never coming back.* If I know it, people in the market know it, too.
2. Market cap's definition, as far as I can tell, doesn't really apply to non-stock, non-corporate-type assets like bitcoin. The IRS can pretend that Bitcoins are like an asset for the purposes of taxation, but the reality is they aren't. That's just the IRS trying to make things simpler for people. What's the market cap for pogs? Beanie babies? Antique chairs? It doesn't apply. What's the market cap of wood products? Of diamond rings? What's the market cap of the precious metal, "gold"? The market depth is *extremely relevant* for the BitPay reason I mentioned.
3. The two similar incidents are not the only ones. It is not memoryless and therefore it is not a Markov process: hashrate appears to have a direct input into it, for example. Specific, measurable events have a permanent effect on Bitcoin's price. The *current price is virtually meaningless on its future price* which can be seen by its continued volatility. It is incorrect to attempt to apply a pure Markov process to Bitcoin, even assuming the method is valid in the first place.

Very few; usually complaints about his programming ability focus on style and readability from commercial developers. For example, Hearn once complained that an uncommented heap traversal (which used a bit shift) caused him issues when he was trying to reimplement bitcoin in Java.
Nobody's knowledge is comprehensive—I suspect that if any single one of any of the contributing developers started from where Satoshi did, virtually none of them would have ended up with something which could withstand six years of study by thousands of people and cryptographers around the world scrutinizing every detail. There are always cleverer ways of doing something. There are always more efficient ways of doing things. There isn't enough time in the day.
I found Satoshi's versions very readable, and enjoyable to modify. My disagreement was simply with how much Satoshi locked under the hood—for example, it would remember prior proxy settings and try them, or it would solicitously attempt to punch holes in uPnP firewalls. Given the extensive analysis of the blockchain in the early days, I've always thought Satoshi made two versions of Bitcoin: one for us, and one he kept to himself which was tooled to help him analyze the network.

We don't, actually, know that. What we know is the current limit is very close to what the maximum possible limit is with current hardware and current software, without making extreme changes such as shutting off tx verification of it is older than e.g. 24 hours as reported by the block it's contained within.
Additionally, your comments about segwit are incorrect, since the signalling for other BIP was slower for BIP which were successfully activated.
Meanwhile, I find it very telling that the people involved in the multiple prior hardfork projects are suddenly best buds with the Chinese miners they previously strenuously attacked as enemies. (Hearn's position that the Chinese were enemies, for example, was some pretty horrible stuff.) —best buds enough that they are trying to entice them with the power to change previously hard network parameters.

Point  in his writeup is incorrect. It is speculation which ignores the facts of history. We at one point had tens of thousands of nodes. By some estimates, that number may have been in the hundreds of thousands. We are now multiple orders of magnitude fewer, after growing to multiple orders of magnitude greater user population.
It is *false* to conclude that adding more users via larger blocks would increase full node count.
I can state from personal experience moderating the primary IRC channels on Freenode, that *virtually all* of the problems with initializing new nodes for *nearly all* the users who come in to the channels there asking for help, have to do with how large the blockchain is.

It's worthless as a value proposition alternate to Bitcoin. The entire *point* of Bitcoin is completely lost on the BCH people.
Even if they rationalize it to themselves that they, for example, just "lost the propaganda war," they won't risk losing absolutely everything. You see a hint of that when Roger hedges his position in the recent interview with that cheerful Japanese woman, contrary to his pumping in r\btc.

Okay, but doing what? As an example, 20 years of doing PHP programming is different from systems and device driver programming is different from microcontroller firmware programming is (crucially) different from security, reverse engineering, and cryptography experience.
Gavin's MO was typically to delegate to someone else those things which he felt he was not completely competent to accomplish on his own, or where it wasn't completely clear which direction he should choose to push towards. In other words, his expertise was not comprehensive and he demonstrated some times (but not always) that he was aware of his own limitations.

It has already been measured—luke-jr did an anti-sybil'able poll which demonstrated essentially concusively that actual user consensus was overwhelmingly in support of segwit, and against an immediate block size increase; additionally, the fact that massive amounts of BCH is being actively dumped (with..  *vast* amounts more coming,) is a clear economic vote *against* forks written by, e.g. copyright thieves and single-miner cabal blockchains.

He did leave core a long time ago. He was still referring to his position on the team page and calling himself a core developer as a means to leverage his position w.r.t his work and business activity. He was left on the page because of inertia and because until he started coding actual attacks, all he was doing was being noisy and obnoxious on Twitter and IRC.

I find it pretty telling that Circle et al (the people whose company depended until now on Bitcoin) have not only refused to participate in the development process with useful development and contributions, but have openly derided, mocked, and blamed the actual *literally hundreds* of people working on the platform on which their corporation critically depended.
This form of short-sightedness is endemic to a small subclass of corporations (like Circle) who have taken a self-destructive antagonistic stance towards a huge group of people they've collected into a homogeneous "uncooperative" bucket.
This is just demonstrative of a lack of planning, a lack of simple outreach, and an internal cognitive brokenness when they accept the false narratives they've been sold. It's also the height of arrogance that they feel they've contributed so much they can dictate and derogate the direction the original project settled on—and the character of literally hundreds of people, even though the reality is these companies fail in the midst of their own separate bubbles of reality that **they themselves created and embraced** and the group of people who otherwise manage to cooperate together have no issue opposing the terrible "governance" models these companies attempted to impose.
Under what investment model can people expect to make demands of an open source project they themselves utterly and completely refused to participate in? What hubris. What egotism. What entitlement!

He didn't claim it was a "Github" commit message. He claimed it was a *commit message*. And there are plenty of them. It's literally in the entire history of the commits of the *Git repository*.
commitid e2a30bc9a9f7d2969e52632f8e8942a4e72f4ba6 has exactly the same information in it. And Gavin made those commits himself, and used his email address himself. And posts it to every message he posts to the development mailing list. And uses his real name on Reddit.
And people who *do* in fact issue multiple criminal physical threats against him are still unbanned. \u\pagex for example.
(edit): And it turns out that the parent posting of this message is false. His guess about the dox'ing of the second individual is wrong. It turns out that posting the literal commit of a public history including the email address of a person that the person himself submits to commit histories, to mailing lists, and that **he himself posts to his own main blog page** is enough to get a Reddit ban.
Absurd. Go check his website:
It's literally right there at the bottom of his own blog in the "say hello" button!
(edit x 2): That is irrelevant, dude. The Github repository just converts the author to a link to Gavin's main Github page **which itself lists his email address.** And he put it directly on his own homepage! And he uses his real name..! Dude you don't know wtf you're talking about.

"Normally, in Bitcoin Unlimited when we find a Core bug we just fix it and move on." (subtext: completely without reporting it--thanks guys.)
"This post should destroy[...]"
"Indeed, Bitcoin Unlimited is building the highest quality, most stable, Bitcoin client available." (minus the lack of interest in interoperability, the mud-slinging, the willingness to fork other alt-clients off the network, and handing critical network parameters over to people who only mine)
"As we mine the garbage"
"and are liable to make mistakes outside their expertise."
"I want you to realise that these issues are systemic to Core"
"we have found these bugs over the past year in various Core releases." (subtext: without reporting any of them)
"Let’s Lose Some Money"
"And look, the developer added a comment" (subtext: it was there as of commit id e071a3f, which means it was Satoshi. Apparently "Satoshi's vision" is good enough but his code wasn't.)
"Would I have accepted a “// this must not fail” comment in a pull request for a function that can return “failed”?" (It didn't show up in a pullreq. It was there in Aug 2009.)
"not a good response from a strong development team, by the way"
"fixing garbage with garbage"
"We first saw this problem as core dumps on the Mac platform." (subtext: without reporting anything)
"a worldwide 10 billion dollar financial network?" (subtext: there is no such thing as a Bitcoin market cap—the term is inapplicable to Bitcoin)
"one must wonder"
"However, I was unable to “weaponize” this exploit during my testing so I feel that there is little risk in public disclosure today." (subtext: Nobody is a better programmer than "I" am, so I'll assume it's impossible.)
"I hope that you will realise that, contrary to statements from Adam Back and others, the Core team does not have unique skills and abilities that qualify them to administer this network." (subtext: The hundreds of people involved in core are worse than I am.)
That is not reluctance. That is gleeful abandon and either an attempt to drop a 0-day or a powerfully large personal ego problem. This is important—either you felt that you are more capable of exploiting a bug than anyone, or you were aware someone else might be able to exploit the bug and therefore you just dropped a 0-day DDoS-able bug without reporting it "responsibly." (Your word.)
Meanwhile, you insulted a loose group of hundreds of people about a dozen times or more, and then claim that it is actually core themselves who are acting badly. At best, you're feeding exactly the same sort of behaviour you have a problem with right back at them.

"Deniers" include people who know that a coin with a single incompetent developer who is a copyright thief, which is also mined by a single majority mining cabal is ultimately worthless.
@_date: 2017-08-01 00:12:51
All of this is correct. The only difference is that in the case of BCH, the scam is well known for its scammy properties, it is well-penetrated into the news sphere that its author is a copyright thief (for example,) and it is well-known that there is going to be basically a single entity mining it. It is well-known what this would have meant if it were true for Bitcoin.
What you are saying is correct for e.g. Ethereum. You are absolutely correct in terms of reasoning about things like Dash and Ethereum.
We could additionally say that since Bitcoin has special stature as a non-scam, it is more important to ensure that money flows in the direction of XBT holders instead of BCH holders, and therefore the ethics of driving the utility of BCH down outweigh the ethics of considering the potential victim bagholders.

No, this is false.

On top of that, they don't need to send any data. All they have to do is change how your system generates secure key material, and they can break your connection and read your private data anyway.

Not only that, but the buying power of fiat itself isn't fixed—what is the buying power of $1 now vs. 100 years ago? And not only *that* but the economies of scale have made some things cheaper and some things more expensive—so even if there was a way to bypass all that, actual buying power is not static, can't really be measured, and isn't a straight exchange of any known unit to goods or services thanks to market efficiencies changing over time.

A shill pretends to be an enthusiastic customer or swindler or gambler. The implications of the term imply deceit and most often remuneration. Since nobody was being paid from October onwards, there was hardly a reward to correct the Buttcoiner lies. Instead, I get libel and abuse heaped on me by someone who doesn't seem to understand English.


Fine, so up until the eth hack, the cheque itself wasn't enough to dissuade you from using the platform. Together, all problems made you stop using the platform. Good for you.
The **frozen** (not seized—seizure requires appropriation) funds that CIBC froze were immediately returned to the person whose account they were frozen from when the court case was ended.
And yeah, I agree all that together was enough to exit the exchange. That doesn't mean randos posting lies were right to do that. Dude, barsoapguy was **explicitly feeding** on peoples' angst and attempting to sow further distrust and hate. Like it's right there in his comment history. There were death threats. You're telling me these people deserved some kind of open mind?! Of course you're not, because that would be stupid.


No. **WRONG**. We are literally only having this conversation because you are stating libellous and defamatory comments about me and my reputation matters to me as a fellow Canadian citizen. If you hadn't said that none of this thread would exist. I don't give a crap about warnings (but I agree they were warning signs.) I don't give a crap about any of that. Literally all I was doing was correcting your use of English and legal terms such as solvency, which by the factual record available to us were wrong. It turns out your conclusion was correct—I'm happy to admit that. Well, not happy, since the XBT exchange situation in Canada totally sucks right now, but I'm more than willing to agree with people about factual correctness.


I will say that between the two of us, and given my extensively edited post history which I went through to ensure that a misunderstanding like this never happens again, one of us is being materially damaging and it's not me.
Retract your libellous comments about shilling and provable harm, fellow Canadian citizen. I am more than willing to state my outlook was optimistic, and yours was not. My outlook turned out to be incorrect.
I based my outlook on the fact that Cotten had materially misrepresented the actual security and safety of user funds at Quadriga, and did it in a very convincing way, the fact that during the ether loss they sustained **significant** withdrawal pressure with instantaneous crypto withdrawals, the fact that Jennifer appeared to be attempting to correct the directorship problems of the company rather than abandon it, and the fact that virtually every single report here on Reddit about a slowed withdrawal or lack of withdrawal or other problems that *I read here* were expertly addressed by a QCX employee with a ready explanation that rarely varied from reported actual outcome. Also, the fact that they are Canadian meant that they were easily reached by **local** lawyers with the use of laws I am familiar with. MtGox, BTC-e, the rest of the exit scams, the MyBitcoin wallet scam—none of them shared substantial details with the QCX problems we were having.
I was there for MtGox, I was an active trader there. The signals there were six months in advance multi-month wire and withdrawal problems, multiple hacks, multiple coin losses, Karpeles' comment and blog history, and everyone including myself who depended on my opinion left and never lost anything more than account rounding errors.
As far as I know, there had been no hacks of QCX; no actual known prior loss of funds, and a well-oiled PR apparatus which was calmly explaining court cases and an older admission of an ether failure. A security history like that is surprising, especially based on the fact that we now know for example that they were using **freekin' cloud backups**. Like wtf.

You clearly don't know what constitutes harassment, either.
I have had no issues. Slower than usual—but always successful—withdrawals, deposits, and a higher premium which was consistent with their operations almost from the beginning.
I never said anything about an exit; I never said anything about whether they were trustworthy. My entire comment history is filled with comments correcting both misinformation, and people who were concluding something which wasn't supported by evidence.
I was a significant trader in MtGox. I lost nothing in MtGox. Nobody who knew me and relied on my opinion lost even a penny on MtGox except rounding errors.
Asserting something that is contrary to factual reality, which could lead to further harassment, is in fact harassment. You are currently doing the harassment, because you appear to be looking for someone to blame, and you are lashing out at everyone (not just me, based on your shitty harassment-filled comment history) to satisfy whatever harm you think you've suffered.
Lying about doing harm when literally my entire related comment history is an attempt to clarify the evidence which we had, correct outright lies from Buttcoiners, and further to correct my posts with edit markers when new evidence arrived which showed QCX had been lying to us, is not harming people.
It is encouraging an objective view of reality.
So tell me again, since you were apparently out since January 2018—tell me again how you know more than someone who actually used the platform for the entire year and is clearly better-informed than you are?
Are you an insider who is currently attempting to splash some blame around? Why are you consistently refusing to answer whether you are an insider with special knowledge, anonymous Reddit troll? How else can you have known better than someone who actually successfully used the platform for the entire year you said it was clearly a scam?
Are you an ex-employee with special knowledge of what was going on? Why didn't you whistleblow earlier?

And, if you'd read my comments, I corrected them with edit markers now that we have slightly more reliable evidence as to the disposition of the drafts. Until we had comments from Billerfy themselves, all we had to go by was the word of the people who had been, up until about October of last year, eventually delivering (as far as I'm aware) every XBT and fiat withdrawal requested.
You are who, now? You interpreted things negatively from the beginning, based on badly-interpreted evidence. Unless you had special knowledge of the inner workings of QCX, you were less informed than any of us who were actually using the exchange were.
Are you saying you had special knowledge of the inner workings of QCX which would have made your word more authoritative than the average informed QCX user?

:-/ There's no such thing as a market cap; and certainly multiplying an estimated supply by the current price tells us virtually nothing at all useful about the economy behind it.
Also, re:


No; the price is reflexive to small movements of coins and small spikes in demand. It doesn't take much to spike price significantly—the current price is quite divorced from most arbitrary measures of value (such as market cap) and can be elevated or depressed well outside of proportion to the costs and money required to do so. The wealth of the OG'ers you're describing in the event of a huge price spike would be nowhere near small countries' actual economic strengths, and we are as a whole **nowhere near** any significant real-world economy. We can say that a trade of n XBT equals the value of those XBT, but that has nothing to do with the market cap and thus reasoning about price in this fashion will also result in false conclusions.
We knew this the last price spike, as any OG'er who was willing to dump *could never have extracted anywhere near the value of their coins' market-cap equivalent* regardless of whether they used dark pool sells or OTC or whatever. The demand simply wasn't there.
I don't see there being any issue at all with what we might consider an absurd price now except as price nears or drops below mining costs. There is no such constraint on the top end, since people who own it could simply decide collectively they won't trade for anything less than $30k or higher per-coin. (After all, the decimal location is a psychological construct that has nothing to do with reality whatsoever.)

Thank you for posting some technical sanity. :-)
There was a minor bank run after the eth loss—I know of no people, for example, who didn't withdraw absolutely everything as quickly as possible, and sat with zero balances for months waiting for an implosion to happen. When it didn't, some people began putting smaller amounts in, test-withdrawing them, then selling them and withdrawing fiat. For most of this time and even for larger withdrawal amounts, aside from the premium spiking as people attempted to withdraw BTC to rescue their fiat, the site continued to function and delays were as they'd always been.
On top of that, they \*claimed\* that they could easily withstand the loss and would cover all deposits themselves. The fact they appeared to be able to actually withstand the mini-run was surprising evidence of that. We thought they were goners at that time.

Eh, whatever. I'm okay with accepting your explanation, and I'm not interested in digging through your weird endless post history.
I'm not investigating anything. I'm just asking questions—if you are so sure of yourself, apparently after having a single encounter with one of the cofounders that left a sour taste on your mouth, and you're not an insider, then the best you could have known was as much as I knew—which was only what QCX told us, and only what could be gleaned from the actually reliable posts of people complaining about withdrawal delays (and in particular, when they were happening.)
You haven't pointed to a single post where I'm encouraging people to stay with QCX during the issues they were having, or sign up with QCX, or to deposit money with QCX, or to refrain from withdrawing anything from QCX.
All you seem to be doing is pretending you are some kind of weird OG and are thus somehow.. what? Better equipped to evaluate the state of exchanges in Canada when you clearly haven't been using QCX for years? When you didn't participate in the mini-run when they lost the ether to test their ability to handle larger volumes of withdraws? Or get reliably paid for years and years while they \*appeared\* to be solvent? (Until they obviously weren't?) What? Based on the fact that they mishandled one of your \*cheques\*?!
You never explained your "dealings" with Michael before. Again, calm your hyper self: I'm not doing any investigation. I literally was looking at your comments from less than a week ago, which were under like three pages.
Tell you what—I'll take you at your word that you're not an insider, and I'll expect you to give me the courtesy of not calling me a "shill" or trying to put some kind of weird blame on me just because I've insulted your intelligence by name-calling you.
I think perhaps you should take your comments in your post history a little more seriously—
\&gt; You know what they say about assumptions.
\&gt; If you won't take my literal words as my position in favor of your imagination there is no discussion at all.
That pretty much sums it up.
You called me a shill: a shill gets paid for promoting something. I have never been paid. And I certainly haven't been promoting QCX while they stopped paying out.
You called me a dangerous liar even though I never asserted they were solvent (I only defined the term for people who kept using it incorrectly, like you—\*\*and\*\* I corrected my posts to state they were insolvent based on the legal filings because clearly people like yourself were misinterpreting me.) Between the two of us, tell me again who's being the more reasonable?
You said I was provably doing harm, but have pointed to no specifics whatsoever and just seem to be on your own little witch hunt.
So, back yourself up a little. I've been here since late 2010; chill out. I've already stated that I updated my opinion. Multiple times. I edited my posts (with edit markers) to help future posterity. I've \*never\* asserted that people should keep their money in QCX. It's always been a risk. I've never encouraged anything like what you're describing, and it's super not cool that you're pointing a finger in my direction for correcting the \*\*meaning of the fucking word solvent.\*\*
My opinion was, "Not enough information." Now it is, "Plenty of information." Get it?

I can't believe you are continuing to spread libellous comments which are untruthful, and using words like shill and lying, which imply deceit—a deceit conspicuously absent from even your own inconsistent accusations.


No; not every. If you had used terminology which correctly identified the illiquid status of QCX, I would have vociferously agreed with you. Lauded you even. I thanked other people for less. Instead you asserted (now, clearly obvious that it was without real evidence,) that they were insolvent—which means that their assets were less than their liabilities. We now know that is true, but aside from a shareholder mishandling your cheque, and the weird ether send destruction of funds, you couldn't possibly have known that about e.g. their XBT stores. Right?


What? The ether contract failure was provably destroyed funds. They aren't going anywhere unless the ETH foundation agrees to hardfork a return of said funds to QCX (the way they bailed themselves out of the DAO.)
You're calling that a "hack"? What the heck are you even talking about?! What evidence do you have that we don't? Why would a "hacker" destroy the money instead of stealing it? As far as is known, it was a stupid mistake on QCX's part..? Is this not the case? What are you alleging actually happened there?
"Smart contract lawyering"? Wat? Ah, I see. You think that when I'm talking about "no known prior loss of funds" I'm somehow pretending that the exact ETH funds destruction that I literally mentioned two paragraphs prior wasn't a loss of funds? That's super weird.


Not moral high ground. My optimism turned out to be incorrect. Your pessimism turned out to be correct, but the logic you used to arrive at it was false. Your mistake now is asserting that you were right all along, and specifically that I was doing damage to people by basing my opinion on what were actual facts as best as we knew them.
The DAO had nothing to do with the eth destruction failure for QCX.
I'm fully aware nobody is reading this deep. Or almost nobody.
This means that yes, I believe your opinion has value. Otherwise why am I here arguing with someone who is calling himself a moron?
Retract your libellous comments, and admit that what I was doing wasn't shilling, wasn't lying and wasn't deceitful.

No, that's wrong; I asked you, because you were making conclusions which seemed unsupported by the evidence—but would be supported if you had had insider knowledge of some sort. You corrected me, and as far as I'm concerned the explanation for why you were making such assertions is quite a bit clearer—I've updated my opinion, and have discarded that possibility now as unlikely. You are consistent, at least, and thus I'm relieved to agree with you that it seems you are probably not an insider. \o Thanks for helping me update my opinion.
What you viewed as evidence (the throwing around of your cheque, for example) was information that was not generally available to the public, but in any event was meaningless on which to base an opinion, since Patryn was long gone as an actual actor in the company, right? The other evidence was evidence that I and a great many others tested extensively. That Quadriga had enough reserves to handle the mass-exodus of funds for so long afterwards was the result of that test—and its own evidence.

You can excise a single thing and pretend that, on its own, it is a meaningless so-what hum-drum. You can't excise that one thing and pretend that since it, considered on its own, is meaningless, therefore everything taken as a whole is meaningless.

If you bank bothers you about it, switch banks. It's none of their business where the money came from. Report it on your taxes as earnings. DO NOT attempt to avoid any taxes. DO NOT attempt to use tricks or hide your income from the sale event.
DO NOT use vault, storage, or other forms of third-party bitcoin storage services. Do NOT trust any of them.
If you are interested in exiting, by all means do so. These people trying to get you to save your bitcoins aren't doing you any favours.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with doing larger transfers of cash. Attempting to structure your banking activity specifically to avoid suspicious activity reports is *highly illegal.* So all these people telling you to slow down and do it in chunks are morons. *Do not* listen to them, since you've already stated your intention is to sell the whole lot of it at once.
Finally, ignore *all* advice that comes from r/bitcoin. A significant fraction of the people in here are explicitly paid shills that vote each other up to build comment history and sway opinion. (See the Coinfire revelations.) The sorts of people who are willing to lie to people in that way have absolutely no problem, and would probably think it was funny (or that you deserved it) if you went to jail for structuring.
Talk to your bank first if you are concerned, and warn them you're about to do this. Ask them for advice. It is a service you are paying for, after all.

The sum of *your* series is 100. Your series is not the series that exists in bitcoin.
So, no, I'm trying to be accurate. To say I am being pedantic is to imply that I am being needlessly or pointlessly exact. The series of bitcoin block rewards over time is not a series defined by actual division; it is defined as integral machine arithmetic division of an implementation-specific form. The definition is specific to the code and the platforms on which the code runs, and part of it is defined by precision. Secondly, it has a clear beginning and a clear end, so the formula for the sum of an infinite geometric series *doesn't actually apply.* Even if it did, bitcoin will not exist for the infinity it would take to eventually complete the sum anyway.
People—especially people to whom these sorts of rounding errors matter—often get the wrong idea when people insist that the total bitcoins that will be disbursed will eventually total to 21 million, and this is not the case, and the number of times I've had to correct these sorts of misconceptions I can no longer count.
There will be no future software without a system-wide hardfork and some kind of different money representation, which will ever correct this, either.

So far the best micro-measure of it IMO is the market depth estimate website. That seems to be a fair proportional measure of relative economic strengths of the various altcoins and Bitcoin. Beyond that, watching on-chain transactions and seeing how much money is actually being used (and not just shuffled, if it's even possible to measure such things) would be additive.
The exchanges that have fees (for everyone) also have volumes which I think are descriptive. I mean.. assuming exchanges aren't just out there totally fabricating lies of course.
If there were a way to disambiguate the arbitragers (by watching which market moves the price via first action) so we could watch what actual dumps or buys do to perturb the price that would give us I think some idea of the strength of the independence of Bitcoin's economy.
M3 supply IMO can't really be compared with even the pure Bitcoin released money supply. M3 doesn't have a price-like component except perhaps one of those inflation measures designed to identify how much of a basket $x can buy compared to what it could buy in the past. But in our case, the amount of equivalent stuff in Bitcoin would be radically perturbed (in a downward sense) the more someone tried to involve larger and larger amounts of Bitcoin. That amount of perturbation, it seems to me, would be an excellent measurement.
But someone fiddling around with a few billions dollars here and there doesn't change the *buying power* of the USD. So.. eh. Even there.
BTW, I hope I didn't come across as lecturing you or presuming ignorance—it's clear you're being thoughtful about it. But e.g. Trace Meyer when he uses market cap as some kind of commodity-equivalent economic measure..  I mean we're nowhere near e.g. the actual gold industry in terms of an economy.
The top mining *industries* w.r.t gold-the-metal contribute something like $170b to the world economy as a whole in a year. Our current total buying orderbooks worldwide are barely $250m. Golds trading volumes are in the trillions per day. There's no real other way to measure it without doing what everyone else does—sampling the related economies and doing some arithmetic.
Hrm. This got a bit longer than I wanted.

Look at historical hashrate. Any major event will change hashrate, and increase it. Technology will change. Solar energy will be the go-to source for power. Maybe an army of little solar arrays in space will eventually become the obvious alternative?
The point is, our technology today will be considered primitive by distant future standards. It is absurd to think hashrate won't rise in a hundred years. If it doesn't, then Bitcoin will have suffered an ELE, because the cost of an attack will decrease in proportion to the increase in human technological ability.

Okay, fair enough. That all makes sense. Patryn was a cofounder, and then was just a shareholder. From a prior perspective perhaps he stepped back or was forced. Obviously now we know the problem was deeper than that. But there was only the withdrawal delays and the odd report of a failed withdrawal (which was handled fairly expertly by PR.)
\&gt; They are instead the classic warning signs of a failing exchange.
How? And, yeah, no. Years and years of successful deliveries, the addition of Canada Post as a funding source, and other recent events—including the filing of the court requests—suggested they were attempting to make more of a go of it than e.g. MtGox or the BTC-e (obviously criminal) organization did.
\&gt; To expect conclusive evidence as the warning sign to leave an exchange is unreasonable.
I didn't expect "conclusive evidence," to "leave" the exchange. I demand that you point out where I have \*ever\* told people to stay. I haven't. I explicitly and have for 8+ years told people to never leave coins on an exchange—ever. The only time coins should be on an exchange are when you are actively selling them. I have \*always\* maintained this. For 8+ years. What I am and was saying was that there \*weren't\* increase withdrawal delays. The withdrawal delays were consistent except twice—and QCX was describing alternative (and we now know, probably false) rationales for this.
\&gt; I did call you a shill, a liar, and dangerous. I strongly stand by those statements. A single post ago you were ready to hang me as an insider based on some flimsy research. While it may not have been your intent to provide false hope or justifications to stay in Quadriga, you did actively post all over reddit defending Quadriga and attacking anyone critical as a buttcoiner.
A shill gets paid. I have never been paid. Retract your libellous assertion.
You were so sure of yourself, but it turned out you were just basing your entire opinion on a badly-handled cheque. There's no way you had any other information on internal security procedures and policies. Your entire opinion—while it turned out to be correct—was not justified fully by the available public evidence. Further, the evidence you had was in fact **less** accurate than the evidence the actual users of QCX had, because you'd only ever seen what was posted on Reddit, and not used it yourself—by your own admission.
I never lied. Retract your libellous statement. Lying requires intent to deceive. I had no such intent.
I defended QCX from people who were obviously making statements which weren't backed by factual information. People like yourself were guessing at insolvency.
The fact it turned out they were doesn't mean your process at arriving at that conclusion was logically sound.
I didn't attack anyone critical of QCX. There were multiple posters who were attacking QCX and their handling of the situation that I never argued with. The **only** problem I've ever had was people posting outright fabrications or random people posting conclusions without justification. For crying out loud—go look at the barsoapguy's post history! He **explicitly states** that he hates Bitcoiners and enjoys watching them suffer! What do you expect but lies and abuse from that?
Retract your libellous comments. I have given you the courtesy of accepting you at your word—and your own comments suggest this is a problem you yourself have had. You are doing the exact same thing you complain other people are doing.

Hashfast Technologies LLC- Adversary Proceeding
Document 1
Examine p1, pg 6. And I quote:
"At the times of the Transfers, the BTC transferred to the Defendant were worth $363,861.43. Based on the value of the BTC at the time of the transfers, the Defendant received approximately $11,370 per day or $2,274 per post on the “HashFast Endorsement” thread on
Bitcointalk.org. By contrast, the highest salary paid to any principal or employee of HFT and/or HF was $144,000 for the entire calendar year of 2013."
Examine p3, pg 6. And I quote:
"At the time of the Transfers, the Debtors owed substantial sums of money and/or
equipment to numerous customers and/or vendors. Many of these obligations remain unpaid and
constitute general unsecured claims against the Estate. As of September 30, 2013, the Debtors’
balance sheet had a negative equity balance of about $5 million."

"I don't know that individual in real life or in person, but have had several positive discussions on various forums. I'm not here to defend them, and am not really very interested in the outcome of whatever legal proceedings were linked above.
I have six points:
1) I think makes an excellent point above and I largely agree.
2) Whatever legal proceedings issues purportedly involving this individual have absolutely no bearing or relevance to the statements made by the individual, because the statements stand on their own and do not rely on the individual's honesty to be true.
3) Posting links to off topic legal proceedings and tying it to someone's reddit handle during a debate about an entirely different topic is doxing. You are making a clear attempt to smear this person's reputation in an attempt to shame them publicly and/or take credibility away from their points without addressing the points directly.
4) I find this type of behavior to be distasteful, intellectually dishonest, and in stark contrast with the type of open, fact based discussions I feel we should be having about this subject.
5) I think you should delete the content of those posts immediately.
6) I think you should win arguments with logic and facts, rather than with red herrings and character assassination."
I am not the one that tied it to cypherdoc2's reddit handle.

The original price increase was almost certainly artificial as MtGox stole everyone's money.

Who needs a bitcoin clock website? Calculate it yourself.
COUNT=$( bitcoin-cli getblockcount ); echo "scale=0;((${COUNT}-(${COUNT}%210000)+210000)-${COUNT})/2016*2*7"|bc -l
Build the number of blocks to the next halving, divide it by 2016 (which is the two-week retarget period), multiply by 2 weeks per retarget, multiplied by 7 days per week.
This is a rough calculation based on the difficulty remaining completely constant the entire time.
The result is currently 364 days.
Really, you have to make an assumption that you know what hashrate is going to do over that period, but since this is unknowable, the best you can do is make an educated guess.
Given the history of the blockchain hashrate over time, which you can find here:
... you really can't say what's going to happen. Perhaps price will take a dive because of some kind of important event, and mining hashrate will equivalently fall as miners shut off their miners.
Currently, as of this writing at block 367280, -9.8% is looking to be the difference in hashrate at the next retarget. This is pretty significant. Similarly, while it seems to be falling now, a number of less-than-ethical companies such as KnC are reporting that they are going to self-mine on much more efficient chips, so perhaps overall, hashrate will climb once they do the stupid thing and dump their self-mining hashrate into the wild.
So, perhaps an overall climb of 5-10% is more reasonable, in which case we get between 327 and 345 days, which places us between June 18, and July 6 of 2016.
A more interesting estimate would be building a 3-5 knot spline of average values in the recent retargeting past and projecting it out to the next halving.

It's not even a paragraph that contains any allegations..! You need a better lawyer, he's skipping details. How can you deny the price of bitcoin at the time of transfer? It's a matter of public record! How can you deny the salaries of Hashfast's highest-paid executives? Are you in charge of Hashfast payroll?
I'm sure you are confident you'll win. When your lawyer is making statements about how you're like the equivalent of a basketball superstar in terms of bitcoin marketing in bantering with the judge, how can you not get sucked in?

The analysis fails to take into account market price response; that is, it assumes that reward is static, but it is not unless Bitcoins have no price. An active attack is visible to all full nodes. A visible attack would decrease price and double-spends are also singularly visible.
The use of mining hashrate in this fashion also *significantly decreases* total overall effective hashrate, as well as *significantly increasing* the difference between effective securing hashrate, and effective measurable hashrate, much like SPV mining does; as waste increases, price will decrease.
It also seems to fail, unless my skimming missed it, to take into account *responsive* defenders who do something other than sit passively by while the attacker attacks. That is, its assumptions about the environment in which an attack happens is passive, sterile, and filled with completely mindless robots.
Given the repsonses of F2Pool and Antpool to the recent BIP66 enforcement problems, this makes the analysis equivalently sterile and therefore, of primarily academic interest.

(edit): I would in fact say that there was basically no trust to break. And that's kind of how things are supposed to work. And that there's nothing wrong with ASICBoost until there is. And that the proposal only breaks *covert* optional ASICBoost mining.
@_date: 2017-04-06 10:07:15
Many of these assertions he's making in this article (at least as of the time I read it,) are wrong.
For example, this is wrong:


Re-arranging the TX merkle tree doesn't require shuffling of the TX itself. Literally only one grinding TX is necessary, and that's something Bitmain could do themselves—without altering the sorting order at all, but just appending a single grinding-TX at the end.
Additionally, notice he says:


This is utterly false. That is not what we'd see. Grinding a merkle root doesn't require a modification of every TX included, but in any event, he says "essentially." So there is a perturbation in there out-of-line with pure fee-per-byte sorting order, just going by his own words.


Note that gmax isn't framing just an optimization as an attack. He's calling *covertly* doing such in a way which allows ASIC manufacturers to lie to their customers and sell them equipment which is operating at 77% of its useful maximum power efficiency is a direct attack on Bitcoin decentralization.
Closing this existential threat to Bitcoin is all that he's proposing—that's why normal ASICBoost is still completely functional. We'd just be able to tell it's happening. And e.g. Bitmain wouldn't be able to covertly mine on their own equipment in a way which is completely anti-competitive and centralizing *to their own customers.*
Literally the only people arguing in a technical sense against closing the *covert* ASICBoost channel, are going to be the ones with something to lose.


Nobody said that. This is called a *straw man*, which means that this comment:


... is thus absurd. Since the proposal doesn't block ASICBoost. It only blocks it from being used *covertly.*


This is a direct lie. It is not a solution to ASICBoost. It is a solution to ASICBoost being used *covertly.*


No. Just miners.
Meanwhile, I'll point this reddit comment out, which is quite a beautifully succinct comment which anyone can use to verify at least some of the claims themselves:
Back to EGS's post:


Nobody is saying that. There are no known ways of detecting the covert ASICBoost mining attack.
Emin, in his first foray into Bitcoin research, *prior to publishing his paper in a form the public could see,* tweeted that we should all sell our Bitcoins now because, in essence, his research had broken Bitcoin. And then he published his paper.
I find this sort of action pretty reprehensible, so when he claims to be some sort of neutral third-party on the forefront of research, it's pretty obviously not true. The neutrality-as-implies-dispassion part I mean.
This post on his site is similarly, oddly, uninformed.

And yet, nobody funded them; no exchange funded them. No Bitcoin business funded them. No users stepped forward to fund them. Nobody paid any salaries to give them a reason to keep working on it in a professional capacity.
This is an absurdly pointless wish. There's been 6+ years to develop structures to assist in the development and infrastructure for Bitcoin, and the biggest attempts so far devolved into nepotistic self-enrichment schemes.
So enough with the starry-eyed idealism. In 6+ years, nothing of the like has materialized, and there's no sign of it ever happening—except, of course, when the developers themselves got together to start a company, and get funding, which they did, and now they're being mercilessly attacked for it by people exactly like you—anonymous cowards hiding behind aliases on the internet bitching about developers who found a source of funding for themselves.

It's not a discount in the sense you think people mean it. They're just calling it that because they're trying to explain it to people. It's an arbitrary amount of space that is set aside solely for the witness data. Segwit "without the discount" wouldn't make much sense. It's the way it is because they realized that you can strip out the witness data and still have old nodes validate most of what's going on—soft fork.

The word "attack" is the cryptographic form of it, which just means that they can perform less work to achieve the same result. This is an attack on the hash. It's the same word that Schneier used when he described the SHA1 attacks in the mid-2000s.

This is also the company that promised to only mine 5% of its sold hashrate on its own miners, and then proceeded to mine more than 10% of the total network hashrate; and the company the presold so much mining hardware that it was mathematically calculable in advance that it was impossible for any of their customers to have made back their purchase price.
Based on the launching of the company on these IMO fraudulent practices, I'm not surprised at all that he's randomly lashing out of his ignorance at something he didn't bother to educate himself about.
Meanwhile, it's no wonder that his company went under—his mining farms were inefficient compared to the Chinese farms, and since his company launched on IMO fraudulent practices to begin with, he was likely projecting unrealistic profit margins based on past corporate performance.

lol, no, it just seems like they should be FOMO'ing in because the value of Bitcoin seems obvious to you.

Right now, the biggest problem in Bitcoin is all the Bitcoiners repetitively trying to get more people involved by repetitively telling them things that are meant to scare or frighten them or threaten them—or, worse, by gloating about wealth, showing it off, or otherwise being a nouveau-riche egotistical jerk.
I can't stress that enough. wtf. You people. Stop trying to sell Bitcoin to normal people, and stop trying to tell them you're going to be some kind of future Bitcoin-superpowered ultraman.
Seriously, right now you telling them that sort of nonsense is the surest thing to **guarantee** that it never happens. You're doing harm. (Setting aside the fact that it probably won't happen quite that way anyway.)
Just do your thing and leave the normies alone.
Advocacy has **already worked**. Literally 85% of **entire countries** know about Bitcoin, and 5% of **entire countries** already own it. More will follow but only if you aren't shrilly in their face telling them their days are numbered.
P.S. Right now it's highly fashionable to hate on Bitcoin by cryptographers and academics due to the carbon footprint, mostly because with Bitcoin it's much easier to measure our network's impact. There is a massive semantic stopsign preventing them from reassessing—they've already made up their mind, and randomly bothering them and telling them how stupid they are is just going to **make them want to fight you.** Why would you want that?

Gavin fucked with his own head. He tried to retire on the BCF funding he was receiving, which is why we didn't hear from him for a while, and when that plan failed due to the nepotistic mismanagement of *our* donation money on the part of BCF leadership at the time, he came back and tried to be relevant again, except by then the technical community had moved on. In order to retain his relevance, he allowed first Mike Hearn to egg him on—you can see this clearly in the video where they're both drinking beer, and he smiles when Hearn says Gavin should act more like a dictator and less like a nice guy—and then Craig Wright to convince him that he had the moral authority of Satoshi himself to back him up again with the notions he had come to.
He opened himself up to the bamboozling *directly* because hope springs eternal in the human breast.

Hello strawman, and terrible mass-cite without explaining how it relates. Bitcoin transactions have never been free, except to people who understood how to trigger mempool prioritization or were miners themselves, or were friends with miners. Literally, anyone who has ever told you that Bitcoin transactions were free and/or should be free forever, was lying to you. Like brutally lying to you. Probably to convince you to give him money.

Their motivations are not clear. They had close, and intimate knowledge of the nature of review and proposals. They already knew that proposals such as Xthin/etc were torn apart after they were dumped on the public. Why was their first contact with the outside world via the uninformed press?
Meanwhile, most of the design flaws were inherited from JL's original extblocks proposals, with nothing solved. Most of the issues that Luke and JL brought up in review *were already known about from prior extblocks proposals.*
This wasn't without odd motivations. This was an attempted end-run (and a bad one) around peer review *which had already taken place.*

The terms are "full archival node" or just a "validating node." There is no "true" node only being miners nonsense, since Satoshi never predicted the existence of pooled mining, and certainly not as early as it appeared. Mining nodes are *subordinate* to the majority of full archival nodes because a mistake in their mining will be *rejected* by the network.
@_date: 2016-02-29 20:41:42
Incorrect. All of this is incorrect, and strawmanning.
1) Untrue. Core can estimate the precise cost of including a transaction within an arbitrary number of blocks. Spending Bitcoin with a fee this high is trivial. Also, you didn't offer specific examples of any wallets that have this problem. I suspect the wallets you are using are not updated and non-functional by comparison.
2) A jug of milk is not divisible. No supermarkets will break a typical block of cheese for you. A table is not divisible. A television is not divisible. This objection is irrelevant. Transactions themselves *are* divisible, into their individual component inputs, in much the same way that a crate of bags of potato chips is divisible. Transaction *space* on a per-byte basis, is what is being bid for, not the transactions themselves.
3) There are so many examples of things, objects, and market items which are limited and where supply can't increase to meet demand that this objection is similarly absurd. Except you're wrong: since SegWit, and/or increasing the block size, and/or offchain TX, and/or LN, and/or sidechains, all can trivially contribute to increasing available transaction space and with the exception of offchain TX, all are equivalently secure with varying granularity.

Except KnC IMO defrauded their customers by:
1) Selling so much hashrate it was predictably trivial to calculate that no customer of theirs *could possibly* make back their investment.
2) Promising to self-mine with only 5% of their sold hashrate, then mining with 10% of *the entire network hashrate.*
3) Potentially delivering devices to customers that were of lesser tested quality than the devices they eventually mined with in-house.
Since their initial catapult into success was based at least in part on this form of deception, it is not hard to imagine why they were so starving for cash when they attempted internal-mining legitimacy.

You're being illogical. The *space* must be purchased in units that the vendor (the miners) are willing to sell. The transaction, as I have demonstrated, is divisible into smaller units than most people are aware. Your counter-counter-examples actually reinforce my examples.
Don't presume to know who wants my grandmother's paintings; the demand is not universal, much like the demand for space in the blockchain; similarly, you don't know whether my family dog is a purebred champion or not; "tens of thousands of people" is a number you have absolutely no verifiable cites for; the analogies I am making are therefore valid due to the arbitrary (in Bitcoin's case, byte-delineated) space divisions.
A normal marketplace: thanks to my *succinct* examples, I have disproven your assertion that it is unrelated to the space available in the blockchain by giving you simple things that can, in fact, be perfectly related.
Therefore, your assertions are false. And continue to be false.

No; if you're going to be modifying Tor, then the one thing that's cleanly doable is modifying HS to have scaleable authenticated access. The Tor HS itself can decide what is authenticated and valid traffic, and what isn't; thus, for all that traffic which is DDoS, it removes that from the authenticated access list and updates the authenticated signers list with the RP.
This requires a form of ring- or group-sig that is at the very least log(n) or better in size.
This would be equivalent to the old-school source-quench, except in this case the Tor HS has the *potential* to be perfectly-competent in defending itself against DDoS.
In the case of a Tor HS which requires e.g. user signups to begin with to be actively used, all that's really necessary is an introducer-hierarchy to go with that and Bob's your uncle.
It's never been that the target has control over the connectivity to it that the attacker uses to perform the attack. It's possible for a Tor HS defender to do this, but only with an upgraded protocol option. Then it's just a plain attack on the Tor network itself and accomplishes nothing or next-to-nothing.
Note: PoW as a gatekeeper for access is highly vulnerable to botnets. It is a non-starter. It won't solve anything.

I think a lot of those examples might not be strictly correct since the reverse has to be interpretable as a reversal given knowledge of the nature of the Soviet era government.
The canonical example is: "In America, there's plenty of light beer and you can always find a party. In Russia, Party always finds you."
Except the party of partygoers can still find you and you all can have a great time—except in Soviet Russia the Party was an actual political thing. :)

Lying. This comment, for example:


If he knew what he was talking about, he would know that reverse-engineering functionality of a chip can simply be a black-box guess-and-test process and does not require any electron microscopes whatsoever.
And, given that even here on reddit a bunch of users are busily describing in detail the amount of clues in the firmware which can simply be strings'd, an actual chip-level reversal was not necessary at all—they could simply discover the commands used to get it running on ASICBoost mode, and feed those to it, as per the firmware download hints, and then measure the results.


This is a pointless, FUD'ing strawman. It is loose evidence. It is not proof. In fact, gmax explicitly states that ASICBoost covert channels are covert:


In other words, this "people" claiming that empty blocks are proof are simply insufficiently educated about the problem to be making that claim, and therefore, Sam Cole is pointlessly arguing against a totally irrelevant claim.


This is utterly absurd. The fix doesn't close off ASICBoost at all. In fact, it explicitly continues to promote its overt use by narrowly targeting the covert ASICBoost method and **ONLY** the covert ASICBoost method!

VC money in my admittedly limited experience only seems to come with strings if the corp needs their money more than the VC wants into the company.
At the moment, we have a degree of transparency entirely unheard of in the open source world. Just take a look at the NetBSD foundation for an example of a non-profit open source project. What's going on there? Not a clue. How many core-only lists are there now? No clue. Where's the release engineering process documented and released so people can duplicate it? Beats me. It's still my favourite OS, but I accepted a long time ago that I wouldn't get the kind of total transparency that would have been nice.
How about Linux? *Do* we know any of the same sorts of things we know about the (irritatingly few) corporations actually funding Bitcoin? Nope.
And that's at the OS level. That's the thing on which Bitcoin is supposed to securely run.
Realistically, surely you can agree on the possibility at least, it is more likely to me that people want things like detailed financial dispositions of individual developers so they can use the information as a weapon.
The NetBSD foundation, around for longer, with a more varied donation source, could be eliminated with basically a single lawsuit.
Now look at Ver and his presumed 450,000 btc or 33,000 btc or whatever it is he owns now minus whatever scams he got screwed by.. What's going to realistically shield people from that except reputation—and given the sustained, funded, long-term attacks of crazy people, that is these days in fairly short supply and in any event would be shaky to begin with thanks to the naked lies of Mark Karpeles, who if you'll recall blamed core *explicitly* for the thefts of MtGox by asserting they didn't "fix" malleability fast enough—when there wasn't even really a *way* to fix it planned at the time and it was a lie anyway!
I don't think there was an option to go non-profit. And besides that, the vast majority of people developing now aren't even associated with Blockstream. But, at least we have *some* people who are coding under that umbrella, and coding in a way that isn't dictated by angry technical people who are on the decks of sinking ships (like Mark Karpeles was) or greedy non-technical people who lie repeatedly but nobody seems to care (like.. lots of other people around Bitcoin.)

That wasn't the explicit goal; I recognise that the actual goal is some kind of reputation system. The problem as I see it is that *as part of that* OB is (questionably purposefully) economically incentivizing users to de-anonymize *themselves,* and discussing the possibilities of chain analysis being a third-party trust metric—this means economically incentivizing people to deanonymize *each other.*
That's an attack on Bitcoin fungibility, too. The most important thing you guys (presumably you're one of the devs the way you're talking) can do is make user safety and privacy *a primary goal.* It's super unfortunate that Bitcoin's ledger is so transparent and that wallets like Jaxx or Breadwallet are so crappy with their opsec, but jumping wholly into it and casting privacy aside is super dangerous if you're going to be integrating Tor and/or I2P into it. Why bother without trying hard to guarantee user privacy? What's the point except advertising buzz?
Why, exactly, are you trying to integrate Tor at all?

This is a lie too. Your only evidence was in fact a reference to *dust* transactions which had their own special-casing in the code.

Okay, let's back up, and I'll just pretend for the moment you are in fact trying to maintain an accurate opinion.

This is false. Your understanding of transaction graph analysis is broken.

@_date: 2016-09-02 05:53:03
Okay. I accept all that you assert about your personal history as true for the sake of not being a dick.


First off, the amount of money raised would be limited to public funding and donations. VC capital would be unavailable, correct? Considering the anaemic state of other similar foundations (for example, the NetBSD foundation) I hardly think it would have been effective considering the total lack of donations and funding that was available to (then) date. And, considering the state of sponsorship for *non* Blockstream developers, I hardly think much money would have been forthcoming anyway.


This is probably false. Consider that the Bitcoin Foundation was meant to be an assist in funding e.g. Gavin Andresen and goverment lobbyists (which it did) and now literally everyone who worked for it is now shouldering the blame for extreme mismanagement and public vilification.
Meanwhile, they barely had enough money to pay Gavin's salary for the short time it did! That was one guy..! You're an optimistic person if you think this org would have done much but fizzle the way the BCF did.
And, in fact, there *were* other orgs that were meant to supplant the BCF. But they all fizzled too.


I'll leave aside the interpretation of that as a snide remark and just assert that your last sentence is probably more accurate. Most of those kids I'd be willing to bet didn't create the corps for themselves.
The creation of such a developer-oriented foundation would not have cemented anything in anyone's public mind. It just would just have made them more of a defenceless target for the hundred-million-dollar well-funded orgs that were already on their way to going after them with the blame-game.
Even the Ethereum Foundation can't really be called a non-profit, and they are suffering considerably under strong negative public sentiment as a result of their hard-fork clawback.
You are right—the protections of a non-profit might have given them some form of legal protection; still, you have to admit that without a strong funding source the realistic protection it would have offered would have been minimal and trivially pierced.
(edit: Besides, there are only a few developers hired by Blockstream, and there's really only the fairly significant effort required to manage such a corp getting in the way of the rest of the devs collecting into an organization, so most of this is really speculation on our part, right?)

No. Solvency is the ability to pay long-term debt off. Solvency means that they have assets greater than liabilities. If you include the bank drafts and believe their assertion that the drafts were endorsed to them by Billerfy for deposit into their new BMO account, then those are firmly in the assets column. By all current public information, they are solvent. They're just illiquid. Well. "Just." Clearly it's messing with their business.
(edit: And clearly they were operating without access to Cotten's wallet. Not cool. But this information was not public, which means it was impossible to have known for sure one way or the other. Lame.)

The claim that Satoshi planned for and intended to increase the block size is false and a lie. There is at best ambiguous evidence which suggests he thought of a way it could be phased in—but even that was after explicitly shouting down jgarzik, who was suggesting a blocksize change in direct code, and there is no indication that he directly supported it.

Well in this case, it does, since the ability to maintain decentralization is explicitly wrapped up in the security propositions of Bitcoin. We're talking about cryptocurrency. The term itself *does* have special meaning, since we didn't make up a term for use in Bitcoin which is explicitly defined anywhere, right?
Additionally, if you wanted a dictionary definition (which is the definition in English use and not cryptocurrency) then why did you ask me in the context of whether I thought BitShares was "controlled" by a single person? And, why did you ask me what *my* definition of the term was?


And you are defending an author-enrichment scam which could have its history trivially rewritten by the so-called "Delegate" nodes which were literally centralizing *while I was watching them.*
I *would* call you a "DPoS fraudster," were I inclined to start name-calling, as you just rudely did. Why are you taking my criticism of an obvious fraudulent system so personally?


That was a pre-posted comment, unfortunately, which was in the midst of being edited when I was interrupted. Sorry for the shitty grammar. I was trying to say "being unreasonably high." In other words, it *appears* as though you are okay with mining being a strictly farm-based, pool-based mechanism.
I am not. It wrecks decentralization of Bitcoin.


I have *zero trouble at all* pointing out a large number of Vitalik's arguably fraudulent failings. Quoting him and one of his hand-wavy "theories" as a reliable authority is.. probably not the best thing you could be doing in an argument with me.


Knowing its rules is not the trust part. Trusting that you have received the real rules of a system is the trust part. If that's what you meant then, yea, I agree. In Bitcoin, trusting that you have received the rules correctly is in part handled by the fact that Bitcoin has a gitian build system, dozens of signatures, is open source, and is being pored over by thousands of eyes and brains.
For many of *those* people, many people are also able to mathematically calculate many of those security properties including the difficulty required to overwrite old rules. Whatever is really meant by the lie of "weak subjectivity," it is not the reason why I think that PoS is weaker than PoW. And yes, it turns out that Vitalik has also AFAICT misapprehended the idea of what we mean when we say "there's nothing at stake."


When the cost of rewriting ancient history is approximately zero, then "so weak it is effectively broken" is a little more accurate.


What pointless strawman tribal signalling. You really think I don't understand the nature of practical attacks on PoW? Why do you have to pollute an otherwise clean comment with personal attack?

A "core" OB developer said this:


The team itself said this:


The project lead said:


..  and then they all blocked me, because presumably I'm a dangerous mind-altering substance that makes people say strange illogical and false things that have—as far as I can tell—almost zero basis in reality.
OpenBazaar is funded by Union Square Ventures:
Union Square Ventures lists Fred Wilson as part of their venture capitalist team.
Fred Wilson and the OpenBazaar team regularly post about each other, and here's Brian Hoffman defending Fred Wilson for being apparently willing to invest in an absurd ROT13 "compromise":




This isn't a huge deal. People troll or make mistakes all the time. The actual problem with Fred Wilson is that he unfortunately endorses cryptography backdoors:
Yes. That's Fred Wilson. Yes, that is crypto backdoor advocacy *nonsense.* This is the guy Brian Hoffman is busily defending on Twitter.
Meanwhile, I would also like to strongly point out, to those people considering using OpenBazaar to sell things that they might get in trouble for, the following two blog entries from the OpenBazaar team:
Scroll down to this (part 1 of 2) where it says:


(Part 2 of 2), and then scroll down to the "Filters" part. The part about *Blockchain ID* and *Coin Analysis* should be *extreme* warning signs to anyone concerned with their own privacy. The OpenBazaar team is *explicitly* putting design work into de-anonymization efforts based on *coin analysis and incentivized self-identification methods.*
In complete contradiction to the above, I have been told that in private the entire selling point of OB was that it *was* a libertarian-style shades-of-black-market. Given the odd positions the team held even just five months ago, the distancing they put between themselves and Amir Taaki, and the fact that user privacy was not a primary goal as per the above posts, it is **crucial** that people are well-informed about potential information leakage (such as from their own wallet software,) and it is **crucial** that OpenBazaar itself is re-verified not to leak information about its users while running in Tor-only mode via, for example, the IP-linked GUID they reference in the above two reputation blog posts.
Otherwise, *what the hell is the point in integrating with Tor or I2P*?
I would normally be interested in hearing the rationale the OB team uses to reconcile Fred Wilson's and their own contradictory views with how they are ostensibly now enabling grey- and black-market activity with Tor integration, but these days with all the criminal activity sitting out there in the open that nobody seems to give a crap about, all I really care about is that they make damned sure they do their work in a way that doesn't get people killed.

"The GUID is a key that multiple values can be attributed to (e.g. an IP address and port). The key remains immutable (unchangeable) while the value is mutable (changeable). For example, Alice’s GUID on the OpenBazaar network remains constant even though her IP address/port changes depending on whether she connects to the network from home or work."
So *switching to* the Tor-only option will presumably leave the GUID intact, which is the user's or the vendor's semi-permanent identity and linked/known via other means.
The Tor Browser Bundle is fairly careful about not storing long-term state especially across tabs or across multiple invocations. It does this to prevent people from using it from being arrested by repressive regimes and murdered.
I respect that you mentioned you respect users' privacy—but it seems you're now *undoing* or *mitigating* design work which is fundamentally incompatible with user privacy to begin with. :-(
This is consistent then with my notions of the development process of OB, and this is why I'm warning people about using it for illegal activity, and why I'm so skeptical about trusting it to maintain user privacy absent external auditing.

No, it's not plausible that Kleiman is the sole miner of all those early coins, as I've already described at length now—one would have to both accept Sergio's fake analysis, and that Kleiman was Satoshi to think he owns all those early coins, and that nobody else mined, which is absurd, since Hal Finney is well known to have been one of the early miners.

But I am complaining about it in here mostly because no normal users are expert enough to understand what actions in their wallet will combine their winnings or income from that address, and most users don't know how to spend things with single inputs to ensure the segregation of their wallet funds.
One way might be to configure a second wallet entirely, but then the places you spend it to have to be completely different too.
It's possible, and if you're careful or don't care—sure. Just remember that this one taint will provide information that can be subpoena'd about your source IP addresses from Twitter, and everything in your Twitter feed can thus be used to derive information about your identity.
(And false narratives for that matter.)
CoinCorner themselves are probably fine. But contests like this which encourage people to publish their information in a public Twitter feed *in the past* have **widely** de-anonymized a massive number of wallet clusters.

Your comments about the GnuPG key backdating have been **definitively** shown to be a failed key backdating effort in a followup argument I and a couple others had with CSW himself here on Reddit.
Consider updating your post with the new facts:
The "plausible" key "hygiene" argument which CSW tried to further didn't take into account the fact that when you edit GPG keys, internal timestamps are updated to reflect this, but those timestamps all matched the creation date, which proves based on the method CSW tried to imply he used (and insisted anyone could replicate, including a download link to the Windows GnuPG executable!!) that the key itself was never edited after the fact, which means we're directly back to CSW being a weird time traveller *and a horrible liar*, or more likely, he simply backdated the keys.
Note the key itself in the entropy.html file had an SKS version on it which didn't exist at the time of the backdated blog entry.
Further, I have a copy of the SKS dataset as of February 2012, and *Craig's key definitely does not exist in it.*
I am quite happy to share this copy of the SKS global keyset with anyone, and I did for a while.

No, this is incorrect. There is zero evidence at all that it was an anti-spam measure. In fact, the associated evidence that makes people think this is actually another set of commits entirely which addressed the dust issue.


Nobody's "keeping" the 1MB blocksize. Like literally nobody.


I don't know what your measure of stagnation is, but from any measures that are meaningful in my mind, it isn't stagnant. In terms of economic growth; in terms of VC investment; in terms of code development; nothing in that list is stagnant.

No, "simple math" doesn't show that amount as plausible. It's not remotely plausible. That's the whole point—Sergio's analysis was bunk and rested on the notion that all unspent early coins were Satoshi's. But this is nonsense, since the theory as is doesn't account for the two blocks that Satoshi did appear to spend from, and the theory *includes* blocks that other people mined. Further, it ignores the fact that the timestamp of the first block didn't occur until someone *joined* the first node some 8 or so hours after the software was released—which is about the time it would take to get someone else in there, and this early software mined by default.
So the idea is completely absurd. There's no evidence that those early coins *aren't* Satoshi's than there is evidence that they are.
I'm hung up on the address because of some very simple reasons:
1) The MtGox leaks show very clearly who owned the 1933... address.
2) The filing states that these coins are Kleiman's based on pp. 76(b) due to the fraudulent "2012 Deed of Loan." If the coins weren't being claimed by anybody, then why would 76(b) state that this fraudulent document described the current disposition of "Dave's" bitcoins?

The Pirate Bay isn't a multi-billion dollar enterprise built around a new way to transfer money between end-users. The possibility that it is now a honey-pot is real, but otherwise irrelevant to the users that use it. Bitcoin on the other hand could only survive if it were strongly decentralized. Trusting the few nodes of Bitcoin to whoever runs the Pirate Bay would essentially end Bitcoin as we know it.

No. People are attacking it because it's a lawsuit that is going to get wrecked on examination, and its shitty form means Craig isn't going to be seriously challenged by it.
The 1933... address being an item of fraudulence is not explained, described, nor shown to be an outside address that is not itself under dispute—indeed, it describes two *conflicting* documents under which the only dispute is to whom the rights belong. The conflict between the address's disposition is the issue!
The numerology is Sergio's numerology, upon which **ALL** unfounded claims of Satoshi's hoard are based. Sergio Demian Lerner is the source of enormous amounts of disinformation stemming almost entirely from his piece on Satoshi's stash, which has been directly debunked many times by many people but persists because people think Satoshi was the only one mining early on.
This is not the case.
Your "139" days is equally as numerological as Sergio's fake analysis.
If there's going to be a legal attack on Craig, it should be airtight, logical, and based on factual information. The more Craig withstands these forms of attack, the more his followers/shills/socks can claim authority of right.
The fact that you don't understand this speaks volumes.

Nobody's permanently keeping 1MB blocks. That is a lie.


Until someone does a full fraud-proof implementation, that section is not applicable to any software currently in existence.

I am saying many bcash holders *sold* their bcash, and indiscriminately *bought* Bitcoins, without caring at all what the price was.


That is a meaningless product. It tells us nothing about the state of the market, or the nature of the economy. You can't extract that much value out of it. You can't sell that  many Bitcoins and expect to receive even a portion of that, over time.


We don't, though. We don't know how much is out there, and in any event, even knowing that much, it's a guess as to whether they are mobile or not, and certainly doesn't tell us about market conditions.
Meanwhile, the term "market capitalization" refers to a stock market term, and Bitcoins are not a stock.
It just makes us look like idiots to people who actually do operate in the stock markets.
Do you think there's a USD "market cap"? How about a USD "market cap" in terms of some other currency? The term itself is inapplicable.


Current market price, modulo order books, is enough to measure the value of the bitcoin you yourself hold and could conceivably sell.
The logic doesn't apply to the whole Bitcoin market/economy.

That's not correct, and your example is stretching it completely. There are ways to reconstruct share ownership even in the face of complete record failure on the part of the company storing your records—but you didn't say that. You said *a share certificate.* That is the thing you own and store at your own home in lieu of being forced to sign a document stating you lost said certificates and need a replacement.
If the *office* burns down, then you simply produce your share certificate and you're done.


What the heck man, that's what you're doing?!


Give me a number. I'm willing to bet you'll get it wrong.

Aside from the odd things it enables, by itself there's nothing wrong with mining an empty block. It's just that it signals other things when Bitmain does it, as their devices are built with ASICBoost enabled.
But, by itself, empty blocks still contribute to the security of the system by piling work on older blocks.

Holy, totally irrelevant Batman.
If the devs won't work on it, there's no point in anybody else agreeing that it should be done. They'll just keep working on the stuff they're interested in working on, and quite honestly, I'm pretty sure that once they collectively decide something's a bad idea, trying to force them into working on that bad idea is..
.. shall we say, "counterproductive."
Did you even look at the Segwit support chart? It's not just segwit they're commenting on there. Who else is going to work on that s8x trash? The copyright thief, deadalnix? Or how about the guy who doesn't know how broken his code is and won't tell anybody who's paying him?

The inconsistencies suggest to me there's at least a chance he's just strongly impetuous. Some of what he's saying (at least now) is interpretable more than one way. It's super odd that he'd randomly go on about bcash being a suitable payment layer—however, and this is really nice, watching the various accounts out there try to schmooze him when he makes comments like that, and especially the ones that serially like them, is an interesting semi-permanent record.
But it would sure suck if he sold his account/identity to someone. That would be quite expensive, and very difficult for pretty much any of the bcashers I've ever seen write, to simulate due to their typically crappy vocabulary, spelling, and grammar.

No—the agreement is with the plural of "leaders."

Ah. I see. Thanks for explaining it. I thought you meant the mempool outside of what transactions get included into blocks. I would offer that the equivalent increase in fee price to be included into blocks (in the event that blocks are full, as they currently aren't,) would wipe that savings out. I don't think that the equivalent pressures on having transactions confirmed as a result of the less-blockspace would equivalently remain the same: that is, I don't think the *base cost* representing the demand to get transactions confirmed would do the equivalent of *shrinking* in the presence of empty blocks.
This is why I felt confusion. I thought you were referring to the mempool itself and its limited size in most nodes.

I have a link to a comment where he admitted accepting money via the donations button:
So that's 7 payments he said he received.
He also stated that he forked the MIT-licence site and claims that he had a right to do so (obviously for the fork itself he did) but conflates that right without explicitly clarifying, with accepting and keeping donations on behalf of core.
The site at the time listed "Donate" buttons underneath the project names.
Donations are not "funding advertising campaign" buttons.
(edit later)
And it turns out there was a story on r\bitcoin about it:
Note that the page itself had no-to-little indication that the Donate buttons weren't donation buttons but *position* bumping buttons. If you linked directly there it wasn't clear that was the case. Navigating *to* that page from within the site did make it more clear. The page itself was not clear at all, however.

No, it isn't the same. When you buy a share certificate, you are the recorded owner. If you lose your shares, you fill out a form, and an affidavit, and you get your shares back.
You can't just fill out a form and get your Bitcoins back.
And I defy you to calculate the current number of mined coins in existence. You'll get it wrong—by a small amount, but you'll get it wrong.
Additionally, the current number of mined bitcoins is not a meaningful number without a known-lost count. And that count is impossible to determine.
@_date: 2017-09-25 23:04:36


Yes, it does. But it still piles work on the existing blockchain. The "secure the chain" part is satisfied with empty blocks, and there's no reasonable way to prevent empty blocks.
More realistically, empty blocks also change the nature of the fee market, which in any event has been significantly reduced recently. The most-recent statistics I have seen are a &lt;1MB average blocksize and on my highly-connected nodes I have regularly seen mempool backlog cleared repeatedly.
Currently, empty blocks are not really an issue.
Given Bitcoin's current popularity generally, I would say that this is an indicator that empty blocks were never really an issue.

How many developers supported BIP-148?
Besides, when I say "nobody cared," I'm saying that there wouldn't be crushing disappointment in the event segwit failed to activate. Clearly the majority wanted segwit—segwit happened. Great! Lots of innovation can happen more easily, now, and the security assumptions about TX are now slightly more secure.
That is, people like gmax have stated explicitly that he would have been fine with segwit not being activated. To my view, it would have meant that the huge clamour for more space in the blockchain was just a pretence.

The first issue simple: nobody is going to be willing to give up the airdrop as a mechanism to acquire additional Bitcoins in a wealth transfer—from those users who are irrationally adopting S2X, to those users who are willing to trade with the S2X users and *want* to trade with them.
You logic is flawed a second way, too: everyone who receives a payment on the original chain is incentivized so long as S2X exists, to replay the spending transaction into the S2X chain *as soon as they can* in order to benefit via such a replay attack until the chains diverge too much to make this a viable possibility.
Therefore, *even users who don't want to worry about S2X are going to have their potential S2X coins ripped off from them by all receivers of coins on the real BTC chain, and unjustly enrich themselves thereby.*
So, you are not only incorrect; you are critically incorrect.

Reddit, unfortunately, has become a seriously divisive, and trivially-abused speech platform, due to the triviality of sock-puppetting, and the total apathy on the part of Reddit admins to put a stop to it.
At some point in the (probably) near future, Reddit will be replaced with something that more-adequately addresses these sorts of problems, and the endless socking will go away. (That is, highly-paid groups of shitheads won't be able to as-easily infiltrate a community with their criminal scum-baggery.)

Deprecated *but not insecure.*
A measly 1.83% remain *vulnerable*. The rest are updated and actively maintained post-security vulnerability updates.
*Some* miners support 2X. *Some* businesses support S2X. All current polls describe an overwhelming majority of users do not support a fork from the primary chain.
Additionally, we can graphically see this support via the bcash signalling of the massive dumps users were doing of their bcash airdrop. The dumps on bcash are identical and match up with the known Twitter and non-Sybil'able polls conducted by Luke of Coinbase users. This numerical superiority is also reflected in the near-total lack of developers who are willing to work with Garzik on the S2X fork.
The only way to conclude that there is some doubt about the NoS2X majority is to conclude the following:
* S2X supporters are a *tiny* economic minority but are numerically superior, and
* S2X supporters never participate in polls, and
* S2X supporters don't want their intentions known to the other users, and
* S2X supporters either don't want to, or can't run fully-validating nodes, and
* Non-S2X users are a **massive** economic majority, and
* Non-S2X users have **massively** sybil'd the fully-validating nodes in the network, and
* Non-S2X users are totally out-of-proportion willing to make their intentions known to each other, and
* Non-S2X users have managed to somehow Sybil the verified Coinbase user population, and
* Coinbase verification is severely broken and they will be shut down soon as a result, and
* Non-S2X developers are uniformly, in the hundreds-strong, bought or scared out of working on the S2X chain, and
* Almost everyone working or immersed in Bitcoin-related topics knows most of the above but pretends they don't.
* The S2X supporters who are vocal are virtually all pseudonymous; virtually all hostile; support criminality; disproportionately support Craig Wright as being Satoshi; support the commercial use of the r\btc subreddit; tolerate and therefore condone criminal threats made by their fellow users; and serially support all hostile forking attempts and have for years (from -xt to -classic to -bu to -abc now to -btc1); disproportionately seem to be paid by Roger Ver; accept funding from undisclosed sources; accept grants from Bitmain; are unapologetic copyright thieves; and disproportionately claim to be divested from Bitcoin.
It is irrational to presume that the NoS2X user base is anything but a majority.

No. That is not true. There is no evidence that the people coming *into* the market are the ones responsible for buying up all the higher prices. In fact, with the recent release of bcash, I would argue that a large sum of Bitcoins were bought *by prior owners of Bitcoin* as they dumped their worthless bcash and bought Bitcoin.
Yes, the current price has meaning. Obviously.
The error in judgement lies both in using the **misnomer** "market cap" and applying it to a currency (tell me again what the market cap of USD is,) **or even using the product of price times some random made-up number to begin with.**
I guarantee you that nobody *doing* that calculation knows how many Bitcoins are in circulation.

As soon as you can see the S2X supporters (Roger Ver, Garzik, Jihan) refusing to do any  major swaps for their S2Xcoins with actual Bitcoiners—who pretty much all would happily do so, it became universally obvious.
Bitcoin *isn't Bitcoin* if a single related group of companies can randomly take control of it. Since S2X is therefore not Bitcoin, people prefer to exit "S2Xcoin". Roger Ver and friends aren't willing to commit all their coins. That's why he's only talking about 1k bets and randomly hedging small amounts.
This is precisely why S2X was a doomed effort as soon as we all collectively signalled to each other our intentions with bcash and realized that the propaganda was exactly that.

Bitcoin Cash is written by Amaury Sechet—and somebody called freetrader. Amaury stripped the copyright notice from the top of a file from a core developer, and put his own name instead. This is illegal. He was told about it, and asked to fix it—his response was that he wanted sipa himself to ask. Rick Falkvinge promised a massive PR campaign if a lawsuit was ever filed. Amaury still hasn't corrected the error—in other words, he's an unapologetic copyright thief.
There are no other developers for Bitcoin Cash. They repeatedly assert that "if" bcash becomes canonical that all the developers will magically eat crow and come over and develop under the copyright thief as project lead.
Bitcoin cash has an emergency difficulty adjustment algorithm (EDA) which allows miners to play games with inflation in bcash. With strategic mining, it is possible to, for much less effort, advance the block count enormously for short periods of time.
There are currently only a small number of very centralized miners mining on bcash.
Craig S. Wright, the guy who pretends to be Satoshi but to any sane technical individual with an ability to reason, obviously isn't (see Contrarian__'s excellent posts for a brief sketch of the state-of-Craig,) claims that bcash is going to be the sole recipient of his dozens of PhD expert brain trust patent pool, and he is going to try to kill Bitcoin by starving it of all the new awesome technology.
So far the glimpses we've seen show that he is delusional and lies pathologically.
Bitcoin—the real one—has hundreds of people making changes in it—people who go through the process and commit on the whole very well-reviewed commits.
Amaury commits massive thousands-of-lines-worth of formatting changes which make following his work (which is hosted somewhere else and only code-dumps on Github) difficult. It also makes merging the fixes to real-Bitcoin vastly harder for Amaury.
Amaury don't give a crap about that though!
Finally, we know who is paying most of the core devs. Bitmain is funding a part of Amaury's work. Other work including funding in the BU foundation and funding to Tom Zander (the altcoin devs who barely get along with each other but typically make fail-attempts to be compatible with each other) has a completely unknown source.

ETC implemented replay protection, as did ETH. So, no, they didn't create a fork by which a replay attack could steal users' money.
As they are right now, the two chains explicitly support anti-replay methods. In other words, my point was that they didn't explicitly do so *just so the replay itself could be used as an attack on Ethereum, the same way that Bitmain et al were threatening to do with Bitcoin.*

You won't like the results of this if they can redefine the meaning of the term Bitcoin. It'll end up pitting Bitcoin owners directly against investment owners in the event of a.. disagreement.. as to what constitutes Bitcoin, which would place a massive centralizing importance on lobbying the person or persons responsible for making this decision on behalf of the fund. In essence, depending on the wording of their definition of Bitcoin, they could choose to go with S2X—and only the larger money dinners and hobnobbing to which none of us are privvy will have any effect whatsoever on the results.

You can assert it is so, but it is not. The literal majority of development that's happened in the codebase has been to make it strong enough to keep up with growth up to and including the expected SW growth.


I don't see Satoshi coming out to agree with you. I don't see any signed notes. I don't see emails.. I don't see code. I see a fraudster hitching his train to your wagon, but I don't see any sign that Satoshi agreed with your weird plan for the future.
The way he spoke, it's more like he *didn't* have a plan at all for Bitcoin's future growth, and your comments implying you are some kind of keeper of Satoshi's "vision" are pretty hilariously egotistical.
There's no evidence you were even there. I was there before he left. I'm pretty sure I have a better idea of what Bitcoin is, or isn't, than you do, and since *we* told you about bitcoin in the beginning, I find it pretty amazing how that message has shifted so radically.

The main issue there is that their developer is an unapologetic copyright thief who obfuscates the work he does in it—so people aren't free to use it commercially because this presents an existential risk to the chain. If they hook their wagons up to it, they adopt that risk themselves.

No, they aren't getting better. They're getting worse, because the only developers behind which anyone would consider climbing, are people who *had* PR'able credibility in the past. Jeff Garzik is the last jerk from the old bad days that hasn't already burned his reputation failing yet. But he's close.
Nobody's going to accept a chain written by a copyright thief, or basically an unmaintained one.
The r\btc party line is to assert that all the developers will simply "follow the money." **Except none of them are getting paid to follow the ecosystem, because the ecosystem doesn't pay them.**
So no, they're not getting better. The only way to get better would be to find a team which can be more transparent, is more capable, does better engineering, and creates a superior result—except the people who can do that just end up joining Core.
So, hilariously, no. None of that is true.

The above point is false. It *is* possible to scale Bitcoin to "VISA" levels. Note they cop out by claiming that we need to scale on-chain to VISA levels, as though every $0.50 transaction should be on-chain and requires the block-level granularity of the full hashrate.
This is obviously not the case, or else exchange transactions would be considered unsafe—except people, including the people in r\btc, dump thousands of dollars into an exchange and trade with it. So, clearly, they don't need every $0.50 transaction to be on-chain.

Please stop listening to whoever or whatever told you Bitcoin was anonymous. People have literally been saying, loudly, in public (including a live TV interview done with Garzik almost right at the start) that it is not anonymous and never has been, from 2011 onwards. Bitcoin is not anonymous. Neither do tumblers actually tumble coins.
The power costs of running the network are in *many* cases, carbon neutral and thus that objection is mostly incorrect.
It was never suitable for micro-transactions. Even in the early days, you were forced to find someone who would even accept your coins to do a small transaction in the first place.

I was describing a very narrow definition of what I think is secure in Bitcoin itself and properties which are required to maintain Bitcoin's decentralization; additionally, I am implying deliberately that altcoin solutions are *less than* the security provided by Bitcoin. Dash, for example, with its preminer masternode majority, is a direct counter-example to your assertion that PoW+PoS is superior.
In fact, at this point I think you *haven't* described your definition accurately since the dictionary English term is meaningless to the discussion at hand. Additionally, I think you are *avoiding* providing me with an equivalent definition because you think it was a weakness to provide one—and I think your attempt at baiting me into providing a definition which you could then strawman was dishonest because you are now claiming that the context in which it was asked was something which you not only refused to delineate and describe in advance, but which seems to be conveniently fluid.


What an absurd notion. Your comparison is false and I think you are being deliberately offensive. Religious dogma is only religious dogma when it is not informed by science, experience, logic, and empirical data. Additionally, claiming that I am a logic-less religious-like person w.r.t. this discussion is petty. Normally at this point I would be gladly and gleefully tearing a strip off you after giving me a reason to sink to your level, but since I believe you are deliberately baiting me again, I will simply say:  You probably shouldn't have indicated you were one of the authors of a paper. Based on this context I believe you are doing your co-authors a disservice with your pettiness.


Or I was reading into what your definitional request was actually about and gave you a Bitcoin-specific definition of properties in Bitcoin which directly contribute and are *required* for Bitcoin to maintain its decentralized status, and your odd definitional attack is hilarious because you have offered no specific counter-definition which you haven't already invalidated by claiming that it is irrelevant.
Or are you saying PoA is your response and you are unwilling to as-succinctly define the requirements for decentralization in an ideal coin, yourself, here in this thread, without resorting to direct quotes from your papers?


You are defending PoS mostly blindly. The implementations of PoS in Bitshares, in Dash, and in other coins are implemented in *broken fashion.* Since I am attacking explicitly specific altcoins, then you should now know that I am attacking PoS as it exists in *all* deployed systems.
If you are defending PoS as it exists in some hypothetical perfect implementation, you have so far not been doing a great job of it.
Additionally, I will go one further. It is *not possible* to implement PoS in a way which provides the same guarantees that adequately-decentralized PoW does, based on current science and as far as I'm aware.


Your own research is flawed. I read your paper when it came out, and its conclusions are incorrect. Meanwhile, if you were paying attention, you would have noticed that I explicitly included the idea of a PoW which does not exist in deployed form in my definition. So, in your paper when you and your co-authors state, "One major risk is centralization, as data centers that are dedicated to PoW computations and transactions verification may
outcompete hobbyist miners, due to economies of scale." — I have addressed this by describing a form of ASIC which currently does not exist but which would address this — currently rapidly growing — problem in Bitcoin's PoW ecosystem. On top of that, in my opinion assertions such as this are false anyway, since hobbyist miners have potentially far fewer *additional* expenses than some datacentres do.


I do. I roughly outlined it in my definition which you demanded absent any context and you then manufactured a context contrary to the one I was answering in. Congratulations, you trapped me with silly word games and then went straight off on that attack horse without even bothering to clarify, and while refusing to provide your own definition outside of a totally, obviously inapplicable dictionary definition.
I'll re-quote mine here since perhaps you'll discover this time around I've built in an anticipation of your contextual attack:


Note that I did not claim this was a complete definition. Meanwhile, now that we are both claiming our ideals have no basis in reality, I'm not sure why you are bothering to argue with me about it. I'll assert this: there are no such things in deployed systems as successful PoS and therefore at the moment Bitcoin is the current superior, most-secure alternative *even in the presence of mining majorities in China.*


Well don't bother. Vitalik posts things that are incorrect and flawed, and nobody notices because they're so complex that following them is impossible for almost all people—but when they are followed, it turns out many of them are in fact completely false, or poor reposts and retranslations of *other peoples' actual work.*
Vitalik's reasoning is flawed for a different reason than yours. In his case, he is describing immeasurable quantities and, for example, he is ignoring the fact that all PoW histories must represent hard work—including the attack forks in Bitcoin-like PoW. Alternate pure-PoS forks in all deployed systems I'm aware of represent virtually zero work—even difficulty of grinding based on CoA-type mechanisms fails, since it is still &gt;0 profitable to grind even mostly-unsuccessfully in such schemes, as far as I can tell. It appears to me you're replacing a well-known and -studied form of grinding with another.


If it costs nothing or next-to-nothing to build alternate chains and release them when you get lucky, or in the event of collusion a majority can effortlessly rewrite history without expending externally-calculable resources equivalent to the original, then there is nothing at stake to preferentially choose one or another fork as canonical.


Whatever mechanism which is not fluid at the level of historical rewrites can be exploited to segment the network especially if it costs little-to-nothing to do so, even if as you imply the histories on already "sync'd" computers are no longer mutable. And even there, whatever properties you're talking about which make such histories immutable, can be exploited to guarantee *future* divergence.


It costs him money and calculable work to force your node to sync to his chain; the amount of global work done is calculable on the head of the canonical chain; the amount of global work likely to have been done is calculable on the head of the canonical chain; there are stronger indicators of canonicity in a PoW system then there are especially in a complicated incalculable-difficulty of stochastic PoS-like systems, and certainly in naive versions such as Dash's broken PoS-like masternode overlay. With Bitcoin, you must not only control the network to feed the node a false, work-laden chain—you must permanently prevent them from learning canonicity thereafter, or it will simply reorg onto the globally canonical.
There are only heuristics to prevent a from-zero chain rebuild in most PoS, or at best explicit corrections that force users to be cognizant and fully aware (i.e. no non-validating nodes) to attach their transactions to some view of what is the current head block.


You are making an equivalence which does not exist. This weak subjectivity you are describing is not analogous between all PoS I'm aware of, and a pure PoW system like Bitcoin.

Just pay the fee and you can get your TX inside of a single block. At the moment it's about $0.40 USD.
@_date: 2016-10-19 23:56:49
This is a lie. It is trivial to estimate a fee which will include a TX within a single block. I know of nobody who paid the estimated X-block fee who didn't then get included within X+small blocks at least, if not sooner.
The average expected times between blocks include 2 hours every couple years, but for 1 hour, it's every two days. Literally every two days you can "expect" to see an inter-block time of an hour.
This is normal, and expected. There is no way around this, it's a crucial effect of randomness.
@_date: 2016-10-28 01:13:50
There's virtually no evidence that Satoshi actually has all those coins people assume he has.
Additionally, *mining* something is different from a *forced reward mechanism*. Continue doing PoW for the network you continue receiving your reward. "Measuring" contribution to the codebase is not actually possible, and besides that, people who just put money into it are the ones being rewarded—who did no work at all except signing over cheques.

No, that's incorrect, because due to unlimited demand, blocks *will likely from now on always be full.*
Therefore, the only thing you need to do is begin spamming with TX which are enough to bump off a portion of the group of immediate TX in your current mempool, and you're done—a large percentage of people still experience "slowdowns."

No, it did not, because I was not asserting that there is a "most likely" outcome of the next halving ETA being unmodified by a naive calculation, or, as in my prior posts, such ETA being anything less than completely incorrect without being informed by knowledge of mining equipment supply, configuration, and market prices of bitcoins.
Retargeting has not been static, and &lt;0.1J/GH machinery is going to be arriving "soon". If it happens before the next halving, as I think it will, the halving ETA will be changed more than just "a day."
And this is what my point is.
Equally valid because the calculations are related are those mining ROI calculators that don't take into account historical and recent hashrate retargets to help people realize that mining is not profitable.
To rephrase again, because unless you are just ignoring my point, rephrasing helps people understand: drastic, exponential hashrate increases are not the exception, but the norm in Bitcoin block generation, and ASIC hardware is *not currently* at its maximum efficiency.

No. That is incorrect.
First, there is no such thing as a currency market cap. Additionally, the percent-of market cap is meaningless, since e.g. the Eth foundation can manipulate price with their crushing number of Eth sitting there doing nothing—but that says nothing about **market depth** or other factors which make one coin or the other a dominating economic force, such as exchange volume or on-chain transaction value estimates. Literally, that stupid measure could be gamed by getting on it, and then selling 0.00000001 "CAPCOIN" for $1000, then issuing a billion of them into circulation..  to myself.
Secondly, they aren't a good testing ground for Bitcoin, since the vast majority of them are pure scamcoin nonsense, and worse, if any money is made on them, someone is always holding the bag at the end of the bubble, which means the profits you're making off a fraudulent coin are ethically tainted with that fraud.

These *sorts of spends* (I don't know how Counterparty destroyed their bitcoins) are usually theoretically spendable. If we want to count stuff we "know" is lost, we would need to include stuff like, say, ASCII art transaction spam a la Dan Kaminsky's Len Sassaman tribute, and then more loosely, consider a good chunk of bitcoins unspendable where people lost their keys; or the other vanity addresses where we interpret human-readable meaning as a probability for address generation. Some forms of transactions are also "provably" unspendable I'm sure based on the associated P2SH script: these are not included in what I'm talking about. Besides, those don't decrease the "set of bitcoins that have been mined". The rest is just UTXO interpretation right?
Another way to approach this is to add up all coinbase outputs from every block ever mined, and pretend that the duplicate coinbases that were mined were actually part of the set of mined coinbase. But it's still important to know what they are/were/etc.

Because the term "Market Cap" applies to **stocks**. NOT currencies. Stocks most often have recorded owners, and the amounts outstanding are controlled and carefully accounted for.
No such measure exists in Bitcoin.
Neither does it have meaning in the sense that there is something we can usefully derive from it about the economy. There's no indication of circulating coins. There's no market depth. There's no idea of the size of the economy it supports, or the cost of mining, or the changing subsidy over time, or any measure of the hashrate centralization.
If I built an altcoin right now, and made it so scarce that I had absolute control over it; and then sold 0.0001 of it for $500 to someone, the market cap of that coin could trivially exceed everything else on the market. These premine scams especially are trivially manipulated by the people who own the premine.
So what have I shown with a coin that had literally a single transaction to it in its history but whose so-called "market cap" just beat Bitcoin?
Absolutely nothing. It's meaningless.

Hilarious. So..  he fabricated a massive lying tax dodge with a fake supercomputer, he fabricated a whole bunch of stuff on his CV that has no basis in reality, he fabricated degrees, and lots of other things, with the eventual aim of being able to protect himself from being outed to the world as Satoshi—while still taking enormous funds from people and claiming he is Satoshi—but only those people who aren't technically savvy enough to know any better to begin with—and continuing to advertise himself as Satoshi to acquire more funding, while hiding from the authorities for the fraud he'd committed in the first place, and oh, by the way, falsifying a pile of patents, and permanently altering his writing style to that of a 5th-grade dropout.
In other words, everybody who thinks that lying to the ATO is a tax-dodge is a "super-smart genius" that he planned to fool for five years.

That person has an in-depth knowledge of a shill-related Hashfast court case and uses it to lie about what happened in a way which can only be directly disproved by accessing the court documents themselves via PACER. This is from an argument I personally had with him here on Reddit.
There's something wrong with his brain, and he uses his otherwise reasonably high intelligence to build a reality for himself contrary to fact that he seems to either actually believe in, or acts 100% consistently as though he believes in it.
Beware of that one. He has made indirect but not-so-veiled threats on the safety of people who are smarter than he is and who win arguments against him in ways which are logically incontrovertible.

Since there is no way for a user to prove that money was stolen from them, the guarantee is pointless. The publisher can trivially just say, "Must've been at your end," and there's nothing the user can say differently.
This is basically the essence of centralization: why would a user trust that neither you, nor the book publisher, haven't simply kept the privkey for later exploit given that it is impossible to prove an error in a closed-source, closed-process publisher, when they can generate their own keys using widely-audited software like Bitcoin Core and achieve superior, safer results?
Besides, I would be willing to bet money that whoever the ISO auditor(s) is(are), they are not competent to validate cryptographic protocol, nor bitcoin-related code, nor random number generators used in ec signing.

Your point otherwise, though, is completely accurate. Even if they all do go away, there exist devs who could otherwise fill the void--even if temporarily--and keep the system going, much like any other project out there that's achieved developer immortality.

Incorrect. Falsified evidence makes it *less* likely to be true, in that the deliberate falsification of evidence, the lying, and cheating, is *positive evidence he is a conman trying to steal money.* That is a logical contradiction, which is equally as valid as disproof of the hypothesis that he is Satoshi.
Contrary to the notion people try to handcuff themselves, falsification (now I mean it not in the sense of forgery but of evidentiary falsification) of a theory is in fact possible—just as much as a contradiction can be used to prove something.

I have not. The retargeting is done with granularity of two weeks. Reality does not happen on a granularity of two weeks; therefore, for some periods where hashrate has been added to the system, for that period, it will be shorter by the amount that the retarget adjusts hashrate. It is not so that the retargeting has been static in the last few months. As you can visually see here with your own eyeballs:
We've had three retargets within the last month which decreased the retarget *periods* between those retargets by the same amount as the retarget. (Which I guess is stating the obvious since that's the definition of a retarget, modulo incorrect timestamps in blocks, which do happen.)

You can get a better estimate of the reward halving if you calculate it yourself.
COUNT=$( bitcoin-cli getblockcount ); echo "scale=0;((${COUNT}-(${COUNT}%210000)+210000)-${COUNT})/2016 * 2 * 7"|bc -l
Build the number of blocks to the next halving, divide it by 2016 (which is the two-week retarget period), multiply by 2 weeks per retarget, multiplied by 7 days per week.
This is a rough calculation based on the difficulty remaining completely constant the entire time—which is absurd of course. That's why we modify it by an estimate of hashrate, which nobody seems to be doing.
Anyway the naive result is currently 280 days.
We could wave our hands, and perhaps an overall climb of 5-10% is coming, in which case we get between 273 and 266 days, which places us between Jul 17 and Jul 10, 2016.
To calculate the current number of Bitcoins mined, you have to query Bitcoin itself to find out the current value of "impossible-to-spend" Bitcoins. From there you can work out how many Bitcoins have been destroyed *plus* how many have actually come into existence, but you have to know the history of Bitcoin or the number won't make any sense.
The current theoretical maximum number of Bitcoins that *could* have come into existence assuming perfect mining is:
(210000 - 1) * 50 + (379433-210000+1) * 25 = 14735800
But what do we see from Bitcoind?
bitcoin-cli gettxoutsetinfo returns:
14735686.14789693 as the total possible spendable Bitcoins, for a difference of:
14735800 - 14735686.14789693 = 113.85210307
What makes up this discrepency? A significant amount of bloat in terms of Bitcoin-provably destroyed coins (which includes people stuffing it with graffiti-I-mean-proofs-of-existence,) one Satoshi from an early block where I underpaid myself by one Satoshi (0.00000001) and also destroyed some fees so the reward would equal 49.99999999 exactly; and two blocks of 50 BTC each as a result of a duplicated coinbase bugfix.
So about 13.85210307 BTC (as of right now) mostly destroyed, and 0.00000001 of it which never actually came into existence in the first place.
I dunno if I'm making a mistake. With the OP_RETURN spam it's not nearly so easy to discern which of those coins are what anymore.

For example, take a look at the thread about Gavin's absolutely bizarre randomness checker. Even the fact that it exists is laughable. And yet, we have people like this:
That's quite an impressive self-delusion going on there.
Or, how about the pernicious, and scumbaggy lie that gmax "stole" credit as it was presented on the Github website, while simultaneously none of them said a single word about the fact that Seracen *stole it again literally while I was arguing with them about it.*

He had commit bits. That doesn't mean he was "made" gatekeeper. As far as I know the only thing we have which claims this is a comment about "good hands" by Hearn. Or Gavin. Same thing. Point is, as far as I know Satoshi never made a public announcement about it. He just left.
Now tell me again how this is revisionist history? I would say what you're describing is more of a rewrite, since terms like "gate keeper" were never used, as far as I know.
The Sourceforge repository was Satoshi's. The Github repository came later, and was imported by..  (edit) Gavin, as it turns out. And the first check-in after the last git-svn-id was Gavin. So, unless you have specific evidence or knowledge of Satoshi himself *starting* the Github repo, then wtf are you talking about.

Nobody bothered to ask who was paying for it all, or why TomZ's commits only ever happen during the weekdays. People don't.. dig for answers. They want them wrapped up in nice soundbite chunks, and when the media is happy to post hit-pieces on individuals or in this case, everyone's favourite punching bag Bitcoin (zomg terrorists!) then the message people get is primarily negative.
Lots of people have proposed forks. Even well-known cryptographer types. Nothing ever gains traction except the stuff Gavin got behind because Gavin himself was the annointed he-with-the-Satoshi-halo. Years and years of everybody being told he was one of the first to work on the codebase after Satoshi left is ingrained in peoples' minds, and it takes a long, long time to correct that with the fact that he hasn't done much of anything for sometimes a year at a time. (And sirius_m was also one of the first but he didn't visit the CIA and start big media blitzes. sirius just faded away and disappeared into the background noise.)
I really do think he wanted to take the Foundation salary and put himself out to pasture. His interview comments are pretty clear -- he wants to look into things he finds interesting. He doesn't want to be a Linus. But the mismanagement at the Foundation dried that salary up in no time.

ASICMiner's original premise was to sell equipment to their investors after supplementing their investment income (for the purpose of dividend payments) by mining a specific, and stated, maximum amount of hashrate. They almost immediately broke more than five times that initial maximum, and the only consolation for investors was that the *original* investors were paid more in bitcoins than they bought ASICMiner 'shares' for on the now-defunct GLBSE.
The hardware was not tradeable for ASICMiner 'shares' as was originally promised. The hardware was not generally available until much later than promised. And by the time it was generally available, it was available to *everyone,* which meant for the most part that the investors were treated completely identically to the public at large in return for taking the risk of investing in a new ASIC company to begin with.
.. and meanwhile, the stated maximum hashrate they promised they would never exceed, was rapidly exceeded, which meant that purchasing their equipment was much closer to a losing proposition than it would have been had they actually adhered to their own business plan and promises to investors.
It was, in my opinion, a fraudulent business almost from the start.

Yes. Do not run any antivirus on your Windows machine. This is almost certainly the cause of your problems with Bitcoin. AntiVirus hooks into the fs layer and there is *literally no way* for Bitcoin, or any other daemon that makes heavy use of on-disk database structures, to protect themselves or cooperatively work with any known AV tool I'm aware of.
Even "turning off" AV for realtime virus detection does not actually do that: the hooks are *always* still there, and will *always* fire. The AV pretends to be shut off but the hooks still interfere with fs activity.
There *IS NO* way to fix this on Windows. There *IS NOTHING* the Bitcoin core devs can do to work around this. There *IS NO WAY* for Bitcoin *or any other database layer that sees heavy activity,* to operate without crashes, bugs, and corruption, on a Windows machine running AV.

I would say it is superior advice to tell people to run their Windows machine behind a stateful non-Windows firewall, never click links, never download or run software, never plug any devices into their Windows USB ports (or any other ports for that matter,) don't use Microsoft Office, or any other non-default software that came with the operating system, etc etc. Then you can run a wallet on Windows.
But this is completely unrealistic, so I just suggest people not run Bitcoin Core on a Windows machine at all, exactly for these reasons: the only people you can convince to operate their computer in this way are people who are willing to behave like ascetic monks while online.
So, realistically, I don't know that there is a solution right now for a Windows user except, "Don't store more than a bitcoin or two in a hot-wallet-like environment on your Windows machine, and make regular backups."

There is no such thing as a Bitcoin market cap. It is a meaningless product between two numbers that, combined, tell us virtually **nothing** about it.


The companies wouldn't exist without their users creating cash flow. The blockchain wouldn't exist without the users pumping their money into it. The miners wouldn't get paid without the users' money buying the new coins. The system would fail; the economy would crash.
Companies **don't use Bitcoin in their day-to-day operations.** They don't know how to report the taxes. They don't know how to integrate the finances. They almost universally don't run nodes.
Your assertions are baldly **FALSE**.

That sort of extortionate selfish behaviour deserves more respect, does it?
And what he's doing now? Working to a spec which is inviolate, accepts no outside input, and is being built specifically to interfere with work other people did, even though the suggestions have offered easy, simple ways for the various proposals—and crucially, the sub-components of these proposals—to coexist normally?

Paypal's own page states "9.3 million payments every day" which is:
9300000/(24 * 60 * 60)=107.63
In December, or one month *after* that page was updated, Paypal said 9.7 million:
9700000/(24 * 60 * 60)=112.26

Aside from the fact that "scaling on-chain" is untenable unless you are okay with limiting nodes to datacentres and $20k machines, the utility to users is obvious: off-chain channels can provide forms of privacy that do not currently exist; and unlimited off-chain, as-safe-as-Bitcoin transactions and interactions that require no exchange as mediator is a powerful scaling mechanism.

Why store them at all? A /24 narrows it to a (probable) single SWIP'd CIDR allocation; or reduces possible users down to a maximum of 254 (or 253.) Of 253 people, it is not hard to deduce which is most likely to be the one who downloaded the software.
If there needs to be some aggregation because you're interested in countries, get a geoiplookup and increment counters.
But it's not cool that you're storing the logs. :(
In the typical Apache logs, we also have fingerprintable browser information, timing information, referer URLs, Javascript execution (or not) and other details which would be invaluable if someone came knocking on a fishing expedition.
You're also creating a significant target for subpoenas: the actual source of downloads is recording a (mildly obfuscated) log of connecting IP addresses. And now they know you keep it.

If anyone but the user is generating the key, the idea is invalid: your customers have to trust that you aren't going to rip them off, that your printing company isn't going to rip them off, and that anyone with possession of the paper doesn't rip them off on its way into their own hands. There *is* no way to do this in trust-free fashion without just letting the user print such things out themselves and sending the money to the pubkey they send to you.
The method by which the keys are generated is probably not secure; you can assert that the secure printing company is doing it right, but who audits them? Are there even people who exist who are willing to audit such a company for its keygen practices who are also cost-effective?
From the perspective of someone using Bitcoin, trusting you, or trusting your 'secure printing company' is completely identical. How is a user supposed to be confident that the paper they get is even from the secure printing company? The chances of a user verifying for themselves that this secure printing company is the origin of the printout are about as significant as a user verifying that the company is in fact a 'secure printing company.'
What about the secrecy of the private keys going forward? How does a user know one way or another whether manufacturing processes are clean and perfect ongoing?
The Bitcoin Core software, or a reputable *local, native* wallet key generation mechanism is the same, verifiable code that is running on tens, or hundreds of thousands of machines. Literally everyone in that case is their own 'secure printing company' from the perspective of user trust.
In your case, they might as well just get a bank to store their bitcoins for them. They might as well just get an exchange to.
This is a pretty crushingly bad idea. Please rethink it and consider developing another clean, audited way for users to build their own paper wallets.

That academic study assumes that the known clusters are proportionally representative of the unknown clusters, in the complete absence of any reason to do so. It also ignores coinjoin for the most part as a confounder.
Additionally, when the study asserts things like this: "This may suggest that black market sellers explicitly place round
lot prices on their items as a matter of doing business." when the actual data from the DNMs is available to anyone doing a simple scrape, this shows this study is sloppy.
Earlier studies were more accurate, and measured actual DNM activity using e.g. SR1 court records. At that time, when SR1 was singularly alone, and Bitcoin was at its weakest, even if you pretend that on-chain activity was the only activity and wasn't dwarfed by exchange activity at the time, SR1 revenue was a tiny fraction of the whole, **even if** you pretend that 50% of the total number of Bitcoins moving on-chain were just change.
Therefore, this study is suspect.
In any event, the collapse of a single DNM does not mean the entirety of that aspect of the economy is simply gone. Other DNM exist also, and many are still active.
I will also state that your correlation does not fit, and neither does this study indicate that the recent DNM kill of e.g. AlphaBay was responsible for the drop in TX activity. The timing is off, first, and second, the paper is from 2016. And appears to make flawed assumptions.

The hardware is directly owned by me: I don't think a memory upgrade is possible at this point. It's older-ish machinery really and there is only a few GB RAM on it. Each individual VM (in a KVM-run instance) wasn't enough to support a full node, and had to be reconfigured into a consolidated single node. BlueMatt's patches are running on it now, and that has helped considerably, but they used to be mostly-separate instances with different purposes and different connectivity. It's no longer doing that, and I (for now) am focusing on only one network for that machine now. Randomized, multi-minute waits for incoming transaction propagation could probably serve for the purposes I originally had in mind, but I have too much other interesting stuff to do.

You want me to stop being a dick, make a plain answer instead of making comments about the presumed ignorance of the people you're talking to. *YOU*'re the one who thought lettuce was low-water.
Besides, am I supposed to be expected to watch the whole story for unrelated comments, while you're in here playing silly word games with me?
I finally found you saying:


Buttercrunch requires moist soil throughout the growing season—high water.
Baby oakleaf requires medium but consistent watering.
Little gem requires constantly moist soil.
Lunix is just red oak leaf: moist soil.
Outrageous: also requires moist soil throughout the growing season.
What the heck, dude, these aren't "mostly" low-water varieties?! What the heck do you think is high-water?!

Before you consider a verification failed, trace the method NetBSD pkgsrc is using to pull the files and compare checksums: you should be able to recreate these steps yourself to satisfy yourself that the contents are okay.
In any event, this is one of the methods by which pkgsrc retrieves software from github—it understands git tags and can pull files using those tags from github. This is better when used with an actual commitid; it is less helpful when using a tag.
NetBSD shouldn't use the actual signed binary releases because not all NetBSD kernels have Linux emulation built-in, and in any event it is "safer" to build from source anyway due in part to the wildly differing potentially-installed libraries and headers.
However, the more correct thing to do is pull the actual release tarballs instead of grabbing the auto-gen'd Github tarballs. The gitian builders in part sign the *source* distribution tarballs, which are created in a deterministic fashion. For example, here's the SHA2 sums for the various 0.14.2 release files:
1ac4e5ce51ac03c41df0ad1e759dbb55d91e1456b9a616e43344bf2258dbe8ca  bitcoin-0.14.2.tar.gz
And you can double-check that the *source tarball* is the same one we're creating when we gitian build something by plucking out some of the gitian signatures... like say mine:
1ac4e5ce51ac03c41df0ad1e759dbb55d91e1456b9a616e43344bf2258dbe8ca  src/bitcoin-0.14.2.tar.gz
Then, ideally, you grab everyone else's sums from the same gitian.sigs results folder, and verify *everyone* thinks the source tarball for 0.14.2 (or whatever) is the same, and once you verify this, you'll see that the source tarball's sum is identical and can be more-safely imported as a source tarball for use in pkgsrc. And for the love of god, please actually verify the signatures and don't just trust the github results.
The pkgsrc entry **should** conform to the source tarball from the gitian release process, and in any event the sums file can be retrieved from the (currently canonical) bitcoin.org website.

No. This is a pernicious lie that the r\btc FUD'ers repeat often, probably because I decided to pick on this lie to debunk out of a long list of them to prove that users such as ydtm stubbornly and stupidly refuse to update their opinion in the face of superior logic and simple historical fact, and to prove that facts mean nothing to them. I have been debunking this ever since it was posted, as a reminder that the users spreading lies aren't interested in anything but discovering what FUD sticks, and what lying scummy FUD doesn't.
The git repository itself, comprised of a SHA1 hashed history, could only be altered in the event nullc created a SHA1 collision. And in that case, everyone would have noticed. In other words, the git repository **itself** was completely static the entire time. But, in terms of this tired old lie that gets trotted out by people with axes to grind, I can just as easily copy and paste my debunking of same in here.
It is, after all, a straight-up lie regarding the self-assignment of credit. I explicitly, completely, and unreservedly debunked that scummy lie **in its totality.** Even "respected" posters in r\btc (including Gavin Andresen) have said that people repeating varying forms of that lie are making fools of themselves.
Here it is, yet again, since people keep repeating it over and over and I was a part of the original conversation where gmax announced he reproduced the Github bug.
How do I know gmax wasn't stealing credit? I was a part of the actual conversation where he reproduced the Github bug and publically stated he reproduced the bug in the main development discussion channel on Freenode in front of *literally hundreds* of witnesses, and *logged publically and permanently on a search-engine-indexed website.* He was not claiming and never did claim that he did those commits. Neither did the other participants of the conversation think so.
Github subsequently fixed the bug after gmax himself reported it to them.
gmax never said nor implied he wrote those early bitcoin commits. gmax never claimed to have been the one to write them. In no messages about this did he ever claim that sirius_m's commits, nor gavin's commits were in actuality his, and in no messages that anyone has quoted, and no messages in anyone's linked stories, has anyone ever offered any evidence that gmax attempted to claim credit for those commits—in fact, as written, the evidence indicates **exactly the opposite!**
I have been posting this debunking forever, repetitively, over and over. *Nobody* making this claim has literally posted any evidence. It's manufactured in its totality. It is a lie. It is being repeated probably because people think I am gmax and that it therefore means something to him because I spent some time debunking this. In reality I just picked literally a single lie in a laundry list of lies in an ancient post to demonstrate that the original poster (a pernicious liar named ydtm) of these sorts of lies and the propagation thereof was literally just making stuff up, and knew he was making stuff up. I was right, because he never corrected himself and never updated his stupid opinion.
Even all the r\btc self-references to this lie are identical in nature. They use peoples' commentary over a long period of time and then claim that is proof; however, it is not proof, it is recursive, self-referential, and invalid—and if you do in fact follow the self-cites backwards, you come up with piles of dead-ends. **It's a manufactured lie.**
There is no "stolen" misattribution. gmax explicitly told everyone what he was doing when he did it. In front of hundreds of witnesses and a permanent Google'able log.
Nothing anyone has ever said contradicts anything I have asserted about this, ever; nor is basically any of the evidence even verifiable by most of anyone because of the way dishonest people present this lie—which is pretty much entirely uncited. Luckily, *I was actually there and part of the conversation.* Yay me. So I was able to find a log without any difficulty.
In fact, if you *actually read the logs* you find that someone else in fact *did* steal commits—a fact of which nobody including the poster of this story seems to care about.
    [gmaxwell] looks like github may be compromised or badly broken: 
gmaxwell was reproducing the github bug which we were all attempting to investigate and theorize about.
    &lt;gmaxwell&gt; yea, okay. I reproduced the stupidity.
    &lt;gmaxwell&gt; in any case, I went and reserved all the other dotless names in the history. .. looks like it only lets a single github user claim them, first come first serve.
This isn't stealing someone else's credit; this is reproducing a bug in response to *someone else* stealing credit—he was stating categorically and on the record that the commits weren't his own, and that he was doing something to correct an actual misattribution by reporting it to Github.
For people who insist that Luke thought the the Github bug was a problem, Luke himself stated:
    &lt; luke-jr&gt; if I cared, I'd have brought it up on my own when I first noticed it (as mentioned in the logs, months earlier than then)
For people who think it was some kind of investor rip-off scheme (in the complete and total absence of any evidence whatsoever—literally zero,) gmax has said that no investments were ongoing, nor would investors be looking at 2009 github history and being confused about naming bugs. This is explicit and reasonable counter-evidence and literally the only evidence at all one way or the other about the matter anyway.
For people who keep claiming that gmax re-attributed *Satoshi* commit identifiers—this is also false. Assuming you think a *Github* bug is somehow canonical attribution (and actual code-understanding developers don't—because they're not idiots and they know how git works without making wild stupid claims that are trivially false) in reality the github user *saracen* was the one who re-attributed those.
So, the github user "saracen" originally actually did steal credit. gmax stopped him from stealing more credit; gmax told hundreds of witnesses and a permanent, Google'able record about it; gmax reported the bug; Github fixed the bug. Github no longer lists gmax *nor saracen* as authors of (as far as anyone can tell) any early commits via the stupid broken Github interface. Seracan did end up trying to steal more credit. Seracen failed.
Since you can make up whatever you want in terms of a narrative, there is literally nothing that gmax could have done to avoid this absurd and pointless attack on his reputation, since by merely taking action to fix the bug and report it to Github, he opened himself up to literally this entire history's narrative—since it relies on **literally zero actual evidence whatsoever** and instead **entirely on absurd, moronic, idiotic, and entirely laughable claims by people who think this issue matters to anyone who understands code.**
Let me make myself clear: literally nobody who understands how Git works (a DAG of SHA1 hashes) could or would think that the Git commit history was tampered with whatsoever, nor does anyone make any bones of this **Github bug** bug **except stupid and ignorant, dishonest people**.
There *is no appearance of impropriety* except to nonsense conspiracy theorists, since literally everything anyone does could be negatively interpreted if people are willing to lie about it, *no matter what the action is about and in the face of massive evidence to the contrary.*
Debunked. Again. I will continue reposting this, since it costs me nothing to copy and paste, **until the end of time.** ∎

No, they are often posting *actionable libel, criminal harassment and uttering threats, FUD, and simply direct, whole-cloth lies.*
Criminal harassment, actionable libel, and specific threats are, indeed, evil. They aren't opinions.
People *use* the existence of Reddit stories *explicitly to find a reason to perform additional criminal acts.* They appear to believe that *multiple stories reinforcing their biases also provides social consensus and agreement.*
This provides the *impetus they are looking for to act,* which IMO is a mob mentality brokenness: nevertheless, however broken it is, it happens. I have *personally* watched it happen. People work themselves up, find Reddit stories to bolster their courage, and then act criminally. I have logs. I watch it unfold.

It is valid to use a comma in this case because it is a rhetorical delineation of an actual spoken-aloud conversational pause. That is, I intend for the reader to mentally pause prior to reading the term "tenet." If someone were to read the comment aloud, I explicitly want them to pause prior to announcing the word itself. It also functions as a memory aid to write it thusly.
Why you didn't mention the lack of capitalization in the first fragment, I haven't the foggiest clue. In any event, it should have been obvious that I am indirectly quoting actual speech as rhetorical and (in a sense) poetic device. That is, by correcting the incorrect *word itself,* I am correcting it to match the *intended meaning*; whereas were I to pedantically correct it to also be perfect grammatically, I would be creating a needless roadblock to effective communication.
He could conceivably be misinterpreted, underestimated, and misjudged by people if the word he continued to accidentally use in place of the word "tenets" was "tenants." On the other hand, since punctuation is difficult to get right in even the easiest of cases, I will only correct punctuation when someone genuinely wants to learn how to use it correctly, or when it actually destroys the meaning the writer intended to convey. (Or, I suppose, when I'm trying to be a jerk and not actually hoping to save my fellow human from future embarrassment.)

There no such thing as a blockchain that isn't always full unless miners limit it in some fashion or other. Either the blocksize itself limits transactions, or miners themselves limit their emitted blocksizes.

It is actively censored (in their vocabulary) by armies of downvoting bots who hide inconvenient subthreads that disagree with the political agenda of attempting to attack and commandeer bitcoin development for the purposes of pumping the price higher at any cost.
There are large numbers of users who post *actionable libel* who never correct their insipid lies even after individual of them are **completely and utterly debunked.**
Roger Ver encourages violent and criminal attacks on people he defines as "guilty".
People (like pagex) aren't banned from r\btc who post **physical threats directly against core developers.** Bizarrely enough, Reddit themselves seem to refuse to ban users who **post physical threats against core developers.**
Long diatribes of r\btc posts self-link back to themselves, or to other libellous r\btc posts from other users that are filled with self-referential and totally unsubstantiated **lies** in an attempt to trick people into thinking they are *cited when they aren't.* These stories are highly upvoted and accrue virtually zero dissent, proving that it is a strong echo-chamber.
People (including doctors) post vague threats about legal and physical retaliation for perceived slights. Medical researchers post animated gifs about their political opponents (from whom they plagiarized) getting crushed to death.
Accounts that were outed as Craig Wright socks (used to?) constantly post attack pieces against the people who outed him as an advance-fee fraudster and tax-evader, which were regularly upvoted.
Some people even get banned for asking why they have maximum-post limits.
They say they don't censor anything over there, but then when Roger Ver blindly posts images about the automod log, and then the automod rules themselves, we see that they do in fact censor people by offloading the censorship onto their downvoting bot brigades (anyone with less than X karma is mostly automodded out of the sub.) We see specific keywords which earn instant moderation but have absolutely no rationale for it. How is that not the *exact same sort of "censorship" they themselves stated they didn't have?*
Instead of acknowledging that they *do in fact censor by their own definition* we instead see a redirection demanding the same sort of "transparency" from r\bitcoin.
So they go from being "uncensored" to being implicitly "sort of censored but surely less than r\bitcoin."
We have people who post long libellous diatribes calling others who complain about the criminal threats on r\btc "delicate flowers" for not being willing to tolerate criminal acts just for the sake of being their opponents. We get zero opposition to criminal acts including threats of criminal action, conspiracy, and accessory. In other words, they **tolerate and encourage** criminal action against their *political opponents.*
In reality the "uncensored" r\btc is a **hostile agenda**-serving subreddit that encourages illegal methods to achieve their end-goals and takes **very little responsibility for dealing with any of it** *except for the egregiously specific threats that they calculate could make Reddit themselves ban the subreddit.* In other words, it **is self-preservation and not ethics which forces them to act to ban users.**
**EDIT:** Note that there **are** in fact mods there who want to improve r\btc. There are good people trying to do their best in a difficult situation, and I appreciate they are doing that.

In fact many miners have accidentally thrown away piles and piles of fees; some miners deliberately mined duplicate coinbases (which now can't ever be spent); genesis has a hard-coded spending restriction; and if you want to get upset about something, talk to those who are provably destroying bitcoins to "create" altcoins; talk to the people who are deliberately destroying pieces of bitcoin *to spam grafitti into the blockchain via OP_RETURN*.
Reducing my reward by 0.00000001 (and throwing away fees) is a tiny, insignificant result compared to what happens every day. And, since those coins are *provably gone in my case* all of the rest of the coins are worth more as a result: they were mine to destroy, just as the paper fiat in my wallet is.

You only think this because you don't understand the nature of a git repository. The git repository could only be altered in the event nullc created a SHA1 collision. And in that case, everyone would have noticed. In other words, the git repository was completely static the entire time. But, in terms of this tired old lie, that gets trotted out by people with axes to grind (in other words, people like you,) I wrote a complete debunking that I'm just going to copy and paste in here.
I have debunked that lie completely and utterly. But, since you repeated it again completely without any reason to except to be dishonest, I will repost my debunking.
That is a straight-up lie regarding the self-assignment of credit. I explicitly, completely, and unreservedly debunked that lie in its totality. Even respected posters in r\btc (including Gavin Andresen) have said in that people repeating varying forms of that lie are making fools of themselves.
Here is another reproduction of the debunking, since people keep repeating it over and over again and I was a part of the original conversation where gmax announced he reproduced the Github bug.
Also, you don't know what the word "misattribute" means.
How do I know gmax wasn't stealing credit? I was a part of the actual conversation where he reproduced the Github bug and publically stated he reproduced the bug in the main development discussion channel on Freenode in front of *literally hundreds* of witnesses, and *logged publically and permanently on a search-engine-indexed website.* He was not claiming and never did claim that he did those commits. Neither did the other participants of the conversation think so.
Github subsequently fixed the bug after gmax himself reported it to them.
gmax never said nor implied he wrote those early bitcoin commits. gmax never claimed to have been the one to write them. In no messages about this did he ever claim that sirius_m's commits were in actuality his, and in no messages that anyone has quoted, and no messages in anyone's linked stories, has anyone ever offered any evidence that gmax attempted to claim credit for those commits—in fact, as written, the evidence indicates exactly the opposite!
I have been posting this debunking for months now, repetitively, over and over. *Nobody* making this claim has literally posted any evidence. It's manufactured in its totality. It is a lie. It is being repeated probably because people think I am gmax and I spent some time debunking this. In reality I just picked literally a single lie in a laundry list of lies in an ancient post to demonstrate that the original poster of these sorts of lies and the propagation thereof was literally just making stuff up, and knew he was making stuff up. I was right, because he never corrected himself.
Even all the r\btc self-references to this story are identical in nature. They use peoples' commentary over a long period of time and then claim that is proof; however, it is not proof, it is recursive, self-referential, and invalid—and if you do in fact follow the self-cites backwards, you come up with piles of dead-ends. It's a manufactured lie.
There is no "stolen" misattribution. gmax explicitly told everyone what he was doing when he did it. In front of hundreds of witnesses and a permanent Google'able log.
Nothing anyone has said so far contradicts anything I have asserted about this, ever; nor is most of the evidence even verifiable by most of anyone because of the way dishonest people present this lie—pretty much entirely uncited. Luckily, *I was actually there and part of the conversation.* Yay me. So I was able to find a log without any difficulty.
In fact, if you *actually read the logs* you find that someone else in fact *did* steal commits—a fact of which nobody including the poster of this story seems to care about.
    [gmaxwell] looks like github may be compromised or badly broken: 
gmaxwell was reproducing the github bug which we were all attempting to investigate and theorize about.
    &lt;gmaxwell&gt; yea, okay. I reproduced the stupidity.
    &lt;gmaxwell&gt; in any case, I went and reserved all the other dotless names in the history. .. looks like it only lets a single github user claim them, first come first serve.
This isn't stealing someone else's credit; this is reproducing a bug in response to *someone else* stealing credit—he was stating categorically and on the record that the commits weren't his own, and that he was doing something to correct an actual misattribution by reporting it to Github.
For people who insist that Luke thought the the Github bug was a problem, Luke himself stated:
    &lt; luke-jr&gt; if I cared, I'd have brought it up on my own when I first noticed it (as mentioned in the logs, months earlier than then)
For people who think it was some kind of investor rip-off scheme (in the complete and total absence of any evidence whatsoever—literally zero,) gmax has said that no investments were ongoing, nor would investors be looking at 2009 github history and being confused about naming bugs. This is explicit and reasonable counter-evidence and literally the only evidence at all one way or the other about the matter.
For people who keep claiming that gmax re-attributed *Satoshi* commit identifiers—this is also false. Assuming you think a *Github* bug is somehow canonical attribution (and developers don't—they know how to use git) in reality saracen was the one who re-attributed those.
The github user "saracen" originally actually did steal credit. gmax stopped him from stealing more credit; gmax told hundreds of witnesses and a permanent, Google'able record about it; gmax reported the bug; Github fixed the bug. Github no longer lists gmax *or saracen* as authors of (as far as anyone can tell) any early commits.
Since you can make up whatever you want in terms of a narrative, there is literally nothing that gmax could have done to avoid this absurd and pointless attack on his reputation, since by merely taking action to fix the bug and report it to Github, he opened himself up to literally this entire history's narrative—since it relies on **literally zero actual evidence whatsoever** and instead **entirely on absurd claims by people like yourself who think this issue matters to anyone who understands code.**
Let me make myself clear: literally nobody who understands how Git works (a DAG of SHA1 hashes) could or would think that the Git commit history was tampered with whatsoever, nor does anyone make any bones of this bugfix **except dishonest people like you**.
Let me show you what you're doing, and in the same vein: You've just shown *you don't understand any of this* which means you and people like you aren't actually interested in the truth, but instead in wasting peoples' time with your absurd notions of how capable people *should* fix bugs, and how they *should* spend their time. There *is no appearance of impropriety* except to nonsense conspiracy theorists like yourself, since literally everything anyone does could be negatively interpreted if you are willing to lie about it, *no matter what the action is about and in the face of massive evidence to the contrary.*
Debunked. Again. ∎

They don't seem to be explaining whether accounts with current withdrawal limits greater than $10k will retain those limits going forward past the "unlimited deposit" cut-off date.
Given the fairly extreme nature of this change (you can deposit $140k but to get it back out will take two weeks,) and the fact that it applies even to virtual currencies, as a capital control mechanism I would expect them at this point to start fielding questions of solvency.
When was the last time their bitcoin solvency was audited, anyway?
They say you can apply for higher withdrawal limits, and the $10k limits won't be in place until.. Aug 1, I think? But at the same time, why wouldn't you be allowed to take delivery of.. say.. $50k of gold coins entirely at your own convenience instead of theirs?
And for those people comparing this to a traditional bank, do American banks actually prevent their customers from withdrawing *their own money*? I know of no bank up here (Canada) that would prevent you from completely emptying your account no matter how much money was in it, limited only by available physical cash on-hand if you wanted some sacks full of it and security implications/liability.
It's quite a bit more stringent than a normal bank, at least for some sane value of "normal".
What about cashier's cheque? Wire transfer? The whole *point* of Bitcoin was to help us retain sovereignty over our own money. What's an American supposed to do? Meet shady weirdos in Starbucks and hope it's not some kind of LE laundering sting?

The  channel on Freenode is "officially unlogged." That means we officially don't publish the logs anywhere, and if we find that logs are published somewhere, we ask that they be taken down. Freenode policy for "officially" unlogged channels is described here, along with an example of the reasoning/rationale for why it is the way it is:
We're perfectly aware that anybody can just randomly log if they're sitting there, but basically because it's the front-door for the other (often officially logged)  channels, and newbies often say things in there they regret, we've set the policy to "unlogged," to protect the newer users.
Part of this policy stems from the fact that newbies can often accidentally reveal their wallet contents by posting e.g. addresses in there, or txid that relate to them directly, and this would mean there would be a Google'able database that any rando can use to de-anonymize not only the newbie but anyone they've transacted with (and so on.)
We're completely aware also that it's basically a gentleman's agreement, because honestly a lot of clients just log by default. The gentleman's agreement/request just mostly applies to *publishing* the logs.
The way you can detect whether a channel is "officially" logged or not is to check the topic. Officially logged channels say they are logged right there in the topic.

Who said anything about the "media"? From the convictions:
"Federal prosecutors successfully argued that von NotHaus was, in fact, trying to pass off the silver coins as U.S. currency. Coming in denominations of 5, 10, 20, and 50, the Liberty Dollars also featured a dollar sign, the word "dollar" and the motto "Trust in God," similar to the "In God We Trust" that appears on U.S. coins."
In other words, they managed to convince a whole courtroom that NotHaus was making confusingly similar money *deliberately.*
So..  apparently the people in charge of delivering a verdict were convinced it was confusingly similar. Listing the differences doesn't change much of that.
Most people don't know that you can buy sheets of $2 from the USG and cut them off yourself in pieces to pay for stuff.
So..  when the money has a dollar sign on it, the word "dollar," and a confusingly similar motto, what do you expect *but* confusion from people who can barely tell the difference between actual currency and actual currency?

Yes it does. Only a stupid person could possibly assume everyone is as stupid or stupider than he is. That is why he pasted a complex image-based fraudulent "proof". He was baldly asserting he is smarter than everyone because he thought he could build something complex enough that *he* couldn't do better—therefore, *nobody* could do better.
That's stupid egotism, not intelligence.

People don't like talking about DNM because people think talking about them makes them in some way complicit.

Are you kidding? I offered to buy one from someone on IRC for $500 not..  a week ago. The idea is that the coins would be so scarce that it would be impossible for the market to correct for them no matter what, which would mean that the coins circulate forever just between us—an experiment in scarcity.

I did not. I don't care to know you intimately. Too intimate.
You *just said* that you evaluated him over a bunch of years and found him (blah blah.) And I'm saying people like you who see integrity in selfish people are *ripe* for being conned.


Sure I do. You evaluated a selfish individual as a man of integrity, and then bragged about how good you are at reading people.


Almost nobody.. Correct.

No. He's not. Nobody's removed him from the team list yet because he rages when the topic is even broached—probably because he is trading on his name being in that team list and based on his name being in that list, there are lots of stories now cropping up which lie about him being a coredev.
He is a former dev. He hasn't done anything in years.

That was not a hard fork.

You have no information about or even ability to prove, that what I'm saying isn't true, even in the loose sense of knowing what I'm even talking about.
When BitcoinXT was forked, a number of people who "supported" the fork were criminally harassing, threatening, and otherwise stalking a number of people who opposed it. I asked Gavin explicitly to counsel restraint on the illegal behaviour being undertaken *in the name of BitcoinXT* and he mocked my request with an absurd tweet about beer hats directed at nullc.
That's..  pretty cruel.

removed.. removed.. removed..
Presumably this way it's harder to report specific lying posts.
