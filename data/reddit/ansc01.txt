nice frontline FT article:
S&amp;P loses Australia appeal over misleading investors
By Jamie Smyth in SydneyAuthor alerts
Standard &amp; Poors has lost its appeal against a landmark court ruling in Australia, which found the credit rating agency misled investors by giving AAA ratings to toxic financial products that lost almost all their value.
The ruling by the Federal Court of Australia in a case that also involved ABN Amro, which is now owned by Royal Bank of Scotland, paves the way for similar court actions in Europe and elsewhere from investors who lost billions of dollars during the financial crisis.
“On appeal, we would uphold these findings in relation to damages, contributory negligence and apportionment,” said the near 500-page appeal ruling delivered by Judge Peter Jacobson on Friday.
S&amp;P, a unit of McGraw-Hill, originally lost the case in November 2012, when the court issued a scathing ruling that the rating agency was “misleading” and “deceptive” when it awarded a AAA credit rating to a complex debt instrument – constant proportion debt obligation notes (CPDOs), also known as Rembrandt notes.
The judgement was the first time a court found a credit rating agency liable for losses incurred by investors on financial products, which it had erroneously awarded a gilt-edged credit rating. It also said that rating agencies have a duty of care to investors.
The court found that the Rembrandt notes were sold to local councils in Australia on the basis that the AAA rating was based on reasonable grounds, and as the result of an exercise in reasonable care and skill, while neither was true.
“S&amp;P also knew them not to be true when they were made,” concluded the original ruling.
Local councils lost tens of millions of dollars on the collateralised debt instruments when the financial crisis struck.
ABN Amro, which created the toxic products, and Local Government Financial Services, which sold them to councils, also engaged in misleading and deceptive conduct, according to the original court judgement.
The dismissal of the appeal by Judge Jacobson is a setback for S&amp;P, which is fighting multiple legal actions in the US and Europe related to claims it issued misleading credit ratings prior to the 2008 financial crisis.
S&amp;P said it was disappointed by the ruling.
“It’s clear that the law in Australia relating to duty of care is at odds with well-established laws elsewhere, including in the US and Europe,” the rating agency said. “We continue to believe that it is bad policy to enforce a legal duty against a party like S&amp;P, which has no relationship with investors who use rating opinions, yet impose no responsibility on those investors to conduct their own due diligence.”
Bentham IMF, the commercial litigation funder that financed the case against S&amp;P and ABN Amro on behalf of local councils, said the Australian ruling was important for a parallel case that it is funding against both parties in the Netherlands.
“If we had lost today it is likely that the proceedings in the Netherlands would not have continued,” said John Walker, executive director of Bentham IMF.
He said the ruling against S&amp;P made it commercially viable for the company to fund its similar case in Europe.
On Tuesday a US federal judge ruled that cases taken by 16 US states and Washington DC against S&amp;P should be heard in state courts rather than federal courts. Most of these claims were filed in February 2013, when the US Department of Justice sued S&amp;P for $5bn in a California federal court.

Bitcoin is not in anyone's hand. It is an unstoppable revolutionary invention that cannot be banned or regulated out of existence. At best, it can be slowed down, but ultimately it will prevail just like any other breakthrough technology in the history of mankind.

Izabella Kaminska, FT alphaville, Sep 19 2014:
'We’re going to stick our neck out at this stage and call this the end of Bitcoin. The reason being, the positive-feedback loop forces which drove Bitcoin to $1124.76 have now become the same very same which will drive it down to the bottom.
And what are those magnifying forces? Partly the fact that the mechanism that ensures coins cannot be overproduced to benefit from high prices also prevents supply from being contracted when prices/demand collapses.
Partly also the fact that in a race to the bottom it doesn’t pay to switch off your mining machine if you’re the most efficient miner.
So how did we find ourselves on this delusional joy ride to begin with?
Well it’s the same old story of frivolity, irrational exuberance, hysteria and of course the mistaken belief that something like a free lunch is truly possible. (Not to mention the cult’s last great hope being lost, that of Scotland adopting Bitcoin…)
It’s also exactly the sort of irrationality and bad allocation of capital that the Fed is trying to shake-out at this stage with tightening talk.
We’re sure we may still see a few deep pocketed VCs or “believers” throw more money at defending the dream, but chances are we’ve now gone through the exponential break point. Time and money would probably be better spent trying to pump up Bitcoin V.2.'

Bitcoin could be used to hide assets in divorces, warn lawyers
By Jane Croft
Bitcoin, the electronic currency, could be used by divorcing spouses to hide assets from estranged partners, lawyers have said, as court battles shift their focus to the disclosure of assets.
Divorce settlements in England are seen as particularly generous to ex-wives, because judges recognise the equal contributions made by the breadwinner and the homemaker in a marriage, and divide the assets equally.
Moreover, courts are increasingly having to deal with legal battles brought by one side claiming the other has not made full disclosure of assets and has concealed wealth.
Ayesha Vardag, a London divorce lawyer, has warned that more lawyers may start including digital currencies in financial disclosure orders if there is evidence they have been used.
“They can be used to run a parallel economy,” she said. “People will go to immense lengths . . . as a spousal claim is more damaging than tax because it is half your wealth.”
Already, a number of forums devoted to Bitcoin discussion have seen husbands exploring the option of using digital currencies, she said.
Bitcoins provide relative anonymity to investors and, unlike bank accounts and share holdings, they are hard to link to an individual.
For this reason, the currency has become a mainstay of illicit transactions, such as through Silk Road, the now-closed online drugs and weapons marketplace.
Although traditional currency holdings – in US dollars or euros for example – might need to be declared as part of the asset disclosure process, parties could try to hide their wealth by converting it to Bitcoins.
Unscrupulous spouses could also transfer the currency quickly and almost anonymously between online wallets, hiding their wealth in the hands of friends, perhaps outside of the jurisdiction, to avoid discovery and enforcement.
Frank Arndt, head of international family law at Stowe Family Law, said that he expected Bitcoins could become an asset to be disclosed in divorce cases.
“Husbands are becoming more and more creative in terms of what they do to reduce their wealth and the courts are struggling to catch up. It’s just like when the internet started and it was difficult for courts to catch up,” he said.
Husbands are becoming more and more creative in terms of what they do to reduce their wealth and the courts are struggling to catch up. It’s just like when the internet started and it was difficult for courts to catch up.
Steven Philippsohn, a fraud and asset recovery lawyer at PCB Litigation, said he had not seen any cases of people hiding their assets using digital currencies but believed that court orders of asset disclosure might soon include them.
“Court orders in this country are very extensive and it’s inevitable it will happen . . . orders for disclosure have incorporated new areas like Facebook and Twitter,” he said.
Courts in California are beginning to issue search and discovery orders of assets that include digital currencies such as Bitcoin.
Last November, the District Court for the Eastern District of California issued a discovery order in a trademark infringement case involving Entrepreneur Media Inc. It ordered the disclosure of financial statements from the defendant including any use of digital banking services such as Bitcoin.
Ms Vardag said there was no reason a similar disclosure order could not be obtained from the English courts.
Last year, Michelle Young was awarded a £20m lump sum after divorcing her husband Scot Young.
He had claimed he was penniless and could not afford to pay anything. She alleged he was worth millions.
Mr Justice Moor noted that Mr Young was said to be hiding very considerable assets and found he had “misled the court as to his finances to a very significant extent” and failed to disclose assets.
The Supreme Court also ruled last year that Yasmin Prest, the former wife of Michael Prest, an oil trader who was worth £37.5m in 2011, could receive millions of pounds of property assets from three offshore companies, despite the fact they were set up as distinct legal entities by her former husband.

All this excitement about a few weeks of a narrow trading range is downright stupid. It is much too early in bitcoin's lifecycle to declare that we have reached stability. Imho we happen to be in a period of relative calm regarding price and volume, which is to be followed by another uptick in volatility somewhere in the future. This is not a bad thing, and does not reduce its utility as a payment system. Since when are free markets free of volatility?

This is not true. 
You cannot buy something instantly, without fees, except with Bitcoin. 
A bank account carries fees, even if you don't use it. Every time you use it, more fees. It is far from being instant. I have three accounts at the same bank in three different currencies, and moving my own money between those takes at least 3 days.

Soledad Rodríguez Pons admits she had no idea what bitcoin was when it was suggested to her two years ago that the digital currency could provide a neat way of dodging Argentina’s strict capital controls.
“I was suspicious at first,” says the 29-year-old owner of a budget hostel in Buenos Aires.
“But I took the risk, and it was well worth it,” she adds, explaining that she takes credit-card payments from foreign tourists in return for the digital currency. At the moment, she can sell her bitcoins on Argentina’s unofficial currency market for 50 per cent more than she would get at the official exchange rate.
The prolonged use of capital controls in Argentina since 2011 has wreaked havoc for businesses operating in South America’s second-largest economy — not only restricting access to foreign currency and leading to a heavily overvalued official exchange rate, but also exacerbating economic stagnation and double-digit inflation.
Under the leftist government of President Cristina Fernández, no immediate change is expected in Argentina’s complicated economic conditions, which have seen the use of bitcoin more than double over the past year, mainly among small businesses. This represents much faster growth than elsewhere in Latin America, according to bitex.la, a regional bitcoin exchange.
Recent raids on currency trading houses and new powers for the national spy agency to prevent speculative attacks pushed the peso’s black market value this week to its lowest levels since Argentina defaulted last year on its foreign debt for the second time this century.
On a cruise round the Mediterranean, Domingo Cavallo, Argentina’s economy minister in the run-up to the country’s dramatic economic collapse in 2001, was bemused when he was unable to use his credit card during a brief stop-off on Greek soil last week.
However, presidential elections in October are expected to bring in a more market-friendly administration, and investors hope that untangling capital controls will be one of the top priorities for the new government. That has triggered a heated debate over how to defuse a situation that has caused an investment drought in Argentina.
“As always happens with such controls, it is much more complicated getting rid of them than it is putting them in place,” says José Luis Espert, an Argentine economist.
The two leading candidates advocate sharply differing methods. Daniel Scioli, the one-armed governor of Buenos Aires province backed by Ms Fernández, favours a more gradual approach, although there is growing concern that his government ties will limit his room for manoeuvre.
Mauricio Macri, the centre-right mayor of the city of Buenos Aires, backed by the markets, prefers a more immediate solution.
Although Mr Espert also recommends a swift removal of capital controls, he says it must be accompanied by a “technically solid economic plan” that inspires strong confidence in the markets. “Without a credible plan, shock treatment can be just as damaging as a more gradual approach,” he warns.
José Urtubey, vice-president of the Argentine Industrial Union (UIA), a powerful business chamber, doubts that shock therapy will work. Although capital controls played a big part in a 2.6 per cent contraction in Argentina’s industrial sector last year — foreign currency is essential to import materials needed for industrial production — he fears that central bank reserves could not withstand the pressure on the currency generated by the controls’ sudden removal. “The remedy could be worse than the illness,” he says.
As always happens with such controls, it is much more complicated getting rid of them than it is putting them in place
- José Luis Espert, Argentine economist
Such resistance to change explains why Mr Espert believes that Argentina’s volatile economy has for the past half century been stuck in a “vicious triangle”, whose vertices are crisis, followed by a rebound and then mediocrity — which every decade or so leads to another crisis.
“Soon there will be another one,” he says, pointing to a lack of consensus over how to fix the country’s serious macroeconomic imbalances, especially a gaping fiscal deficit, which he fears will lead to more mediocrity. “Argentina finds it very difficult to escape that triangle. We are afflicted by a kind of [economic] Stockholm syndrome,” he says.
If the future of Argentina’s economy is as gloomy as Mr Espert fears, that would be good news for bitcoin, which is still in its infancy in Argentina, with only about 6,000-8,000 users.
Franco Daniel Amati, a co-founder of Bitcoin Argentina, a kind of embassy for bitcoin in the heart of the Buenos Aires financial district, is optimistic about prospects for the digital currency in a country where still only half the population entrust their money to the formal banking system.
“A recurring inflation crisis, capital controls and overall financial repression make life very difficult in Argentina. More and more people here are looking for ways to get around these problems, and bitcoin is the perfect solution,” he says.

The most obvious answer is: cash. Of course, in a crisis environment, trust in banks will suffer, but I doubt that more than a small fraction of safe-haven seekers will dare invest in bitcoin. 
On the other hand, given the orders-of-magnitude differences in market cap, this will still be sufficient to ignite an epic rally in btc.

The most likely outcome to me is that the ECB will retire the debt it buys, not only for Greece but for all Euro member states. This way, everyone would profit, while further shifting the burden on the currency itself.

i can relate- i tried talking to some colleagues at work about bitcoin a few times, but people are just TOO LAZY to research it, and these were relatively smart people. that makes me think it will only truly take off if someone creates a killer app that e.g. makes people use bitcoin without them necessarily being aware of it, as in remittances where it's being exchanged to and from fiat in the background.

imagine the following example: a stock closes the trading day at 100. over night, new information (quarterly results etc) arrives. the next morning, as trading resumes, the first trade takes place at 120. who lost? nobody. the perception of value changed and so everyone who owned the stock profited.

no the whole concept is flawed. the number of buyers and sellers is always equal. must be, logically. the only indication of preference fiat vs. btc is the price, not the amount of coins that are bought and sold simultaneously.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:33:24

@_date: 2013-10-29 16:31:06
yes, fiat is usd (bitstamp is use only) to btc and back. so you wire them e.g. ear, they convert at a competitive rate (about 1% fee that their bank takes), you buy btc, you withdraw the btc to your wallet (this varies from instantly to a 1hr wait)

academics just want to grab a piece of attention they live off it, literally. a paper that would have not come to a sensationalist conclusion (what are the chances that a few guys at any university discover a real threat that nobody has seen before?) wouldn't have gotten them that. i read the paper and have to say i find it pretty naive. what would the incentive for any miner be to destroy the network which earns him a living for a little short-term profit? it just doesn't stand up to basic economic reasoning and scrutiny.

no. trading is not a zero-sum game (except in derivatives, because there is always the same number of long and short positions).
example: you buy 1btc at 200 (someone sells it to you). the market goes to 300 because the perception of value changes. result: you made 100, nobody lost (the person who sold to you just didn't profit).
@_date: 2013-10-29 17:03:03
