Didn't the developers for LN just test it successfully? I don't think it's that far off brother

I loved how he tried to measure dicks in the middle there

Feed them through a mixer and list them for cash on local bitcoins

More and more Im seeing he's just some early adopter who got lucky and not "Bitcoin Jesus". He invested in a bunch of startups? So what? Anyone can just hand people money. He has no programming background which is a red flag in itself. He's just some Fuckboy looking for more control.

Nah come on man I just bought the dip
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:42:11
Whoa is there a link somewhere where I can see this?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:09:51
Wow this is the first I've actually seen Roger Ver talking. The dude sounds like a psychopath.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:52:56
What specifically has he done? All I've seen so far is a bunch of failed attempts to force an entire market in his favor
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:01:14
Oh thank fuck I'm not the only one. I can literally watch those buying walls and selling walls build up and tear down all night.

I was on another site called Abraxas when bitcoin was 300. Back then I thought it was a pain that I had to pay in some weird digital currency and I didn't really even know what it was. Needless to say I have some deep seated regrets.
@_date: 2017-11-07 06:06:47
Damn that's good way to put it in perspective 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:49:16
Either cash it out through localbitcoins or make an online company and incorporate in Delaware so you only have to pay the federal income tax

what I suggest is a light shame butter sauce with a little pinch of told-you-so paste. Dress with a sprig of wrongful ignorance and serve hot with a side of you're-still-poor-but-im-not-anymore cream soup.

Whoa there friend

I predicted that bitcoin would rise back in August when it was 4000. Bought 4.48. Was doing well then China happened and I sold at 3000. Needless to say I have some deep seated regrets.

Fuck exchanges and their fees go on local bitcoins and buy some. They've got options for moneygram and cash mail orders
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:48:33
I mean understand that it solves hashes and put transactions into a block and all that I just don't know how consistently the money comes and all that. Just not a whole lot that has to do with the hardware really
@_date: 2017-10-10 18:21:19
3 is the most interesting I thought that too because all the big signatories involved putting their chips down for the 2x altcoins. Do you really think it's propping it up to that extent or is this mostly still recovery from the drastic price changes from the China fiasco? Or a FOMO/2x fork/recovery combo?
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:58:36
Isn't it still shut down? I don't think China has made formal regulations yet

The IRS audits anyone with one deposit of 10000 or multiple deposits under the span of a year totaling 10000. It would be wiser to send them through a mixer and sell them for cash on localbitcoins if you really want to avoid taxes or litigation.
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:03:01
[it's a trap]( 
@_date: 2017-09-12 00:33:03
I always advocate Localbitcoins. Get people to mail you cash for them at a favorable exchange rate. There is also an option for people to Moneygram you or give you a Walmart2Walmart transfers. All of these are tax free. I personally have never had a problem but watch out when people mail you cash. Get a money counter with counterfeit detection or use one of the other services I listed above.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:57:14
Another thought would be to open and register an online business and a matching business account in Delaware so you only have to pay the fed tax on your profits and not the state tax.

Godamn it I forgot about Gdax. Thanks for the tutorial coulda been using this all along
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:48:45
Stepped away from my coinigy chart for 30 minutes. Come back and the damn thing jumped up $100. HODL my friends. HODL good.
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:09:15
You mean miners right?
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:57:05
Could bitcoin on Coinbase still be at risk even though they are supporting both chains?
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:34:44
It's funny that now that bitcoin is making real price gains the government is showing and interest in taking down Darknet market places. They took down Alphabay and Hansa in July right before the price made serious leaps. Now they've arrested one of the moderators of Dream marketplace. The government doesn't care about anyone's safety or the fentanyl trade. They just want the damn bitcoins.

Wait I'm in LA!!! Where is it?!?
@_date: 2018-07-20 01:34:20
Oh shit I thought it was gonna be San Fran or something that’s a little while away from me
@_date: 2017-09-03 05:09:10
Its funny that Bitcoin is the "currency of crime." This is just government propaganda because the system doesn't want an untaxable currency to exist. Cold cash is actually the currency of crime. I guarantee there are more 5x more cash exchanges for drugs and illicit services than there are for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 05:04:58
Everyone forgets that they actually shut down 2 more darknet exchanges including the biggest one, Alphabay. They've still got many more bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-04-27 16:22:10
All this just makes us look pathetic tbh. We’ve already won here there isn’t any need for this petty garbage
