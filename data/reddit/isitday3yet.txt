Well it appears my Siri is just fucked in the head. Won't give me the price of bitcoin no matter what I ask. Weird.
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:35:59

This. How can anyone possibly believe that when the irc logs, mailing list, git repo etc are all available for everyone to read? Fucking idiots

Are you attesting that everyone involved has good intentions?  Because I'm pretty sure that can be proved definitively to be untrue (and because you know this, a lie).  I have a hard time seeing how "firing core" is a worthy goal/intention.
@_date: 2017-10-03 01:05:16
oh fuck lol

Hey u/evoorhees - wondering if your opinions align with Vinny's? Thanks for your response.

If 50 bucks is a large percentage of his net worth he's got bigger things to worry about.
@_date: 2017-10-03 00:37:00
Sorry man - thought it was an obvious joke. Perhaps I could have more gently suggested that if he's just started looking into it, likely he didn't just purchase 50 bitcoins. Cheers.

Can't emphasize how important it is highly respected people like Nick do this. Can't just call Nick Szabo a toxic troll.

I guess you can reduce block size/weight with a soft fork? Don't really see it happening tbh but the rest sounds good.
