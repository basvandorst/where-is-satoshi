They wont remove it, google is to big to care about stuff like this. Problem is that the majority of people link to bitcoin.com and not to bitcoin.org if we change that then the ranking will change.
But with people like 
linking to bitcoin.com as if it is the real website is what is causing it to rank so high.

Very few legit sites
I would stick to these 2 only
But in the end of the day just holding might be more profitable.

Thats like saying I want to buy crypto so I go to crypto.com
Bitcoin is a brand name and one would expect to land on its website when one googles bitcoin.

I agree with you that censorship is taken to far here but btc is such a shit show, if they came here with their non stop accusations and trolling I and many other would immediately leave. I mean I post 1 post here regarding something that is loosing real people money and the first thing you see there is a mod calling me a fake account, immediately jumping to the absolute extreme to defend themselves (when I didnt even attack them).
If bitcoin.com was fair then it would be no problem and people would not get confused but one look at rogers pinned tweet makes his intentions with it very clear.

As always the best thing to do is absolutely nothing.

99.99% of people dont know that. That makes it irrelevant.

Ahh. Depends where you are from. If you are in the US them most likely coinbase. Wherever you buy make sire you buy BTC.

I can imagine. We can blame people for going to the .com and expecting to be on the real site, that is how they what learned.

Sure man im gonna stop replying

Until like  commented they buy bitcoin cash and think they bought Bitcoin. Then as they look how the price go's up they decide to sell only to learn their bitcoin cash is not worth close as much. People forget, for mainstream adoption it has to be idiot proof.

Yes they all saw the pictures of those physical bitcoins.
That literally all they knew about it.

Dude my parents have no clue that Bitcoin is not a company. Lots of people I know used to think Bitcoin was physical gold coins. Just because we are in crypto everyday doesnt mean the world knows what the hell is going on. To find out they google bitcoin and land on that website. Newcomers have no idea what bitoin is and isnt.

It doesnt matter what you think bitcoin is and isnt. What matters is people that watch TV see bitcoin, they want to buy this already overwhelmingly confusing asset and then they get even more confused when they see there are 2 different versions that use the exact same address format. Where I am from none of the large fiat exchange support or even plan to support bitcoin cash leading to even more confusion and sending wrong coins to wrong wallets.
Now they need to keep track of what you send where to not loose money sending the wrong coin to the wrong address. Bitcoin is suppose to be easier than fiat not harder. When they try research the 2 differences they get such contradiction information from both sides calling each other trash they are left more confused than before they started. 
I deal with these question every day, new people dont understand any of this they just want bitcoin. By naming another coin the exact same name the only people that suffer are the newcomers.
