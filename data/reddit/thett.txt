The timelock is built-in in order to prevent any side from benefitting from disappearing, but in order for it to work, it must always be used, even when the parties are being honest. You couldopen a channel without timelock, but then, you have to trust the other guy not to disappear/lose keys/screw you over. Like a normal bank account.
@_date: 2018-01-10 11:25:23


How much would I have to pay for opening the channel? And are there fees within Lightning?
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:22:37


Lightning uses a timelock system that decreases with every TX - you can set an arbitrarily high timelock at the start, but you want to have a small timelock in order to be able to recover your funds if the counterparty disappears. In practice, you would want a timelock not higher than a year, and the time decrease needs to be significant (at least a day) in order to prevent race conditions. Once you run out of time, you cant use the channel anymore, and the owner(s) of that money are gonna want to have their money somehow. You have to close the channel.

The Lightning whitepaper states that even with Lightning, you would need 133 MB blocks in order to open two channels per human per year... and that seems like a small number of channels. The current ETH blocksize (after correcting for the block time) is something like 1.8 MB - BTC will need bigger blocks than that in the future. Blockchain growth affects all cryptos.
@_date: 2018-01-01 21:40:36

Shards can only reference themselves and the mainchain. As a node, you have to have the mainchain, and can choose to have any number of shards if their content is of interest to you.


You perfectly described the semantical definition. It's just important to understand that right now, everything happening in the entire Bitcoin ecosystem is on the Bitcoin mainchain, and in the future, it will not be. Future developments will challenge that definition a little.

@_date: 2017-12-27 21:33:51


No. The shards are closely integrated sidechains. On the main chain, you can see all transactions going in and out of the shards, and if you want to know whats going on inside, you'll have to look at that shard. From a "Do I have to follow them?"-perspective, they are sidechains.
A "blockchain broken up" would mean that you dont know all mainchain transactions or the balances of all mainchain addresses if you dont follow all shards. That is not the case.


While this is a little bit irrelevant to our discussion here - what is a "full archival node" in an ecosystem of Bitcoin and 10000 sidechains? The name becomes misleading, because its not a full archive of everything, just the stuff on the mainchain.

The issue at hand is that SegWit transactions are "anyone can spend" to old nodes. They are valid, but different. They can subsequently be used by anyone, and those transactions will be kind of a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-02-25 23:46:57
Yeah, but SegWit means long-term competition for on-chain transactions (through mostly off-chain transactions). They benefit from blocking it.
@_date: 2017-02-26 11:32:30
SegWit does not affect the block size itself. SegWit basically makes transactions smaller in size, so that more can fit into a 1MB block size. SegWit is frequently called "the equivalent of a 2MB block size" because of this. The block size can be changed independently from SegWit.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:19:30
Anything that replaces on-chain transactions with off-chain transactions will harm their income, much like Bitcoin hurts the credit card companies. Miners should favor BU simply because it keeps everything firmly under their control. They don't seem to be doing that for other reasons, though.
@_date: 2017-02-07 20:47:22
If you have twice as many transactions, but only half of them on-chain, it will be the exact thing they have right now.
You're really making a long-term argument here - in the short (or maybe even medium term), Bitcoin can definitely scale on block size alone. The miners want that money. 
Even on a long-term basis, a similar price effect can maybe be achieved with larger blocks. A lot of the argument from the Core people has previously revolved around decentralization, but centralization is not necessarily a bad thing if you're the central guy. You'd have to convince them that big blocks are (a) not viable long-term. If you can do that, you'll have to convince them that (b) being the miners in a lightning-dominated transaction ecosystem is more profitable than extracting monopoly rents from centralized Bitcoin and (c) that cashing in on high transaction fees and not caring about scaling right now is bad - they can still do one of the forks in a year or two. I havent seen anyone demonstrate a, b and c so far, so the miners will continue to hesitate.

@_date: 2017-03-19 09:53:15
The idea is basically that you dont have to validate the whole chain (or the whole block) yourself because you can be mathematically sure that somebody else did it and came up with a positive result. It requires PoW. I think it works through black magic, but Vitalik is adamant about calling it zk-Snarks. They also want to use that for anonymous transactions.
@_date: 2017-02-10 14:32:55
Why not both at the same time?
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:10:40


I know it is functional. But it does not require SegWit - a malleability fix would make it easier, but you can easily open payment channels only to parties you trust, and then send transactions over a few hops who all trust each other. What I was trying to say is that we don't know how many people are going to use lightning, for how many transaction, and how many transactions are done per opened channel. To put it simply, we don't know if it is a 10% capacity increase or a 10,000% capacity increase.


This is true, but only to a certain extent. The cost for storage space has halved since 2010. The cost for computing is going down steadily, too ([Figure 1 on this page]( You can't compare "the average computer" when the average computer gets cheaper and cheaper all the time. The failure of Moore's Law is not really relevant here, because economically, only the price per unit of computing matters, not how it is achieved.
I think that you could also factor in that nodes have a different sensitivity to price changes now - early Bitcoin enthusiasts usually have a few bucks to spend these days, and a lot of commercial node operators would run a datacenter node if they had too. This is a significant change compared to the early days.
Right now, you can build a full node from scratch for ~150 USD (by using [this guide]( and getting a 2 TB hard drive on top of it. blockchain is 100 GB these days, so it will last for a while). This is acceptable, even if it goes up a little. Your home internet connection will be able to handle the traffic as well, unless you live in a third-world country (or the bad parts of the US). Bitcoin does not have a node problem. Not right now, and not with 2 MB blocks with SegWit, either.
The node compensation problem could be solved without a protocol change by nodes only accepting transactions from (a) other nodes or (b) paying customers (I think). Not that it would be necessary now, but this is certainly not an insurmountable problem. You could also just "not solve" this problem; people will run nodes just for the financial benefits of having a node available for their business.


That is semantics, though. Multiple altcoins such as ETH (and even ETC) have gone through hard-forks where formally, an altcoin was created, but the previously existing coin died off. The altcoin then took over the name and the entire chain state of the main coin, and thereby turned into the old coin for all practical purposes.
EDIT: Grammar
@_date: 2017-03-09 20:16:49


That date should have been a year ago, and we do indeed need it now, because we don't know how many transactions they will take off the blockchain. Bitcoin needs a reliable way to scale up transactions as these second-layer are being developed. Lightning has never processed a production transaction so far; we need something more reliable than that. A block size increase has more uncertainty in deployment, but in use, it has no uncertainty.


Exactly. And nobody will run a node for a network that they cant afford to use.

I feel like transaction costs are relevant in this context as well. The degree of decentralization is about creating a good monetary system, but it becomes less useful as transaction costs increase. A great system that nobody uses is not that great, after all.

If you consider mainstream adoption, the non-financial cost of running a node will prevent that anyways - it would require an amount of effort and technical knowledge that most people are not willing to put up with. You can build a full node for $80 these days. Throw in a 2 TB drive for $70, and you'll be good for a while. Hell, throw in 5 drives because why not. If you're an idiot, you'll have to spend 100 hours on researching how this stuff works, and how to actually respond if your node rejects something. If you value your time at $15, buying one more hard drive wont be the dealbreaker. I know you can do it in 0.5 hours and I can do it in maybe 5, but I'd be surprised if my mom would manage to do it at all.
Even now, we have 8000 nodes and god knows how many users. This will get way worse as the less-technical people get on board. The average user will benefit from (a) some amount of other users validating the chain and (b) the mere threat of validation keeping institutions in check. I know this is bad, but this is the only path forward that I see. I really dont understand why you put so much emphasis on keeping the chain small. And why you don't mind blowing up the size through witness data.

I'm fully behind SegWit. No argument there. The thing with a hard-fork is that we should have done that a year ago, too.

Small blocks mean more fee per transaction, but a smaller number of transactions. The optimum will be a balance of the two; the miners will figure that one out. Limiting the blocksize will also prevent adoption and help the altcoins, so the bitcoin miners do have a strong incentive to keep prices low.

As a big-blocker, I want to say that I support SegWit. It is a good idea, and it should be implemented. But realistically, it only doubles (or maybe tripples, depending on transaction complexity) transaction volume - any future help through stuff like Lightning is speculation at this point. There is an old quote from Satoshi in which he says that Bitcoin capacity will grow naturally through the advancement of hardware technology - he was clearly expecting growth through "brute force" instead of "smart" additions. The 1 MB block size limit was implemented as an anti-spam measure at a time when blocks were maybe 10 KB; nobody ever intended it to be a limit for legitimate transactions in a more mature network (supported by more and larger nodes, miners, and businesses).
A big argument against increasing the block size was always the centralization argument - if we had 2 MB blocks, nodes would need more hard drive and bandwidth capacity, which might force some nodes offline. But SegWit witness data also means nodes have to move more data - it's not technically in the block, but it still needs to be sent around and stored. It was disingenuous to use this as an argument against the 2 MB hard-fork whilst supporting SegWit at the same time.
The core team (I know that it's a loose association of devs and not the Illuminati or something) and some people in the community need a kick in the butt about hard-forking. They tend to be incredibly conservative and greatly prefer soft-forks to hard-forks. Vitalik Buterin's post about his preference for hard-forks was almost exclusively met with "hurr durr he's an idiot" instead of rational arguments. He is one of the smartest people working in the cryptocoin space now, and his opinions are just dismissed outright. That's stupid. 
The biggest argument against a block size increase was that a hard-fork would have been too risky - if it lacked miner or user support, it might split the chain and even the user base. We're now at a point where both the users and the miners have split into two adversarial communities - essentially the worst-case scenario for a hard-fork - but we haven't seen any of the benefits of such a fork. Granted, the chain hasn't been split, but that is clearly missing a "yet". Either BU or some form of UASF will do that in the future. While I consider Core to be the more competent dev team by a long shot, I think their assessment of "social risks" regarding user and miner behaviour in a hard-fork situation has been catastrophically wrong.
I feel like a split should be avoided at all costs, and we should compromise with both a block-size hard-fork and a SegWit activation, possibly through the same hard-fork. I lack the technical understanding to verify if Emergent Consensus can work if implemented correctly, but we definitely need a mechanism for future block-size increases. Maybe that should be a "hard roadmap", or Emergent Consensus, or whatever. Maybe enshrine a few future hardforks into code now, so that everyone on the new chain will be running the proper code already? I don't know what is best here, but I know that the current approach isn't best.

So much this. If you truly believe that miner influence has taken over Bitcoin, there is no way of taking it back. Satoshi designed Bitcoin from the ground up with the "one CPU, one vote - through mining" model in mind. He anticipated many things, but not GPU mining and ASICs. A hardfork with a PoW change will have 0.01% miner support, and you'll also have that billion dollar industry trying every trick in the book to make you fail. Oh, and you would be going against the original Bitcoin whitepaper with something like a user-activated hard-fork. BTC never had a hard-fork before, too. It might be easier to just silently switch to some new coin for purely political reasons.

BU certainly has some merit, because it's a good algorithm for adapting the block size more dynamically in the future. Blocking SegWit und not implementing BU properly are major no-nos, though.
@_date: 2017-03-20 19:34:30
Concerning 2), how quickly would SegWit activate with the departure of the anti-segwit hashrate? If the activation period (after 95% is reached) would be below that one difficulty increase period, the additional SegWit capacity might help ease the pain of the transition period. One might even program SegWit to watch out for a BU fork and activate the moment it occurs. A hard-fork-activated soft-fork, if you know what I mean.

@_date: 2017-03-09 17:26:10
The argument about SegWit and BU is a false dichotomy. We need both. If you want to use Lightning as a global transaction network for everyday stuff, there's no way the settlement layer can be limited by 1 MB blocks (or even the maybe-up-to-4 MB SegWit allows for). We'll have to increase the block size, probably multiple times, and maybe even adjust it down in the end as better second- and third-layer solutions become available. Blocksize needs to be dynamic. This seems to be working for other blockchain-based systems, and I don't understand why it shouldn't work for Bitcoin as well.
One argument that I never understood is the argument about decentralization. Very small blocks allow every little Joe Schmuck to run a node, but they won't get to use the actual blockchain they are storing on their node. There needs to be a trade-off between transaction cost and node-running cost.
@_date: 2017-03-05 14:57:51
I still dont understand why people think about the 1 MB block size in terms of decentralisation. It was introduced for completely different reasons, and if you want to maintain the level of decentralisation that existed at that time, you should be able to scale up blocks as hard drive space and bandwidth available to the average user grow. It seems to me that there should be a natural growth curve for block size that ensures a constant level of decentralisation. The alternative to 1 MB blocks is not datacenter nodes, the alternative to 1 MB blocks is 2 MB blocks and a mechanism that allows for future growth without hard forks. While SegWit is clearly a good thing, I dont understand why the Core team is so fixated on keeping the block size constant at all cost. We now have to deal with politically ambiguous miners AND a divided community.

Bitcoin will be improved by its success. And nobody will lose any money, because you get to keep your coins on both chains anyways.
But I know you think differently about this, so I'll just try to look at this from your perspective, okay? Right now, Bitcoin has a large amount (or even a majority) of malicious miners and a minority of very stupid users. All these people are stirring up some shit right now, but they will all voluntarily leave at an unknown future date. They will create their fun little altcoin that you will never even touch, so that Bitcoin can remain with its honest miners and smart users. SegWit will probably be activated after the malicious miners leave. The one thing that worries you is replay attacks. I think they will fix that before a fork, but let's just assume that they wont. You will never touch that stupid altcoin, so there is no risk of new-chain transactions spilling over to the normal chain for you. Your regular bitcoin transactions will be mirrored on that stupid altcoin, but since the coins are worthless and you will never touch them, thats really not a problem to you. People transacting on the altcoin might lose some of their real bitcoins, but they deserve no better. You should wish for that hard-fork to happen as soon as possible.

Yes, thats my whole point. When the price gets too high, people wont use Bitcoin, or maybe for fewer purposes. If you want people to use Bitcoin, it has to be cheap. Thats why the scaling problem is called a problem.
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:00:01


Same goes for Unlimited. Just keep your own chain if they fork. The SegWit chain would look pretty ridiculous to a non-SW node, to be honest. If everything is everyone-can-spend, the currency is kind of useless. You cant even spend the anyone-can-spend stuff. I would agree that BU does this on a more serious level, but both represent a significant change.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:11:36
No, I was wondering what you are smoking. Your copypasta sounds pretty crazy, to be honest. I think SegWit is actually a 2.1 increase (and potentially more, depending on transaction complexity), you should update your rambling.
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:58:36
I still remember the old days when people got banned from for suggesting a hardfork, because altcoins arent allowed. I'm not hedging my bets with this shit anymore. There are quite a few individuals in the Bitcoin space who love to impose their view on other people, and Jihan Wu and Roger Ver are by no means the worst. I'll go for a hardfork the next time I get the chance, purely because of the politics. I'm also pretty sure that 1 MB wont be big enough for the settlement layer of enough payment channels to serve the entire world, so we'll have to hard-fork anyways. Might as well do it when the politics allow for it.

It seems like the only solution that can be implemented on short notice, though - the core dev team have for one reason or another not been able to develop other, more complex solutions quickly enough. They didn't seem to have the foresight to respond to this earlier, and they were not able to communicate their decision and the reasoning behind it convincingly. Not permitting debate about the block size increase on because it is essentially an altcoin was a terrible move - regardless of whether or not actions on a private forum can be considered censorship, it does nothing to further the debate about Bitcoin scaling, and it alienates people who consider that to be the better solution.
@_date: 2017-03-17 16:06:16
Well, you cant support SegWit and Unlimited at the same time because there is no code that implements both. That is a downside if you consider Unlimited to be an important thing to support, too.

I think Im a bit out of the loop here - what happened?
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:31:19
No, it's basically a bet. Fork = BCU wins, no fork = BCC wins. Only the winner is cashed out. BCU would be cashed out in coins of the forked chain (BTU), and BCC would be cashed out in coins of the old chain (BTC).
You can just hodl your coins regularly for the outcome you have described - a fork means that your coins exist separately on both chains.
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:23:41
Attacking the chain would be quite difficult, actually. It's easy to come in with overwhelming hashpower and produce empty blocks, but adding more hashpower will make the difficulty adjustment come sooner. Any attack would hurt the "let's hope it just withers and dies" vector.

"Core" as an entity doesnt exist, so they cannot reasonably accept anything. Having the 5 top people is as close as you will get in the real world.

Why are we having this whole debate if you guys are behind a hard-fork, then? Or, if you supported it in the past, why didn't it happen then?

If you want to use Lightning, you need a coordinating authority to create a "chain" of payment channels for your transaction. That organisation will require some kind of payment to fund their operations. Easy to make money from that.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:25:30
Nope: 
SegWit stores some stuff outside of the regular block space. This allows them to store it a little bit more efficiently, but the main improvement is that the MAX_BLOCKSIZE constant is not affected by that data anymore. This witness data tends to be bigger for more complex applications (transactions from multisig addresses, for example) - this is why you hear stuff like "SegWit is equivalent to a block size of 1.7 MB" and "SegWit is equivalent to a block size of 2.1 MB". You dont know in advance how many complex transactions there will be. I think it can be up to 4 MB when every transaction is very complex.
It's important to note that SegWit also changes some other stuff related to scaling, like allowing for a different hashing function that scales linearly and not quadratically (which is bad for performance and gets worse the more data you have to hash).

Couldnt you apply the same argument to Core? If you dont like the way Bitcoin is going, just make your own Coin. I hear VertCoin is trying to implement SegWit. You could use this argument to oppose any change in the Bitcoin system.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:13:09
Retargeting happens every two weeks, but the time is measured through the number of blocks. If 90% of the miners go away, only 10% remain. Mining two weeks worth of blocks will take ten times as long (20 weeks) then. It's hard to predict how long this will take in reality because you dont know how much mining support you will have.

@_date: 2017-03-07 20:50:29
Core is a perfect example of why tech isnt everything. They are definitely the most competent dev team out there, but they are laughably bad at building a social consensus around their solutions. They signed the Hongkong agreement, refused to honor it, and now they're blaming the miners for trying to take control of bitcoin or something. During this whole debacle of growing capacity issues, all we got was the proposal of hard-forking to make blocks smaller in the future, and the recent post by to report some blockchain startup to the cops for using the Bitcoin chain. There's a lot of "hurr durr BU is retarded" in here (which is even correct to a certain extent), but the core team needs to fix some of their own issues if they want Bitcoin to move forward successfully. If you breach your contracts, nobody wants to do business with you anymore. I seriously hope that this is a wake-up call to them.

As I specifically mentioned in my previous component, that is computing per price, not per average computer. Computers havent gotten that much faster, but they have gotten a lot cheapers, so you can get a better one for the same price.


While I understand the philosophical argument here, thats how 99% of people treat technology. The average joe will not run some money software on his computer, regardless of how performant it is. My parents can barely read their own email, they won't run a node, ever. Nodes will remain a thing for enthusiasts and people doing it for philosophical reasons.


a) Yes. As they do now. b) Yes, but my point is that the nodes could charge them, too. Outside of the Bitcoin protocol. Wanna send a tx? Thats gonna cost you 3 cents on top of the tx fee.


Companies always outsource stuff, regardless of how cheap it is. I don't see how thats an argument here. How many of the current nodes are running on AWS?

@_date: 2017-03-19 21:17:22
Yeah, but that letter was written when they would be able to choose between Current BTC and BTC Unlimited. A choice between BTC Unlimited and BTC with forced SegWit is different. It's essentially two competing hard-forks at the same time. The "normal" Bitcoin chain would basically be the third option there. Oddly enough, activated BU is actually compatible with current BTC as long as the Emergent Consensus is 1 MB, while Forced SegWit wouldnt be compatible. They might give the BTC name to BU, then. This is a clusterfuck of epic proportions.

They actually said that they want to do the blocksize-fork first, so that is consistent. If they would just activate SegWit now, the other side would get what they want, but they wouldnt get what they want. They're holding out for a compromise (or forking to get what they want).
@_date: 2017-03-15 15:41:13
But thats the whole point. Bitcoin is about me controlling my own money, through the private keys. Clicking around on Coinbase is the same as a traditional bank. The money is just labeled "Bitcoin" instead of "Dollar", but as long as I dont get to touch it, thats just a meaningless label on their website. The vision of Bitcoin is not to be a new label on a website, it is about decentralized money. You cant sit here and send Bitcoin users back to the fucking banks.
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:22:03
Yeah, but neither will keeping the block size small.
My dad used to work at a bank. Bitcoin with only 100 nodes is still A LOT better than that stuff; crippling Bitcoin adoption with tiny blocks will only hurt us. Even if Lightning turns out to be the magical unicorn everyone expects it to be, there's no way you can run the settlement layer on the 4-MB-equivalent that SegWit is. We will have to hard-fork anyways, so we might as well do it know and prevent this huge schism.
@_date: 2017-03-07 20:54:38
Shouldnt it be in the communities power to overrule the central group of developers on individual issues? Having a few people decide everything goes against the decentralized vision of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:53:24
Well, SegWit allows the data associated with one block to grow way beyond 1 MB. Technically, the block itself still has the 1 MB limit, but you're kind of messing with the definition of a block here, so the statement is actually true.
@_date: 2016-06-19 22:30:57
You can't get free Ether. It is simply put into a child DAO, so you'll have to wait a month until you can get the money (which might be after any fork). They also found another vulnerability that allows the motherDAO to get shares in the childDAO without its permission, which would in turn enable them to use the first vulnerability against the childDAO. It's a mess. The original attacker (probably) just made money by shorting Ether.

To be honest, they made a deal for SegWit and a block size increase, but they only came through with SegWit. This is what they wanted before, so they basically ignored the compromise. The (not official) 300kB publication by a core developer is just icing on the cake; the miners are rightfully pissed about this right now. If they go for BU, Blockstream is done.
@_date: 2017-01-30 15:42:35
There is a bit of literature on this; this basically happened to ETH with ETC after the TheDAO hard fork. You essentially have 1 BTC on each chain, but since all addresses and private keys are the same, a transaction would be valid on both chains as well. The Ethereum people found a way to have a "smart" transaction that would produce different outputs on each chain (using that one different block as the trigger), so people could transfer their funds to different wallets on the different chains and have them be "unique" again.

This is why I am actually surprised that the miners dont support Unlimited. It seems that when they can basically pick the block size they want, they should be able to pick out the one that gives them the most revenue, regardless of how big or how small it is. The fact that they didnt shows to me that there is some kind of internal politics at play here. Which is bad for a system that is supposed to be transparent, public and decentralized.

The major argument against bigger blocks is the size of the total chain. If you just make the same blocks faster, you get the same size increase and additional problems (more orphaned blocks and lots of other complex stuff). I'd be interested in hearing about this from someone more knowledgeable as well, but as far as I understand, it's not worth it.
@_date: 2017-01-30 01:12:27
I've voted summer 2017, but I would have supported an even earlier hardfork (which is obviously impossible now).
I think Bitcoin needs on-chain scaling, and I'm relieved that this is finally discussed in this forum. It is unfortunate that the people behind the block size increase dont seem to be as competent as the people at Core; a HF should obviously only be done in a proper manner, so I find myself between a rock and a hard place here. It might be prudent for Core to support a block size increase purely to prevent further damage to the community and the bitcoin protocol as whole. BTC splitting into two chains would be a disaster for everyone involved, and greatly set back Bitcoin as a system reliable enough for financial transactions (be it direct payments or lightning settlements) in the eye of the wider public. Stuff like Bitcoin ETFs will be much harder if the bitcoin ecosystem is shown to be unstable.
There should be some kind of compromise approach with both SegWit and a block size increase. I'd also caution against a hard fork to 2 MB (or any fixed value), we will just have the same problem again in a while. Going forward, there should be a mechanism for the community to change (or maintain) the block size without the problems usually associated with a hard fork. I dont have the knowledge necessary to say if the BU approach to this is appropriate, but it does seem reasonable to me.
@_date: 2017-08-16 20:28:18

@_date: 2018-06-07 21:22:55


You can invalidate that particular chain by implementing some kind of anchoring, but they can always start a new Jihan-chain of BTC. You have to add more and more Jihan-chains to your blocklist. Its not something you can really implement as part of the consensus. The most efficient way would be for the nodes to pull a blocklist from a centralized place (or a few of them) that maintain the blocklist. But that quite obviously goes against the very principles we are trying to defend.
Changing the mining algorithm is the correct solution. That was actually one of the arguments for SegWit - it supposedly hurt some ASICs. ASIC-resistant mining algorithms have been tried by multiple Bitcoin-based shitcoins, so it should be technologically feasible. As far as I understand, Core doesnt seem to investigate this too closely. If anyone is aware of the reasoning behind it, I'd be very interested.

I think were about to have a much larger discussion again, but your line of thinking is correct - it just means that BTC is limited to medium/high-value transfers for wealthy people (wealthy by global, not local standards).

ETH was censored not by unilateral action, but by the collective choice of the community. Vitalik and/or the Ethereum Foundation can only censor transactions by publicly proposing such censorship to the community and convincing everyone of it - which is true for Bitcoin as well. 
On top of that, BTC can be censored by unilateral action from a single actor, who is even known to be greedy. That is the problem.


How so? ETH has more inflation, but fiat is money and has inflation, so that cant be it.

It actually used to be a lot higher, it has been blocked by miners with wildly fluctuating hashrate. Mostly the Vrn guy, and, more recently, the Vqr address as well. They are most likely buying hashpower to manipulate the market and/or block segwit for political reasons. They have an anti-ASIC PoW, so even if you had an outrageous amount of ASICs and wanted to block it, you would have to buy GPU hashrate from normal people.

JP Morgan has its own traders, and people who buy and sell as intermediaries for third parties. Analogy: He would fire his traders if they invested in a pile of shit. But if they invested into shit piles for other people who pay fees to JP Morgan, he is fine with that. Obviously. The things we are observing have easy explanations.

It might also cause people to seek out investments with unrealistically high returns, causing them to invest in shitty stuff. There is no indication that this would cause a focus on high-quality investment. 
Youre talking about an equilibrium, but consider the other side of credit - if you want to build or grow a company, credit is now more expensive and more scarce. It is harder to build and grow companies. This is bad.


Exactly. You want the velocity of money to be high.


Companies usually sell bonds because they want to have even more money, because they do indeed use those underlying resources more efficiently. We should encourage companies to do more of this by bringing down the cost associated with selling bonds (or debt in general).

You are making a moral argument, not an economic one.


They'll be really happy with their non-inflating bank accounts until they realize that the economy is no longer developing further because credit is really hard to come by, slowing down innovation and technical progress, thereby reducing their standard of life.


You wouldnt lecture a plumber about plumbing without looking into some plumbing resources, would you?

Dont forget Bitcoin 2.0 or some shit like that

Peoples willingness to pay comes from the transaction as a whole, though. They will be willing to pay more per bit when the transaction has less bits.

Vertcoin also just activated it, they trippled in the last few days. Nothing else happened there, so thats the pure SegWit effect. Hard to judge shitcoin movements, though.
@_date: 2017-05-18 15:43:27
The Hongkong Agreement had similar vague language in regards to a 2 MB hard-fork. I'd be surprised if they sign something like that again. 2 MB and SegWit will happen at the exact same blockheight.

As a german, I have literally never heard of them.

They dont seem to look at it like that
@_date: 2017-05-21 12:11:08
This is an unfair comparison. The median fee for Ether is 4 cents; that is what a normal user will pay. The average is distorted because a few developers run very complex smart contracts on the ethereum chain. If you want to compare transaction fees on different chains, you have to compare the same action (sending coins from A to B), otherwise you are comparing apples to oranges.

Guys, I dont think the order is evidence of anything. It could be a hint or something like that. The author of the linked article calls it "hard evidence" IN THE FUCKING TITLE, and thats somewhere between clickbait and fake news.
@_date: 2016-07-28 22:27:18


Can somebody explain this? This seems to suggest that there is an upside to paying for transactions behind the scenes instead of directly through the fee system.

Mastercard would disagree
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:12:20
When Bitcoin goes mainstream, it will easily have that many economic transactions.
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:44:10
So no actual argument on your side?
@_date: 2017-06-19 13:58:15
Yes. But Mastercard has been providing a tremendous amount of value to the world for decades. Just because it is obsolete in the long term doesnt mean that it does not have a value.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:25:09
Yeah, but it requires software updates and such. It might take a while for everyone to upgrade their embedded devices and whatnot.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:35:16
SW reducing the number of total (!) on-chain transactions is purely hypothetical. Yes, more transactions will fit into each block and some transactions will be off-chain, but (a) adding new capacity to an overloaded network will cause the new capacity to be used up at least partially and, most importantly, (b) introducing a nice new feature such as SegWit might also bring A LOT more usage. The assumption that SegWit will be a net benefit to the mempool size is just that, an assumption.
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:44:20


Yeah, fuck the poor... Bitcoin is primarily intended as a good investment for rich people! /s
@_date: 2017-06-19 18:17:24
Yes, but in terms of the number of transactions, it is a good test for the future. Regardless of why the spikes happened. Thats what he argued for.
@_date: 2017-06-19 15:02:51
I meant utility, too. Mastercard provides utility. Every time you use it. Even if you dont use it anymore, I guess you used it in the past, and many people are using it right now.
@_date: 2017-06-08 17:46:47
No, I mean that a larger block size will also be needed

You do realize that the Silk Road founder was arrested for having someone murdered? He was most certainly the bad guy. Same goes for all the drug-trafficking going on there. I might not favor banning it, but thats democracy.
