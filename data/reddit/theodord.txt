Did you know that the """bcash""" community resents lightning?
A 2nd layer solution is not wanted by them ATM.

What the fuck is it with those cars?

Because they probably don't have smartphones.

Oh, that's what you mean.
My apologies.
Yes, this seems like an okay time to sell, **if** you want to.

I am quite new to the whole BTC thing myself. Please get a second opinion.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:48:00
This 
This is (part of) the problem.
This is why all these forks are happening and why there are people shitting on each other on both sides of the current fiasco.
But apparently a solution is around the corner. The Lighting Network will prob. resolut in a decreased network load and thus much lower fees  (and extremely little fees within the network).

BTC's diff will go down -9.05% in about 1 day, 12 hours.
BCH's diff will go down an unknown amount in 2 days, 4 hours.

I wish i had it in my own wallet and not in coinbase...
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:49:13
Thank you  :)
@_date: 2017-08-19 09:17:29
Sorry but what?
In what world are 10$ fees for a 2$ transaction not an issue?
Especially if you have to wait like two hours for it to be confirmed.
The scalability of bitcoin core is an issue, and it needs to be addressed if the currency wants to penetrate the day-to-day tx market.
I really like BTC, I have the bulk of my money there. But acting like the status quo is working fine is just... irresponsible.

I don't know anything about Bitpay TBH, but generally speaking if you put your bitcoins into a hoster like coinbase or something along those lines, you don't have access to those coins.
You have access to a web interface over which you can ask your hoster to do certain things with those coins, but as long as you don't have access to the wallet.dat file, you are never in control and your coins are at the mercy of the hoster.
But, in case of a hard fork, you will still have your coins. They won't disappear. In the case of a split network, your coins will be on **both** networks.
Edit: Forgot to answer the 2nd question.

Sorry but what is fud?
I keep reading it
@_date: 2017-08-18 06:41:37
Thanks for the advice.
I was using coinbase because of it's ease of use and as a money savings account.
I will take them out of the vault and transfer them (damn you coinbase with you fixed fees).
Maybe I will check in with another hoster when the situation has cleared. I don't really trust myself.

Thing is, IMHO the 2MB Update should have been started a few months ago.
It would have bought some time until LH and other solutions came to fruition, and a short term solution for the ridiculous fees.
Implementing 2MB on a short notice would be irresponsible.
But I am generally in Support of a 2MB Block, as long as other long term solutions and optimizations for the scalability problem are being worked on.
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:19:14
That is why the implementation of a short term Solution should have started months ago, so it would clear the Issue until more long term solutions like LH are ready.

Dude no.
The point of bitcoin is not to create profit but a decentralized, non-governed currency.
What use is a currency if it is not usable in day-to-day or even week-to-week transactions?
I am actually scared to pull out right now because that would mean I would have to pay like 7$ in fees.
For me, that's a **lot** of money.
The status quo is not sustainable.
Solutions like the lightning network are coming, and personally I **really** hope they work well and take off.

I don't really get the rivalry.
People are throwing shit at each other from both sides, misrepresenting each other and the facts are getting burried underneath a torrent of ignorance.
Just use the crypto you think is good and let the next two weeks decide who will come out on top.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:53:39
I don't think lowering standards are the appropriate reaction.
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:39:35
Of course you can.
Many wallets and exchanges measure the amount of bitcoins in mBTC or even smaller values.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:41:21
I mean, with the fees such as they are/where the scaling problem is a valid debate to have.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:45:19
Speaking of which: Are there any news on the lightning thing?
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:25:30

I was using it because it's easy to just put a reacurring transaction from my bank account to coinbase in order to have a bitcoin savings account.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:37:59
As a relative newbie to the whole thing who refuses to take a side I am quite tired of the whole shitshow.
I feel like pulling out of crypto all together and waiting this one out.
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:17:10
Why is this getting downvoted?
It's a legit question.
@_date: 2017-08-18 23:45:27
Please don't.
Stuff like this will just heighten tensions between the camps which is completely unnecessary.
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:57:10
Thank you for the article.
All tough it seems a bit biased, it was an interesting read.
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:24:23
What makes you so sure that it will crash tho?
@_date: 2017-08-18 22:33:19
Sorry but people from the other side of the fence are saying the same, replacing only the curreny....
This isn't convincing.
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:36:37
I used coinbase because it was easy to set a repeating transaction from my bank to them and have a BTC savings account without having to worry about anything.
I made the mistake of putting them into the BTC Vault.
It takes two whole days to withdraw from that.
Should be done some time today night.
PSA: Don't use coinbase, especially the Vault!

I have to disagree.
LN could be an option, but saying that legitimate purchases of goods and services is a clutter to the blockchain seems to go against the basic idea of what a currency even is.

Citation that Ver created Bitcoin Cash?
I think he's an investor who is very vocal about it (makes sense because he invested in it) but not the creator.
I watched the split and I believe it was an community effort
