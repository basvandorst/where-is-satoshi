That's still some good profit on that trade

Looks like that's in your house, if so how do you deal with the noise and heat?

Very misleading title

You can run a node with only 90GB worth of the blockchain though

The stock market works the same exact way

OR this is just a charity with no ulterior motive, but nah that would make too much sense it's obviously a conspiracy
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:04:39
That's the software for Bitcoin, not the cryptocurrency itself
@_date: 2018-08-02 00:01:46
How does that punish them?
@_date: 2018-05-29 03:18:16
Ah okay that makes much more sense

You think so? What has changed regarding scalability in the Bitcoin protocol since the $50 fees of December?
@_date: 2018-06-12 22:34:16
Also based on @_date: 2018-06-23 03:20:43
Not all altcoins are tokens and not all are premined. You shouldn't generalize the crypto market like that. Some coins are making huge progress in tech and scalability while also partnering with multi-billion dollar corporations, and creating real use cases that Bitcoin could only dream of (currently that is, Bitcoin tech will hopefully get better and scale properly).

But gift coupons aren't decentralized ;)
I think of holding VET like holding stock and getting VTHO as getting dividends. It's not the same thing, but its similar enough to get the point across. In order to develop apps and systems on VeChain, corporations will need to use VET, while also paying VTHO to utilize the blockchain. The only reason VTHO exists is to create a stable currency, so the fees of using the blockchain is stable for corporations. VeChain isn't supposed to be a currency like BTC, BCH, LTC it is a BaaS for corporations.

Did he say the word sell anywhere in that post?

I'm okay with banks blocking crypto purchases on credit cards since that isn't your money, but once they start blocking debit cards and controlling what I do with MY money, that's when I get pissed. Thank God my bank has been working perfectly fine with my crypto purchases

I disagree completely, there's a protocol war going on right now with some very promising  coins/token out there. (Also lots of shitcoins) I am diversifying so I'm more likely to reach the moon ;) nah, honestly at this point I'd like to just turn a profit

"only" double

Ask and you shall receive
@_date: 2018-06-09 17:01:21
Very convincing argument
@_date: 2018-06-11 00:32:53
Not even close, Bitcoin is deinflationary in nature
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:00:48
Not all altcoins are POW or POS though

He sure has fun in the meantime though

The stock market did fantastic in 2017, I'm not sure what you're talking about 
@_date: 2018-06-16 23:04:50
Satoshi could be both?
@_date: 2018-06-23 03:01:51
VET is the currency used in the VeChain ecosystem
@_date: 2018-06-10 20:13:25
Altcoins are any other crypto coin/token besides the big OG papa Bitcoin. Cryptocurrency encompasses Bitcoin AND altcoins
