@_date: 2017-02-21 06:36:56
Was it a green candle bar?
@_date: 2017-02-10 07:05:17
Ahah i used to do the same long ago... :)
@_date: 2015-05-04 02:19:26
Could you please explain how you did it? I downloaded crypto watch app but can't add the complication on the watch face. Is that the app you downloaded? Thank you
@_date: 2016-01-04 22:38:29
selling bitecoins
@_date: 2017-03-01 19:09:03
Ahahah i love you! Best post ever!
@_date: 2015-05-25 07:08:11
No one there to go clean up that mess?? Just remove the bitcoin logo, it's really bad advertisement IMO..
@_date: 2019-03-22 09:28:47
Me too, used the credit card two times for 2 considerable amount and all went ok...
@_date: 2016-06-12 05:57:19
But why always during the week end?? General public don't buy during the week end. A hearty rise I think should be spread during all day of the week, thoughts?
@_date: 2019-03-29 14:00:35
Can u pm me also?

None of my friends is smart enough and curious enough to spend 30 minutes of their time and investigating... they DESERVE to stay where they are!
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:16:49
Prepare to look back in 3 years and realize that you paid a million dollar for that piece of meat!
@_date: 2016-11-16 01:42:55
More or less like gold and cash. So better not to let everyone know how many bitcoin you have. Maybe keep a wallet with few just to show in case anyone wants something... and keep the real one well hidden
@_date: 2016-12-30 22:39:07
@_date: 2019-08-27 08:34:17
Well but in many places you see prices in dollars also... never tried to ask if they actually accept them
@_date: 2019-08-05 20:03:14
Is it legit? I don’t see anything on official website. Only on 
@_date: 2016-12-06 21:41:01
Just finished watching it. Very informative and well done.
@_date: 2019-08-27 01:13:42
Ah ok I thought it was. Sorry then
@_date: 2019-10-27 06:47:25
What’s that app that shows the total portfolio?
@_date: 2019-02-17 07:22:26
They have been told that they have to be proud of their country since they are child. And when someone teaches you something since you are a kid you believe and you tent not to question it if you are the average man... like my religion teacher told me once that Jesus walked on the water and I still believe it! 
@_date: 2019-06-20 14:50:44
I would kill him and then take the bitcoin. Oh wait. Where did he write the private keys! Fuck....
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:12:26
Well it’s all relative my friend...
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:53:08
Could you tell me more about this??
@_date: 2017-11-17 07:03:42
Ahh ok now it’s clear... Yes I just got the 4 series ;)
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:13:29
Ahah thank you! 1Cd432UUneG7hpjKAiF4UENayBbf4vnym9
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:51:26
Where is this feature hidden? I only see recurring buys.. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:55:56
Ahhh ok thanks :)
@_date: 2015-07-03 13:21:52
I think bitches accepting Bitcoin could be the real killer application we are all waiting for ;)
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:58:40
Yes I know how ifttt works. I was just wondering if you get like a ticker in the display of the BMW...
@_date: 2017-04-19 06:14:47
Not working in iOS right?
@_date: 2018-02-13 13:07:17
Ok and at the end of the year I call you to calculate taxes on capital gains with thousands of transactions...
@_date: 2017-09-17 00:50:07
Can’t we just stop with these stupid questions???
@_date: 2017-09-17 01:18:03
yes sorry you are right. I’m not eng mother tongue... :)
@_date: 2017-10-15 20:39:20
Love it!!!
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:08:41
How often is it updating??? With all this price movements sometimes it gets stuck for like 20 minutes and it shows a price 200 USD less that the real time one ahaha :) Jokes apart, sometimes it doens’t update regularly... Is there a way to put the sync time like every 5 minutes? Can’t find it...
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:20:50
Try to select one very fast and click sell... maybe it works!!!
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:56:47
Because you can't put cash inside your phone to get bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-10-22 06:36:55
I don't thing it is because you can't put the stock complication on that specific watch face (chronograph). It must be a new app with it's own complication. Would be nice to know which one... 
@_date: 2015-02-26 17:29:21
Love the first comment:
"I was expecting a more sophisticated level of maturity from The Economist, not the following:
"Mind-boggling cryptography and secret codes", guess it also uses magic and unicorns... that's a way to explain a technology.
"Even in relatively good years, the industry gets by on average global profit margins of one or two per cent." - yes, but the figure is in tens of billions, which sounds a bit more intimidating compared to a flimsy one percent "pocket change" comparison.
"... PayPal and so forth—work well enough, but can be costly, slow and vulnerable to fraud" - this isn't what distinguishes Bitcoin technology from the rest. In fact, bitcoin currency is no that much less prone to be stolen. ... god who hired this guy to write this?
He could have also written that PayPal color is blue and bitcoin's is yellow, which is why the latter is "more kool".
Moreover bitcoin IS slower than paypal, credit cards and hard cold cash for that matter. It takes quite some time for transactions to be approved and added to the blockchain, oh wait, its all magic and secret codes...
"The nature of international travel also means that foreign currency transactions are common-place." - Now isn't that a surprise?!
"A single, cross-border payment tool would make life simpler" - yes, it's called a credit card and you can have it in thai bhats and pay for an item listed in swiss franks and the conversion will be done by... yes magic and unicorns, instantaneously.
.. and so on ..
great article by the way. made my day. sarcasm."

Ok I know you are all right... never ever coinbase again, lesson learned... but I am stuck now. One week later money from sepa is still not in my account. and they don't answer. What should I do now?? 
@_date: 2019-05-23 18:14:52
I fall in love with BTC thanks to him in 2014... I totally agree with what you said
@_date: 2017-06-30 06:42:19
I confirm I went there 2 months ago and there were some guys standing in front of the ATM waiting for people like me and they bought my Bitcoin for cash... go there either you find some random people or you deal with the ATM.
