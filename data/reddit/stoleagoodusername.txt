It's going in the wrong direction. Normally the bitcoin payment mechanism goes like this: The merchant gives you an address and an amount to send, and then you send it through your phone and the internet. The coin can't do anything like that because it's not connected to the internet or able to receive information rather than send it like normal credit card payments.
The coin just stores the information that would normally be on the magnetic strip of the credit card, and retransmits that to the credit card scanner when you scan the coin.
I stress as before, the ONLY way to do this would be to use some sort of bitcoin debit card, which would also compromise your bitcoin wallet's inherent security quite a bit. Now someone could just steal the card, and they'd be able to make irreversible transactions until you cancelled the card.

I have been accused a hacker many times at school. Most recently, I had some free time in IT class, so I started up PuTTY and started doing updates to my server and chatting on IRC. (admittedly, the PuTTY default is black background, green font) The teacher comes over and randomly starts lecturing me about the 'acceptable use policy' for the computers, before I show her that it's my own server, and she has nothing to worry about.

Can we talk about minors for a second? Accountability is great and everything, but I, at 16, can't utilize any of these great services popping up for bitcoin. I have a bank account in my own name. I have my own bitcoin account. But any attempt to link them is thwarted by the fact that I'm not 18. It makes buying bitcoin REALLY difficult. Circle is no different, and they basically told me to keep playing with my monopoly money when I entered my DOB.
Imagine if minors couldn't use cash. Imagine if I couldn't get a debit card because I'm 16. But I can, and therefore I can be a consumer. But I find it difficult to buy bitcoin through this system, since I basically have to go through a parent or someone over 18. And so I can't be a bitcoin consumer, not really.
Just something to think about.

In my mind, if Satoshi doesn't come out himself, nobody should be trying to unmask him. The man indeed wants his privacy, and why the hell can't people respect that.
Plus, I kind of like not knowing who Satoshi is. It makes him a sort of Stig character in this whole bitcoin thing.

One would think so, but my friend and I walked into our local credit union with ID and an SSN and we had full checking and savings accounts the same day. No parent co-signature, it's fully in my name. They have even said I can open a credit card on my own as long as I attend some financial responsibility seminar, which I'll probably end up doing so I can build a bit of credit.

They can't add BTC as an option. All they do is sell you a device that is able to transmit credit card info to a merchant. The only way this would work is if you had a debit card which would automatically exchange and then pay in USD.

Yeah but *now* it's time to take bitcoin seriously
@_date: 2018-04-24 18:58:11


They are regionally separated, and even then this causes enough undue confusion.


It's not, though. It's Bitcoin Cash. Can it not stand on it's own and make it's own name?


The original is, however, created through network consensus. The network consensus is that Bitcoin should still exist, while Bitcoin Cash should exist as a separate entity, and that's fine.
If Bitcoin is worse, then Bitcoin Cash will be the name in the media anyway. There's no need to make this half-assed attempt to confuse people that it's the "real" Bitcoin. Instead it can be "bitcoin with these improvements and we're calling it bitcoin cash" and if people agree, they will jump on board.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:00:16
Important to note: the people hating on Bitcoin Cash aren't always at odds with the technical details of the coin either, but can take issue with the marketing which basically tries to claim it's the "one true Bitcoin", as seen in OPs photo.
In my opinion, and my opinion is not a very strong one, the idea should be able to stand on it's own without trying to trick people that it's the "real" Bitcoin. The marketing strategy is off putting for me.
@_date: 2018-04-24 17:53:43
That's fine though, people can make their own choices without being misled. Ethereum can be loads better and the name Ethereum will gain the spotlight if the public agrees.

Have a look at the US. Barring Obamacare, which has made prices rise slightly on the insurance end of things but changed little else, we have this free and open market as you state. But what's the result? There's no race to the bottom on pricing, only sky high prices. My dad broke his leg slipping on the ice this winter, and even after insurance it cost him $5000 out of pocket. If you didn't have that money? Sorry bud, you're going into debt or declaring bankruptcy.

@_date: 2018-04-24 18:02:10
Well, it is the original core, so it does, at very least, have claim to the name. If people want to take a different path with the codebase, that's fine, but they should not claim to be the original, rather they should choose their own name and the name recognition will follow if they are truly better.
I don't have a problem with the name Bitcoin Cash as such, I have a problem when the Bitcoin Cash crowd does everything in their power to take the "Bitcoin" name as in the OP so newcomers get confused and don't make their own choice, or they get heated when it's abbreviated "bcash." It's malicious and damaging to the community at large.
You don't see C++ trying to claim it's the "real C," or trying to abbreviate itself as "C," instead it stands on its own for people to make their own choices about, and I think that's completely fine.

Coinbase is an exchange in itself. It doesn't 'go off' anything. It's dictated entirely by people on coinbase buying and selling. On a very basic level, Mt.Gox or any of the other exchanges don't affect the price at Coinbase at all. How they end up affecting it is when people see that Coinbase is low compared to Mt.Gox and start buying on there.

The bitcoin wallet can be encrypted (and it should be!) using the standard dameon and client, so there is encryption code in the codebase.
The protocol, though, doesn't use encryption for anything, and I assume that's what you're talking about.

I'm young, and I invested recently in a whole bitcoin. It's gone pretty well so far, I've nearly doubled my money.

They literally can't. The whole point of bitcoin is that nobody can remove money from your account without your private key. And there's no way to make money aside from mining or sending it. Not the guy next door, not banks, not the NSA, not even Satoshi can touch it. That's what makes it secure.

A lot of the other programs either didn't present my balances as readily, had lag issues, or didn't support all of the trading symbols.

I actually had another look, it would seem that they haven't uploaded an Android app yet.
If you're on Linux though, the compile isn't prohibitively difficult if you've compiled a couple things before. In theory, you should be able to do all this even if it's your first time, but I haven't included the syntax for every command, so some of the git stuff you'd have to figure out.
You clone the GitHub of twister-core wherever you like. Then, you create the directory `~/.twister`. Switch to that directory, and clone the twister-html project into there as the folder `html`. Now switch back to the twister-core project, and then into the libtorrent folder. Run bootstrap.sh, and then run:
    ./configure --enable-logging --enable-debug --enable-dht
After that, I did `make &amp;&amp; sudo make install`, though I'm not sure if I actually had to. Then, switch back into the twister-core folder and run `qmake &amp;&amp; make`. Then you'll have the `twisterd` program, which can be started by running:
    ./twisterd -daemon -rpcuser=user -rpcpassword=pwd -rpcallowip=127.0.0.1
After that, it's running, and you can connect by clicking [here](
