Having joined in 2016, I can call myself a long time Bitcoin enthusiast. I started off with **Bitcoin Core**, and even though storing the ledger on my disk space was a bit of a hassle, overall things went perfectly fine.
That is, until the **Bitcoin Cash fork** in 2017, after which I gave up on the idea and switched to **Jaxx**. Overall, it was a significant improvement for me, as I began expanding my portfolio and diving into crypto again.
But last year **I somehow missed the BSV fork**. I thought it was too late to jump on that train, as Jaxx never supported it, and I didn’t bother looking elsewhere at the moment.
Recently I stumbled upon **Magnum**, a wallet that declares it can handle any fork claiming. So I decided to give a try but still emptied my BCH account beforehand, then imported the private key in Magnum and, **surprisingly, it worked!** I got my long awaited BSV and proceeded to claim a whole lot of other forks I didn't even know I could claim.
If you are a lazy bum like me and still haven’t done this, **it’s about time**. Just pick a wallet you trust that can do that for you, and be careful.
**P.S. If you can recommend any other wallets or services with such functionality, make sure to mention them in the comments, as I personally believe that people should know about it.**

Most coins fork from BTC, that's why I decided that this subreddit will be the most relevant, as more people will know about this possibility

Yes, I do not see the problem also, unexpected people reaction
Moreover, as I understand private keys are held in browser, they are not going anywhere

It's like all browser wallets work
I moved my btc because I was not sure in the wallet also, but private key gives access to past snapshots and it is still possible to get some fork coins (e.g. bch if you had some btc in Aug 2017)
