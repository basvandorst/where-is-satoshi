What is the easiest way to make sure my Ledger wallet is safer than straight from the box? TY
@_date: 2016-07-30 23:43:26
Oh sorry I misunderstood. I sent it to him from my Core and he was using (or trying to at least) Armory and Core, but he's not positive which wallet generated the address he sent me.

Yes, extraordinarily accurate. His work is amazing.

Of course I will. A Lannister Always...

Cool, I'll try that tomorrow. r/bitcoin is great, 10 mins and I already have a plan of attack, yesterday I was stumped and nearly gave up, especially as neither of us know anyone more adept at the tech than us personally atm. If we unleash those coins, you'll get some love for sure. It seems like an awful shame to lose that money when we are about to MOON :-)

Oh ok. That makes sense. I'll check it on his machine tomorrow and find out. He's a noob like me so I guess it was a 1st result on duckgo which is bitcoinarmory.com. So he might be using an obsolete version, that might be the problem so ?( and why it doesn't look like it was meshing with Core)?
@_date: 2016-07-30 23:27:29
He doesn't rightly remember. He thinks Armory, would it be a matter of syncing the wallets someway? He has the back up seed etc. Would the fact that he has the wallet on an external harddrive matter? thanks btw, A super fast response to my 1st reddit post.

I think the Armory he has is legit. I'll check when I see his machine tomorrow. Core is all synced up on both of our machines ( at least it was yesterday). You might have a point with Armory though, Doesn't it have to be linked some way to Core's blockchain? And maybe the fact that Armory isn't running of his laptops hard drive might be an issue?

That's great, thanks. He is coming over tomorrow morning and we'll give that a go. So basically if we retrieve the private keys and import them to blockchain.info the funds are accessible? As I said, he has the Armory seed saved, not sure about the passphrase. I'm not sure if he has the back ups for Core(probably though).

Thank you
@_date: 2016-07-30 23:47:00
Good stuff. He synced up Core and it did take many weeks (old Dell shitebox) Is there any way I can find out which wallet he used?(bar him remembering, 420 etc).
@_date: 2016-07-31 00:10:14
Will do. Thanking you for your advice so far, Brilliant stuff. You can sleep well tonight knowing you might have saved a fellow bitcoiner €100 pre moon.
