[Cryptocoin Charts]( has a visual representation of how much of each coin gets traded daily.
What I find so interesting is that Bitcoin, Litecoin, and Dogecoin are almost always the clear   and  respectively... though, is a rotating circle of one pump-and-dump after another. Darkcoin, Bitshares, Stellar, Ripple, HTMLCoin, you name it.
While I'm at it, what the fuck was HTMLCoin?

All right, so here's the assumptions that I'm making:
1. Cryptocurrency as a concept is not going anywhere, even if for some reason Bitcoin went to zero.
2. If a 51% attack took down Bitcoin, the bigger altcoins would be able to react in time to prevent the same thing from happening to them, at least in the short term.
3. If Bitcoin got taken down, my Litecoins and Dogecoins would initially drop in value due to the shaken confidence. However, in the long run all the people who were using Bitcoin would now be pursuing the next best cryptocurrency for the same benefits Bitcoin offered, and the value would rise accordingly.


I think the full effects of sidechains remain to be seen, but yes.

I think there's some truth to that. Litecoin has had a significantly higher trade volume than Bitcoin the past few weeks, thanks mostly to OKCoin in China. [Source](
Altcoins are also a hedge against Bitcoin ever suffering a 51% attack

It hits 5k, I cash out enough to pay my student loans and the taxes (both of which are denominated in dollars)
The rest, I let those fuckers ride

It's probably reasonable to assume that Bitcoin either goes to 100,000 or zero, without a lot of middle ground...it's pretty much going to be one or the other
 Selling enough to pay my debt at 5k is my threshold where I can live with the results either way.
If it goes to 100k, I'll still have 3/4 of them left and be a wealthy man. But if it drops to zero, I'll have still put myself way ahead in life by being debt fee.

Even if bitcoin somehow fell victim it doesn't automatically mean that lite, peer, or doge would automatically fall victim as well.
It's a hedge. Doesn't mean it's perfect, but it's also not having *all* of one's crypto eggs in one basket.

My hypothesis is that right now, all the big money is on the sidelines and being used to bid on the U.S. Marshals bitcoin auctions.
For example, at the last auction there was 14 bidders on roughly $13.4 million worth of bitcoin. Assuming the bids averaged out to the current market price and all the bidders bid on all of the coins*, that would work out to roughly $180-$200 million on the sidelines and waiting to enter the market.
If you were a whale playing with that kind of money, you're going to be playing the long game...waiting a few months for the next auction is nothing, and is a much easier way to acquire coins compared to buying it up little by little on the markets.
*Neither assumption is necessarily true, but probably close enough to give a rough-order-of-magnitude of where things are at.
