What? No...
Basically a bank got robbed. Does that mean cash or gold is now broken? Of course not. It just means the bank had a security breach.

Reused, you could access reddit accounts if you could cross referance from a recently hacked exchange, if people used the same passwords, and if passwords were in the clear in said exchange. 
Not really feeling it...

Redditor for 2 days.
@_date: 2016-08-15 12:15:01
But why the secrecy? 
@_date: 2016-08-14 08:34:48
My understanding is that this is not possible. If it were, then the number of mn would be huge. At the moment, a server costs around 5 usd to run, but nets around 25 usd per mo. My understanding of the protocol is that it accepts one unique mn per 1000 Dash holding. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 10:20:12
Dash literally solves all of these issues.
@_date: 2016-08-13 15:13:20
...or Dash, which has governance     determined by voting of holderw within the blockchain with a development budget from the blockchain.

The US volume if btc trading is irrelevant on the global stage now. China trades many millions per exchange per day, while the biggest in the US trades a few hundred thousand. 
What reddit trolls think is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 09:56:01
This is true for nearly all asset classes. 
@_date: 2016-08-13 15:32:32
It is not a pump post.  I only just learnt about it a few days ago, and thought the design was clever. Can you explain what you mean by premined and why it is bad?
@_date: 2016-08-18 21:45:17
Dash.org is owned by dash masternode conglomerate. Bitcoin.org is private.
@_date: 2016-08-17 17:24:11
Honestly, this is the stereotype that crypto has to rid itself of. It will happen eventually, but it is a little tragic at the moment. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 09:18:47
Dash solves many of the current dramas that are affecting btc now, and with decentralised governance, will probably continue to do so. Monero probably has a better privacy/anonymity solution currently, though. 
I see the future as btc as a stable, gold-like asset with slow transaction times, while dash with instant transactions and fungabilty can act as cash.

What is with the voldemort thing? What is this mystical yet unnameable sub?
@_date: 2016-08-13 16:22:46
Thanks. 
How many are premined? How can we know this? 
@_date: 2016-08-13 18:27:07
Dash does it by paying 45% to miners and 45% to masternodes (and 10% to budget propofol).
@_date: 2016-08-13 15:42:51
Is that not true of the first BTC folk? Does Satoshi not hold millions and millions in Btc?
@_date: 2016-08-03 19:31:38
@_date: 2016-08-15 13:12:54
Spooky. But why? What is the beef/backstory? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:40:08
This cannot work with a fresh address. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:38:35
Short answer: probably. From my understanding, they legally must liquidate or make you whole.
The exception would be if they argued that you were stolen from and not Bitfinex, but that is a hard sell given the socialised loss.
I look forward to be shown wrong here.
@_date: 2016-08-14 09:54:37
I don't understand what you mean here. What would the government do to who?
@_date: 2016-08-15 11:52:24
That i what i meant ��
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:08:55
Why mad?
@_date: 2016-08-15 14:21:15
Thanks for the reply. But surely banning all mention of them just gives some level of credence (justified or not) to whatever conspiracies they claim? 
@_date: 2016-08-04 09:00:34
For clarity: it you are not reversing, only blocking. The transaction will take 24 hours to process, with the destination visible. 
@_date: 2016-08-14 17:02:53
Which bot?
@_date: 2016-08-18 16:03:47
This is why bitcoin should integrate a distributed management model like Dash has, based off the blockchain. Dash used its budget proposals to buy Dash.org early on.
@_date: 2016-08-06 21:45:37
They are not filing though. 
@_date: 2016-08-15 09:19:52
You can always borrow then sell...
@_date: 2016-08-19 08:22:42
But that is true of any business website ever.
@_date: 2016-08-13 20:20:25
I am keen to learn more about these concerns. What are they?
