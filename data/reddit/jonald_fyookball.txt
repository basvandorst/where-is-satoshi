so far from what i've read , I like Oliver's proposal (I'm from the 'other side' of the debate).   Sounds like not all the stuff is ready today and that is a problem, but if the two sides could agree on a direction, it would be a wonderful thing.

and you don't think KYC will becoming to companies that run large LN hubs?

The faster a scalability solution is in place, the more likely this is to happen.  Time is against bitcoin because of competition.
@_date: 2017-04-15 00:58:22
link or it didnt happen
@_date: 2017-04-08 02:00:05
"Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted."  I guess no one should be promoting segwit then?
@_date: 2017-04-01 01:00:42
this is an april fools joke? good one
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:21:27
wasn't some of them posted here
@_date: 2017-04-11 16:44:45
right.  what some people might not understand is that the "soft" part of the fork only is meaningful IF there's no split (if the miners agree).       
@_date: 2017-04-26 18:06:03


Yet have more support from miners than those of core.
@_date: 2017-04-09 04:07:28
obviously it depends on the size of the dictionary you are using.  calculate the entropy with a simple calculation.  You need 2^128 or greater.
@_date: 2017-04-04 00:09:06
HF is inevitable though..even if we follow core roadmap completely, LN will need bigger blocks at some point.
@_date: 2017-04-15 15:56:25
segwits not so great, bigger blocks + flex trans to fix mallaebility would be fine. 
@_date: 2017-04-09 04:05:23
well it aint gonna happen without more TPS one way or another.  That's for damn sure.
@_date: 2017-04-09 04:01:11
only a complete nitwit would sell ALL their bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-04-07 04:36:05
I thought bitmain agreed to segwit if it included bigger blocks at the HK agreement.  But the core devs decided they didn't want to do bigger blocks after all?
@_date: 2017-04-04 18:02:49
do you understand how LN works?  It even says right in the whitepaper its going to need bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-04-21 20:36:02
@_date: 2017-04-20 04:13:53
I will never support the core developers or their roadmap, they have lost my trust and are even personally threatening me.  
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:53:57
how about not raising the blocksize even though LN needs it anyway and bitcoin marketshare is dissapearing faster than a set of rims at a puff daddy concert...now thats earth flat earth stupid!
@_date: 2017-04-06 18:17:16
so, all this time i've been against segwit for free , i could have been getting paid?  how do i sign up?
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:14:26
learn github
@_date: 2017-04-11 03:17:20
i hope you are joking.   The hope (for segwit supporters) is that the miners will fall in line before it activates.  There's no guarantee there won't be a divergence.  In fact, actually activating UASF without miner consensus will give good chances for a network split to happen.
@_date: 2017-04-02 16:30:47
can someone fix the the B at 348,377 its getting crazy.
@_date: 2017-04-12 20:20:54
I like that you give users the choice Thomas and also allow us to choose BU if there is a split.   I am a big fan of electrum and want to thank you for it, even though I do not think you should be supporting UASF.
@_date: 2017-05-14 13:27:02
...or we could just have bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-05-14 04:03:38
or F2Pool could signal BU.
@_date: 2017-05-11 01:32:06
The entire transaction including witness data appears to be over 8 kilobytes.
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:10:13
how i feel about rising price: 
@_date: 2017-05-14 04:22:21
so ive been told
@_date: 2017-05-14 23:34:18
how would bigger blocks contribute to miner centralization?  Mining is geographically centralized due to low costs for hardware and electricity, completely unrelated to blocksize.  
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:38:52
I agree.  Bitcoin's values comes from it being a payment network, not JUST store of value...and bitcoin has competition.... time to come together as a community, we have a NY agreement compromise with Segwit and 2mb...everyone wins! :)  
@_date: 2017-05-14 04:04:16
I want bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:08:40
There's basically 2 kinds: Bip39 (more common) and Electrum (the first).  I'm quite sure archives of both will be around forever.
@_date: 2017-06-11 05:38:14
The story doesn't make that much sense.  What college student ever spends $200 for 'unknown software'.  It's a great story though.
@_date: 2017-06-06 04:12:34
none that I know of. hire a cheap coder to make one.
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:53:37
coinbase sucks!!! you fucking assholes need to spend more than a nickel on customer service.  
@_date: 2017-06-01 16:36:04
coinbase hasn't gotten back to me for 2 weeks.
