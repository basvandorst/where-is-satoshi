BTC and LTC both encourage saving as they are both deflationary currencies.  Unlike fiat where your money is worth less tomorrow, on a flat timeline and factoring halvening both will be worth more.
That doesn’t mean they won’t be used to buy stuff.  It just means one will think that much harder about purchases.

I use coincards.ca. Have bought lots of amazon.ca gift cards with LTC, BTC’s little brother.

Great option for Canadians try Newton.co
Only on ios though.  They make money on the spreads, no fee trading
They do have a web app coming as well.  The IOS app is super slick, can connect directly to a CAD bank account, instant funding which can be traded for crypto (can't withdraw crypto until funds clear takes about 5 days but you can still trade), withdrawals back to CAD take about 24 hours on a business day, directly back to your bank account).
I've been using them for almost a year, it's been by far the easiest best option I've tried.
Spreads are slightly better than Shakepay too.

Try Newton.co
I’ve been using them for a few months and the IOS app is pretty awesome.  5 min to link a bank account with instant funding.

Wow that’s eerie

Newton.co is what I’ve been using.  You can link directly to your bank account.

I used BTMs for months but the fees are ridiculous.  Switched to Newton.co in November and haven’t looked back.  It’s a really solid option for Canadians ... it’s not an exchange it’s a brokerage so they make on the spreads.  No android app yet, but the IOS app is unbelievably slick.

Same.  I just converted from LTC.  LTC was VERY good to me and let me hit my BTC target in one go.  
Regardless I basically tripled up money that would have been doing nothing otherwise.

4 years right?

Rule of thumb.  If you have more than one months salary worth of crypto it’s time to get a hardware wallet.   Even software wallet is better than the exchange.   Personally I love Coolwallet S.  It allows you that mobile experience with far more security.

That's exactly how I feel.  Was just too young to catch the dot com train

I have a huge soft spot for LTC .. was my first coin in 2014.  To this day I still regret not loading up when it was $3 a coin.
Use case ... I’ve used LTC to purchase all kinds of stuff.  Network effect counts for something I think ... the only coin better imho is BTC.
