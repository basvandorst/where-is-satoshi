You'd be surprised.

It certainly is, especially with the volatility of bitcoin. I wouldn't recommend it for anyone who isn't an experienced trader. But for those who are it is a necessary tool. 
I'd love to trade bitcoin on a US-based, regulated exchange. That's why I'm excited about them coming to my state, but I simply can't make enough money for it to be worth my time without some leverage.

You can trade anywhere but I'd much prefer to keep my money inside the country. And the Coinbase Exchange is the most promising so far in the US. I stopped using their broker service once Circle came out, though.

You're technically right but when it comes to the btc market margin call = forced liquidation so the terms end up being used interchangeably, for better or worse.

There have been many times during this downtrend where you could have done the same exact thing with the charts (and people have). It doesn't mean jack shit.

There's nothing wrong with thanking the creator of a technology. Some of the replies might be cultish but I see nothing wrong with the original post.

Looks like a bug. The order book is deeper than that.

This is a bad idea as he keeps soft stops and doesn't broadcast exactly what he's doing as he's doing it. He also uses leverage. So not only will you fail at following him, you'll lose your shirt in the process. I think btc-e has a system that allows you to follow other traders automatically but I haven't looked into it.

Good to see you still around. Bought my first coins off you back in 2013.
@_date: 2015-04-22 21:03:55
Sorry, but everyone holding so the price goes up is not for the good of the whole. If everyone held, no one could realize any profits. Price doesn't mean anything if you can't cash out. Traders selling and buying to smooth out volatility and provide liquidity is for the good of the whole.
It takes several millions of dollars to move the price for any significant amount of time. I highly doubt you will be able to bring that amount of money into your scheme. There are already other groups of whales who will oppose you until you prove you have the ability to beat them.

It's both. You can only gain reputation if you use their escrow service, however. And for that they charge a fee.

Everything about this coming election makes me sick to my stomach. Seeing fellow bitcoiners endorse this guy for superficial reasons certainly doesn't make it any better.
But I guess it doesn't matter. You will all vote for the "lesser evil" and I'll write in who I actually want to be president which won't even get counted in my state. And then we'll meet the new boss, same as the old.

A blatant pump and dump literally just happened on Bitfinex with over 4K coins fyi.
@_date: 2015-04-28 08:08:16
It's not worth the risk. Bitcoin is a risky enough investment on its own. Don't expose yourself to the kind of risk that leaving those coins with someone else entails. 
@_date: 2015-04-21 20:34:43
Yes. Either through borrowing coins or futures trading.

Escrow service.

All you need is to have fiat on the exchange and then you make a limit buy order for the price and amount you want. Then if the market goes down and someone sells into it then you'll be buying their coins. 
To wire fiat to an exchange you'll have to jump through a few hoops but a lot of exchanges let you move btc in and out without going through that. So in order to move fiat with btc you'll just buy coin however you normally do it, then move it to the exchange and immediately sell it for fiat. Then you can place your bids.

Sometimes the whole point of commenting is to derail the discussion. Send a thread off in ten different directions and it makes it that much harder for people to access good information.

Not a good idea, but regardless, I hope you have the stomach to hold them and not sell at the bottom. I think it will pay off eventually but there will most likely be times of panic before then.

The volume's been good, though. It makes no sense to take the money and run when they have a steady stream of income.
Hopefully it's just a bug and everybody's funds are safe.
Edit: Looks like they are working on it:

It probably is fud but I don't think it's a bad idea to warn people of the dangers. Some people might see the high price on btc-e and decide to move some coins there without thinking about *why* the price is so high. 
Remember, the price on Mtgox was higher than every other exchange too.

Then y u heff to b mad? It all evens out in the end. Either bitcoin will boom or bust. What happens in between is just noise.
P.S. Hardly anyone complains when the price gets manipulated *up*.

Way to prove his point...
I think Jorge couldn't be more wrong in his opinions about the future of cryptocurrency but you can't act like bitcoin is a sure thing. Nothing is certain.
