As with every good thing there will be people lined up to abuse it.

Sounds like some of you need to diversify. No one should be putting more than they can afford to lose into crypto. I think there's a bright future for crypto currencies but they're all going to fluctuate a lot until it becomes as trusted as a reliable fiat currency from a developed country.

I forget who said Bitcoin is schmuck insurance. Well theres your top schmuck.

I think the bigger revelation will come when Bitcoin becomes the stable gold standard to which all other currencies will be measured. It likely won't happen till after most of the major world economies fail. Which may not be that far away.

The whole concept of a crypto bank is retarded. You have something that is inherently safe offline but your going to allow an institution to look after it.

Bitcoin will go to $420,420 by Dec 31st.

When people really start to believe in it more than they believe in the fiat currencies they presently convert it to.

It could easily be done. The fridges in RV’s use a  sealed system that converts heat into cooling with very few parts.

You can’t really. You could buy An ETF and trade it but it’s not real bitcoin.

True, but most refrigeration systems use a compressor. It would be relatively easy to modify a propane fridge to run off the heat from a mining rig.

Yeah, the people on that sub are hopeless. I've been wasting my time with them, I think.

Why is no one helping to defend bitcoin on r/futurology today?

Check out how an RV propane fridge works. It’s incredibly simple.

Congress does nothing for Bitcoin. It's appeal has always been its decentralized nature. Stop trying to make this about pleasing congress or governments and it's intrinsic value will be preserved by demand.

TBF he calls it a 2 day seminar to Blockchain programming. You need to know how to program already. He's  hyped it up, like you say, in some of his interviews though.

I think a lot of people would immediately buy if the price dipped lower than 6k. They would be crazy not to.

They should be coming down in price soon cause Nvidia made a lot of cards for miners which they can't sell now.

A lot of people are confused about this cause Roger Ver likes to tell stories to push his coins.

The real story is always in the comments. Edit: especially if you didn't read the article like myself.

If bitcoin skyrocketed in price, then a satoshi would be of a larger value as well because its a fraction of bitcoins value making it even more practical.

I do. XRP is centralized and new coins are created whenever Brad Garlinghouse wants to make more. I'm not saying the price won't go up in a bull run. I'm just saying I don't like the fundamentals of XRP. I like to stick with coins that have a Github presence. I'm not a maximalist by any means. I feel like almost any other coin in the top 10 would be a better choice.

It's hard to say whether not producing any coins beyond the 21M will drive the price up indefinitely. I know how supply and demand works but if whales buy up all the Bitcoin and completely cutoff trading to the point where there is no supply people could give up on it and just move to another coin especially if adoption hasn't taken place because nobody is moving any coins. These are just my thoughts, nobody's really talking about this.
