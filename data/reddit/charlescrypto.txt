U wot
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:31:31
Do fees count?
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:34:55
Allowing you to get in a block faster for the same price. So really it's an oxymoron in a way.
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:22:29
Soros is literally one of the worst people in the world.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:03:11
I concur 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:11:45
Could mean both. Double dillin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:01:28
Bigger and bigger block will mean people will need to have massive hard drive space in the future to run their nodes, they will also need huge Internet bandwidth. This will lead to nodes only being run by company's and will resemble severs or data centers. This will cause the bitcoin network to be partially centralised and for a DE-centralised currency that is just pathetic. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:53:54
Do you really believe there could be a "correction" all the way down to $1500? I really dont
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:49:28
he just seems like a really nice guy. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 22:02:26
And when they close exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:54:36
That timing! ��
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:41:53
You really need to get a grip. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:03:05
Sure you did..
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:26:48
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:29:17
Plz go back to btc, you're not needed here.
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:21:08
Unless you're in the south. It's so unfair :( 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:54:10
I'm not saying that Bitcoin will be a threat to the economy. I'm questioning the possibility of it being used as a scapegoat when the fiat all comes crumbling down. A blame game if you will.
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:40:47
In needed to stop or drop. The drop would of been far worse had it carried on climbing.
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:58:10
I don't get it.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:45:36
We're you born the same day that Einstein died? 
@_date: 2017-12-28 12:21:42
I've used coinomi quite a lot over the past year, it's a great wallet that supports many coins.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:21:29
less supply of bitcoin, more vendors accept it, btc atms all over the place, much bigger network, more miners means more secure network. Plz troll harder.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:02:12
It deserves it. I think it's massively undervalued compared to btc.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:15:27
lol okay mate.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:33:26
No need to bash litecoin. Bcash is fair enough tho. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:54:40
Andreas also helped me believe. The way he puts his points across is just magnificent. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:32:59
Where can I send this God of a man some of my bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:39:02
Hahahaa wtf
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:43:50
Yeah it's shit that the mem pool is so clogged but in times like this we can look at it like a safety feature
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:21:15
I see a unilad or ladbible post every few hours and they haven't got a clue what they are talking about. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:35:51
Oh really? But that's an average day in bitcoin. Surely that will mean trading will be stopped everyday? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:27:12
Please do it and post pics. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:21:30
Sitting here with my morning tea and bourbons waiting for that 10k. Yes boi.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:16:19
This never fails to brighten my day.

Human greed is endless. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 18:00:09
Just remember. This isn't meant to be just an investment. This is a revolutionary technology that's possibly the biggest thing since the Internet. Never forget that. It makes hodling much easier.
@_date: 2017-12-18 10:30:39
That's a bit below the belt..
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:47:58
Wtf 
@_date: 2017-12-18 12:44:13
I read the white paper and realised how much the world needs this system. It's power back to the people.
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:04:26
I was born and grew up in the midlands, I remember snow every year when I was younger. That's about all I miss about the midlands ��
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:28:16
This guy won a Nobel fucking prize. How?! ��
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:01:04
Troll harder plz
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:03:25
That's only worth bcash. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:30:34
It feels like only yesterday since we hit 9k. This is madness 
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:02:17
How can you not love her? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:45:18
Bigger blocks don't scale. How can you not understand this? 
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:31:31
I feel a weird sense of deja vu..
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:38:51
I've been a little down today watching the price going back down. But then I look at the growth for the last week/month and I realise I'm fine with this.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:11:21
I always assumed he had made plenty enough. I didn't realise he was working so hard that it ate up all his funds. I'm happy to pay him for the hard work he has done. He's a brilliant mind in a brilliant space. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:02:21
Facebook adoption and the rate at which household computers became the norm.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:37:49
Grow up. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:31:54
Tumble dryers are a bubble
@_date: 2017-12-06 10:21:45
Caught it well mate!
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:06:51
Yes, but he just debunked the idea that it would cost $100
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:10:43
Why would you use bcash when you can just use bitcoins little brother litecoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:19:09
I'd say a week or 2. But who knows? 
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:01:20
Conservative. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 17:19:58
I found it and sent 0.01 btc :) very well deserved.
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:38:39
Because they could long it and make good gains over time or they could short it, manipulate the price and make billions and billions in a very short time. But as people have stated it seems like there are restrictions in place to stop this. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:13:55
Because it feels awesome.
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:42:01
Markets like these are volatile and unpredictable. Run it for a month and see what you get. If you get 60% again it could be worth billions.
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:10:56
It's funny how old cars go up in value but new ones go down.
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:56:41
7% swing in either direction an trading stops. 7% in bitcoin is nothing. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:29:46
Ah okay! Well that's a step in the right direction 
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:25:48
I'm in Cardiff atm, I really thought we'd get it here.
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:12:19
I realise that debt isn't inherently bad, however when deficits are rising at the rate they are and gdp/growth is far lower in contrast, you can't sit back and say we aren't heading for a bad time. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:57:32
And just look at the price of btc compared to bch ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:14:44
Way bigger. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:32:23
+1 what's happening with the tax bill? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:35:55
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:23:04
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:25:17
I'm pretty sure those are old-school 
@_date: 2018-08-30 05:32:08
John Lennon was a fucking lemon.
@_date: 2018-05-16 13:31:04
That's fucking cool. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:06:48
Your weather says cumming dude. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:46:21
Oh shit, sorry. Why did you choose to write it in rust? 
@_date: 2017-11-19 07:57:10
100x more secure at least. I adore mine.
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:14:36
Redditor for 8 months. You're hardly a veteran.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:15:55
Just glance at the code you posted and realised it's python.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:47:51
The last 10 minutes almost had me crying with laughter.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:53:21
Or short it.. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:43:21
Teslalicious. Screw lambos. Musk is king, we really need him to get on the btc bandwagon. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:38:39
Most don't require that you give an ID but some will ask for one if you want higher amounts.
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:17:39
Hate it when that happens.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:49:50
But he was a millionaire way before bitcoin! GOD! 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:39:42
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:04:55
Good point
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:29:13
Yes.. point? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 18:46:47
Cool. You realise it really doesn't matter right? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:44:39
This makes me so angry.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:22:12
I didn't buy. I've brought plenty enough at much lower prices. Am I stupid? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:37:16
I guess you have a point. But it's really not my intention, just thought it was a funny meme about the bcrash shitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:00:26
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:46:44
Not everyone is a shill dude, ease off.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:11:02
I couldn't believe he was actually saying it. Does he not realise how harmful that is to a "decentralised" currency? Moron.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:17:14
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:51:43
This gave me a great laugh. Thank you sir.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:02:28
Yeah... someone posting a meme calling bcash shit is obviously a bcash shill.... are you alright mate? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:40:15
I wish he did. It would be the cherry on the cake for the bull run week.
@_date: 2017-11-25 13:31:35
Yeah that's exactly what I'm thinking. If it goes over 10k people will think "this is unstoppable" and mass fomo will occur. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:25:00
Are you mad?
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:02:50
I reckon that would do it you know.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:44:58
The last 10 minutes had me almost crying with laughter. The ultimate way to troll is to just give facts. Roger is such a prick.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:38:16
That's what I thought! I'll get right on setting it up! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:39:45
You'd need to be mad to short btc lol. Or know some very important information.
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:49:12
I hate stereotyping but I was close to going out shooting today with my spaniels and a bunch of lads.
@_date: 2017-11-18 13:14:51
What language is it programmed in?
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:28:29
The global reserve is not USD it's BTC
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:05:48
And one hell of a lot of them.
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:09:54
I agree. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:37:24
Yeah man! I feel like us brits are just in a corner looking at different checkpoints to the rest of this sub.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:18:39
I'm trying to find the video to this, has anyone got a link? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:35:42
You'll get hurt.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:00:06
Hahaha he's just pathetic.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:31:20
Surely there's some fucked up super rich bankers that would pay to see this? That's the kind of stuff they do isn't it? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:53:57
You realise it would cost 10.00 to send 1000000 on bitcoin right? Size or the transaction doesn't really matter
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:17:11
It feels good man. Me and my friend are just talking about it 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:51:04
This is why I love my Trezor. "Where is it? I want to give it a kiss."
@_date: 2017-11-24 19:29:08
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:34:55
Bitcoin ticker is being weird for me
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:35:04
I was just going to say that. It sounds like something that roger would do. We should start a donation pool for the lightning network and development. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:26:09
I'd buy that, frame it and then hodl it.
@_date: 2017-11-25 22:30:02
Never go full retard.
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:40:13
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:06:28
I literally have no idea what that is. Can you stop trying to be so edgy?
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:53:58
Is someone wanting to buy the dip? ;) 
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:10:44
How's it going? 
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:36:20
Should we start an ICO or maybe fork bitcoin to do this? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:30:46
If there is one let me know as well...
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:23:22
Because it's going to go over 9000!!!!!!
@_date: 2017-11-27 22:27:16
Watch the last 10 minutes that's when it gets hilarious.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:27:55
I'm just reading the idea behind it and it could be quite ground breaking. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:56:14
That's fair. Fuck him.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:55:43
Bitcoin might make no nut November quite difficult.
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:02:08
Gave me a good giggle.
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:05:54
Any updates on mimblewimble? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:19:51
By or over the weekend! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:09:17
But not a dick. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:52:14
You realise we made you right? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:32:42
This could actually be a very good case for regulation.
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:24:48
Self flying tesla? 
@_date: 2018-02-04 16:36:17
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:32:14
I love this man do much that words can't even describe.
