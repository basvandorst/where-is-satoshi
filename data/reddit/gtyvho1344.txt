Your defense of crypto currency is “Jesus”?
The Iran sanctions and the Cuban sanctions where national news at the time they occurred, just because you where busy playing video games does not mean adults where not paying attention 
Most people are idiots and they should not be in charge of monetary policy- if you lack the education or ability to figure out how to buy and sell things internationally then you probably should not be engaging in international financial transactions

People like me, lawyers who work in finance, you know?  Adults who actually understand how fucking economics work and we don’t just respond with the word “hodl” to every god damn thing

2 days, 2 hundred years- it’s still true 
Bitcoin was designed for crime 
That’s why there is so much excitement for Monero- it’s better at crime 
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:31:19
That’s a complete lie 
The Chinese lend 42 trillion dollars a year 
If they switched to being backed by gold then gold would be worth millions an ounce overnight to match the value of outstanding debt, it would also give way to much political power to gold holding countries that are not china- which is the opposite of Chinese monetary policy 
Will never happen 
@_date: 2018-03-22 23:01:55
So your responses to my questions are- read atlas shrug, poor people can suck it, lending is stupid, if you don’t personally approve of an economic project it should not exist, and you can’t wait to be a criminal 
Yup- you sound exactly like who should be making the economic decisions of the fucking world 
The entire world should surrender their growing wealth and better standard of living so YOU a white fuck in America can feel better- how about no? How about adopt change or die bitch?
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:24:36
You can literally do both of those things now 
The sanctions are off both those countries 
@_date: 2018-03-23 21:56:54
No, you just don’t have a fucking answer 
Bitcoin can’t replace central banking 
Your boss can’t pay you in money that he himself is not being issued because it is not being exchanged 
That’s not how economics works 
@_date: 2018-03-20 23:33:11
Deflect all you want, Bitcoin was made as a method to buy child porn and drugs 
We all know it, that’s why there was not a lot of early adopters 
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:20:37
The Chinese central bank lends 42 trillion dollars a year- that money is needed to maintain the country 
How the fuck is bitcoin going to build high speed rail lines and open accessible credit for nearly 2 billion people?
Just say hodl and fuck off, you have no idea how macro economics works 
@_date: 2018-03-23 03:48:35
Does not seem likely that a digital investment platform will end the Chinese central bank 
Why don’t you explain that to me
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:45:08
I am not wrong and technically you agreed with me that everyone is just holding it and refusing to use it as a means of exchange, which makes it just an investment device whose value is based in fiat 
If your economic model is “eventually” then is a stupid fucking model, bitcoin should be used right now for exchanging goods and services if it is the superior method- but it’s not- no one actually wants to trade in it, just hold it for an eventual cash out in fiat 
That’s not how money works 
@_date: 2018-03-22 07:19:31
Currently no one is USING bitcoin for anything- it’s just an investment vehicle 
It’s also traceable and you have to pay both income tax and capital gains tax on it- so it is not exactly independent from our banking system 
I think our current global financial system is great! Education has never been easier to obtain, costs of goods are at all time lows, energy is very cheap, people have easy  to credit and lending- seems to be working great 
The only people I hear complaining are Americans because their wages have been in decline the last 30 years while the rest of the worlds have been going up- and that’s been mostly do to bad domestic spending choices- not currency policy 
The US dollar is actually very over valued, slight inflation would be of tremendous benefit to most Americans since the have zero savings and tons of debt- inflation benefits debt holders so people in student debt and fixed mortgage debts would experience tremendous windfalls if their salaries also increased with inflation 
That would be good monetary policy at the moment 
Buying digital tokens in the hope that they gain in value is not a monetary policy, it’s an investment in a product you hope makes money- it may or it may not- but it has nothing to do with core economics 
Edit- additionally I take umbrage at you calling all law dishonest, just because you don’t understand how law works does not make it dishonest- you have the ability to educate yourself just like I have, you choose to be ignorant and invest your hopes in a product instead of your own abilities 
I am not reliant on bitcoin succeeding or failing- I am rich because I worked hard and understand the system and have taken advantage of the global market we now live in
You prefer to live in fear reading the Bible- again, that a choice!
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:47:31
Yes, and Friedman also agrees consumption is essential to economic growth 
With bitcoin there is no consumption because it’s not exchanged for anything- it’s just an investment device for fiat 
Till it is a legitimate tool to buy and sell goods and services it doesn’t mean shit- it might make a few people rich like any other product but it is not a fundamental change to the economy

You can get dollars with an internet connection......

You don’t BUY currency 
Currency is earned in exchange for goods and services- so that means we need a method of actually using the fucking bitcoins as a medium of direct exchange 
Currently that does not exist- no one gets paid in bitcoins because 1) you fucks just hodl and 2) the volatility of the coin makes it not reliable as a base salary 3) its whole value is based on its exchange for fiat 
@_date: 2018-03-22 01:31:08
So tomorrow? A year? Ten years? 50 years?
You tell me when you think china will abandon control over its own currency to a digital currency controlled by western powers? 
Keeping in mind that it is already to illegal to posses crypto in china and chairman Xii described bitcoin as a “western tool for the dissemination of drugs and child pornographers”-the guy they just made PRESIDENT FOR LIFE!
Yeah, I bet he can’t wait to just give up control of his economy and end the one belt one road so you can get a Lamborghini 
Makes total sense! The entire country is just going to- we don’t need to keep investing in high speed rail and climate change technology that requires 40 TRILLION DOLLARS A YEAR IN INVESTMENT
YOU!  The bitcoin hodler!!!!! Will gladly invest their bitcoins in projects you don’t understand in cities you can’t find on a map for people you don’t give a fuck about!
How could I be so blind!

Gold was used for a variety of reasons before banking- it was often the source of the literal coinage made by priesthood’s or governments- but we where able to exchange it for goods and services 
Gold was also used primarily as a decorative device for jewelry and sculptures- this led to its culture importance in the first place �� 
Bitcoin right now has no consumption use- it’s just an investment store till it is exchanged for fiat- I don’t think most users would actually part with there bitcoins in exchange for goods or services even if an easy method offered itself to be available since it is being so strongly pushed as just an investment tool
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:30:19
Ok, explain how bitcoin will subsidize the construction of high speed rail?
How will bitcoin allow people to buy and sell homes?
Will bitcoin all lending? Will we be able to BORROW against a bitcoin? If so how? If not why not?
Who decides any of these things?
Who gives the bitcoin to the guy starting a business if he has no bitcoin if all bitcoin are held by the current adopters and there is no fiat? Where does that money come from?
Do we now just have a new digital currency BACKED in bitcoin but is not actually the bitcoin? Essentially a gold standard? If so why? What has actually been achieved and who is regulating its value? 
What legal entities are preventing the seizure of bitcoins like the seizure of gold? Or the use of bitcoins to be punishable by death? Having a bitcoin mining rig in china already will get you sent to prison so why not executed?
What is to stop the IMF or the bank of settlements from declaring all bitcoin or crypto transactions completely illegal- bitcoin is traceable and do is most crypto- nothing really stoping that
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:17:29
Anything from before the last national conference is just pointless, Xii is now president for life and monetary policy is following OBOR
The Chinese central bank lends 42 Trillion dollars a year- every year 
The entire crypto market cap is 800 billion dollars- it’s a drop in the bucket 
@_date: 2018-03-22 07:54:42
You don’t understand what consumption means 
Bitcoins need to be used for goods and services to justify the value and cause growth in the actual economy 
Bitcoin is JUST A DATABASE OF BITCOIN- it’s only value is the value we give that database in fiat dollars- it is not something that we use to do anything with in the larger economy 
I can’t just choose to use bitcoin instead of visa or MasterCard- which BTW would make sense if I could since they are just merchant credit systems- but bitcoin is not adopted in that manner or in any manner allowing actual use
So currently it is just a store of value 
@_date: 2018-03-22 04:24:08
Bitcoin is primarily held for its value, then exchanged for fiat- that is not positive consumption- that’s just net investment 
@_date: 2018-03-21 23:26:30
You sound poor 
@_date: 2018-04-05 14:57:18
I will be holding my gold 
Explain to me how crypto will end the central bank of china- a bank that lends 42 trillion dollars a year while all crypto is 800billion and bitcoin has already been made illegal in China with a death penalty for having an active crypto wallet inside of the mainland 
How is it going to overthrow chairman Xii?
@_date: 2018-04-03 23:46:34
I have been buying gold
Going great, see you when bitcoin is illegal

So everything you have said is wrong including the analogy you just used 
You have not described a currency transaction of an early economy, you described the “coincidence of wants”- where you have mammoth and I have fish and we barter in our small economy because we both want it
Money evolved specifically to deal with the issues that arise when one of the parties in this situation does not have anything the other party wants, hence a third thing that both parties agree has value, money 
Additionally Bitcoin is not a deflationary currency, it is an inflationary asset- bitcoin has none of the characteristics of a currency and all of the volatility of a good- it is most similar to other inflationary and volition goods such as energy or food commodity which often have high spikes in value affected by supply and demand 
Bitcoin’s supply and demand curve has been linked to its rising investment value, not an increase in its reliability or availability- bitcoin is actually being further and further restricted in more and more regions- but its high investment value and investment potential is driving in new investment 
- this is traditionally revered to in many ways as a pyramid scheme or Ponzi scheme since most bitcoins are owned by a very small amount of owners who have the ability to cash out and effect the prices 
We have seen this throughout 2018 
Regardless you do whatever you like, I am not saying bitcoin will not and has not made people rich- like any criminal enterprise it has the potential to reap rewards for people involved
In the future I see bitcoin being further banned and controlled as the situation continues to escalate
