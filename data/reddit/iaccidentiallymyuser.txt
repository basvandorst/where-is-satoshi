This kind of trivial bullshit is surely no matter for Get your facts straight. Because YOU are the one advocating a solution where the password HAS to be stored in plaintext on the server.
EDIT: deleted the parent comments while I was typing a reply. So I'm posting it here.
Just wanted to correct my last statement a bit. 
Sure, it does not mean that you HAVE to save it in cleartext. You could of course have ment to "hash on client" AND "hash on server". 
Problem: if you're doing this because you're not trusting your TLS it won't make any difference. Thus adding unnecessary complexity.

Was already linked in another comment. It's a different address...

Dude... Where do you see any indication that sending the password unhashed means it is stored on the server in plaintext?
You're wrong and you should reconsider what you wrote multiple times. Examples:




So... you're saying that any website with reasonable security in mind is storing their passwords in plaintext?
Like google, paypal and facebook? They're sending the password in cleartext over an encrypted connection.
What is your point? Hash on the client and send that?? It would make things *worse* not better...

Exactly. My biggest issue with "webapps" that are constructed in this insane way are the access logs. Oozing out tons of logins everywhere on each and every access-log :(

Oh just read another comment of yours. No need to answer. 


Tagged you accordingly to save me some time in the future.

There is also no reason to hash it on the client side and use the client supplied hash on the server to check if it's equal to the stored hash.
Actually this would be very dumb. Consider a data-leak on the server side. No need to crack hashes. Just call the login-target with them.
It would be similar to using password-authentication and storing the PW in plaintext on the server side.

It's OK (provided you mean hashing with a unique salt!)
There's a lot of additional stuff that can be used today.
 - Flagging the session cookie "httponly" and "secure"
 - Sending a header to support [HSTS](
Also, I would advise to use [scrypt]( (if practical; it's memory intensive) or alternatively [bcrypt]( for the actual hashing of the password.
