Ok now thats cool. Thank you for explaining this. 
Edit: one more question. How long does the payment process take? is it like the transfer process takes 20 minutes or is it instant

I was thinking how does the business owner handle pricing his goods in bitcoin. Meaning if a sandwich costs $10 which is .00235 BTC as of today, does the shop owner have to keep switching his BTC pricing in live time to reflect the $10 value everyday?

So shop owner have to keep updating his BTC pricing in real time all the time? I just want to understand the exchange process between shop and consumers

So how does this work? Does the price of a sandwich fluctuate with bitcoin prices?

I'm new to Bitcoin and I dont beleive bitcoin is capable of any of the hype you guys are talking about. 1) theres isnt enought money for others to get in (only 16 mill and the rest is spread out on 120 year span). 2) its too slow and complicated for everyday transactions. Please explain to me if I'm wrong.

yeah I figured but I'm not worried about prices as much as actually making sure that coinbase is a good exchange and a bitcoin wallet. Any recommendations on a better trading platform or a better setup to store my bitcoins? A Lot of the exchanges are asking for an SSN and I don't have one. I only bought today because my Dad was asking about which confirmed to me that its going mainstream.

Of course I bought my first bitcoin at $2781. Waiting for Coinbase 8 day confirmation. Can I still cancel it since its not immediate transaction or I'm stuck with a very expensive purchase?
