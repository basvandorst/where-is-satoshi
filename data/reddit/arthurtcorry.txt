We are setting up operations on Grand Cayman in a physical office. It's close to the beach :)

Get a team together. Build a prototype. Apply. We are here to help talent form teams and startup up.

This is why we are taking the conservative approach of not dealing with any bitcoin or crypto-currency exchange directly. We are here to help blockchain technology ventures develop fintech, and everything else that can grow from blockchain and DApps. It is also our view, that bitcoin does not need a 'friendly jurisdiction'. Bitcoin by it's very nature is without jurisdiction and it certainly does not need us. Blockchain tech and DApps however, are in their nascent phases. Mass adoption of these apps needs the mentorship that already exists in the startup world and in the financial industry. This is what we're connecting new ventures to in the ultimate safe haven for startup.

This will not be the outcome of what we are creating in the Cayman Islands. We are creating a safe haven and the ultimate environment for innovative blockchain ventures to launch their startups internationally. Although we provide banking services for our ventures, there will be no cryptocurrency exchange via the Cayman Islands. All exchange must exist and comply to the various regulatory environments around the world in which those ventures operate. We provide a starting place. The ultimate starting place.

We have safeguards in-place to ensure this will not be the case.

That is correct OCPetrus, but you can also feel free to reach out to us personally for help in getting that all together. We are here to help talent get to the place where they are ready to enter an accelerator program.

I will tell him you said that.
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:38:58
There are reasons behind that which we are addressing. We are complying with all international regulations in order to bring the blockchain sector together with thought-leading multinational financial industry professionals. There are concessions needed on both sides in order to make the discussions at the summit a reality.

OH it's really not that sad when you consider the big picture.

We will be providing investment capital, but as you stated correctly, you must have enough funds saved for groceries and rent and a little travel for 3 months at least. We will provide airline discounts. Investment capital is not intended to be spent on groceries. Founders should have a buffer of funds allowing them to last at least 3 months, ideally more.

Hi all, I am the co-founder of this project in partnership with the CEC which is actually called Latitude 19.30 N, and you can learn more at  Our first effort is the 1st International Blockchain Summit. To correct an error in this posting, we will not be dealing with high frequency trading or any trading or any business directly related to monies made via currency exchange. Our sole and dedicated focus is to provide a safe and protected environment for blockchain software development ventures to start up. We also will provide these ventures with investment capital, and a 3 month accelerator program of structuring and due diligence, as well as introducing them to perhaps the ultimate fintech network on Earth, out of the Cayman Islands. The Cayman Islands have a population of 50,000 yet Georgetown, Grand Cayman is the 5th largest financial centre on Earth. The Special Economic Zone of the Cayman Islands was created to help I.P. be protected and for ventures to start up in a tax neutral and safe regulatory environment. I have dedicated my life to this as I believe it to be the answer to how blockchain tech can be fostered in an environment, perfect for global launches. After a startup period with optimum support and structuring in Cayman, ventures can then launch into the various complex and difficult to negotiate regulatory environments around the world and deal with challenges as they face them iteratively. Having been a pioneer in the startup accelerator industry with a focus on digital currencies and a passion for blockchain tech, I know what's needed and we are creating it with a very conservative approach, that will allow software development ventures to connect, not only with talent and innovators from around the world, but also industry leaders in the financial industry. Please feel free to email me if you would like more information. Arthur

The value we provide starts at that phase in a venture's development. Accelerators take an average 99% failure rate for startup ventures and turn that into a 65% success rate. This is the value we provide. Having been an unsupported startup founder myself in the past, in hind-sight, I know that what I lacked in my first ventures was mentorship, investment, and the support of established networks. The apprentice and mentor model has existed since the beginning of human history. Talent in this space, like to go it alone as they are generally independent thinkers. Once you involve other stakeholders, users, customers, you must take a more humble approach and realize that there is much that can come from the wisdom of experience and support given by senior mentors and investors. That is the value we bring to rouge talent. Not every venture needs an accelerator. We are there for the ones that do not have these support systems in place. It is key.

I must second that. We are creating a safe haven of transparency where blockchain ventures can innovate not only fintech but all other apps cross-sector without persecution.  
@_date: 2014-12-22 19:06:38
We have partnership build to provide you with the visas and work permits, health care and more that you will need. It is all included.

Hello Odal_limbs. I am the co-founder. We are not creating a self-sufficient bitcoin economy. We are creating the ultimate startup environment from a regulatory and financial and geo-political perspective from which blockchain and DApp software development ventures can launch. There will be no currency exchange. That is how we are able to create such an interface where the new and old financial systems can work in synergy to help each other create innovation. This is truly a world first accomplishment. Personally, I think the bitcoin economy is already self sufficient. What I see as being needed is further development of various blockchain technologies in order to make them more adopted by the masses. I hope to help steer the financial industry towards adaption and adoption of blockchain tech, rather than seeing it go in the same direction that the old music industry took, which essentially lead to the old music industry players destruction in attempting to fight decentralizing peer2peer tech. Blockchain tech needs forward thinking industry mentors and senior experts to guide it towards what it can become.

This is correct, and are necessary prerequisites for any startup in order to secure investment capital. We see the lack of such preparation in the blockchain sector as one of the problems with such new community. These steps work and are proven though VC due diligence since the beginning of Silicon Valley.
