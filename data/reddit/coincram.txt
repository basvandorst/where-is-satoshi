Hello. I'm further down the rabbit hole..run your own full node.

My point is that if the code was the problem you should help to contribute to it to make it better as many of us do. If the user experience is the problem...then same thing. Also for those who tend to shy away......breaking it down to how it does what it does helps adoption. 
Many people sit around complaining about free and open source projects that take pull requests from anyone in the world. That's not the way this works.

Youth is an irredeemable asset. Make your money, and live your life to the fullest. The USD as a world reserve currency was a cool experiment...it wont last. Stack you some sats and get some love on as many continents as you can while your young. Education is free (in exchange for curiosity). 360 degrees of knowledge is waiting for you...so you flunked out of having to pay an absurd amount in exchange for 1 degree of it? Godspeed.
@_date: 2019-11-05 00:12:38
Ledger is a cold key storage solution..your node wallet is always online by definition and hot....well warm at minimum. So the setup makes total sense. Development in the space is going toward letting users choose of they want to bootstrap onto the network or only to their own full nodes. This is a more secure way to transact. To not trust but verify. Running a local block explorer will be next so your not always plugging your txids and addresses into a 3rd party site for verification and search. 
Btw...stop using your node wallet. Not good.
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:13:37
Do your own research. Only way to be sure.
@_date: 2019-11-04 19:24:25
Lets keep it simple. Proof of keys is a day when you take any balance to ZERO on ANY account you don't hold the private keys to. Transfer ALL of your BTC to your own wallet.

@_date: 2019-11-05 02:34:25
I'm that dude. I was suggesting not to use your node wallet...as it is hot...vs your ledger wallet..which is a cold storage wallet.

That's not a bug. It's a feature.
@_date: 2019-11-20 15:09:05
It's complex at code level...but the tech is not that complex. Opening a channel is a multisig transaction. All the transactions within that channel are bundled off chain until the channel is closed. Then each participant is made whole.

U can do it. And it has been done. Dash. Lite coin etc are all bitcoin forks...u can fork the code and make minor tweaks and have your own coin. Easily. U will have a different Genesis block hash of course

@_date: 2019-10-29 16:39:02
If your not buying alot..defer the "anonymous" part till later. First learn how to buy or earn some btc and send to one of your copay wallet addresses. Try an atm or cash app. After you have done this successfully, continue your learning and work on anonymizing your holdings. That said...
If u absolutely positively got to buy bitcoin anonymously...get it from a private seller. But that further up the learning curve also.
Also...get rid of copay..and get greenwallet instead.
@_date: 2019-10-24 07:39:03
Upload your ID and u get a real.bitcoin address to withdraw from and send to. Still.not your keys...but a bit smoother on/off load experience..

Some aspects (the important ones) are immutable(confirmed blockchain transactions), and some are not. BTC is a living thing similar to a sewer rat. It has a very strong immune system that can handle many things. Check out the evolution of the various BIPs (Bitcoin Improvement Protocols) and see how this living thing adapts and mutates to survive and maintain its soul...which is to be permission-less, trust-less, and scarce.
@_date: 2019-10-02 02:19:06
No. I'm not.

@_date: 2019-10-30 11:33:40
Agreed. It's a lazy way. The higher the educated user...the less ledger has to be relied upon and the device just becomes a transaction signer.
@_date: 2019-10-30 11:18:42
You don't need to unlock  your device everytime on Ledger Live. Just click "Don't have your device?" At bottom. It'd not best practice but safe especially if you only have one ledger device your xpub is solo.
