idk if i needed help, i was just looking for an explanation of how that's a funny joke or referential reference in this sub. seems just sort of pejorative
@_date: 2017-09-05 12:28:51
how about $100 every 10 days to save on transaction fees?  jk good stuff

you seem committed, good for you

I didn't think the poster was being that poetic, maybe i dont understand the purpose of the sub\
seems like a pretty dumb comparison to make, there will be vulns found in the blockchain eventually, there's no way to synthesize gold though, not yet at least? maybe it is a good analogy/ metaphor. i don't know, im not a chemist

any key that takes an eternity to deduce now will probably(read ideally) be dust in a decade, but then again gold might suddenly become replicatable. I hope i have the computer that cracks it because $71B useless currency sounds nice anyways
I agree crypto currency and proof of work is the way to go but i think btc itself is a bit of a temporary commodity in and of itself. if not, hey. Im glad im invested. im just not fully converted.

where are you getting $5 ounces of gold? I can't even get an ounce of jager at a bar for that 
@_date: 2017-10-06 00:49:27
yes, and?
@_date: 2017-10-06 01:14:48
yes, right. Because the USD will experience hyper-deflation. makes perfect sense. /s 
i think this community is a bit too focused on its memes and not serious at all to relating to reality or actual terms or models for things. maybe im just in the wrong sub for reading about crypto currency, this place reads more like the_don but for funny internet money

IRK, bars are charging absurd amounts for simple liquors 
anyways, im pretty convinced this is the r/drankthekoolaid sub, found btc and they seem more reasonable. have fun with your stuff though.
