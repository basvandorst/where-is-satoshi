Sorry, but oxo-xox-oxo is actually correct here. Supply and demand controls all markets, regardless of the asset or derivative attached to it. Fundamentals help with supply/demand shifts, but the current market is always based on supply/demand of that asset at that moment.  
'HODL'ing helps reduce the supply side if you don't give in to market fear and truly HODL, but it does not increase demand. Fundamentals/News help demand. Then finally, usage helps currency velocity and stock-to-flow.

"I’m going to be rude but fuck you and your shitty stock trading background."
"What the fuck are you talking about and how is this relating to what I’m saying? You’re being a cunt and cherry picking comments I made on this thread and stating “sure I’ll pick this one here to call him out on”"
Yes, that's generally how a debate works, although this has been more of a lesson, than a debate. But if you'd prefer, I don't mind /not/ cherry-picking and calling you out on your entire post.
"Yes, I understand gold and it’s history. I’ll take your lack of understanding one step further and say that gold became outdated as a medium of exchange due to the industrial revolution because it was inefficient in keeping up with the speed of commerce. Given the new technologies that were emerging. Adoption of fiat and checking in banking was a huge innovation to fit the needs of the era."
Fiat was not just 'implemented' as a great new innovation as you so eloquently describe. They were originally printed by individual banks and were used as a certificate to redeem for gold from the bank that printed it. It was easier to trade the more common and trusted bank notes back and forth instead of redeeming them, so that became the norm after a time.

 "Profitable, only I own more than you. I don’t day trade, so good luck on that."  
You don't know how much I own, but if I had to bet on your BTC stack vs. mine based on the content of your posts, I'd take the under.  
"I get price discovery, you’re too fucking stupid to understand that."  
Except you never once used that term until I mentioned it in my post.   
"Everyone in this thread is on groupthink, like you."  
Or you're wrong and everyone is trying to help you not look like a dummy but you just. keep. making. it. worse.

Not trying to be rude, but your arguments look very elementary to someone who actually understands the underlying causes of price appreciation and depreciation. Arguing your point and not even trying to understand what everyone else is trying to teach you makes you look ignorant and deluded. You have clearly made up your mind on your theory, regardless of if it is wrong (which it is).
Gold is very rarely, if ever, used as money today. It is heavy, cumbersome, difficult to divide, and not very good at 'being money', yet people have used it for thousands of years as a store of value and a medium of exchange. We do not use it as a medium of exchange today because it is easier to exchange fiat, but it still is a store of value in a similar way as Bitcoin. Usage helps adoption through increased currency velocity and liquidity, but it is not the only factor when determining price.
Day-trading absolutely affects the price as it is happening. It is literally what moves the markets intra-day. Without trades, the price doesn't move. Doesn't matter what time frame those trades are in. This is also why Bitcoins price is different on multiple exchanges. The supply/demand is going to differ based on the users of that platform. (It creates great arbitrage trading opportunities if you know how). Third, the price has nothing to do with whether the transaction is 'on the blockchain' or not. It's all about who's willing to buy at the current price and who's willing to sell at the current price. When sellers outweigh buyers, price goes down. When buyers outweigh sellers, price goes up. That's it.

Yes, I read the entire thread multiple times, including your 'theory' on how markets work. I feel like my IQ has dropped a few points because of it.
You may know 'a thing or two' about price discovery, but I have a very clear, fundamental understanding of it and I'm telling you (along with everyone else in this thread) that your 'theory' is wrong. I don't care if you flipped a few pennies on a biotech 'back in your day'. 
The only one spreading misinformation in this thread is you. Stop it and read 'a book or two' on finance, capital flow, and basic economics.

Not supply and demand vs. anything.  
Supply vs. Demand.  
I did read the entire thread, and it's pretty clear that you understand very little of what you are talking about and have made up a decent bit of stuff to fill in the blanks where your knowledge is lacking.  
Pretty much everyone in the comments of this thread has a general understanding of how price discovery works except you. But keep arguing with everyone you think is wrong. People like you are what make the markets profitable for people like me. :)

I can attest to this. Bitcoin is the greatest thing I didn't invest in earlier.

"Who else has this much faith in crypto, and that much lack of faith in fiat?"  
Me. I did the same thing. I'm now about to sell my rental property and put a nice chunk of it into BTC to add to my stack. Still holding onto a ton of fiat debt. Once you devote your entire life to researching everything you can about economics, stocks, investing, savings, budgeting, etc, it doesn't take THAT long to understand that BTC is the only way out of this mess. I'm quite literally scared into BTC as soon as I get fiat in hand.

Hold onto your coins. Give it a few more years and pretend your portfolio doesn't exist. Rebuild what wealth you can for the short term and enjoy knowing that you own a peice of the future and will be rewarded handsomely once day. If you're feeling down about it and can't get away, do some research. Learn and be confident in your initial reasoning for the investment, despite current sentiment.

Lol. Just like when they called it dead in 2009, right? And 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017.
