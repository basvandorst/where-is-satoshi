Excellent example of context and reasoning that op doesn't realize he/she's missing.

You haven’t fully thought through your analogy. You are assuming those traders live in an unlimited ecosystem of wealth and resources.
Your are describing delusion, not economic theory.

Why? Why would you sell bitcoin to a relative instead of letting them do it on an exchange? Be very very careful as you are now considered money transfer agent which comes with strict regulation and filings.

Can you please explain what you think technically happens when crypto “absorbs” 1/8 of global stocks, bonds, and real estate assets? In simple terms, what is the process of those assets being converted into bitcoin?

So you're saying you believe Bitcoin's market cap will be over $22 trillion dollars, and the Winklevoss bros will be worth $150 billion dollars by the end of 2020?

Good, you're starting to dig deeper to gather more context. Now look at the total crypto market, if Bitcoin were to hit $1 million by 2020 then the market cap for the entire crypto market would be $55 trillion dollars. Is it reasonably possible that people will sell $55 trillion dollars of their current assets and trade them in for a cryptocurrency, especially in two years?

My statement had more to do with "context" and how realistic those two statements are given the limited supply of wealth in the world.

Yikes, you can't even follow a one sentence argument without mixing up values. I understand now.
