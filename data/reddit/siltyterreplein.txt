With or without wash trades ?

Because if you google XRP or Ripple Reddit links come up fairly high on the search return and people can find themselves on the Daily XRP thread with no idea how Reddit works.

I'm not sure why you're so against this and your response is illiterate at best. But believe it or not people are a lot more likely to stumble across this website through Reddit than google.

To each their own. Just trying to spread the word on Crytpo to those who may know less than us.

The above website is more aimed at crypto newbies, perhaps even people that would not use Reddit or forums (or even know how to). 
I have found a lot of these guides to be quite intimidating for people who don't often find themselves surfing forums.
With the Crypto industry set o explode in 2018 in should serve as an entry level gateway for people wanting to get involved.

Washed volume ��

That’s hilarious seeing as BTC is on the verge of a crash with ETH and XRP looking the opposite ��

Bitcoin isn’t an “asset class” for starters...

Bitcoin futures trading settled in FIAT with massive volume using “paper” Bitcoins

Bitcoin won’t ever reach the required convenience levels for true consumer adoption, it’s paved the way for change but won’t last the journey

There will be over 69 pointless posts on this subreddit per Bitcoin by year-end
@_date: 2019-12-20 22:12:38
Bitcoin mining pools 65% Chinese and the price is currently being attacked to force out other miners and bitcoin inflates ... just saying
@_date: 2019-12-04 20:02:18
If? They are already rinsing it through CME and Bakkt!!

Probably not even possible with fees...

You maxis are embarrassing, all you have left is your memes....
Funny how the BTC you love so much is now artificially propped up by quantitative easing undertaken by Tether and BitFinex until they get closed down by the NYAG.
The only value in BTC is the network, and the fact it is being utilised by other projects at start up for security , might not be long until that is no longer the case.
@_date: 2019-09-20 01:41:32
You have no idea what you’re talking about.
@_date: 2019-09-20 01:43:18
This endless shit posting from maxis is embarrassing... at least educate yourselves
