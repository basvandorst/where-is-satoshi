Bitpay isn't magic, they run out of coins at any given price just as much as anyone else.  If you made a million dollar cart on newegg there is basically no chance bitpay would be able to process that.

Credit cards don't charge of a transaction fee and you would need to pay sales tax in addition to that fee.

Still, having x coins * y sport price doesn't actually mean you have that much money until you can actually cash out or spend it.

Being a paper millionaire isn't the same as being a millionaire. In general for most of bitcoin's history even if you had X coins * Y spot price that was over a million dollars that did not mean there was actually any sort of organized way to actually cash out 1 million USD. 
Coinbase for example has a 3000 dollar a day withdrawal limit. Meaning it'd take almost a year to withdraw a million dollars, and fuck knows how much the value of coins change over that amount of time. You may or may not ever hit a million.

I can't wait for the halfing!

which means that if you had "1 million dollars of bitcoin" you would get far less than 1 million dollars worth of goods, significantly less as each additional one you spent was worth less and less.

That had minimal impact on users, and target would be infinitely more screwed if they had been holding bitcoin and had a data breach, no side of this would be better off with bitcoin.

It's absolutely a problem for bitcoin if it's doing a poor job holding people's money safely compared to other options available.

Looks like if the chinese government wanted to seize control of bitcoin they could.

mods never ever prevent the 5600 threads a day about banks making altcoins. It's only been certain altcoins that are banned.

The school fees surely didn't accept bitcoin so all you did was send him some thing he could sell. That is really nice of you but I am pretty sure he was excited about you paying his school fees instead of anything about the specific thing of yours that he let him sell. 
I bet you'd get the same reaction if you said "hey, I got a bunch of diablo III weapons I don't use, I'll send them to you and you can sell them"

When they say that they generally mistakenly think that satoshi invented ledgers or encryption or private keys or something.

The blockchain is public, you can see how many people are using it at any time. There are absolutely not 10-15 million users, unless the users are not actually buying or selling bitcoin basically ever.

Computers of the time were used by large businesses, governments, militaries, banks and basically were extremely successful with pretty much every sort of large important organization.

Your title is trying to use ambiguity to say almost the exact opposite of what that guy is saying. He is saying cryptocurrency isn't a big deal and that if there is any holding at all that it shouldn't be anything but tiny. And you are faking up the title to make it sound like he is saying a small holding would be a good idea.

This article is either misinformed or disingenuous. People already don't need to go to money exchangers to travel internationally. Credit cards and debit cards already are accepted globally and ATMs work nearly world wide. If someone travels extensively they already can get cards designed around that that have no fee. Credit cards basically don't care where you are anymore.

People will give you this weird answer that it's somehow okay because other people will still have their bitcoin and can divide them smaller and smaller. 
As if somehow people constantly losing bitcoin isn't itself a huge massive issue.

I make many tens of thousands of dollars a year, does that mean a taco bell taco could be priced 30 dollars and I'd still buy them?
Just because something is a small overall percentage of a person's resources doesn't mean they will always be willing to devote the resources to that thing. What happens if someone invents a currency that doesn't take 2000 dollar memory to use? 
@_date: 2015-11-29 21:58:28
What a weird scam. It's like a plan to scam so they will harass bandcamp. Like in some sort of thousand step plan that he will get rich quick if he convinces bandcamp to get scammed into using bitcoin by scamming other people to think he works for bitcoin, then bitcoin will skyrocket in price somehow? It's such a convoluted plan for a scam!

They are exact opposites. Computers were adopted right from the exact first days by pretty much everyone that could afford them. 
Bitcoins have seen almost no adoption in large organizations beyond a few computer websites that will let bitpay sell bitcoin for them. 
It could not be more different.

I am really always confused if people think satoshi/bitcoin invented QR codes or something, you could do all of this without bitcoin just as well (or better)
@_date: 2015-11-27 17:48:04
I wonder if anyone has thought of a name for an investment you need to recruit other people to to get your money back!

If anything this picture is a photo of a technology that people were clamoring to use even if it was expensive and bulky and overall not really there yet, compared to bitcoin which is still at the "beg your relatives to buy it at thanksgiving" stage. 
@_date: 2015-11-29 21:41:54
This isn't actually a guy from bandcamp, nor does bandcamp actually want to know any of that stuff, this is just a guy that has been spamming this stuff in a weird attempt to get people to email harass yet another business about bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 02:32:21
I thought you meant bitcoin, and yes, that is very much correct if you meant that if bitcoin is just going to rely on new hardware to solve all it's problems while other types of currency work on actual solutions. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 01:33:41
It's a bit of data that has never looked good for bitcoin and doesn't look good in the current political climate for bitcoin (where the campaign is for node operators to take on more resource use). So you are generally going to have a difficult time getting anyone to talk about or provide that information.

If someone ever figured a way to security take zero confirmations then they have solved the double spend issue that was the thing the blockchain was trying to solve in the first place.

6.9% of russians would be ~10 million people. 
There has only been 90 million transactions ever on the blockchain ever. It seems really really unlikely that there are that many users period. Let alone that being just the russians.

No, it's just dumb to magically hope better hardware will solve every problem in a world where better products could be invented and the free market could decide they are the winners.

Okay, but read what you just wrote and then read a bunch of get rich quick scheme websites and understand what you are saying sounds so so much like what a lot of them write and some people won't know you are the right one and the others are just pretending. 
@_date: 2015-11-28 16:03:57
Every single failed technology that failed to scale posts pictures like this trying to claim that since something else succeeded that means they are guaranteed success.

If you: the guy trying to sell bitcoin can't think of any advantages for them at this time, why assume maybe your assessment is correct and at this time it is not the correct platform for them? 
@_date: 2015-11-29 21:37:12
shh, we are supposed to pretend the reason it's not taking off is that it's some secret thing no one has even heard of.
