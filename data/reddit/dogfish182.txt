what the fuck? Go fuck yourself.
edit: Oh I see, it's a thing you do. disregard/well done.

Odd, I thought securecode was specifically designed to mitigate the skimming risk. 
how do merchants deal with fraudulent creditcards in the case of physical goods being purchased with it then? because if someone buys a lawn chair from me with creditcard then the bank says 'oh fraud' I'm out one lawn chair? I thought the bank bore the cost of that via insurance. 
I can't see the difference between bitcoin and any other physical good to be honest.

how do they mitigate the reversible risk? 
I'm assuming the 5.5% fee has something to do with it...

so you'll be supporting SEPA? because SEPA transfers for euros are just so damn easy, you'd be rich.

Ok, but if you steal a creditcard, how do you steal the securecode? 
provided only securecode (or visa equiv) are accepted, how does a stolen creditcard get the securecode? 
also, if a transaction is made with a securecode is it still reversible?

oh i'll cash back in, but I'm also risk averse. that 170 goes back in the system. I'm actually kind of interested in seeing if I can speculate my way to 1 shiny bitcoin. I'm going to make that my objective. after I've got one, then I'll begin figuring out how to spend it. I still don't understand how the volatility allows me to spend it confidently though....

how do you know they aren't going to do something? Heineken is VERY good at marketing but realising something like 'pay in bitcoins' for a company that large isn't just 'ok lets do it'

I bet it would be impossible to tell this man he's an idiot and have him believe you now.
what a fucking risky thing to do. He literally gambled his entire life on bitcoins. 
and WON bitcoins are so great.

but the good thing for you is you don't need to see the advantage as a consumer. you just need to easily open a new way to take money (predictable money).
If it doesn't get used, then I guess oh well. but if you do get some attention in the early days of bitcoin for taking it, might get some free business out of it.

at the exchange you sell your bitcoin on the 'market' you offer it for a price and if someone buys it, you have euros/dollars/whatevers (litecoin/namecoin othercoin etc etc). To get real money out of the exchange you must be verified, which means security details, ID, bank account etc.

what is to stop the thief just going dark for say.... 3 years with the wallet. then tumbling it when the worlds moved on a little? Also, I'm not understanding how the money is immediately recogniseable. Do I have the following correct?
Detective knows the original 'thief' wallet and therefore can continually search it on the public sites? He could essentially setup a basic website to alert him the minute a transaction is made from this website? 
what would the thief strategy now be? he would have to I guess go dark for a long time, then tumble small amounts (say 10 grand) at a time quickly. But the more attention this gets, the more authorities will begin to look at this specific wallet.
tricky problem/awesome story.

bitcoin.com 
install multibit
open program
push 'receive' see that big mash of text that's really long? that's your wallet address. Send bitcoins to that. it will land in your wallet.
all the trading websites create a 'wallet' for you as well, so you login, buy bitcoin and the money is put in your wallet. then you can send it to the wallet on your PC if you want, or cash it back to real money at the exchange if you want.
if you really want to do it, pick a reputable website and verify yourself with ID, then make a bank transfer and you're in the game.
@_date: 2013-11-28 16:58:16
is this... some kind of in joke? because it fluctuates like crazy and you can make good money by cashing out. 
I was playing with 100 euro since yesterday and cashed it out to 270 euro. I am kicking myself for not having the balls to do it with 1000 euro but oh well.
@_date: 2013-12-03 11:58:01
because that's how they make money, by taking a 'cut' of the transaction. otherwise you're just a messageboard not offering any services and you'll go broke (I assume).
@_date: 2013-12-04 07:46:13
don't think so, because if you remove your websites 'wallet' then the user has to use his own wallet. which he then must 'send' funds somewhere.... you would at least have to middle man the money to hide the recepients address from the buyer.
however, if you're a paranoid user, you can still use the website very well, you just store your money in your offline wallet. when you want to purchase, you agree the price, move exactly enough bitcoin to your account and buy leaving your account on the website empty. people don't do this for convenience reasons (and then pay the price)
@_date: 2013-12-03 13:22:20
I guess the idea with these websites is that you need to ensure a percentage gets dropped off to you. I think they do that by having those randomised wallet transactions that change every time. if you put the dealer in direct contact with the client, then for the transactions after the first one, they'd just cut you out.
@_date: 2013-11-29 07:06:07
it's already starting.
Link is in dutch, but you could run it through a translator. 
the short of it is, rabobank says that their clients that deal in bitcoins should already be assigned a 'higher risk profile' (read, check these guys out for criminal activity). The commission also had the opinion that there isn't enough oversight and can therefore easily be used for guns/drugs/kiddyporn etc.
