Update: Bitpanda responded a few hours after I posted this. They said I might have accidentally used a wrong transaction number but I double checked and I used the correct number (it would have been an unlikely mistake. I just copy pasted it). They promised to look into it on Monday and contact me. Fingers crossed, all will be sorted out! Their ticket system could use some improvement, though. I had to resort to posting on Reddit to get their attention.

I understand what you're saying, but they weren't responding to any of my messages and once I posted this, the issue was sorted. So, in fact, Reddit is quite a good tool for improving customer service. Also, perhaps you're richer than I am , but for me-- when 50 Euros simply go missing and nobody is responding...it's just not a nice situation. I'm sure you see my point.

I have been having problems with them too. Used a wire to transfer them money. They cancelled my order in the meantime and now they have my money, gave me no bitcoins in return and are not responding to my ticket messages ☹

Final update: it was the bank that had made a mistake and for some reason my money didn't get there. This sort of thing happens, I suppose. The Bitpanda guy was very nice and dealt with it on a Saturday, also throwing in a bonus for the invconvenience! I think I'll use my debit card from now on! :)

Yes, thank you again!
