They could have at least tried to make this look real for humours sake. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:59:13
Honestly if you are retarded enough to confuse the two you deserve to lose your money. I can just imagine the room temperature iq autists who hear about bitcoin and either deposit their bitcoin into a bch wallet or think they're getting a sweet deal.

this sub is unbearable. completely mainstream reddit now. Just a bunch of circle jerking soy bois who invested 50$ into bitcoin and think they are the fucking wolf of wallstreet. WAHOO WE DID IT! POST MEMES! WERE A TEAM!

Cope is strong. Bitcoin is gonna crash and burn eventually. It is a dinosaur and all of you dumb fucks who don't know how to move crypto are gonna get fucked. Whenever you see a sub starts looking like mainstream Reddit it's time to go. You are WAY too late to the party for bitcoin lmao. God I hate redditors
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:44:47
This is not correction you absolute amateur. People are moving out of bitcoin to profit from this bcash craze. They will move their money back to bitcoin when the hype is over. You literal rookie... holy shit don't ever use buzzwords again you neckbeard, fedora tipping fuck.

god shes dumb as a rock
@_date: 2017-12-03 03:13:09
Yeah I bet that happened exactly as you said it in real life
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:43:05
lmao youre dust dude.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:17:31
bitcoin is a joke. people just pump money into it. it is not viable for anything other than imaginary money that people buy because they want to sell it for higher price in fiat. $50 tx fees alone sum this up pretty well.

The lightning network is autistic, but okay. Bitcoin has a good year plus ahead of it but it will not last forever. Better tech is already out there and there is plenty more to come.

Your family is fucking retarded. How does your mom even function in day to day life
If my mind ever went to that point I would immediately off myself. Imagine being that dissociated.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:00:05
did you read? I said bitcoin has a good year plus ahead of it.

you cant be serious. OP is either trolling or should never... ever reproduce.
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:51:18
satire? how are you using a computer?
Update: Its a female with what appears to be a room temperature IQ based on past posts. This person might actually be serious.
@_date: 2017-10-24 04:55:47
