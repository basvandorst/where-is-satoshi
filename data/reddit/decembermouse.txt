They can see all the activity on the Blockchain, but how will they track what activity belongs to a specific person? I've never cashed out myself, so maybe doing so would answer this for me... when you cash out, your wallet is tied publicly to the cashout service's wallet, right? At what point do the dollars (or whatever currency you're receiving) get linked to the specific BTC that you are sending to the cashout/exchange service?

Looks like they took care of that. Good catch.

This is an amazing milestone. Way to go everyone. With this thread alone, reddit will go a good portion of the way towards meeting its daily gold goal!

Since BTC doesn't use banks and the Blockchain doesn't attach names to wallets, I'm wondering what they'll really expect people to report. The IRS knows what banks we use and such, but there's no convenient way for them to determine if reported transactions or taxes paid on BTC transfers are honest or not, without requesting taxpayers to give the IRS their wallet information.
... is there?

I'm still pointlessly running a Block Erupter @ 333 MH/s!

I wonder how much a Satoshi will be worth at that point! Actually, that's another thing that I've wondered about, maybe you'd know the answer...
With transaction fees being as they are, doesn't that mean the Satoshi and µBTC can never realistically be used for transactions, as it costs more than 1µBTC to transfer 1µBTC?

I care to listen. I'm curious about the use of the computer, too - new OS, fresh install, create wallet. Then what, disconnect the computer from the network permanently once you've got your private key written down?

This had not occurred to me. You bring up a really interesting point. I can't wait to read about the first divorce lawsuit where Bitcoin is involved. The law will have to make some sort of stance on how Bitcoin is viewed in a legal sense - and even if someone is ordered by a court to pay their ex, you can possess Bitcoin without anyone knowing...

That's a cool feature. I really need to figure out how to use this bot... I have a wallet, I've read the instructions, but am too scatterbrained this week to process it!

Yup, you're only limited by how many full-powered USB ports you have. They sell USB hubs with power adapters if you want to run more than a few Block Erupters, but make sure if you want to run this many that the hub you want to buy is really rated to provide full power to all of its USB ports constantly. From what I hear not all can handle the power draw of a few watts each, as most people don't connect a full-powered USB device to every port of a hub. You can find good hubs on Amazon though, by the same people who sell Block Erupters.

Yes, one effect of this would be that a satoshi goes up in value, and people start using those as the new bitcoin unit rather than mBTC or µBTC.
Of course, buying up a huge chunk of Bitcoin then waiting for this to drive up the price of the remaining Bitcoins may give said buyer the option to sell their treasure trove at a then-heightened price.

.0984 here! My initial goal was 0.1, just to try out the network and to learn. But now I'm shooting for 1.0. It's going to take me a whiiile. I'm mining but only to contribute to the network, as I'll never make more than a couple % of 1BTC doing that. It's fun though!

I enjoyed reading your story, but especially appreciate your realization in the last paragraph. I think, in addition to the two options you listed, some see it as a fad or something to roll their eyes at. If only they understood Bitcoin's history and how it really works... but it's too complicated for some people to be bothered with it. Oh well, in a few years when it becomes even more mainstream, I'll at least have benefited from giving it a chance and climbing aboard the train before those who would write it off without even learning about it get on board.

If you already have a PC or laptop, save yourself hundreds and just buy a Block Erupter. 336MH/s, which is right up there with some of the more expensive GPUs you can buy. Block Erupters can be found for ~$15, give or take, including shipping.

I got a 336MH/s Block Erupter a couple weeks ago on Amazon because I had a $25 gift card and figured I could afford to blow half of it, as I am interested in Bitcoin. It's made me maybe Ƀ0.005 in 2 weeks, and this rate will continue to go down as the rate of difficulty increase intensifies. I don't expect to turn a profit, but I love watching numbers, and I've been running Folding for a decade, so this is another fun project like that for me.
Those high-powered parts are real, and are designed specifically for performing the type of computations that Bitcoin mining requires. No way the systems will end up paying for themselves, though.
If you mine, do it in a pool, or you will never actually mine anything. I read somewhere today that if you have hardware running 24/7 at 100MH/s it will take you around 98 years to find a block. I'm at 400MH/s now with my GPU and the Block Erupter, but I still don't want to solo mine, as I'd never find a block.
