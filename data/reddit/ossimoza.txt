A word of advice from cartoons for you my friend: "Hope is wasted on the hopeless."

Ahahaha... holy sh$t! How to regulate the unregulated market! All this will do is build the "Oh sh$t, Oh sh$t I'm going to lose all my money" suspense!

Just a spot of advice on trading (as this is essentially what you are asking) form a trader:
*When you entered the trade (ie. buying your bitcoins) always have a stop-loss in mind and when the price reaches your stop-loss sell without question or debate. Have some loot left in the tank to play again another day.
*The head in the sand approach will land you in trouble eventually.
(Not looking at the price or switching off you PC falls in this category)
*If you want to sell, sell before everyone else decides too.
*Lastly, previous results do not dictate future performance.

This picture completely sums up the last couple of days. Bitcoin is a currency not something you should feel emotional of patriotic about.

Google the front page of the companies section of the FT last week. The worlds most respected daily market publication. Show them the graph then and the price this week. I don't necessarily agree with the investment case at these levels but if you justify your reasoning as the world awakens to the possibility by showing them major interest globally at least you back your story. And you get to show your boss he is a retard... that is a great feeling too.
