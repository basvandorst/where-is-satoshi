It's not like Satoshi was omniscient god. In what Satoshi describes, he does not take into account that there's nothing forcing miners to behave in such a way. That's why network can not rely on this behavior as a principle.
And it's actually beneficial for miner to replace pending transaction with a one that has a higher fee. It is also making possible to adjust transaction fee higher in real-time in case of contention. So we can have blocks that are always almost always full, with a real-time bidding market for priority. So that most important transactions can go through first, and your non-priority ones can wait for a better time.
It all makes sense, if you think about it. Even if one does not agree with such approach, and thinks blocks should grow forever and include every coffee transaction.

Since you resort to "calling names" that is my last reply to you.
I don't deny economics to be a science or it's real life usefulness, yet I don't consider it a hard science. Economics deal with human behavior, politics, complex systems involving human lives and the ability to experiment and reproduce results is limited. That's why I consider it "soft science".

I wouldn't trust any cloud mining company. I share opinion of Gavin (most of these companies are potentially Ponzi schemes). And a lot of them are just plain scam. Was it TimeToBit that turned out scam few days ago? They were "trustworthy" too.
Mining is a minefield, no matter how you approach it. Why are people so eager to try it is beyond me. :D Actually it's probably because it makes an impression of "free money", and human brains have some form of short-wiring to fall for this. That's why most of ads have some "free shit" -150% SALE and similar stuff.
I also don't understand why would anyone borrow you 2.5BTC, but I'm sure some people will, and that's non of my business.
You know what is IMO best plan to Bitcoin investing? Put 5% of your savings into Bitcoin cold storage, use BTC in your daily life when it turns out more convenient or cost effective, get back to work that earn you a salary and keep visiting to be aware on what is going on.

Bitcoin core client is written in C++. You won't get faster than this just because you've used different language. In big simplification the CPU computation performance of Go is around 85% of C++ (people will hate me for saying this, because I've pulled this out of my butt, just to give an estimate that layman can understand). This is good enough performance and it does not really matter, because dealing with Bitcoin is mostly handling network input and output, not performing calculations (unless you're mining, which is different story). So it's going to be fast enough. On top of this Go is a nicer, more modern programming language that it's easier to write good quality networking code, utilizing all the cores.

When you're "hoarding" objects you're preventing other people from using them for something more useful, waste materials they were built from etc. "Hoarding" Bitcoin costs economy nothing, since they don't have material scarcity and any other meaning than just virtual comodity.

Double spending that would be publicly visible, only with Bitcoin control. Though it would be a problem, it wouldn't be a catastrophy. There's a ton reading material about this.
Noone alone can change the rules. Bitcoin protocol is set of rules that are "set in stone" by general consensus. However, if everbody would agree that the rules should be changed, we could all move to slightly different Bitcoin rules, but that would not be the same rules, and anyone that would not accept new rules, could stay within the old rules. That would create two separate Bitcoin networks: new and old. And their would either exists side by side, or one would prevail and users from the other one would give up using it. So generally either "general consensus (users, miners, services) agree on a change" or we stay with the original rules.

So basically it's just an algorithm to split arbitrary values into series of cycles of same-value transfers between subset of users. I haven't found it in the document but it seems it's not completely arbitrary. Eg. Any user must not have more coins than all other users combined. Not a big deal though, I believe.
Overall it seems like a pretty simple scheme, and I wonder how much of anonimization it really provides.

In Bitcoin the evilness is greatly limited. They can try double-spending (detectable, after attempted) or imposing some limits on what transactions get included. In both cases they risk that the public will get unhappy about it and eg. just switch to something else (eg. fork Bitcoin to use different PoW / sidechain / altcoin).
Obviously it's not desirable, but chances of such event are low, and consequences dire. Still way better than what current financial system offers.
In case Bitcoin would get really big and important, I would suspect some institutions (maybe even governments) would keep Bitcoin mining running even at a loss, as public good which would discourage any private monopoly. Why would there be companies trying to monopolize a market, that is unprofitable in the first place?

You don't have to make any mistakes. Someone will take care of smearing you.
Also, in hierarchical structures only people that you can control get help from the top. If you're on top of hierarchy like a political party, it makes sense for you to promote people below you that you know have dirty secrets that you could use against, in case they stop being loyal. That's why all hierarchical structures degrade in time and get filled with a clique of corrupted people that are forced to be loyal to each other.
Also, that is a reason why I think in democracies people should be randomly selected to the parliament (with a posibility of picking up someone instead of you), instead of making elections.

The solution for borrowing is simple: people should be borrowing using something else than money. What and how exactly is yet to be figured out.
The system that sits in my head is: Any person or entity producing anything of value can issue personal "credits" in a public ledger backed by publicly view-able legal contract, and issue more at will. IOU notes should have slightly negative real interest rate, which means: if I give you IOU the longer you hold it, the less you're getting from it. Creditors are free to trade and exchange different IOU, which settles their value on the market. So Coca-Cola trades "CO IOUs" which are backed by bottles of Coke.
People would be borrowing and investing using IOUs, while saving in sound money. Hoarding money is preferable as it's harder to get hold of and noone will borrow you any, but getting IOUs is easier: if you work for Coca Cola, you will get paid (at least partially) in CO IOUs, and so you need to spend them somehow. As a merchant you want to accept them because people are willing to spend them, and they are backed by real goods. The competing IOUs and their price denominated in sound money will be a market decision for credit availability and it's price. In such a system the credit is not the only liquid asset, and it does not have to expand forever.

First, raising interest rates will not cause inflation. It will cause deflation, because of money shortage.
Second, what does one (believing in end of race to the bottom) has to do with the other (complaining about inflation).
My bet is that FED does not want a hangover and the party will go on worldwide till all participants are dead. But I'll believe monetary base expansion is over when FED starts raising interest rates. I'm doubtful it will end good, though.

Socialism can not work without tyranny and always leads to it, no matter how good are intentions behind it.


In capitalist, monarchy, anarchy and all other political/economical systems there is nothing preventing workers from owning a share or running their own companies as a group. 
Let me FTFY: The central tenet of socialism is to **force** workers either own or have direct democratic control over the means of production.
And the word **force** is why if you believe in socialism you can't be libertarian at the same time. You believe the utility of social equality is more important than freedom.
Socialism needs to tax, control money, capital, prices etc. because it's so unnatural and painful that everyone except "the believers" want to escape it and opt.
BTW. One point of Bitcoin from my perspective is protecting me from people that believe socialism is a good idea, without resorting to violence . I hope you will all die-out taking your false god with you to your socialist hell/heaven. :)

Once Open Bazaar will gain traction Credit Card companies will be bleeding. It's just CC model is so stupid and Bitcoin is making it easy to exploit this stupidity.

Couldn't reputation-like system be measured by money locked in an N-to-M escrew, controlled by reputable entities? In case of fraud or company going bust, these money could be used to refund some of the victims, while reputable arbiters would take some cut (just like an escrew) for their effort. Users could white-list and black-list arbiters, and simple algorithm could calculate how much trustworthy is the vendor from perspective of user selection of arbiters.
Other than this I don't see much of a point in any "reputation". Reputation will be taken care of outside of the OpenBazaar. Reputation is not numbers, it's part of the common knowledge spread from person to person.

And people were not believing opinions that in the future mining is going to be done at cost. Imagine every phone, when charging battery, also mining BTC. End user does not cry about couple of dollars a year worth of electric bill (might have got a discount on it's phone etc), but combined millions of devices around the world, will make mining Bitcoin for profit ineffective, which will kill centralized mining operations (as in storing a lot of miners in one data center with cheap electricity) not profitable. Centralization of mining pool is still possible though, as it will depend on who is in control  of the address of the pool for which each phone is going to work for.

No normal people will be buying Bitcoin if just sending it to your wallet costs $100. And with 7tps, network could probably barely handle international inter-bank settlements. Changing 1MB to 20MB blocks, is not a scale for byuing coffee at starbacks. It's barely anything useful if Bitcoin is to have any significance.
While on the other hand 2TB drive costs $80 on Amazon: 
In 2 years it will be $40, in 4, $20.
It's hardly any investment for let's say ten thousands people to spend $80 to maintain the ledger redundancy, especially considering blockchain pruning. Storage is not a problem. It's only about bandwidth and potentially economy of mining.

Because I can tell you their opinion: stay out of the Bitcoin, buy vanguard index ETFs. They will tell you nothing more than Investopedia.
From my perspective GBTC is overly-expensive, even considering potential tax benefits. 
Edit: I've got gold for bashing r/investing. Boy, doesn't it feel good? :)
Just to extend since people seem to find it interesting: I did not research it fully, so double check everything I say, but GBTC (at least ATM) seem to be twice the price of the underlying Bitcoins it actually holds. Also, I've seen comments that it has very high maintenance fee (for what, keeping paper wallet in a vault?!), so no matter if Bitcoin is going up or down, you're going to get shaved by the fees. Also, at the end of the day it's way better to have your BTC under your control, rather than a promise of Bitcoin fiat equivalent. 
@_date: 2014-08-22 17:06:35
That's is very, very bad idea. Rule of thumb: Don't take loans for anything related to Bitcoins ever. EVER. Invest only what you could completely loose and be relatively fine with it. Bitcoin as an asset is a speculative investment. Mining as a business is based on the price of Bitcoin and other factors so it's even more risky. You make your calculations, buy hardware, and the very next day someone introduces new batch of ASICs and difficulty goes up 40% in couple of days. Your investment is over.
Other than this, mining is saturated, competitive market, and it boils down to: how cheap electricity can you get. Unless you have a free or almost free electricity, don't even think about it.

Rules of Bitcoin, will always be a subject of political debate, because Bitcoin a concept is just a consensus on how we determine who owns what. And consensus can change, or even be disputed for a while, and everybody can vote by participation or lack of it.
It's funny how many of people think miners or full-nodes are deciding force. It's the opposite: miners are servants of the users, on our leash and being paid by us. If Bitcoin forks it's "the network effect of economical value" that decides which fork will win. There can be really one mining pool, couple of full nodes on the new-chain, against  whole army on the old-chain, and it doesn't matter as longs as the users (people that are actually willing to pay for Bitcoins to use them) pick new-chain. Miners will switch to whichever chain gives better value (expressed in fiat, gold and any "real value", not nominal BTC value). And if mainstream companies like exchanges and services switch to new-chain, bringing all the mainstream users with them, then old-chain is just not worth using, mining it has no advantage, and attacking new-chain is pointless, when it's more cost effective just to switch to the bigger group (in terms of purchasing power).
So it's up to the community to decide if we want to use a system that can scale and be used by many more people at once, and can this be economically sustainable at the current technology level, or should we wait/do something else.
Gavin educates, make his points and tries convince community without antagonizing anyone.  Popescu is probably the biggest jerk in the community, and his flock are such a dickheads that I'd be happy to see them using separate chain just so they can circlejerk and pretend they are the kings of the crypto-word in their own sandbox. Anything they write is so repugnant, that it's just impossible to argue with them. It's funny how they define "THE community" linking between blogs of handful of people.
All that we need to do is to make sure people are aware of what's going on, agree, have time to prepare and experience is as smooth as possible without, confusion and scams like Popescu's threats.

If Bitcoin doesn't scale enough, people will eventually switch to altcoin that can. And we will all loose our BTCs value. If I will ever have to pay more than $10 to send BTCs anywhere, then I'm going to make only one transfer: to an exchange to sell everything.

So dumb. I would always pick Trezor, with paying premium because ... trust. Now the trust is gone. I can as well buy a cheaper clone.
Now silently rewriting software history, breaking Open Source promise... and what tomorrow? Introducing silent bug into software to make my coin go into your account? I know that your work deserves reward, but you can't pull shit like this, guys. This is not how you make a brand, this is not how you establish a business in paranoid environment of Bitcoin.
You want to change the license? Discuss this with community. Maybe you could release new software and designs on reference-only license first, and then fully open it after some time, to leave yourself some competitive edge. Maybe the communit will accept it.
There's still a way back. Get back to original license, come clean on what happened. Lower the price a bit and get a investor if you're running out of cash. Seriously, venture capitalist are pouring money on free services offered by SV startups and you have a market leading, desirable, working product! I was considering investing into Trezor myself (no joke, I asked if you even consider investors, see my comment history). There are other ways to monetize. You can sell ads, ask for donations, charge for Trezor integration with other software plus obviously people will keep buying Trezor at premium if we can trust you! Why would I buy a cheap clone from people I don't know if for couple of bucks more I can have a real Trezor, that I trust, that never fails, that gets updates first.
You had a spotless reputation, skill and experience. Don't ruin it.

I'm sorry but that's just ridiculous. :)
A centralized database plus/or redundant copies on each sides would be cheaper, faster and safer. There's no need for blocks, as there's no need to for things to "settle". There's no need for mining, block chaining, proof of work, anything that makes a blockchain a blockchain. All you need is a a computers with a databases, some signed certificates for signing, and that's it. Parties just sent each other signed transactions and keep the log of it. That's not a blockchain and there's nothing novel about. Banks could have used that technologies for years already.
Blockchain sucks as a database. That's why we have block size debate, scalability issues etc. The only reason it is being used is that it allows trustless and premiossionless global interaction. Blockchain sucks and it's a price for only these two features.
This whole "blockchain-without-bitcoin" theme is just FAD for suckers. A lot of investors are jumping on that FAD because they have no idea what they're doing. It's laughable. If people are looking for really useful tools for modern banking, they should look at OpenTransactions, and stop babbling about blockchains.

And instead it's a ruthless "whatever it takes to save our political union and banks" , bloodsucking and German imperialism.

I was very suspicious about Purse at first, but it's been more than a year now, and all I can see are just allegations. Where are all the reddit posts that prove how much of scamming is there going on on the site? Personally I had only minor issues with it through all this time. There are users that bought my orders 3 times in a span of more than a month, so I can't believe that was just a stolen card. I'm sure that if someone puts a 30% discount order, then only a scammer would bite that. But 15%, seems like a reasonable deal for cashing out an illiquid gift card, or maybe transferring Mechanical Turk credits to a developing country.
Also, I would use Purse even with no discount just for free Prime deliveries.

So due to the fact my initial attempt failed, my data was erased?
Well, my paper backups were OK, so no harm done, but I was a bit stressed about it. :D

Don't use printers/copiers like this for anything Bitcoin-related. They have hard drives recording everything that is being printed on them.
You print your wallet at work or something, put your savings in it, 3 years down the road printer gets decommissioned, your BTCs are gone, and you have no idea what happened.

It seems my Trezor gets stuck on "INSTALLING..Please wait". Never had problems before when updating the firmware.
Edit: Restarted brower, plugged Trezor to different (faster?) port and it worked.
Edit2: Damn it, it is setting itself up again. My old account was erased? Why so? I hope (think) my paper backups are fine, but did this happen?

What it seems to me, no matter which side (deflation enthusiasts vs (post-)keynsians) is right the whole problem turns into big group prisoner dilemma. From perspective of each person it's better to hold deflationary money like Bitcoin, then inflationary money, even if it was better for a group as a whole to use fiat (because it allegedly stimulates the economy).
That is why the only way to save fiat is to ban money like Bitcoin. But as it's technologically difficult, the victory of deflationary currencies seems inevitable. 
We like it or not, the deflationary money will return to the game, and economy will have to work in that system with other tools. Eg. denominating self-issued debt backed by assets etc.

You're misunderstanding what was the meaning of "unproductive assets like houses".
Houses are "unproductive assets" not because they can't generate income, but because they are not essentially used to generate capital, but as "end good". Houses are necessary spending. Just like you need food to survive, or to wrap your body in clothes, you need to keep yourself sheltered. But you don't consider food as capital generator (even though you can make money on growing, or reselling it!). It keeps you alive and happy, which allows you to stay alive and be productive, but housing, food, clothes are necessity: the end goal of your work, not capital. 
With renting a house, it's a service of allowing someone to use "the end good" that is generating profit, not the end good (house) itself. Obviously you need the end good itself first. But the house did not produce anything. It was the construction company that generated the unproductive asset: the house, which you can now rent to other people for profit, instead of "consuming" it yourself.
