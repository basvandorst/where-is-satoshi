We pretty much have automatic lace up sneakers available to purchase now too. That took a long long time but if you really want them you can get yourself a pair. Bonus points for purchasing them with bitcoin. As for hoverboards... we have to keep on dreaming about those.

Africa really needs to focus on getting more of the population connected to the internet so they can become more educated. Just imagine how different things could be when kids can look things up for themselves and not have to believe everything they are told.

As an individual it shouldn't be much of an issue because the fees will only seem big if it is huge amounts been transferred. The miners have to have an incentive to mine. 
Say a few decades down the line when companies use bitcoins instead of printable money, say if they want to transfer a big amount to another company then the fees shouldn't be an issue for them because they are a company and it will be part of running a company... understanding that the miners will take a small cut for allowing them the instant transaction.
@_date: 2019-07-09 19:45:21
Perhaps in the future when everything is a lot more advanced, stable, understood, established etc etc.. 
You could store some of your BTC in a wallet that is insured for reasons such as theft etc. So you can make a claim and have some sort of insurance on a wallet.  Of course the service will cost you a monthly fee or something for having it insured but I could see that been a solution to gun point robbery etc..
Of course.. you don't have to store any coins like that but for people who would like the ability to claim stolen coins back then it would be an option.

Hi, I know this isnt related but you seem knowledgable about bread wallet.
Just moved my bitcoins to a bread wallet on iPhone.

Of course it can.

@_date: 2019-06-28 14:55:29
This is very true and is the case with every spike, the reason we get these fast price increases is because of new people jumping on the band wagon with very weak hands and lack of knowledge. They buy as the price is rising quick and sell when the price is dipping quickly and then buy again as it's rising and have slightly stronger hands but still watching the charts closely. It takes a few bad moves to understand that if you just wait it out the price is increasing generally and the spikes are irrelevant. the smooth lines are where the true believers are, they hodl and don't care about the spikes. Experienced people who have already got profits may choose to sell during the spikes knowing there will be a crash afterwards with chance to pick up cheap coins to hodl. It's all about past experiences and believeing in the longevity of the tech. I expect the next true craze will soar past 20k and attract a lot of new people who are gonna get burnt. The news reporting hasn't even started yet, everything is pretty chill ATM. things will get crazy in a few months time.

Never rely on coinbase during high traffic times, they consistently do the same shit. just when it seams the perfect time for you to buy or sell... The website lets you down and causes you an immense amount of stress and uncertainty. Everyone starts with coinbase and everyone has been shafted by them in one way or another. avoid coinbase

Yeah the fact that apple accepts proper bitcoin wallets that you can use to pay with is gonna help a lot. So convenient.

Personally I would love it if Steam started accepting bitcoin, I think they could sell games to us for even cheaper due to no international fees etc
Perhaps there holding off until the value of a bit coin is more stable and settled.

On bitcoin-QT I don't have a transaction fee setup.
