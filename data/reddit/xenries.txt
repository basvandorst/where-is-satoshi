I decided to spend $30 on Bitcoin instead of an MTG fat pack on Amazon recently. So far I made a good call :)

Cryptocurrency in Iran has been banned since 2018, they seized 1,000 bitcoin mining machines a few days ago because of a power spike. Then again Iran bans it because they can't control it, and now some of their officials are talking about trying to make their own cryptocurrency. Same with India.
I mainly don't like this article because now its telling them where other machines may be hidden. I like how they take advantage of the loop about the government providing free energy to mosques though :) News outlets are a gift and a curse.

How banks make money:  [ 
* **Early account closure fees** – closing an account before a set period of time
* **Foreign transaction fees** – fees for spending money outside of your country
* **ATM fees** – fees for using an ATM not associated with your bank
* **Overdraft fees** – fees for overdrafting on your account
* **Maintenance fees** – monthly fee for maintaining an account
* **Minimum balance fees –** fees for not maintaining a minimum amount in your accounts (both checking and savings accounts may have this fee)
* **Service fees** – fees for meeting with a teller instead of using free online services
* **Transfer fees**  **–** fees both for sending outgoing wires and for receiving incoming ones
It sucks, theres also other ways they make money like interest, etc. I think Bitcoin's evolution will be similar to how phones evolved with contracts and minutes for example.

Even if you don't reach the peak at least you made some money. Some great advice I read somewhere here on Reddit: "Bulls make money, Bears make money, Hogs get slaughtered."
