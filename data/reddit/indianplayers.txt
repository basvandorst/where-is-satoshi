Looks like he knows where "some" coins disappeared to.
@_date: 2013-06-20 00:03:30
WOW! Relax and take a deep breath. You are just going to hurt the bitcoin community by doing all this. Did you try communicating with them? If so where are you having issues?
@_date: 2013-04-13 14:46:22
Use bitinstant. Don't use coinbase because it will take few weeks for verification &amp; delivering your coins. Bitinstant does this in 1hr
@_date: 2013-08-08 20:30:21
 
@_date: 2013-07-22 14:28:53
Um okay
@_date: 2013-06-17 02:17:36
Do us a favor and abandon it. We don't give "a flying fuck" about your bitcoin expedition. If you don't give a "fuck" why should we give a "fuck"?
@_date: 2013-05-14 01:11:51
LOL... Yet he doesn't have one. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:40:37
Don't know where you sent $$$ from but they do give you receipt, confirmation number etc. I used them twice and received money within seconds. 
@_date: 2013-06-19 14:27:17
Sad but you might be right about them taking offline and shipping. 
@_date: 2013-06-21 15:23:44
sloooooooooooooooooooooow! 
@_date: 2013-06-14 14:05:10
Exactly.... If you want to invest in mining you should look over 5000MH. Anything under 1000 isn't worth it anymore.
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:07:00
That's not hard to do either since Bernake manipulates the shit out of it lately. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 15:09:15
Post your issues on this forum... their customer service staff is always on there, so maybe you'll have better chance there is a 'bitinstat' member on reddit you can message. 
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:15:47
Warm gooey feeling? I don't even want to know what that's about. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:43:11
Not sure if you will get your coins back, but the admin is a good guy and helped me get my 3.02 coins back when I forgot my ID/password. 
try these:
@_date: 2013-05-06 16:09:35
Wow. Great article. What amazes is the fact that China's controlled media let the bitcoin documentary run. Also the number of wallets being downloaded.... time to buy more coins!
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:49:34
This happened to me too... Also they said I can cancel anytime unti it arrives, but the frickkin cancel button disappeared in few minute. Coinbase sucks I'd pay more any day to receive funds faster than a week.
@_date: 2013-06-14 16:23:27
LOL Charlie screwed you!
@_date: 2013-07-04 01:40:08
50-70 is more likely, but can easily move back to 100 on good news.
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:01:26
Some drug dealer cashing out.
@_date: 2013-06-28 22:39:38
What's Ripple?
@_date: 2013-04-20 03:43:56
Let me guess you just bought some coins. Someone can just dump a bunch of coins and you'll look like an idiot. This isn't a stock market just look at the chart for the last 14 days. Good luck!
@_date: 2013-07-04 01:37:50
WTF. I need to use protection for this also?
@_date: 2013-04-12 21:06:12
they messed up my buy... when i purchased it said i can cancel until the delivery, now they took out the cancel button. 
@_date: 2013-07-06 15:47:04
Fun game that will keep you occupied for hours. 100+ spins and in profit shows game is not rigged. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 15:35:25
I've used it 6+ times from Wal^^ and always transferred in seconds... maybe someone mis-keyed the account number?
Edit: Never mind... They have issues since their "new" site went live yesterday. See their Facebook page. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 19:39:07
LOL. This is like the craigslist post I saw a month ago... I replied and this is what he wrote...
"Well, we provide services of "bit-broking", like being a stock broker, we developed new programs to make it faster and easier to keep an eye on the market without delay. Trained accountants and brokers are working at all times in shifts 24/7. So you can send the coins to one of our addresses, and you will get a receipt. If interested let me know."
 
@_date: 2013-06-14 16:46:37
Translation: fartgass will be buying bitcoins after 8 CEST tomorrow. 
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:48:53
I use them all the time and stuck coins is really a hassle. Kind of misses the point of of sending bitcoins instantly. Just in two days 3 transactions were stuck. They need to let us pay the .005 fee for faster transactions, or give us the ability to cancel transaction after 3-4 hours. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 13:41:22
There's a bank like that for bitcoins called Coinbase. World would end by the time you get your coins. 
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:37:25
PTB all pulling all kinds of shit.
@_date: 2013-07-11 16:24:03
The last dip in price was a false flag???
@_date: 2013-04-16 13:15:39
Bitinstant to Mt.Gox they take 4-5 percent on $500 but well worth it. I received funds before I got home. A lot better than waiting a week on coinbase. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 14:56:44
Plarenvy - it went down so fast that if there were open orders before you they got filled and went back above 118.
@_date: 2013-05-13 20:28:59
Only if you can tell us how many stars are in this universe...
@_date: 2013-06-22 01:01:52
Used them once and prefer coinroll better. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 18:38:52
WTF was that?!* 
@_date: 2013-04-16 20:03:28
I wrote "I used them twice and received money within seconds." Apparently I know how it works since I received my money..... anyways good luck. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 18:22:16
Has anyone tracked the account number from zipzap.com? I paid yesterday, but still shows pending. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 21:02:06
i thought you were doing over 10k in sales a week... and 1k brought your business down??? 
@_date: 2013-06-14 16:59:44
What do pirates and pimps have in common?
They both say "YO HO!" and walk with a limp!
@_date: 2013-06-18 14:12:33
I think it's just People just buying after few days of 100's. FED meetings could be another reason. Their decision might bring down markets and good for bitcoins.  
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:01:23
I'd get out if you can!
@_date: 2013-04-21 15:28:42
Moral of the story.... don't get high working with more than $100.
@_date: 2013-08-01 12:59:38
Count me in.
@_date: 2013-04-17 07:54:26
Whew! I'm not the only one.....and thank god I took a snapshot of my funds before going to bed.
@_date: 2013-05-14 16:07:43
Not for a meal, but gave my friend 5 BTC's and he spent it all on  Satoshidice ON ONE BET..... not doing this again!
@_date: 2013-05-07 14:21:34
Lol I bought coins from this nerd
@_date: 2013-06-20 14:47:32
You keep posting these BitInstant is a scam posts, but never explain what your issue is.....maybe we can help you. 
@_date: 2013-06-17 20:29:44
A hot cashier ; ) 
JK - Just the shipping address, email, phone (optional) and payment fields. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 14:33:09
At the moment 
1.30024167 coins per day
134.98 dollars per day
break even in 18.8 days 
Remember BF labs just started to ship these, so they still need to fill orders from last year. Also by the time you get yours there will be many many asics online, so difficulty will increase. I would estimate 1/4 of what's listed above by the time you get yours. 
@_date: 2013-04-21 14:34:30
STFU 
@_date: 2013-10-22 13:54:50
@_date: 2013-04-25 20:33:28
If it breaks $120 LOOKOUT BELOW!!!
@_date: 2013-12-28 19:02:32
No. Bitcoin exchanges in India are shut down that's why.
@_date: 2013-06-18 18:51:02
After you fill out the information you will get a Receive code (9611) and an account number (123XXXXX). When you go to Wal-Mart go to the customer service/returns desk and look for the blue moneygram form. Fill that you and give it to the cashier. You can pay with either cash or debit card. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 21:17:19
Get in touch with -Olaf- he can help you.
@_date: 2013-06-12 16:49:50
I think he's in Europe, so will be overnight if you are in US. 
BTW he's 'Scrat Acorns' in the forum. 
@_date: 2013-06-18 17:27:13
Passed! I with that person with the wall doesn't do it anymore....why play mind games when everyone knows you'll pull the damn wall!
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:23:19
@_date: 2013-07-06 15:36:49
 Someone flipped your chart upside down.... Your doing it all wrong.
@_date: 2013-04-17 22:29:10
Still needs edit order feature otherwise it's good.
@_date: 2013-04-12 17:11:42
"it can go $500 who knows $1,000 before it crashes" is not a prediction. 
@_date: 2013-07-05 21:25:47
NO thank you. I had too many coins to do this.
@_date: 2013-06-22 01:20:01
Good for new purchasers, but thanks screwing past purchasers Coinbase.
@_date: 2013-06-14 17:03:15
Exactly... I've been in stocks too long to fall for this sh!+
Sell = Buy
Buy = Sell
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:19:28
I double you Raoul Paul!
$2,000,000 it is.
