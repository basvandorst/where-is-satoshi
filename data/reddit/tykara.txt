Haha, I know it's a scam.  
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:39:13
I thinks it's totally legit
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:13:23
@_date: 2018-08-11 06:39:32
100% scam
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:12:56
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:12:39
Yeah lol.
@_date: 2019-11-06 02:43:17
More as a joke I think
@_date: 2019-11-21 02:52:48
Damn ��
@_date: 2019-11-06 04:58:47
I have to agree this video wasn’t the best but some of his other stuff is pretty good.  I pick and choose for sure.
@_date: 2019-11-06 03:59:10
He tried his best
@_date: 2019-11-25 06:43:37
I’m 20 no one will listen
@_date: 2019-11-06 05:49:49
Why would he buy 1 full bitcoin tho? Makes no sense if he didn’t believe in it? Could have bought 0.1 and done the same things.
@_date: 2019-11-27 17:42:29
I don’t mention it ever.
@_date: 2019-11-06 02:24:45
Most of his fans are like younger so they don’t care lol
@_date: 2019-11-06 15:09:12
Next level stuff lol
@_date: 2019-11-06 02:54:54
I mean he at least knows what it is. He has a whole bitcoin probably gonna dump it at 40k
@_date: 2019-11-06 03:59:40
Yeah it seems like it. Just mostly for fun
@_date: 2019-11-06 01:43:16
He seems quite knowledgeable in the subject it seems. Just a fun watch either way.
@_date: 2019-11-06 05:46:11
@_date: 2019-11-06 05:54:20
My thought exactly but it’s stupid he could have just said it instead of actually buying 1 full bitcoin lmaooo
@_date: 2019-11-21 02:53:54
Why can’t I post this?
@_date: 2019-11-06 01:53:23
Not sure. I just posted it because this dude was relatively popular on YouTube. And it seems like he kinda ish understands something about bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-21 03:38:36
Should I blur it out?
@_date: 2019-11-06 05:39:57
@_date: 2019-11-25 06:43:01
@_date: 2019-11-06 04:40:33
Yeah. Some of his stuff is pretty interesting.
@_date: 2019-10-01 22:07:17
Hopefully all goes well. Keep me updated
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:41:29
It’s in the activity tab. That’s what I do. Has all that information
@_date: 2019-10-18 17:29:17
You can earn interest on it.
@_date: 2019-10-01 22:58:28
Totally agree. I wouldn’t store more than a certain amount I’m comfortable losing and foregoing
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:37:28
100% why don’t you just look at your purchase history instead of writing it all down?
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:54:29
Do an excel sheet save your time lol
@_date: 2019-10-01 22:58:02
I’m looking at like max 5%?
@_date: 2019-10-25 19:35:24
Good job!
@_date: 2019-12-18 02:14:10
Sell sell sell it’s going to sub 3k ����������������
@_date: 2019-12-04 18:40:08
Wait a minute
@_date: 2019-04-23 19:39:06
@_date: 2019-01-06 18:52:32
I have no idea. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 18:51:14
Lol. So stupid 
@_date: 2019-01-06 18:54:23
Heheh. It was taken when the price was $3800. 
@_date: 2019-01-06 14:44:22
ATMs charge a commission xD
