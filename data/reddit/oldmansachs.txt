Specifically his position sizing. He’s talking like he’s trading several btc each time but I’m gonna guess he’s trading a g or 2 and thinks he’s hot shit with a few hundred dollars profit

Price would stay the same until supply entered.

What no bitcoin future contracts are worth 5 bitcoins, with a 30+% margin requirement. And thats not how an etf works jesus. You need to do a little googling on what futures/etfs are man.

And thats great, but it doesn’t give them the right to talk so much shit. You need to have made a few hundred k to earn those privileges.

Have fun arguing these aren’t unregulated securities now.

Oh right, one specific example of a US counterfeiting case debunks my entire argument. Shit.
     
If bitcoin’s intended purpose was to make hodlers rich then its not a currency, its a commodity/security.

How about you read the laws yourself. What bitcoin investors want is for it to become “current money” which is forbidden in US law. If crypto were to actually become and be used as currency, rather than just a speculative security, it would be illegal. The government won’t do anything about it currently because hardly anybody actually uses it for it intended purpose.

States rights? You do understand it is illegal for individuals and states to create/approve new currencies. The reason crypto is still grey area is because its more of a unregulated security than a currency, which means gov regulation is the only way it will have a long term future
