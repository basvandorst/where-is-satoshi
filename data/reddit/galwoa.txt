I wouldn't say a spokesmen of Bitcoin. This isn't even related to Bitcoin directly, I just thought it was interesting how he proposed the use of blockchain concepts for increased transparency in government. Something a lot of people have been calling for.

This went largely unseen the first time it was posted ( maybe because we were in the middle of the December price rise. But I think it's an interesting paper (with use to Bitcoin) and worthy of discussion.

Depends on how technical. The OP mentioned something which describes a bunch of features, Mastering Bitcoin did that very nicely (with some code to walk you through and solidify understanding) imo. I think it's a great book and would most certainly be considered technical by somebody who isn't familiar with how Bitcoin works at a fundamental level.

I'm with Cobra on this one. A feature of open-source and decentralized projects is the potential for individual ownership of private property. That's exactly what bitcoin.org is in this case, and Cobra shouldn't be pressured to give up control.

Why not specify the college? Or the specific article?

Yeah, that's the tweet I was referring to. I took that to mean that the 'child' would have Bitcoin as a fundamental part of it.

Don't give it away, Steam allows you to get a refund for any game played less than 2 hours. So just ask them

1) Megacoin isn't his own coin. It was made by some random people who thought making it look like it was associated with the MEGA brand would make it rise in value.  
2) He has already tweeted that it is going to heavily feature Bitcoin integration.

Nope, they dropped the murder for hire charges and he's currently in prison for the drug related charges. So whether or not the murder things happened, we assume not as innocent until proven guilty.

That's why micropayment channels are being introduced and experimented with (Lightning Network being one of them)
