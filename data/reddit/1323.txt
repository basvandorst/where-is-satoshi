Amazing find. This whole interview is by design. Both of these guys are playing dumb.

@_date: 2014-10-13 07:00:21
You can have a cold stash and keep it simple with a wallet that generates an infinite amounts of addresses too. Putting everything in one address on paper wallet just makes it more difficult when you want to move some of it. You have to move all of your funds and then create new paper wallets for the remainder. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:45:34


Edit: electrum.org says that the seed is stored encrypted. So I dunno. It might be safe.

@_date: 2014-10-12 20:13:59
Yeah, but I don't see the point of "storage" if you need hot wallet functionality. Point is, Trezor needs to address their closed source boot loader before it's fully trustworthy.

You can encrypt an Electrum wallet when it's running on a computer/usb stick but it does not stay encrypted if you restore it from its seed. If you set a password, and then restore your wallet from your seed, it will just ask you if you would like to create a new password. 
@_date: 2014-11-14 01:37:39

I wasn't arguing that this isn't thew case. I was simply explaining that it is unavoidable and has been all throughout history.

Inequality is simply a fact of life. I'm also willing to argue the world will be better off when the current top bitcoin holders are part of the worlds wealthy elite vs how things are now.

I also use Armory (with m-of-n fragmented backups) and Electrum offline wallets. Also a BIP38 password doesnt need to be close to the length of a key. Just long enough so it cannot be brute forced, while I obtain the other copy of my wallet and empty it before whoever obtained my wallets (which is extremely unlikely as is but you make it out to seem like it's easy for some reason). 
tl;dr I prefer my methods and for Coinbase to be completely out of the picture.

Okay, the context is subjective there.
The fact you mentioned it's the only one you "absolutely trust" pretty much implies you seem to find it the most secure. User friendliness has nothing to do with trustworthiness. Either way my point is Trezor should only be recommend for inexperienced users while costing $120.

I'm not a huge fan of Trezor but their wallet allows you to add a password to the seed which is needed to access the wallet. You can also add multiple wallets with different passwords to the same seed. This offers security in the fact that no one knows how many wallets you have on your Trezor except you. This is actually by far the best feature of the Trezor wallet. Would like to see it implemented elsewhere. You can also think about splitting up your seed to offer more security when storing it. Armory wallet has this feature built in. It is my favorite wallet. I use it for offline cold storage and for a hot wallet. BIP38 paper wallets are recommended as well.

Solid quote right there. I still strongly believe everything can be done with dignity and that's not what has been going on. I want see bitcoin to replace the need for WU as much as everyone else, but I don't see the need to start campaigning and targeting single companies like this. It's going to eventually happen regardless and I'm sure WU will adopt along the way to cut losses if they have any amount of intelligence.

Yeah that's why you have an offline watching wallet for storage that you rarely withdraw from and another hot wallet set up to hold small amounts for spending. To suggest someone implement anti malware techniques for large holdings is irresponsible as it should never come to that point.

If its an unencrypted paper wallet, anyone who has it can access your funds. If it's encrypted you just need a password to go with it. You can share this with your family as you do your other passwords. Also if you have family you can trust, keep copies of your paper wallet at their house. If you are still unsure, keep copies of encrypted wallets at their house, but store your passwords somewhere else.

I just think once people learn and actually implement other methods of storage they will stop leaning so hard on other companies like Coinbase. Not only that, they will feel better and more confident about their funds. I agree with you and realize these methods might not be for everyone, but the knowledge of sound cold storage through multiple means needs to be spread.

I assumed long term storage by context, and to say Trezor is the most secure is a 100% flat out lie. Your ignorance is really showing. Yes, to people like you who aren't technical and need something anyone can use Trezor is a great product. To say it's better or more secure is ridiculous. Please explain how Trezor is more secure than some of my methods of choice:
1. Armory offline wallet
2. Electrum offline wallet
3. BIP-38 encrypted paper wallets
And for the record, I purchased a Trezor to see what it was all about, but when I realized I didn't need it and became more comfortable with other options I sold it.

@_date: 2014-10-11 20:49:10
You don't need antivirus if you are creating a truly secure wallet.

Finally some sense in this thread. Trezor worship needs to stop.
@_date: 2014-10-18 16:25:44
Yeah, I agree. These people will downvote anything they know nothing about.
@_date: 2014-11-15 18:51:55
I dont believe you know how to properly put coins in cold storage. Otherwise you wouldnt be here acting like a bitcoin noob.
@_date: 2014-10-22 16:41:59
Dude stfu. No one cares about faggy ass bits.
@_date: 2014-11-15 01:02:12
Seeing as 99% of posts mentioning alts in this section get downvoted it's 100% clear that these Scamthereum threads are upvoted by manipulation and subsequently filled with a shill circle jerk in the comments. 
@_date: 2014-11-24 23:01:22
Dumb as fuck. 
@_date: 2014-11-16 16:48:45
You're a moron and wrong if you disagree.
@_date: 2014-11-20 20:00:16
Yeah, like I said I have no experience with Macs, but I do however remember a laptop a few years back that would not load Ubuntu no matter what I did so could just be one of those rare issues maybe. 
@_date: 2014-10-25 21:33:04
Encrypt your 12 word seed? Is that what you are saying? Just go BIP38 paper wallet at that point. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 00:46:49
That is completely irrelevant.
@_date: 2014-11-22 17:44:22
Known bitcoin troll/buttcoiner ^^^^ ignore.

Oh look more faggots circle jerking.

I know but that shouldn't help protect your coins. Keys should be offline.
@_date: 2014-10-12 21:22:29
That's funny because today is the first day in a long time I *haven't* smoked weed, and I have been all in bitcoin for some time now. Upon not being high, nothing about my opinion on bitcoin or my risk of going all in has changed. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 19:15:35


This is the ignorant part. What does bitcoin have to do with opposing credit? Nothing. 
Credit is necessary and a very useful tool. Only people who oppose it are those who can't manage their money properly. 
APR = annual percentage rate. It means I can spend all I want for 18 months but as long as I pay it off by then I wont be charged anything on top of what I spent. Thanks credit, I have a lot more options now.

Yeah because, you know, no one has to own the property being rented.... Property tax is reflected in rental costs, so rent would go up. Do you people even think?

I wish I remembered, but Andreas Antonopoulos discusses how it would be done in his address to the Canadian senate. Don't remember which part. Will try and find it later when I have time. What would be wrong with a trusted 3rd party though? I don't know if it is possible to get a loan from the blockchain. 
Ethereum is a scam. When you take millions of dollars from "investors" and nothing is ever to be seen from it, it's pretty obvious. Yes, they played a lot of people and suckers. No one should ever mention the name again. (fyi, I didn't give the any money, just stating a fact.)
@_date: 2014-10-25 17:36:01
Buy in again now to lower your average buy in price. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 08:28:34
Source? I was unaware. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 18:30:43
This. Very stupid idea.
@_date: 2014-11-26 04:01:48
My sentiments exactly.

My local shop refused to refund me for a random trinket...I guess I'm not using the dollar anymore...
@_date: 2014-10-12 21:44:09
It doesn't need support. Also, I'm not going to watch it. 
@_date: 2014-11-15 00:52:31
I swear these stupid Ethereum/Counterparty threads are upvoted by bots. 
@_date: 2014-11-26 05:14:38
Point was to have a discussion that would get upvoted. Have to make an interesting/controversial/cringeworthy post to make that happen. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 07:32:37
No. He's a a troll/shill/idiot. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 10:05:53
That for sure, but make sure your keys are in cold storage too. 
@_date: 2014-11-25 23:03:05


Company vs company =/= company vs decentralized currency. There's a huge issue with making that comparison. 
@_date: 2014-10-18 19:03:50
Andreas Antonopoulos talked about this in his address to the Canadian Senate. Video here: 
Can't remember the time, but it's worth watching the whole thing if you haven't.  To answer your question, yes, you will be able to take out loans and have lines of credit with bitcoin. A separate network won't be necessary. 
@_date: 2014-10-10 21:13:51
Once btc is more accepted and less volatile people won't need to change it into their own currency.
@_date: 2014-10-20 19:57:42
I like his response regarding Apple Pay.
@_date: 2014-11-29 20:29:38
Lol. Are there only ignorant noobs in this section now?
@_date: 2014-11-15 22:40:29


South Park is one of the smarter shows on TV just saying. It also has a large percentage of online viewers compared to many shows. 
@_date: 2014-11-20 20:19:41
What the fuck for? He's already spamming his blog. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 05:09:34
I would normally agree, but these sort of phishing attempts are VERY convincing to someone who is a) a new user or b) has there guard down/intoxicated. Doesn't matter if the person is above average technically or not.
