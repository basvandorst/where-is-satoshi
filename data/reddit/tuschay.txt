I'd sell two limited edition giclee prints, signed and numbered. You can see them at  in the shop. 
Message me if you're interested :)

Are you upset that you didn't get any? +1000 doge
I know it may seem like spam to you but we're just trying to show the entire crypto community that there's more than just panic and despair during these huge hits.

Geez man you are really bitter. It's kind of getting difficult to see past that but I'll give it another shot. 
First off, I'm not on IRC and couldn't give less of a shit about what a few people are trying to do in a market that is open for anybody to join. Nowhere along the long the line did we say that everyone is perfect in any community. Actually, because of our kindness we've seen a lot of scams, but I don't really get too concerned with that because where there are laws there are thieves and that's just a fact of life. 
There are pump and dumps with every coin out there and I'm sorry your friend had his life threatened. Not exactly sure what he exposed or where it happened, but if you could link me I'd love to give it a read.
Bottom line, relax.

I'm actually not lying about anything. Some of your comments have a hint of truth to them. We do want people to go to but you're wrong to think it's for malicious purposes. I, along with most of the people tipping in want this community to feel better about what's going on right now in whichever way we can. That's it.

I'm an illustrator. Two weeks ago I started offering 50% discounts on my giclée prints. (
There have been a lot of merchants starting to accept BTC from what I can see around Reddit and various forums. I'd be interested in seeing statistics on how many of these merchants have received any payments in BTC since they've started accepting them. I have my doubts that anyone will spend BTC on goods or services until the price stabalizes, and there's no saying when that may happen. 
A friend and I made a $20 bet around 2 months ago and I lost. I paid him with 1 BTC, which was a little over what I had wagered. Today that's roughly $130 and everyday my little bet becomes larger. 
I love watching this revolution and I'm very excited to be part of the growing market, but until there is stability in the price I don't believe anyone will want to let go of their coins for goods for at least a couple of years.

Yesterday I decided to start offering my digital art as giclée prints exclusively for Bitcoin.
I have wanted to sell my art for a few years because of the interest that I've received from friends and colleagues, and now I am hoping to spread the word about Bitcoin onto them by finally offering my art through my website, except I will not be accepting any currency other than Bitcoin. My hope is that this creates enough curiosity to seek more information and spread the word about Bitcoin through their friends, family, etc. 
Just trying to do my part and add to the Bitcoin world of tomorrow!
Thanks for stopping by :)

I was introduced to BTC via a friend who was on SR. Although he regrets having spent the coins, I remind him that if it weren't for SR in the first place, he and I would have likely not heard about Bitcoins until much later.

Do you mind telling me around when you purchased them?
In early March, my friend and I settled a $20 bet with 1 BTC (which was a little over $20). Now I find myself thinking about how expensive that bet turned out for me.
