Yeah..... It’s going to be a while before that happens. Back down we go.
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:50:58
no it won’t. It’ll be down at $9200 or lower for quite a while.
@_date: 2019-07-19 00:45:00
What about all the people who make more than that already? It would if a new person would start a job with the same pay as someone who worked 5 years to get $15 would be crappy. Any idea?
@_date: 2019-07-14 14:38:04
Not for long. Maybe after it falls below $9000 and goes back over, you can use the meme again,
@_date: 2019-07-25 22:00:55
Very true. Why not?

Is it ERC20 only or anything?
@_date: 2019-07-30 02:38:50

@_date: 2019-07-27 16:12:00
no way will we keep going up. We’ve already hit our high for the year.
@_date: 2019-07-14 03:34:34
We’ve already hit our high for the year. There’s no way it’s going to keep going up like it has recently.

This doesn’t come across as a speculative post. It’s a definitive statement actually. Then, you reply to someone that you don’t promise. You just contradicted yourself and it shows lack of confidence. A speculative statement would be like, “I feel like it could possibly be around $4,100 this September.”
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:05:26
Yep. Find a software wallet like Exodus (Computer and mobile) or a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano. Not those specifically - just giving you an idea.
@_date: 2019-07-29 02:19:33
lol yeah right! There’s no way that’s going to happen!
@_date: 2019-07-25 20:20:53

I don’t believe so. I would check every “read only” and “disable withdrawals” box I could find as well as anything related to it. How well do you know this person? Are they someone you contacted online or someone local?
@_date: 2019-03-14 23:44:36
A quick dump and quick pump by bot orders probably. Not sure though, but it looks like bot activity. Who knows though. 
@_date: 2019-03-14 21:31:16
Drop it and let him say whatever. Not everyone knows much about or trust Bitcoin. I would just let him say whatever. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 19:55:11
I have no clue. I’ve heard of people giving their api to fund managers, so they can trade for them.  Maybe try and find more info on the person doing it. How did you meet this person?

@_date: 2019-03-01 18:46:55
If you have full trust in him and you disable withdrawals. I, personally would think it’s okay, but you have to decide that yourself. Coinbase has a tax option to download a spread sheet. Most exchanges have an option to download your trading history. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 12:57:50
Too off balanced for me. Like two swoop-y. Great idea, but keep trying.
@_date: 2019-03-07 20:40:29
So, with most coins - If you purchased $100 at ATH, you now have $2-$3. That’s not depression to you?

There is no CEO.  No one owns Bitcoin and there’s no office. Satoshi Nakamoto is a pseudonym for an anonymous person(s) who created it. No knows who he is, not even the people who worked with with him. Satoshi worked with others behind a highly secure and encrypted, untraceable pc to program and interact with programmers and developers to get Bitcoin up and running . No one can shut Bitcoin down, edit or counterfeit it. It’s interesting to read about Satoshi and the creation of Bitcoin. After about an hour of research, you should understand. Bitcoin is decentralized, anyone can use and transact with it. So, Bitcoin couldn’t do anything for “copying” it. Satoshi made Bitcoin open source so people could copy it - he/she/they wanted other people to innovate with the technology they created. The idea is a whole world of decentralization: financial, a new internet, medical records, authenticating products, travel planning, gaming and anything else can one could think of. 
@_date: 2019-03-01 18:41:53
for what? Whatever you decide, just make sure to disable withdrawals

@_date: 2019-08-29 16:09:40
you’re right
@_date: 2019-08-22 02:37:59
I really have no idea. It’s a guessing game for the most part.
@_date: 2019-10-15 19:27:39
I do understand that for the most part. I guess my concern is the price being suppressed by the people and institutions - What if they always transact OTC? However, it does seem like they’d want the price to go up at some point. Lol
@_date: 2019-08-28 17:04:11
Conspiracy theorist much? lol Sounds delusion to me. Besides, Bitcoin has been going sideways for a couple weeks now. I guess you never know though, existence of life itself is mind boggling.

Why would I sell just because I think we’re going back to a bear market? I’ve been through a couple of them. I just think it’s going to be a while before we see a huge long rally. I feel the price is suppressed now. Either CBOE or CME even said when they were coming out with Futures that they would tame the price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-22 14:31:42
Nope. You’re wrong. Educate yourself! It’s simple! Don’t embarrass yourself!
@_date: 2019-10-14 22:39:16
$16k would be nice, but I don’t believe in time travelers. I might consider it though if Bitcoin actually did hit it before the months up lol.They did, however, have a lot of great guesses. I know that Bitcoin and a few alt coins have had gains this year, but for the most part - isn’t the rest of crypto still stuck in a bear market that’s been going for 21 months now?
@_date: 2019-08-04 03:09:42
Doesn’t Cash app, Gemini and others in the US do that as well?

Have you looked that the number of Bakkt contracts?! Around 50 bitcoin per day lol! Bakkt has a lot of awesome features, but my point is, is that if something as great as Bakkt can’t even heavily influence the market right now - it proves to me that interest in crypto is terribly low at the moment.
Bakkt volume

He wasn’t having the hard drive repaired. Computer manufactures can’t do that. Tech diagnosed that the problem was the hard drive - They literally just took out the bad hard drive and put in a new one. Theres very few things to check whether a hard drive works. With sata and ide Hds, the first to they to check is to listen if it’s spinning or making weird noises when you turn it on. Besides, this post isn’t about the hard drive as much as it is this guy NOT being Satoshi. It’s the same type of things with those time travelers. Over dramatic delusions or pulling some kind of stunt.

Nope, have been hodl’ing way too long. Just not convinced a full bull market is going to start anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-10-05 14:57:55
I’m not familiar with CoinJoin. Is it for anonymous transactions, I guess? Anonymous transactions should be implemented on every crypto to keep hackers from knowing how much each address holds or at least separate the address from the amount held. Also, if a lot of companies started paying crypto, other employees could potentially find out everyone’s income.
@_date: 2019-10-07 22:08:14
Trust me, I would absolutely LOVE to be wrong! I’ll gladly accept it if I am :)
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:50:49
We’re back in the bear market. This was just one long freaking bull trap. All of these futures coming out are going to crash the price of Bitcoin and ruin the whole crypto market. The only reason it almost hit 20k in 2017 is the CME and CBOE pumping the market so they can short the crap out of it. This becoming a joke.
@_date: 2019-10-14 22:34:49
lol, this isn’t going to happen i don’t think. It would be amazing, but since $14k we’ve been slowly going down lower month over month.
@_date: 2019-10-07 19:30:05
it would most likely be a failure like BAKKT, i think.
@_date: 2019-08-04 21:12:44
Awesome, thanks a lot!
@_date: 2019-08-18 15:53:28
Only if they pump the price like the first futures did so they can then short the shit out of it! It’s going to be OTC Bitcoin used for the futures, so idk how well or badly it’s going to affect Bitcoin. If the supply gets soaked up quickly, then I think it could be good. We’ll have to wait and see.
@_date: 2019-10-04 02:54:54
The domain may be private, but the bitcoin used to purchase the domain can be found and tracked. Why not use Monero.
@_date: 2019-10-07 19:24:04
How did they make sure that got in to the eyes of the people? Not everyone reads coin news and social media. If you don’t know something exist, then how do you know to look for it. If anything, they should have made the reputable exchanges let their customers know as soon as the IRS released whatever guidance. The people aren’t blame. Most of us want to be compliant, because we’re afraid of government entities.
@_date: 2019-08-28 20:57:13
Down. We’ve already hit the high for this year.
@_date: 2019-08-28 23:11:16
My hands aren’t weak, but I’m by no means bullish at this moment. Until the previous ATH is solid support, I’m remaining bearish and just hodl’ing.
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:21:21
Like I said, if you don’t know something exists, then you can’t know what to look for. Why should someone go out of their way to find something they don’t know exists, if the IRS doesn’t go out of their way to make sure people know. I bet there’s a handful of laws you break on a weekly basis that you have no idea you’re breaking because you don’t know they exist. Maybe you need to be better informed about every law? Nope.
@_date: 2019-10-07 23:23:42
okay thanks. My point is, our privacy is being invaded by third parties and shouldn’t be.
@_date: 2019-08-15 20:54:59
not for a while
@_date: 2019-10-09 21:15:50
Chainalysis. They’re gathering all (mainly Bitcoin) data - when it was purchased, where it’s been sent/received, who it belongs to by tying it to our IP address and then selling it to the applicable government entities. Plus, if they can figure out our IP address, they can find out our house address as well as other personal information. This tool they use will end up in the hands of hackers and this will be even worse.
@_date: 2019-10-07 19:36:05
True lol. I know Coinbase makes us aware now, but that’s after the government demanded them to hand over our purchase and sell history for the years they failed to let us know.
@_date: 2019-10-07 19:24:38
I follow that. You’re right, I believe.
@_date: 2019-10-04 02:51:04
Because Bitcoin addresses can be tracked  unless you know exactly how to cover every single step of the bitcoin transaction. Even then, it’s risky. They can tie the domain purchase to a bitcoin address, then trace it back to where it came from.
@_date: 2019-08-27 01:49:26
I’ve not heard of that, i’ll have to look!
@_date: 2019-10-16 18:27:23
Just have have enough to pay off some debt
@_date: 2019-10-12 00:31:31
Most people don’t even know what a vpn is to mask their IP.  Even then it doesn’t mask the MAC address of their device. Chainalysis can get that data from anyone that buys from an exchange or send/receives using their device. For those people, it’s extremely easy to find out their info. Chainalysis is able to do that and is hired by the IRS to track down Bitcoin address, how much they have, transactions and who owns it. Those people that have no clue who Chainalysis are, shouldn’t have to worry about their data being obtained, especially if they’ve done nothing wrong. In a perfect world, everyone should know how to protect their privacy through the many tools available - even then, there’s a hack for every patch and tool that comes along. People should know how companies are using their info and they don’t. That’s my point and a fair one.
@_date: 2019-08-02 20:35:10
I seriously doubt it lol
@_date: 2019-10-16 18:17:40
It’s not my plan, it’s a scenario I thought would be interesting to get opinions on. Thanks for yours.
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:00:45
CashApp, Coinbase and Gemini are the most reputable companies in the US to purchase crypto and maybe Voyager. Bitcoin or any crypto doesn’t see your ssn. It’s required by US regulations that the company gets your info to try and prevent illegal purchases, tax evasion and money laundering. After you purchase it, you can move it to a wallet like Ledger or something. It’s the only legitimate/safe way to purchase Bitcoin or others.

Buying buying OTC and selling in market. Shorting.
@_date: 2019-10-17 00:23:53
In fact, OTC transaction are also mostly kept private. OTC prices have absolutely no influence of how much the price is on the consumer market.  
A little google will go a long way. Here’s a quote from a quick google search:
 “OTC is a bit different. Here, the buyer and seller are trading directly with each other – no exchange intermediaries, only them and the OTC agents. In this case, when the buyer and the seller manage to agree on a given price at which they are both willing to conclude the transaction, they can settle the deal by paying directly to the other person. In this case, the transaction doesn’t make it onto the market. It is a private deal with increased anonymity.”
@_date: 2019-10-16 18:16:00
Unless you’re saying something else - OTC buys and sells don’t have any influence on the price and doesn’t reflect on the market cap sites or exchanges. Buying OTC is like me giving you $8000 for a Bitcoin in person or through email, then you send it to my wallet. It’s not going to reflect on the price.
@_date: 2019-06-27 00:36:20
It’s just a lucky guess. There could have been a lot of sell orders that may have been triggered at that price causing it to dump for a moment. You can’t time the top of any rise, it’s just luck.
@_date: 2019-10-07 20:08:42
101 is better than 50, but it’s still not what most people were expecting and for a company owned by ICE, it’s a small amount - even for a couple weeks old. The point i’m making, is the interest isn’t there right now. It’s not Bakkts fault.
@_date: 2019-02-05 17:57:20
lol up or down? 
@_date: 2019-10-07 19:17:46
My opinion. Bitcoin is entering a bear market and alt coins (except a few) have been in a bear market for 21 months now and still falling. Doesn’t look good. Bitcoin stayed around $10,000 for a months and dropped and now it’s struggling to stay above $8000 for a couple weeks now. I feel like it’s just going to keep falling.  I’d love for it to hit new ATH soon, but I think interest is fading. How many contracts does the infamous BAKKT have now? lol It’s a joke.
@_date: 2019-06-16 02:15:18
Well, back down to $7600 we go
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:16:51

Yeah, i’m not buying anything right now either. Surely, it’s going to go down soon lol
@_date: 2019-06-03 19:41:20
it’s not going hit $9000 anytime soon. That has already proven with the crazy rejection the other day.
@_date: 2019-10-04 13:16:41
If that’s so, then that’s awesome. Thanks for the advice.
@_date: 2019-02-13 21:32:56

Thanks. I’ll check that one out.
@_date: 2019-08-27 17:22:26
They’re selling between $400 and $550 with what i’m selling on Ebay. I just don’t like ebay.

Still, it was hyped even more so than the CME. Even though, the bear market started after the CME launched, their volume was insane.

@_date: 2019-06-04 00:28:39
Looks like you’ll have plenty of time for that.
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:45:27
With the credit card, i didn’t take in to account how they calculate the early payoff. However, i knew if i over paid, i’d get the money back eventually. With crypto - if i send too much i would know i wouldn’t get that back, so i wouldn’t do that with crypto.
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:28:03
.....or you can buy now and sell at $6000
@_date: 2019-06-12 03:33:59
I have plenty. Just don’t think it’s going to keep going up right now.
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:39:29
It doesn’t leave a person at ease, that’s for sure!

Most people would sell and the institutions would finally own mostly all bitcoin except for the very few hodl’ers and the few that can only afford to buy a few thousand satoshis. My opinion.

@_date: 2019-02-19 18:46:04

@_date: 2019-06-27 19:27:51
Yep, back to the bear market.
@_date: 2019-10-14 22:33:06
Well, even though this is obviously not true - they did have a long streak of great guesses. Have to be wrong at some point.
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:41:59
that’s true. However, I can buy back in cheaper right now. I didn’t know that would happen for sure, so i could have lost.
@_date: 2019-02-24 16:06:45
not trying to be a backseat driver, just figured it was too good to be true right now 
@_date: 2019-02-05 21:16:34
True, I get what you’re saying now. 
@_date: 2019-06-30 03:17:53

@_date: 2019-02-04 21:38:55
It’s definitely interesting lol. Do you Hodl, trade or both?
@_date: 2019-02-05 21:15:56
Same here, have a mortgage, but still buying on the way down. I’m about out of money to keep buying the continuous dips though haha. Maybe I should have just bought like every other dip since there have been so many. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 03:05:42
I agree with you. It was just nice seeing it getting so close to $4000. Not complaining a bit. 
@_date: 2019-02-19 20:56:21
I’m kind of doing the same thing right now
@_date: 2019-06-13 17:22:33
Yes, you’re right, kinda. i paid off my credit card and over paid by $500 apparently. So, they sent me a check and my bank won’t accept it.
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:14:42
Looks like it’s back to the bear market.......
@_date: 2019-06-11 17:50:34
You really think so, huh? I believe we can’t go much higher for a long time. There’s no way right now.
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:22:34
Apparently, a whale just moved over $200 million in bitcoin to Coinbase according to “whale alert.” I don’t know if that’s it or not, but the timing is perfect.
@_date: 2019-06-26 23:23:52
So, they accidentally put 706 Bitcoin into your Coinbase?
@_date: 2019-06-13 17:31:38
i paid off my credit card and over paid by $500 apparently. So, they sent me a check and my bank won’t accept it.
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:53:00
That is a perfect statement in all aspects! 
@_date: 2019-06-13 21:52:55
Thanks, that may work
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:13:04
Nope. 100% They said a check from a credit card company isn’t guaranteed funds. I’m going to talk to someone else because something isn’t right.
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:23:39
Lol this is a falling knife. It’s going to be a loooong time before we see $8500-$9000 again.
@_date: 2019-06-25 13:21:35
Some people’s feelings get hurt very easily. You know - the “everyone should be a winner crowd?” If anyone says something that doesn’t agree with them they started crying and just can’t handle it. lol Those type of people can say anything they want, but if someone else says something out of place they’re upset.
@_date: 2019-10-17 01:27:04
That info is all over the big trading desks and coin news sites - it’s not just coming from some random forum. I’ll gladly take a Google search that leads me to a reputable site for information than make false arguments. I don’t see how you don’t understand how OTC trading works. If I sent you $40 billion of bitcoin from my wallet to yours right now, it would not affect the market in anyway, whatsoever. This is how OTC trading works. You’re can’t be that clueless lol. No way can someone not understand that. I assume you’re trolling, so you’re not getting anymore of my attention. Thanks for your input.
@_date: 2019-06-13 18:30:48
I was only trying to deposit it. I didn’t even want the cash.
@_date: 2019-06-14 20:42:28
lol shit man
@_date: 2019-02-05 19:02:17
I can agree with that most of time. It’s just funny to see the exact same thing happened 3 times in a row and now we’re at the point where it could happen a fourth time. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 02:06:33
what do you have in mind?
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:30:02
However, if this is a bear trap, i fell for it. Sold just a tad in case.
@_date: 2019-02-04 03:23:09
It seems that way lol. How long have you been in crypto?
@_date: 2019-02-05 21:13:25
lol, damn, you’re right! 
@_date: 2019-06-04 00:19:29
i guess the saying “Sell in May and go away” is true.
@_date: 2019-02-05 21:19:05
Sounds like old Metallica from the Master of Puppets era lol. Awesome!
@_date: 2019-02-19 21:16:14
I’ve not heard of people doing that before. Great idea!
@_date: 2019-02-04 03:27:03
When did you start? Around May 2017 for me.
@_date: 2019-02-11 01:14:22
No way. 
@_date: 2019-06-28 21:49:16
It’s definitely not going to keep going up like this.
@_date: 2019-02-13 02:15:55
I’m getting ready to cancel my capital one card and i’m going to tell them it’s because I can’t buy crypto
@_date: 2019-02-11 03:39:38
Awesome news. I just hope they really pay out their affiliates.
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:53:58
That’s a good strategy!
@_date: 2019-02-05 18:25:05
Great points. It’s definitely getting bad for some project’s devs. 
@_date: 2019-02-04 21:53:34
I know how you feel. I can’t afford a full Bitcoin right now either lol
@_date: 2019-02-09 03:48:33
I’ve always been a tech guy and built computers and stuff. I heard about it when it first come out, but I didn’t pay any attention to it. In 2017, a guy at work told me how much money his son made on 1 Bitcoin. Since that day, I’ve been hooked. I just can’t afford to buy much :/
@_date: 2019-02-23 18:23:45
That article is from Sept 2018!
@_date: 2019-06-14 18:17:31
I pay taxes out of fear and believe it’s the right thing to do since everyone else has to, it’s only fair. 
However, we elected these people to work for us and they pay us back by threatening the entire crypto community when most of them are not even doing anything wrong. The want us to elect them and when we do, they turn against us and make us fear them instead of working with us. This is so upsetting.
@_date: 2019-02-16 20:34:45
 not even close
@_date: 2019-02-13 20:23:28
Is that chart showing an inverse head and shoulders?
@_date: 2019-02-06 02:42:04
well, if Bitcoin doubles to $6800 then your $6 would double to $12. If Bitcoin went up 10x to $34,000 then you’d have $60, etc. 
@_date: 2019-06-03 18:49:32
Maybe at one point, people will be talking about how many satoshis they own because 1 Bitcoin will be out of the question.
@_date: 2019-02-01 22:51:49
we’ve not seen any higher highs for over a year now. So, I think a while. Once the first higher high happens, maybe things will start to get more interesting. Just what I think. 
@_date: 2019-06-04 02:30:55
That’s fine. I would love it if I’m wrong.
@_date: 2019-02-21 02:15:06
Nope once again
@_date: 2019-02-19 20:55:24
Sounds like a good plan to me! 
@_date: 2019-02-24 21:22:36
I would personally, split it into 4 equal parts on 4 different secure wallets.
@_date: 2019-04-05 22:58:23
You missed it
@_date: 2019-04-06 22:31:59
I didn’t see drugs mentioned in this discussion.....? There are actually honest people out there that want anonymity for their own safety from hackers and to protect their right to privacy.  However, there are also people that do it because they have something to hide - We just shouldn’t assume that it’s everyone. 
@_date: 2019-04-11 01:18:54
How long does it take to move your funds if you buy using a checking account through CashApp?
@_date: 2019-04-26 16:22:03
Do you still have the PC?
@_date: 2019-04-06 22:02:29
Great drawing, but Bitcoin isn’t going to see the moon for a loooong time. I guess they’ll be wearing that suit for a while. 
@_date: 2019-02-05 19:48:31
Day - from December to now
@_date: 2019-04-08 02:15:17
Nope. I have no clue. Just what I think. Hope I’m wrong.
@_date: 2019-04-11 01:15:10
Definitely! More than 20 times easily lol. I feel like an addict sometimes.
@_date: 2019-04-26 16:27:03
is that the PC the Bitcoin was stored on? I don’t believe there’s a way to recover. That really sucks!
@_date: 2019-04-26 16:45:03
I’ve thought about that myself. The chances are probably pretty low, but I’m sure there’s a lot out there with that stuff on it. Pawn shops are supposed to reformat computers before selling, so it would be harder. I doubt they’d let you install forensic software to inspect deleted info from the hard drive lol.
@_date: 2019-04-11 01:16:04
No kidding, it’s - tough habit to kick, especially if you trade a little.
@_date: 2019-04-06 22:37:32
I saw the drawing you showed on here a little bit ago. How did you scan it in so clearly? 
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:40:49
Awesome shoes - What are they?
@_date: 2019-04-27 03:08:13
Congrats, that’s awesome! I would love to have a full Bitcoin! Maybe some day.
@_date: 2019-04-07 03:28:46
Just about everyone wants this, but it’s not going to happen
@_date: 2019-04-22 03:09:17
This is from October?
@_date: 2019-04-06 22:40:29
lol true. I don’t think most people need to order Marijuana online though. Who knows?
@_date: 2019-04-11 01:49:46
Awesome! Thanks a lot :)
@_date: 2019-04-29 14:55:53
Bitcoin has always been on Exodus.
@_date: 2019-04-07 03:28:02
No way are we going to get another pump like we just had that soon
@_date: 2019-04-06 22:41:31
Awesome, thanks! 
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:25:52
Man, there are no words that will make you feel better. Probably the thought of hearing people saying “at least you have your life,”  and “it happened to all kinds of other,” probably makes your stomach turn. There are some promising alt coins out there you should research. If you can find a solid project you like and wait patiently for another few years, you may just make up for some of your losses and live a more comfortable life. Patient is definitely key at this point. Don’t give up! Ever! Nothing can be changed, but new choices can be made. I hope you get back on your feet and pull yourself out of depression.
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:17:42
As a currency - It’s peer to peer, borderless, you can send it internationally quicker and cheaper than traditional methods and there’s no middle man or woman holding funds until it clears. Aside from that, a lot of people like to speculate for hopeful profit. It’s not for everyone, but it makes perfect sense to the people use it and invests.
Btw, it’s least effective when used on the dark web because it’s more easily traceable than fiat. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:18:28
Did you buy cryptocurrency with that loan? I know a lot of people did that. Regardless, don’t consider suicide an option. There’s been multiple peak and dips in the history of crypto. Each peak being higher than the previous. I know it sucks, but no amount of money is worth the cost of suicide.  I have major depression and I’m extremely impatient and it’s hard to fight through it, but we have no choice. Unless someone is selling right now in hopes of buying back in at cheaper prices, I personally wouldn’t sell. Someone on the other side is buying what the others are selling for a reason. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:53:40
That’s what I figured lol
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:52:22
I really don’t know.  If I were a conspiracy theorist - I would say that the Wallstreet guys pushed up the price, so they could short it to the bottom. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:52:53
I know how that is, man! Thanks though!
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:55:14
I didn’t know if this was an official or unofficial screen name for the Craig S Wright. Anyone could use that name on here, so that’s what I was asking. It had nothing to do with believing whether you were a Dr. or not. 
@_date: 2018-11-26 23:05:23
Thanks a lot
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:21:24
Very true. I was specifically speaking of credit card debt. I have tons more that $20,000 in total debt and live paycheck to paycheck lol. It’s sucks. You’re statement is correct though. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 01:19:07
It does this if you buy with your checking account using a routing and account number. It usually doesn’t take as long as it says. Just until the check clears. Using debit cards are instant and can transfer instantly as well. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 02:25:34
Awesome, thanks!
@_date: 2018-11-27 03:29:18
I posted it. I guess we’ll see how it goes! Thanks again :)
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:29:00
@_date: 2019-01-24 00:35:07
No kidding, i’ve been waiting a couple weeks for it to drop, so i can buy more. It should be dumping any time now i think. 
@_date: 2018-11-27 00:34:38
I’m not sure about that haha. I’d like to sell it for 0.78 BTC - I bought it for $3400 new in March and I haven’t registered the warranty. Is this really Dr Craig Wright? haha 
@_date: 2019-01-03 03:44:09
How does this work and how much can you make approximately? I’ll have to research this some later, but any quick answers would be great. Thanks :)
@_date: 2019-01-02 00:49:16
it’s more than most have. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 23:38:17
this is laughable at this point! Lol No No No No haha. It would be great I think, but no. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 01:16:30
Come on, man. That was uncalled for and you know it. This guy came here for help. 
@_date: 2018-11-25 01:39:19
@_date: 2019-01-25 18:51:23
No, but it’s super boring right now! Honestly, idk if it’s the bottom. I finally some money to buy a dip and it’s not dipping! Wtf?! lol
@_date: 2019-01-03 03:47:53
Well, depending on cost, I probably would do this for free to help the network. 
@_date: 2019-01-15 15:47:59
Blood bath for sure 
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:16:10
That makes no sense. You can’t even spell “phone” and you expect us to believe you created  Bitcoin?! Haha. So many people make posts just like these. Who is to say that any of them aren’t the real Satoshi?
@_date: 2019-01-04 20:09:33
Mine is normally 3-5 days. I can’t imagine it being 18 days, unless they’re backed from a huge amount of ACH purchases.... and I don’t think that’s the case. It could also be a new thing they started with new customers. It’s really hard to say. I believe you can still sell it on the app and buy something else on the app, even though you can’t transfer it. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:18:06
Then why did you say that you could careless if we believed you or not? You’re making no sense. This is fun though lol. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 04:33:34
Which is super close :(
@_date: 2019-01-04 00:37:58
not going to happen lol - I’m hopeful, yet full of doubt. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 23:33:18
There’s almost 4 million Bitcoin that are lost forever that can’t be sold, plus the 1 million in Satoshi’s wallet. So, I don’t know about that. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 04:21:43
Not a noob. I’m talking about a whole bear to start of bull cycle. Here’s the dates
January 11, 2012 - July 11, 2012: 185 days
August 7, 2012 - December 6th, 2012: 111 days
November 29, 2013 - Jan 7th, 2015: 415 days
415 days is 13.8 months and we’re close to that now. 
@_date: 2019-01-25 15:58:16
I can agree with that. I’m not really trying time the bottom, i’m just expecting it to go down some soon instead of up. If that doesn’t happen, then I’ll DCA. 
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:43:50
You’re right. Maybe this is it. The Bottom? 
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:44:12
That would be scary and delightful at the same time lol
@_date: 2019-01-16 04:35:41
I do a little 
@_date: 2019-01-25 18:50:09
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:50:42
Come on - I think you really believe yourself. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:21:31
Okay, i’ll believe you. Send me 1 Bitcoin to help me and my family. If you have 1000s of Bitcoin and you’re such a generous guy, then 1 single Bitcoin would be no problem. 
@_date: 2019-01-21 15:39:08
No way would this happen
@_date: 2019-01-24 15:03:11
Yeah, that’s what i’m afraid of! I’m tempted to buy now, but worried it’s going to drop right after. 
@_date: 2019-01-01 04:24:43
@_date: 2018-11-26 20:23:15
For the ones who don’t believe in the tech - I don’t understand why you’re posting here other than to troll. It’s one thing to ask about why it’s good for this or that, but no point in cursing and yelling at the people who enjoy this space. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:58:52
When is Bitcoin going to recover? You said you’ve made accurate predictions. Curious to see what you say.
@_date: 2019-01-16 02:36:46
They have been for going on 14 months now. I guess they have considering a small amount of time. Overall since the beginning of Bitcoin, it would be no. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 01:57:12
Awesome, I hope it all works out for you!
@_date: 2019-01-05 23:28:29
No one can know this. Who knows? It could go to $30k USD by April this year.
@_date: 2019-01-04 21:30:58
Everything you read in forums that was written by Satoshi used punctuations and proper grammar. I’m the the grammar police, but this alone proves that you are not Satoshi. 
@_date: 2019-01-04 22:09:15
If you could care less if we believe you or not, then you wouldn’t be defending yourself on every post and saying you’re going to post everyday proving yourself. 
@_date: 2018-11-24 18:19:35
That’s not a bad idea! Glad to hear you have it under control! 
@_date: 2019-01-26 00:31:27
wow, thank you so much !
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:44:42
Well, i’m glad i did the price is now just above $8500
@_date: 2019-09-22 03:42:11
Yes, that would suck! lol Terribly!
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:44:58
Prove that they’re not....
@_date: 2019-09-23 23:19:09
It’s no burden to me. Doesn’t bother me a bit to not be able to prove something of such skepticism. Keep stressing yourself out over other people’s opinions or beliefs. I couldn’t care less, actually. :)
@_date: 2019-09-29 01:31:40
Just buy back when you can if you still believe in it when you’re able to buy. It’s okay to sell man.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:42:28
My proof is in play right now ;)
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:13:04
Figured you’d like to know that we’re bullish......
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:17:11
People really hate to hear anything bearish lol. it has nothing to do with a “tin foil hat” conspiracy theory. Everyone is just so dang bullish and in denial as well as scared of anything bearish happening. My statement is how I see the market right now. I could be right or could be wrong. You seem to be bullish - “tin foil hat” can just as easily and equally be applied to how you feel. I would love to see a huge bull run, but I don’t see it happening. That’s my opinion. .... and you’re right - I do comment and I’m active in a lot of alts. not all my comments are bearish. Anyway, it seems that Bakkt is really pushing the market up so far, huh? Lol
@_date: 2019-09-22 03:37:11
I don’t really think it’s plateaued, but I think institutions, regulators, etc., are preventing Bitcoin of it’s true potential and price discovery. I feel like if they wouldn’t have dipped their dirty hands in, it would have faster growth. .....,but who knows(?), this could just be part of the cycle that’s repeated a few times since it was created.
@_date: 2019-09-15 18:45:52
You’ve been in the space since 2013 and you’ve never heard of Segwit and Lightning Newtork? Those are what’s being worked on for scaling Bitcoin. If I misread your question, I apologize.
@_date: 2019-09-28 21:27:10
Institutions don’t FOMO. They accumulate when people are fearing the market when there’s big dips. They have more money than they need and have plenty of patience. My theory is - they spend 75% of their allotted amount for Bitcoin purchases on dips and when it’s time for the market to pump, they all through in their remaining 25% to pump their previous bags and once the retail FOMO buyers get in, they dump the market once they realize the market is close to peaking. My opinion and what I would do if I were wealthy enough to do this.
@_date: 2019-09-22 03:16:20
That makes a lot of sense and I agree with that. However, it’s like they’re stopping the price from rising too much and too fast. I’m not really frustrated about the price exactly. I’m frustrated at the fact that (if my conspiracy theory is true) institutional buyers, bankers, etc., are do exactly what you said, “taming the price.” It’s dirty (that’s an understatement) if that’s what they’re doing. The whole system is corrupt and is so afraid that the little guy might actually see a little financial light.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:40:26
It has nothing to do with what has happened previously.
@_date: 2019-09-26 16:45:20
How do you like my “tin foil hat” theory? Now below $8000. BTC is being controlled at an instutional level. Same thing happened after CME launched
@_date: 2019-09-22 03:40:58
I really enjoyed your response and I can’t disagree with anything you said.
@_date: 2019-09-24 19:43:36
What was your TA telling you? Look at the price now ;)
@_date: 2019-09-22 03:21:38
Yeah, it does look amazingly bullish zooming out. It just seems like the institutions are shaking the tree out of apples and doing it very slowly. I feel like they’re controlling the price even though - they say they want to prevent manipulation in the market when they’re the ones doing it.
@_date: 2019-09-22 03:32:58
I know some basic TA. I know there’s a wedge (if you don’t cut off the wicks) that we’re almost to the end of. I also know that if you do cut off the wicks that it’s a descending triangle, though I feel that’s not as accurate - also that this wedge is at the start of a substantial uptrend as opposed to fall of 2018 when a similar pattern formed when it fell 50% that was towards the end of a bear market. However, TA doesn’t account for severe manipulation (by institutions and the like) and price suppression, which is what irritates me.  It’s like they’re controlling the growth and manipulating true price discovery for their benefit. They’re afraid of Bitcoin and they can print unlimited money to control it. Eventually, though I could see that Bitcoin could possibly soak up a lot of the endless supply of USD.
@_date: 2019-09-23 01:32:01
It’s not going to. they’re shorting and longing with over the counter Bitcoin. if anything, they’re the ones that ran the price up to $10,000 so they can’t short the crap out of it. the little bull run is over and I doubt we’ll ever see a new high again, especially anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-09-25 00:13:04
You would be right if that happened. I bought some back, but my opinion - there will be plenty of opportunity to buy around this price, so I’m going to place an order for $7000 and just leave it open. It would suck if it doesn’t fill and I lose out on gains, but we can’t know 100% what any market is going to do.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:27:15
Yeah, i think there will be plenty of opportunities to buy. However, we did just fill the CME “gap” around $8500. They have another gap around $11500. Maybe it’ll go back there momentarily? Apparently, they’ve never had a gap not get filled. A lot of people thought this didn’t apply to Bitcoin as well as myself, but it just might.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:34:12
I doubt anytime even remotely soon.
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:14:41
Be careful! People don’t like to hear the bearish truth lol. I can’t disagree with that.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:20:31
I agree with you! It only gives the big guys more control. People don’t like to hear a realist point of view though. lol
@_date: 2019-05-04 15:53:58
How is this off topic? It has to do directly with Bitcoin? lol However, I don’t believe they know who Satoshi is/are.
@_date: 2019-05-24 13:14:27
Well, I can’t disagree that it’s getting extremely mainstream. However, for right now - I think it’s great that the biggest mobile provider out there is accepting BTC and BCH regardless of the method they use. I wouldn’t want to pay a phone bill with Crypto though lol. That could potentially become and damn expensive phone bill haha.
@_date: 2019-05-20 00:57:43
lol Now way!
@_date: 2019-05-29 22:05:17
lol not anytime soon
@_date: 2018-12-31 01:08:45
Awesome! I’m joining now! 
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:35:31
Yep, I can agree with that
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:32:43
Hasn’t there been hundreds of bull traps this year though? lol
@_date: 2018-12-01 23:51:48
I can’t find a place either. I’m trying to sell a PRS custom 24 and had resort to Reverb as usual. 
@_date: 2019-05-24 02:40:50
Yeah, i don’t mind that though.
@_date: 2018-12-30 17:38:57
That’s sucks man. Unfortunately, the only way to get them off is to verify ;( I hate that it’s like that. Everyone makes mistakes, no matter how smart they think they might be. This should be a place for help without worry of being ridiculed. Sorry man. Even the people in here giving you grief has made mistakes and will continue doing so, no matter how much research they do. You made an honest mistake, it happens to everyone. I wish there were away around your issue. 
@_date: 2019-05-14 12:24:26
lol no way. I’d love to see it as much as most people, but this thing has to cool sometime soon. My opinion. Wow!
@_date: 2019-05-25 01:57:07
You are accurate. As most huge corporations start to accept Bitcoin, this will likely be the process because it’s so volatile. Still awesome though, I think. Again, you’re exactly right. I misread your original comment. I apologize :)
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:45:36
I hate that credit cards have a say in what we can buy or not buy. I could go to a strip club and spend $400 on a vip room and $2000 on gambling and the credit card companies think that’s okay, but not buying bitcoin? I’d love to be able to cancel mine and and tell them it’s because they block bitcoin purchases. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:08:07
......,but when is the right time to be greedy? Some probably thought when it hit around $3780 today was a good time to get greedy. Now, it’s $3400 just hours later lol. Wow, this sucks. 
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:25:53
Do you hodl and how many big dips have you seen?
@_date: 2019-05-24 02:38:35
Oh, I see now. You can actually pay directly from your wallet with BTC OR BCH. That’s awesome.
@_date: 2018-12-27 23:57:54
Why do you think this is a good time to buy? How can anyone know that? 
@_date: 2018-12-25 15:03:53
@_date: 2018-12-15 18:10:24
lol awesome case
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:23:23
Bitcoin is going to go up or down the same amount it would in any wallet? Are you asking what is the safest? If so, check out hardware wallets like someone on here mentioned.
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:20:12
This is terrible! I feel for you! However, your story just now probably made 1000’s of people who invested less feel a little better. You probably made a bunch of other people realize that their situation could always be worse. I hope everything works out for you man - mainly the wife and kids. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 23:57:42
Not at this moment lol
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:24:19
One can hope. Such a crazy market!
@_date: 2018-12-19 15:02:29
Man, i have the same debt! It freaking sucks. I lost a really good job a few years back and had to run up credit cards. 
@_date: 2018-12-29 16:38:17
It’s amazing how many kids know so much about Bitcoin! Just do a bunch of research and make your decision. 
@_date: 2018-12-07 01:10:08
If someone asked me to guess what percentage of people invested more than they could afford to lose - I would guess about 80% just from seeing them on all the social media platforms. It doesn’t mean anyone is stupid. It means they were wishful, hoping for a chance and made bad timing decision. It sucks and it’s an expensive mistake, but I wouldn’t say anyone is stupid for it. 
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:09:06
It should be excluded. There should be a separate set of rule for cryptocurrency that doesn’t mess with innovation. How can they not see that? 
@_date: 2019-05-25 21:31:52
Not anytime soon
@_date: 2019-05-12 19:21:29
Not anytime soon. My opinion.
@_date: 2018-12-20 19:33:17
Thanks a lot! I’ve been meaning to research more on this. Does it pay?
@_date: 2018-12-21 05:11:15
No way. We’ve seen this too many times 
@_date: 2018-12-20 13:27:11
The bull run most likely isn’t starting (opinion), so don’t worry about it lol. 
@_date: 2018-12-18 01:41:53
I want it to go up, but this is just another bounce before hitting another yearly low :(
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:02:25
I’m interested in CoinCola
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:48:00
lol no kidding. Won’t see that again for while. There’s no way it’s going to keep going up this quickly.
@_date: 2018-12-23 04:02:54
If you’re in the US you can use Coinbase, Gemini or Abra. All have apps. 
@_date: 2018-12-31 17:50:16
No kidding. That’s a lot though - I can’t even afford .25 Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-12-30 18:52:14
Maybe you could make a “CryptoHelpNoJudgement” sub lol. I would join, People need a place to go for questions. Even we research we can never have all the answers
@_date: 2018-12-31 01:06:45
A guy my friend works with is going to buy $400k of Bitcoin tonight!!!! 
@_date: 2018-12-17 22:09:26
As nice as this would be..... The market does have good days and has a lot of them since this bear market. Yet, the market just keeps going lower. Just because Bitcoin went up almost 10% today, doesn’t mean we’ve hit the bottom nor does it mean a bull run. I’d love to agree with you, but I don’t think it’s going to happen right now. 
@_date: 2018-12-19 14:41:31
It’s going back down from what I can tell :(......
@_date: 2019-05-23 00:48:22
Possibly the Hackers that stole 7000 Bitcoin from Binance just sold them for a 70% discount. 
Read about it here and see what you think? 
@_date: 2018-12-28 19:27:14
abra app
@_date: 2018-12-29 03:50:54
Damn, you’re 14?! Freaking amazing response! 
@_date: 2019-05-29 23:26:29
We had been going for about a year straight before that though. We’re barely crawling out right now.
@_date: 2019-05-24 14:17:14
You should be able to pay from any wallet without a Bitpay account now. They’re just using them as a payment processor. Once you click “Bitpay” as the payment option, you select the amount you want to pay. Then it gives you the option to use BTC or BCH. Once you select one, a QR code pops up for you to send you BTC or BCH.
@_date: 2018-12-20 20:39:35
We’ll right back down to $3500 in a hours :(......
@_date: 2018-12-18 04:13:05
It’s mostly trash. Just a guess - whether it’s educated or uneducated, no one knows. It’s a guessing game and that’s my thought. 
@_date: 2019-05-24 15:13:12
You don’t have to have Bitpay. You can use any wallet. Bitpay is mechant used to process the payment. Att gives you a QR code to send your BTC or BCH to directly. I don’t care how it works after that. I posted screenshots yesterday on this Bitcoin Reddit if you want to go back and look at them.
@_date: 2018-12-20 21:05:44
lol no kidding. I guess we’ll have to see. I’m not feeling too good about it though. We’ve gotten our hopes up too many times.
