Hopefully they move directly to supporting Lightning. If I understand Lightning correctly, wouldn't the Amazon marketplace be a perfect implentation? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 20:10:46
Would this example be an arguement for keeping blocksize small?
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:56:26
One of the main criticisms of Lightning network is that 'users will never open channels' but I'm waiting a large company like Amazon to adopt it.  So if you are an existing Amazon account holder, you immediately have a channel open for you.  Any new accounts get lightning channels opened as well. Users wouldn't even know they were on the lightning network.  I'm not sure if that's part of the vision or even possible but imagine the amount of commerce that would take place using bitcoin.

It's interesting that it's never brought up for sure. Most people, including myself, don't think Craig is Satoshi but there's enough fishy smell about his attachment to Dave Kleiman (who from what I understand is pretty highly respected) that I don't think this Tulip Trust should be completely ignored. But what do I know I guess.

The Dave Kleiman / Craig Wright one that supposedly releases Satoshi's coins to 'someone'. I think it's sometime in 2020?

Pretty much every person who's been around bitcoin since before 2015 has heard about this. 
@_date: 2018-08-17 23:33:37
Let's put aside the opinion that Craig is a douchebag (opinion) and that Satoshi was "too smart" for a second. The scenario outlined in that forum seems really unlikely. What seems more likely, considering all that has happened surrounding Craig Wright, is that there was some involvement in the project and that there is something to this Tulip Trust. In any case, I believe it deserves at least some cautious attention.
Edit: To clarify, I'm no fan of Craig Wright. He blocked me on twitter before it was cool to be blocked!

It's kind of a circular argument. The late Dave Kleiman's possible involvement has never really been criticized. If Kleiman was Satoshi, the fact that Craig Wright is a fraud is irrelevant. The terms of the trust release Satoshi's coins to him.

Like I said...I know nothing.  Less than nothing but wouldn't it just be a matter of building an additional layer on top of existing wallet protocals? Like file naming or folder building? The drag and drop utility could be PIN protected and would basically execute the 'send/receive' functions underneath?
Visually it seems like the wallet builders are kind of basking in their own creation, not wanting to hide the fact that they've taken something incredibly complex and made it 'easier'.  'Easier' doesn't necessarily mean 'easy'.

No counterfeiting, no transaction fees for using international ATM machines, No exchange rate fees imposed by the banks for buying local currency, no mid-trip credit card freezes because Visa flagged you as in Mexico and fraudulent unnecessarily (yes it happened to me)

If bitcoin does start to displace fiat currency then the $100,000 bitcoin seems inevitable. If the value of one bitcoin was equivalent to the current value of $100,000USD, nobody would care about USD.   At what point the does comparison with fiat become irrelevant?
@_date: 2014-12-30 16:10:09
I don't think it works that way.  How would you explain the funds used to make the original purchase? How is the money you received from the secondary sale any cleaner than the money you had in the first place?
I believe "good old fashioned way of laundering money" would involve taking out some sort of loan to buy a business that generates cash revenue.  Then you fudge the revenue numbers and slowly inject the uncleaned cash into the business for withdrawal.
@_date: 2014-10-05 16:13:19
Wow...missing the point.  Nothing exchanged on Forex has any additional utility to ownership than standard fiat and precious metals currently have.

No. Forex is still trading basically zero utility. Bitcoin is trading ownership in utility. 
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:38:26
Sure. I didn't say it was impossible to compare the 2 however, you have to admit that there are many variables involved with the owning crypto that are not relevant to traditional trading of commodities and fiat currency. If you can't admit that then we will have to agree to disagree.

I want someone to build a drag and drop interface wallet where a user can navigate in and out of inputs like they would a folder directory. You could drag and drop inputs to consolidate them visually. You could navigate into consolidations and see the individual inputs. You could build a receiving end that merchants could post along side products and simply drag your wallet inputs onto the item you want to buy. 
It would be way easier for newcomers to deal with mentally even if they had to enter a pin on every drag and drop. transfer. Or even a timeout pin like mobile banking?

You are way off topic. My point was that applying chart behaviors from  traditional stock trading doesn't necessarily apply to bitcoin (or any new emerging better transactional currency that you are alluding to) because owning stocks does not provide the same type of utility.
@_date: 2014-08-30 20:00:18
The words are not arbitrary though. The word 'coin' in most contexts is a well used singular noun which is the root of the problem. It doesn't make sense to people. Change the lowest denomination to bitcoin and the rest takes care of itself. It would have been better if the word 'coin' wasn't used at all. 
@_date: 2014-09-30 02:06:14
Because at 10 cents per bitcoin, people would have to use more of them to achieve the same value of transaction. The lower the fiat value of bitcoin, the lower the maximum fiat value of transactions possible in a defined period of time. Utility will dictate adoption and adoption will dictate price once things shake out.

Maybe tumble the entire batch of coins from the known address forever dissolving the phenomenon.

There was only one senator who seemed completely clueless..."I don't think the banks are going to let this happen."  I could see Andreas biting his tongue as I was cheering "Shove it in his face!!"

@_date: 2017-02-02 17:07:09
The biggest hurdle I had was re-conceptualizing the use of the word 'coin'.  There's too much deep rooted tribal knowledge concerning the word 'coin'.  To this day, people ask me about the current value of bitcoin and no matter what number I say, their first response is always "For one?!"
I wish Satoshi had named the largest denomination a 'Satoshi' and the smallest denomination a 'bitcoin'.  It would have made way more sense in the long run.

@_date: 2015-01-07 17:31:47
I'm probably misunderstanding but do you honestly think the majority of the people in the world are going to verify where the bitcoin came from before accepting it by constantly checking the blockchain or adding blacklisted addresses to their payment processing?

I guess the part I don't understand is that there is a 'clear' solution to the congestion problem already in increasing block size.  I mean once ADSL was introduced, it was a forward direction on it's implementation.  So if a blocksize increase doesn't happen, aren't we just in the same boat once Lightning transactions become the new norm? If mass adoption occurs with the intro of segwit and off chain transactions, won't there be slow processing and high fees on the main chain once again for settlement?  Apologies, I'm just trying to make sense of it all from a user standpoint.

This is harmful in my opinion. 1 bitcoin is completely arbitrary to an ounce of gold. If people falsely believe that bitcoin is worth more than gold (which it is nowhere near at this point), it creates a psychological barrier for the price to go higher.

After tirelessly trying to understand both sides of the blocksize debate it's become obvious that I lack the technical knowledge to take a stance either way.  What I have seen however is that one side of the debate is simply impatient.  They don't want to suffer any negative short term effects for the bigger picture.  The opposing side seems to recognize there are bumps in the road but they are willing to trudge through them for the sake of a larger vision. Thanks to for helping me see the light.

The problem in my mind is the word 'coin'.  People always think it's a singular thing.

Yes it was.  Fees were only supposed to be part of the mining compensation once transactions were on a world wide adoption level.  Making transactions expensive while adoption was still taking place was not the intention. Why have we been listening to the 'Western Union is going down!" campaigns because of the huge reduction in costs for cross border remittances? Were people just making that shit up?  
@_date: 2016-06-13 22:50:00
Why would this be a troll?  I'm serious. I try to tell people that a bitcoin is worth $700 and they look at me as if to say '$700 For only one?' Then I gotta go into this long drawn out explanation about it's divisibility etc. If we don't adopt one of the smaller units of measure as the standard, prices for goods and services are going to be like: .00574
@_date: 2016-06-15 18:19:25
Bitcoin is changing so fast that I have a real problem explaining it's benefits to newcomers.
Have we already reached the stage where 'almost free' transactions have come to an end?  I mean adoption is very small and yet fees are already creeping up to the point where if you don't include enough of a fee, reliability, speed and savings go out the window?  The targeted problems that bitcoin supposedly solves are constantly changing. How do we get new adoption unless it's by speculative investors?

Ya I agree but maybe they are just being pragmatic. It's not that bitcoin won't deliver. It's that everyone got so hyped about its potential that they forgot there may be real world challenges to overcome first.
I've always felt that businesses building on bitcoin's promise now may be premature. 
@_date: 2016-06-13 22:53:32
I'm dead serious.  It would have been way easier to explain to people that 'bitcoin' is the smallest denomination rather than the largest.  It's not so much a problem right now but imagine the complexity of pricing something if bitcoin is ever worth $10,000. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 21:37:07
Totally agree.  My first few times saddle stitching shell resulted in pull-throughs from me putting too much tension on the stitch.  It's weird that way. I know kangaroo is supposed to be one of the strongest leathers but how do you find it holds up in the long run?  My current mandate is to create wallets that last a lifetime so I've been making them out of full Horween shell. Would love to make them thinner if durability isn't an issue.

I actually don't think bitcoin or any fork of Bitcoin, will be used for small payments until the collapse of the fiat system.

IMO, it's pretty clear that BCC/BCH/Bcash doesn't have the social momentum or organization to ever abscond the name Bitcoin.  I actually believe it's to their detriment to even try.  Even if at some point Bcash does manage to gain majority hash power, it would be a step backwards to call it bitcoin.

It's a philosophical argument dude.  Like I said, I don't care about how you feel about animals, the planet or your specific plan for saving humanity. I eat FOOD and that includes MEAT.  If you don't want to eat meat who am I to tell you otherwise?  Like I said, the only ethical thing you can do with your mindset is stop eating.
P.S.  Because I've now been labelled a plant life advocate, here's a story for you.  , I was out hunting moose the other day.  Those filthy things kill too many plants.  I came across a giant bull moose in a meadow just ravaging the vegetation.  How dare he.  So, I blasted him right behind the shoulder with a 30-30.  Dropped dead on the spot.  Saved the lives of hundreds of plants.  Then, because I didn't want waste, I butchered the moose for dinner.  Ironically, I thought he'd taste delicious with a salad so I went to the grocery store and bought a bunch of dead plants and made a delicious salad. See how that works bud?

I know of some local farms in Canada that bring in seasonal workers from Mexico each fall.  One of the owners told me that a concern for some of his seasonal workers is corruption in Mexico once the workers go back home IE. cartel members demanding a cut of the foreign workers pay upon their first visit to their home bank.  I have no direct experience with this but it's something I've heard from the owner several times now.  It would be amazing if he could pay the workers in USD and have them receive digital currency outside of their bank.  I guess a lot depends on the currency power of bitcoin in Mexico.

Are you fucking this daft? I DON'T CARE about plant life any more or less than I care about animal life. I'm not the one trying to push my ethical beliefs on others. Your privilege is so obvious yet you don't see it. People who are starving don't have the luxury of pushing a social agenda about what should and shouldn't be eaten.
I eat FOOD. When one organism gets eaten, it's life ends and supports the life of the organism that ate it.  If you are unwilling to accept that reality, the only ethical choice for you is to stop eating... please do.

@_date: 2017-08-11 14:39:06
I see what you are saying now. I think there will always be a number of coins created for different uses. Take precious metals for instance. There's old favorites like gold silver and platinum and then there's other metals like lead, iron, etc. Theoretically they can all be exchanged for one another but it doesn't mean gold has less value for the purpose it suits.

Thanks.  So let's say that segwit never existed or at least wasn't going to be activated any time soon. If BTCash had forked anyway, would there be a higher probability that they could overtake the original bitcoin chain?  IE. Is segwit the only saving grace for this particular take-over attempt?

There's alot to learn. I don't think anyone here wants to walk someone through it. It's complicated and accountability should be solely on the user. This means apps, businesses and people on the internet should be approached with 'buyer beware' in mind. Do your own digging. It will make all the difference.

I agree.  When I got into bitcoin a few years ago, I sent lots of small transactions back an forth between wallets just to learn. I practiced with cold storage, moving funds, re-securing it in Armory, shared bitcoin with friends, ran demonstrations, etc. How could any newbie do this today?  The time it would take and the amount of transaction fee involved would be completely off-putting.  I personally would have given up and probably not looked back if the current situation existed when I first started.

In my opinion the confirmations are just a luxury.  It wasn't that long ago that credit cards were processed using a manual imprint on carbon paper.

After a re-read,

Scronty, sitting on the sidelines disgruntled since the publication of the white paper, is attempting to put the pieces of the puzzle together by explaining that neither Wright nor Kleiman are the true creators. There is little danger to Scronty since all evidence has been destroyed or will be denied by (3) who has backed himself into a corner.

Fair enough but that is beside the point. The point is, if improvements to the protocol cannot be activated because nobody can ever agree, it reduces the probability that developers will even bother.

I always believed that the terms bitcoin and Satoshi should be reversed in denomination. A Satoshi being the largest denomination and a bitcoin being the smallest.

Just curious as I've never cashed out any bitcoin through Circle but how does it show up in your bank statement? Like an e-transfer?  Or is it like a payment credit or something?  I'm also curious how cashing out would show up on a credit card?

Seriously, who's the troll here?  I started my posts with a literal explanation of my experiences. You are here toting all these concepts like financial sovereignty and anti-censorship while accusing me of being a pyramid schemer? If you believe in all of those concepts you outlined why DON'T you want more people to get on board?  Your stance so far makes no sense.

You sound like you think I'm arguing?  I was just asking.  The last thing I believe the community wants at this point is more in-fighting and another forked chain in November. I don't care one way or the other but I happen to trust the Core dev side more than the other.
@_date: 2016-11-24 23:01:19
Youre probably right. So wouldn't it be beneficial to be able to get people educated and using bitcoin? I don't understand why 'so and so' is trying to paint me the pyramid scheme bad guy?

Haha, dude.... you put alot of effort into a long reply in a thread that NOBODY is actually taking seriously. I believe bitcoin will go higher than it's current price but it doesn't mean I'm not trying to buy on down swings if I can.
@_date: 2019-10-31 20:16:23
The amount of bitcoin you own (% of savings) should be directly proportional to the amount you have learned about the technology and it's value proposition.  Otherwise, you will not be able to sustain the volatility swings and get rekt.  Learn then buy.  Learn more buy more (or less depending on whether or not you believe in what you learn).

I use OpenVPN config files to load the tunnel directly into the router. All traffic by default routes through the VPN but on my router, I have options to route specific devices to go through the ISP instead. On the flip side I can configure other devices so that if the VPN goes down, it blocks all traffic. All other devices will route through the VPN by default but if the service goes down they will reroute through the ISP.

Why can't bitcoin follow the same path as gold? What am I missing here?  The problem is that most people here want to get rich quick and therefore need bitcoin to be used as a currency 'today'.

Is there not a law preventing owners of domains from negatively hi-jacking the business they claim to represent?  Like, I can't own pepsi.com and legally point it to pornography websites.
I'm not sure who would be the legally represented victims here but the law is the law is it not?
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:46:23
That's not what I am saying at all. My point is that whether or not a person is rich or poor, it will always be harder for them to part with something that is gaining in value (bitcoin) before something that is losing value (fiat). In that way, bitcoin is flawed as a daily transaction medium for small purchases (for now). The benefit of holding it outweighs the desire to spend it. Especially with inflationary alternatives  still being mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 02:43:05
Gavin and Hearn, at some point a couple years ago, had mapped out the approximate time that the network would come to a halt if we didn't increase blocksize (was supposed to happen roughly a year ago). A few months later  Hearn quit. Fast forward to the present and... wait, I already said that. 
I'm not going bother finding an exact reference. It's common knowledge.

You're missing my point. I want that to. I want bitcoin to be the world reserve currency. It could also support less secure tokens like gift cards, loyalty points and coupons. Because of bitcoins deflationary nature, it could also play a part in long term savings. Think about it, why would you ever spend an appreciating asset on a hamburger or toilet paper regardless of speed or transaction fee? You wouldn't. In that way, bitcoin is better suited as a store of value.

*"In December 1997, the cease and desist letter stating, "... we do not challenge your right to pursue it or to exercise your First Amendment rights, but we do challenge your right to use the White House, the President, and the First Lady as a marketing device. For adult internet users, that device is, at the least, part of a deceptive scheme.

I'm with you man.

The whole 'coffee' thing should maybe be looked at in a different context. An individual purchasing a coffee MAY not need top notch security however the total value of coffee purchases on the planet is absolutely worth securing.

Fair point but in the coffee scenario you just illustrated, you and the selling merchant were the ones at fault;  the merchant for not giving you enough coffee and you for accepting it.  The same amount of cash exchanged hands for the same exact cost and the same exact network speed. It really has nothing to do with the social contract concerning the value or authenticity of the money.

I'm literally asking for some help on how lightning works. My understanding is that the transactions on lighting channels are conglomerates into one bug settlement on the bitcoin blockchain. Who processes the settlement? Who pays the final transaction fee? Is it pretty collected on lightning and then passed on for settlement. I don't get it.

Thank you so much.  I'm not sure I make 100% sense of it but that explanation went a long way.  
  
So if I am paying the transaction fee on the eventual main chain settlement, how does LN make transactions cheaper? 1 transaction fee as opposed to several?
@_date: 2016-09-29 02:34:22
I wonder what that does to the value of bitcoin? As more LN chains take up the transaction load, wouldn't the value of bitcoin tank because settlements on the main chain would become less critical?

Ahh I see. Well, the original 'Origins' pieces were published here on reddit.  That's actually the first time I've seen it posted outside of this community. He and I had several conversations through PM in which I told him straight-up that I found his self-representation a bit awkward. After confiding in me that very few people had even bothered to contact him about the story, perhaps he took my comments to heart and adjusted his writing when he published the above account at a later date.  Who knows.  It could also just be my interpretation gone wrong.  I wanted to believe him but there was something in his writing (the original) that didn't quite sit right with me. I do believe we are starting to get closer to the truth.

No, but the less innovative the technology turns out to be, the higher the probability that governments will just control/ ban/ignore it. The more innovative it is, the less they will be able to control it and the higher the incentive becomes to adopt it. It comes down to how innovative the blockchain actually turns out to be. It's yet to be seen.

To me it comes down to whether or not the innovation of the blockchain is as disruptive as we all think it is.  If it is, governments are only hurting themselves by squashing it.  If it turns out not to be the be-all/end-all of financial disruption, governments will just follow China's lead and impose stern punishments for lawbreakers.

You should read all of his detailed accounts of the project. They are posted somewhere here in 2 or 3 parts. It's VERY interesting.

@_date: 2017-09-28 17:33:57
As cool headed you have been in responding here, I still get the distinct impression that the whole 2x debate is simply a battle of wills.  You say Core has done nothing for scaling? Who invented/coded segwit in the first place? To bulk every contributing coder into one Borg mindset is a bit convenient.  Do you think it's a coincidence/conspiracy that the majority of the most experienced bitcoin coders in the world think that 2x is a bad idea?
Segwit is working and as adoption continues, it will work even better. Statistics are showing that scaling is happening and will continue to happen without forking the network at a critical time in bitcoin's history. Why is it that a 2x hardfork has to happen right now? Because you don't want to break an agreement?  What about breaking confidence in the system?

haha...I'm guessing that I don't.
@_date: 2015-09-05 18:29:54
Yes.  Thank you.  It's making sense now.  The confusion originated from downloading wallet software and each of them had always recommended .0001 as a transaction fee (2104-2015). So not understanding the fundamentals behind that recommendation, I was confused as to where that number came from.
@_date: 2015-09-05 17:41:30
Hmm.  Even without a conversion to fiat, .0001btc is .0001btc.  So whether I convert to fiat or convert to the amount of goods &amp; services that 1 btc can buy, the more a btc is worth, the more .0001btc becomes.
I've been interested in bitcoin for a little over a year but this is one concept that has always eluded me.
@_date: 2015-09-27 04:17:51
I don't think that's how mining difficulty works. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 20:20:40
Seems reasonable. 
@_date: 2015-09-05 18:10:19
So as more transactions can be included in blocks, the fee will naturally decrease based on a less competitive atmosphere? Does that mean that wallet providers will build in different criterion for recommended fees?  That's where this conversation originated.  Since I've been involved, a .0001btc has always seem to have been 'recommended' and I was wondering where that number came from.

Fair enough but couldn't there be forks of bitcoin still named bitcoin if the future is for it to be invisible to the user?  BitcoinDaily, BitcoinRemittance, BitcoinTrade ?  I'm just spit balling but to me as a non technical user, designating the use case of each fork but retaining bitcoin in the name makes way more sense.

But then a hacker would have had to hack at least 2 databases I was member to, attempt to match them up and then if parts did match attempt to extrapolate the formula of the remaining characters?  How likely that is? For the differing characters you could come up with a protocol alot less obvious. The one I actually use is complex but for this example I was just trying to demonstrate a point. So many people I know use the same password for everything because they dont want to remember passwords. It's gotta be way better than that. 
@_date: 2016-10-13 20:48:29
How would an attacker know you were using a protocal in the first place? If you make the password protocal difficult enough, I don't see how it would be any different than a random password.  Even if the characters at the end have little to do with the required service it's still completely random to anyone who doesn't know the protocal.
(LastLetter of required service)(first5digitsofPhoneNumber)(PredefinedSymbol1)(Last3digitsofPhoneNumber)(predefinedsymbol2)(StreetYouLiveonespelledbackwards)(predifinedsymbol3)(firstSyllabalof required sevrice minus first letter in all caps except second last letter)
For Circle:
For reddit it would be:
You can have very complex passwords that even if you didn't change would be difficult to hack. AND all you have to remember is the protocal.
@_date: 2016-10-29 18:05:31
Ya, I was thinking that maybe each print could have a unique bitcoin address derived from a single master seed.  The question then becomes, how does the owner verify that the public key stuck on their print was derived from the appropriate master without verification from me personally.  I'm a noob so please excuse me if what I just typed makes no sense at all ;)  
  
Also, I'm not looking for my work to be super valuable and more trying to make authenticity an added value to owning the prints.

@_date: 2016-10-13 20:08:51
Does anyone else use a pre determined protocal for their passowrds so that you can have a different password for every service but never have to remember any of them?  For example:
(ImportantBirthdate1)(predetermined symbol1)(ImportantBirthdate2)(predetermined symbol2)(1st syllable of the relevant service capitalized)
The password would look something like this for Circle:
And it would look like this for Coinbase

Something is definitely notable about this situation but I wouldn't necessarily say it "stinks" quite yet.

Could you consider the private keys the ownership and the public keys as proof?
@_date: 2016-10-12 18:03:35
I don't really understand why there aren't more forks of bitcoin?  Is it solely because nobody is willing to discard the 'bitcoin' name?  I mean, if what many are saying is true in that the future use of blockchains will be invisible to the user, why does it matter?  Won't people just develop applications on top of whatever chain they want while the user has no idea? For example, I use my credit card for large purchases that I might not necessarily have the cold hard cash for.  It gives me flexibility to pay it off at any rate I wish.  I use a debit card for smaller purchases that consume my bank balance directly.  The point is that the process of using those 2 services is still virtually identical.  I present my card and punch in my PIN number.

I think the main proposition of value is based on the premise that anything that two or more party's agree has value, has value.  For example:  There is no fundamental difference between the paper and ink used to create a $20 bill vs. a $10 bill.  The value difference is in the implied agreement. Assuming an agreement as ridiculous as that can be transferred to something digital, bitcoin could have value simply because of it's fixed supply compared to printed notes and fiat money.  Then pile on the other values that bitcoin can offer in the way of the immutable ledger, smart contracts, cross border transactions, etc.

Buffer's check example is actually a good one. Checks and money orders do not have any value but that's only because they have infinite supply. If there were a finite number if checks and money orders in circulation, they would have intrinsic value.

You need to tweak your sarcasm sensor bud. It was just a tongue in cheek joke.  I have no grandios visions of bitcoin bringing the third world out of their situation.  That was, however, an idea that had a great deal of traction for a long time in the bitcoin community. Just take it easy man.

I disagree. Some of the most valuable paintings in the world are not being charged for to see. They are locked in away in peoples vaults and have value to the owners for any number of reasons. Things are valuable because at some given point in time 2 parties agree they are.  That is it. Certain items get more parties agreeing about value than others. It's not all about transaction frequency or mass adoption.

@_date: 2017-07-17 18:00:34
Do you think there will even be a need to fight the 2x part if segwit activates? My interpretation was that this whole heated debate was based on the fact that confirmation times were too slow and fees were too high?  If segwit alleviates those two issues, doesn't the desire to hard fork for a measly 1mb blocksize increase drift away?
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:04:32
That's what I think too.  I think Craig (and a few others) were somehow involved but in the wake of Kleiman's (holder of the private keys) passing  and the explosion of the bitcoin price, Wright is trying to scrounge as much involvement as possible in order to take an undeserved place on the throne.

Hmmm, I guess I don't really understand the role of the miners or the process by which data other than bitcoin monetary transactions get's locked in the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:44:48
Not really but you strike me as the selling type so my advice to you would be to....sell.
@_date: 2017-07-08 05:09:17
Apologies. I assumed you were connected to the show. 
Vitalik has dozens of popular videos on the Internet. Any mildly informed crypto hobbiest would know he does not have a Russian accent. It just demonstrates the complete disconnect from the crypto sphere. Especially considering they are basing an entire radio production to the topic. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 05:06:23
So this is your only response to his post? Did you intentionally gloss over everything he just said or did it happen naturally?  
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:55:17
Thank you. As a simple bitcoin user, I still feel a bit vulnerable when it comes to these debates. Even after being part of the community for almost 4 years. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 02:11:28
The guests are always knowledgeable however the hosts are clueless. In my opinion you would have to have a very limited knowledge of crypto to find that podcast interesting. Not trying to insult. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:28:05
Yes but have you ever tried moving bitcoin between a paper wallet and the exchange?  It's impossible without continually building a new paper wallet.  With a hardware wallet, the coins can move from cold storage to an exchange and back again.  
I like to trade but I wouldn't leave the coins on the exchange for any longer than it takes to execute my trade. And I don't want to have to make a new paper wallet every time I use the private key to sign a transaction. What am I missing here?  Hardware wallets facilitate safe easy use of bitcoin.  Currently there is a hardware wallet shortage.  Therefore, there are less people willing to risk investing in bitcoin. (Yes I realize they are probably ignorant and not informed but that's beside the point.)
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:35:57
Agreed.  It doesn't change the fact that I know people who are waiting for a hardware device before they part with their precious fiat.  It's a thing... people are scared to learn and if they can rely on a device to make them feel safer, they will.  Sadly, I hypothesize that there are thousands of people waiting for the exact same thing before they delve in.
@_date: 2017-07-17 06:42:26
Your assertiveness comes off as arrogant. 
@_date: 2016-10-08 18:20:29
I'm curious about this too.
@_date: 2017-07-11 21:23:00
I think that's an unfair judgement of my viewpoint.  I got involved with bitcoin because of the promise of world-wide payments for the unbanked and the concept of digital anonymous cash.  In a sense, I was a big blocker before I knew what a block size was.  It was only after numerous attempts to learn on r/btc that has my opinion started to change.  It's not even that I've been turned into a small blocker.  I just trust what I read and enjoy the conversations more on r/bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:43:21
Thanks for the explanation. So without getting into the technical explanation, are you of the opinion that the 2x hard fork is:
1) Risky because its a hard fork 
2) Reduces decentralization 
3) Risky because larger blocks are less secure somehow? 
Is that the general small block stance or am I totally off base?
@_date: 2017-05-03 17:25:41
I'm neither a believer nor a detractor of Craig Wright but just because he didn't prove beyond a doubt that he controls the private keys, doesn't mean he's not Satoshi or at least a part of the original collaboration. In my opinion, CW must have had some connection to the early days of Bitcoin. To completely disregard this idea simply because he didn't prove it is turning a blind eye.  
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:33:38
Interesting but....what does that have to do with Roger Ver's stance on wanting Bitcoin Unlimited to be the scaling solution?  Doesn't he own bitcoin.com's mining pool or do I have that wrong?
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:29:28
I know there are billions being held on exchanges.  I'm not disputing that however the narrative that is played out over and over is DO NOT KEEP YOUR BITCOIN ON AN EXCHANGE. You can't blame people for listening.
@_date: 2017-07-07 17:58:34
It's not that that bothers me.  It's their complete lack of knowledge. I don't understand how they can call it a crypto show when they are such ignorant fools. Add in the buffoonery and commercial breaks that interrupt the guests and it's painful to listen to.  Embarrassing really.
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:43:11
I don't think that can happen. I think if you change your password, withdrawls are locked for 24 hours. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 13:34:50
So does this mean bitcoin cash is dead in the water? Some people on r/btc are convinced that Bitcoin ABC is a  sure thing now. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 01:43:49
I think that's exactly what I'm doing. Although I'm not sure what the CryptoNews is? 
@_date: 2017-07-23 19:14:23
I disagree. The last 2 years has proved that there's more than enough 'stupid' to go around. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:18:44
I've tried to learn some different points of view over there but it's hopeless.  So much negativity and immaturity. Chronic goal post movers.  They just jump on whatever the latest anti-Core trend is.  
@_date: 2017-07-23 21:20:49
To a non-techy, this sounds reasonable. 
@_date: 2017-07-21 20:37:51
Sounds like a good plan.  Considered it myself but luck in the market never seems to be on my side.  I'll let you know if I do sell and that will be a good buy signal for everyone else.
@_date: 2017-07-21 02:24:12
If the "big players" "cashed out" the price would drop by lot more than $100.
@_date: 2017-07-21 16:21:19
There's nothing wrong with taking the safest route when there is still some risk is there?
@_date: 2017-07-01 01:25:00
I've made several honest attempts at discussion over there and no matter what I've tried, it's been received with aggressive, childish resistance. I don't get it. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 02:35:11
Just. Doesn't. Get it. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 18:08:41
It already happens all the time.  In my business we exchange services and products with other vendors without the use of government issued currency all the time.  The advantage bitcoin has is that it could be universally applied to any goods or services.
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:21:01
Not increasing block size is also harming decentralization because high fees starts to centralize bitcoin use to the wealthier users. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 04:34:36
I didn't realize that. It makes sense. But the less time the host spents on buffoonery, the more time his guests have to speak.  
@_date: 2017-07-08 14:30:19
I guess my question is that if all the blocks are empty post segwit, what's the point of hardforking for a blocksize increase?  
  
Edit.  Apologies, I am confusing blocks with the mempool.  I am referring to Charlie's statement about the empty mempool.  My bad.  Still learning.
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:39:56
Please don't turn this sub into r/btc. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 16:13:13
I'm confused.  Does bitcoin.com signaling segwit2x not go against Roger Ver's BU stance? Shouldn't most of the big block community be outraged?  What am I missing?
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:01:09
Like I said, you strike me as the type who doesn't have the stomach for it. I've seen swings much more alarming than this one. Also, it takes  certain type of person to come in on a good day and try to rain on everyone's parade.  You should definitely sell. I hear energy stocks ae doing well.
@_date: 2017-07-10 20:49:42
I can't agree with that.  If that's what it's going to take for people to use bitcoin, bitcoin is doomed.  When I came in , it was paper wallet's all day.  Then Armory offline machines and now Ledger/Trezor.  The concept is getting more user friendly everyday. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 15:04:26
I'm just referencing what Charlie Lee is betting on.
  
I mean that's where this entire debate originates right?  People are upset about long confirmation times and high fees? Without those 2 issues, I don't think there is even a debate going on right now. At least not to the point of fracturing the community.
@_date: 2017-07-31 16:55:49
I don't think it can be priced in unless people have already sold bitcoin for fiat that they are planning on using for Bcash post fork. Also, if there are people planning on acquiring Bcash, it might be a better idea just to wait, receive the duplicate coins when the chain forks, watch the price and then sell their bitcoin for Bcash. Not sure why anyone would do that once they see the price of Bcash heading steadily towards zero as people fire sale them?

@_date: 2017-07-08 04:29:42
All I ask is that you be more knowledgeable. As hosts of a show meant to educate, I find many of your discussions rife with ho-hums and misinformation. For example, whilst making fun of Vitalik Buterin, it was obvious that you know nothing about him. "Does he have a Russian accent?" Seriously? If you had the slightest inclination to dig into the Ethereum project, you'd know that having a Russian sounding a name does not immediately qualify for a Russian accent. He's not Russian. This example is largely meaningless however it does demonstrate your  ignorance in the crypto space. You continually prove that even after several years of producing a crypto show, you really don't understand much beyond the speculative potential of crypto. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:53:41
?  I don't agree that they need to be more technically educated to buy and use bitcoin.  That's precisely what the hardware wallets enable.  Easy use and safe storage.
Also, I trade and I constantly move from the exchanges to hardware and back again. This is precisely where a hardware wallet is superior to paper/brain wallets. I'm not sure I even understand what you are saying there?
@_date: 2017-07-10 19:37:21
It's definitely a barrier to the people that I know.  They aren't bitcoin gurus and don't care to be. They just want to buy some and do some trading but without that security device (required or not) they are holding on to their fiat.
@_date: 2017-07-10 17:22:33
I've tried so many times.  Nothing but vitriol spewed over there. In my opinion, they need more moderation just to keep the discussions civil.  I mean they are slinging personal insults over there for absolutely anything they can grasp on to. It's perplexing to say the least.  A digital replica of the riot mob mentality.
@_date: 2015-10-29 20:29:07
Forget the engine and wheels. If I'm explaining a car to someone who understands carriages, I'd skip straight to the difference in utility. Then once that person understands the reason for a car, I light a can of gasoline on fire and tell them that's where the magic happens.

@_date: 2017-07-05 02:19:07
So no matter what it's going to be an enormous mess? If that is the case, what do we do to steer clear? It's really confusing to the non tech types. Just tell me 'everything is gonna be okay' Okay?

Apologies, it wasn't meant to be an insult. All of your posts are overwhelmingly positive in the r/stratis platform reddit and it comes off as a bit 'pumpish'. I'm totally on your side but like I said, in light of so many ICO's I've been hoping Stratis would grow more organically.

@_date: 2017-07-20 21:21:21
For current holders I agree with you.  I do think there are a large number of bitcoin holders who have been reluctant to spread the word about bitcoin because of high fees and a slow network (me being one of them).  That might change now if segwit does what it's supposed to.  Maybe it will create a higher demand by new users and in turn a much higher price.
@_date: 2017-07-08 02:14:10
I don't find Adam or Andreas ignorant or foolish. Regardless of opinion, I find those guys are both informed and informative. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:44:08
From what I understand, scaling ability is just a bi-product of what segwit was actually created for, malleability? If the scaling benefit had stayed in the background, I bet segwit would have activated a long time ago. Note: this is coming from a simple observer and not a technical expert. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-06-23 19:20:38
Help. Can somebody please set me straight on what I should be supporting?
To summarize:
- I believe Luke is a smart guy. I trust Greg Maxwell and believe pretty much anything Peter Todd says.
- I think r/btc is a cesspool for the most part however I don't think Roger Ver is the devil
- I think fees are reasonable for what I currently do as a holder/believer but I hope there is room for improvement. 
- I think security should be top priority on the network however if bitcoin becomes largely unusable except by the ultra rich and powerful, I'd support some compromise.
- I have used bitcoin for a few purchases but am primarily a long term holder/believer.
I'm so lost. What the hell do I support?  Segwit2x?  USAF? Status Quo?
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:11:47
Thanks for all you do EV.  I was just wondering, what happens to Bitcoin Core if Segwit2x comes to be?  Is that team of devs even mildly in support?
@_date: 2017-07-20 02:05:05
'White' is not a geographical region. Saying Asian is no different than saying European, Middle Eastern, North American or Scandinavian.

I hear what you are saying but between here and r/btc, there's no clear answers.  Everything ends up in a deep fog depending on the participants of any given thread.  It's super hard to educate oneself when there's so much brigading.
@_date: 2017-06-13 16:51:36
He's pumpin pretty hard.  I'm invested but I'd rather see Stratis progress gradually on it's own merit rather than have it exposed too early and get it's reputation thrashed because of pump and dumpers.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:45:28
Thank you.  So for some reason I'm not clear on how Core feels about the UASF or Segwit2x.  Given the choice, would the majority of the Core devs choice one over the other if 'Status Quo' was no longer an option?

Maybe Litecoin should just rebrand as BitcoinLite ;) Big blockers can switch to that network while the current bitcoin network continues as is. Innovation can happen on both chains while not flooding the market with another competing implementation.
