Coinbase is not secure. Not your keys, not your bitcoin. If you plan on amassing more bitcoin, get a ledger. Otherwise, setup a mobile wallet and make sure your seed words are stored on paper, somewhere safe. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:25:20

Goto your transaction records, tap the transaction, hit the three dots on the top right, hit rebroadcast
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:16
Try to close entirely out of the app, and re-open it again. It may have something to do with it being a light wallet, and with bitcoin soaring, they may be experiencing some extra load on their servers. Give it some time,  it will hopefully resolve itself. Next time, make sure you've got your seed words backed up.

This is an ecosystem of currencies. Using litecoin as an every day cash is like using silver compared to gold, or fiat compared to precious metals in general. As long as its got a backing (unlike gov controlled banks), using an alternative currency is an acceptable option.

Can i have your bitcoin, then? They wont work on the moon, im sure you understand and wont mind. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:26:44
Alt coins likely will not catch up in bitcoin value unless they moonshot. Do NOT try to day-trade bitcoin or alt-coins, you will likely lose money. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:21:14
You're wrong there. They charge everyone an outrageous fee, batch ALL of the transactions together, then pay 1 fee for the entirety. I've seen batches of thousands of transactions get sent with a 5$ fee. Every single transaction in the batch paid a set fee to get sent out. They are reluctant to change it, because it makes them money when everyone pays 0.001-0.0008 in "miner fees". 
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:17:08
Get outta here.

He likely either had malware on whatever device he kept his bitcoin, got his email phished, or in some form or another, relinquished control of his private keys. It's not a grand scale thing. In other words, one of his devices was hacked, likely because he practiced shit security.
@_date: 2017-12-02 04:12:46
Gotta increase your security if you want to hold money on a digital device. Not sure where you're hearing about fractions of cents missing from peoples accounts though. Only way for that to happen is for someone to have access to your private keys, and at that point, the attacker is just going to take it all. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:42:28

Mempool size has _literally_ nothing to do with selling bitcoin. Sending and receiving, yes, but the mempool is a cache of transactions waiting on confirmation with the bitcoin network.

If tether were to dump everything, and reveal that they were a scam, the price would drop approx 300$-1000$
So... a normal day for bitcoin. It would likely recover within a week, or less.

Lmfao. I understand bitcoin QUITE fuckin well. 
People will do stupid shit. If you get hacked, and decide to continue in the bitcoin space, you will likely learn better security. Losing your money is the fastest way to learn security. Look up andrea antonopolus. Gotta learn somehow. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:20:55
Liquidity differences, ease of movement differences, and ultimately, the fact that the price is fucking SOARING right now. There's going to be a huge difference based on USD available at an exchange, bitcoin available at an exchange... This is unprecedented, so I wont pretend that I have any certain answer for you. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 06:21:14
Do you not realize that it takes several millions of dollars for this to happen? Roger Ver has done this, multiple times. He's used his "Early Adopter" funds in bitcoin to fund it. He's a goddamned mother fuckin' bad apple. It's bound to happen; A new technology that you invest in makes you rich, and then, you think, you can delay it reaching the rest of the world, just long enough to make YOU rich at the same time. Enter roger ver. Instead of being proud of the investment he made, he's trying to hijack the entire thing. And as an early adopter, he's got the money to do so. Unfortunately for him, he doesn't have the know how. roger ver just got lucky. Really lucky, Just like a literal TON (See: Ton = Two Thousand) of other people who were early adopters of bitcoin. The sad thing is, most early adopters of bitcoin aren't malignant towards bitcoin. They're supportive of it's end-goal. roger thought he could exploit it. And so he has. 
If you've read anything I just said, and you think that r.v. has done ANYTHING that increases the potential of Bitcoin, you're part of HIS plan. Literally, One person's plan, to attempt to hijack the success of bitcoin. You've become a sheep. A r.v. sheep. My god, I fucking pity you.

@_date: 2017-12-24 06:10:39
roger ver funded a spam attack, at the same time that he received insider information from coinbase. ( Actually, he paid off coinbase, so in reality, he didn't receive insider information, he PAID FOR IT TO HAPPEN )

extremely common. I've seen exchanges batch together thousands of wallet withdraws into one transaction, pay a dollar fee, and keep those on-site bitcoin fees for themselves. Easily a several thousand dollar gain every time they batch out withdraws. It's one of the various ways they make money. Without pressure from the community, it wont change.

No, actually. I'm suggestion a hashing function that's possible on most people's computer. Is it gaming freaks? So be it. Our current mining infrastructure is based on only one crypto-fuction : sha256. Bitmain controls the hardware to do such with. That is an issue.

No, you dont understand. Miners are going to flip flop. Let them. We need to be in those realms for bitcoin to succeed. 
Not a niche, not a random sect of computing. We need to be in those fields. Were everyone can chose anything to mine. When we see a diverse field of mine-able coins, we'll see things to start to even out. Allowing it all to be done on one algo specific setup, is fucking our chances. Let anyone with a computing device actually compete in the world market, and we win the crypto-currency war.

You're telling me that using a hashing function that everyday people can use would provide a route for 51% attack?

If all the exchanges announced that they'd lost all of their bitcoin in a raid, I'd feel terrible for the people who lost their bitcoin, while I sit back and enjoy the fact that I've got control of my keys, not an exchange. 
Oh, and as for "a little knowledge of computer and blockchain". I've been a professional programmer for coming up on 17 years. We're seeing an incredible use of technology. Trustless peer to peer distributed ledger technology is by far one of the most important innovations this generation has ever seen. Banks run on similar technology, but instead of an algorithm saying what can and can't be done, we're relying on ethical action, and error-free humans to control our money. 
Nothing you've said has any basis in fact bruh, "Bitcoin is a giant Tulip fad", is the same as me saying bitcoin is the next big thing. Neither of us can know for sure if we're correct, but I sure as hell know that the technology blockchain has enabled is revolutionary. As a programmer, as a development lead, as a serial entrepreneur; Bitcoin/Blockchain has brought technology that WILL change how the world sees trust. That's my arguement. Not that bitcoin will succeed, which I personally believe it will (otherwise I wouldn't be in this sub), but that the technology behind it is VERY revolutionary. Instead of trusting people to do a job, we can trust an algorithm to do the same. 
BTC price spikes aren't predicted on mass adoption. It's supply and demand. It is NOT speculation based. It's "you know what, I want some bitcoin!". And guess what, someone wanting bitcoin isnt alone. So whats the problem? Shits limited, and you can't have mine! That's whats driving the price. The volatility of it IS caused by predicted mass adoption. However mass adoption is coming, and again, sorry, you can't buy my bitcoin :) Find someone else who will sell you theirs.  
@_date: 2017-10-14 10:18:01
The Chinese government attempted to ban bitcoin as a means of exchange. Localbitcoins traffic soared. The fact of the matter, and you can hate it all you'd like, is that bitcoin CANNOT be regulated. 
Drop exchanges, make it illegal. Cool. People will still find ways to trade the currency. The problem for your argument is that very similar to the recent SEC meeting. "That sounds a like a contract, who protects me if I get scammed?" No one. No one does. But who protects you if you pay a merchant 500$ cash and he whips out a 45 and blows your brains out? How about you pay someone with a mask on, someone you have NO idea the identity of. (With cash, mind you). Was that a good decision? Literally every argument that you've made about bitcoin is one of distaste, without logic. You REALLY could answer all of your own questions if you put some thought into it. 
Remember that merchant that blew your brains out over 500$ cash? His cash now. Take out banks, and cash is what bitcoin is now. An agreed upon medium of exchange. 
Oh, and as for block rewards; As miners run away in droves because their mining activities are no longer profitable, many will come in their place. Ya know, when the difficult drops to fuckin hell because no ones mining it. All one person has to do is flip on some GPU's and claim the bounty that is the amassed transaction fees. 
SMFH; I have a genuine question for you; If all of the banks in the world suddenly shutdown. Right now. Would your dollar be worth anything? Your paper, cold hard cash dollar. Bitcoin is a like a Euro bill in the Mid-West US. Fuckers are too far beyond times to have a damn clue what to do with it. It's got worth, and ignorance isn't and excuse to say it doesn't. 
Damn right it would. And if you think anything else, you're delusioned.
