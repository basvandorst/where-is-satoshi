Yes necessarily. Lets do some math.   
Amount of hashing power required to reverse 0 confirmed transaction = 0
Amount of hashing power required to reverse 1 confirmation transaction on a bitcoin chain that releases a block every single second  &gt; 0
Just the fact that you have to have some hashing power in the game makes a 1 confirmed transaction significantly better than 0 confirmed.  Right now I could go to a bitcoin accepting brick store and pull off a double spend 0 confirm if I really wanted to, but if I wanted to pull off a double spend at a store that required 1 confirmation, even if blocks were released every 3 seconds it would still require a significant amount of sophistication and even luck to pull off such scam.  Yes it would be significantly easier than pulling off a 1 confirmation double spend at 10 minutes, but compared to how easy it is to pull off a 0 conf double spend it is still a significant hurdle/risk to overcome

This answer really doesn't make sense.  First of all, 1-confirm has never really been "enough"  Most big companies I know require 3 - 6 confirmations.  
Secondly, no matter how short you make the length between blocks, 1 confirmation will ALWAYS be better than 0 confirmations.  I feel like having that first confirmation twice as quick would make up for the inconvenience of doubling the number of blocks required for a security standard when the actual time variance for everything remains the same

Ok, what big break-throughs have actually been implemented?
@_date: 2017-02-23 11:46:30
Right, that's why I'm interested in who might be developing the trustless solution.
Moving large transfers off the chain is going to do very little for blockchain conjestion, unlike payment channels.  Federated pegs feel like fancy reinvention of the SWIFT system.  Regular people don't use SWIFT often (unless we're trying to get our money into a decent bitcoin exchange ;) )
@_date: 2017-02-05 20:21:39
No, in fact Luke jr, one of the core devs, just submitted a proposal to reduce the blocksize to 300kb and then slowly raise it to 2mb over the course of several years. I'm pretty sure Maxwell isn't open to considering a blocksize hardfork anytime in the near future either
@_date: 2017-02-05 11:24:13
BU just superseded Segwit in terms of hashing support. The people over in the other sub are pretty excited about it. I'm not sure I'd call it brigading but there's definitely some shifting happening with energy levels

You know what else was never a problem with bitcoin before?  Transaction backlogs.  Extreme times call for extreme measures

I sincerely hope you're right about Lightning Networks.
I do have to I disagree with you're dismissal of the myspace example just because it was a company. A network is a network, whether it be social or economic.  The fact that many businesses are in fact monopolies kind of shoots your argument in the foot.

@_date: 2017-02-21 21:23:57
having a monopoly doesn't mean you are the best. Comcast has a monopoly but there are many far better internet providers.  Microsoft had a monopoly, and maybe still does, but linux is a better operating system.  Still Comcast and Microsoft are at risk of losing their monopolies (Google fiber and Ubuntu might do it).
If an altcoin provides better service than bitcoin, it is ridiculously easy for people to switch over.  Coinbase and most other exchanges and already support ethereum.  There are not many shops that support bitcoin in the first place.  Where exactly do you spend bitcoin that you cant spend ethereum?  It doesn't even matter because you can use shapeshit to seamlessly switch between them.
Don't be cocky.  Bitcoin must continue to evolve if it wants to survive

Look man, I'm as big a bitcoin fan as anyone. 90% of my holdings are bitcoin.  But you're seriously drinking coolaid if you think somehow bitcoin is money and ethereum isn't.  Yes ethereum is designed to be used in a broader sense than just money, but its ability to transfer wealth from one person to another is just as good (if not better given bitcoin's currently high fees and long wait times) as bitcoin's.
Saying bitcoin is better money than ethereum because it has a more limited scope is like saying a calculator is better than a smart phone for crunching numbers: Nope they both crunch numbers perfectly fine, one just does a lot more other shit too
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:20:09
Also why give up on 2p2 sidechains?  Are they really so difficult?  It seems like the most important development bitcoin could implement right now
@_date: 2017-02-21 07:42:05
exactly!!  And why would people use bitcoin when it costs so much more to transact?  Or if they have to be afraid of their transaction taking days to get through?
Remember Myspace had all the network effect in the world before facebook came along and did social networking even better
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:41:01


That is just so arrogant. Look at the history of the crypto-space: Year by year bitcoin losing market value compared to crypto as a whole.  We are bleeding value because we can't innovate fast enough.
The price is high now, yes, great!  But that's all 100% network effect, not innovation.  Crypto-currency is here to stay, thankfully, but is there a difference between using bitcoin and litecoin?  Not really.  How hard is it for an individual to switch? Easy.  Will a lot of people switch to litecoin? No not right now.  Not over $.30 and a couple extra hours.  
But would they switch in 3 months when transactions cost $2 and take a few days?  I would.  Especially if that other crypto has extra privacy benefits or programmable features.
We're basically treating alt-coins like financial gurus used to treat bitcoin when it first came out.  And just like them, we will regret it
@_date: 2017-02-05 11:28:11
I don't know, I think if I were to look to the economic community, my first glance would go to Coinbase; and from what I remember they aren't too friendly with core right now. Coinbase+miners would represent a pretty large portion of the economic community
@_date: 2017-02-19 10:59:51
Ethereum has a market cap of over a billion dollars.  It's the second most valuable crypto in the world. That sounds like real money to me.
I think Ethereum survived their fork so well because of the solid developer community.  That's really the only worry I have about bitcoin.  If the devs get burnt out because no new developments can be implemented because of all the politics and the difficulty in achieving consensus, they will migrate to less toxic projects.
If bitcoin forks, both sides can be happy and keep working on their vision of what bitcoin should be.  Let the market decide which vision is better
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:23:43


It sounds like you understand the concept, and yet we are coming to different conclusions.  How are you not getting this?
Right now, running an attack on bitcoin that raises the fees to $.10 would cost you (1mb worth of $.10 transactions) - (however many legitimate transactions are willing to pay $.10)
However to run the same attack on a 2mb chain, you would have to fill twice as much space (2mb with $.10 transactions) -(however many legitimate transactions are willing to pay $.10).
 Assuming that the number of legitimate transactions stays the same, the cost for the attack for twice as much space will be roughly (though not exactly) twice as much.
If you just mean it wont cost as much to fill 2mb because you can get transactions into a block for less money then you are stupid because that is not what we are talking about.  Nobody cares if you   spam $.00001 transactions because those don't inhibit legitimate transactions with a meaningful fee.
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:37:20
It tells you that fees are 3x higher than the default on most wallets, which means we are going to be seeing a lot more upset newbs on this thread complaining about stuck transactions

Satoshi designed bitcoin as a p2p electronic cash system, not a clearance protocol.  Besides that, who cares what you think its designed for, there's absolutely no reason not to raise the blocksize because 2mb isn't going to centralize anything and everybody knows this
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:08:07
easy mate, I don't think he was disparaging big block proponents, just noting that there are implications
@_date: 2017-02-23 12:00:12
Somebody has to make the decision regarding what the network can handle/what the users need.
The core devs have shown that they are incapable of making this decision.  The increasing transaction backlogs we are seeing are just ridiculous.
Miners have an enormous stake in the success of bitcoin and are incentivized to do what is in the best interest of the price of bitcoin.
These "cartals" you are worried about are the equivalent of boogy-men.  Miner centralization is already a huge problem regardless of the blocksize.
BU is no more dangerous than having an unending backlog of transactions
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:28:10
I think its amusing that of all the developers involved in the bitcoin project, Gavin appears to you the weak moral link.

No, transactions *fees* are required to sustain bitcoins security model.
I really don't want to get into an argument about how bad it is having high-fee transactions stuck in limbo for 12+ hours when we have competition that can achieve the same function in minutes for a fraction of the fee because I know we've had it before and I don't see it going anywhere productive

I'm claiming that raising the limit to 2mb will have no noticeable effect on miner centralization.  On the contrary, increasing the userbase will increase the value of the currency and incentivise more miners.  Furthermore, raising the blocksize above 8mb would place chinese miners at a distinct disadvantage because of the Chinese firewall creating a massive opportunity for genuine decentralization in the mining world
@_date: 2016-01-31 04:29:38

No, classifying hardforks as altcoins was 100% completely the problem and is what enraged so many users to start spamming the sub with XT posts.  It was a reaction, not a causation.

This is a bullshit complaint.  gavin approves of those other implementations just as much as the rest of us.  He didn't mention them because they aren't controversial and don't need defending within the community.

I know right?  Who cares whether or not bitcoin is successful?
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:59:36
Um.. yes it will.  If you fill up 1mb with $0.10 transactions then people have to pay $.11+ to get a transaction in the block.  But if you pay the same amount to fill up 2mb you'll only be paying $.05 which means $.06 will get a transaction through.  So in order to do an attack that creates the same paywall on 2mb blocks that you could on 1mb blocks you will have to pay twice as much.
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:09:54
Bitcoin is my money. It belongs to everyone who uses it.  It's truly "By the people, for the people"

@_date: 2017-02-17 02:28:17
We already have that issue with alt-coins, and so far they've only drained a marginal amount of value from the bitcoin space; overall you could argue they've added value as a whole to the cryptocurrency space.  
There's no reason to think a hardfork wouldn't have the same effect. obviously a fork that adds no value will be ignored, like most shitcoins are.  But occasionally there will be a legitimate reason for the fork (say allowing for more than 2 transactions/second).  In this case value is added to the bitcoin protocol, even if some specific forks suffer as a result of the competition
@_date: 2016-01-27 18:19:10
Your responses in this thread so far really make you sound like an uncompromising prick that will find or contrive any excuse not to play nice with others.

Its disappointing to see this kind of child-like behavior in a community leader
@_date: 2016-01-01 01:48:47
I know exactly why we use such a long confirmation time, its the same reason we use such a small 1mb transaction limit:  Because that's just how it was when most of us got involved with the protocol and now there are so many stubborn sticks clogging up the gears that trying to change it just wouldn't be worth the political energy required to get everyone on board.  Even Gavin Andresen agrees that bitcoin would benefit from more frequent blocks.

refusing to be coerced by megalomaniacs?  That's one way to frame it.  Refusing to listen to/compromise with bitcoin's participants is another way. Maybe megalomaniacs are still the issue though..
 Regardless. I think if segwit was truly the answer you believe it to be then we wouldn't be in the situation we are presently in, and I think if core had any capacity for leadership they would have seen that segwit would not be accepted as the compromise the other side was looking for.
In anycase, we can agree that it is a sad state of affairs. 
@_date: 2016-01-26 14:18:51
I really don't understand why anyone would be opposed to growth.


Its not just you.  There is not a single person in the debate who things increasing the blocksize is the end all to scaling bitcoin.  It's a quick-fix for everyone until we have a more elegant solution
@_date: 2016-01-26 14:25:02
That really doesn't sound like a problem at all.  Why would anyone go through all that trouble mining a bitcoin block just to add a few minutes of verification?  How much time would increasing to blockchain size to 10mb add? And how hard would it be for other miners to simply decide to orphan a complex block like that?
@_date: 2016-01-28 05:04:55
It should have been a technical decision, but its become much much more than that for a long while now.  I haven't read anything that makes me believe they even have a differing opinion.  The 2-4-8 proposal was made by Adam himself, who was one of the staunchest small-block proponents.  Also, nobody is saying core is to blame for the censorship of the subredit, only that making a public statement against censorship would go a long way to building up trust with the community.

If you're going to add more points to teamwater, then team shelter deserves a few counterpoints of its own.
1.) Teamshelter believes that the storm will kill everbody and a hastily built shelter, while potentially dangerous, will only hurt one or two people and wont bring the whole community to its knees.
2.)Teamshelter doesn't believe the shelter provided by the well is enough to actually shelter everyone.  Maybe it will provide 1.75x the amount of shelter they presently have, but the forecast calls for lots of big storms and 3.5x the shelter could be easily accomplished and would make us feel much much safer.
I don't really want to get into a weird indirect debate with you I'm just saying Eric did a pretty decent job of summarizing the attitudes of both sides.  He's obviously not going to satisfy everyone on both sides with an accurate representation of their technical positions.
@_date: 2016-01-30 20:49:23

That's a bit optimistic (pessimistic?) considering the transactions doubled just this year alone.  Plus what about all the growth we miss out on from companies opting not to use the bitcoin blockchain due to congestion concerns?
I don't understand why anyone would prefer to operate at just under max capacity instead of giving ourselves a little breathing room to grow until more permanent solutions are found
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:38:59
What exactly is wrong with Segwit + 2mb?  In all your meandering you never ever address the one issue we care about.  You're just repeating the same argument over and over.  You say you're afraid of the dangers of a "controversial hardfork"  yet literally the only person making the fork controversial is yourself.  Hardforks are possible and feasible with a little bit of planning.  a 75% increase is simply not enough.  The transaction volume is doubling every year now.
@_date: 2016-01-26 12:55:44
I don't understand how 1 and 2 are even opposing camps.  There is nobody that doesn't think we should not work on a permanent solution, and how exactly does 2 prevent 1 in anyway?  You can raise the blocksize immediately and still do research for a permanent solution for the future.
If you believe that


then why take the economic risk of full blocks with longer confirmation times and higher fees?
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:16:07
If core had an inkling of leadership ability and a healthy notion of diplomacy we might have had a successful hardfork and segwit right now
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:03:11
That makes 0 sense considering miners have invested millions of dollars into hardware that can only mine bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:36:53
I completely agree that a blocksize increase is a temporary fix, I'm looking forward to all the layer two tech that we've been promised especially sidechains and lightning.  But having room to grow until those solutions are ready is important to stay the leading crypto on the market.
Segwit might give us a few months, max, and then we have no more options for on chain scaling.  An 8mb hardfork with the segwit malleability fix would give us at least a year, and more importantly it would re-unite the community and let us focus on the important stuff
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:42:41
The failure is pretty clearly those who've let utterly unsubstantiated fears of "centralization" paralyze the protocol into the brink of a fee event. 2mb isn't going to centralize anything and we could put off the headache of rising fees long enough to implement something like lightning.
(and don't give me any BS about 'segwit' being the answer.  By the time it finally gets up and running the .5mb extra it gives us will already be full again; or at least it would be if this capacity problem doesn't completely stunt bitcoin's growth)
@_date: 2017-02-22 22:42:10
Agreed. The entire blocksize debate feels unnecessary and petty
@_date: 2016-01-28 05:11:59
How about letting people do their own due diligence instead of making everyone's decisions for them?  What do you want a nanny government to tell you what toilet paper to use?  How is anyone supposed to know its more of a scam than any other altcoin on the market? 
@_date: 2016-01-30 21:56:40
That doesn't really help in the case of a volume increase crisis.  The fact is, the core devs are playing recklessly close to these limits.  If Latin America all of a sudden decides bitcoin is the bomb, we're fucked because we can't handle a bunch of new people at once.
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:41:49
Which is exactly why people have been trying to get this hardfork rolling for over a year now.  Gavin's latest proposal has the 2mb increase taking place Jan 1st 2018, the longer we wait to get this on the agenda, the more we're shooting ourselves in the foot
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:48:26
Sure, but if 90% of miners are in China, then they share the same bandwidth issues and its not really an issue is it?  If it becomes an issue, then we can consider it freemarket forces pressuring miners towards countries without internet problems.  I can't be the only one that is uncomfortable with 90% of bitcoin's hashing power being located in one of the world's least-free countries, can I?
It's funny because small block proponents used to have "decentralization" as their standard, but now its a few mining conglomerates who seem to be keeping the blocksize small
@_date: 2016-01-28 05:29:35

I just read that BIP101 actually already had a solution in place.  Plus segwit fixes this completely.
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:57:53
So you don't consider Mike Hearn or Gavin or Jeff Garzick qualified opinions?  Because they seem to be in favor of raising the blocksize limit relatively immediately in order to alleviate blockchain congestion and give the developers time to create a more elegant solution.
How can you say 5 minutes isn't better than 10 minutes?  That's a full 5 minutes where you have degree of confidence that, although not as strong as a 10 minutes confirmation, is infinitely better than 0 confirmations.

No, according to the mods of this subreddit, Coinbase does not use bitcoin at all.  Any mention of them is off topic and subject to removal (now I'm actually being serious, no sarcasm)

Probably also partly because it's pretty easily fixed?  Sounds like Gavin had a fix for it back in BiP 101.

He's basically trying to unite this community and offering ideas that require little to no effort or compromise on the behalf of core that would go a long long way to healing the rift that has risen here
@_date: 2016-01-16 00:55:23
People are waking up to a very serious issue in the decision making process of development.    It might take a while, but once we get a good process figured out for dealing with differences in developer opinion we should be back on track pretty quick. 
The best thing we can do as a community is to stay informed

Are you kidding me?  I've been working with bitcoin since 2011. I understand the argument.  I am perfectly capable of comparing the risk of a "fee event" with the risk of a hard fork.  (spoiler alert: risk of full blocks is far more dangerous to the development of bitcoin than the risk of a hardfork.)

maybe they listened, I can't attest to that, but they most certainly did not compromise.  In order to compromise, a concession has to be made.  Please point me to a concession on the part of core.

I don't know, it could be that he believes that bigger blocks allowing more transactions will allow for more use cases and bring in more mining revenue and he sees BU as the most viable route to achieving that goal.  He may be misguided, but I think that's more plausible than the evil overlord theory.

If you look at the value of bitcoin vs the total value of all cryptocurrency over time, you will notice that the value of other crypto is increasing faster than the value of bitcoin.  Bitcoin is definitely riding the wave of network effect, but network effects have their limits.  You can close your eyes and ears and scream "honey badger" but natural selection is going to take its course.  As a community we should be striving to fix problems, not normalize them.

Then why not just make everyone happy and add a hardfork to the roadmap?  You are literally asking the guy who has compromised from 20mb to 8mb to finally 2mb to simply change his mind and give up his beliefs for the better of bitcoin when the other side refuses to budge even 1 iota 
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:48:06
What does that have to do with anything?  Every single one of the core devs works for somebody.  At least with gavin its a not-for-profit highly respected university
@_date: 2016-01-26 12:27:30
The 1 month line is a straw man, the blocksize debate has been happening for over a year, besides the hardfork requires 75%+ of the mining community to switch before the '1 month' even goes into effect.  That's more than enough time for testing.
Also what do you have against lower confirmation times?  All things being equal, a lower confirmation time is generally preferable.  You don't have to be pushing an altcoin to recognize that.
Your attitude of considering people with different views as being people that "shouldn't be listened to" is precisely what is tearing this community apart.  
@_date: 2016-01-30 18:03:41
We all know you're the guy keeping the proposal off the roadmap, why don't you explain to the community why exactly you don't think its a good proposal and then engage adam in a technical debate and come up with a solution that everyone can be happy with?

@_date: 2017-03-20 07:28:43
Miners can already limit the blocksize if they want, they just can't raise it.  
You can still install the malleability fix that is segwit to allow for layer 2 tech and also have a hard fork block size increase.
@_date: 2016-01-31 04:42:15
Conservative is only good until its too much.  The financial system that bitcoin is displacing is also very conservative, but eventually enough is enough.  I'm not sure where these ideas about hard forks being catastrophic come from, but we've done hard forks before and we seem to being coming along just fine.
the quote is from one of his replies in this thread:   
I'll see if I can link it.
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:31:57
The miners can always limit their blocks to whatever they are comfortable with.  There's no reason to impose an arbitrary hard limit from the protocol level.
Personally though, the amount of power a few companies in China wield over bitcoin development is frightening.  It would be interesting if the increasing the blocksize lead to a shift of hashing power away from China
@_date: 2016-01-30 19:28:12


The governing model of bitcoin has changed several times.  First it was "satoshi says"  Then satoshi gave Gavin the final voice.  Then Gavin stepped down and gave that position to Wladamir who decided he really didn't want it and now we're stuck in this position where the community is splitting
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:52:43


If this is a joke, please excuse the follow outburst of disbelief.  I'm honestly having a hard time discerning sarcasm in this thread these days.
But are you insane?  honestly, how could you think that analogy applies in any possible form?  Bitcoin is not a university.  This is a currency. 
Here's a better analogy:  Imagine the United States starts charging people a tax to use its USD.  Nothing huge, just $.10 per transaction.  What do you think the rest of the world is going to do?  You honestly think it's going to stay the world reserve currency??  Hell no.  The world will switch to Euros or Yens or Pounds faster than Uncle Sam can say "Capitalism Bitches!" 
 Bitcoin has fierce competition.  There are hundreds of cryptos that work just as well as bitcoin, but lack 1 simple advantage: the Network effect.  All it takes is for bitcoin to make 1 simple mistake, like pricing out newbs who have a hard time picking a network fee, and that 1 advantage that keeps us  will crumble before our eyes.
If you want elitism, go start "Hipster Coin" or whatever.  Bitcoin is about being the best quality money

There are enough people with ample understanding of the code on both sides of the debate for a comment like yours to be dismissed as elitist smack talk.
People don't trust the core team because they have fucked up and divided this community with their massive egos.  If they had decided to work with Gavin back when he first proposed a hardfork nearly a year ago, this issue would be months behind us and we could be 100% united in finding a long-term scaling solution
@_date: 2016-01-30 18:15:17
Why do you believe this?  Maxwell has stated that he absolutely does not support a hardfork unless the entire system is on the brink of collapse 
@_date: 2016-01-30 20:54:17


No I haven't been downvoting you, only commenting.
But waiting till a major problem comes up (like a massive transaction volume increase) would be a huge mistake considering how dangerous hard forks are and how careful we need to be when doing them.  All the current plans for a hardfork won't even be implemented till Jan 2018.  That's 2 years away.  If we wait to even get started there is no way we will be able to fix everything in time if we experience a crisis.
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:05:47
I prefer to think of people as rational actors behaving in their own best interest rather than egomaniacs plotting world domination, but to each his own I guess
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:16:09
So I had a longer more detailed reply but it got eaten and I'm not sure how much either of us will gain from more discussion but I'll just summarize with this:
so again we have big blockers asking for an immediate fork to relieve the transaction volume, and then core refusing them, and taking 2 years to offer segwit, which they knew would be rejected as a blocksize increase because its clumsy as a softfork and the only reason it was written as a softfork instead of a hardfork was so that we wouldn't need a hardfork.  Segwit was never a compromise, it was merely the first offer put forward by core.
  So now we're at an impasse between segwit and BU. Neither side is budging. The obvious compromise would be hardfork+segwit but core won't even consider it, so the only option big blockers have is to fork.  BU is the fork with the most momentum at the moment so that's that
All that hard work by the core devs wasted because they don't know how to do diplomacy
@_date: 2016-01-30 19:55:07
Maxwell said in one of his last posts yesterday "I wouldn't personally support a hard fork unless I thought the alternative was a failure of the system"
He really does not want a hardfork, ever.  That has a lot of people concerned and he's been asked about it many many times but he just refuses to give a straight answer.  
All Eric is asking is that core puts a hardfork in the roadmap.  That doesn't seem unreasonable to me, especially if, was you seem to believe, the "have acknowledged that we will have to hard fork.. at some point"
@_date: 2016-01-30 18:28:14
Then what does that have to do with my OP?
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:37:37

Also, calling me dishonest because I hold a different view than you doesn't really seem fair.  I've been a part of bitcoin since 2011.

@_date: 2017-03-19 16:58:45
the mistake was not doing a simple 8mb hardfork years ago, now there's going to be fork not just on the blockchain, but within the community too.  But go ahead and keep telling yourself that segwit was a compromise and core is being unreasonably usurped despite their amazing leadership
@_date: 2016-01-30 18:23:04
You kind of broke the analogy, since nobody is talking about ethics or who deserves rights.  We're talking about who governs and makes decisions for this protocol.  If core had a kind of constitution that we could hold them accountable to then you'd have a stronger case, but as things stand they are just dictators using "consensus" to validate their decisions. I don't think its any wonder that the community is fragmenting in hopes of finding more appropriate governing 
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:34:50
Except segwit as a softfork is ugly and makes future blocksize increases unruly.  Core should propose a hardfork with segwit and an 8mb block increase and make everybody happy
@_date: 2017-03-22 04:41:15
You're trying to tell me that the largest stake holders in bitcoin have some sort of incentive to see bitcoin fail?  That's some impressive mental gymnastics 
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:03:21
This kind of one-sided dismissal of the legitimacy of the case of the other side is why we're in our current predicament.  It makes it really hard to see how a fork could possibly be avoided
@_date: 2017-03-21 07:30:07
Bitcoin has been upgraded with hardforks before and it went fine
@_date: 2016-01-29 09:32:46
The only reason he's trying to avoid breaking compatibility is to make the rest of the core devs happier since they love to bitch and moan about little stuff like that.
If the majority of users weren't in favor of blocksize increase, then nobody would give a shit about competing hardforks since nobody would bother with them.  They fact that Theymos has to censor all discussion of competing hardforks is evidence "to protect bitcoin" is enough that the majority favors them.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:20:48
8mb is perfectly safe and should have happened years ago.  What was dangerous was artificially limiting the blocksize too low, creating an inflating fee market and causing a rift in the community that is tearing us in two.  I am not a huge proponent of BU on its technical merit, but the blame for its existence lies squarely on core and their inability to compromise
@_date: 2016-03-01 08:56:57
Newbs don't care/understand what that means.  They are going to pay the default fee regardless of the size
@_date: 2016-01-30 21:09:14
I agree that this is going to be a headache, but it seems to only be a problem for exchanges or services that run an online wallet.  If they have time to prepare, I don't think it would be all that hard to run a 'minoritycoin withdraw' program, the same way than an exchange would when they cease to support a particular altcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:27:41
more like many miners are tired of core refusing to implement a workable compromise on the blocksize issue

It's simply not enough.  Transaction volume doubled just this last year. Blocks are 85% full.  We are already having days where transactions take hours to get through.  Giving us an extra 75% of space will hold us over for a few months, sure.  But its not going to offer us any relief for several months and even by the time it does, we're going to need another solution.  Raising the limit just gives us some breathing room so we're not all feeling the squeeze so badly.
@_date: 2016-01-31 04:47:03
I don't really know how to respond to this.  Obviously it will never happen because you'd have to be crazy to want to raise the cap and make your bitcoin worth less money.  However you don't have to be crazy to want more people to be able to use bitcoin, so I guess we'll see what happens when the majority decides to raise the blocksize limit.
@_date: 2016-01-31 04:32:50
multiple iterations allow for the market to direct the decision making process.  There's also voting.
@_date: 2016-01-30 20:30:49


but there's really not. It's mentioned as some kind of emergency tool that could be used if the road map doesn't quite pan out.  It says,  to paraphrase, 'maybe, if all the other stuff we're working on doesn't permanently fix the problem in time then we'll have to do some kind of scaled down increase or something'
I personally can't really blame anyone for having trust and control issues when you so blithely dismiss their argument as being without merit.  Maybe because you're not an economist it doesn't concern you that fees have gone up 500%, blocks are 85% full on average after transaction volume has just doubled within a year and there are some days where transactions are backlogged for hours.  Maybe you can't envision a scenario where transaction volume increases dramatically in a short time period, greatly exacerbating these symptoms and causing a lot of headaches for a lot of new people, ruining their first impression of bitcoin and giving rise to the success of other crypto-currencies with higher through-puts.
But no, this is preposterous to even consider.  Instead, lets focus on how scary and dangerous a hard fork is.
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:29:58
Mike Hearn coded all of BitcoinJ and was involved with bitcoin before Either maxwell or back got involved.  From nowhere? He left Google to work on bitcoin. Back isn't even a core developer.
Maxwell and Back founded a company that accepted $21 in start-up funding and stands to make a profit off facilitating off-chain transactions which is conveniently in line with maxwell's uncompromising adherence to maintaining small blocks.  Is it really that big of a stretch to imagine that they might just be letting a profit incentive dictate their governance of bitcoin?  I mean who would blame them?
Any I don't see what any of this has to do with the debate at hand.   Your whole thing seems to be Appeal to Authority and Ad Hominin which isn't really a game I like to play so I don't think we'll get anywhere.
Btw, 5 minutes is not an eternity, its 5 minutes. Which just happens to be half of 10 minutes. No its not seconds, but its an improvement and we could effectively double the amount of transactions per second with that. The fact that its not some kind of perfect wonder solution is really relevant because the millisecond transaction solution doesn't exist right now 
@_date: 2016-01-31 04:35:28


I think you've got that backwards.  Right now there are a few developers who are forcing everyone to maintain 1mb blocks.  If a fork occurs it means 1.) 75%+ people supported a change. and 2.) That bitcoin has succeeded in overcoming the small portion of entities trying to force small blocks on everyone else.
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:24:05
Actually Gavin Andresen and Mike Hearn said so, the same people who worked on bitcoin back when this community was a pleasure to be a part of 
@_date: 2017-03-21 07:30:51
No wonder indeed
@_date: 2016-01-26 16:33:09
Yes I have.  There's really not an issue as long as everyone upgrades.  If we had started BIP 101 back when it was first proposed, the community would have had more than 6 months to ready itself for the fork by now.  And then this entire skism in the community would be in the past and our community would be whole.  Instead we have a fragmented mess, and all because some people were scared of a hardfork.
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:04:48
I can expect core to provide a little leadership and solve problems.   I don't see any BIPS that offer a hardfork segwit with an 8 mb blocksize increase.
 All they've done is campaign to successfully prevent a blocksize increase from happening and driven the community into our present crisis
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:07:37
It was actually something about how any good answer would be deleted.
Maybe the mods are having a laugh?
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:22:36
uhh.. I was present for the entire debate, here's how it went:
Gavin: We need 20mb increase
Small blockers: No
Gavin and Mike: Ok, fine just 8mb
Small blockers: No
Classic: 2mb? Please?
Small blockers: No, but here's an awkward softfork that fixes some other issues and almost doubles the blocksize.. kinda, it makes all future blocksize increases super clunky, but its a softfork which makes it awesome.
Big blockers: ... naw segwit looks cool, but we really think it would be better implemented as hardfork and we're ready for a dev team that actually works with its community
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:44:54
yea, waiting 2+ years to implement a very simple blocksize increase despite emphatic community support was incredibly reckless, as we can now witness 
@_date: 2016-03-01 07:32:42
the cap is an instance of artificial scarcity
@_date: 2016-01-29 09:54:53
What the hell is political money?  Is there a money in the world where the majority of the people get to decide how it works?  That's a really interesting idea.
@_date: 2017-03-21 08:09:25
The only reason anybody would oppose segwit is because it is awkwardly done as a softfork.  Employing segwit as a hardfork, especially alongside a blocksize increase would be accepted by everyone except those who are afraid of hardforks and don't want one for any reason
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:06:41
Wait second, hang on.  I don't have enough tinfoil to keep this conversation flowing..
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:58:35
It's funny you talk about risky hard forks and yet core's refusal to take such "risks" has lead us to present events, which in my mind are a hell of a lot more calamitous than losing a few nodes. We're on the brink of a complete miner upheaval and decent chunk of the community is cheering it on.
Small blockers decry centralization and yet our entire economy is governed by a handful of exchanges, miners, and devs.  Node count is really the least of our concerns
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:08:59
whatever "risks" may or may not exist increasing the blocksize, (never been proven) they pale in comparison to the shit storm we are headed for right now.  Seriously how can you argue that its safer to HF the PoW rather than the blocksize?
but no, you're right.  "This is fine"  everything is going according to core's plan, right?
@_date: 2016-01-27 18:24:23
You're ignoring the fact that Class also intends to include Segwit, so at the end of the day, Class will have 3.5mb of capacity wheras core will only have 1.75mb.   If bitcoin transaction volume doubles this year like it did last year, then classic will be still be under capacity wheras core will be over.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:43:58
A PoW HF is ok, but increasing the blocksize is completely out of the question..
How did our community become so broken?
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:29:56
As participants in the bitcoin ecosystem, they have just as legitimate a position as you or any core developer. Dismissing people because you disagree with them does not make you right
@_date: 2017-03-21 08:19:59
I can't agree more.  What is it about core that makes them so averse to compromise?
@_date: 2016-01-31 05:21:06
First off, I have boundless respect for you and the core developers who have created this bitcoin that I love so much. I would be ashamed if my criticism obscured my gratitude for all the work that has gone into this project.


Easy: relief from this stupid divisive debate that has so severely fractured this community.  A step towards healing and unity and growing trust between developers and the users.  Plus the bonus of having more time to work on all that cool stuff you guys are doing.
You call the hard-fork 'risky' and 'rushed', but the fact of the matter is, if we had started implementing this fork back when it was first proposed then by now we'd have had 6 months to safely implement it.  We could have this entire issue behind us.  But now look where we are.  Developers are publicly giving up on bitcoin. Different iterations of bitcoin are threatening to fork not only the protocol, but the entire community. The price is suffering. I have friends that are asking me about what's going on with bitcoin and I have no idea what to tell them.  I've been through every single popped bubble that bitcoin has experienced since the beginning of 2011 and nothing has every shaken my confidence in the future of bitcoin like the way the developers have governed this controversy.  I absolutely love you guys for everything you've done, but it kills me to helplessly watch as the community ruptures itself over something as menial as a blocksize increase
@_date: 2016-01-30 17:59:36
Please, I am begging you.  Give me one example of Gavin using inflammatory rhetoric.

Attitudes like this are part of what is tearing apart this community
@_date: 2016-01-30 21:25:02


Seems to me a hardfork would prove bitcoin's censorship resistance, since the majority would be able to overturn the decisions of the elite few with merge permissions on core.  I don't see where people being able to decide the direction their currency takes is a failure in censorship resistance.  
@_date: 2016-01-30 18:13:40
And the only reason they haven't gained consensus is because maxwell refuses to get on board and his company pays the salary of several other core developers 
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:32:51
Ah, ok you're right. I lost sight of the context, my bad.
@_date: 2016-01-30 19:39:47
The fees are already rising they are up 500% from a few years ago. Transaction volume doubled this year and blocks are 85% full on average.  We've already had several days where backlogs lasted for hours.  Several financial companies have referenced bitcoin's blockchain congestion and poor scaling outlook as reasons for using a blockchain other than bitcoin to run their platform on.  Maybe you don't believe there is any emergency, but I think I can understand why people are getting nervous.
@_date: 2016-01-30 21:38:05


None of the people we vote for have any say over the USD.  Nobody votes for the members of federal reserve.  And even if they did, the system you are refering to is a republic, which utilizes representatives to make decisions, not a democracy where individuals vote on every rule.
Bitcoin is very much a democracy. If a super majority decided they want to raise the 21million cap, then guess what?  It will be raised.  Of course nobody's going to want that so its not going to happen but still you don't seem to understand how the system works.
@_date: 2016-01-27 17:07:11
That doesn't really make sense, I think you're really stretching your reservations here. 
He says he wants segwit, most sane people agree that segwit is a good thing, especially for implementing larger blocks. I don't see any reason why he wouldn't be able to implement segwit the way he wants it.  
But you're right, we shall see what happens when Classic finally comes out

You are seriously part of the problem with this community.  Gavin has done nothing but try his best since the beginning
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:41:11
You're still stuck on your 1 month straw man.  The blocksize debate has been going on for more than a year.  People are generally pretty aware that decisions are being made right now  
Also, Oracle and Redhat are not experiments, they are paid-for financial services.  Bitcoin is not even technically out of beta, any company that is running bitcoin software in any financial "enterprise" capacity had pretty damn well understand the necessity of having their finger on the pulse of the community
@_date: 2016-01-28 04:56:02
Um, no it won't
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:32:10
It's not a technical decision because even with segwit, the blockchain will be completely full by the end of 2017 given then current rate of increase in transaction volume.  Lightning network isn't even in alpha, we have no idea how long its going to take to come out.   The hardfork increase has been in debate for over a year now. Literally the only reason that it hasn't happened by now is that a couple of the core developers refuse to compromise even a smidgen.  It stopped being a technical debate as soon as the blockchain increase side compromised to 2mb which is universally agreed upon to not hurt anything in anyway   
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:24:27
I really don't understand the general aversion to hardforks.  They've happened before and something as simple as increasing the blocksize really couldn't create that much of an issue.  You just give the community plenty of time to adopt and put in stipulations like "This hardfork doesn't take effect until XX% of miners/nodes have switched over"
If we had implemented Bip 101 waay back when it was first introduced, the community would have had more than 6 months to propagate the memo and by now this entire divisive issue would be in the past.  The community could be whole with all the devs working together on long-term scaling issues in harmony.  
Compared to the fall-out created by the core devs resisting the community's request for a quick-fix, I think hardforks are a relatively safe bet.  What's the worst that could happen?  A couple people who fail to pay attention to the community for 6+ months get their transactions reversed and lose money?  That sucks, but its an isolated, easily fixed issue and the community stays intact.

Nice try, i guess, there's nothing in your link that shows anybody being concerned about a reasonable blocksize increase.  Even Satoshi believed that bitcoin could/would raise the size of transaction blocks when they started to fill up.  You're the one spreading misinformation and trying to manipulate people with half-reasoned arguments and general disdain.

He's saying there's no reason to throw away money based on its intelligence if we don't have to.  That's like saying "most grandmas are too dumb to use bitcoin, rather than making bitcoin easier to use, just dismiss them as people we don't really want using bitcoin anyway.

by those who want to control it, you mean its users who don't want to pay $2 per transaction and the constituents who are most likely to benefit from its success?  I think we should want to compromise because that is what successful communities do if they don't want to fork.  I would rather compromise and be a successful currency than fork and have who knows what happen
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:59:16

@_date: 2016-01-01 01:10:08
I'm not sure you really understand how the PoW system works.  Where are you getting these % confidence numbers?  You just make them up?  Today I feel 83% confident that this transaction will not be reversed?
If you look at the stats, even 0 confirmed transactions have more than 99% chance of not being reversed.  I got that number by looking at the number of transactions that occurred and then comparing them to the number of 0 conf double spends that are attempted.  So that means you can be even more than 99% sure your transaction won't be reversed if you wait for a 3 second confirmation.
What you really don't seem to grasp is that between the gap of 0 conf and 10 min 1 conf, there is a lot of room for confidence to build.  In order to have enough hashing power to reliably mine even 1 block of bitcoin on a 1 minute block system, you'd have to have hundreds of thousands of dollars (if not millions, now) invested in mining equipment.  That's a pretty big investment to make and put at risk just to be able to scam my local bitcoin accepting restaurant out of a free meal.  Now Compare that to 0 conf double spends, which require no investment at all and are made all the more easy to get away with the longer a block takes to find.

Maxwell disagrees. Read is post and his replies when people ask about adding a 2mb hardfork. He says "I wouldn't personally support a hard fork unless I thought the alternative was a failure of the system"  He literally never wants to include a hardfork unless he considers bitcoin to be on the brink of failure.
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:40:37
Yea, even at 8GB bitcoin still wouldn't be able to compete with the likes of visa and mastercard. Mike and Gavin picked those numbers because they believed thats how much computer hardware of the day could handle.  They both admitted that it was only a short term solution to give us breathing room to find a more elegant scaling solution.  
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:57:38
So could Classic theoretically clean up all the bitcoin code with one big hardfork?
@_date: 2017-03-20 00:57:45
The problem with segwit as a softfork is that it makes any future blocksize increases unwieldy.  Also what would have been the harm in just throwing the other side a bone and giving everyone a small hardfork?  Certainly much less precarious than our current predicament.
You may be right about it being about power and politics, but in that regard I would say that core are just as guilty of playing that game.  You have two sides that genuinely believe they have the right of it, I haven't seen any olive branches coming from core
@_date: 2016-01-26 13:32:30
Yea, a lot, which is why it probably wont happen

@_date: 2016-01-31 04:51:40
Lukejr has an idea to implement voting, I don't know how well it will be received though.  It's pretty involved.
I don't think it takes much in the way of developer power to implement a blocksize increase.  If they have the support of companies like coinbase/bitpay then there should be enough developer hours/money for paying developers to go around
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:54:02
That's simply inaccurate.  Core has proved time and again that they are completely unwilling to compromise (or else prone to renegging) on the blocksize issue.   2 years is more than enough time to layout and implement a plan of action.  They've completely dropped the ball and now they are about to lose control of the main chain
@_date: 2017-03-19 20:46:36

@_date: 2016-01-26 14:14:49
The secondary concern you list I can kind of understand, although it seems a bit silly that people as stubbornly resolute on not making a hardfork would somehow let a quick-fix affect their motivation.
The economic risks and concern about hardforks I really can't buy.  If BIP 101 had been implemented waaay back when it was first introduced the community would have had months and months to prep for the change by now, and you can put stipulations in a fork so that it doesn't take effect until a mass momentum of users has switched over and adopted it.  There are plenty of precautions that can be made.
Compare those risks of a hardfork with what has happened to this community in the wake of the blockchain debate and I don't think you could possibly have a worse outcome.  I personally have never been so discouraged with the bitcoin community since I joined back in March 2011.  Price plummets I can take, but having developer skisms and watching the community pull itself apart like what we've seen in the last 6 months is truly heart-wrenching.  
After reading the back and forth between the developers on blogs and twitter and here on reddit, how can I not be just a little frustrated with core?  Would it really hurt so bad to compromise just a little?  When the other side drops from a 20mb quick fix, to 8mb to finally just 2mb and all the different variable solutions in between I honestly don't think there was a hardfork solution ever submitted that would hurt the community as much as the decision to do nothing.
@_date: 2016-01-26 12:48:11
This is the first I've ever heard of such a exploit.  Why isn't it ever brought up in the debate?
@_date: 2016-01-30 19:35:18
The link you posted doesn't answer the question "why not put a hardfork on the roadmap?"  Which is what everyone is upset about and the silence that Erik is referring to 
@_date: 2016-01-26 15:34:45
No, I want to learn about the benefits of segwit as a hard fork.  I think we all already know how the core devs feel about hard forks in general.
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:36:45
Why would that a requirement?
@_date: 2016-06-15 22:59:19
There are a lot of current attack vectors already.  If someone really wanted to take down bitcoin right now for a little while, they could do it.  It can't be that hard for miners to avoid such malicious transactions, or for the protocol to eventually figure out how to not allow such transactions.  When you compare it to the kind of problem we're already facing with the mem-pool backlogs, DoS attack vectors are a non-issue
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:20:51
The vast majority of users are in favor of a blocksize increase, if the protocol worked democratically this change would have happened months ago already
@_date: 2016-06-15 22:25:32
I'm not sure what planet you live on where rising fees and extended backlogs are "desirable"
If you want to downplay the overall hassle that backlogged mem-pool presents to the average savvy bitcoin user, suit yourself.  But this isn't the first time that our front page has been covered with frustrated people complaining about stuck transactions and it certainly won't be the last.  How is that not factor in steering people towards bitcoin alternatives?
And for what reason are we putting up with these backlogs?  All the evidence suggests that the network could easily support up to 10mb blocks with almost no significant centralization effect on nodes.
@_date: 2017-03-22 04:38:52
The only reason segwit isn't being adopted is because core refuses to compromise and make it a hardfork with a blocksize increase.  
@_date: 2016-06-15 23:02:45
I'm the one saying there's no evidence that a blocks smaller than 10mb are going to be a problem.  If you want to say they are a problem, you're the one who needs to bring the citations.  The evidence supporting the need for larger blocks is right in front of our faces with these backlogged mem-pools
@_date: 2016-06-15 21:34:10
It's a lot better than no solution, which is what we're currently dealing with
@_date: 2016-06-15 22:37:38
There are only one or two core devs that are deadset on a 1mb limit. There are a number who even believe that there doesn't need to be any limit at all.
I haven't seen any arguments that an increase of up to 10mb would be harmful.  Only arguments that larger than 10mb it would be harder for nodes in behind the Chinese firewall (read miners) to relay data fast enough. And of course arguments that a contentious hardfork is dangerous.

@_date: 2016-01-26 15:03:27
So this makes big blocks more feasible, right? 
I know BIP 101 had a sighash limitation solution too.  It was obviously just a quick fix, but people seem to be treating the exploit like some kind of nail in the big block coffin.
 
@_date: 2016-06-15 23:25:33
Sure bitcoin is faster and better than fiat alternatives, but its a lot slower than most of the crypto alternatives.  How long can we bank on our first mover advantage?
I've always wondered why we don't keep the same block size and just halve the confirmation times.  Sure, you would need twice the confirmations to ensure the same level of security as before, but having the first confirmation 5 minutes sooner would be pretty nice and we'd still get double the through-put
@_date: 2017-03-20 07:26:21
I know exactly how old the debate is, I watched the whole thing:
Gavin: 20mbs
small blockers: no
Mike and Gavin:  ok fine, just 8mb then
small blockers: no
Classic: 2mb? Please? we seriously need this now
Small blockers: No.  But here's a malleability fix we kind jimmy rigged an awkward softfork transaction increase into.  It's going to make all future blocksize increases super expensive, but you should be grateful we even bothered.
Big blockers: that's really not going to cut it. Segwit would be better as a hardfork and we need something more.
core: no
So here we are.  Its funny all the opposition from core to a hardfork and yet their actions have led us to an even more catastrophic hard fork than anything we might have risked before.

@_date: 2016-01-26 14:41:15
And I personally never found the centralization issue very convincing, especially considering that one of the oft repeated counters to raising the block size is that the mining conglomerates in China wouldn't allow too big an increase because their internet sucks so bad.  Apparently now bitcoin is so centralized that its become subject to the great firewall of China.  I'm also skeptical of the motivations of gmaxwell and adam back probably in the same way you don't trust Mike Hearn.
Also 0 conf has very very very little security as Peter Todd demonstrated with his double spend against coinbase.  That you would even compare the security of a 0 conf transaction with that of a single 5, or even 2 minute confirmation boggles my mind as in the latter cases you would have to coordinate your attack with, at minimum, hundreds of thousands of dollars of mining equipment.
And dismissing 5 minutes as negligible? Really?  I mean that's a serious chunk of time in the financial world
@_date: 2016-06-09 09:31:18
I have never seen a single instance of Erik stirring up drama instead of earnestly trying to work out a serious issue within the community.

Jeez, the comments in this thread highlights everything that is wrong with the community right now.

Seriously though, I think the DAO is a pretty fucking sweet idea and I wish we over here in would give it a little more attention.  If we had some kind of decentralize investment platform that we could participate in as a community to help financially incentivize the developments we'd like to see, how cool would that be?
In order for anyone over here to actually honestly consider it though, you'll have to refrain from using the term" DAO" (or anything that's associated with another crypto for that matter) or referring to the 'Bitcoin Foundation' (or any other group that is not strictly Core)

Is this what bitcoin has come to?  discouraging people from using it as a currency when it is perfectly capable of doing so?  Why the hell wouldn't we just raise the blocksize limit to 2mb until the top layer "currency system" you speak of is released?
@_date: 2016-02-25 09:47:23
We weren't talking about centralization, we were talking about the sustainability of mining fees.
 but since you brought it up,  I'd love to see any evidence  an increase to 2mb would have any effect at all on decentralization.  I don't think that's even an argument at this point.  Right now Core's main objection is that a hardfork must be untertaken carefully, which is ironic because if we had started preparing for the fork 8 months ago when it was first proposed, this entire issue would be behind us and we could be 100% united as a community working on long-term scaling solutions.
We don't need to "focus" on adoption at all, all we need to do is let it happen and remove artificial limits
 
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:33:19


It's kind of impossible not to be affected by increasing transaction fees if you use a payment system.  Even with credit cards the users are affected by the transaction fees in the form of merchants accounting for the fees in their prices.  
If you mean "not affected to the extent that it will prevent them from using the system" that is another argument.  Then the issue becomes how much are people will to pay to use the system?  A few extra cents probably shouldn't deter the average user. But for some, say someone who only wants to transact a few cents in the first place,  a 50+% fee might just be too steep.  The higher the fee, the more and more people will fall into the "affected" category.
The real question is, why put anyone in that category *unnecessarily*?  What are we gaining by reducing the number of transactions?  I haven't heard any arguments saying that 2mb is any worse for block propagation than 1mb.
If I had to choose between deterring a "small number of people" and deterring no people at all, all things being equal, I would opt to deter no people.
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:49:30
There's no evidence whatsoever I've seen that a 2mb increase will have any effect on decentralization or censorship.  If you can show me some, I'd be interested

Yes.. how hostile of him to write those series of reasoned blog posts and make all those compromises to his original plan in order to make as many people as possible happy.  Why didn't he know that core would fight him tooth and nail to make a simple scaling adjustment?
He should have behaved like core and just called everyone who didn't agree him a "populist" who doesn't really understand the issues and refused to compromise even 1 iota 
@_date: 2016-02-25 07:55:32
heh, I think the last 6 months have been the most painful in my experience with bitcoin
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:03:33


Segwit+2mb+thin blocks should give us about 1.5 years of breathing room to come up with a more elegant scaling solution (lightning or what-have-you)  If we simply can't get something working by then, I'd be willing to bump the blocksize to 8mb.  
If 8mb fills up and there's still no scaling solution in sight?  Well fuck I guess we have a problem.  I agree we are many many years away from 32mb, personally I don't think (I hope) we'll ever need more than 8mb.
Like I said, I just want short term room to be able to grow while we work on a serious solution.  If the devs had begun implementing a fork 8 months ago when it was first proposed this entire issue would be behind us and the entire community could be 100% united in core's scaling roadmap.  Instead here are, two people on the same team, bickering about blocksizes
@_date: 2016-02-01 17:48:35
Look, I've read all the back and forth that's happened between gavin and the rest of the core team.  Gavin is anything but a divisive figure looking to cause trouble in the community.  Yes, he has a slightly different vision for the future of bitcoin than you do.  He thinks bitcoin would be better off with more people being able to use it even if it means nodes become more specialized like mining has become.  You seem (understandably) to be more concerned with the corporatization of bitcoin than with its adoption/user experience.  I honestly empathize completely with both sides. You both have valid concerns. But here is the key difference that has myself a significant part of the community following Gavin into the unknown of this  "controversial hard fork.":  Gavin has been striving to strike a balance and find a compromise that will work for the most amount of people.  He didn't just decide to ignore all the objections and dismiss them as "bad technical arguments" although he easily could have.  He's trying his best to find middle ground within the community.
I mean look at you guys:  You even go so far as to admit "nobody's arguing for 1mb forever"  You even propose 2-4-8 as a size increase that shouldn't pose too great a centralization risk.  But then you don't even go about implementing this change in your roadmap, despite overwhelming support.  
Please please please I am begging you, answer me this one question:  If a hardfork is really as dangerous as you claim it is, and you seriously believe that it requires months and months of planning to implement, then why the hell aren't we starting to plan it now??  Why put off the plan?  Don't give me that non-reason about how its not needed right now because segwit gives us all the room we need right now.  Even if you disagree about how dangerously full bitcoin blocks are right now, you have to be smart enough to see what kind impact a gesture like that would have on this community.  
You're basically saying "screw everyone who disagrees with me, I'm not willing to even bump up the timeline of a hard-fork I admit will have happen eventually to bring peace to this community and put an end to this controversy."
That's what it comes down to.  One side is willing to compromise and the other isn't.  I'm just astounded that you'd rather watch the community burn and just sit and blame Gavin, of all people, rather than actually try and fix it.
@_date: 2016-02-25 19:04:09
sustainability is problem we have plenty of time (4+ years) to grapple with.  The blocks are full right now.  You won't have to worry about sustainability of miners fees if bitcoin's scaling limitations push another crypto to preeminence

It doesn't harm decentralization as long as the cost of running a node doesn't outweigh the benefit.  At under 4mb, the costs of running a node are insignificant and not any more noticeably greater, especially with modern hardware 
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:33:20
Ok, lets just just look at the facts:
You say there's no analysis of why a fee event would occur.  Well here's the thing mate:  That's not how risk assessment works.  You don't say, "there's no analysis for why a disaster might occur, therefore we don't need to worry about it".  Otherwise I could just say to small blockers "there's no analysis for why a hardfork might be dangerous" or even "there's no analysis that a miner having more than 50% of the hashrate would actually be a bad thing"   There might not be any concrete data on the subject, but a good plan still maintains an awareness of possibilities.
Is it really so hard to imagine a sharp increase in bitcoin usage?  Look at the history of bitcoin bubbles and transaction volume.  Each bubble has been bigger than the last.  If this next bubble follows that trend it is not that far fetched to imagine transaction volume doubling from its current level in a short amount of time.  Now add to this event a crisis where coinbase has to shut down and a huge percentage of transactions that currently occur off-chain are forced back into the chain.
In this scenario, (which is not any more unfathomable than Adam Back's concern that a government like the US or China will suddenly to and take control of bitcoin network by arresting all the companies who run full nodes) it is not crazy to assume that bitcoin transaction volume would double.  I'm talking about legitimate transaction volume, not spam.  All of a sudden we would be at 160% of capacity with people who just earnestly want to get money from A to B.  What's going to happen now? 
1st A backlog of transactions will rapidly begin to build up.  2nd, as people try and improve their chances of getting included in a block, the fees will start to rise.  Desperate people with important large transactions start putting in stupid high fees just to guarantee that their transactions will get through as the backlog grows.  People see these astronomical fees and start to panic. People either become frustrated that their transactions don't go through reliably or they become disenchanted that it costs $5 to send $3.  The media gets wind of the crisis.  Some altcoin gains critical mass.  Bitcoin becomes the myspace of cryptocurrencies.
You say this is just fud, but its no more fud than "omg hardforks are so dangerous! what if an enterprise that is dumb enough to depend on this experimental currency without keeping its client up-to-date loses money??"  Oh yes, that would be far worse than the risk of thousands of new users being frustrated because their transactions aren't going through even though they included the default fee.

That doesn't answer the question.  I've read the entire blocksize debate and have not read a single credible argument suggesting that 2mb blocks would have significantly more centralizing effects than 1mb blocks.  Screaming about coffee doesn't change that fact that we are crimping the capacity of bitcoin for no other reason than ego at this point

There's nothing incompatible about releasing Segwit in April and a hardfork in June.  I don't understand the point you're making.
Also I'm really skeptical about your claim.  If a dev found an issue that really make segwit and a hardfork incompatible, that fact would be spammed all over this sub and tweeted at jtoomin who says he's planning to implement Segwit into classic as soon as core releases it.
@_date: 2016-02-25 07:48:30
Sure, but in that case a fee increase would occur naturally from market forces rather than an arbitrary cap on the protocol

This whole "we already have political money" meme coming from Adam and the rest really has me scratching my head.  I mean seriously, there is not one thing that voters could do to change the inflation rate of the USD.  That's all controlled by the Fed, aka a bunch of guys behind closed doors making (hopefully) educated decisions about how to deploy the national currency.  
counter to this, the entire  premise of open source software and bitcoin in particular is remarkably "democratic" in the sense that if the users dislike the direction developers are taking, they have not only the right, but the responsibility to fork the code and take it in the direction they desire 'may the best code win'.  The entire security model of bitcoin is based on the idea the majority get to decide which transactions are valid and which are not.
I agree that mining centralization is a big problem for bitcoin, but this line of reasoning saying "democratic money is more akin to fiat than bitcoin" completely baffles me
@_date: 2016-02-24 07:55:41


Literally billions.  It's in most electronics.
Oh, did you mean as a currency?  Well still a butt-load more than bitcoin.  Count how many gold-for-cash stores you see vs any store that accepts bitcoin.
Seriously though, more users directly corresponds to more value.  The only reason the bitcoin price bubbled before it achieved a mass effect of users was because of all the speculators who were betting that bitcoin would eventually draw mass amounts of users.  If those users never come, the price will plummet.

I've been following this debate for a year now and I still have not read a single argument saying that 2mb presents a significantly greater risk than 1mb.  I'm 100% with you in dreaming for a collaborated, accelerated scaling solution, but it baffles my mind that core would prefer the drama of the never-ending blocksize debate over a short-term 2mb concession. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:55:09
Yes, but price volatility :(
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:06:26

@_date: 2016-02-25 07:52:33
That's not really true.  If bitcoin fails, there will be a reason.  Developers will look at that reason and come up with ideas to avoid that reason reoccurring. There's no way to undo the breakthroughs we've made so far

Sucks when developers try to keep the community in the loop, doesn't it?  
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:30:11


Because the greatest bottleneck in the bitcoin system is the chinese firewall, which data suggests can handle likely up to 8mb blocks and easily 4mb.


Says someone who's against a size increase for a reason unspoken.
People who want to increase the blocksize are looking at the current blocks and saying "Hey, these are really full, we should raise the limit so that we can have more transactions while we develop better scaling solutions"
People who are against raising the blocksize are saying "no, that's risky, something bad might happen, like centralization"
Who seems to be acting more out of fear?
@_date: 2016-02-25 09:13:18
No, they'll pay more because the miners will decide that they wont accept transactions lower than a certain fee.
@_date: 2016-02-25 07:59:07
If I was going to pick an order of which problem to solve first, I'd errr on the side of promoting adoption and then tackle sustainability with the force of a much larger economy giving me momentum 
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:46:47
Just because bitcoin will never be able to be low cost forever for billions of people doesn't mean we need to start raising the fees right now.  If transactions had not been free when bitcoin first came out, nobody would have been interested.  Likewise there is no reason to have transactions cost more than they need to now.  The more attractive we can keep bitcoin now, the more mainstream it will become.  Why charge a dime when a nickle will suffice?  Wait for the fee market to develop when its truly needed.
@_date: 2016-02-25 21:05:13

No, they didn't.  Maybe you could make that argument if there was anybody running for congress on the platform of writing a law that somehow changed the way the entire federal currency system works, but no such option exists for the people.

I think we might just have found common ground. Cheers to that
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:12:39
Yes, they certainly should be.  And then they should raise the blocksize limit to a reasonable number to insure that the growth of bitcoin does not slow and all their hard work goes to waste.
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:46:28


This is the correct answer that everybody on the core side seems to be shirking away from.
All the mumbo jumbo about hardfork risks is about ego preservation at this point because here's a simple fact:  If we had begun taking the necessary time and preparation for a hardfork 8 months ago when it was first proposed, this entire issue would be behind us now.  We wouldn't have had the mike hearn fallout, gavin/garzick split, and the community would be 100% united in a long-term scaling solution.  Instead we're still sitting here as a broken community bitching at each other about the exact same issues except now we're just more deeply entrenched in our beliefs
@_date: 2016-02-25 09:23:07
No, What is happening right now is that miners are being forced to ignore transactions because of an arbitrary transaction limit set in the protocol. 
However miners are free to institute what ever limitations they want on which transactions to include, so if he wanted, a miner could say "no transactions under $3"  and anyone who wanted to be included in that miner's block would be required to pay a $3 transaction fee.
If you want to argue that eventually blocks will be full if we raised the transaction limit now, I would simply reply lets go ahead and let that happen later once we've got better scaling solutions implemented
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:20:19
So that's our solution to the problem?  Just keep lowering the standard of use cases that bitcoin qualifies for?  
I've got an idea..  How about we just remove the artificial cap on transactions so that we don't repel users while we figure out a genuine scaling solution
@_date: 2016-02-25 19:26:09


How long does it take to implement a blocksize increase?  According to core "6-12 months"
Sounds like we should start working on it now.


People are already spending 8c to "guarantee" a confirmation.  I'm not saying that's insanely high, or that it is a normal occurrence, or that 6c wouldn't work just as well.  I just feel like your blase "nothing to see here folks" attitude is a bit cavalier and perhaps willfully short-sighted.  The time to start working on a crisis is well before an issue ever becomes a crisis.
All that said, I will concede your main point:  We are not, at this time, in a crisis.
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:47:40
Let me into your would.  How much does it cost to run a node?
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:42:18
Fine, whatever economic consensus means to you, a fork still facilitates the will of that consensus whenever it diverges from the will of the developers. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 19:17:26


Nobody has ever said it was otherwise. We simply don't want higher fees and longer confirmation times scaring away newcomers while we implement more advanced scaling solutions


We don't need it to be optimized before raising it to 2mb.  2mb won't hurt anything.  We can still optimize the network while working with a slightly increased block size.
I don't blame you for staying with core, but I think that core is seriously creating a lot of strife in the community by refusing to do a simple 2mb increase that would eliminate all the bickering here and bring everyone together on the same team
@_date: 2017-04-04 12:04:32
Bitcoin has already lost 40% of its market share to this stagnation.  What you are saying is that if we can't achieve absurdly high consensus, (which is becoming more glaringly obvious every passing day) then Bitcoin becomes usurped, loses all its first moved advantage, and eventually fails outright against more innovative coins. How is this OK?
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:24:45
really, we're inflicting data caps and inhibiting adoption so that we can gather data for a change that is 4+ years away? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard 
@_date: 2016-02-24 09:03:37
Nobody is saying it must.  We're only saying, why hamper its use as a low cost currency unless we have to?
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:26:06
I'm not sure why you'd presume a flex cap automatically = centralization.  
The biggest bottleneck in the bitcoin system is the Chinese firewall. China houses 80%+ of bitcoin mining power.  So "giant" blocks would mean that Chinese miners would be at a disadvantage.  What this means practically is that we will have very few "giant" blocks and that there will be more incentive to migrate mining operations outside of China.
If you're worried about a drop in full nodes, I would just posit this: If we get to the point that we are seeing giant blocks being mined by miners, it likely means we've seen an exponential increase in userbase which would likely translate to an increase in people willing to run full nodes
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:53:30
If you can show me any evidence that an increase to 2mb will have any effect on centralization I would love to see it.  As far as I'm aware, the data suggests that the great firewall in china, which is the greatest bottleneck in block propagation, can easily handle up to 4mb blocks, and outside of china 8mbs should fall well within acceptable bandwidth limitations for current technology
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:56:50
The thing about open source tech though is that it evolves.  If a change isn't "good"  then it reacts and changes back.  This evolution is crucial to stay relevant in todays world.  But in order for a system to evolve healthily it must be allowed to make changes.
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:37:21
Is there really anyone who is concerned about the centralization effects of 2mb over 1mb?
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:19:32
Since when did the recommended fee become "retardedly low"
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:23:00
Why?  Seriously.. The biggest bottleneck I'm  aware of is the Chinese firewall and that should be completely fine up to 4mb
@_date: 2016-02-24 10:09:15
The problem arises when near universal consensus can't be obtained in a timely fashion.. I highly doubt we will ever achieve this kind of consensus in regards to the current blockchain issue.  The next best thing is super majority.  If I had to choose between a governing system that was consensus driven and gridlocked vs split via super majority, I would choose the the majority hands down.  Technology like bitcoin must be able to progress or it will quickly become over-taken by competitors in some form or another
@_date: 2016-02-25 19:05:49
If people are the reason, we'll just code people out of the equation.  It's a bummer that the bitcoin code didn't have a governance protocol, but I'm sure that everybody in the open source crypto space is thinking about governance now
@_date: 2016-02-25 08:04:29
Somehow I think 8 years is plenty of time to work it out, which is how much time we have before the reward falls below 6btc.  Compare that to blocksize which is already operating at max capacity and I don't see how anyone could be worried about sustainability
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:54:29
But the 'competition' will have more 100% more breathing room while they develop more advanced scaling measures
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:39:17
If its inevitable, lets go ahead and let it happen 4+ years from now when the reward really starts to drop instead of prematurely forcing it before it gains a mainstream userbase.
@_date: 2016-02-01 17:00:02
yes because this is the only decision in bitcoin that that ever has or ever will be controversial  
@_date: 2016-02-24 10:10:35
(btw, I'm not downvoting you)
@_date: 2016-02-24 10:18:32


The alternative seems pretty clear, for the short-term at least: raise the blocksize.  I'm pretty sure the entire issue could be laid to rest if this one little change was made. 2mb isn't going to hurt anything, even less so than pre-maturly limiting on-chain transactions.  There's no reason we can't pursue all scalable solutions AND have a 2mb blocksize.  Personally I'm baffled that core would rather drag the community through all this drama rather than make a single, easy, harmless, concession.
@_date: 2016-02-24 07:40:14
technically yes, functionally its more of an oligarchy much like Russia or China
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:09:50
I can't believe you are even trying to shift blame to Gavin right now.  Back in March 2015 he predicted Blocks would be full by March 2016 and now look at where we're at.  Gavin compromized from 20mb to 8mb to finally now 2mb and still Core has not budged. It is 100% their stubborn refusal to cooperate with anyone that has put us in this situation.  Even now they are sitting there, plunger in hand, watching the network clog while countless transactions pile up in an ever-growing backlog
@_date: 2016-02-29 22:12:49
Great.  Now the mainstream media is airing out our dirty little secret.  This is going to do wonders for adoption, right guys?  Totally worth it
@_date: 2016-02-01 18:39:27
Well, if you can produce it, I guess I'll concede the point
@_date: 2016-02-25 20:57:31
yes, potentially
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:35:46
I'm not sure why you put that sarcasm tag.  There are no arguments that I'm aware of that posit that 2mb blocks would lead to any more centralization than 1mb blocks
@_date: 2016-02-24 08:41:42
Core has spoken on the matter many many times.  I have never once heard them express concern over the increasingly filling blocks.  How exactly do you think their opinion diverges from how it is represented?
@_date: 2016-02-29 23:23:18


It will make the attack twice as expensive and give us more time to fix the problem instead of starting a premature fee event
@_date: 2016-02-25 07:56:50
Nobody wants to make the block size too large.  We want to make it a reasonable size. 2mb isn't going to do anything to decentralization
@_date: 2016-02-25 07:46:47
That's such a gargantuan leap to believe might come from a 1 mb increase in blocksize I can't imagine anyone taking it seriously

Honestly, I would love for bitcoin to get away from mining altogether.  I know this is a hugely unpopular opinion in this sub, but honestly mining feels like the chink in bitcoin's armor.  All this corporation interest, money, hardware, leading to centralization and special interest..  It just feels very unattractive.
I know many people think PoS is a centralization scheme etc.. but why can't we figure out a way for hashing power to simultaneous be used for something good, like folding proteins or advancing science somehow?
Look at how confident the devs are that they can fix bitcoin's scalability issues with a couple conferences.. Why can't we put that can-do attitude towards something huge, like dual purpose hashing algorithms?
@_date: 2015-09-09 09:11:32
It's actually quite a bit worse since, you know, open source projects are meant to be forked.
As an objective user who doesn't really care which direction the protocol takes, I have to say that Mike and Gavin have been very earnest, open, and communicative throughout this entire debate, whereas Greg Maxwell and Co come off as being spiteful and elitist.
I like that bitcoin is being forked because I think that more iterations make for a healthier, more resilient project, but it but all the politics, infighting, and character attacks on amazing hardworking coders is really sad to see
@_date: 2015-09-02 04:09:07
Personally I don't understand the gravity of this letter.  I guess It's nice to see the dev team reaching out to the community like this and I feel bad that they aren't feeling the love from the community that they obviously deserve for all their hard work.  
But all they are saying in regards to blocksize is that they have some conferences lined up.  Which is nice, but not exactly substantial.  If something substantial comes out of the conferences and a near-term solution reaches consensus, then awesome, we'll all be stoked.  But in the meantime, I'm grateful XT exists as a viable alternative that will be ready when we need it and I honestly can't understand where all the hate for Hearn and Gavin is coming from.  As far as I can see, they haven't said anything that is untrue and their intentions are for the best for bitcoin as far as they are able to see it.
This letter just feels a little too salty and divisive to me

I can respect that you personally disagree with the hardfork. I can respect that your opinion is to classify the fork as "contentious" or "hostile".  
I can't respect you trying impose your opinions on the community via censorship.
I honestly think that this 'fear of the fork' mentality is far far more harmful to bitcoin than having multiple iterations of the protocol even if they really are "hostile".

All the big exchanges are already moving to start accepting alt-coins, its only a matter of time before the rest of the infrastructure catches up.  The idea that allowing more transactions to occur on the bitcoin network will somehow create a bigger centralization problem than we already have with Chinese miners is laughable. If anything, bigger blocks will create a more decentralized network by encouraging mining operations to pop up outside the Great Firewall

First off, Gavin didn't create the analogy, another core dev did and Gavin was just going along with it because he's accommodating and actually tries to meet people at their level.

We already have a centralization bottle neck in the shape of chinese miners, bigger blocks are not going to create any more of a centralization issue than we already have.  If anything bigger blocks will relieve mining centralization by allowing for more users and encouraging more mining operations to setup outside of the great firewall
