Check out paxful. They cover US and most of the countries. They also have different types of payment methods to choose from for your convenience. They use escrow and have 24/7 support. That is where I started with my bitcoin investment. I haven't had any issues at all. In fact, they helped me all through out.

This is nice to hear that there is an ATM now open for bitcoins. But still rather buy bitcoins from Paxful and similar sites. Rather stay at home and online.

Good luck to your money! Thankful I'm with paxful and not with coinbase. same issues I heard from bitcoin friends.

I heard that issues from bitcoin friends as well. Lucky I am that I didn't go to coinbase. I've known paxful.com from another friend who just started his trade so I let him do it for months to see how it goes. It went now into my turn that I am ready to trade. I signed-up with paxful and I had no regrets!

I'm with you. I trade in Pax months already and I don't have any problems nor issues at all. They are great!

It doesn't matter where you are or which country you are in.   You can buy bitcoins thru paxful.com They offer different payment methods for your convenience. They have 24/7 support and video tutorials. They offer good rate as well. This is why I like paxful much than the others.

paxful.com offers bitcoin to Amazon GF or vice versa with good rates. Legit site to trade. Better check it out ;)

If I only listened to my friend who looked dumb when he was explaining this thing 2 to 3 years ago. I'm sure, I will have thousands of $$$ now like him. He traded thru paxful where he got started buying and selling his bitcoins.
Oh well, repentance is always late :(

I was ignorant before with bitcoins. It was my kid, a 7 yrs old kid who actually introduced me into this Bitcoin world. I ignore her at first but she keeps on talking about this. What she keeps on telling me was, She wants to lend money from me using my credit card to buy her bitcoins because she wants it to grow so she can buy an iPhone from her bitcoin savings on her own...Whatta smart kid! :)

nah! exchange rate is low. I'd rather buy bitcoins with paxful.com in a good rate with no hassle!

Damn! This is why I hate Kraken! I am able to transfer my bitcoins from paxful where I trade and receive my money in less than 24 hrs.

Another option I suggest is paxful.com they are reliable. I'm one of the pax traders.
