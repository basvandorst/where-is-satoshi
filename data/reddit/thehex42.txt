Human nature people don’t want to accept they may have made a bad decision either way so try to compensate for it by convincing others that their the ones who made a bad decision then things can get nasty depending how how strongly they feel about it
Just look at religion some people will kill to convince others the choice they (the killers) made is the right one

Just checked my hashflare account according to them the transaction began at 03:00 24-11-17 and is pending I was thinking maybe it was a problem with the Bitcoin transaction being confirmed my first purchase with it but then when I bought the BTC it came through much faster so idk

I don't know I ran the calculator and it seemed like a good idea at the current price and if it goes up well that's even better but my question has more to do with the confirmation time this is my first time buying something with bitcoin and it's taking days I'm wondering why

Around here many places use baseboard electric heaters
