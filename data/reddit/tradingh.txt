It's simple, once you send them the Bitcoin you don't hear from them.

Buy high, sell low is the new trending of the year!  
I very much don't care, I did not invest in btc in the hope to do quick money, it was clear to me from the moment I buy my first bit that the days of cashing out will be way far down the road.  
Once in a while when I see big volatility I do some trading to increase my stake, but I hate looking at these charts every day so I limit myself to the few time when I imagine I can see where the market is going. I don't have a crystal ball, sometimes my trades end-up to not be so good, I still end-up bits and bits each week or month.  
A lot of my friends also have some crypto (a lot bought xrp at 2$ hahaha (I'm for nothing in that)). The fun part is that when I ask them if they ever read the white paper of the crypto they invest in, they ask me what is a white paper! :(

Did I ever call anyone stupid ? No. I'm in the same boat as many, the big picture of my crypto investment is down 35% and I keep buying more each time it reach a new low... I'm simply preaching for smart investment and not taking debts to invest in crypto cause I can't predict when it will bounce back, so it's perfectly fine to invest in anything if you can afford to wait a long time before it bounce back. It's reckless to invest in something if you have a certain amount of week/month before your margin call/credit card interest kick in and get everything you got.  
And yes somehow it's perfectly normal that when the debts obligation is at is 10 years low, a synthetic market like the crypto market is also at is lowest (that market doesn't even have 10 years history, so it's lowest right now is not even a years and half low, dont seams that bad).   
I'm reading this sub-reddit and I'm actually very surprise to read more and more persons that got themself loan or credit card debts to buy more crypto at hight price. It the last bear market I did not see that. To be perfectly honest I start buying in 18 months ago, and like many back in last November I started to load my credit card to buy more bitcoin thinking this was a sure gain. Hopefully for me, my credit score was so low, that I could not even reach 5K before I reach the limit of my available credit! When February hit, I realize It was not going to bounce back as easily as I was visualizing it. So I went back to work to clear my credit, put some money aside and keep on buying some extra bitcoin.  
I still remain very bullish and each time it will reach a new low, I'll buy some, but I still preach for smart investment and not getting in to debts in the sole purpose of buying crypto.

Nothing stop you from doing so, you just don't have the balls to do so or the capital. But the margin call itself will be a bummer...
@_date: 2018-11-24 23:13:24
Ppl here look only at the crypto market price. Look at other market, almost all market are down currently, most big and stable company are down, the price of gaz is down and event more important the debt obligation market is at is lowest since 2008.  
The crypto market has no reason to be more stable than any other market, quiet the contrary it is a extremely volatile market. It's perfectly normal than the market is at is lowest as the entire monetary supply is shrinking currently. 
Everyone assume than to protect yourself from a recession you should invest in gold, this is true only if you can afford to not sell your gold till the market start going back up. In peak of the recession even the gold price crash as everyone have to feed them-self and will gladly sell gold to do so. The crypto market is a cross in-between gold and extremely volatile market. It's a great store of value over 10-20 years but it is extremely volatile on short term.  
Keep stacking if you can afford it, do not take any loan for it, pay your loan before investing and keep a stash of money to cover 6 months of living before investing in something extremely risky. I'm personally very bullish on bitcoin on the long run, I also control very well my expense, I don't have any debts and I have cash money in hand to cover many months of living. I can afford to hodl for a very longtime without any impact on my life. Bitcoin is a way for me to store money that I'll probably have find reason to spend on stupidity if it was simply sleeping in my bank account!

I have no pretension on trying to even comprehend why the price fall. Bitcoin died already so many time, we can't also only judge something by his pass record. But I still think that there is very few other blockchain that can show better track record than btc and with the way the current world wide monetary system work vs the way the bitcoin system work. I believe the chance that bitcoin is worth less or equal is current value in a 5 years time frame is very low. To that I'll add that, everything is possible (and this is a sentence that I try to repeat to myself every morning (but with a different purpose in mind lol). So I still prefer transforming and keeping all my long term saving in bitcoin.

If we talk about barrowing money on a crypto exchange (I guess borrowing USDT) then no explanation needed, but you will need capital and then if you barrow at a hight margin rate. It will be a problem with the margin call as you will need more capital that you actually use to borrow to cover the fluctuations of the market.

The Yuan is not back by gold, the oil contract that china is offering is... Not the same
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:20:57
Of course and when I'll have grow my investment enough and lower my cost, I'll be one of them for sure. I actually fairly recently move much more of my capital in crypto and planning in a short period of time to be my biggest income. At that point I estimate 80% of my incomes will be from crypto and therefore I'll be spending much more Bitcoin. Although I still find it extremely volatile for day to day purchase. I mean if you know you are going to spend 500$ over the weekend, 4 time out of 5 you will be advise to sell 500$ worth of BTC on Friday and paid with fiat. It's almost like applying day trading practice to your entire money flow.

Sorry but I still don't agree with you, demand and over, more any asset is in demand more price will raise. Since the BTC is limited and there is a lot of Holder more trade happen in BTC more the demand for it will increase that will increase the value of it.
If tomorrow all the country agree to stop using the USD as the petrodollar the USD will lose in valuation since at that point they will be way too much USD in circulation for the amount of trade made with it.

Any website that will sell you gold for BTC ?
I'm not talking about paper gold... but real gold that you can touch !
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:21:56
Most of the website will charge you a % fees in fiat ($) some website will apply that fees on top of the amount purchase, as other website will take that fees on the amount purchase. Rare are the website charging there fees in BTC on funding operation... (as far as i'm aware)
The fees % will variate from one website to a other and specially from one funding method to a other (CC, bank transfer...)
Shop around some website will have low fees but sale BTC at a higher price than other, other website have hight fees but sale BTC cheaper...
@_date: 2018-11-27 01:50:37
It's not because a shitcoin as a lot of volume that is give it good valuation over time. I believe ABC and SV are both equally shitcoin. Absolutely not decentralize. Now both team have to create some volume and news to sell there FOMO to newbies that will buy. The big winner in that story is Bitmain that got 2 stupid human to rent a lot of hash to fight a stupid war and now they have a million of shitcoin on each chain to sell!

at least a good week, I bought fews a week a go and saw the option... Since BTC is lower than what I believe its wroth  currently I did not use it.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:25:15
I hope for BTC at 2.5k today or over the week-end.
@_date: 2017-09-16 04:50:22
Yeah they bean kind of force to with the American sanction. But at the end of the day they are probably not really winner doing so, I don't believe they import as much from china as they will possibly export oil... 
@_date: 2017-09-26 15:36:04
Of course, it depend from where you have your income coming from, fiat or btc, if you buy BTC (+fees) to right away at almost same value go buy something with it, when you can use paypal or cc. Then there is not much advantage. But if you have bought your BTC lower and then buy stuff with it when its at a higher val. then its good. It's the equivalent of doing a good trade.
In my case, I for now simply want to grow my investment wallet, and that specific day that I bought these domain the bitcoin was much lower, I was buying some bitcoin that same day, I found it quite useless to pay this way...
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:01:31
Then there is no trouble, also they seams to be pretty fast to move there business else where. They can easily setup shop anywhere else if China decide to apply the ban to Hong-Kong as well. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:22:27
Like I said before, you don't have to convince me.
That said, everyone have a different strategy and a different vision and if we where all in sync that will not be good for anyone.
Personally I try to not think to far ahead, I'm definitely not going to HOLD till 100K, even if I hope its going to hit it, I'll had sold and bought back many time in between...
@_date: 2017-09-19 04:04:17
Make sens, but still even do Canada do have a hight level of debt.

@_date: 2017-09-16 05:13:57
China is simply wishing for other country else than Russia and Iran (and now Venezuela) will want there Yuan in exchange for Oil. To sweeten the deal they offer a Gold alternative, simply put they will buy oil for gold ! If that push many country to accept the deal, then yes the USD could lose value. (And yes that is just a good news for BTC holder)

Is it on the "on pending" transaction or really it bean already fews days ?
Sometimes you can see duplicate when still in pending, i guess for system glitch. But if you bean really fully charge 4 times for one single transaction and it bean a fews days already... this is odd, definitely contact Coinbase...
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:05:59
Ok and what is the link with BTC ?
@_date: 2018-11-25 11:33:22
I love all these capitulation message, I'm wondering at this point if the economy in general is about to tank or will it bouce back faster than I'm currently assuming... I'll love much lower price, I will like to stack more. Its perfectly normal to redraw yourself from this market if you are overexposed. From the beginning this was not a get rich quick sheme and if you will have done your homework you will have sean that this market have had many big winter even in perfect economic growth time (with bitcoin bean invented at the end of 2008, it actually did not yet experienced a recession). I'm betting for a much harder crypto winter than what we experience before, follow by a big growth but that can easily be in 6-18 months. Weather the storm!
@_date: 2017-09-16 18:30:04
But still for example, if this news :  go true, gold price will rise as demand will increase !
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:21:56

The comment as I read it from his friends is valid, the date is to be confirm. But this kind of news have lil to do with bitcoin. If this is correct (and if many country start claiming chinese gold) it will most likely rise the price of gold and if really this change significantly the market cap of the petrodollar. Then maybe we will see the USD dropping in value... That can result in a increase value of the BTC/USD pair... but seriously... the BTC is really to volatile that I don't believe we will really associate any increase in price to this news...
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:27:40
We are Friday, there is also a lot of chance to see the price falling again over the weekend ! In china its midnight right now, in 6-7 hours when many will wake-up and read the news, a other big sale is really possible !
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:53:38
I'm happy about the news, I was just expressing some scepticisme. Specially because of the timing of the news and the amount of big company name in the news...
My point was more than to be competitive on bitcoin tendance is to have lower fees than conventional payment method, therefore they may lose some income. At the end of the day, I strongly believe that crypto is really close to mass adoption so they are also kind of force to work on those solution as no company want to end-up like Kodak !
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:25:31
Many different strategy are use by different bot, any trading strategy that can be logically or mathematically explain, can be programed !

I went a head and did start the project, 
This is a screen from the preset list (no particular order and small sample) 
So basically, I select the pair, the buying option (When price fall under), the buying price, the selling option (When price rise over OR When profits (%) is over) then the selling price OR % increase, then the amount. (on the example I keep it small for running test).
I'm running it on Bitfinex, for now, the script already calculate 0.2% fees on top of the preset selling price or %. Simple tache cron php script with sql db is running it. 
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:08:57
It can easily never happen...
Since bitcoin is limited to 21'000'000
Even if you can divide each BTC in 100M satoshi.
There is already too many person having more than 1 BTC to give the chance for billion of person to ever own BTC...
Over the mid/long term, if Bitcoin remain "THE crypto currency" then it will probably take a statue more like the actual gold, where some rich, bank, gouvernement and big corporation hold most of it as a hight value assets. But commun folks will probably have all sold there BTC
@_date: 2018-11-22 00:21:21
Of course, but as any purchase you still "should" try to rationalize your move. (And the same apply for your sell)  
If someone walk-in a electronic store and see the TV of his dream at 20K, woah that is expensive, he buy or not it's is choice and have to make peace with it. But if at the end of the year the store is offering that same TV at 4K, the logic is to assume that more ppl should take advantage of it.  
But you are very right, and even Apple understand it. This is why years after years they increase there price. I bet that if tomorrow Apple was giving a 75% discount on all there latest models, almost no one will go buy one simply cause they will assume that apple is going to crash.  
We human are so weird, often I control myself by thinking that if I do something that is very much against popular momentum, this is probably the right move to do and when I start to do the exact same thing than everyone else, now I get scare.  
It remind me me the movie World War Z, when they go in Israel to try to find why they figure out why the zombies attack was a real thing way before everyone else. The guy told them, when everyone think something is impossible, it's my duty to think differently !  
@_date: 2017-09-15 14:18:36
I bet the same, its quite rare to see the price rise over weekend (it happen but that not the norm) with all these news, I wish for a low price over weekend :)

Just try and it does not work under iOS
So you can access website under iOS without mining, even if the script is on the website.
@_date: 2017-09-14 12:33:08
Don't worry most don't panic, they just sale to buy lower ;)
And by making something illegal, don't make it more expensive. If you refer to things like drugs, its also because when it's illegal supply decrease as when a product is legal supply will be easier to get. In the case of BTC, yes of course the price of the BTC sold on black market will rise, but not necessarily the price on the remaining exchanger. Since they will be less volumes on thoses exchangers and more trade will be made in person.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:07:32
@_date: 2017-09-16 15:10:49
the problem is I don't know any website that will allow you to buy BTC without any account validation and that can take a fews days.
If time is such a issues, I guess bitcoin ATM is your answer !
@_date: 2017-09-23 01:47:41
As far as there is volatility and volume, I really don't care in witch direction it goes !
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:49:23
Yes and its back to 3'500, give it a other 30 mins and chance are its going to be close to 3.2k
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:25:24
Yeah of course, it's definitely not the end of the world. But I was more curious as witch valuation they base there fare on ?
From one exchanger to a other price can be different by fews 100$
I also know some store that do accept bitcoin but some charge a % fees to cover them-self from hight volatility. In my mind it should be the opposite as you should get a discount to paid with BTC as more and more ppl are farrelly confident that it will rise in value...
@_date: 2017-09-25 23:16:56
You are welcome,
What i found funny of this article is the solidity they give to gold investment, they do praise bitcoin a lot for is fast increase in values, they still close the article saying that diversify investment is the best. Although, of course not having in eggs in the same basket is a core principe in investment. I'll not suggest to anyone to invest in gold for some key factor:
1. 2/3 of all Gold sold exist under gold paper only. Meaning that gold did not be mine, is not own by the institution that sell-it and simply does not exist. That is why most institution will tell you that they keep the gold for you in there vault, most will not allow to send you that gold and will charge you storage fees. Since they don't have the gold its extremely lucrative to charge you fees for nothing. If political instability or anything else push ppl to cash back there gold investment, they will not get that gold but the fiat value of the gold at that time. Since many will like to touch there money at the beginning of a crisis, the price will likely fall at the beginning and only after raise if the crisis continue. (Like in 2008, the price of gold drop and only 2009 and after that it rebound).
2. Security reason, country like Argentina where inflation bean higher than bank interest, population stat to keep there money at home since there is no point to keep it at the bank and pay fees on it while the interest rate don't even cover the inflation. The rubbery increase dramatically since everyone know that the chance that cash is hidden in a house are now hight. Then imagine if someone know you have gold. If you have a lot, you have to put a side money only for your security system, safe, alarm... The money you put to secure your investment is now a expense and not longer is a investment. Compare that to bitcoin, if you have a cold wallet, with your wallet adresse in your head or a small piece of paper.. much easier to hide and secure...
3. Utilization, even if we all at one point dream of having a lingo of gold, Even in post apocalypse world, I don't see myself going to pay something and try to give 1/10 of my lingo to someone, you will say there is gold coin as well, still not really good for change... Maybe I just wanted a can of soup !

@_date: 2017-09-30 22:32:23
Does not look like a Bitcoin shop... In that case BTC probably just a abreviation/nickname for Boutique 
@_date: 2017-09-14 15:52:28
But when you read a news like that early in the morning, why you don't sell your overprice coin and by them back later in the day, when the news have made the tour of the globe and the BTC have drop 4-500$ ?
I feel like most morning, if you wake up ealy, you can have a feel of the market, the news and see where its going from there. 
Everywhere, everyone said Hold, but I'm sure so many hold all there coins at 5k$ and now its probably going to take a other months just to pass it again... At that point most will sale at 5K just because they feel it bean to long they where stock on that position ! 
If you sale and buy during a dip, you can lower your price and clear some more money to invest and buy more coins with that same money. When it go up you then make much more money.
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:24:50
Any website that will sell you gold for BTC ?
I'm not talking about paper gold... but real gold that you can touch !

@_date: 2017-09-15 16:24:00
At the end of the day, the market is so volatil that it does not really matter. Some sold at 3K this morning, and if they are lucky enough they will be able to buy back lower over the weekend (at worst they can possibly wait for similar price at the end of October), some other have bought in at 3k today and if they sold it right now, they are already 20% up in profits (not to bad in fews hours) and if they wait Monday they will be probably much more profitable. 
My point is, there is so much movement in the market that as far as you dont panic and get stupid you can easily make amazingly good trade no matter the direction you are trading !
@_date: 2017-09-14 16:53:37
Yeah with the week-end coming, price can easy go down to 3'200 or 3k :)
@_date: 2017-09-15 17:28:02
Yeah, also look at some of the Alt coins, some of them have really big UP and DOWN following the time of the day. like OmiseGo
@_date: 2017-09-27 17:24:51
Investing in Crypto is good, the amount you have to your disposition is good enough to engage in a fews different strategy, depending on the interest and time you are welling to put to gain knowledge and follow news of each crypto. Depending the daily or weekly time you want to put in you can go from simply holding it, some arbitrage trading or really trading it daily. Each will require a level of commitment higher to be more up-beat on news and new tech. 
But Crypto is extremely volatile and even if the increase in value over time is "almost" certain, large drop is still a reality and 5% - 10% drop in a matter of hours or days is recurrent. For that Crypto investment require some mental control or mental straight to resist at the urge of selling, its not everyone that stay relax seeing there 20k investment 10% down days after you invest in it.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:56:31
Not the best, but not the worst. Also notice something about "most" of the country in green and light yellow ?
Yep most of the country that have the lowest debt per capita in the world are the most undeveloped country... It easy, since the fractional reserve banking we are running a economy base on debt. Meaning that the amount of debt is bound to constantly rise, each time a central bank create money, a interest is directly link to that money, meaning that they will always be more debt that actual money...
I imagine that all BTC holder are not supporter of that system, but for now, its still how it work. So a rapid increase of debt for one single country is dangerous, but when all major economy debt rise at the same pace, its also sign of economy growth.
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:24:58
Hahaha there go a other really useless coin !
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:49:42
1) Of course it's not easy, we also all know that risk is much higher than forex and others. I try not to make any predictions on bottom and top. At the end of the day, any actions you do is a bit of a bet. There is never one single person that can predict the price. My point was that if you inform yourself, and you imagine that most trader do, most have access to the same information so you can imagine that most will react the same way.
2) I'm not in US, then for me if I follow my country of residence income is income, as any income that I add in my tax report will be tax the same. But a smarter man can also open a bank on some overseas territory (Virgin island, Bahamas, Turks &amp; Caicos and Bermuda) have some great tax agreement with many country and great tax rate :)
3) I have different investment strategy, long term are on cold wallet, then i keep my short term on exchanger and if I sell off I'll keep the money on the exchanger to be ready to buy back in. I do try to avoid as much as possible to transfert money back and forward to my bank account to avoid all those fees and wait time.
I did not wanted to sound a smartass for my previous comments, my point was that I often see when a massive trend take form, that trend stay for a fews hours, specially in the morning the time that many woke up around the US especially and asses the situation.
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:55:25
I can imagine you are talking about this:
 &amp;&amp;/||
If this article is right, that is only for oil, so we are not talking about a new currency but only contract with nation exporting crude oil (and there is for now probably just 3 country that will accept these terms (Russia (already sale crude for Yuan since 2015), Iran and Venezuela).
So we are not talking about a new yuan or a digital one... no,
China bean since a wile trying to buy oil in Yuan (of course they are printing it out of fine air like the FED) the only difference now is that those Yuan will be exchangeable for gold. So for country like Venezuela that can't do much with Yuan its good to be able to have some gold... And I guess they want to attract more country this way... 
But as much as we all love gold, it's still not really particle, take Venezuela situation for example, they have a national oil company that cost more to operate that the current price of oil, so we can imagine that 100% of all income from oil sale go back to immediate use by the gouvernement, (paid there employee, buy food for the country...) So as much as they will love to put there hand on some gold to stabilize the value of there currency, they probably can't spare any and will end-up having to exchange there Yuan or Gold in USD, because they just don't buy much from China.
And I don't think we will see a Yuan backed by gold anytime soon, even if China does have the biggest reserve in gold in the world. They bean manipulating there currency to keep it really low value, to help export. If they back there currency with gold, the currency will gain value and that definitely not what they are looking for.

Totally, I'm far from a holder, much more of a day trader. On the other hand Holding is good to to stabilize, I can imagine that if a to large % of the bitcoin is trade each day it will make the whole thing much more volatile.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:37:03
There should be 30 years left to the "One contry, Two system".
Not sure China will respect that... They already did a lot to bring Hong-Kong under there control. And I don't think China have any intention to convince Taiwan... One day they will simply do what Russia did with Crimea...(They just have to grow some balls first) The commun mindset of most of Chinese is already that Taiwan is China. Every years China move toward that goal by removing Taiwan from more and more international organization...  
Actually China don't recognize Taiwan as a country, but as a China territory, therefore when a Taiwanese go to China, China don't recognize there passport and actually give them a Chinese passport...

I believe some website like Coinbase have API kit you can setup on your site. But I can imagine these system will not be as "transparent" or "unlimited" in the amount and will probably still require the "client" to register and submit some personal information, ID copy...
For the simple reason as if any of your clients pay you 1000$ with VISA/MC then you receive that 1000$ in BTC. A day latter (even a month and half latter) that client can contact VISA/MC and report this transaction as fraud, BTC does not permit to cancel a already confirm transaction so the middle man in this story is a big loser. These two method of payment are not easily compatible. Its the same with Paypal, where the client is king and most dispute end-up to be automatic loss for the merchand.
I imagine in a near future other crypto will tackle this issues, OmiseGo  seams to work in that direction.

But at the end of the day, it does not look like 2-3 fork will get to kill bitcoin. And you know what we say, what does not kill you make you stronger.  (And in this case, richer)
So I really hope bitcoin community get is shit together, I don't think its really sustainable to have 2 fork a years.
Hopefully some protection agains forking will be great.

Most thief want the money right away for drugs or at least in a way that is non traceable, by now we all know that bitcoin is not anonyme... If you get rub by gun point, most of waller have a 2FA confirmation or even more, and then you can go to the police and they will be able to trace it back. You rubber have to be good to really exchange it back to monero or a other more anonyme crypto... But then chance are police will find the exchanger he use, and since they all require id verification... He is fuck...
It's quit the same as trying to rub someone and ask him to go do a bank transfer !

Bitfinex don't allow you to do deposit true USD,
and Coinbase (or GDAX, same) allow you only to place basic limit order. Bitfinex allow you much more control on your order. If you have some coding skills you can also fairly easily code or adapt existing code to control your investment.
Like chri8015 mention on top, when you place order on exchanger, it froze the amount of money require for that order. But if you have the tendency to place really optimistic order, then it may freeze a lot of your money for order that will not go true. Bitfinex (and fews other exchanger) allow you remote control, so you can imagine genius way to maximize your money by making script that will actually place your order in the book only when the price will be realistically close to your order. (That will also have the advantage to lower your fees for not having to paid the trader fees but only the maker ;) )

Yeah, as much as I trust gold to be a save commodity, I'm sure it's a amazing safe investment if you are planning for the end mankind... I don't see much future as a speculative commodity, the price of gold bean lower than is 2011 and 2012 prices... It rise in price at a steady pace but really not fast enough... And there all the trouble with all that paper gold that bean print... (We have to thanks JP Morgan for that to, and all other major player) At the end of the day, what will definitely help the price of gold will be a other market crash, but to that, if ppl want to get there gold (physically) they will soon realize that 2/3 of all gold sold exist only on paper... There is not even enough money in circulation in the world to buy back all that paper gold at current price.
Also the gold price is also extremely manipulated, by one hand by the big firm (like JP Morgan) that sell you paper gold print out of fine air, and in the other hand by the mining company, that make sure to mine  small quantity of gold, enough to paid there operation and give a bit of dividend to there share holder. The price of gold is to low right now for them to go full on mining. Also a lot of mining company dont report when they found new source of gold. Fews mine bean discover and then shut down, because if the real quantity of gold still available for mining was to be know. It will crash the price.
After all that, I definitely want fews once of gold for the kick of having it in your safe and as parachute money, but I'll not considerer it as a investment...

Witch crypto are you following/planning on investing in ?
I personally love OMG for his day2day volatility, great for day trading.
For more long, I believe right now LTC is really undervalued, I bet that more we will get close to the fork, more LTC may get higher as it's will be more stable, up to 2-3 day before a future fork where everyone will buy in BTC to get the new coins...1 man opinion.

I'm fairely confident a fews use renewable energy since in many location is now the cheapest source of energy. But to invest in renewable energy for a mining company, that I'm not sure its the best choice, as most will likely just reinvest all they can in increasing there hash power.
When you think about it, the electricity price is bound to get cheaper and cheaper with time as crypto will "hopefully" increase in value with time. So in my mind your are better investing much more of your capital in hash power instead of electricity production.

I guess it depend mostly of where in the world you are (or at least in witch fiat you have your capital or your income) to avoid losing money on the exchange rate. Then it also depend the funding method you will like to use, credit card, bank draft, bank transfert, ...
Coinbase have a lot of critic, its also the most widely adopted so its also normal to have more bad comments than other less use service. At the end if you are not ready to trust them with your money you can also just use them to buy small amount and transfert all your coin in a cold storage or a other website of your choice depending your investment strategy.

For sure bitcoin exchanger and other crypto service could do the same, and in some sort of way they are all doing it, to a small extande. In the case of the Bitcoin do, chance are a situation like that wont stay stable, as anyone can easily see how much money there is on each adresse, therefore you can audit much easier exchanger and other service to control the amout of Bitcoin they actually own.
Let say tomorrow, your best exchanger decide to liquidate a 1000 BTC, and cash in the money. That will be sean by a lot of person since the ledger is public and it's not so hard to trace back the owner of a specific wallet.
In the case of the paper gold, there is no ledger keeping a general record of everything that bean sold. Estimated put it at 2/3 of all gold   sold around the world exist only on paper... In this case it's mostly only the financial institution (like our beloved JP Morgan) that know, how much they sold fake gold, and there is not much incentive to report it...
@_date: 2017-09-16 02:13:26
Simple, take the website of your choice to buy your BTC but once the transaction go true, you then open a account on a exchanger, you then send your BTC on that exchanger, then on those you can trade as you want, if you want to you can sell and buy 20 time in the same day or more, sky is the limit. Many of the biggest exchanger will not allow you to deposit your gain in your bank account, at that point you send back those BTC to the website of your choice to cash your gain.
Also look at the price of each website and exchanger. You can often find website that sell bitcoin for cheaper than other website and vice-versa you can find website that will sell them for more money than other website. It's good habit to open a account on MANY different website for those reason, you can then buy at the cheapest website, trade them on the exchanger of your choice and then when you want to cash in you send them to the website that sell them for the most $ (just take in your math the fees) that is the basic of arbitrage trading.

Ok then, yes a country can ban bitcoin unilaterally, will it stop its use, no, but it will make it much less useful for the citizen of that country.
Cause even if well motivated trader transfer there BTC to oversea exchanger, if they can't touch that money back in there country. It will limit the amount of ppl that will really invest in something that they will not legally be able to use in there country. Its fine if they plan to leave there country but if they are confident that there country will never allow normal use of BTC then it does lose a lot of value. As much profitable Bitcoin can be, its not the only profitable investment option, so if the headache of trading it get to intense for one specific population you could for sure see a decrease in volume from that same population. 
A bit like making alcohol or weed illegal never stop its use, but it definitely decrease the volume of consumption ! Since alcohol is legalize in USA consumption increase. Same is happening with cannabis legalization.

I agree with you, its to easy to trade thinking about counting the profits in fiat. Its better to keep the amount of coin increasing, I do that but I often try to take my profits and put them in other altcoins to diversify. I actually made myself a trading bot to control a portion of my investment, some like bitcoin are better investment good to hold, but other alt are really good for short term investment since there volatility let them jump 10-20% on a day or weekly base, and often come back to low price on these same period. So I try to keep the same amount of bitcoin in stock while gently trading it, and increasing my hold on altcoin and trade these last much more intensely for there hight volatility.

1) Of course it's not easy, we also all know that risk is much higher than forex and others. I try not to make any predictions on bottom and top. At the end of the day, any actions you do is a bit of a bet. There is never one single person that can predict the price. My point was that if you inform yourself, and you imagine that most trader do, most have access to the same information so you can imagine that most will react the same way.
2) I'm not in US, then for me if I follow my country of residence income is income, as any income that I add in my tax report will be tax the same. But a smarter man can also open a bank on some overseas territory (Virgin island, Bahamas, Turks &amp; Caicos and Bermuda) have some great tax agreement with many country and great tax rate :)
3) I have different investment strategy, long term are on cold wallet, then i keep my short term on exchanger and if I sell off I'll keep the money on the exchanger to be ready to buy back in. I do try to avoid as much as possible to transfert money back and forward to my bank account to avoid all those fees and wait time.
I did not wanted to sound a smartass for my previous comments, my point was that I often see when a massive trend take form, that trend stay for a fews hours, specially in the morning the time that many woke up around the US especially and asses the situation.

Its still depend of the use you imagine for bitcoin, it's not sure bitcoin will ever be fit to scale to such a mass adoption. And so far bitcoin have proven that big change is hard to get a consensus. For the simple reason that to many see advantage of forking the coin each time they have a occasion for...
By the time bitcoin will have updated there system to scale to the entire population, how many time will it have fork ?
There is definitely other promising crypto, that could scale for real day to day use for the entire population much easier. We also start to see coin that are not forkable. That to is really promising.

That it, you are actually almost never really buying gold, exception of gouv. and company that actually need the physical gold to make real product out of it. 2/3 of all gold sold )and almost all investment gold) exist under the form of paper gold. It's printed gold that never exist and will not. (What they call ETF in the article) They are starting to do the same with Bitcoin as well.
In the case of the Gold is way worst since they even charge you a storage fees when you buy it, problem is, they sold you gold that they don't have and will never have, and still charging you storage fees. Many big institution like Chase bean sues for that ! (Always bean resolve before court). Almost all website will NOT send you the gold.

You know, the other way to solve it if you don't want to wait on coinbase or can't wait, is to contact your bank and report those transaction as fraud !
If on your Coinbase account it show clearly that you just bought for 1 transaction and they did charge you 4 time, take a good print screen of your coinbase transaction page in case the bank need a proof (and to make sure Coinbase don't add 3 more transaction to your account and pitch YOU under the buss).
If you go down this road, I'll suggest you move your current BTC balance (and any other coins you have on CB) somewhere else, usually merchant are not so kind when you call fraud on them (since it lower the quote with Visa/Mc (and then they pay higher % fees or loose there license)).
But that what should happen to any merchant that give bad customer care and do allow there system to do double transaction (quadruple transaction in this case)

Yeah there project don't seams to be finish, not much details on a fees structure or anything. Personally I was looking for something to be use locally (in Canada) and I'm probably missing something, I imagine that there is a banking law that prevent it. When you think about it, in Canada its only in recent years that we saw the apparition of the debit Visa/MC. Before Interact was having the monopoly and it was not possible to get a debit Visa... Canada always bean intense on there banking laws (it help in 2008).
About traveling do, there seams to be fews option for US use and EUR zone as well that are much less fees intensive (as far as you use that card only in the area that it cover). Most of those cards are quite cheap, and with something like 1$/monthly fees, its not terrible knowing that many visa will charge you a 100$/years fees... It's really when you start using it outside of the zone its made for that you are getting fuck !

Its monero mining ? Even if it say bitcoin in the name, they ask for a XMR wallet and payment at 0.2 XMR.
Then, how different from coin-hive.com ? CH payout at 0.5XMR but Brominer dont say the amount pay by hashe/s and does not mention there commission... Just seams to be a layer (middle man) site of coin-hive... till proof of contrary...
EDIT: Quick look at the source code confirm me that this site is a layer of coin-hive.

And even a trader trade with USD will not buy any alt coin at current price if BTC is down fews %, knowing that BTC bounce back usually before the alt coins. Other traders that have open position on alt coin, want to close them to have some liquidity to buy the dip of BTC making the entire cryptosphere dip all together :) Buy the dip ;)

You speak french ? A tu réellement lut l'article au complet, car ton analyse de cette articles me fait pensée que tu n'a pas lut cette article, ou simplement les mots que tu voulais...
(Sorry for the non-bilingual, I was just saying how off this recap of the article was)
Basically in this articles, they ask about 4-5 professional theres opinion and 4 on 5 say crypto is a better investment.
I'll try to give you a quick recap:
First, Tom Lee from Fundstrat is saying BTC should be in btw 20K to 55K USD in 2022.
Second paragraph is saying that the enthusiast for bitcoin is equal as the unenthusiast for the gold, stating the gold jump this year from  1150 to close to 1350 USD. They finish this paragraph with a open question "Is it a bubble ?". 
Third paragraph, Alexis Roussel, co-fonder and CEO of Bity is stating that a 55000$ target is realistic as this year it jump 500% (with the hight of 5000$) and 2000% in 2 years.
4&amp;5 paragraph, is asking if bitcoin in the alternative to fiat can concurrence with gold, since both are in limited number [personal note: I guess they don't know about paper gold...] at the contrary of fiat, Stefan Kremeth (funder of Incrementum (gold fund)), is stating that its absolutely not the same as "gold is tangible and crypto is not", also saying that even if bitcoin is limited in number, the amount of new ICO increase the volume. [But even this guy, that work for golf fund end by saying] although I believe the cryptocurrency will gain more value not because of there limited number but because this technology have infinite use.
6, other difference is that btc is not regulated, new law can affect is value, as gold will remain stable.
7, if investor company speak more about bitcoin than gold, is because its easter to invest in that first.
8, Andreas Ruhlmann from IG, online trader and remporter, is saying that she see more and more discussion on the subject, and she believe a lot of investor invest in it because they are afraid of missing the trend more than because of there understanding of the technology. She also say that it look like a bubble, it does't look like it's about to pop, but it look like the excitation of the dotcom.
9, Tom Lee saying the bitcoin is eating the gold cause it have a lot of similarity with this last and it could be the ultimate currency for storage of value.
10, Andreas Ruhlmann also saying that gold have lost a lot of is attraction from its investor, even its recent increase of 15% in value is actually because of  the value of fiat that is going down. She advise that we will not see big increase in value for the gold anytime soon, but small increase is possible because of political reason, North-Korea.
11, Stefan Kremeth and Dominique Casaï funder of URAM (gold fund), saying gold is a reserve of value as bitcoin is not since its not real and does not have 5000 years of history. It can replace fiat but will not replace gold. He is seeing a gain of interest for gold since 1 years and half.
12, saying that there is more and more ETF on gold sold than there is refund. Saying this show that ppl trust the gold more these current years contrary of 2013 to 2015 where the ETF in gold where going down. 
13, Alexis Roussel saying the ICO are on the rise.
14, sure but China just ban them ! We have to take a minute to understand that these policy are more a way to slow the amount of ICO rather than stop them as any policy on cryptocurrency are hard to apply, giving the example of China having ban bitcoin several time and its still in high use.
15, investing in bitcoin require knowledge and bitcoin bean the most valuable its not say that it will remain the case in 10 years.
16, Bitcoin market cap is 80 billion, a drop in the bucket of all investment, as gold is 2400 billion. A good strategy is to diversify your investment of non-inflation assets, gold, and different crypto currency.
Hope this help
Its really positive article ! 
And sorry for my bad english...

At the end of the day, the market is so volatil that it does not really matter. Some sold at 3K this morning, and if they are lucky enough they will be able to buy back lower over the weekend (at worst they can possibly wait for similar price at the end of October), some other have bought in at 3k today and if they sold it right now, they are already 20% up in profits (not to bad in fews hours) and if they wait Monday they will be probably much more profitable. 
My point is, there is so much movement in the market that as far as you dont panic and get stupid you can easily make amazingly good trade no matter the direction you are trading !

There should be 30 years left to the "One contry, Two system".
Not sure China will respect that... They already did a lot to bring Hong-Kong under there control. And I don't think China have any intention to convince Taiwan... One day they will simply do what Russia did with Crimea...(They just have to grow some balls first) The commun mindset of most of Chinese is already that Taiwan is China. Every years China move toward that goal by removing Taiwan from more and more international organization...  
Actually China don't recognize Taiwan as a country, but as a China territory, therefore when a Taiwanese go to China, China don't recognize there passport and actually give them a Chinese passport...

There is more at work there tho. Most small island don't have there own currency or even if they do, they will end-up using the currency from a other country for the simple reason that they don't produce any goods (or almost none) and then when they import all the necessary they have to buy them from major supplier and ship delivery. These company don't accept bitcoin and therefore you have to convert your bitcoin in cash, it's not easy and you end-up having fees. There is also a geo-political aspect to it, many island since they are entirely depending on shipping container route for normal supply, are at the mercy of the gouvernement from the provider country and in many case that gouvernement abuse of his power to impose the laws that they want on theses small islands !
You can see that with the US imposing laws on Bahamas and other small island.

Competition is a good thing, without better and better alt coin, bitcoin will not have technically evolve much. Now that a lot of altcoin are also aiming to be use as currency it push the developpement of bitcoin. Altcoin is a really large term that for some include all other coins except bitcoin... To that definition I can understand that a lot of ppl are sceptic on altcoin, I'm personally not a fan of ICO as for many its almost like flipping a dice. No matter how good the white paper sound, its almost exactly like penny stock, its great for volatility but its often way to early in the developpement of the project to really invest huge amount and be able to "predict" the evolution. I like better small altcoin that are already listed in fews exchanges and have proof some stability, some base line price and have already show some result in there developpement/marketing/adoption...
Then again we are all different and if we where to have all the same investment strategy, none of us will make money !

Its probably more close to mass adoption that you can see, I mean in term of who know about bitcoin, I work in service industry and often talk about it with a lot of persons and we are now at the point that many have hear good things about it. Many know other that have invest in it. Then just to be the 4 or 5 person to mention the potential to them and they will try it out by themself. Probably put a 10$ or a 100$ and a couple months down the road when they will have already saw the potential and read more about it, they will invest more. There is not just reddit in life, the main way of advertisement is definitely the mouth to mouth. And its also the most efficient way. In a time where we all know you can't trust a adds online that tell you how to get rich, and we can't trust a know banker to tell you what to do with your money. Ppl actually give much more credit to stranger they talk to in person or contacts and friends !
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:22:11
Can you be more clear ?
Witch platform you try ?
Too many wait the big dip to start registration and try to buy. Unfortunately most website that sale online will do strict verification of your ID and bitcoin website are know for poor customer service... You can easily wait 1w+ for verification (and this is if they accept all your file)
Take the habits of subscribe on many website (just remember to use 1 password/website ;) )
This way, the day the BTC drop to your dream price, you can buy from many source without any difficulty !

It's not so much of a prediction, just use to see the price falling on friday and rising back on monday. Even without any news its a normal tendency as many investor sell of on friday to simply not have to look at the market over the weekend (not have to work). Also the fact that there is less news coming out over the weekend and less volume over weekend usually bring the price lower, then on Monday many buy back to start the week.

Yeah, as much as I trust gold to be a save commodity, I'm sure it's a amazing safe investment if you are planning for the end mankind... I don't see much future as a speculative commodity, the price of gold bean lower than is 2011 and 2012 prices... It rise in price at a steady pace but really not fast enough... And there all the trouble with all that paper gold that bean print... (We have to thanks JP Morgan for that to, and all other major player) At the end of the day, what will definitely help the price of gold will be a other market crash, but to that, if ppl want to get there gold (physically) they will soon realize that 2/3 of all gold sold exist only on paper... There is not even enough money in circulation in the world to buy back all that paper gold at current price.
Also the gold price is also extremely manipulated, by one hand by the big firm (like JP Morgan) that sell you paper gold print out of fine air, and in the other hand by the mining company, that make sure to mine  small quantity of gold, enough to paid there operation and give a bit of dividend to there share holder. The price of gold is to low right now for them to go full on mining. Also a lot of mining company dont report when they found new source of gold. Fews mine bean discover and then shut down, because if the real quantity of gold still available for mining was to be know. It will crash the price.
After all that, I definitely want fews once of gold for the kick of having it in your safe and as parachute money, but I'll not considerer it as a investment...

There is definitely some timing that you can apply, specially if you want to actively trade it and not simply hold it.
If you want to simply invest for the long run, you are better to start small when you see the price bouncing up 10%-15% knowing that chance are that in a month or two you will get better deal. You can definitely see pattern over a day, over a week or longer period. 
There is also a bunch of ppl that are just not risk taker and will never jump in the boat. Same as some will buy bitcoin at a X price and when its up 50% will still not sale it but when there investment will be down 10% from the price they pay, they will panic sale ! As anything, if you want to make money out of it you have to give it some time, read news, keep inform.

I'm not counting on any special/fancy strategy, I do some holding already, and I'll like to try with a smaller amount on high volatility crypto simply trading. You set a large amount of preset order on a SQL (or other language), then you make a script that compare your preset buying value to the ticket price, if your buying value is in a range of 1% the ticket, you place the order (this way you avoid the trader fees). Then if bought, the same script compare the preset sell value to the ticket and if ticket &gt; preset, you place your sell order.
I'm planning on making a preset (or more) for each small price decimal. It seams more logical to have a plenty of small order at different entree price and % of profits to sell different.
Of course the limitation of this script is that it does absolutely not forecast thing, so if the assets go up really fast, your script will still sale at preset % and than re buying the same quantity will be more expensive. Also it does not predict drop and so easily a lot of your money can get catch to buy the falling asset. The only control is then the preset that are mostly add manually, meaning that if the asset sky rock, the script will go buy it as far as the preset price you enter.

You don't have to run a full node to get the 2 coins, simply have them in cold storage, meaning that you own the private key (not like Coinbase or exchanger)
Usually most will not sell before the fork, cause them you will for sure not get that second coin.
You can also look at the previous fork (bitcoin cash) and see how each platform handle-it. (For example Coinbase did not give the bitcoin cash, so if you want the 2 coins don't keep them there)
I personally like to trade, so except my cold storage, some of my coin will remain with bitfinex since they did well explain how they will handle the fork and I believe they will follow there announcement.

Surviving on Bitcoin in the sens of only payment method is definitely possible if you can do the same in your life with a CC, you can also redraw fiat from your BTC wallet in many country now with BTC ATM or with a BTC wallet link to a CC.
Then can you get your income in BTC, this is still not yet massively implemented, will be good to see a company like ADP offering to send you your paycheck directly in BTC. But small business around the world its getting slowly adopted, ask by employee, offer by employer in some area. (Found some coffee shop, artist style, where all employee where paid in BTC :) )
Or for other, Traders, the question is can they survive from there BTC investment, while paying everything with BTC. Then its a question of how much can you generate in profits in a timeframe VS how much your life cost you for that timeframe.

there is a level of risk in anything, like you can get your credit card robe or identity thief and so on and so one. The idea is to do your due diligence, increase the level of security on your account or select exchange with adequate level of security and that you believe trust worthy. Also not necessarily put all your eggs in the same basket, eventually using different exchanger and more than a account by exchanger.

Ok I'm not to sure about the best website for EU, the best advise I can give you is to open several account on each website you can buy, and than look at the price they usually sell and there fees. Calculate both together and compare them to each other.
You can use  yo help you out (fees not include)
The price of BTC can be very different from one exchange to a other. Some exchange cater much more to holder investor and some other cater more for day trader. That create some disparity in price often, (what we call arbitrage). Also look at the time it take to fund your account or transfer the fund. I recently try a new platform that look really good with ok price and cheap fees for funding, but once I was in possession of my BTC, I needed to wait for over a week to transfer them to a other exchanger. Since I was planning to use these BTC for day trading. For that reason it was definitely not a good move since I basically lose the % of profits I usually do in a day * the amount of day. I will have bean better buying on a platform that will have charge me a bit higher fees but will have give me my coin in the next fews minutes...
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:12:41
Totally agree, still chance are by that time a more convenient currency will be use on a day to day base and bitcoin maybe relegated to bigger value storage... Bitcoin still have fews scalability issues that are far from over.

Credit card will normally refund you if they can prove its a theft or a clone card. But its not always that easy, for some customer they don't get there money back, or because the purchase look too "normal" for the credit card company or because they don't believe the customer or because the customer toke to long to report it...
Then to answer your question, I'll say no any website or material stuff is 100% safe from hacker or thief (just go watch Ocean 11 ;) ). Like said earlier then its more a trust relation. But some exchanger allow you a lot of settings to prevent that. I like bitfinex for the way it handle withdraw, it ask for a SMS code, then a email confirmation, then you can also set specific crypto to allow withdraw (or none) and it will take 5 days just to change theses settings, and they notify you at each login. At that point if someone is accessing your account in the purpose of getting there money, they will have a hard time. But still they can still loose THERE money if someone put there hands on there cold storage private key... Like I said nothing is 100%, its all about risk management !

No I think a lot of ppl agree that the actual situation is mostly a political move and a temporary situation the time to come out with some legislation to control the craziness and to reduce the fraud case. Other country already did put some law in place to control the BTC exchange of there country. No control is as bad as to much.
But I still don't agree that by banning something it automatically get more valuable... The opposite if it was more widely adopte by china, that will certainly make it even more valuable. (Just for the purpose of this argument, lets suppose China is coming out with the option to paid Crude Oil exporter in BTC, the volume trade of BTC will increase significantly, since the amount available is limited price will sky rock.)

@_date: 2017-10-14 21:46:45
I'll advise against, but it all come down to math right ?
So what is your plan, buying BTC to Hold or to Trade ?
At witch % can you borrow ? How long you can pay the payment without having to start deduct from your BTC ?
How long you bean following BTC ? You can see from the past that 2 months under the ATH is recurrent. Even we saw time where the price was more than 1 years under its ATH. I believe that if you borrow to invest in BTC you have to be prepare for the worst, by that I mean that your monthly income should at least be able to cover your monthly payment and your expense. Cause if you count on starting selling your BTC to cover your premium, you may be selling them at half price if a big drop happen !
@_date: 2017-10-14 23:57:07
Warren B. never sold his bitcoin cause yes its a new investment and we can all see that its just the beginning of the train and we are not even at mass adoption yet, so it will gladly go much higher. But that doesn't mean it will ALWAYS go up. And yes if you look at it on a infinite timeframe, it may even always go up. Look at almost any stock from 2008, almost all stock are now valued the double than there 2008 price (or even price before crash). That good if you are able to sit on your investment for infinite amount of time, yes it will value more than when you bought it. If you can sell when you believe its over-valued, buy again when its under-valued and do the same a fews time, you will increase the amount of coin you have your hold on without even have to invest more. When I say SELL, it does't mean walking away from the bitcoin world, but just to sell to retake position at a lower price.
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:19:41
Yes it make perfect sense in that situation (meaning you can afford your monthly payment without touching the BTC). On the other hand you can also probably look for bitcoin investment fund for your 401k to not have to borrow, specially if you are not planning on trading. I'll suggest that you put yourself a target price where you plan to sell. Not selling all your bitcoin, but you could target a % that allow you to pay off what you borrow and the remaining bitcoin are free. I strongly believe bitcoin have still many good years ahead, and I'm sure blockchain technology and crypto are here to stay, but no-one saw the fall of Yahoo or Nortel coming 15 years ago, we still certainly use search engine and telephone nowaday, just not from those specific brand. That why I'm always a bit more reluctant in putting all my eggs in the same basket and that why I personally like more short term or at least I write down my objective and I follow them true. Of course sometime I'll sell and the price will continue to rise, but to many time ppl will not sell hopping for the price to continue to rise and they end-up with less or at least less that what there first objective was.
@_date: 2017-10-14 16:49:42
At this point, I believe there is just no way to solve the issue without paying 5% fees or more OR lying on your adresse... (And you expose yourself to hight fees anyway if its for use inside Canada...) 
In the pass I was planning to use CEX.io to transfer back some money on my CC but since they have a recently terrible reputation and they smell fishy... I'll continue to mainly hold my BTC and use them only where BTC payment is available !

I still believe we are 5-7 years from a real mass adoption. It also really depend which city you are living in. But having bean living for a fews years in different island of the caribbean, I can tell you that even credit card is not so useful in many place. I don't see bitcoin getting a acceptance rate higher than fiat anytime soon. Bitcoin is good in young and modern city, but where there is no competition, bitcoin have a hard time to get adopted. I'll love to be able to spend only BTC, but it's really not everywhere that do accept it. Debit CC card do charge amazing fees % (specially in country that are not supported like Canada :( ) and the volatility is not always in your favor. I'll gladly go out and pay fews things with bitcoin this week and hopefully next week, but a month and half ago when it was at 3K (when you know that its wroth more) its painful. That why in some regard I agree that its more a assets than a currency for now at least !
@_date: 2017-10-15 01:09:47
Yeah and no way to use them aswell !
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:08:27
It strongly depend of WHERE (witch country) you will use it for and how you are planning on using it.
There is country (like for me Canada) where it is just absolutely not useful as no provider will deliver in Canada, and will charge you higher fees if you are using it.
Look closely at each card fees structure. Many will charge you a deposit % fees (normally between 0.5 - 1%) + sometime a monthly fees (normally really low), some will charge you a ATM withdraw fees (+ the actual ATM fees), + 2-5% conversion fees if you are using it for purchase in a different currency that the card it self, + some will even charge you a POS % fees (meaning all your purchase will be subject to that % of fees (that fees can even be higher if you are not in the country where the card apply)). And then some will keep your balance in BTC some will keep your balance in the currency of the card.
It really depend on where you live in the world and the fees structure of that card. Read carefully the fees structure!
