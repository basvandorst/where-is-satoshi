That only functions while bitcoin ISN'T the dominant currency. 
If it ever became the dominant currency, why would you want people to sit there an 'Hodl' it? The economy would crumble around everyone.

The perspective I got is that this guy is wrong and it IS an investment he managed insanely poorly because he was more worried about the principle of it.

Not really, Bitcoin is bought with fiat. 
If people hit any sort of economic uncertainty or struggles or anything, their first response is not going to be investing in a super speculative volatile investment. 
Like people forget that something like gold is fine to hold when stuff is absolutely collapsing around you, but it also lowers the value of gold. When everything is going to hell, the value of everything drops because no one has any disposable money.
Bitcoin still isn't in any position to actually become a viable currency existing in a day to day economy, it's years and years away from that state, maybe decades. So a negative shock to the US Dollar will only crash crypto prices too in the state its in.
That all being said, this 'government shutdown' stuff actually poses no risk to fiat Everyone knows this is all political gamesmanship and has no impact on American credit worthiness. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:06:09
I dunno, give me any sort of equation or reason it's at any price?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:25:08
It wouldn't fix governments using it though. If Crypto does become the main currency, governments would just do the same thing using crypto

@_date: 2018-01-17 02:21:16
That's not the meaning of the term in that context. 
If you do work, that incurs a debt, if someone eats at your restaurant, they've incurred a debt. 
If a store offers something for sale, buying it incurs a debt and it must be available for the dollar. However you don't have to offer something for sale.
It's a broader meaning than most people would think of as a 'debt' 
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:21:20
The primary reason they can't is because of how the security is designed. Most people will never, ever be able to handle the individual security and protection of passwords and keys required. It's just not something they're capable of. 
Also, it's incredibly hard to own as an institution. Again, the security, division of keys and ownership of currency is way too hard to manage and vulnerable. 
Crypto's main benefit...that it's decentral and can never be reversed, is also its biggest weakness.
Things are hacked, people are defrauded, mistakes are made. People benefit from the current ability to have accounts corrected and money refunded and a world without those safeguards is very dangerous. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:59:52
Everyone keeps doing that, it's moronic. They're intentionally excluding 'digital' versions of Fiat currencies when Bitcoin is 100% digital.

I think you're more confused than you think.
ETFs don't have 'Maturity Date' 
ETFs and Futures aren't the same thing
Futures have a settlement date, usually the last Friday of the month. 
So the First Bitcoin Futures issued will expire Jan 26th. 
Also all the bitcoin contracts don't settle in Bitcoin, they're just Cash Settled, you get the difference in USD. There's no sellout or whatever
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:43:28
So go protest or something. Don't invest in one thing or another because of philosophical belief and pie in the sky stuff. 
Do it based on returns and benefits. Bitcoin and the like are good because they've risen in value and that's fun and earns money. But they're not a realistic replacement for currency. So get in on the hype and be ready when its finally over to let it go. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:03:14
I agree there can be massive advancements. But that's more an argument for making a new crypto with those features already existing. 
The issue with insurance vs actually being able to reverse payments is that any criminal never has the proceeds taken back. 
So it becomes super profitable to hack and defraud things because they have no recourse. 
Seems like like someone made a bare bones thing never thinking of these problems and now people are scrambling to patch those solutions on top of a woefully insufficient technology.

@_date: 2018-01-21 06:31:24
I guess i just don't find that's true. 
What person honestly has wealth sitting in US Dollars? 
Anyone poor or middle class doesn't have large cash assets.
And Anyone upper class, high income isn't sitting with their wealth in Dollars. Everyone is going to invest it into other assets of some kind.
I keep wondering who is this tiny weird group of people with bank accounts just sitting with millions in Cash USD that loses their value to inflation?
I think you much more need Bitcoin to actually stand up and do something functionally useful. Right now it's can't be used for credit, it can't seriously be owned by institutions, it can't have transactions reversed or corrected, it can't be sent in small or frequent amounts, it can't be handled by low-tech or low-security people, it's overly centralized into Chinese miners, it's innately deflationary etc... etc.. there's a lot of problems with it. 
I think Bitcoin and the like have to become at least viable alternatives before anyone is going to look at it as a possibility to replace anything.
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:21:34

Probably less to protect the price than to take servers or mining offline or something. Maybe kill a nationally supported fork. 
Bitcoin's never going to become a currency, so it's kind of moot, but if it did, things like that seem plausible.

Don't know why you'd think the highway here only means 'on chain'?
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:32:52
I guess in my mind that is fairly predictable, a mean of 5% with variation a few % on either side. 
Also, you seem to link to some 2nd made up inflation number, the actual CPI number is lower. 
I guess the part I really don't get though is... exactly how does this hurt 'working class' people? 
Working Class people do not have cash sitting in accounts. Many people live pay cheque to pay cheque, and I'd think less than 1 in 20 people making under $75,000 a year have $5,000 in cash in any account they own.
So I don't understand this, how does this harm poor people? If you don't have large amounts of cash, what difference does inflation make?
Inflation is designed to make sure wealthy people can't hold their assets in cash and maintain their power, it forces them to invest it into capital and other investments. 
If you're poor...it's a 50% loss of value to...what? What poor person holds cash for 15 years?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:50:05
Yeah, small payments aren't reversed because they've got 2 victims, the client and the vendor, so those payments are insured.
Larger payments, wires, money transfers etc... are reversed. 
The larger amounts are the concern, basically every bitcoin exchange ever has been hacked for millions of dollars. 
If the Bank of America was 'hacked' one day, everything would just be reversed. When trades are entered fraudulently, they're reversed. 
The ability to do that is pretty important. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:54:01

@_date: 2018-01-17 15:42:28
Yeah. And?
@_date: 2018-01-21 09:44:06
I think honestly we shouldn't make any attempt to control 'spam' at all.
The future state solution must be able to deal with 1000x this current volume. If the system cannot tolerate the 'spam' it will never be able to handle people actually using BTC to purchase goods and services. 
It'd be like trying to redesign a highway so that less cars can get on it. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:32:57
Seems like it's not a reality-based way of viewing it. 
Also you're not describing 'having a little extra to play with' you're saying you want either enough money to live your whole life, or nothing. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 17:24:10
That just seems like a very All-or-Nothing approach to it. 
If you can't make so much money that you can live your whole life on it, then you'll just let it sit there? There's got to be some point where you'd take some profits, or some point you'd salvage if it deteriorates to nothing?
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:28:49
I can't even begin to agree with that. There's both just currencies, they don't have any ethics. Both can be used for good things or bad things. 
But the US Dollar is subject to a massive anti-money laundering system while crypto is not. 
But those systems are set up by governments, it's not a function of the currency itself.

You seem to think of 'backing' as saying you guarantee you'll exchange it for something else. 
But I'm saying its backed by them guaranteeing they will accept it in exchange for something that has some utility. 
Certain things must be paid for in US dollars, there's no other option. The dollar is backed by those things.

Are you impugning the good name of the 'Moneygrabber Corporation'?
@_date: 2018-01-21 10:19:38
I mean the current capacity of the blockchain is like 7 transactions per second or something. We need it to do like 100,000 per second at some point eventually.
Imagine you had a highway that could handle 700 cars per hour, and you expected the population of your city to rise by 10000% in the next 5 years.
You wouldn't say your problem could be fixed by keeping unnecessary cars off the highway. Your problem is that you clearly need to redesign your highway to be way way way better.
What i'm saying is the current amount of Transactions we're calling 'Spam' is a volume that's maybe 0.01% of the volume we need Bitcoin to be able to handle 5 or 10 years from now. 
Eliminating the 'Spam' accomplishes nothing, because legitimate transactions in a few years will dwarf the amount of spam there is currently.

Now you just walked back you previous comment and admit it was intended to be a currency. 
Yes, we'll "give it some time" Like 10+ years. It's Not ready now, My entire point which you said was wrong was that it has gigantic problems. You said it didn't, and you've just backpeddled harder than I've ever seen anyone ever do.

No, I meant like the directly government owned land and assets. 
You could include things like tax collected on property taxes, but those tend not to be Federal, so it's part of that system, but I wouldn't tend to consider that as backing the currency, you could argue taxes on privately owned land are more of a backing to the municipal and state bond structure though.

Wouldn't be any different than any other Pay-to-Win Asian Style MMO, I don't think itt being Bitcoin or Dollars or 'Gems' or anything really makes any difference, its the same thing
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:44:31
But then tell someone to convert their Bitcoin then send it in Dollars, or take the bitcoin, then you convert it to dollars.
Like If I told you you can buy something from me in Yen, then every minute the price keeps changing because the yen changes, I'm not really letting you buy it in Yen in the first place.
With most FX, you peg a rate and once you've hit buy, that rate is locked in. Having a floating rate because the currency is so volatile that even after the sale you can change the rate is just too difficult.
They should accept the amount in the bitcoin form with a stated bitcoin amount, then convert it and give the donation in whatever dollar amount it is. Trying to peg the dollar amount and work backwards is never going to work well. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 08:21:50
If there's a limited number, then the prices are higher and paying to win just costs more. 
You're just describing how a lot of MMOs currently work already. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:25:33
Yeah, but I'm saying that already exists anyway, just in normal currencies, so what different does the crypto make?
It tends to just make for a bad game because it's a completely pay to win MMO.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:08:25
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:45:20
But if you have little wealth or savings, you also shouldn't care about inflation...because you're not holding currency. 
If you see no problems with bitcoin, your head is so far in the sand it's not worth discussing. 
Also this 'top 20 currency' thing is the most ridiculous nonsense thing people keep repeating. 
I own the shit out of it. But think rationally about it's value, it's something that needs to be massively, massively fixed over a long long time. it's not something ready to be a currency replacement and it does NOT have ANY properties gold has.  
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:08:04
Yeah, as opposed to a more accurate use in terms of finance or economics or something. 
This place suffers from a lot of "Well, MY understanding is..." Yeah, we get it, you don't have an understanding. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:20:24
Luckily nowhere in the entire article does it say anything about 1.3 BTC limit. 
@_date: 2019-07-08 20:39:49
Yeah, but it's not like you send Tether money. 
Well, we know for a fact it's not actually 1:1, but is like 1:0.75 or something, which isn't too bad, but it's not 1:1
The most common 'creation' of Tether is just from you selling your existing assets. 
Say someone transfers in $100k worth of Ethereum to Bitfinex and sells it, they've now 'created' 100kUSDT
They then spend that money to buy BTC instead, and the BTC seller now holds the newly created USDT
Now in theory then it's Bitfinex or whatever other exchange then transferring USD they theoretically hold to Tether's secret hidden fiat accounts, but we can't see that happen and it's not like people actually individually doing that. 
Presumably they're doing that like banks do with net settlement payments periodically, or just doing it on a ledger with them.
@_date: 2018-01-21 08:02:49
Gold is used in technology, medical equipment and as a chemical catalyst, it's a more expensive substitute for Platinum and Palladium. 
So it has a floor value backed by industry. Nothing can say it must stay at $1330, but you can say it could never go below a few hundred dollars. Even if there was a world War 3 or a complete collapse of markets, it's use as a metal with unique properties holds a functional value.
And this whole thread is about Bitcoin replacing Fiat currency as a currency. You moving the goalposts is just you having your own off-topic discussion. Go make some other thread for that if you want.
I understand the tech, and like the early internet it's in the most infant like stage. It's not anywhere near ready yet. It's a baby, and it has huge tech issues and you being intentionally ignorant won't help it grow.
See the flaws, help address them. Don't be blind on purpose because you invest in it, let the fact you invest in it make you hyper aware of its problems. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:06:41
How'd they miss it?
I'm not sure they're interested in doing that, but they could do it. The Federal Reserve could simply decide the US Dollar itself now operates on a blockchain or a distributed network of some kind. 
There's nothing about the technology they couldn't implement themselves.
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:25:01
Of course they do, the primary reason the US dollar has any value is because you need US Dollars to pay US taxes. So it's tax stream is one of the primary consumption methods.
It's resources are probably the  consumption, as many key resources throughout the world trade primarily in the dollar. Notably the Petro-dollar trades are a huge prop to the US Dollar.
Lastly, it's lands and the royalties and taxes on those lands are another major consumer of the US Dollar.
So I'd say all three of those things massively back the value of the currency.   
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:40:59
In a childish way, yes it's almost exactly what you describe. 
You can invade the other countries and take their infrastructure and resources, you can eliminate their currency. 
Not like this is unprecedented, Iraq was invaded, their currency replaced. 
But backed by the military also largely means defensively. The physical space of the United States is worth a lot of money, and it can't be invaded or taken with the military intact. 
You can also only buy those assets by exchanging dollars for them, so as long as you can enforce that the assets can't be stolen, and that sales and taxes on those assets are USD, you've guaranteed a value. 
People have to be compelled to use currencies. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:43:27
That's childishly stupid. 
They don't 'fear' it or 'don't understand' it. It's super simple as a concept.
They're either interested in it or not interested in it. 
It's not an 'economic revolution' it's a fun toy someone made we can all make money on playing with until it breaks. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:31:41
People seem to be upset by the inflation, I can't understand why. 
It's a slow, predictable inflation. You don't want someone getting rich in 1890 then just holding their assets in Cash and maintaining its purchasing power. Why would anyone want that to be how a currency works? 
You want people to invest it, the currency itself shouldn't be the investment you hold. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:17:21
It's literally the only point you made, which other one could I pick?

I don't think any are. 
Some are just going to develop their own instead.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:16:11
Exactly. 
A tax to incentivize you to either spend it or invest it. 
I don't get why people would want an economy where people just hold on to money as cash. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:31:47
Backed by Violence seems like a great argument, I think you just mean it's not a moral one or something. 
The reality is no, you can't make someone buy TrollCoins with a gun in any sustainable way because you exist in a bigger system with more power. They can use their violence more effectively to stop yours. 
Resources and land have more value, but you only own resources and land if they're physically defensible. 
And you don't need to simultaneously find buyers for all of anything. There's not enough buyers for almost anything if you sold all of that thing at once, but it's not the plan to sell it at once, its to gain revenue from it for centuries to come. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 02:58:17
Government shut downs don't impact military. 
But yes, of course, if the military and police forces and other institutions were non-functioning, nothing would force the use of the currency. 
There seems to be a lot of complaint of not having enough backing the most powerful currency to ever exist, but no issues with the fact literally nothing backs or compels the use of the digital alternatives. 
Why don't people need something to 'back' it then?
@_date: 2018-01-23 13:53:02

Tether being created doesn't require someone to 'wire Tether money'

But you're still talking about making money then, so what do you mean?
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:28:20
Oh c'mon, of course they 'understand' it. Maybe like the 70 year olds running it personally don't 'understand' it but anyone working in their infrastructure could replicate it.
It's literally been replicated or improved on 1000+ times by now. 
I can understand them not wanting to do it, and not making any effort to do it...but of course they could do it.

Well, Gold is 'Speculative'   
Lay people seem to thing speculative means 'risky' or 'unfounded' but it just means 'taking a position in market direction'   
So things like 1 year Tbills are not speculative, but something like Gold, Oil, any Stock etc.. is speculative. (unless you're like a oil producer hedging)
@_date: 2019-07-08 21:37:34
I think you're now somehow on the opposite side of the discussion now, lol.  
Yes it's quite possible they have even less than that, the AG discovered at least $850 Million missing. God knows how much of it really exists.   
But that's my point...you don't have people wiring money to Tether for this 1:1 creation of USDT it can be created a number of ways
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:35:20
I guess it's a perspective thing. 
When it was down like 7% of a day IOTA was up 40%, no one said "Looks like people are dumping for Iota"
Or "Looks like people are dumping for Stellar Lumens" 
If you look across alts compared to earlier today, doesn't it actually seem like people are actually depeleting alts more than leaving BTC? 
One side of that fork has created the appearance of a rivalry that most people aren't even aware of or participating in

I'm more pointing out that it's naive and stupid to think any company has a 'soul'

@_date: 2017-12-27 06:17:40
Well, those are kind of my point, Iota and Ripple are started by insiders, with support from Banks and tech companies... That's how it's going to happen if it happens.
These ethical concerns and methodology concerns people keep having are completely meaningless.

So does just buying less. 
Technically Buying a lump sum of $80,000 in BTC and $20,000 in USD lowers your variance.
If you average in 4 times, they're really just 4 independent trades each with the same variance. Buying lower in trade B doesn't mean you didn't lose just as much money from trade A
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:36:03
Well, it's completely different than any other currency. 
If you get paid in British Pounds, you get paid a fixed amount of Pounds. That doesn't adjust when pounds lose or gain vs the Dollar or Euro.
Same with buying things using Bitcoin...no place has an actual Bitcoin price. 
It's merely the USD price * the bitcoin conversion rate. That's again not how pricing in other currencies works. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:57:05
The supply debate is a complete and utter red herring.
It won't matter until there's almost complete adoption, at which point the lack of supply means it becomes deflationary by nature. That's totally irrelevant when we're experiencing 10,000% annual moves.
As for the currency being adopted, that's really the crux of it. Essentially Bitcoin's ONLY argument is 'We were first' 
All odds would dictate if a crypto does take over, it's going to be a more technologically advanced one that is more functional and has supporters from the beginning. 
Don't bet on the reality of this, or the actual world wide implementation...bet the hype as more people get involved and then jump and roll out of it long before this hits the reality point.

Don't measure BCH in nominal terms, measure it as a function of BTC.
It the days around it was issued, 1 BCH was worth about 0.25 of a BTC and it peaked about 0.35 Now it's worth about 0.12 of a BTC.  
So really it's more of a 'what rise?'

Poor people don't have money to protect from inflation, it's the rich that benefit from low inflation.
Poor people should want high inflation because it makes your debt worth less money. 
If you owe for your home or student loans or business or whatever you should hope for like 15% a year inflation, your debt will be eradicated.

I know you can't buy 'his' but who cares? 1,000,000 bitcoins traded today, you could have bought as many as he had just on today's trading volume, you don't need his specific ones.
I'd kind of assuming he doesn't really have anything 'else' like this has been a good idea, but it's not special relativity, it's not a perpetual motion machine, it's just like semi-clever. It's not like the work of a generational genius y'know.

Interesting as well. I'm not American.
But my point was a lot of people say 'You can use Bitcoin to buy...' whatever
But every time it's simply the company has a fixed USD price and the 'bitcoin price' is just the USD price + 10-20% converted into Bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:24:28
Rebalancing is fair enough, I do encourage that.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:09:48
That's about 10%.
You paid for the card and the card's transaction fee, and then the actual transfer of the bitcoin has the normal blockchain fee. It's about 66 cents on a beer that probably cost $6.50 USD equivalent? That's just over 10%. 
I think you're missing the point, your beer was NOT bought with Bitcoin, your beer was bought with fiat currency. 
YOU paid a fee for the company you bought a card from to convert your bitcoin into that currency and give it to the merchant. 
That you don't appear to know what the fee is...is amazing, but also a really good example of what you've repeating. 
Your ignorance of how this works is expensive.
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:46:23
Full identity stolen for a long time, you're more out of luck. But a credit card fraud, stolen wallet, fraudulent or erroneous transfer, you'll get your money back about 90%.
Something like the bank itself being hacked, you get you money back damn near 100%. 
What's the percentage of your Bitcoin being returned after a fraud or hack? 0ish%
If you just type a wrong account number in a bill payment or transfer, your bank can just fix it. What happens when you type the wrong address in a transfer? Or misplace a decimal, or miss a zero? 
Banks and stuff are much more forgiving to errors and crime, you don't just lose everything.

If it is ahead of time, yes. 
But if you take out a loan at 5% and inflation spikes after that, you're good. 
Think hyperinflationary countries in particular, while it does obviously destroy the economy, it does wipe out a lot of people's personal debt as well.
Also inflation after world war 2 helped essentially erase most of the government debt.
Inflation hurts holders of money and holders of debt, it helps users of money and users of debt

Are you just being dense on purpose? 
Formerly stable countries can become highly inflationary. 
If you had a normal mortgage in Venezuela with a locked in rate for say 5 years in 2014, you'd get to watch your 15% loan stand during what is now 600-700% inflation. 
In just 2016 you could have gotten a 9% loan fixed in Egypt that's now seeing a 26% inflation. 
Similar in Argentina as well
These aren't super wealthy countries, but they're not poor countries either. They're modern industrialized countries with banking institutions offering fixed lending. 
If you had a business loan there or a mortgage or whatever and this higher inflation hits, it just means the value of your debt has dropped.

@_date: 2017-12-08 20:31:10
Yeah, but that's a threat to every stock, every asset class. 
If the supply exceeds demand, prices drop, if demand exceeds supply prices rise. 
However, for that specific concern, markets have traded $20,000,000,000 in the past 24 hours.

So just believe you, for you magically the entire concept of paying fees to send bitcoin doesn't exist? 
You can't show a transaction where that happened though? 
I think you either: 1) are transferring only from GDAX to GDAX or coinbase and there fore you're not actually transferring anything, it's all on paper. 
or 2) You're confusing GDAX itself not charging an additional fee with there being no fee on the blockchain.

There's 2 major things there though, one, almost everyone's email is stored by central 3rd parties who have control of it, could lock you out of it, can read it and archive it etc...That's exactly what we don't want.
But also email itself and all the programs have totally changed completely. When people keep saying with Bitcoin like we'll build this and change thing and do this... that's super super hard to do. There's gonna be a bunch of forks and disagreements and departures from the Blockchain and offchain segwitty, proxy lightning block size increasing etc.. etc... shit we've got to go through. 
It's way way harder. 
And I guess lastly, how often do people get emails hacked even today? The answer is extremely often. That's lovely for your emails, unless your the FBi or State Department who still can't secure them, but if that's all your money in the world. That's an issue.  
The SHA-256 itself is pretty secure, the moment you build anything else on top of it, you're immediately a lot, lot less secure.

@_date: 2017-12-27 03:24:42
I'm going more by efficient markets and ideal conditions. 
You might say a Correction is a Necessary evil, or is something that isn't very bad. But it's ridiculous to say it's "Good" 
Lets say there was an asset that produced a steady stream of income that increased by a set rate every year and was known with a high degree of certainty. 
The value of that asset would rise over time at a very predictable rate, and it wouldn't require any overvaluation, nor would it require correction.
There are right now both upward and downward pressures on any asset. Nothing is growing unchecked, but things don't NEED a 'Correction'. They can rise and decline rationally.

No short data listed on it I could find. 
It shouldn't just be a short squeeze though. 
You should be mostly indifferent between owning GBTC and owning BTC directly, so someone who owns $100,000 of GBTC should be willing to sell their GBTC and buy BTC instead (or Futures) and they're then have 90% more Bitcoin than holding the GBTC shares.
Having a small premium makes some sense for convenience or maybe again, 5%-10% imbalance to short squeezing, but...90% I think has to be in the category this guy is talking about...it's just naive investors who don't know how this works. People who don't usually invest

If that's the primary value, that's just outright zero value to me. 
The entire concept that the currency even requires an ongoing 'development team' pretty much means it's shitty.
There's no reason a better currency can't just continually be made. The crypto we end up using, if we ever really do, likely hasn't been created yet.

No, if i trade you US Dollars for Canadian Dollars, I haven't transferred wealth to you. 
Both the US Dollars and the Bitcoin hold a value, if the early adopter trades asset A worth $20,000 USD for Asset B, $20,000 USD you haven't transferred wealth, you're just changing the currency or medium you hold it in.
A Wealth transfer is more like a tax or where someone exchanges wealth for nothing, or for a consumable.

I think the term has been around a long time, whenever any company leaves a line of business, that's called Demarketing. 
Like if you've got a Wine business, Beer business and Vodka business, but you can't compete on the margins in the vodka business, you exit it, or Demarket it. 
From a bank's point of view they're just saying 'These guys cost more to have as clients than they make me' so they exit those lines of business.

My main complaint with them has been over really low support of currencies, and they appearing to just be keeping most forks, like Bitcoin Gold. 
I've also had some orders just fail when volume is high, like put in a market order it says 'order executed' then it debits and credits the exact same currency instantly and doesn't execute the order.

But a average 'cost-basis' doesn't exist. It's a fiction. You didn't 'average in' you simply made n number of distinct trades
There is a strictly better strategy, and it's a single deployment as a lump sum. 
You don't know what will happen, but you know your bet. If you didn't think it had a positive expected value, you wouldn't be buying it at all.
It's like deciding to hit or stand in blackjack. You just do the mathematically correct strategy and its inferior to do anything else. Only with hindsight can you ever say what turned out to be correct, which you have no access to ahead of time.

If you're sitting there waiting for a paycheque to invest more into crypto, I'd really say you can't afford to do it.

I understand how they're viewed. 
My argument is they're not beneficial and they're not 'Needed' 
Stable growth can happen, this boom bust cycle is not necessary.
The idea it had a 'Much Needed Correction' is wrong and baseless and it's just what people tell themselves to justify the drop. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:52:51
No, see that's the mistake people make. 
You aren't better off playing the $100,000 and buying insurance...you're better off simply playing $70,000 instead of $100,000.
The better solution to the drop in variance is to play less, not to attempt to inefficiently mitigate. 
For the BTC thing, if you thought there's 2 completely equal chances, 50% up, 50% down, you should not invest at all. 
Your investment or lack of investment is equivalent in expected return. 
If you believe it's expected return will be positive, you invest all at once. If you believe it's neutral or negative expected return, don't invest at all, or hold until a later time then invest all at once. 
There's no argument to 'average' in. 
Again, you are not 'Averaging' anything. If you buy at 15k then buy more at 10k....you simply have 2 trades. One that lost $5,000 and one that's neutral.
You haven't changed the variance of those 2 trades.

Think people might be misunderstanding this
There's a thing called the GBTC which is a fund selling shares representing about 0.09258535 of a bitcoin.
Now currently, 0.925~ of a bitcoin is worth like $1750. But the shares in that fund at trading at $3425, almost double the actual price of bitcoin.
Now there should be a small premium of some kind for the security and ease of access etc... but it should not be a 90% premium, maybe like 5-10%.
What this guy is saying is you could Short the GBTC Fund stock, and go long on Bitcoin Futures. 
Even if Bitcoin rises, you're covered, and you profit from the Premium shrinking, not from the price of bitcoin rising or falling.
@_date: 2017-12-29 06:57:33
So we should be aware that in Both cases there ARE fees. But GDAX pays in one. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:02:58
It's not a risk though, that's the guy's point. 
You should the fund, you long the futures. Zero risk, and you eat the premium. 
The tax benefits are a fair point, if you combine tax, plus convenience plus security maybe you can justify a 20-30% premium off that.
But when people can arbitrage out the premium it should evaporate soon.

What do you mean "the corrections are factored in"? 
And Why is it "Good" that it was overvalued to begin with? Wouldn't everyone be better off if it simply rose steadily at a fair market value and was never significantly overvalued, nor significantly corrected?
Also, Why does showing the 'support' help anything? You only need the 'support' if it does 'correct' to begin with, if it never does, why do you need this?
You can see the 'support' in order books anyway. You don't have to 'test' support or any such thing.
Calling Corrections a good thing is really just something to make investors feel good. It's not an actual positive thing.

But it's not the work itself that has value, it's the result. There are certain very important things that need to use gold to accomplish, things in science and medicine and technology. 
If it took all that effort to make something, but the end product wasn't useful for anything, or it had a lot of substitutes, then it wouldn't have the value.
It's not just proof of work, it's the thing itself. 
Even if bars of gold just came fully formed out of the Earth, but there was the same quantity of them, you'd still have a pretty high price for it.

Insured is good, it's just only 2% is insured, so like if it all goes down, you've still got a lot of people out of luck, or collecting pennies on the dollar. 
I think its just like overall the complete inability to 'reverse' a transaction, its actually a selling point of BTC, but its also one of the biggest drawbacks. Breaches in security are completely permanent losses.

It could have a very strong effect in the negative direction, but it's hard to imagine it would have a positive effect.
Think of it this way, Futures offer an alternative to holding bitcoin, you can still be invested in it, but without security concerns, concerns about long transaction time delays, and without the risk of marketplaces or someone else stealing your money. 
So it lets you be involved and capture upside, without taking a lot of the extraneous risks. 
Then the flip of it is also that people will now have a legitimate way to short the market, for the first time ever you'll have potentially strong downside pressure on the market from large organized sources. 
There's also only ever been a few niche reasons to 'attack' the bitcoin blockchain, but there could easily be a massive incentive to attack it if you can go short side in a leveraged way. 
I'm not sure that will happen, but I think it's a risk at least. 
The only real counter argument I can think of is it actually lets someone hedge their position for the first time, so that may help secure big holdings, but I'm not sure I'm convinced by that. 
I might just sit it out when we hit that point.

Right, but isn't a better solution not being Euphoric?

That miiight be true. But also lets face it, Every Bitcoin market out there currently SUCKS, like sucks screaming and shouting outloud sucks. 
Like compared to even the cheapest online brokerage accounts for stocks.
If an actual financial company said they'd use their platform to let you trade bitcoin, I'm sure people would flock to it.

When your coins are 'on an exchange' they're just all sitting in a big pile, they're not segregated as yours and you don't have direct control of them. 
And then exchanges get hacked or robbed from the inside or go bankrupt.

That's kind of more the 'order book' on a given market more than the actual depth of it.

Has Bitcoin successfully adopted changes? No. it's repeatedly failed to, forking off improvement attempts. 
is the hash power stable? No, it could defect at any time.
Is it the most 'Altruistic community'? What the fuck? no.
Are alt coins just copies? Many of them are not, many are vast, vast improvements on the technology.

It is a fairly fundamental long term problem though.

If you open a company and got $50,000,000 invested, and the price did go down, then you couldn't pay back the $50,000,000.
You're just saying you'll give back the principal, it's not actually guaranteed by anything, you'd just be lying to people. 
If on the other hand you did have $50,000,000 sitting around to guarantee it if you lost...you'd be better off just investing the $50,000,000 in Bitcoin yourself.

If they stole it, it's theirs. They'll have to obscure the path and try to get the money out of the network without showing who they are. 
They can jump between cryptos probably to best obscure the path, trade BTC for ETH or something then sell.

Just want to point out that 'Dollar Cost Averaging' is never optimal mathematically. 
It helps people delude themselves and encourages them to chase losses. 
But if you have an asset you expect to rise buy it all at once. 
The only time to 'average in' is when you don't have a choice, in other words you can only afford to allocate $500 a month. If you have a lump sum, spend the lump sum.
There's papers on this dating back to the 60s and 70s, it's never optimal to Dollar Cost Average.

Lets say your Salary is $15,000 a month, but I've agreed to pay you in Bitcoin. 
If BTC is worth $15,000 I'll give you 1 per month. If it's worth $7,500 I give you 2 per month. If it's worth $30,000 you get 0.5 per month.
You're paid WITH bitcoin, but you're simply receiving the Fiat dollar equivalent to it. You're getting $15,000 a month regardless.
On the other hand if I agreed to pay someone IN Bitcoin I'm agreeing to pay them 1 Bitcoin per month regardless of its cost.
If Bitcoin rises to $30,000 they still get 1. If it drops to $7,500 they still get 1. If Bitcoin rose to $1,000,000 they'd still get 1. 
Those are very, very different things.

That's fine, but I don't think that's generally what people are referring to. Every time there's a drop in price a lot of people come out like 'Great! time to buy!' as if they've just got some lump sum of money sitting around and that the drop is somehow beneficial to them.

But with bitcoin people are constantly, constantly, constantly glossing over parts of this technology and hiding weaknesses.
Then people constantly get just hard fucked by those things. 
We keep telling people 'Oh there's no fee' then the market raises the fees and they're stuck. 
We keep telling people 'Its in your wallet on that exchange' and we' all know it's not, its in their collective wallet
We keeping telling people 'When it forks, you'll get both coins' and then that's not true because the wallet or market or whatever doesn't support it for months or sometimes not at all.
We keeping telling them 'That's the bitcoin price' and never say there is no one price it's 7000 different completely separate markets and then people get fucked over by some markets when their price goes crazy compared to the rest. 
We keep fucking over simplifying every goddamn thing to new people, and they end up trusting shit that isn't true.

No one says 'Bcash' unless they're trying to slight Bitcoin Cash.
Bitcoin is named Bitcoin and no one can change it to 'Bitcoin Core' 
And Bitcoin Cash named themselves Bitcoin Cash, and no one else can change that either. 
When someone says 'Bcash' I know they're being a biased idiot, and one someone says 'Core' I know they're being a biased idiot. So I guess it's valuable for that.

There's also just no reason your country's currency can't be put on a blockchain. 
They could just one day take however much money you own, and that's how much you now have in the blockchain version of the Dollar and they could build everything right into that chain to accommodate government lending/borrowing and so on.

What those regulatory bodies require, essentially if you trade cryptos they're going to have to spend maybe 10 to 20 hours a year filing on you and monitoring you, so most clients aren't worth the cost of that. It's not a 30 second decision, they're forced to document all this random dumb stuff

If their program is strong enough to mitigate the risks and track and report it, that's fine. 
Ideally the OCC and FRB have the banks monitor and report on you, but some banks don't do that well, so the simply demarket those clients instead of paying to address the risk.

Because it's just not classified as that, only certainly things would apply under acquiring computer information. 
Taking Bitcoin does not imply you took anything at all from their computer. 
No, those things are not true with cash. It is illegal to steal it, you're simply saying 'Is there proof?' that's universally true. I'm saying the bitcoin theft is simply not illegal even with proof. 
You could have video evidence of someone moving bitcoin from your wallet to your wallet while they holdup their Passport and yell 'I'm taking his bitcoin' and it's not illegal.

Nice martyrdom for something everyone will like. 
But you're kind of stuck in a paradox, using it actually helps destabilize the price because no major vendor accepting it keeps it, they collect it and immediately convert it.  
It's only useful as a currency after the price stabilizes somewhat, and the only was for it to stabilize is to attain both the market cap and usability of a real currency. 
Also, most people are buying things with normal money just fine, there's only limited niches for this thing. Most people in it are in it for the capital gain.   
So you're stuck between a rock and a hard place, you need enough people to buy and hodl it to stablize the price enough that someone can legitimately accept it as a real currency instead of as a novelty
@_date: 2018-08-20 22:26:44
I'm sure Paypal can freeze it. There'd be a clear line of legal recourse. But yeah, Paypal kind of falls into that area where it's some website that could fuck you over. It's big enough and follows a lot of laws and regulations though, you'd have strong legal recourse. 
I understand how LBC works, and I understand you would have no way to get your coins back if they simply took them. 
You're simply trusting them as the escrow agent. 
I know LBC didn't scam the client, but they're behaving badly in a way that would not be permitted by a financial institution as as result of that initial scam situation.
And that scammer's particular case is a great lesson for people...something can be reputable for years and then with all that credibility stored up, fuck everyone. 
That's happened again and again and again, something gets popular and has a lot of deposits and someone realizes "Hmm, I will make more money just stealing all this than I'd get in service fees" and they steal it all. 
That just can't happen at a bank. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 23:19:04
Seizing accounts of criminals is actually very difficult to do, confiscating cash or property is easy, but freezing accounts is remarkably hard. 
I think what I'm trying to say people are missing is the scammer or the fact that he got scammed means nothing, its completely irrelevant. The scammer doesn't have his money, LBC has the money.
LBC could just give it back to him. LBC is holding it in a 'Escrow' they don't have to hold it in. LBC is not answering him or helping him. 
I do agree the focus here should be on the escrow service, they've seized his money autonomously.

So you're telling me the completed unregulated an uncontrollable currency being traded on a website made by people in their 20s to evade taxation or tracking has wronged you in some way?   
I'm stunned.   
I do hope you get some resolution, but its also bizarre to see these appeals to authority and rules when adopting something in which those are unenforceable. When someone else gets control on your coins even if they tell you they'll give them back, they're theirs now. That's the system. 
@_date: 2018-08-22 03:33:51
What? 
That's not what I said...
I'm honestly baffled about what people still don't understand here. Bitcoin is not recognized as anything whatsoever. It's a completely digital good. Most countries have no laws for the theft of digital goods with the exception of securities and cash. 
Bitcoin is neither in most countries. 
Honestly what in the sweet fuck do you not understand? 
Telling most police your bitcoin was stolen is the same as telling them someone stole your Rainbow or took your sense of humour.
@_date: 2018-08-20 23:08:15

If they stole it and its in cash it can be physically seized, the person can be arrested and jailed. 
In most scam cases, yes of course the money is sitting in a bank account. Where'd you get that from? But regardless, property and money can be seized.
And yes those are civil cases...in other words NOT FUCKING ILLEGAL jesus fucking christ how many fucking times do I have to repeat it? THERE ARE NOT LAWS MAKING BITCOIN THEFT ITSELF ILLEGAL

You're losing me on the selling or repurchasing the miners.
What are you talking about there?
If you already own the miners, its a sunk cost. You can decide to close shop and sell the miners themselves, but you wouldn't just sit with the miners inactive if they're still profitable, the price you paid for them isn't relevant.
The math isn't working out for me.
I also saw you edited your thing to say your break\-even point is $0...that doesn't make any sense either, surely your is higher than their if your electricity costs more?
If your rigs cost like $1.50 a day to run, but only made $0.25 a day, why would you keep it running? Can't you sell the electricity you generate as well?
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:08:59
I'm not sure what you're talking about or how it addresses anything I said.   
Are you under the impression there's any jurisdiction or authority that can order the return or transfer of bitcoin? In most jurisdictions, no it isn't a monetary asset in the first place, but there's also no mechanism by which that sort of order could be placed.

You're wrong on both of these. Nothing you're saying is true. 
People have asked you questions over and over here, you evade them.
You're complete lying.

In what universe do you think a government can order or enforce the return of crypto? 
most countries have not written whole new sets of laws covering these situations. In most countries Bitcoin might as well be a sword on your WoW character, there is not a system of laws around it. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 21:48:58

The math for shutting down the miners should be simple Revenues - Variable Costs
 
This idea of re-selling the miners also makes no sense...if someone buys miners, then the bitcoin price drops a lot, they couldn't possibly sell them for a profit. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 15:05:31
What were they charged with?  
\ Money Laundering and Identity Theft  
\ " the crime of illegally acquiring computer information " 
Neither were charged with stealing Bitcoin. Both committed other crimes while in the act of obtaining or laundering the bitcoin.   
Hacking is illegal, laundering is illegal, identity theft is illegal.
But if someone says 'Hold this bitcoin for me and give it back to me later' and you don't give it back. That's not illegal (in most countries)  
If someone accidentally posts their public key and you take it, that's not illegal.   
If you can guess someone's password and take it, that's not illegal
The actual Bitcoin theft part isn't illegal. 
@_date: 2018-05-28 17:43:07
I'm not clear, why would they turn off miners above the variable cost?
If I'm assuming you mine the 0.00082 per miner per day and the cost of running that miner, lets say your electric \+ cooling is $1.50... 
Shouldn't you continue mining until about $2000? 
You wouldn't buy new miners but why would you shut down your existing miners? I don't follow you on that point. 
I just run GPU miners on Ethereum, but I've done the similar math there, and I can't see why I'd shut them off short of about a $150 ETH. 
Also, if people start to shut off... then you have less competition and you mine more, so if 50&amp; of people turned off their miners, you might keep mining to $1000 instead of $2000. 
The whole thing is basically arbitrage, right?
@_date: 2018-08-22 02:28:09
No, theft isn't theft. 
The laws either recognize things as an object of value or not. Many countries, most, do not have laws to accept an asset like this as property. Again, they treat it like a sword in an MMO, it's computery thing without value. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 13:00:36
But I think again the nature of the Bitcoin protocol is such that there's no recourse for such a failure. 
There is no legal avenue he can take to get it back because it's bitcoin. If this was the British Pound, he'd have his money back already.

I just don't get how you're getting to this gap between 2k and 7k?   
Are you saying the big guys are paying literally 1/5th the electricity costs?
Also, even building off grid electricity doesn't mean the cost is $0.00/kwh
I assume that equipment has a certain cost and life and produces a certain amount? That's your cost isn't it? 
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:18:36
That's incredibly naive. 
We can see in mining things do increase and drop based on prices already, why would they not drop if price fell very far? 
Also if we 'got really big' why would the price have dropped that much? 
The current BTC mining shutdown points would be at like $2kish. 
Mining operations aren't going to just all keep going at a loss because they want to support the coin or something, that's nonsense.

You're essentially completely right, yes.
If mining becomes 'unprofitable' then mining power would drop off making it profitable again.
It's basically a big arbitrage situation that has certain friction and pain points, largely revolving around electricity costs. 
This is even more true for GPU mining where the miners can seamlessly switch from one coin to another, but even within Bitcoin and ASICs its essentially correct its just a bit more friction and stuff

I understand the infrastructure costs, I don't follow this selling the miner thing...how could that play into the breakeven rate?
The upfront cost and the salvage cost shouldn't impact the shutdown point. 
How are people buying miners and selling them used for $1,000 more? What does this have to do with a breakeven point?
This math just does not add up. Breakeven point should only include variable costs, but you're adding in fixed costs and salvage values. 
@_date: 2018-05-29 14:06:55
Everyone understood that, it's just wrong to what he's saying. That series of actions contains no relevant information to a break even point or a shutdown point of miners.

Everyone understands what you are saying. But It's not correct.
You're saying you, and large companies buy miners, then speculate on the price of the miners and resell them. 
What I, and about 10 other people are telling you, is you're simply speculating on price of BTC, selling the miners doesn't have anything to do with a break even point, or the shut down value of the miners. 
Everyone understands what you are saying, you're simply 100% wrong about the accounting of it. 
It's also pretty clear from some of the other people you've made these posts before and you do not in fact own a bitcoin mining farm at all and you're making this all up. 
 
@_date: 2018-05-29 15:42:30
Because he's talking about the breakeven point. The break even price is about $5,500 lower than the current price. He's not talking about a 5% dip...however we can see that mining power does shift on those dips and increases. 
For instance in April the mining power dipping from 33 Exahash to 23 Exahash in only 6 days. The rate generally still increases but it isn't immune to price changes, it shifts. 
Remember the miners can, and do, switch their operations to other coins when it becomes profitable to do so, like right now Bitcoin is only actually the 4th most profitable coin using SHA-256
And what do you mean by 'security' is valuable...to who? who would pay you for it? What are you securing?
I could understand an operation mining losing like 1% of their costs, but Negative interest rates aren't like -25% a year. 
And again, if it got big in terms of usage...why would the price drop like 75%?
There's just not really a situation where you'd run these big mining operations intentionally at a loss.

That's not a contradiction at all... He doesn't think the currency should be out of the blue, he does think existing currency can just be moved to a chain... and he's right. 
Christine Lagarde: “I think the banking industry has quite a few good days ahead of it”
From Fiat Defectors - “I think the banking industry has quite a few good days ahead of it”
From Fiat Defectors - banking industry has quite a few days left....and I think we are about to see massive disruptions. 
Again those are not contradictory statements...at all. 
George Soros: Thinks Bitcoin is a bubble, green lights his firm to trade it... 
Guess what I'd do if I was  from the future and knew something was a bubble? I'd trade the fuck out of it. 
Mark Cuban: "Nope I havn't invested in Bitcoin yet, I go up and down on it" After: Yes, i bought some. 
Ok, so someone asked and he said he was considering it and undecided...then he apparently later on did buy some. This doesn't seem like a reversal of criticism or something. 
Thomas Peterffy: Again, how are these statements even a little contradictory? I'm worried its volatile and I think listing it on major markets is good.. 
I think of the 12 people listed there...they've shown 3 that actually have contradictory statements where they changed their opinion.

Well, no, that's the difference. Yes, you do own that money. 
If someone steals it from the bank, the bank has to reimburse you. If the bank itself steals it the CDIC or FDIC or whatever your equivalent is re-imbusres it. 
If it's lost due to some technical issue or failure, it can be restored and recreated. If someone defrauds me through false transactions or fraudulent activity, those things can be refunded and reimbursed. 
There's also an entire legal system in place that defines what that money is, the ownership of it, the obligations and rights of people holding, depositing and investing it and regulatory and policing forces keeping an eye on it.
That's the primary benefit of non-blockchain currencies. Things can be reversed, corrected, insured and/or restored

Simply borrowing the money is pretty normal, all of Trump's spending has just been debt spending.
The idea of actually minting Platinum coins is interesting, I hadn't heard that, but reading the article is feels like that's the idea of the author of the article, not something Ocasio-Cortez has said. It reads like they're taking the wording in the resolution and coming up with a few fairly extreme ideas for what it could end up meaning.

'Saving is giving yourself a loan'  
This is the primary issue. Wealthy people stay wealthy by doing nothing and not investing funds.  
That's why inflation is important, in order to stay rich to the same degree you have to continue to make good investments into things.   
In a Deflationary world, the Rockefellers would be worth Trillions.   
The entire point of inflation is that currently rich people need to keep investing and deploying their money to maintain wealth and that new people can emerge as wealthy as times change. Bill Gates or Jeff Bezos aren't possible in a deflationary world, we'd all be under the Medici family or something with a quadrillion dollars.

You could say it with anything fungible too and it still applies. Actually you could easily make it fungible and say its prints for a painting. Now it's all the same painting, me printing more lowers the value of any one of them, but isn't stealing.    
Trying to nitpick your way out of the basic point is kind of idiotic.
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:54:37
People are not taking it as hyperbole in this thread they're taking it as literal. 
If you're conceding the point that it's not stealing, that it simply lowers the value...then yes, that's obviously correct. 
They can't always do it there's obviously a point where it completely breaks, that's happened a number of times to a number of countries.  And it being a liability isn't contingent upon whether you can do it more or not, it's literally a liability.
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:44:42
This doesn't seem to have anything to do with the model? You could just make a model that says "Price = Time\^2" and it'd go up. It's a bad model though.

This one i found is just form a few days ago  [   
Academically speaking, this is kind of the 'big paper' on it  [ from 1979   
and This is a really interesting recent paper explaining why people insist on believing it despite it being disproven  [
@_date: 2019-03-13 21:15:16
Do you disagree with that statement? 
If you do, there's no point convincing you, but everyone who reads it will understand how dumb you are.
You literally do not believe time value of money applies to bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-03-13 18:50:37
I think you're living in the fantasy world here, you think people are doing stuff out of passion, or some how there's a bunch of billionaires out there spending more money than they make? 
Also are you like, unfamiliar with the term risk-free rate? If you don't even know what that is, then that's probably conversation over right there.
I kind of did do the math for you, but I believe that you don't know what those terms mean. 
So let's give an example.
Tim inherits $10 Billion in the current world that has Inflation.
If Tim does nothing for 20 years the value of his $10 billion at 2% inflation is 6.73 Billion in present value
If Tim does nothing to invest, and spends $200 million a year to 'eat' he's now at only $2.73 Billion in present value. 
But Tim doesn't want to do nothing of course, he invests his money... If he wants to do it safely he invests it in T-Bills, at 2.75% now even with his spending he's got $7.6 Billion. 
Maybe he doesn't want to be so safe, and he instead invests it in the stock market in an index fund. He'll make 7% a year, now after his spending he's way better, $21+ Billion in today's dollars. Go Tim.
Now lets put the same Tim in the same position, but he's in a 2% Deflation world instead of a 2% inflation world.
If Tim does nothing he's now got $14.8 Billion after 20 years.
Lets say he spends the same $200 million a year... 
He's got a constant $10 Billion. 
Let's say he buys T-Bills, now at 6.75% real return he's got  $32 Billion even after spending. 
Lets say now he's invested in the stock market, now at 11%, Tim has $75 Billion
No Matter What Tim does, if he does nothing, if he invests it in safe things, riskier things, if he spends nothing, spends a lot...no matter what the rich Tim is better off in the Deflationary world. 
Deflation makes the rich richer. That's it primary mechanic, the people who currently have more money naturally gain more money in purchasing power. 
There's no mathematical way around this. 2 people making the same spending decisions, investing decisions etc... the one in the deflationary world will always be better off. 
What part of that isn't clear?  
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:47:11
But you're proposing a system where doing nothing isn't 0.5% a year. By proposing a deflationary currency you're saying doing literally nothing would earn something each year...meaning doing any risk-free lending must then earn that rate + something and investing would be that risk-free rate + something. You've increased the cost of capital by a huge amount immediately. 
And no one is suggesting that the Rockefellers would 'stop their business' why would they do that? Other new forms of business would develop. But in your deflationary world, their businesses and old money wouldn't lose value in comparison, your ability to over-take them with new ideas would be vastly diminished.
How much do you think a billionaire has to 'spend to live'? What type of idiotic idea is that, they're going to burn through their money eating? 
Just to expound on some of that math, less say Inflation of 2% was instead deflation of 2%...now a T-Bill is 6.78% instead of 2.78%
A Mortgage is now 7.95% at Prime, the Expected rate of return of the S&amp;P is now 16%...  
You've just annihilated anyone looking to borrow or raise capital for anything.
@_date: 2019-11-05 22:19:47
Well, I don't obviously, and again that would seem to refer to a collapse on a world wide scale.  
People fleeing WW2 Germany didn't smuggle boxes of ammo over the border to sell in America.   
I know the world is like 'smaller' these days, but even if the US descended into civil war, it wouldn't necessarily mean China collapsed completely for instance
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:49:02
Investments would actually now have a higher rate of return, whether they do or do not invest, simply being richer first conveys a greater advantage in deflation then it does in inflation. 
It makes it harder and harder for the newcomer to overtake the old winner.
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:03:04
It's a thing people might intuitively think is 'popular' so they use it as a dumb comparison.

Then its a model missing a component so important that makes it not a good model.   
forget altcoins, it is a model that can't account for changes to Bitcoin demand.
@_date: 2019-11-25 18:51:43
Yeah, but I'm saying that is the primary criticism. It just assumes a demand.
@_date: 2019-11-05 17:02:59
The doesn't apply generally to 'rich people' it's quite specific to entities specifically in the position of being first actors on new money supply flow.    
There's also strong counter-points to the affect, for instance there's a 2012 paper on how this process plays out with money recipients with 'savers', as was the case post 2008 bailout.   
 [   
The Cantillon effect is generally one of those 'In theory this kind of makes sense, but it's not actually observed happening' sort of things.   
Also people act like 'the rich' is somehow only bankers in a shadowy room. Inflation is not the reason Bezos, Gates, Carlos Slim etc... get rich and it's dumb to say it is or somehow ignore that the richest people in the world are not in some purely financial area.  Only like 2 of the 50 richest people (Warren Buffet, Jospeh Safra) are this sort of thing where maybe they'd have some mild benefit from this 'effect'
@_date: 2019-11-25 19:45:05
That doesn't follow logically.   
It could be that, but that's one possibility of many different possible ways.
@_date: 2019-03-21 17:18:17

Yeah, the general methods are using other things to break the line of sight. If you just do all your manipulation on the chain itself, of course someone can unravel it.

Credit Unions also still have a lot less AML/KYC Requirements so they have less obligation to fulfill those regulatory things and they have less liability on anti-fraud as well. So it's not as large a concern, the downside of course is for many types of payments they still go through banks as correspondents so you might still get blocked internationally.

What's your math, what's your actual source or back up to this?
You probably recommend DCA because people do not have them oney to invest all at once, not because its a good strategy.

Inflation is a 'theft' against the richest possible people, and even then only ones who hold a lot of cash-like assets.   
Poor people don't have money sitting around to lose its value.   
How did you all get brainwashed into this idea that inflation somehow hurts people who don't have the asset being inflated?
@_date: 2019-11-25 20:48:58
It's attempting to. But it's done so by retrofitting the results form the past and then is claiming accuracy by evaluating how successful the model would be in the past. 
If you pick a few points after it was posted, it's way off, like thousands of dollars off. Like I think his original big post explaining it was posted March 22nd, on March 26th it's off by like $4000. 
So much of this modelling people love really really relies on the fact that logarithmic charts really hide how far off some things are. 
There's times in 2017 when the 'model' predicts values at $9000 when it was at $800 and parts of 2016 it predicts $90 when it was at $1000 but on a log chart, they look 'kinda close' 
And the charts put out show like these 'bands' like 'It'd this line, but somewhere between these bands..." Any value from about $20,000 to $350,000 is 'in the band' 
Also, given that the model essentially cannot predict a drop... it's kind of stupid.

@_date: 2019-11-05 20:11:16
So you're like, in the ballpark of something that makes sense here, but you're kind of vastly misunderstanding the process and the amounts and interest rates involved here. 
Like I don't know where you get the idea of money being 'lent at zero percent interest' from. 
Also, when you say the 'Rest of us' how much of your money is sitting in Dollars at any given time? 
For me, like under a tenth of a percent of my net worth is in dollars maybe?
Who are these poor and middle class people you think are sitting there with huge amounts of US Dollars sitting somewhere? 
If you're taxing or even 'stealing' old money sitting in cash and Tbills from wealthy people not investing it...I don't care. That's the entire point of inflation, to force them not to sit on that money. 
Look into how the central bank is 'creating' money too, most money is created by banks through lending cycles, its not this central bank giving money mechanic, and none of it is at 0% interest.

Lol, well, yes. I know all this, I kind of hope everyone in this thread knows at least that stuff, though Im starting to think they don't.   
I wasn't saying they were borrowing the money, I said they either sell securities to get the new money OR they borrow it.   
For TARP, they mostly sold securities to get it.   
So I'm not certain what part of what I'm saying you're trying to correct?
@_date: 2019-11-25 21:08:04
Well, lets start at basics... What bank from and to? what 'transactions like this'? Do they know its intended for crypto? Why do you need to transfer it between banks to begin with? 
How are you trying to transfer it? Which Cryptocurrency marketplace? (some are indeed scams) 
It is true that sometimes if a client is being scammed, they will eventually not allow a client to do something specific, like wiring money to a stranger in another country. But I've never heard of a case where a bank disallowed a transfer to the client's own account.
@_date: 2019-03-13 17:56:54
It doesn't actually matter for the argument if there's a monoploy or not, but yeah you could certainly say there is on any individual painting.   
I think the analogy of painting prints fits this the closest.
@_date: 2019-03-21 21:32:26
Again, I'm not sure what that addresses?
Being paid *IN* Bitcoin = Set BTC Salary
Being paid *WITH* Bitcoin = Not set in BTC
I don't think I ever said it as 'being paid using BTC' but being paid 'using' it would be the same as being paid 'with' it, as in not denominated in it as a BTC amount. 
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:26:45
You've got to put a really high level of skepticism on it I think.   
It was designed by retrofitting the formula to a lot of already known data, and it doesn't apply to other assets. So It's not really a model at all, it's more like a 'best fit formula'   
The underlying concept that supply affects price is pretty obvious, but as many have pointed out, it ignores demand, ignores world events, and unlike Gold or silver where supply is not a certainty, Bitcoin's is deterministic.
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:39:33
I don't see the mental effort required in placing a single trade and buying at one point.

But they didn't, who are 'they'?
Did Gates, Bezos, Carlos Slim, Sam Walton etc.. get rich by 'printing money'?
I think some small group of financial firms benefit from lending money, that's how banks work. But that's like, 2 of the richest 50 people?
And how the fuck did they steal it from ME? Or My Retired Parents? 
I don't have a bunch of dollars sitting around, my retired parents don't have dollars sitting around.

Yeah, and 20-30 years form now that might be the case. But until then, yes, that's literally exactly what Tether is intended to be, it's a temporary on/off ramp.
edit: also for Libra, what is it trying to be? It's just trying to be a third party payment provider for people, including people in countries without access to these things. It has a valid use case that has nothing to do with the other reasons people want crypto...and really it being a crypto is kind of irrelevant, it could just be a ledger held by facebook
@_date: 2019-11-23 23:45:53
Are you advocating the opposite...intentionally buy things you think will drop?
@_date: 2019-11-26 00:11:25
Yeah, it's one of those things where it should be your choice...but banks get so many disputes, charge backs, reversal requests, fraud claims etc... from a few of these exchanges, and Coinbase might be  for just sheer volume of complaints. 
It may not even be their fault at all, but its just a huge attraction for all kinds of scams, frauds and totally illegitimate charge backs.
@_date: 2019-11-25 16:16:51
Determined retroactively.   
It hasn't been very accurate since it was published, but of course you can take 10 years of past data and create something that follows it. That'd be impressive if you created it 10 years ago, but not retrofitting your formula to already known data.   
Also while the Stock-to-Flow metric is clearly of some value, which of course everyone knew anyway, it just isn't the whole story and is a massive over simplification. You also can't use this same 'model' for other assets.   
You can't just plug in the gold S2F and get a valid number, you've got to change rates as well, which kind of means it's not a predictive model...it's a responsive one.
@_date: 2019-11-25 17:53:41
There isn't a benefit, just accept that. 
If you'd 'Worry' with a single point of investment, that's irrational and your own psychological problem.
You're also not even describing DCA, you're defending a thing you're not even doing. 
If you're doing it randomly it's not even DCA in the first place

Well, it's a totally different thing trying to accomplish a totally different thing. 
I don't think Libra will really take off either, mostly for political reasons, but I don't think pegging to a currency is the reason. There is a solid use case for the utility and value of a stablecoin pegged to an asset.

You buy it, you maintain it, it depreciates. 
At least my home has tripled in value, so it literally does make money.

@_date: 2019-11-05 15:18:43
It's an interesting hypothetical situation...but when does this situation occur?  
People keep acting like this is the important thing, dollars holding their value over time.   
Who are these people holding vast amounts of dollars in actual dollar form, let alone people forced to for 10+ years?  
My assets are like 80% house, 15% Investment and retirement funds, like 5% crypto still and like under 1% is 'Dollars'   
If anything, because of Mortgage, I'm 'short' like $300,000 still, I kind of want dollars to inflate to de-value my debt compared to my home value.   
So I just don't get this situation or how it relates to the real world, especially for lower to even like sub-0.1% income people.

I'm not saying people do not do it, many many people DO it. It's proven to be suboptimal.  
The thing people literally cannot for some reason wrap their head around is the difference between investing small amounts over time out of \*necessity\* and doing it as a \*strategy\*  
If you invest $500 a month because you cannot invest $10,000 then that's what you have to do. But if you have $10,000 you should invest it all at once.

I agree that deflationary economies increase the cost of capital, making it harder to get people to invest their money, that's literally my entire point. Deflationary economies are bad.

But it's only one possible way. If I say the Eagles will beat the Steelers you can't say "oh, so you're saying it's going to be 87 to 3" that's just one way it could occur. 
It's possible the TV$ doubles and it doesn't get there, it's possible it less than doubles but does get there, its possible it more than doubles and does or doesn't get there. 
It does make it a tangible prediction...not one i agree with, but it's a valid prediction because there's many ways it could happen this excludes and few ways to happen where it's correct.
Also, while no more BTC is exchanged, it still represents a doubling of fiat offered, so it does in fact refer to a doubling of the demand. Saying 'I think the price will double when the dollar denominated demand doubles' is a fairly rational thought. Perhaps a bit linear, but rational.

It's not meant to be an investment at all. Its purpose is to be something you can trade in and out of without having to convert to fiat directly.   
It's almost certainly worse than keeping money in your bank account, but it's better than keeping 'USD' on some fly by night exchange

What else stores value quite that well though?   
Silver and gold and stuff did have value 6000 years ago, why would it not in a post-apocalyptic world too?   
These metals have specific uses and they're very easy to work with.   
Gold is largely about escape value too, societies collapse, but it's never collapsed 100% throughout the entire world at once. Germany or Venezuela or Rome or Persia or something collapses, but people can grab something small and portable and get the hell out with a bar worth $1 million weighing 40 lbs.   
The idea is just if your dollar collapses maybe he can carry his 35lbs of Silver to Canada or something.

It's a tax on non-deployed wealth.

@_date: 2019-03-13 18:01:03
And my point is that while you certainly may be diluting it, no, you're not stealing it.   
Of course you're diluting the value, but in the case of the money... who is actually then 'stealing' that value?   
You print money, that money is now a liability on the Central Bank balance sheet... the banks who get the currency itself have to give up assets which have value in order to get that newly printed money, so they're trading like $500 Million for $500 Million, or they're borrowing it short-term.   
So you've likely diluted the value of the money itself, but who 'stole' that value?

@_date: 2019-11-25 22:47:39
Ok, then I'm guessing this makes a ton of sense for the bank to deny.   
You're using a method of transfer they'll have no recourse for, you're sending it to another bank from some company that says you have to use that bank, people can create 'virtual bank accounts' to receive the money.   
They've very likely had a bunch of fraud and attempted chargebacks to the marketplace you're not even willing to name and so they're blocking payments.   
Again your unwillingness to say the bank from, bank to or marketplace makes this really hard to know if their decision is legitimate or not.   
If you're trying to transfer to a bank in Cyprus for an account with GoxTrade...then they're justified in blocking it.   
If they're blocking a transfer to a reputable exchange being properly banked at a place, the bank is bad...if like I likely suspect since you won't name them, you're trying to transfer to some scammy exchange,  the bank is probably in the right.
@_date: 2019-11-26 00:09:11
Yeah, it does kind of give the answer though, Swedbank has had bitstamp's SEPA accounts blocked since about 2013, so have many of the major banks.
In this case you've got two issues, one is that Swedbank has been massively fined and sanctioned over past money laundering violations, so they're not looking to take on high risk activity like that.
And Bitstamp continues to be one of the most unreliable little money freezing types of exchanges. People constantly, constantly try to reverse transfers to them and complain about lost money, refusal to allow withdrawals etc... 
So a lot of banks have said 'fuck these guys' years ago, and just won't deal with them.
@_date: 2019-11-05 20:56:29
But who the fuck is in that situation? 
If some person has dollars and held dollars uninvested for 60 years, you're god damn right that person should lose the value in that money. 
I fully 100% endorse the 'theft' of value from that person. It's the fundamental principle behind the flow of the economy and it should be. You must invest money to maintain wealth.

There's no such thing as 'Dollar cost averaging'

Buy if its a good idea to buy, don 't let the concept that it 'averages' your past trades influence decisions
@_date: 2019-11-24 16:38:22
Yeah, that's the correct strategy...you buy when you feel it's appropriate to buy.
Dollar Cost Averaging is the idea that if you buy periodically you create an 'average price' with the idea that it lowers your risk level and it can make a past bad trade better because you're 'averaging down'
@_date: 2019-11-20 21:54:22
Well, because most of us don't need to make that type of transaction.   
So if you want the wide adoption, it has to be on another premise.   
Those premises tend to be the idea of money free from central bank influence, which again isn't really important to most people because they aren't wealthy enough to care about the depreciation of hoarded cash or something,  
and the last premise is the potential to make a lot of money being an early adopter into something that may gain wide use someday.  
Most people are in that last group, we're in it as an investment predicated on a belief it will become more mainstream.

Economy is actually the system of how to distribute resources. So if the current monetary system went down, yes you'd need a new economy.   
The problem is the distribution. If it collapses, there's no mechanisms in place to move the carrots from the ground or mine the copper in exchange for things, you'd be back to bartering or something.

I don't know what 'most folks consider it' but that's not what it is. 
The thing you're describing which is 'Averaging In' is also suboptimal and a stupid mental obfuscation trick too though. It's created to make people feel better about past lost money...you can 'Average down' and make it look like you lost less than you did. It's an act of self deception.

No, this is a severe misunderstanding. 
1) You can exchange cash for crypto, that's incredibly common. 
2) The idea is the crypto replaces the need for the cash. If people can just pay you, and you can pay them in this way, you don't actually need to deal with the 'placement' phase of anything, you're beginning in the system and now you just have to eventually integrate. 
Property is one of the best ways to Integrate funds, but it is not a solution for Placement, crypto is though.

This has literally never made any sense to me.
What absolute fucking moron is sitting around with wealth in US Dollars? 
If you're poor, you don't have cash sitting around so you can hardly be preserving your wealth in dollars.
If you're wealthy, you invest your dollars into securities and assets.
I'm kind of in the middle, I've got money in crypto, but the majority of my wealth is in stocks and most is just my home. The asset of my home seems to appreciate in value when there's inflation, and the debt I owe depreciates in value due to inflation. So inflation seems to be good for me, especially with locked in interest rates. 
Who in the fuck is out there with significant portions of their wealth sitting in actual dollars and losing value due to inflation?
Who are these mythical people?

I don't think people are joining Bitfinex, loading US Dollars then Buying Tether...
I think people are Buying Bitcoin, then when selling Bitcoin they sell for Tether... but some of the buyers aren't paying Tether, they're paying USD, I think then Bitfinex is pocketing the USD and 'printing' new Tether.
I don't get the motivation for why someone would actually exchange USD for Tether, but I do get the motivation for Bitfinex to match BTC/Tether seller with Cash buyers and keep the Cash.

Such a dumb point, you can basically sum this up as
"If we quadruple the number of investors in Bitcoin, it might raise the price" 
But then the author seems to try and assume that money flowing in will add directly to the market cap, that doesn't make any sense.   
$200 Billion in new purchasing does not increase the cap by $200 Billion. It could be more or less than that. 
Whoever wrote this literally has no idea what marketcap is. 
" January’s average Bitcoin market cap was $222 billion. The US investors represented 63&amp; of the 20 million global investors, and the US investor purchased an average of $3,500 in Bitcoin. US investors equate to $44.1 billion, or 20&amp; of the total January market cap, leaving $178 billion or $24,000 per investor for the rest of the world. "
This is 100&amp; wrong. The amount they purchased and the amount they own are not the same thing.

It'd be like getting a psychiatrist to tell everyone I don't have cancer.
Also the wording...as mentioned in the thread you linked me to, is very weaselly. 
Also there's no assurance that money is locked in or obligated or anything, nothing is preventing its withdrawal or use for other things, even if you take it at face value, its saying this money simply exits in some place on a certain day in the past, but doesn't offer any assurance it will be there in the future.

The industry is actually mostly going the other direction.   
Everyone wants to bank these things because it's a lucrative customer...crypto companies send a lot of wires and hold deposits in cash.

But many are actively working on getting good coverage and processes on these things to make it cheaper to track so they can keep these things.

It's incredibly common to sell crypto for cash, there's whole exchanges and businesses set up for that purpose. 
And yes, people want clean fiat. Since the crypto is pretty easily convertible to fiat, and its source has been obscured, this accomplishes that. 
Buying real estate in cash doesn't 'Do' anything, you've essentially just placed a huge red flag on yourself as the buyer and the seller. 
The cash still isn't sitting in the financial system, someone has to go deposit a million in cash now and your purchase of the property is going to be recorded as a cash transaction and depending the country you're in etc... it'd be reported. 
If you're in a country that isn't going to report that stuff, you may as well go to a bank there and deposit the cash in a briefcase anyway. 
The idea of using bitcoin as the actual original transaction currency is that there never was any cash. The customer buys their drugs, guns, girls etc... with crypto to begin with and you never have to place funds. 
You can then use as much of your crypto as crytpo to buy other assets or things you need, or convert the crypto back to fiat.
But there's no original cash source you're now concealing. 
@_date: 2019-10-16 15:45:23
The problem with this is it includes non-money money. Like if you own a money market account it counts, but that is you holding a fund of bonds, not the currency. And it includes savings and chequing accounts were the bank only has 10% of your money on hand.   
But Bitcoin can't have non-money money. The entire point of the whole fucking thing is that there isn't any fractional reserve banking system.   
So you can't hit that same number at all. If Bitcoin replaced all Fiat in the world, you've unwound that fractional reserve amplification and multiplication of currency, and you're closer to $ 8 Trillion in currency than $105 Trillion.   
That gets you more to the $400,000 range, not $5 million.

The nonsense is what they're claiming here as 'illicit' 
They trained an algorithm based on very sparse data and used network analysis to created. So what it's ultimately doing is making a determination that most things connected to known bad nodes are 'illicit'
They're also saying the false positive rate is high....so it's identifying 2% but they know most of what it's identifying is being mislabeled and isn't really illicit. 
Basically they made an algorithm that 'alerts' on 2% but 2% isn't really the number and it's based on incomplete and poor original data.

For right now most businesses who accept it immediately convert it.  
So they don't actually price things 'in' Bitcoin. They price them in fiat currency, add a markup and charge that equivalent in Bitcoin, then when they receive it they convert it almost immediately.   
But the longer run answer is eventually you'll have to have the price stabilize and then merchants might be willing to actually price 'in' Bitcoin. A big key too is when businesses can actually pay some of their expenses in Bitcoin too.   
international companies often try to match their foreign currency revenues to foreign expenses and convert the rest, you'll get a similar thing here.

Well, you don't make up for the debt, a switch away from the fractional and reserve based economy would destroy the world's economy basically. 
You can't really 'borrow' bitcoin in the same way, and its deflationary so any interest rates on borrowing would be insane and hugely punitive. 
You're right that there's quadrillions in other assets, but since you can't create the same sort of lending structure and leverage based on BTC you'd end up with a really big compression of that value. 
Most things we call 'money' aren't money. Like there's not much 'Money' in trusts, its assets of other kinds. 
It's hard to imagine a replacement of everything with crypto would increase the wealthiest person's value, it's almost necessarily lower it because there just isn't enough currency to support it. 
We'll have to find some completely different system to build around crypto if it really does move into dominance.

This might be true for small investors. 
Like yeah, I sold most around Xmas but I kept some in, and now that remainder is only worth a few thousand.

But I'm not who matters, its people with a few million left who matter, and they're not just going to say "whatever, I don't care to sell" 
I think for those a drop is obviously a bad thing, but also just any sort of long sideways thing might indicate "Ok, well, this thing is over now" and they'd slowly get out of it without new money flowing in.

Then another $57 Billion in 'Short-Term investment' which you're calling cash too. 
Same thing for 'Warren Buffet' (which I assume means Berkshire Hathaway but you're an idiot)
They have 111 Billion in 'Cash' but that's again only $1.7 Billion in 'Cash' 19 Billion in Money Market, $9.8 billion in Treasury and $81.5 Billion in 'Short Term investment'

For me it'd depend on the market, in some cases new money will raise the price more than its value, in other cases it won't, new money in might even still result in a drop in price.
Marketcap is simply price * quantity in existence. The Price part is all that really matters for the individual investor, but I think Marketcap is a good 'Sanity check' sometimes. 
For a traditional stock Marketcap makes a lot of sense, if gives you some idea how much it would cost to buy the entire company, plus some sort of premium. Like you'll have Amazon buy Whole Foods, and it's value will be the marketcap of the company, plus a premium, in that case 27% to get agreement and the deal goes through. Or Burger King buys Popeye's and pays its Marketcap plus a 20% premium. 
For a "Currency" it makes less sense, because you can't acquire all of a currency and do something with it. But here it still tells you the implied cumulative value of that asset.  
I think people object to it because they think 'But when someone buys or sells a lot the price moves' but it's not measuring market depth... it's measuring implied total value, they're just envisioning the concept incorrectly.

No, it's actually not technically the nature of an ETF to actually hold the product. Many do, but that's not actually a requirement. 
Many ETFs actually just hold contracts instead set to mirror the underlying instead of owning the underlying thing. 
Futures announcements of course happened during a pre-existing rally, then by the time those first contract reached their settlement, it was essentially in free fall. 
And yes, generally introduction of futures on stocks or commodities has coincided with in a year+ or so bullish market.

I think right off the bat, I think the idea it replaces 2/3rd of all currency is laughably ridiculous. 
So I think the fact you view that as pretty reasonable shows we just disagree on a very fundamental level right there. 
And actually Derivatives do make up like 95% of the value of 'the rest' but that's nominal face value of those derivatives, it doesn't represent actual value or anything. People like throwing in a $1.2 Quadrillion figure because that's fun, but it's a bit of a silly measurement, it doesn't reflect reality.
But lets talk about something like a CD... because I think this is a big big misunderstanding people have. 
No, your CD or GIC are not currency. It's a security. 
The currency isn't in that account, the point is they take your money and offer you X% return, and they lend it out at X+3% or whatever. 
So while your chequing account is theoretically 'cash' your CD isn't even pretending to be cash, it's a security you bought. When you redeem it they have to put cash into your account from their accounts. While a normal account its essentially already 'there' 
(Of course there's really 10% fractional reserve capital etc... but there's no transfer of actual funds required)
For the 401k part, you wouldn't have people 'investing' in bitcoin anymore, because you're now talking about a world where Bitcoin is the primary currency in the world. So you wouldn't 'invest in BTC' any more than you 'Invest in USD' in your 401k currently. 
People might have uninvested bitcoin in a 401k, but that's the currency now, not some investment product. You could potentially buy and sell it in futures vs other currencies still in existence, but then that's not holding it either, that's holding a derivative.
Things like Trusts, while the account is 'non-liquid' to the holder, any cash in it is actually liquid, so it's not excluded from M1. But Most trusts also would not hold a lot of actual liquid cash, they'll hold bonds and other assets.
Now the other overall issue is that the fractional reserve banking system isn't possible for BTC, so when/if we move away from the fiat, you're also actually collapsing that system, and as a result that global money supply shrinks. 
No one's even really thought of those mechanisms too much yet because we're so far from it...but how would basic banking work in that context? We don't really know yet, but the idea of banks offering mortgages and stuff wouldn't really be possible in a BTC-dominated system, both because it's completely finite and its a naturally deflationary system.
I think as a last point too, maybe this is just a matter of perspective, but I was saying that even if BTC took over the world and even if it is now $1,000,000+ per coin I guess I'm not calling that 'life changing money' for 0.5 BTC. 
That's a matter of perspective I guess, I guess to some people that is, to other people that's certainly a nice gain, but not like life altering, especially if we're talking about like 20+ years to get to that level of dominance.

I know for some weird fucked in the head reason crypto people don't believe in marketcap because they don't understand what it is and I think because you know it's wrong for some little shitcoins. 
But no, if it's a currency, you'd use Money supply and PPP
M3 Money supply isn't comparable to Bitcoin because bitcoin exists in M2 only. M3 includes non-currency securities, the both doesn't exist in Bitcoin and it doesn't represent the actual dollar supply. 
I'm assuming the 21 Million coins we'll be at, I guess you can remove the 'lost coins' if you like. 
I think well well before $1 million you'd have broken USD, if you hit $1 million you'd essentially be talking about mainstream adoption long long ago. 
But when we say price of $1 million, anyone looking at it economically or financial is talking about it as a fixed date or PPP number, not like 'well if the dollar collapses then it'll be more...' sort of thing. Like for Bitcoin it makes sense to do a measure vs like a 2009 or 2010 dollar.

How would that work...they save money in actual cash? for years and years in only dollar form?
Let's say they had $10,000 in a savings account completely uninvested in anything... 
1) Why?
2) They'll lose what...$100 to $200 a year in its value? 
Is it somehow better to own the thing that moves up or down at least 3&amp; every single day?
That's a trivial 'loss' on an already kind of unrealistic amount of cash for a person in poverty to have...it makes the assumption that the person in poverty has no debt, and didn't invest the money in anything like a bond or term deposit even. 
It's just really weird to me, I know people in person who make this ridiculous 'Inflation is the enemy!' claim, then when you ask their financial situation, they benefit from inflation, same as I do. 
Inflation hurts very wealthy people with passive money, that's the point. Inflation encourages deployment of capital.

Taking a mortgage out on a property you just acquired without an attached debt is essentially an automatic way to get reported by the bank.

It can't be handled the same way as regular money in that nothing can be reversed or recovered. 
The number of cancellations and reversals and recoveries a typical bank does in a day is in the thousands of transactions. 
People every day would just lose everything all at once with no method to recover it.
That's to me the  thing they need to address with this tech. 
The  similar thing is also how groups/companies can own this money. Bitcoin was very much designed to assume singular ownership. Some steps have been made to  make that work for groups but its still super hard.
We've also still got nothing for 'Oh Bill died...I guess his money is just gone now'

In normal AML we have demographics, locations, balances, KYC information, incomes etc.. etc.. if you jusdt ran this on a blockchain you've essentially got 2 wallets, maybe IPs and an amount. So they're just kind of making relationship maps and using that.

Don't use DCA, it is in fact a horrible idea.
Invest in chunks if you have to. But if you have a lump sum to invest today, do not break it up into investments over a long period of time. 
The idea of an 'average cost' is a foolish concept that preys on people's tendency to want to console themselves and chase losses, while also helping financial advisors convince you that having to make installment payments is 'better' which encourages people to invest.
Every trade you make should be considered a separate decision with a separate outcome. 
If I bought 1000 shares of Netflix at $400 then 1000 shares at $300 then I sold 2000 at $375... I made 1 trade with a $75,000 and 1 trade with a $25,000 loss. 
'Averaging Down' did not retroactively make my first decision to buy a good decision. 
If you don't have $10k to buy, and you have to buy because you only have $100 a month available..then you can do it that way. But don't think of it as a 'Averaging' or any other nonsense. It's just a purchase plan, there's no benefits to it. 
Any asset with a positive expected return should not be averaged into, a lump sum is better. If you can do a lump sum, do a lump sum. 
If you can't do a lump sum, then do the $100, but don't worry about your 'lifetime average cost' that's a complete and utter delusion.

No, I owe a fixed number.
Like say I owed $500,000 That stays the same. But the house i bought increases in value and my Salary continues to rise both because of inflation. The Debt doesn't rise, it drops. 
Like lets look at a hyperinflationary country for an extreme example...let's say I owed the bank 500,000 Bolivar.
That might be 10 years wages and then with 1,000,000% inflation happening the very next month that might actually only be a week's worth and bam, my debt I owed is totally gone...but I own the house I bought.  
Deflationary owing would be Terrifying. Imagine you borrowed 100 BTC in 2016 to buy a house.

But its only good advice in retrospect. 
If he thought it was going to crash back down he just shouldn't buy any. 
If you think the Expected Return is positive and you have a lump sum, you should invest the lump sum. 
If you can predict the 'state of the market' and think its going to go down, then don't invest anything.

And in some currencies even though they have like 10,000,000 bills...they don't have 100 bills or coins. They actually do not use the 1 measurement.
So that's exactly what i'm saying the idea of it being '1' when some do not actually use '1' as the smallest increment means you're making it seem significant when it's just not. 
It's just arbitrary comparison of two unrelated units. 
The 2nd point of it is kind of interesting, but we're not really near that point. 
Even if bitcoin got to $5 million per coin...a Satoshi is $0.05 
That's the smallest currency unit in Canada.

DCA is Stupid. 
Did you DCA Because you were financially forced to buy in installments, or because you thought it was a good strategy?
The Concept of 'Averaging' in is a really flawed concept that's been mathematically in disproven in papers since the 1960s. 
If someone do not have the money to invest, go ahead and buy in installments because you have to, nothing wrong with that, but it's not a strategy and it is more beneficial if you have the money to simply invest the money all at once.
If something has a positive expected return, (and if it doesn't, you wouldn't invest in it) then you're better off investing in a lump sum. 
The idea of 'Dollar Cost Averaging' is a myth financial advisors has been selling for decades to convince people that investing a little at a time is better and make them feel better about investing small amounts over long periods of time.

Yeah obviously I mean in terms of a PPP or dollar-equivalent value. 
Everything has to be valued in terms of something else. 
I said in one of my responses here that I was thinking the maximum 0.5 of a bitcoin could reach is essentially 'A good home in a decent sized city' 
Basically a Thing that would cost $700,000 now, I think you'd cap around there for 0.5 a Bitcoin. 
I mean obviously I don't think it'll even get near that in 10 years, but that's like a theoretical max. 
It's a very basic concept at the heart. Currently the currency in the world is all totaled to about $31 Trillion in value. 
If you replace all of that, 100% of it, with BTC instead... its total value would be approximately the equivalent of that $31 Trillion. 
I know you're not in finance or economics or anything, but its very common in those fields to value things in a fixed year vs a basket of goods.
So Essentially what I'm saying if it helps you think of it is the maximum a BTC in like 2030 could reach is the value of $700,000 USD in 2019 if that makes sense to you. 
Now this idea that real estate woulds no longer be a store of value, that's our of left field, why would that go away? I don't understand why you think that houses would retain value.
Are you conflating the idea that since Bitcoin isn't inflationary that things won't increase in value? 
Generally real estate is bought for appreciation and income purposes, not usually a store of value thing only. 
We should certainly hope that the rise of BTC wouldn't lead to a lack of ability to build wealth in a home, that would be such a disaster to the middle class and lower class throughout the world.
You should actually have higher appreciation on almost all assets if you have a deflationary currency, or else you're breaking the CAPM curve somehow.

Ok, didn't know Gates started Microsoft in 1913 or that WalMart began in the depression.
It';s not that rich people don't remain rich, it's that they have to INVEST THE MONEY to remain rich. 
If it was deflationary they remain rich by literally just holding the currency. 
Also it means rich people in new industries inevitably pass them.

Yes inflation is a tax on all wealth.
The more wealth, the more it got taxed.
People who get the money and spend it pay next to nothing in 'inflation tax' 
1 million invested in the stock market in 1919 indeed would be worth $13 Billion today.... But that's much less in 1919 Dollars. 
Things have a rate of return, and inflation eats some of that. 
So to go from the 1 Million to 14 billion in 100 years is a 10% rate of return, but if inflation is 3%, the real rate of return is 7%, about $800 Million
Inflation Ate about 13.2 Billion of that 14
Inflation cuts that rate of return, that's the entire point. 
For something like a Mortgage, we have different risk profiles...they get their guaranteed 3% but I get leverage on a riskier thing...they get their deal, and I get mine. It's symbiotic, not outsmarting.

Definitionally it's worse though, since it's based on USD itself.  
So any problems the USD has, it also has, then it has its own problems on top of those ones. 
So just by necessity it has to be a bit worse. 
And then in reality of course it only can be used on a very small controlled set of places and while they're both 'created by private corporations' the size and stability of those things are different.

Yes, of course its too volatile
The consumer is the one deciding to pay in weird internet magic money, the vendor is willing to accept that, they but they aren't interested in taking that risk, they're not speculating on or keeping the bitcoin.
You pay your bitcoin at the current exchange rate to USD plus a fee, which people really only do at this point because they think it's 'cool' or something. 
The merchant just then takes that currency and convert it to USD. 
Why would a merchant take the risk on these currencies? Companies don't speculate on stuff like that, they control risks and hedge them.

"If someone do not have the money to invest, go ahead and buy in installments because you have to, nothing wrong with that, but it's not a strategy and it is more beneficial if you have the money to simply invest the money all at once."
Don't call it 'Dollar Cost Averaging' when they just mean 'buy as you can afford it' it's misleading and bad math and finance.

On the first point, right. The US Dollar has kind of a shell value, Tether makes a smaller, weaker shell supported by a much weaker corporation. So it's just by definition less reliable, it's an extra point of failure.
On the 2nd point, I can however just have actual Dollars. Tether can't do that. And again all Tether's money is in the same system you don't like...and because it's Tether's money it's not allowed in most places the normal USD can be. 
They have to put the money in obscure banks, can't transfer it through mainstream channels etc.. 
Nowadays it's not the case that USD can only be transferred within special banking networks, it can be moved by any number of third party providers, most subject to less constraints than Tether is. 
Inventing dumb distinction like "Well , that's not 'bank money'" is pretty idiotic. Tether's money backing it is in a bank. 
I maintain exactly what I've said Tether has all the weaknesses of Fiat plus some new weaknesses.

The idea of a 'store of value' is something that keeps its value even in the face of a decline in other assets or a dilution of currency value.
So if Bitcoin is the dominant currency in the world, it's sort nonsensical to say its a store of value, it would be like saying just the US Dollar is a store of value. It's just the standard currency, not an investment or store of some kind. 
They're talking about it 'capturing wealth' from these other assets, not from growth in the economy or something. I'm saying that makes no sense. The value of bitcoin won't take value from or replace real estate or commodities etc... those things will still be there and have value, their value might be measured in Bitcoin if its the dominant currency, but it doesn't like 'capture' that. That's a nonsense line of thought.
Again, tell me the actual mechanism that it 'captures value' from non-liquid assets like real estate or derivatives or something. 
Like give me that math. 'cause it's just a nonsense concept, it's like saying a Circle captures the radius of racoons. It's just a nonsense statement.

Future loans of course would be bigger, but your income would also be bigger. 
But with BTC, you couldn't get a loan at all, right? 'cause you'd have to pay the interest plus the actual capital gain of the currency
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:13:05
That is of course factored in CPI.
M1, M2 and M3 are money supply obviously, but they don't do much to measure inflation or value of that money. 
You can know the supply increased, but not its relative value or impact as a result of the increase.
like obviously after the 2008 Crisis Money supply massively spiked, but inflation didn't because the velocity and use of the money didn't impact the value as much as its increase in supply.
@_date: 2019-06-30 02:45:55
I guess I'm in Canada, so no, we don't pay capital gains on some things, like a house. 
You've gotten loans In Bitcoin? Like long term loans, or do you mean like you borrowed it to short it or something?
I'm thinking of the math of it... Right now if I borrowed $500,000 in USD I maybe pay 3% interest, inflation is like 2%... over 20 years I pay back $664,000ish and I'm clear on my debt.
Now lets say i was making $100,000 a year when I started and my salary grew by inflation, im making about $150,000 a year by the end, I can easily afford these payments of $2800 a month
But let's say I borrow Bitcoin... $500,000 worth of BTC borrowed. Can I get that at 3% interest? Probably not, no. But lets even pretend I can. 
Now It's deflationary though, so how's that affect things? now if you borrowed this $500,000 worth of BTC in July of 2016 you'd have borrowed 740 coins and you'd owe that back now... 
But lets pretend its today and BTC doesn't spike, it grows at 10% a year instead. You borrow 45 coins today and your salary is $100,000 a year or 9 coins a year.   
So you pay the 3% and each year your bitcoin salary deflates, you make 10% less each year. 
At the end of the term you owe several millions dollars worth of bitcoin and your salary has dropped to 1.1 BTC a year, You can no longer afford your payments and are destitute. 
And thsat's only at 10%....BTC deflates but much much more than 10% a year so far.

That's almost the only possible time you could have chosen for Berkshire where it'd be similar, you intentionally picked the year after a market crash.
Berkshire is double the market in the past 12 months
If you took it from before the crash, 2007:
It massively outperforms it
If you take it to the maximum on google:
4000% to 800%
You essentially cherry picked to only time frame you could have picked.
Also for some reason you're linking Berkshire STOCK with his return? Why?
You generally compare portfolio performance to the market index, why are you comparing the value of a stock to the index? that makes no sense. 
The company doesn't only manage portfolios and 100% of its stock price is portfolios.

@_date: 2019-06-23 05:41:12
I think the problem is that's not true.
The Total Output volume includes your 'change'
So if i send you 0.1 BTC, but I have 2.5 in that block, it gives you 0.1 and gives me back my 2.4 BTC the output says 2.5 but i only transferred 0.1
The title reads :
Output Value
The total value of all transaction outputs per day (includes coins returned to the sender as change).
So output volume says June 21st was 1.9 Million BTC or $20 Billion give or take
But the other chart
Estimated Transaction Value
The total estimated value of transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain (does not include coins returned to sender as change).
This excludes 'change' and its only 206,000 for the same day, or 2.1 Billion
The actual amount sent in a day averages only 10% of the 'Output' 
90% of the bitcoin in the output never changed hands or moved wallets.

The fact that there is no governance and that security is 100% in everyone's own hands is the thing that makes it unusable on that scale.

People actually living on it are either the crazy early adopters who are now rich over this stuff anyway and have thousands of coins or something, or they're people really making an effort to conceal their payments for whatever reason.
So it does have a pretty widespread criminal or money laundering use, and those people are willing to accept the volatility in order to avoid scrutiny or make it harder. 
But yeah, no one is getting a $5,000 month salary, converting it to BTC and trying to pay their day to day bills and expenses in Bitcoin, or at least they'd be insane to. 
One thing no one really says though for the Crypto-rich people though, is its actually pretty hard right now to convert huge amounts of cryptocurrency back into Fiat and actually withdraw that fiat. 
If you have now like $35 million in coins, it can be really hard to actually liquidate and pull all that into a fiat account, there's often huge delays in cashing out, limits on how much can be withdrawn in a month from various markets etc.. such that you actually want to find ways to use the BTC itself to pay for things.

Hodl is holding the currency.  That's M1
Sorry it's super clear you've got no financial background. 
A long term deposit isn't just taking your money and putting it in a bank for a long time. 
You're buying an instrument, the bank or whoever takes your money and gives you a deposit certificate instead. 
You don't have the currency anymore, you lent it to them and they'll pay you a higher rate of interest for agreeing to lend it to them for a fixed period of time.
Money market is where you buy a fund of short term bonds. Again you've spent your currency and you now own these safe short term bonds, then later you sell those to get your currency back. 
HODLing isn't buying anything or lending your money out, that's just an account with your money in it. That's M1 Money Supply. 
That's like a chequing account or even cash under your mattress. 
Lost bitcoin isn't like a long term deposit, it's like currency someone lost or was destroyed unknowingly. 
If you lost $500 in a fire, or your grandpa buried it in the backyard, that's like Lost Bitcoin. 
The system is still accounting for it, its exists, its on the balance sheet. But it's not recoverable. 
But that is still part of M1 Money Supply.
M1 = Currency, either cash or in electronic cash form currency.
M2 = Near currency. These are extremely liquid but not quite 'cash' this now includes savings accounts or very short term money market instruments. These aren't 'cash' but have no time locked in component. 
M3 = Near near currency. This now include things on a time lock, CDs, GICs, Repos etc... 
So, Can Bitcoin be in M1? Yes, all bitcoin is liquid so Bitcoin definitely falls into M1.
Can Bitcoin be M2? No, not really but a tiny bit debateable. There's not really any Bitcoin money market instruments. There are like kiiind of 'Bitcoin Savings Accounts'  It's a bit weird because they like pay some interest to use your hot bitcoin to lend against cold held assets. So It's not really a savings account, but they do call them savings accounts. They're really small and rare though too. But lets say yes, a tiny fraction of bitcoin is M2. 
Can bitcoin be M3? No. There's no term deposits, there's no locked in funds, there's no CDs etc... M2 is like 99% no, M3 is 100% no. 
I know I'm essentially not even talking to you anymore, you're dug in, you don't understand this and frankly you don't want to.

@_date: 2019-06-27 04:14:44
No, I understand the actual things you're talking about, they're a little bit wrong but I get you don't like banking.
I think you don't quite appreciate actually how much money does exist as physical cash, about 40% of M1 is actually in physical form. But I get you're trying to say you think physical currency is harder to transfer. But the USD in physical form physically moving outside of banks is a huge staple in the world economy. 
But I'm saying Tether's Dollars are IN that banking system. So any problems it has, Tether has. 
But on your points about physical versus 'bank money' I'm more saying...what in the hell are you talking about? Like not in terms of you're wrong... but in terms of...What are you responding to with that point? 
No one said anything that had anything to do with whether or not there was a difference between physical and non-physical dollars. 
The point is you can have Dollars outside the banking system in the form of physical currency. You Cannot have Tether outside the banking system because Tether's Dollars are in that system. 
If those dollars are seized, frozen, flagged etc... then Tether isn't backed by USD and that's the end of it. 
So you're taking this good idea of crypto, and then putting the collateral to the entire thing into the hands of any bank to refuse the money or any government to seize the money.

I actually even addressed that point in like the next sentence. 
A CD isn't a security 'because' they loan out the money, they do loan out the money, but that's not why it's a security. 
It is a security because it's an investment of money and is classified as a security. In the U.S., securities are defined as contracts in which one party invests money with another and expects to make a return. That's what a CD is. 
I don't think bitcoin is worthless, not sure how you got from Point A to B there, but you could argue that Bitcoin is a security.
I'm not convinced about that argument since i think there's no underlying ownership or rate of return contracted on, but I don't think its really a 'currency' either. It think its more a digital commodity right now.

Bitcoin is not anonymous, it's almost the exact opposite, it's completely transparent.
The blockchain tracks where literally everything you own came from and where they got it from and where they got it from forever.
Your identity could then be found out in a million ways, from IP addresses to actually giving ID to marketplaces, to making transactions in physical locations or accepting transaction with other people you know, and of course the moment anything is converted to any sort of fiat, that has to go somewhere. 
If you went from account XYZ to ABC to XYT, we'd still be able to see that's how the money moved. 
There were services called 'tumblers' which tried to launder money and send it back out to other addresses, but because its all transparent you can always reconstruct how they did it.

Right, that's what the entire fucking thread is about you idiot, jesus fucking christ. 
All currency in the world is worth $31 Trillion right now.
It bitcoin took ALL of that value and other currencies completely and totally went away, that's in the ball park of what it would be worth in comparative value. 
So if ALL of the current currencies died off and Bitcoin is the one and only currency, 0.5 of a bitcoin is worth about $600,000-$700,000 in today's value Basically it'd be worth like a decent condo in a decent city.

Unless you're obscenely wealthy, you should want a decent inflation to happen, it erodes 'old money' and lower debt for people in debt. 
It seems like this is a main thing for people who love Bitcoin, I can't for the life of me figure out WHY it's important to most people. Do you have $50 million sitting in Cash in a closet?

"participating in the market" does not matter. Not all shares of stock or dollars or gold bars are 'participating in the market' either. They still exist and they count. 
M3 Is investments. It is long term deposits, money market, repos and a few other liquids. it is not currency. It is liquid things currency has been exchanged for.
That categorically does not exist in Bitcoin and if bitcoin ever became the global currency the M3 would be in addition to the M2 coins, not part of them.
M3 is not part of a currency's supply. Period.

I'd argue you can do that with or without the governance system. 
  
They control cash already, and there's no way to physically control its flow, they just get you at entry and exit points.  
Cash you can at least spend more places so you could live on cash only. If the government banned BTC you couldn't really live off the grid on BTC. At least not a normal life.

I'm ok with $36 Trillion, I'm getting a few different numbers depending on sources 36 is higher, but i'm seeing $31 some places so I'm ok with $36T, but those are within the same order of magnitude, you'd be at 1.2 to 1.7 Million per bitcoin.   
But why would you include non-liquid things?
Bitcoin only exists in liquid form. 
There isn't 'currency' in 401ks and stuff, there's securities which can be sold later for currency, but it's not like new currency. There's not 90 Trillion in dollars there, there's 90 trillion 'worth' of stuff.
So we're only talking about replacing the liquid part. 
Gold is only $7.7 Trillion, that doesn't make a huge different, and again...you're not 'replacing' gold, the gold still exists. So why would you include that?
And Derivatives, more extreme case, but same thing, derivatives aren't currency, That's just the potential value of exercise of all derivatives...but that value is exchanged in commodities and stocks and currency itself. Derivatives are not currency, if you replaced fiat with BTC, you'd still have derivatives on those other things, they wouldn't be replaced. 
All that said though, we're getting in the ballpark of the same ending... which is if BTC actually replaced 100% of all currency both physical and in banks you're only at 1.2 to 1.7 Million per bitcoin. 
So even in that absoultely insane and unlikely proposition, we're still looking at a non-life altering amount of money for 0.5 BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-29 13:00:01
I agree with the idea that things, commodities and products are often 'deflationary' like they take up less of CPI over time...because of course as technology improves making and getting things is cheaper. 
I'm not sure i get the relationship though, it makes a cute bumper sticker, but what's the underlying concern there?
We can generally see the hyper inflation countries does poorly, deflationary countries do poorly...and ones with like 1-4% inflation seem to grow.
@_date: 2019-12-19 16:25:05
Yeah, the best scale for that is just the actual dollar value without logging it, it looks like something that hit a high 2 years ago, dropped 85%+ tried to recover, made it to like 50% of it former value and fell another 40% trending down still.
If you just don't manipulate the data at all, it looks terrible in a graph. Ends up looking like every little startup that took a bit to get going, got overhyped, then dropped and settled in a at a more reasonable valuation or went bankrupt.

Dollar Cost Averaging has been proven incorrect for decades now, there's papers disproving the math dating back to like 1967.  
If you have to buy in increments because you don't have the money all at once that's perfectly fine, but you're not "Dollar Cost Averaging" you're simply buying different amounts at different prices at the point you can afford it.  
If you have $50,000 to put in and you think it's going to go up, you are dumb to 'Dollar Cost Average'
If however you only have $500 a month to put in, go ahead and buy it monthly. But do not delude yourself into thinking this is a good 'strategy' or gives some advantage.  
This doesn't just apply to bitcoin either. Any asset of any kind with a positive expected return should not be 'dollar cost averaged' into.   
If you genuinely think you're coming in at an All time high...don't buy it... wait. If you don't think it's a high...don't wait.   
This myth he's propagating where you need to be seasoned or that 'most beginners enter at the high' is straight up moronic, unjustified and totally incorrect. 
He then goes to tables where he cherry picked dates specifically that would make his thing work...He intentionally picked the very top of the market in 2014 and 2017 to skew it on purpose. 
This is so deceptive and stupid.
@_date: 2019-06-11 19:59:15
You keep going back and forth, are we in the current world, or a world where Bitcoin is the dominant global currency?
If Bitcoin is the global currency, then it cannot possibly have a rate of return higher than any investment assets. That's basic CAPM, the currency isn't invested, it's the currency, everything else must have a higher expected rate of return. 
The Wealth affect in North America is almost totally based on real estate prices. 
If people already can't afford their own homes where you're at, switching to Bitcoin as the primary currency and making it impossible to get mortgages certainly won't help with that. 
I think people keep thinking of bitcoin as something to over throw the existing rich people...but it's actually a way for them to lock in their advantage by getting rid of inflation on their wealth. Unless someone is an early adopter they'll end up switching after major gains are made and the people with the most assets will still be better off.

You could also say It's down 65% from the high 2 years ago and that's factual too. It's kind of neat that December 15th and 16th were the high point and the low point exactly 1 year apart, probably coincidental, but neat.

This idea that 'money will flow into bitcoin' we're already stipulating that...if 100% of all money in the world flowed into Bitcoin, it's still capped at about $1.5Million per coin.

That's weirdly like the opposite, he's talking about buying a lump sum and cashing out a little each time it doubles.

His thing has them all spaced 0.67 apart so it creates a predictive 'pattern' he's trying to use to show it'll be at some price.   
But if you change the aspect ratio a little bit, now it.s 0.82x then 0.72x it's not a matching distance anymore so it breaks his implied logic that it'll repeat.

I've been involved in this for years, and the only times I ever 'used' Bitcoin to buy something was when it was forced, like a conference that required you to buy a pass with Bitcoin or something.

@_date: 2019-12-19 03:09:26
No, he admitted it, he seems to genuinely know it was incorrect.
And your example intentionally uses two lines with a relationship to each other embedded in their definition.
That's not the case here. Also even in your own case, the relationship of the angles between x=y, x=2y and x=3y still are not consistent if you change the graph.
The LINES have a relationship. the ANGLES do not help you predict.
If X=y is 45 and x=2y is 22.5 then x=3y is 15
Then the ratios are 0.5 and 0.67... so I'd predict x=? What's the pattern we've created?
You can't use the \*angle\* to then predict a next line.
We also have the fundamental 'Pattern Recognition problem'
Let's say you have x=y, x=2y and x=3y
Now, what's the 4th value? The rule might be the it's x=4y....but x=5y is also consistent with the pattern.
1, 2, 3, 4 is a valid series..we add 1 each tick.
1, 2, 3, 5 is a valid series, we add the previous 2 digits
1, 2, 3, 6 is a valid series, we add all previous digits
1, 2, 3, 3.75 is a valid series... the growth drops by half each step...100%, 50%, 25%...  
There's a huge number of valid continuations to the series, so these 2 or 3 data points cannot be used to meaningfully predict a next value
So you're wrong on the angles, you're wrong on the trend, you're wrong on the pattern.

You should indeed keep reading that, you'll find the issue people are pointing out to you eventually.
Kind of a bad look for a 'Research Firm' to put out something where it's clear they don't understand outputs. 
Here's a visualization because you're clearly not a 'reader' 
Input is 10.89 BTC, output is 10.89 BTC
How much was Spent? 
You total all outputs you consider all of it spent, but how much is it really? 
How about this one?
or this one?
I don't think you know how to read these, and others have pointed that out as well.
So instead of you learning that you just say 'It's all spent' and consider it all a transaction, that's why your number is 9 times too high. 
I think you now understand the area of ignorance you have.

I really wish a story like that would link the report they are exclusively talking about.   
But since they didn't:  
 [   
I think the story left out a sense of scope. For BCH, the cost was only about 4%. I think that's within reason, like if you preferred BCH for speculation, the hassle of mining BTC, then converting it to BCH constantly and having to switch mining from one thing to another periodically might not be worth the hassle to get an extra 4% return, so its explainable mostly by laziness and not aiming for absolute peak efficiency.   
For BSV though, they're talking about 17% of revenue being lost, that's a lot more unjustifiably irrational.    
It's more extreme what you get to GPU mining. If you consider Ethereum the 'standard' since it has the most mining, some coins like Ravencoin get you 93% more return and Metaverse earning you only 65% return, but people still mine it.
@_date: 2019-12-18 14:42:39
That's not true.   
The best example is the 0.67 he shows with the angle shot. It is only like that because he drew the graph specifically with a height/width ratio he did. 
You can leave the exact same numbers and date, but simply make the visual representation taller, or wider, and the 'angles' he calculate no longer hold.   
So if you put the exact same data into different graphing software, it'd change.   
There's no pattern in the first place, it's a physical manipulation of a picture.

There's issues with the others too, like in the 1st you're implying a pattern off literally 1 cycle.  
But the aspect ratio one was the funniest, and I think would be the easiest for other people to understand why it's silly.   
I get that there's a 'pattern' of rising after a halving...but its happened twice.
@_date: 2019-12-16 17:50:46
That doesn't make any sense.   
Dec 15th 2018 was the lowest point in over 2 years, with the last time it was below that being September 15th, 2017.
It has mathematical significance simply for being the lowest point in over 2 years.

No, that's not true.   
You already did the math, not only are they not all equal, they don't even move in the same direction.   
depending how you move it, sometimes it equal, something it goes down, sometimes it goes up, sometimes it with go down then up...   
If B/A = 0.83
C/B = 0.75
 then what is D/C ?   
What's the trend this is following? If you move the original line in the graph, it's 0.76 but whats the trend then?  
If you didn't already have the line drawn, how would you draw D? Where would you?  
 Even the guy who made the graph now acknowledges it's nonsense.

They are obligated to tell him his account is being closed. But they're not really supposed to say why. 
That's horrible business practice of course, but that's what the laws on this stuff require. 
It's stupid in this case, but the reason is obvious. If you found like, the mafia or a terrorist group laundering money and closed their accounts, it would be very stupid to tell them 'We caught you because...' since that gives them tips on how to avoid being caught in the future.
It's silly in a case like this where it's just online gambling, but the same rule applies.

But you've proven it's NOT a fixed ratio. 
He showed lines all with a ratio of 0.67 to then 'predict' that the next point would also be at 0.67  
But in your math there, it's clear that changing the shape of the graph changes the angles so they are not consistent. 0.83, 0.75....  now doesn't 'predict' anything. His line is at 0.76 but on this new graph...why? That doesn't have a linear or predictable relationship of any kind.

Do you think if the banks went away there'd be no fossil fuels? And what do you mean by 'Contribute'? 
This is a child-like understanding of things. It doesn't matter what the monetary system is, those companies will exist and be able to get funding, it doesn't make a single bit of difference if they're funded by dollars or bitcoin, except that bitcoin consumes more energy thereby making the problem worse.

Hrm, so you're saying if we use scales we feel like using coupled with points chosen to suit ours needs...and then making sure the height and width of the graph lets us use angles we desire...that we can show correlations and patterns where none genuinely exist?  
That's pretty cool.   
How long does it take to make these things fit? The angle one is the funniest.

I'm trying to show you can just make up anything you want.  
But yes, stocks can have IPOs, SPOs, Stock buybacks etc... if you've never heard of a stock lockup...maybe like, google 'stock lockup'?  
I obviously mean there's no precedent outside of crypto, and 'twice' is not a great representative pattern. 
I gave more examples in another post... but if I tell you I have a series for you.... "1, 2, ...." 
You cannot tell me the next number, 3 is valid, 4 is valid, 1 is valid.   
It's hard to say with a straight face that something the happened twice in 7 years will happen again, especially when the way it happened those two times don't even look that similar.   
Also the fact that the same 'pattern' occurred the first 3.5 years without the halving reduction in the first place...   
Becomes like watching a team win, then putting on your special jersey, watching them win twice more and saying 'must be the jersey' . You get pretty close to Lisa's Tiger repelling rock.  
I could also say that bitcoin hits a new high once per US election.   
Also the concept of 'until the halving' is dumb too, both halvings happened in the middle of 1 year+ bull markets anyway, it's not like price was dropping before the halving and it changed...it was going up both times already and just continued up.   
I'm not predicting it will go up or down (I am actually predicting It'll go up I guess or I wouldn't own some)   
but I'm saying this charting is literally the dumbest thing ever and you could make any chart say whatever the fuck you want by cherry picking the stat you want and scaling the chart how you want.

There are programs now used for AML that look at distances to 'known bad' nodes.

That's the point though. He shows the relationship as equal. His whole premise is 'The ratio between the 2 angles is equal...so i'll predict the 4th line based on that'  
But if you change the sizing, they're not equal any more. The actual relationship changes and they neither match nor do they even move in a linear way, one goes down, the next goes up. The 1st two angles can no longer predict the 3rd one. 
So it proves there wasn't a relationship in the first place, it was only there because of how the graph was drawn to begin with.

In other words there's no pattern and it's 100% reliant on the scale you use.  
The trend never actually 'happened' it's only based on the shape of the graph and the scale used.
@_date: 2019-12-19 16:51:09
The easiest is you just wouldn't. Do we account for that in literally any other type of graph? There's no real precedent for a future known reduction in an input like that. So using the halving period to denote what 'cycle' is is just a huge assumption to begin with that isn't really justified by anything.   
I think you'd actually just use total supply instead of flow.   
Relying on halving is a way to try and say the input is coming down, but you could instead just show that actual supply increases over time. Or you could use some sort of user growth metric, the growth in the number of wallets has slowed a lot, unique addresses are down, the actual influx of new investment dollars has slowed a lot, the number of alternatives to direct investment in it have increased, the number of daily transactions has gone down etc... it's pretty easy to demonstrate that new demand is dropping faster than new supply so you could use that.   
You get to choose what to include or exclude, you can paint a grim hopeless future, or a bright shiny one. All you have to do is imply a pattern where there's no evidence one exists.
@_date: 2019-12-19 17:58:42
But it isn't a reduction in supply, it's a reduction in the increase of the supply.   
There's obviously some founding for the logic behind that...but it's clearly predicated on the balance between that supply and the demand.   
If demand stayed the same... then supply is still rising. It's rising less than it was rising, but it's rising. Then you'd expect a price drop over time, not an increase.   
And could it have been going up for over a year in anticipation of a thing? That's a pretty big stretch, but...maybe?   
But since we're apparently trying to claim these patterns are repeating......why isn't it repeating now?  Both previous bull markets started over a year before the halving.  
We're 6 months away in a Bear market. So we're already breaking the 'pattern' people are relying on happening.
@_date: 2019-04-18 13:59:48
So then you agree it's a completely separate and unrelated topic to whether or not BTC mining consumes a lot of energy?
@_date: 2019-04-16 19:04:15
That doesn't have anything whatsoever to do with whether or not bitcoin uses a lot of energy. 
Those 2 things have nothing to do with each other, Bitcoin existing doesn't have anything to do with finding alternative energy or not. 
BTC does consume energy mining, that's not a 'misinformed' position and this argument holds no basis and isn't even an argument.

Yes, if it's in Singapore, Singapore's laws also apply
If the Casino is operating from Singapore, it must follow Singapore's laws. 
If the customer is in the US, they must obey American law.
No, Singapore's laws do not 'override' US law or vice versa. They both apply severally. 
US law is however fairly unique in that US law is largely extraterritorial, there's some things Americans are not allowed to do in another country even if it's legal in the country they are visiting. (Bribery, Age of consent etc...)
But in this case if the person is in the US anyway, US law applies for sure. There's no 'overriding' those laws.

Buying bonds IS investing.

Actually the world isn't going through tough times, the economy is generally booming world wide. Cherry picking a few companies in the same industry and noting they dropped is kind of a dumb. comparison.   
The S&amp;P 500 is up 2% this year... the market as a whole is fine of course you can find a few stocks that sucked.    
And If someone said the internet wasn't going anywhere, obviously they were idiots, that was never, literally never, the predominant opinion.   
But internet stocks were in a huge bubble and crashed. It doesn't mean the internet died, it means the stocks were overvalued.
The same with crypto... it dropped 83%. That's a bubble bursting. Even if later on it turns out there's some use for crypto, that was a bubble. 
@_date: 2018-03-02 19:45:28
I think that's also just plain an error to begin with, doesn't look like the coin ever did actually trade at that price. 
For sites like this they could put some sort of filter where if volume is under X% of the float, then don't register its marketcap. 
Like in the top 100 currencies volume is like 2-4% of Marketcap in 24 hours.

15-20% is massive. 
So lets use that as an example..if BTC was a guaranteed 15-20% per year for decades to come...why would I ever invest money in a stock or bond or open a new business or anything? 
It the world's main currency somehow gained 15%-20% a year, the world's economy would halt cold in its tracks from lack of investment. 
It's also ridiculous to think this would be literally the world's only currency, there's always going to be something else, even if it was just gold or something. 
If you think you need 100% of the Money supply BEFORE it's stable..then it's already a failure.

Unfortunately a lot of the US wage stagnation is largely a political problem I think, many of developed and developing countries are pushing wages upwards and adding higher skill jobs.

@_date: 2018-03-12 22:09:20
Well in normal life, in an inflationary economy, it doesn't. 
You're facing 2% inflation but maybe 4% interest, so it costs you money. 
But what's happened over higher inflation periods that happen is the inflation can beat out your interest rates in some years, lowering the value of that principle.
So with high debt and higher inflation, the inflation can be very helpful to you.  I will add the caveat though that this is obviously with a locked-in interest rate. 
WW2 debt for instance would be issued in like 30 year bonds at a fixed rate, so when inflation rises beyond that rate, they end up better off. Would be the same if you have a 5 or 10 year locked in low rate then have inflation and rates rise.

But what locks that in? 
There's no standard BTC price, many markets don't even have a USD/BTC trading pair if they only do Crypto/Crypto. 
Also even on the same market is can vary... the BCC/BTC trading pair on Binance values BTC at $10,285 right now, but the BCD/BTC pair values it at $5099 at the same time.
Even if you restrict to BTC/USD only, You've got as wide as $7553 on Bitinka and $8904 on OkCoin.

No, it isn't. I mean it's slightly different rates, and its a different currency. But no, an individual or even a company or bank cannot borrow money at a rate lower than the UK government borrows it at.

No that's the growth of a company, that's not price to earnings. 
You don't mean they earned 2500%, you mean the stock price grew that much. But amazon is a profitable company. It's got a very high PE ratio...over 100... but it's not infinite. 
Tesla might be a better example, but they make physical products with large assets, so that's not like an internet company with no assets losing money and being worth billions like in the 90s.

There's a number that do have insurance agreements, but yes it's largely an unregulated space.
But that's why everyone will always tell you, do not hold your crypto on a market. 
So I can make trades on Bitfinex or Binance or whatever, then immediately I move off of it. Deposit your crypto, buy/sell/whatever and withdraw. 
But on this Robinhood thing, you can't. They're just saying they're holding it for you. You can't deposit Crypto on to it, you can't withdraw it. 
So in reality, you don't own it. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:37:57
But...you don't own any bitcoin when you trade with them. They own it all. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:39:41
Yes, you could say the exact same thing about Bitcoin and essentially every Crypto...their prices are completely correlated. And that's 100% true. They ARE correlated, of course they are. 
But no, it's not necessarily true on a day to day basis, it's just true over longer time scales. 
No, it's not gibberish. 
No one in their right mind would claim that a 5% rise in Tether would result in a 5% rise in Bitcoin. That makes zero sense, one is a hundred times larger than the other. 
The two aren't even similar, if Tether caused a $1 billion increase in Bitcoin, it might come from a 50% increase in Tether, but lead to a 1% increase to bitcoin. 
Doing it as a percentage to percentage is insane. It's like saying this Bucket helps fill the ocean... even if it does, you'd never notice it if you tried to compare a % difference every time you dumped in a bucket. 
Also by doing it by percentage you drastically drastically overweight Early Jan and Feb 2017 and you drastically underweight November and December 2017.   
It's just not statistically valid in any way. Tether rising by 100% from 6 Million to 12 Million obviously has less of an impact than it rising from $1 Billion to 1.2Billion... but 6MM to 12MM is 100% and  1B to 1.2B is 20%. That's not in any way fair...you've now made it so larger dollar values are punished in your analysis. 
It just makes no sense, and its non-sense to the point I think the writer knew it was nonsense when they wrote it. 
Lets use a slightly different analogy. You put a balloon in swimming pool half filled with water and submerge it. 
We know as the balloon is inflated, it will displace more water and the pool water level will rise. 
Say the Ballon displaces 1 Litre and I add air, increasing it to 2 Litres... that's a 100% gain, but the pool is full of 1,000 Litres. 
The Balloon gained 100% but the pool gains 0.1%
Later say my balloon is now 100 Litres displacement of air. I add 10% more to the balloon, this adds about 0.9% to the pool. 
If I added 100% after it was 100 Litres, it adds about 9% to the pool. 
100% at a tiny size was 90 times smaller than 100% at a larger size. 
I've intentionally ignored the nominal size, only focusing on the percentage gain, and I'd come to the conclusion that the balloon seemed to have no consistent correlation to the pool growth. 
If you randomly increased or decreased the balloon by 1 litre every day, the pool would increase or decrease by 1 litre every day... you'd have a perfect 1 to 1 correlation. But if you measured the PERCENTAGE gain of both every day, you'd come to the conclusion the correlation was almost non-existent. 
That's what this person did.

I think once its deflationary, it's not really a currency in a sense, it might be an investment vehicle of some kind, but I think if the value of it goes up over time its always incenting you to not spend and not exchange it, I think it's self defeating in the long run. 
You could have deflationary things, most investments certainly hope to be 'deflationary' but I think it's another asset class at that point really.

@_date: 2018-02-05 23:11:34
I think doing it by percentile helps dwarf the affect though.
When you start the year 2017, the total value of Tether is only 0.03% of the value of Bitcoin, by the end it's 1% of its value.
I don't think you are trying to control for scale, you're actually trying to see if the growth rate in Tether is correlated to a multiplicative gain to Bitcoin.
We don't expect a 1% gain in one to correspond to a 1% gain in the other. You'd be looking for where a $10 Million gain in one leads to a $100 Million gain in the other.
Making it percentages doesn't control for scale, it enhances the scale. The move from $6 million to 12 million is a 100% gain, if that led to a $120 million increase to Bitcoin though, that's only a 0.3% increase in Bitcoin.
Percentages over this period amplifies the scale problem, it doesn't reduce it. This is because Tether was so small at the beginning of this period that it's initial gains will be huge when Bitcoin's are small, then get smaller over time.

I've done a couple withdrawals from Quadriga, both in the 5k range, and both took about 15 days to arrive. 
The complete date is when they process it, but then it's going to some other bank in Australia, FinConnect, before eventually hitting your bank. 
I'm sure the advice isn't useful at this point, but to actually have a deposit on something relying on Bitcoin payment sources to be reliable is insane. 
People have to stop trusting these markets and stuff as if they're banks or financial institutions of some kind. They're fly-by-night things that could close or steal your money with no recourse at any time. 
It's quite possible Quadriga doesn't have your money, I assume they lend out most deposits and then if there's a lot of withdrawal requests they don't really have it.

Inflation actually is good for normal people because normal people don't hold large cash assets. 
Take some average 30 y/o North American, They've got a $300,000 Mortgage and get paid whatever $75,000 and have maybe a small investment account, maybe even still owe student loans if they're an American. But the one thing they definitely don't have is a bunch of cash. 
Their income should inflate, even without a promotion or anything, the value of their home will inflate all else being equal, and the value of that mortgage will dilute. 
If you hold any significant amount of debt, you should want pretty high inflation so that your debt will become smaller compared to relative incomes and the thing securing the debt.
(People often view inflation as bad because they think of their salary as a fixed number, while only costs inflate, though this is more a perception issue and it can be tough to detangle it from small scale conditions, you've got one person who does stagnate while another people gets a 25% raise etc... )
This is also why it's good for governments, things like debt from World War 2 eventually become insignificant. if there wasn't inflation, you'd almost never recover from those costs. 
For banks, I think its basically a neutral. They make money off the spread between the interest rate and inflation, whether inflation was 0% or 10% they could still put a rate at 4% or 14% accordingly. 
Banks obviously don't want especially super high inflation since it does devalue cash/cash equivalent reserves they must carry, but any inflation rate within a reasonable range is basically fine, and it would be fine at 0% too. 
The ones inflation punishes, and who it essentially rightfully should punish is holders of cash and near cash wealth. If you don't actively invest or deploy your resources in a way that makes a return, then you won't beat inflation and you'll diminish in wealth.
This is generally a good thing, because you don't want wealthy people to be able to maintain that wealth by sitting on it undeployed and uninvested. They should only be able to maintain relative wealth by wisely allocating it, or else lose ground to others.
The risks of deflation is it encourages and rewards non-deployment and increases cost of capital, slowing investment and rewarding stagnation. 
It would probably make the most sense for a viable crypto currency to program in a mild and very predictable inflation that doesn't terminate, in the 0.5 to 2% range into perpetuity. Then you'd still have a guard against 'hyperinflation' ever happening, but you wouldn't have deterents for capital investment and rewards for 'hoarding' non allocation.

If someone takes donations in bitcoin, or sells a product in bitcoin...but then the moment they receive it they sell it and turn it into fiat, that puts downward pressure on price.

It sounds like you can't actually withdraw the crypto itself, and on their crypto side they're uninsured and not part of Finra or SIPC.
I've also seen people claiming their business model is to just earn the interest on your deposits for 3 days before clearing it, and that replaces the need for fees. 
That's not plausible. A billion dollars in deposits would only get them like $25,000 in interest like that.

No, it would not give a fixed multiple. That's my entire point.
If you measured it in LITRES it would give a fixed multiple.
If you measured it in percentage increase, it would not give a fixed multiple. 
Let's pretend we have 100 Litre pool and a 1 Litre Air balloon
Let's increase the balloon by 3 Litres, then decrease it by 2 Litres, then increase by 5, decrease by 3, increase by 7, decrease by 4, increase by 9, decrease by 5, increase by 11, decrease by 6, increase by 50, decrease by 25
The pool would do the exact same. We plug those into a Correlation calculator and the Correlation = 1
Now do Percentage. Balloon is 300%, -50%, 250%, -42%, 175%, -36%, 128%, -31%, 100%, -27%
Pool is now 3%, -1.9%, 4.9%, -2.8%, 6.7%, -3.6%, 8.4%, -4.3%, 9.9%, - 13.1%
We know these are not only correlated numbers, but are directly 1 to 1 causal. But now because I measured them using percentage, my R^2 is now 0.44 instead of 1.
Do you understand now? Using percentages makes Zero sense.

Only on the downside.
Bitcoin is not worth at least its inputs, but it's likely worth at maximum it's inputs.
If mining a coin costs $10,000 the price can still fall to $1,000 or $5. 
But if mining a coin costs $10,000 the price for a coin can't be $20,000 for any period of time. Either price must fall, or that cost must increase.

I'm not sure what conspiracy theorists are writing, but if their stuff is badly conducted, you can't point to another badly conducted thing and say they do it too. 
I'm not particularly interested in the topic, I don't think Tether does drive the bitcoin price, it's much too small in comparison. But to say they aren't correlated just isn't true. If I get a chance i'll look at it when I get home. I think just showing Weekly and using Dollar value will correlate. 
So yes, using Daily when the trends are bound to be bigger than just 1 day I think is a cherry pick. But also the specific metric, percentage price increase vs a percentage creation rate. 
That's not an intuitive time frame or set of metrics to measure. Why would the percentages or two different things correlate? Why within 1 day?

I didn't say a cryptocurrency couldn't survive if it was deflationary. I actually said what you just said, that it just means it's not a good currency and that it's some other different asset class. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:48:28
In this particular case I think if there is an impact it's too small to pick up. But as a general rule, you could use it to still establish a method to detect that type of relationship. 
Like this does in fact happen between different asset classes or different stocks, where the growth in one does fuel the growth in the other and so when it enters a downturn, you get a rapid decline. 
But you've got to use logical measures, like you can't set a radar gun to detect acceleration of a car then go give it a speeding ticket, you've got to make sure your tool is detecting the right variable and the right measure of the variable.

@_date: 2018-02-06 17:33:01
No no, I'm not just saying it's not as sensitive. 
I'm saying it literally makes no sense. 
We took a perfect 1 to 1 correlation and by changing the variable made it 0.44. 
What is the real correlation was only 0.44 to begin with? What if the real example was the balloon in the pool and water could evaporate and kids jumped in and out of the pool and sometimes a water truck helped fill the pool etc...
If you put that in, then measured it, the percentage would vastly over weight the early balloon stages and underweight it as it grew. Then the noise would be big enough to constantly flip signs. 
You'd get a near zero, or yes, potentially mildly negative correlation depending on the impact.
In this case of Tether, because it started the year in the single digit millions but ends in the billions, any regression or correlation will say 'Large percentage changes have small effects'  
The scales are so off, Tether literally starts the year at about a 1 to 10,000 scale of BTC. 
In my example to avoid so many decimals I only made it 1 to 100 and there was no noise, also it's only like a handful of data points, the more data points you add showing a randomly diminishing return relationship, the less it will correlate. 
Yes, of course it found a negative correlation...because as time went by the Tether percentage got smaller and smaller and Bitcoin's percentage change got more and more volatile. So you created a data set where a big change was always linked to a small gain, and a small change was linked to a large volatile change. 
It was designed for failure. 
They either intentionally or negligently used 3 variables in a way that specifically obscure the relationship. Their X value was always going to get smaller and smaller. 
They used Daily, if they had used weekly or monthly would there be a correlation? Yes
They used Percentage price of BTC, if they had used a dollar value would there be a correlation? Yes.
They used Percentage creation of Tether, if they had used a dollar value of creation, would there be a correlation? Yes.
Now at the end of the day, do I think Tether is responsible for Bitcoin's growth? No, that's idiotic, it's way way too small to make a big difference. 
But are they statistically correlated? Yes, they clearly, clearly are and you have to jump through hoops to find specific presentations of the variables to make it seem they are not. 
@_date: 2018-02-16 05:43:38
Right, but when a bank is caught doing that, they're fined serious amounts of money for doing it. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 05:12:44
So if it increases 100% in a few weeks, it's a bullish sign?
@_date: 2018-02-24 08:38:55
Or they could just take and keep the money. 
Their liability isn't legally enforceable in anyway. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:20:27
But no context makes that headline true. You wrote a false headline. 
It is absolutely cherry picked because it looks only at DAILY % gains vs a DAILY % creation rate as a percentage. That's probably the only way you could possibly measure to give no correlation. 
Weekly or Monthly % would correlate, Measuring dollar value gains on both would correlate, Measuring the creation rate and trading volume would correlate..
They intentionally picked the two measures that would not correlate when broken into a small enough time frame and stuck them together.
This is pure rhetoric, it's no better than p-hacking a study.

10 year fixed. 
Or any rate, find any fixed rate where the equivalent time period is more.

It's a scale problem and chaining problem. With dozens or hundreds of chain routes, you're fine. But to have chain routes 6 deep for instance, you'd need 1,000,000 nodes, then 10,000,000 etc.. 
So you actually have a few centralized ones and you don't have a decentralized network anymore. Everyone has to stay within 1 or 2 nodes from major centers. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:54:00
If you hold the new trade, it's not relevant. 
You bought at 6500, sold at 6800. That's your gain for 2018 assuming you don't sell anything else. 
Tax wise you didn't 'lose' anything. Not owning something that goes up isn't a loss. 
Now the investing BTC into other alts is where it gets super tricky, I don't think the government itself knows what the rules are for that because some alts are only valued in the BTC or ETH price, never actually valued in USD. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:53:28
Unfortunately, I don't think you'll find that's true. 
You're offering USD payments, whether you 'hold' it or not.

@_date: 2018-02-06 15:40:41
But they're not a fixed multiple of the other number. 
This guy did an analysis using a Percentage gain, so they aren't a fixed multiple.
In the Pool/Balloon example, they aren't a fixed multiple.
Know what they would be? When DONT USE PERCENTAGE GAINS 
If you use percentage gains on the balloon random walk, you'll get a correlation of about 0.3333 
If you use actual litre increases, your correlation will be 1
The author of this analysis should have used the DOLLAR VALUE INCREASES not the percentages. 
It's completely useless for that reason.

I never understand this crap, who is at this point bullish, and yet still has a bunch of money on the sidelines ready to buy?
Every dip its 'Oh it's a buying chance!' with what? If you a super bullish and have extra money sitting around, why didn't you buy with it 6 months ago? 
Every time its this crap and the people obviously don't have another $10 to their name to put in, let alone some hidden stash of money to double their position. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:37:43
It's a weird way to think of it, but its technically true, right? 
Obviously the account can't stay open in the name of a deceased person. 
I wouldn't write 'this breaches the terms of service' but the actual point of the message which is "we're going to close this account and it still owes $3,200" is still correct. 
It's obviously a form letter that someone didn't think through, but it's not like legally incorrect, it's just a very poor and insensitive phrasing. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:34:39
Yeah, they shouldn't send a weirdly worded form letter. 
But what else? How does this have literally anything to do with Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2018-07-11 18:39:22
Does it? 
The account wasn't frozen for no reason, and the person owed money so no balance was frozen. How does this shed light?
@_date: 2018-02-10 10:00:55
That's not their motivation though, this is. No one has any idea how to monitor it for Money Laundering risk, so eventually any bank accepting it is going to get a big fine.

That'd be 2.1 Quadrillion, total money supply globally is only $30 Trillion to $90 Trillion depending if you use broad or Narrow definitions. 
It'd be closer to a $1 million coin than $100 Million
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:35:43
Yeah, it doesn't establish any sort of causation.
But to say Tether creation and Bitcoin price are not correlated is completely false. 
They just picked the weirdest possible way to measure, using daily amounts and using percentage for Tether market cap.
It's like they designed it specifically to find no correlation...which is exactly what I think the goal was. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:54:03
Well, yes they're saying it's false. The headline here is "No Correlation" that's categorically not true. 
There's an incredibly strong correlation.
And no, that's not a normal statistical test. That's the most nonsense cherry picked thing you could imagine. Daily gains vs daily creation? 
The analysis doesn't do anything at all to address manipulation over time because it completely and intentionally removed the 'over time' part by using daily percentages.
The analysis is trying to come to the answer it wanted to ahead of time and it manipulated the variables measured until it did. 
@_date: 2018-07-11 21:29:49
I think even then that's not the case, you'll often have accounts created like 'The Estate of...' but you're not supposed to be letting other people just control accounts like that. 
If its a bank account with a spouse it's fine because its a joint account, but if it's just an account individually owned, without a beneficiary or Payable-on-death provision then its also frozen until the legal process determines where to transfer it. 
There's no like 'oh you can use the account of the dead person for 2-3 weeks' clause. Of course the account will be distributed as the will dictates, but that's not just done by the executor on their own, you file documents and stuff to execute the will. 
You can't just keep using the accounts
@_date: 2019-09-24 16:17:02

Yeah, she died with a balance owing so they're closing the account and the money is still owed. That how everything works. 
And the last few lines of this are ridiculous 
" A PayPal spokesperson declared that this was some kind of internal mistake. Paypal has been attacked by the emergence of cryptocurrencies as alternative payment forms, but they have been repeatedly shunned by their dirigents by saying that they are experiments that have no real value to this date. "
dirigents has no English meaning that fits here, are they slipping in some Catalonian or Czech?
This reads like someone ending the article with "But Paypal's decadent ways will soon draw to a close as the proletariat shall rise and scatter their obsolete system across the blood soaked wheat fields!"

I could transfer my money onto a Crypto exchange (who takes a cut of it) then make a trade for the Crypto (and have them take a cut) then transfer it to my wallet (and have them take a cut of the transfer) and then worry about my own security and the legitimacy of the exhcnage (which have gone bankrupt and been 'hacked' resulting in losses in the tens of billions in the past few years) and rely on the wallet and security (which have had exploits, flaws and deficiencies)  then to sell it I have to reverse the whole process, maybe spending days with transfers in pending statuses and markets not filling orders (like a few months ago) and then hope the exchanges maintain liquidity and can still transfer fiat back to my accounts (which have been demarketed by many banks)
Or I can buy shares of an ETF and pay a 0.2&amp; fee usually associated with an ETF and know my funds are covered by tons of insurance and know it's very liquid on global central marketplaces running for over 100 years instead of one a 27 year old started last November. 
People in Crypto have a most warped sense of trust...someone will tell you The Federal Reserve and stock markets are a scam ponzi scheme, but then explain in the next breath why Bitfinex and Tether are 100&amp; secure.

I'd be surprised if it was intentional. In almost all cases those things are very automated auto-detection software and then investigated by low-level staff. 
If they want to toss out large clients, I'd think the business would push back, it's like that in banks too, but for smaller clients no one cares and they wouldn't risk the fines and regulation problems to keep clients with $5k and stuff. Maybe Million dollar clients you jump through a few more hoops.
But almost all the complaints we end up seeing on here are usually pretty low amounts in the scheme of things. If they got caught rigging it they basically lose the entire business, it'd be hard to avoid getting caught for it too, the audits for that type of thing are done multiple times a year by different organizations in the US.
