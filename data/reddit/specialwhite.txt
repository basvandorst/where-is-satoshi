Valid but barely visible. So you really mean not valid.

I'm sure there isn't 1 person on this planet who still didn't see this was a scam. Impossible. If you're that stupid you probably wouldn't know how to turn a computer on in the first place.

Not one person has ever shown me any evidence that Cyprus was the reason Bitcoin went up. And you also might be confused with the band.

Big institutional money getting in? Just like it would early 2014?
@_date: 2015-01-31 14:18:41
I read exactly the same thing in the first month of 2014. Really EXACTLY the same.

Nothing will happen feb 11. Stop being so gullible.

They will never learn here. Deadline after deadline when "it" will happen. Nothing ever happens but they just ignore it and try to find the next deadline. 
@_date: 2015-01-31 18:18:21
That is a possibility yes.

The victims are greedy idiots who ignored the non stop warnings be ause they thought they knew better and would get rich quick.

I think he compared 2 charts with a line going down. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 13:42:36
You're insane. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 13:41:54
Don't forget the fact that if one small city would start paying in Bitcoin completely it would pretty much kill the blockchain. 
And these people think whole countries will switch to Bitcoin. It's insane.

Can't you see it was posted already?

How exactly?
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:07:19
You are 16, right? 
@_date: 2015-02-01 13:58:07
Sure. You have absolutely no idea what i'm talking about. Everyone believes you. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 15:13:59
Yes, it's absolutely ridiculous. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:58:53
Many here believe this. For them it's this simple: The Euro goes down so there is only one option possible and that is that everyone will move to Bitcoin. That's all. That is how far their logic goes. It seems perfectly reasonable to them. And everyone that doesn't agree 100% will be downvoted. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 14:04:20
Maybe you should figure out what the downvoting button is for. Hint: it's not for trying to censor people you don't agree with. That is just beyond sad. Don't you think?
@_date: 2015-02-01 13:44:57
Pasta holders are also unaffected.

Poe's law applies here. 
@_date: 2015-02-01 13:33:42
I think you know exactly what he means. You just don't like these facts when we're going down.
