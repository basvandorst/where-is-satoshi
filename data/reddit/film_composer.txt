Same. I used to be sort of in the loop about Bitcoin a few years ago, now I'm reading this title and it's as foreign to me as ["Galaxy Nexus: Android Ice Cream Sandwich Guinea Pig"](

Isn't it a big concern that your wallet is publicly viewable? Not for security since you need the key to move money out of it, but for privacy. I wouldn't be all that happy with someone being able to see how much I have... I guess you could set up a "receiving" wallet and a "storage" wallet and move funds to the storage one after receiving them, but that seems convoluted and adding one more layer of "don't fuck this up or you're screwed forever."
What do people generally do about this? Do others have just one wallet and not care that its balance is publicly viewable?

The scarcity guarantees that if Bitcoin does make it big and is successful, by necessity the price will have to increase dramatically. The bigger "if" isn't whether or not a bitcoin could equal thousands of USD one day, it's whether Bitcoin can become successful enough to be a mainstay success.

I'm seriously considering doing this. Is there any restriction against making multiple orders? 10 separate orders, each $500 purchases, at a cost of $3,500. Sell them on eBay for $5,000 (or something slightly less to attract buyers), ???, profit.
Normally the "flipping" method on retail doesn't make any sense, because if *you* can get the item at a discount, why couldn't whoever you're selling it to get the same deal? But in this case, most people don't have access to these deals because they don't have Bitcoin (or not enough to buy $500 worth of stuff).

I hate to say it, but Google does a terrible job at making things user-friendly. Their search engine is as usable as it can possibly be, but YouTube is a complete nightmare (as an uploader, not someone who just watches videos). Google Drive is functional but very poorly structured from a usability point of view. Google+ never caught on in part because it isn't easy to just dive in and know what you're doing. Of course, Google is quite successful and none of this has affected their success, but outside of their search engine, "user-friendly" is not their strong suit. Bear in mind that none of us have any issues with using Google's services because we're all tech savvy. "User-friendly" means that Grandma can pick it up and start using it right away, which I seriously doubt Google is capable of doing.

I have no idea why that app comes with the phone. I've done iPhone tech support for a year and a half, taken thousands and thousands of calls, and I've literally never had a single person ask a single question about the app. It could be because the type of person who pays attention to stocks doesn't normally need tech support (most people who call in are as tech-novice as they come), but it remains the only app/feature/setting on the iPhone that I've never once had to answer a question about.

I agree with you on this, but also saying "1BTC = $1M USD" is a shorthand way of saying that the purchasing power of a single bitcoin would be the equivalent of $1,000,000 in today's standards. If bitcoin does take off and its value does skyrocket, I'm not going to trade to USD to buy a new car, but a new car can be afforded with a single bitcoin because its purchasing power raised to a very high value.

In regards to security concerns, wouldn't it be (relatively) easy to program a virus that detects whenever your computer is showing a QR code and replaces it with another one? Let's say I'm buying something online with bitcoin, and the website generates the address to which to send the payment. The virus replaces the displayed QR code/address with one that sends the funds to the wrong address, one that the virus-maker has control over. You wouldn't know this until after the transaction is already complete, because addresses are just random anyway and one looks just like any other.
As far as viruses ago, unless you're actively scanning for it, this one could be nearly impossible to detect until it's too late (in the sense that it doesn't need to violate your key/wallet at all, only where you're sending your payment, so it can be completely dormant until it attacks), and it seems like it would be completely feasible to program something like this without much effort. The bigger issue is getting it onto users' computers, but because of its nature it could wait for months before attacking, so it might not be at all obvious where it's coming from.
Other viruses can be easy to avoid falling victim to by not keeping your keys on your computer and keeping your wallet in cold storage, but this one could trick a lot of people if it was pulled off. Any ideas?

Nice idea, but I'd leave out the useless questions ("Are you male or female?" "Are you self aware?").
EDIT: And if you're trying to reach a broad audience, leave out the inside jokes and be more professional. A new person reading "Where is the moon?" "You can learn about the moon's location here. Were you referring to some other kind of moon? Haha" is going to be confused and put off.

It's really interesting reading the [Wikipedia page]( for FidoNet, BBS, and other early-Internet technology. History is written by the victors, for sure, but even more than that, history typically only even remembers the victors and the losers disappear from the collective conscience altogether. Bitcoin could be the "next Internet," in terms of importance and social influence, but it could also very well be a ten-year precursor to the actual "next Internet," like FidoNet was in some roundabout way.
