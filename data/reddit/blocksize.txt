“Bitcoin gets around [admissions control] with the proof-of-work stuff. I thought, this is cool. Maybe some people will use it for anti-spam, but it can’t be secure,” he said.
Later on in 2009, Maxwell noticed bitcoin was still around. He then read over the source code."

I think I might take some time to explain myself when getting paid a part of 21 million to work on an open source project. 
I do not understand why Greg is the face of the 1MB movement. Much respect for Greg, has nothing to do with his previous work. All the devs have certainly been incorrect at one time or another. 
I see Greg post on almost every single block size post so he is inserting himself as the authority on the subject. Every dev has posts pointed at them now and again. Comes with the territory. Nothing personal.

Typical showing of circumlocution courtesy of Gregory. I did appreciate this portion of your long-winded response. 


Let us all be humble, there are several potential solutions to the problem of Bitcoin scalability. As you have admitted, what once seemed impossible became reality! Let us look back at this community squabble in a couple of years and laugh seeing how far we have come.
Egos complicate things. I would guess this is part of the reason Satoshi chose to be anonymous. To free himself from identity politics. 
You should not expect participants to simply trust your judgement. Do you believe you are the smartest dev? Smarter than Satoshi? There is always a smarter dev. Various solutions from a variety of intelligent devs. 
Humility through anonymity and respect for the ideas of others.

Self proclaimed expert on decentralized consensus proven wrong. Continues on to be self proclaimed expert on scalability. 
To be continued. 
Always good to admit when one is wrong and move on though. I have much respect towards Gregory for that aspect.

What a cop out. He said decentralized consensus was **impossible** and it is evidently not. With that in mind, you would think Greg would be more open minded towards a technology that according to him can not exist! 
No man is free from error, I only suggest that controversial devs approach upcoming changes with a sense of humility. 
Personally, I would prefer to defer decision making to the creator of the impossible, Satoshi, whenever possible.

sidechain fork is not contentious because Blockstream said so and block size fork is contentious because Blockstream said so

If Paypal is better for sending tiny values why are micro transactions impossible using Paypal? It is cheaper to transfer value using **cryptocurrency** rather than Paypal. 
The centralized service is not in a vacuum, there are overhead costs associated with running a centralized payment processor when compared to Bitcoin. Mainly employees and legal compliance. 
Do you use Paypal? There are a lot of fees associated with the service. I have personally replaced Paypal with Bitcoin in my personal life to conduct commerce in several instances where it made sense to do so. 
Near frictionless transactions are one of the benefits of cryptocurrency. If Bitcoin cannot provide this form of utility other cryptocurrencies will.
