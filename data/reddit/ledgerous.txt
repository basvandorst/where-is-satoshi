Read the whole item description. Classic. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:24:59
Yeah... Not so much. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:07:50
I bought at 12k this morning. Time to HODL on!
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:30:09
I'm new. Put some in at 12, then 14, then 17. I'm a few K behind ATM... But I was a few K ahead a few days ago...  So I'm ok with it... I expected it really.
I am actually enjoying being "in the game" and experiencing it all first hand.

I lived in the middle east for 7 years, they charge interest on loans but give it a different name... It's still calculated as a percentage of the principal though. :/
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:21:13
This is me right now. I, like op, purchased at 12k and can't stop looking at charts! 
@_date: 2018-05-07 08:04:56
I didn't know that, fark. Now I gotta kill my account there. Fuck Ver.

This guy... ��
@_date: 2019-10-26 07:18:58
Just as bloody accurate as any other measure.
@_date: 2019-02-07 01:56:45
Agreed. And BBS systems died, but spawned newer, better tech (IRC, fserves, etc). It's very possible the same is true of BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-28 09:19:00
Hodlers dont care. ��
@_date: 2019-06-05 23:18:51
All for only 2 BTC!
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:07:23
Over 10k on Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:10:07
...and on Gatecoin.
@_date: 2019-06-02 03:55:03
I was also wondering this... ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:11:01
...and OKCoin.
@_date: 2019-06-02 03:53:27
I just saw this as well. I'm very surprised at this move! ��
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:11:41
...and Anxpro.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:10:25
But did it get to the moon?
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:16:30
No pic required now. ;)
@_date: 2018-11-11 03:40:33
Have the bots taken over the world, or is it just me? ��
@_date: 2018-11-24 22:55:40
This made me lol, have an up vote. :)
@_date: 2019-01-17 09:57:01
Right there with you bro... Still waiting on my ET tokens to be confirmed. ��
@_date: 2019-01-30 06:23:18
You'll easily be able to do this on localbitcoins. ;)
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:59:06
What HODLers? All I see on the charts are panic sellers. :/
@_date: 2018-02-17 04:13:30
Former goat owner here. I agree 100%. Goats are cunts.
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:14:28
This is an excellent feature. Well done Binance team!
@_date: 2018-04-29 03:43:09
This guy is spot on. Yes, buy your $2k in btc and transfer it to a paper wallet, then stick it in a safe or something. You can also transfer additional btc to the paper wallet any time you want to add to it... Kinda like a little btc vault. ;)
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:34:29
Hodl mode, engaged.
@_date: 2018-04-30 08:46:50
What's wrong with paper? I would suggest it is at least, or more secure than a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:13:45
Right there with ya.
@_date: 2018-04-10 00:52:13
They are on AliExpress for about $1 each. Quiet the bargain.
@_date: 2018-04-25 03:16:53
I do exactly the same. Maybe I'm paranoid, but I just don't trust hardware wallets. :/
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:36:30
Upvoted to spread the message. At least you're trying! Fight the FUD!
@_date: 2018-12-20 10:29:30
Down voted for commenting on price movement in a price thread. Interesting sub this. 
@_date: 2019-05-21 12:00:17
If you're gonna HODL just use a paper wallet. If you're gonna be active, go for a nano. ;)
@_date: 2018-12-20 08:47:42
...and down again. Feels about right.
