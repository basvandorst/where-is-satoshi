Let’s be honest. You guys act as if your job provides you with an immense amount of income. As if 50,000$ or 100,000$ isn’t a lot of money. 
Be honest, how long does it take you to save 10,000$ from your jobs? while still taking care of your family? 
People aren’t stupid. And money is not so easy to come by. Be realistic and respect money. I’d bet bitcoin doesn’t ever achieve or sustain over 100,000 probably ever. If it does we would need serious institutional investing. And they my friends they are not dipshits. Respect money. I make 60$ an hour as a union carpenter. That’s it. 
You guys talk big numbers. I’d bet your accounts aren’t so big. All I’m gonna say.

And who do you think it is... The US government? no wonder we’re sanctioning countries who don’t follow suit with our crypto regulations.

Hell yeah, and bros no disrespect. I love this market and I see the volatility, sling shots. High risk, high reward. I’ve been in for over 2 years. Before the parabolic rise. 
I do invest in bitcoin. I love it. But I’m not so sure if it’s manipulation or if they can actually sustain huge huge numbers. We all act as if there’s no ceiling. When things are getting multi billion dollar market caps I wouldn’t expect the same 1000% returns. Let things mature :) 
My whole point was even with my income. I’m still broke. So we gotta respect money and not just pull numbers out of our asses. We have a chance to make it. If Bakkt, gold and other institutional movements solidify the market we stand a chance. I’m with you men. Let’s roll the dice! 
Cheers mates.
