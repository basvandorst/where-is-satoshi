DNS server and ATM machine are also commonly spoken.

BRZ should have been AWD to differentiate.

I am one of them! But I have to limit my max number of users to keep my ISP's 1TB limit under control.

I'm quite far removed from car culture these days - I literally drive a beige minivan and used to drive a 280zx (who am I? ha). I'm just thinking of product differentiation. If the Subaru is more up-trim inside that makes sense.

I have to stick to 4-doors, so depending on budget Civic SI -&gt; WRX -&gt; Golf R.  
  
Dream car is a Caterham since I'm short.

If I run a node on my Plex server and cap it to the 8 users because of bandwidth caps am I still helping?

I mined ~0.55BTC on an AMD 5850. Stopped when the USD value of waht I mined daily dropped below the energy costs. Lost roughly half of that to Mt. Gox. Still holding on to my 0.25BTC.

I see K-12 as providing a great baseline of general education that is good for everyone. When you enter into discussions of higher education the learning tends to be more focused and may not have the net benefit to society. I don't think a plumber with a master's in mechanical engineering is intrinsically better than someone with 5 more years experience.

Correlation isn't causality though - can you verify the causation of high GDP per capita to be a primary result of subsidized university? Generally those countries tend to have a lower corporate tax rate, could that not also be considered a factor? Or subsidized healthcare leading to returns in business risk.

I agree on your ends, I just don't agree with the means :) By decentralizing I don't necessarily mean privatizing, I just want more competition. Think of how much people can learn for free by having access to Wikiepdia, Coursera, or Codecademy, then extrapolate that to anything. I'm not the best equipped to visualize it, I just like the iconoclasm of "Web 2.0" approaches.

I'd rather see a larger decentralization of the power to educate so that colleges have to compete on value with sources like Coursera. Don't hide the cost, make it functionally cheaper.

This may only work because I am in the tech industry, but I'll use programming as an example. CS students can go to school and learn how to program, but the best coders I've ever met were doing it in middle school, or at least high school, and largely self-taught.  
  
By subsidizing college/university it doesn't make it cheaper to provide (quite the opposite I believe) but removes the cost from the student. While a noble venture, I'd rather policy approach the cost of educating, or a greater societal move away from demanding useless degrees, than just distributing the burden of the investment.

I'm differentiating university from public school (K-12), sorry if I didn't make that distinction.

I'd run a bitcoin node if Comcast didn't ~strongly~ discourage tx+rx total use above 300GB/mo.

I thought Japan ruled bitcoin is not something that can be owned. If that's the case, why is there any embezzling charge being placed?
