Um, charge back? I'm sure you can get that money back, otherwise that's theft, and they can get fucked up for that

Erowid is legit doing live saving work, I can not thank them enough for their service
@_date: 2018-01-31 11:30:37
Threaten to sue. They took your money and didn't provide any product or service. That's legit theft

Blockchain.info doesn't like bech32
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:24:41
Didn't know he paid with crypto. Guess he's fucked then
@_date: 2018-01-04 21:42:52
Iirc electrum warns you that segwit addresses are a work in progress and aren't accepted everywhere. Electrum isn't the problem, it's everyone else for not accepting bech32
@_date: 2018-01-12 20:30:37
@_date: 2018-01-13 19:43:28
As long as your sending from a segwit address, it's a segwit transaction

Bought my first coins last September at like 350ish I wanna say. Been buying coins since then for drugs, but now I'm hodling all the way to the moon. Any spare money I got is being put into btc
@_date: 2017-12-14 00:33:31
Can confirm, only reason I know metric is because of drugs

Oh damn, any chance these will be up for sale?
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:50:02
I totally feel with the buying drugs with BTC, I spent a couple grand a week on BTC to re-up when I was pushing weight. Now I'm kinda wishing I just saved that cause it's a few bitcoins
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:32:14
your a bubble

@_date: 2017-12-15 00:39:55
Someone keeps throwing up massive sell walls at 17,250 on gdax. Like over 1k BTC, so im tending to believe you that someone is fucking with the price
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:11:58
Yes, donate to them. MAPS is doing some great work with psychedelics and MDMA. I have some PTSD after being robbed at gunpoint and love MDMA, so MAPS is doing some shit that's close to me. I've thrown some coin their way to fund the 2 kilos of MDMA they need
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:06:42
Calling hits on people really fucked him over. Not that running silk road didn't, but calling those hits really wasn't smart on his part
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:26:24
No, just know what your doing. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:25:41
MAPS. they are doing some groundbreaking work with PTSD treatment using MDMA assisted psychotherapy. they need another 12.5 million or so to finish funding their phase 3 clinical trails.
they also accept btc directly, so thats nice.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:38:21

Internet drug dealing
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:52:33
Gdax pays mining fees iircso if you do that it shouldn't cost anything to move
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:13:15
Nah, just all the internet drug dealers. Bill really shouldn't affect most legitimate people who aren't trying to launder money or buy drugs online
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:46:15
Convert to monero then move to Belize. Have fun
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:48:18
Where the fuck do.you live that 600k is only an apartment?

Do people magically get viruses from torrenting? No, people get tricked into downloading fake shit 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:48:31
yeah, GDAX is coinbase, its a legit company.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:06:26
And now it's 15.8k. fuck Bitcoin is great
@_date: 2017-12-14 10:53:19
Yes, thank you. Maps will make sure it's put to good use
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:47:21
Change to monero then cash out from there
@_date: 2017-12-12 11:19:00
Depends, you willing to break him out?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:12:27
well if you change a lot of crypto into fiat even if its legal and you cant explain it your gonna have some issues regardless of the bill, but i see your point
@_date: 2018-08-16 20:58:13
I have 2k withdrawal a day, and I generally pay less than 1% purchase fees with free withdrawals in the next block on cashapp. Don't know what your talking about

Other people can't see the contents of your wallet with monero, we need a greater push for privacy coins. And getting an anonymous drop isn't hard, how you think drug dealers do it?
@_date: 2017-12-16 14:02:17
This makes me so happy to hear. Glad you got that money, you need and deserve it. Your doing some incredible work. I just wrote a research paper about PTSD treatment through history and gave you guys a shout out.
Continue doing what your doing MAPS, your all an amazing group of people and I'd love to have a chance to work with you one day
@_date: 2019-03-04 14:20:27
Yep, this is it
@_date: 2018-06-27 18:54:44
I'd seriously delete that. Your gonna get doxxed and that's not something you wanna fuck around with

If your not spending your coins rn then upgrading to segwit can be postponed. Once your done hodling change to a segwit address though. Should be the standard by the end of the year

Your not sending millisats from an onchain BTC wallet. You fund a lighting channel with a 1 sat+ transaction and then you can send sub sat amounts on there since your on lightning.
