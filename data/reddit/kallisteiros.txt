Just so you know, you can have a vanity address using generators: [
Andreas Antonopoulos got [
You can have 1R0BERT too.

Yes, it's a completely useless formula. Issue 1 billion coins and sell one for $1 on exchange. Voila, you instantly got $1B market cap.

What price was it?
Just goes to show that external data is not very reliable for oracle purposes, even if some of them would be able to have caught it.
Especially if lots of money is at stake.

Money. The most valuable gift one could give. (Currency being the next on the list.)

Me too. There was a correlation between economic crisis of '08 and increase in suicide and crime rates. The next crisis promises to greatly surpass the previous one. Pretty grim picture.

Not getting it. You can certainly easily distinguish between Ethereum addresses (that are for ERC20 too) and Bitcoin addresses. They have different lengths and formats.

Do you happen to know an example of anybody successfully cornering a medium to big size market?
Whenever you start doing that, people notice and you shoot yourself in the foot. The price soars, you have to spend more and more to buy the same amount, then people start dumping on you (making your last trades worth less), and you still haven't gotten the whole thing. You can get a lot with lots of money (especially using OTC markets), but not the whole supply.
When you have enough money to buy or sell any sizable amount of Bitcoin on exchanges, you'll understand.

Do you mean the contract address?
Not sure how you can display "main chain". The hash of the latest block for whatever consensus the exchange uses? That would be handy, I agree.
But it wouldn't solve the problem of general stupidity. People that lost money to BCC/BCH confusion would have been just as inattentive if the exchanges had this information.

0-conf. The physical presence would make double spend attempts too risky.

So where do you think they spend them? They have to be spent to get into circulation.
Strengthening the USD would be to burn/stash excess money supply, not to increase it.

They can't. Google Hunt Brothers &amp; Silver Market, when they tried to do the same with silver.
