If they have access to Satoshi's coins, they can generate a lot of bad PR for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:39:52
I see that I misread their statement. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:49:53
If you owned bitcoin on July 31st 2017, you can claim BTCash.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:03:02
That sounds very cumbersome. Do you believe that IRS has or will have tools to audit bitcoin transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:48:49
Can you explain  please?
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:30:27
I love Electrum.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:47:11
You would have 1 BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:07:48
Perhaps, we will now find out who they really are...
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:47:43
Why would you hold forever, if you can sell, wait till the price drops, then buy more?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:53:20
If you still have the Electrum wallet (or the seed), then you should export the private keys and import them into a bitcash wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:41:46
No, I think this is a real problem. And one of the reasons why BCash made me question my belief in BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:32:38
Everyone who had BTC before July31st has Bcash.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:36:15
See, this is exactly why bcash has some legitimacy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:22:40
Is no legal action possible?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:49:28
Young people who hate govt buy weed, not bitcoin.

"new comers thinking they are related"
They are related. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:57:21
Just so you know, the day I discovered Electrum was the day I believed that BTC can go mainstream.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:02:51
"BTC holders will receive [...] also a proportional number of Bitcoin founder Satoshi Nakamoto`s coins as a reward for their commitment to progress."
If true, it may be game over for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:59:29
Cause bitcoin.com comes before bitcoin.org?
Sorry, but I simply can't believe that Bitcoin Core was dumb enough to not register bitcoin.com...
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:30:20
I think Coinbase is the best exchange bar none and don't understand why them supporting BCH is such a big deal. If they added, say, dogecoin instead, would you still be upset?
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:54:26
Can plebs node today?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:26:53
OK, I didn't know that, but now I wonder how many more traitors they have on that team.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:35:01
LOL, that's nothing. This was my transaction earlier today:
I think it's a real problem that BTC has become expensive (and slow).
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:14:04
That's a good point! 
I like Coinbase a lot, so perhaps, I am biased. However, I don't see why people here hate them just because they started to support BCH. What was the reaction like when they added support for ETH and/or Litecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:10:49
Well, they didn't have to name it "Bitcoin" then. Or, if they felt so strongly about the name, they should've bought bitcoin.com for whatever it was worth back then. One of the first rules of starting an internet business is to get a .com domain.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:25:44
Not sure I understand. If they had announced the addition yesterday, what would've been different?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:20:47
Thanks, but my question still stands. How did the Bitcoin (Core) community allow this?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:38:35
Electrum works for me well.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:31:57
I didn't think of selling BTC, but today's event made me actually ask whether I should invest long-term into BTC or BCH. If the founder of bitcoin.com keeps creating "Better Bitcoin" forks every X days, this could end up badly for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:25:08
Actually, that's a good counter-argument. But as we know, it's all about mass perception. I am genuinely curious how Bitcoin vs Bcash will play out now that the latter is in the mainstream. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:18:05
In other words, plebs don't (want to) node.
@_date: 2017-12-20 07:50:47
Always. A fork is basically a copy of the original chain up to that point.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:00:49
Well, of course you have no bitcoin in it. 
Also, do not use Electron cash =&gt; 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:17:59
I agree that nothing will should happen to your bitcoins. As for Bitcoin Cash, all best are off imo.
