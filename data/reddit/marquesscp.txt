(don't know how it exactly answers your question. gonna rewatch the vid again because well, it's andreas)
Edit: so 100mb block is good for 300M people to make 5tx/month/person
That's really not enough
@_date: 2018-01-09 01:20:30
imo yes.
By far the most attack resistance and secure crypto out there. BTC's priority is security this is obvious.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:07:54
I'm sure most users would rather wait 1min (which is nothing) to save like 80% on fees.
They are just incredibly dumb or corrupt and getting their money elsewhere
@_date: 2018-01-08 21:46:45


This is so wrong. People really think its just change a number and boom problem solved.. Wow how didn't the devs think of that before

and here I am thinking it's all about being your own bank and controlling your own funds..
@_date: 2018-01-08 22:16:06
It will not. You pay the fee of a tx you would have done either way, and you move the remainder to a segwit address so you can save next time. Essentially you moved your coins to a segwit address for free.
You don't have to make a tx just to transfer to segwit. You can piggyback on your next tx.


suuuuure. So now Segwit does some savings but it's not enough. Also you just pulled that info where?? 
On Dec 18 Subhan Nadeem has pointed out that:
[If every transaction in the Bitcoin network was a SegWit transaction today, blocks would contain up to 8,000 transactions, and the 138,000 unconfirmed transaction backlog would disappear instantly. Transaction fees would be almost non-existent once again](

Will never not upvote this
@_date: 2018-01-21 14:45:04
tx space =/= # of txs 
So you can have more transactions and still be using less space.

@_date: 2018-01-27 15:21:15


well there's your answer
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:39:27


100MB blocks won't be enough for a very near future (assuming BCH actually got adopted more). And then if you want really low fees (with adoption) you need blocks way bigger than 100mb. Like 1GB won't be enough for everyone to use. And now you are downloading 1GB every 10mins. And you need to store it.
Disk space isn't evolving that fast, neither is bandwith adoption
So it's temporary. Or the very least a very bad scaling solution

They would be amazing if that didn't bring the whole possibility that they can freeze your own money. It's once they stop protecting you and start protecting them that you realise the fuck up.
For example banks banning people from buying crypto. Fuck that, it's MY money. What should they care if I go buy Magical Extra-terrestial carrots or btc. I should be able to do what I want with my money (as long as it is within the law of course). And this isn't true. So that's what's wrong with banks on a very superficial level. The worst is that it doesn't stop here.
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:40:12
I'll take another look tomorrow or so to see if it does all I need (I don't need much). I usually don't buy apps (only ever bought one and that was after trying it and really liking it). 
You should consider adding a (could be very limited) free version so people can just try it. I know I find it hard to buy it just like that
but amazing job
@_date: 2018-01-27 17:02:22
my bank (and this is not something that happened to me or in my country) is blocking people's transfers to exchange accounts. This is not something from the government because atm they've said they are not even going to tax btc earnings. 
It's the bank's own idea (spoiler alert they are partners in ripple). It's not always the gov telling them what to do. In most cases it's not unless you are a high profile guy

@_date: 2018-01-09 12:56:30
That part is not an opinion though. The problem is much more complex than what most people think and there are tons of reasons why Core aren't implementing a block size increase.
The top post is correct. Apparently the majority of people don't want a block size increase, otherwise they'd be using Segwit, or don't care about the fees atm or are simply too dumb to realise aswell.
Segwit is a good solution like it is for example solar energy. people just need to start using it
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:35:20
it is tho. It's showing people who are transacting from Segwit adresses
@_date: 2018-01-21 22:07:59


This is not necessarily true and it was the point of my original comment. 
But whatever this is kinda pointless
@_date: 2018-01-15 02:41:17
if the only purpose of the txs is to raise fees then that's spam.
I have no doubt that many of those tx are something like A sends to B that sends to C that sends do D (...) that send to X that sends to A
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:27:02
but then you are using banks.. so yea..
But seriously that's 1 good example out of thousands. Try and send a transfer to another bank especially in another country and see how much that costs you. It's good that you have a proper bank but most people don't have that option

@_date: 2018-01-21 14:53:04
his question makes sense though. Even if it's not USD having the total amount for the fee (in btc) is also super useful.
For most newcomers 35sat/byte tells them nothing. If you say they paid 1$ or whatever is the equivalent in btc it is much easier for them to understand
@_date: 2018-01-10 12:05:55
looking at that guys post history..
This is why we can't have nice things
@_date: 2018-01-30 01:46:17
from what I've read in comments a while ago, while SegWit isn't truly required for LN it makes implementation harder (not sure about this) and alot more insecure (pretty sure about this). So yea that's why we are getting LN a few months after segwit was adopted
@_date: 2018-01-11 02:43:58
for that you do an on chain transaction because
- most big transactions don't need to be instant. like if you have to pay your rent or buy a car whatever. so you can set it as low prio tx with low fees
- because of the above the fees won't be too large and compared to the value of the tx they will be quite small. if you transfer 1000€ do you really mind if the fee is like 2€?? That's 0.2% which is very reasonable
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:13:58
before investing read all you can about the technology. If that doesn't make you want to adopt (because adopt sounds better than invest) then this is probably not for you.

@_date: 2018-01-29 02:34:44
There has been lots of noobs leaving btc or crypto in general. Those people tended to not use or care about segwit at all. Them leaving means that if the number of Segwit user remains the same the % will increase.
And I think it's quite likely that the majority of segwit users are people who understand the technology better and as such won't leave so easily

Transfer to GDAX (its inside their system so no fees and instant), and then from GDAX to your address
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:59:47


Then why are they still holding any fiat or spending it on anything other than BTC?
This argument doesn't stick. Sure your pizza would be worth millions of dollars right now but so would any 10$ you had at the time. The mistake wasn't using those BTC. It was not buying them back or more even
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:17:45
LTC will have the same problem. People don't understand that many of BTC's problem come from the fact that it is the biggest coin so it will have the biggest burden in terms of scale.
"But but, ltc fees are so small!!" yea of course they are. because they have around the 1/10 the number of tx in a system that is much less secure
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:09:13
read that whole comment chain
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:41:06
yes? Why would that suck?? You pop like 0.05 btc into a channel and now you have amount to spend. In fact if you also receive from that address you can in theory keep that channel opened and use it forever. You just can't have a balance less than 0 or bigger than 0.05 but that can last a long time.
People that complain about "uh muh opening a channel stinks" have no fucking clue about how btc, blockchain etc works. It's a genius solution but of course it has some limitations. people expect btc to make millions of transactions a second and instantly.. well now you are looking at VISA
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:45:04
right now what we can do is push segwit adoption. And "boycott" companies that refuse to implement them (looking at you coinbase).
With segwit things would be alot smoother than they are (altough far from perfect ofc). it would let devs work in peace.
I also share your concerns but I get their point. There's lots of money involved and if there's a mistake btc can be done for good.
@_date: 2017-12-25 02:31:25
I read somewhere that if you make another transaction **from the same address** with a higher fee, once that one gets put in a block they have to include the other one aswell to prevent double spend..
But I have not confirmed this so do your research
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:18:04
yea was just wondering this
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:34:39
it's funny to see the date of information of all of that.. all other are a 31st december 2016 estimate. bitcoin just states NOW
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:51:55
The mempool has stopped decreasing (hit a low on xmas for obvious reasons) but overal fees are decreasing because people are sending tx with lower sat/byte
you don't have to use the highest fees if you can wait a bit.
Sites like  are also usefull as they provide estimates (but I'd do my own research)
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:32:05
that isn't scaling tho.  It will never scale nearly enough.
Also we already have an effective block size increase. It's called segwit. Apparently people haven't decided it's important enough as can be see by it's low usage.
@_date: 2017-12-27 13:34:11
because on chain solutions aren't feasible??
for on chain to be efficient then you have something like VISA.. and that is as far from btc as possible.
Also LN isn't crap. the idea is you have to open a few channels a month at first and who knows about later. If there's a big enough network then you don't need to open that many channels at all
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:03:59
you can still use your wallet and segwit tho. At least at 50%. So when you send from ur SW Wallet to exchange it counts as segwit tx, when you withdraw the other way around it doesn't. 
Still possible even though not optimal.
Or use another exchange maybe
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:41:20
I think you are missing the fact that that one channel will probably be enough to buy all kinds of stuff. Groceries, restaurant, electronics etc, that is, until you run out of money.
Merchants can spend the money they received on that LN without closing the channel (I'm not 100% sure on this but I think so). So If they don't want to cash out they probably can keep it open for a very long time
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:37:35


Miners don't make the coin decentralized. Nodes do.
Will large mining pools survive?? probably yea. Altough I think mining hash power will decrease meaning it will reach a new balance point. And even then if more people abandon the difficulty will just be decreased
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:16:13
if there are enough people running LN nodes (which seems like they will be relatively cheap to run) with at least 3 or so channels then I think It won't be much of an issue as most transactions will be reachable if you just add more hops , increasing fees sure but do you really care if the fee is $0.001 or $0.005 personally I wouldn't care much as like you said opening a channel is the expensive part you could make hundreds of transactions with more hops and it would still be worth it imo.
Yea I think hubs will also exist but they aren't an issue as big as banks. Yea they will deal with a lot of transactions but they have no effective say over them. the protocol ensures that. We don't have to trust the hub, like we do for a bank.
Lastly sorry for the dash on you but it's just gets tiring seeing people here complain how btc doesn't work like visa. Once you add the whole don't trust 3rd party scenario then things get exponentially harder. which is why we need smart yet sometimes a bit confusing solutions like opening channels.
And happy holidays to you and everyone reading this

it's more than that. It's crypto encoded so your private keys are never in direct contact with the network.
It's the best solution for security + convenience.
Just because it looks like a pen don't think it's only a usb flash drive that should cost 2$
@_date: 2017-12-26 05:54:31
the problem is increasing the block size is a very very short term solution. And it has its drawbacks which are already explained in a gazillion websites.
Right now for me the biggest argument for people saying we need bigger blocks is segwit. With **segwit we basically already have bigger blocks all it needs is for people to start using it.** If we had Segwit at very high numbers, and fees super high, and LN still far off on the horizon then I'd consider increasing the block sizes, and I think the devs might aswell because the S2X was a fiasco not because of the block size debate but because of replay protection and etc
Adding more routes is probably what you'd first think of. You'd get more lanes on the highways so you can move more cars right?? Well what happens is now there are tons of cities left out (nodes) because they can't process so many cars. As such you will tend to centralise around bigger and bigger cities. And in a very short period of time you will need to add more lanes to the highways so again more cities left out and then you are getting close to having only a few cities which is very dangerous.
Segwit is basically getting people on buses instead, or car pooling. It's directly related to the number of lanes, but without increasing the lane number you can get more people around if people car pool.
You also have to understand that increasing the block size would take some time and work that it is not then being used for LN. So the question if this really short term solution is a good trade-off in delaying the much more efficient and long term solution that is LN??
If you ever did some coding you know that short term solutions always come to bite you in the ass. Next thing you know it's a shitfest of a code, and you can't really erase everything and start a new and more efficient version afterwards. not with btc
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:11:49
people are also making less tx cuz it's christmas.
Also price relatively stable after that drop the other day
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:45:29
next time you do a transfer use a wallet like electrum and send the change to a segwit address.
you will pay the same high fee you would for the same tx so it's the whole transfering to segwit part is "free".
Now if you aren't transacting from that legacy address it's not biggie because you aren't really contributing to the problem by holding in a legacy address.
additionally if you set a low fee and just wait you won't pay all that much probable. though you could also wait a few days as the mempool has been clearing
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:53:23

12% because people don't use. So apparently it's not that important is it?
Segwit at full adoption isnt 12% increase
@_date: 2017-12-26 14:22:56
Segwit doesn't cause centralisation. it's opt in and allows for much better solutions like LN and the such.. Is that even a question??
Just because both are an effective blockzise increase it doesn't mean they are similar. in fact that's basically the only thing they have in common
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:47:32
centralized solutions are orders of magnitude more efficient. The whole decentralized ledger idea is inneffective by default. Even Andreas has said this.
Also visa has how many years head start?? It will never be as efficient as visa. but it can and will probably be efficient enough. It just needs some time.
The internet sucked ass at first. now do you still use paper letters regularly?

as a fairly recent newcomer (4/5 months) I am super excited for lighting but I find it surprising that it is so rarely talked about..
However I still have some questions as to how it will be implemented (anyone have good, can be technical, videos on that), how will the normal user actually use it and what can I do for it once it launches. I never set up a full node as I don't leave my pc on 24/7 but I'm considering to do that for LN. What are the benefits for the network and for myself if I do that.
Cheers :D
@_date: 2017-12-29 04:03:39


safer yes but that still doesn't mean it is safe
I mean at this point I don't think there's an excuse for anyone with a considerable investment to not own a Hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:55:28
yes but if you are filling up the block with your txs (and your fees) you are not receiving other peoples fees so you are losing on that.
Also you can't really mine every block so you can't get it all back
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:35:40
somehow on GDAX they pay you the fees..idk exactly why but it used to be like that and I've done so a few times myself
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:36:03
no consensus is neede because it is opt-in. If you don't want to use it just don't. The blockchain continues as usual.
You don't open a LN channel for a one-off transaction because it would be more expensive. So in that scenario you just do a normal btc tx.
However what that comment left out is that anyone can run a full LN node, and it seems they won't be that expensive to run. As such you can expect a quite a few nodes which you can use to avoid the big hubs. the whole BB scenario is a bit exagerated imo but who knows how the market will react once it is implemented
@_date: 2017-12-21 22:16:10
It's true though. As much as it hurts it is true. If people were willing to educate themselves they would all use segwit (ok not all but a really vast majority). Instead, that burden falls on bigger companies , which is not much of a problem buut.. when you get companies like coinbase who simply don't give af they can just excuse themselves with that.
Basically 99% of the people will complain about coinbase withdrawal fees (or even normal btc tx fees) but a vast majority won't even adopt segwit until it is "the norm"
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:48:49

then why are you here in this sub exactly?? Sell all your BTC and just leave. No one is asking you for any advice
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:39:11
if you know it's gonna go up then use all the fiat you have to buy btc minus a small amount to buy groceries and pay the rent. Have you done this?? No you probably didn't. because btc has risks. When you buy something with bitcoin you are cashing out a bit.
The rest then you go on a rant about how you can't buy much stuff with btc.. well yea it's still in it's adoption stages. Still you can buy a fair amout of stuff already. The fees are there (especially tx fees) so right now I agree it's not in a good stage, but hopefully in the future vendors will probably do some discounts to people paying in btc because it also benefits them.
But basically the whole arguement of why would you buy stuff with btc when you know it's gonna go up in 6months is BS. If you know that why would you have any fiat yet?? It's a fallacy that keeps on getting repeated by ignorant people.

Coinbase should know that people (especially the users from coinbase which a large majority are beginners to crypto) have no idea what is best for them and what they want.
You ask them about segwit and they go like “Uh?”. If you ask them if they want lower transaction fees then they’ll more likely go “that’s nice yea, I want that”
It’s like saying a child shouldn’t have medicine because it doesn’t want it. The child doesn’t know better 
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:52:14
I think you are correct but you have to take into account the following scneario. Imagine this "net" which is not really a net but who cares.
    Alice \               /Bob
               You - SB  
    Charlie /             \Daryl
Now imagine that all channels are topped with 100$. Imagine Alice pays Bob 99$ then your channel only has 1$ left and as such you can't really buy anything else from SB. Now imagine Daryl also pays Charlie lets say 50$, then that would mean SB would pay you back 50$ and as such you now have a channel with 51$ left.
Stuff like that, if well implemented would mean that channels could stay open for much longer, given that their balances don't go to zero on either parties.
It would me amazing if you could set "directional fees" so that for example, after Alice pays Bob, you can set your fees to zero from any tx coming from SB, because you want to "top" ur channel again and so it's in your best interest.
Now this is all some "idea" I have from what I've read from the LN this seems possible. I'm not sure if it's already planned or plain wrong
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:38:49
yea but the way he worded is like. 
Imagine you have a boat full of holes. He's saying there's no point to covering one hole (segwit) because that won't fix the problem (it will alleviate a bit tho). Ofc you need to cover more holes (LN etc) but you gotta start somewhere
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:36:10


This is so efficient and neat.. I like it!
But I have another question (which because it's late I'm too tired to go google it). I can use  (or should I be using) Electrum with a Ledger?? I'm assuming it just replaces the ledger btc app so I don't have to import private keys and such (as that would defeat the purpose of owning a HW wallet.

@_date: 2017-12-25 02:37:28


ofc we can. We can blame exchanges/wallets for not implementing them and we can blame users for using those same exchanges/wallets.
Also Segwit directly influences the user aswell. It's not a whole if we all do this is better for everyone. That part is true, but even if you are the only one using segwit you still have benefits

Because if you never cash out then you never actually make a profit. Because btc is still risky and volatile. Because if you wanna have money in the bank and not use it be my guest. Because maybe there's actually stuff I can know buy because of btc?
Fees are high and there isn't much adoption atm so yes it's not a good currency RIGHT NOW. The internet wasn't very good at first either. It sucked real bad. There were barely any sites, it was slow and expensive af. Just give it time geezus.

tbh that's a good question. I'm not sure
iirc miners create the block but those are validated by the nodes so according to that the answer should be yes.
But I also recall reading about 51% attacks so I'm guessing it's a no?
If someone more knowledgeable can answer this please ping me or @_date: 2017-12-08 22:23:23
yea this is like saying a highway sucks because there's an accident on the road an now a huge freaking line.. And then on the horizon you see a tiny road with almost no cars and people go like. "that road is alot better. Look at all those 3 cars. they aren't stoping and can go freely. That road is so much better and this one sucks..
And to make it more similar that road has no signs and is in bandit country where you can very easily get robbed or lost.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:48:26


because like said there's really no way to know. Fees could be high-ish or maybe we can also have lots of payments without fees because of some people running nodes.
I'm thinking they will be super low. Not quite free but insignificant probably.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:52:36
transfer through GDAX and they'll pay the fees themselves
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:43:46
flawed argument.
If you know it's gonna go up why do you not buy more?? Why do you have any fiat then?? just buy btc
If you pay 1000$ in btc it's gonna cost you the same because if you had 1000$ in fiat and didn't use them to buy bitcoin at that time then you lost too.
This only applies in one scenario, which is if you have no fiat at all. But in that case then you have to pay your rent with whatever you have so it's a no brainer.
That guy that traded 10k btc for 2 pizzas. People say he lost X million. it's not from that decision. he could have bought the same amout of btc for a very small value in fiat. So just use your bitcoin when you want. if you are gonna think about how much they are worth in the future just buy the same amout back
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:25:14
I like this
It would create some really big spikes on the Sewgwit usage charts when that pool mined a block but I'm guessing that would just increase the PR because people would be like. wtf??
And then said pool could open a donation address. I'd gladly donate a few dollars if they were to help btc as a whole. Especially if I could use a really low fee as they could process it themselves

Just bought my first share of BTC yesterday (only around 90€) pm Coinbase with debit card and just said fuck it for the fees. I'm not buying it to win or lose 2€ so. This morming I'm already in the clear so fees ain't so bad if it saves you time on small purchases I guess.

@_date: 2019-12-27 17:45:42
A really good answer to that is for merchants to pass on some of the savings that they get from their costumers paying in btc to the actual costumers. Even if it's a small %. bitcoin doesn't have physical tokens so it doesn't really matter if a drink is now 4.925$ instead of 5$.
That will more than make for most fees and you get to keep the majority, or a large part of your wealth in btc and get even more benefits by using it.
Nobody is telling someone to get 10$ in btc just to buy a couple of drinks but you also don't need to have all your income in btc to make sense to actually spend/use it.
My view against the argument is that it's always framed as. "That Pizza/Drink/etc ended up costing me X with what btc is worth now". Which is a fallacy. The cost was the same. If btc was that valuable that person could have always bought more, but they didn't because that wasn't their view at the time (hindsight is 20/20). The argument only makes sense if btc is actually impossible or really hard to get. and while it does have limited availability everyone can still get their hands on pretty much how much they desire.
@_date: 2019-12-10 18:57:55
it uses Lightning network so it depends on how you calculate the fees but it could be basically meaningless (as in fractions of a cent)

Bro Visa has "no fee" in your logic so you pay nothing, but the merchant has to pay a x% fee. You are naive to think that you aren't paying the fee. Imagine the fee is 50% the seller will have to increase the value X amount in order to make up for it. You'll still pay "no fee" just because it isn't added there. but it's not free at all.
It's instant for you but not for the seller. Ofc it's not a worry between friends and family but that is a very small percentage of the transactions in the world. Paypal is an escrow service. hence why it has that power. That will be posible for BTC with multisig. 
I don't see much of a point in comparing Paypal with BTC because they differ so much on the principle. One is fully private, everyone is free to enter use and in charge of their own money, and decentralised. The other is centralised, gathers all your data and operates in a totally different way (and yes 1000x more efficient).
A bit of an extreme example is saying that a dictatorship is a much more efficient method of ruling a country. and it's not hard to see why. However your relinquish your freedom for that. If you think that's worth it then it's your call.
Paypal vs BTC is obviously not this extreme but it's not that stupid of a comparison. 
Plus with LN lack of fees and speed argument is getting less and less effective. People keep comparing X with btc of today. ofc btc of today is not yet fully ready for global adoption. People are asking for the technology of tomorrow for yesterday. Internet, cars, Electric cars etc they all sucked hard at first
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:52:10


They don't get it instantly because they are always susceptible to chargebacks. Also if they paid fees like it happens in VISA it's not free on your end either because even if you don't see Value + Fee, the fee is still there and the vendor makes the value accounting for that fee.
Also Paypal.. Look at this:

you don't even have to exit the crypto world to see that though.
There has been numerous reports of banks closing peoples accounts or preventing them from buying crypto. Its your own goddamn money yet banks tell YOU that you can't spend it? I'll buy magical space carrots with my money if I want to.
Besides you are also being very naive. Just because they don't do anything with the power doesn't mean that it's all good. Its like having a leash on your neck and arguing " bro but the leash is so long I can literally go anywhere. Why is that a problem?". It's all good until it isn't. Because governments can shut you down if they want. They can prevent you from spending your own money. Of course that won't happen when times are good, but if something hits then it hits bigtime. And there you will wish you weren't so reliant on governments which have proven to be unreliable many times.

fyi you don't pay fees in transfering from Coinbase to your wallet if you do this
Coinbase &gt;&gt; GDax (same account as coinbase) &gt;&gt; Wallet
Just did this a couple of times. If you check the transaction you see that there is a fee (ofc there must always have a fee, but it is paid by GDax).
I also think (but i'm not 100% correct on this one) that the fee in buying from CC is % based so if he's buying 10$ it actually makes perfect sense to buy on coinbase just because of how easy it is. For higher amounts then the fees will rap up and it isn't really worth it
@_date: 2017-09-20 22:31:53

Surely there was one even if ridiculous. The 12 although it seems odd I can sort of understand. It had the most divisors which helps a lot for common trading

So yea I'm save
Thanks for the clarification :)

Isn’t that what I said in my comment

What do you mean super slow 
As in transactions?
@_date: 2017-09-29 01:32:23
is this the same with the Ledger Nano S? Mine is arriving tomorrow
I can see the added security but then if you lose the passkey its game over?? you can't get your btc

thank god I didn't buy the app.
Now whats the best option for iOS?? Especially with a widget!

I mean having nodes in different countries is always good to further decentralise the network. but any node is good so it's always an advantage
@_date: 2018-02-18 20:29:26


thank fucking god for that.
Also you can buy things with btc. Do your research.
And with bitcoin you don't need to increase the supply. If it ever goes too high that it's not feasible we can just keep dividing it.
Also if you thrash bitcoin that much why are you even here?? Seriously just don't buy and gtfo
@_date: 2017-10-26 19:37:04
By that logic let’s make it so that x satoshi = 1 btc só that there are only 1 trillion satoshi
21 is too weird
@_date: 2018-02-22 13:40:28
by working on it with low fees? aka with time, calm and no pressure.
Instead of having posts like "WE NEED BLOCKSIZE INCREASE NOW". "LN NEEDS TO UP AND RUNNING YESTERDAY" like we did a few months ago.
Now devs can finnaly work in peace
@_date: 2017-10-09 02:33:31
send me a dm and I'll walk you through your first BTC purchase and storage on Discord tomorrow (ima hit the bed now). That way you can ask ALL the questions
@_date: 2017-10-31 18:19:14


I'm pretty sure this is not correct. There will always be adjustments in the difficulty. You don't want very efficient mining. You could easily adjust that by decreasing the difficulty like right now. However that makes the network at risk for 51% attacks and double payments etc hence why it's not done.
Still I'm quite new so this may be wrong
@_date: 2017-10-09 13:55:09
Seeing BTC back on 4.5k+ is calming. I managed to keep calm and hodl all (some days I was a bit worried but I kept my calm and faith) and I even had the balls to buy more along the dip.
Of course now I wished I had just bought more but hindsight is 20/20 so who cares.
@_date: 2017-09-22 17:49:31
Oooh yes plz
Segwit Rocks!!
@_date: 2017-10-26 17:00:27
it irrationally annoys me that there are 100 satoshis in a bit.
Why can't it always be in powers of 3
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:32:50
don't keep the coins on coinbase. Get a mobile wallet at least.
If that sum is quite large then get a hardware wallet
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:10:33
why do you mention gold and not USD? or Euro? How long have these 2 been around?
@_date: 2018-02-24 02:22:19
Scenes when BTC is crashing and you can’t sell because you are too stressed from the crash.
But hey that’s not a bad idea after all. It forces you to hold and only sell when you are calm 
@_date: 2017-09-29 04:14:09
If you are starting now a Segwit wallet is always a good idea so you can save on fees.
Or get a wallet that will get it soon idk.  But it's always nice to have segwit in a wallet
@_date: 2017-09-28 23:31:12
Sorry I'm still a new guy here but if they have the seed don't they have access to all your BTC in that wallet?? or they need the passkey (Which I'm assuming is the pin most wallets use??)?
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:53:54
why?? most of the coinbase users don't even store their BTC there. at least they shouldn't. 
So if they start acting up people just move on because there's nothing holding them to CB
@_date: 2017-09-24 17:00:39
hmm if only you could transfer your BTC out of Coinbase into something you can control.. I guess you could call it, hmm... a wallet?? Yea that sounds right. That would solve all the issues because then Coinbase couldn't screw you anymore..
Unfortunately that isn't possible yet. The technology isn't here 
Edit: Guess I need to leave this here. " \s"
@_date: 2017-10-10 12:30:13
1/4 of a coin is quite a lot of money
At least to me it's no where near small potatoes. It's upwards of 1000$!!
So yea get a hardware wallet asap and I'd reccomend moving those coins to a mobile wallet while you wait for it to arrive. 
But do your reading first!!

From their website they didn't tell me to do any of this.
Sorry for the reply on the old comment but I'm kinda worried now

another vote here!!
I use your wallet, and altough my ledger nano is on the way I'm going to keep it on my phone if I happen to need day 2 day BTC.
The transparency you are showing here is encouraging

damn.. keep us posted. You may be hitting a gold mine here
@_date: 2018-07-30 11:59:16
It’s like voting 
Do you get anything by voting? Not directly. But a small change goes a long way 
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:21:46
yea. like another comment said. 5k won't impact your life that much. so just keep it till you have another use for it. It may skyrocket.
There's that whole thing, "theres not enough BTC for every millionaire in the world to own at least 1 BTC". maybe that 1 BTC might make you one
@_date: 2017-10-25 12:25:57
What the average trader buys is irrelevant to you.
You should buy as much as you are confortable losing. Since you are a college student that won’t be a big amount, but you can always buy 10$ of BTC for example 
@_date: 2017-09-26 01:12:20
yea sure.

it's from one of the videos explaining BTC where Bob pays Alice (or the other way around) 5 BTC for a goddamn lawnmower (or was it 20 BTC ??).
Anyway I find it super funny watching those videos. Like people explaining how wallets work and making test transactions of hundreds of BTC. oh yea just a million dollars or so xD

You know you can just buy the bitcoin back??
He won't regret this purchase because if you are so sure BTC is going up up up just pump all your money into it (and I mean basically all the fiat you have minus what you need to eat).
The only thing he is losing is maybe a couple of dollars on fees
@_date: 2017-09-02 17:09:18
that's a big ass rollercoaster
Looks good
@_date: 2018-02-20 22:00:47
I still don't understand why they dropped segwit at all. Like wtf
Raise the blocksize all you want but removing segwit is borderline idiotic. But hey good for me because that means I can sell all my bch
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:33:41
Paypal is a bad example imo. First of all it shares your data with a gazillion companies. Just that is like yikes,
Second of all there are many countries that don't have it available and being centralised it can ban whoever it wants.
Lastly and most importantly Buyer protections is great for the buyer but it sucks for the (honest) seller. You can chargeback the payment and the seller is screwed. Besides something similar is possible with btc and escrow services. However for both scenarios they require trusting a third party so you can't really compare everything in btc vs paypal as they don't match that much.
One last thing. When you pay with card in a shop even though it clears immediatly for you, their money doesn't get released much much later. so once again for the seller Bitcoin is much much faster
@_date: 2017-10-14 22:31:51


Why do you have any fiat then?? Why not buy more BTC right now?? that is not a good argument at all
Spending BTC is fine and good for all of us. The only downside is maybe you pay a bit more if you have/want to restock on BTC after
@_date: 2017-10-24 22:47:06
I bought at 4500 or so before the ATH 2 months or so ago. Then it wen't dowhill.I also bought on the way down. But 4500 doesn't look as bad now does it ;)
By the end of the year you'll see you made a good call. Not the optimal purchase but a good purchase nonetheless

the amount of energy is not correlated with the number of txs at all.
The energy is used to keep the network secured. If more people start mining then the energy consumed will increase. However more miners aren't really needed.

If you are thinking day to day then yea. Think internationally and the picture changes entirely. Think p2p and there is no question at all.
BTC won't be the day to day currency but the technology behind it will. Some other coin similar to LiteCoin for example will probably be more useful for small purchases

GDAX is owned by the same company as coinbase _(or something like that) so what you do is
Login to GDAX (using same credentials as coinbase).
Deposit BTC on GDAX from your coinbase wallet (This is done on GDAX website)
Withdraw from GDAX to your wallet (mobile, hardware paper whatever). There are fees (of course) but they are paid by GDAX/Coinbase.
look it up if you need. there are videos about it

what? this isn't true post fork
you have X BTC now.
Fork happens
Now you have X BTC and X WhateverCoin
they are then completely seperate. Now you can sell all you Whatever coin and keep your BTC intact (or buy more xD)
@_date: 2017-10-26 16:34:15
I don't agree with this.
Why is BTC competing with fiat and why doesn't that apply to the internet?
E-mail competes with regular mail. Now it kinda doesn't but at first e-mail was terribly confusing.
BTC is just a technology aswell.
One important thing people are forgetting here is security. A vendor can overcharge you with regular credit card. You might not even notice. They take YOUR money without even asking for it. You think that's ok?
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:29:13
rule of thumb is about 500$ worth. But bear in mind that if you have 500$ in BTC atm this can mean a much higher value in the future.
A hardware wallet is about 80-100$. so see if it justifies that for sums like 300$ etc

what I always tell them is. If that GPU is 100$ more expensive now it's because it's probably worth it. So why don't you buy the GPU and mine with it on the off-time to compensate the increased costs.
They are just too bitter and I've given up. Let them be salty and trash Bitcoin. It's not gonna matter much

I haven't played Dota 2 in like a year, nor followed the scene but apparently it is a team called
FlyToMoon 
I'm guessing it's a newly formed team and they still haven't gotten a sponsor. Dota 2 allows you to create any team name and you can set the images for those banners you see in the image, and they probably chose the BTC logo.
It's quite normal for these teams to have fun names etc until they get in touch with a sponsor

I once went to a test review in my university. One of teachers (the one in charge for that subject, and it wasnt' an unimportant subject either, but quite the contrary), was writing down all the grade changes on a goddamn printed excel sheet (which was probably used by the other teachers hence why he had one). but seriously he would write over the cell for each problem (in the paper) and then update the total sum at the end too.
I was baffled
