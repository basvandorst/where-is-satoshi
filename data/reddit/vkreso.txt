As I've said in another thread:
MRW I read this 
 "setting up common sense rules for our protection" LOL
This is an extremly bad regulation which goes against any "common sense" spirit of the law created in the past 3000 years if not more. This kind of regulation only prostitute the law and give any student of law a bad name.
 If any regulation is to be done regarding digital currencies it should only be taken from the practice of its use (as more then 90% of trade law is) not the bureaucratic pen in bed with big money. Also, bitcoin is already regulated, and the mathemathics behind it's code and the technology of blockchain is it's form.
Good intentions are commendable but as they say, the road to hell is paved with them..

Agreed, I really don't see it as a problem.
