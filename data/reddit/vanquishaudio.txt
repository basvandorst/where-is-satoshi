What would happen if we increased the block size while the network was super congested? Would that fix the delay for all new transactions? 
Do we have to wait for every big miner to agree to one update before everyone starts updating their Bitcoin client? What would happen if only a fraction of Bitcoin nodes updated their software? 
I'm not too technically proficient in Bitcoin so excuse me for poor terminology!

@_date: 2015-05-04 13:28:23
If Bitcoin price was stable at this point or earlier, people would recognize it as a stable store of value and pour their money into it, causing the price to hike, and then of course many will take their money out, causing a downward momentum, so you see at this early stage it's hardly possible for price stability.  These fluctuations are natural in a new currency and at the same time absolutely essential to its survival.  Manic speculative bubbles are what attracts the mainstream.  If you look up Bitcoin on Google trends the graph representing searches of the term "Bitcoin" is identical to bitcoins historic price graph.  Not a coincidence.  These surges in attention bootstraps Bitcoins momentum.  In time, the market for Bitcoin will gain enough liquidity where huge buys and sells will have only a small effect on the price.  May take a few years but it will happen.  In the mean time I look at Bitcoin as a superior store of value.

Each Bitcoin can be divided 100 million times, so even though there's only 21 mil there's actually 21mil x 100mil units tradable, more than enough for everyone to use.

Anyway a fixed supply doesn't really mean anything if it's infinitely divisible.  There aren't really 21 million bitcoins but 2,100,000,000,000,000 satoshis. That's 250,000 units of value for each person on Earth.  If we need more we will divide the numbers further through consensus.  This is a non-issue!

I scanned the bitpay barcode on the website with the coinbase app and hit confirm. Luckily I don't own that many bitcoins and coinbase has a limit of sending 2500 btc a day, but this might spell a shitstorm for another user. I went to settings and switched unit from bits to btc and the issue went away. Someone tag coinbase staff so they're aware of this issue please! 
@_date: 2015-08-08 22:48:46
The address is generated by bitpay. I just scanned their QR code with coinbase.

I don't store my Bitcoin on coinbase, I just use it for purchasing, they have an auto replenish feature. 
@_date: 2015-08-09 15:44:02
As long as coinbase still works here, no need to move.

@_date: 2015-08-09 17:38:00
So when I change bits to btc in the coinbase app and scanned the same QR code and got the proper amount to pay for Louis CK's special, does the virus know I did that? Is this some sort of quantum field observer changing wave function virus?

We should start a thread showing proof of support for the block size upgrade fork.  The quickest and most effective way to gather consensus is to show people that there really isn't much to debate if all the biggest entities in Bitcoin naturally support much needed expansion. 
Just a quick ELI5 (explain like I'm 5): XT is currently identical to Bitcoin core.  IF at least 75% of nodes are running XT on or after January 11, 2016, the XT blockchain will fork to include bigger blocks, which Bitcoin core will no longer support.  If 75% isn't reached, there's no fork and both versions stay compatible.  
What we want is a seamless transition with well over 90% of the nodes updated by 2016.  So to quell any confusion, Mike Hearns bullet list of supporters needs references, the best one being proof of an upgrade to XT.  If I was on the fence about updating my node or Bitcoin client and then witness an overwhelming majority of wallet developers and exchanges showcasing their support, I probably wouldn't want to be responsible for endangering Bitcoin and stay in the minority.  I'd follow suit.

Any other form of investment other than bitcoin or crypto currencies in general is centralized (other than gold which is not a practical payment method) and can be easily manipulated if the central authority chooses to let's say issue more stocks driving price down etc. The reason many investment vehicles seem to be stable or growing is because of false confidence from the public and artificially inflated values stemming from newly printed fed money which goes straight to Wall Street to perpetuate a global finance bubble. Bitcoin seems to be the only safe haven in the foreseeable future. 
Edit: also want to add that the balance between new buyers and "dumper whales" will eventually shift and of course the fear in holding Bitcoin will dissolve as well. Also early adapters will need a new Maserati from time to time and they don't accept Bitcoin yet. 
@_date: 2015-10-17 20:32:35
@_date: 2015-03-24 02:25:23
Yep, I've made a cold wallet via a raspberry pi and bitaddress. Probably the cheapest way to go about it. Highly recommend!

@_date: 2015-03-24 17:02:24
You need to hold Bitcoin before you can sell it to move price down. Millions of dollars can get you a lot of Bitcoin but it will be hard to acquire without driving the price back up. You can always steal large amounts and sell that but that option will inevitably phase itself out as security evolves and people take more precaution. Over time as Bitcoin grows the ability to manipulate it's price will become increasingly difficult.

Gross attitude. Transacting in Bitcoin doesn't bring the price down. Only when merchants exchange btc for dollars but most people replenish what they spend anyway.

@_date: 2015-03-24 17:33:06
Actually right now a Bitcoin can be divided 100 million times, the smallest unit being called a satoshi. If you multiply 21 mil x 100 mil and then divide by 7 billion people, every person in the world holds 300,000 satoshi, so there's enough units of value to go around.

I already see more value in it than having 5k in cash
@_date: 2015-03-24 04:01:04
Happy to answer that.
Bought one of these off amazon
As well as a memory card to install the operating system (this one was perfect because it's a 2 in 1)
The OS I used is raspbian and can be dled for free.  
I hooked up the pi to my tv via hdmi cable and used a wireless usb keyboard and mouse for it.
Downloaded the offline files from bitaddress.org and transfered them to the raspberry pi via usb drive. 
I could then open the site on my tv screen and generate a private and public key which has never touched the Internet. Wrote them down in a notebook and that's basically the only place the private key exists. I could then send Bitcoin to the public address and the network recognizes and records this. It's pretty wild that the network knows a public key is real even though it's never been online. I guess that's the magic of cryptography. The only way I could use the funds is if I load up the private key into an online wallet but then it will no longer be completely secure.
Here's a pic I took while setting it up feeling like Neo:

@_date: 2015-02-23 12:46:38
Still better than perpetual debt.  After the dollar inevitably collapses, a deflationary economy will actually incentivize people to be creative in their money earning, instead of using money the bank says is actually there but isn't.  People by large aren't responsible enough to pay back their debts hence this perpetual crisis we like to ignore. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:29:52
This sounds simple enough but it would be best to generate it on an offline computer correct? So can I do it on the raspberry pi I posted and connect and old printer to it somehow?
@_date: 2015-03-24 04:03:25
Only 21 million will ever exist

You're obviously not referring to my post I made a minute before yours right.. I thought it was obviously partial sounding. I only use coinbase but I think people should be ready for anything.

Bitcoin is backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized distributed computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). Dollars are not backed by gold anymore since long time ago, they are printed by the trillions out of nothing by the private institution called "Federal" Reserve.
Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:
Almost for free (a few cents fee).
Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
Securely (encrypted cryptographically)
Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
Open source (auditable by anybody)
Worldwide (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet).
Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
