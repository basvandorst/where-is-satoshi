Hi All, 
I got this two days ago after I registered as a new account holder for only a week and then was traveling through NYC.  They won't let me into my account, so how can I close it? Sent them so many messages no response. Extremely unethical not to respond to their customers when I have open margin positons. Imagine if a real bank or a trading on wall street did this, it would be considered illegal. 
Does anyone know what Poloniex likely did with my account? Are the values of my currencies frozen? Cashed out immediately?

Poloniex locked me out of my account and told me I had to close my account but since april 18th when they locked me out, hey have not allowed me into my account. Sent numerous messages. Now have found through the excel spreadsheet that they have sold my positions as ltc was rising. Any advice? I'm thinking of filing a SEC complaint or contacting a free lawyer if such services are available
