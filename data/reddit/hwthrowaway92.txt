Xrp reached $3, now its at 31 cents.
Its realized capitalization is more than its market capitalization.
In other words, on average, every xrp holder is a bagholder right now. 
And as it slids downwards, they become even bigger bagholders.

I did some satire, on for a few days I was active there.
everyday I'd write a comment saying something like "I just bought 10% more xrp today". Every day in their daily thread.
in the end, I was going to "reveal" that my total investment after days of increasing my "stast" by 10/20% was $9 or so.
but before the big reveal, the mods banned me, cause I became careless and admitted in a comment that I was satirising the xrp bagholders. 
Overall, it was fun, cause they upvoted all my satirical comments.

You had me at recession. It was mentioned at the end, but thats all good.

which is more than 1% of all mined bitcoins.

If you have X amount of bitcoin, that will remain X forever. You can't increase it under the Bitcoin protocol. 
There are other coins, which have different protocol called PoS, where by putting forth some coin, you get more of it. 
But since that does not happen with btc, you can't increase it like that. There is no compounding of any kind with bitcoin.
so if btc price in market grows up by a factor of 2, your stash will also do that.

1. create new bitcoin wallet. 
2. transfer all your coins to new wallet.
Thats the most important steps.
Then you get the wallet for bitcoin cash, and enter your old wallet keys to access your bcash coins. sell them all, or move them all. 
do the same for rest.

that's a personal attack. And its not a good argument, that there are people who don't know what a yellow light is in their car, so bitcoin must be good.
winknewoi brothers were millionaire before they got into crypto, and they'd be billionaires now.
Similarly, for a lot of folks.
indeed, its arguable that 4% of world population (americans, who are richer than average), owning lets say 50% of coins(which is a fair guess), is a sign of worse disparity than their share in world economy, which won't be higher than 20%.

similar client story: four years ago I replied to a new client email, with a helpful link to a free solution (which saved him money/time).
Without me even asking for it, he paid me for one hour of my time with 0.07 btc (which was $20 then). 
That was perhaps my first real bitcoin input, shall I call it. I never mined or bought bitcoin, only earned online. 
I got a small fortune in btc now with what I earned online. It'll have a happy ending when I'm able to sell it. Having never traded/sold btc, I'm not sure how easy its gonna be. doesn't help I'm in india, where btc is literally banned. Lets hope for the best.

you don't get very basic fact why PoS is preferred by vitalik etc now for eth: because in PoW, the token eth itself can have zero value, but still the tokens built on top of it can have high/positive value, and the miners can be paid by anything except eth.
Thats why they want to move to PoS, which, in their understanding, will gnve non-zero value to eth.

You seem right on the face of it.

PoW is there in religion too. 
The original christian fathers/bishops invented (or borrowed) the concept of celibacy to strengthen their claim to religiousness.

Assuming one btc was $1 then, the odds now for us are 1000 to 1.

so many scammers trying to make money off of regular people.
In stocks, the same thing used to happen, so government came up with securities and exchange commission, which regulates markets. 
there is absolutely zero regulation in "crypto" space. token owners are so ignorant, that they brag that "their" token **isn't** a security.
What they don't recognize is that any chump can create a company and release a coin, and lie about their goals, as many do, and sell his coins to bagholders.
and that has happened, (whats called ico craze), but its **still happening**. 
and that is a problem because so many people lose money to scammers, millions of them, and they never come back to use crypto. 
that was about scammers. 
also, people think that they're buying currencies of the future. 
as if the world needs 2000 more currencies.
I think this delusion that we need more and more tokens/currencies is also a problem, because in the end we end up with bagholders.

If you look here: 
I see that an average of 20 transactions per day are happening (in whole of crypto.). so btc is about 10 per day.
That's just one service. for only australians. and only for airport travelers.
Overall, I'd estimate there to be about 500 australian transactions like that. Cause how many times a year do we fly?
so if australians are making 500 transactions a day, then the whole us, europe, japan etc have to make at least 40 times that (going by population ratio). 
so that means about 40 x 500 = 20k bitcoin transactions are being made everyday.

but ethereum is going to proof of stake now. 
if coca cola owns more ether than pepsi, pepsi may decide to not use ether chain.
they may want to start their own chain. 
since the job of ethereum chain is to just run programs, pepsi could just make minor modifications in ethereum source code and create their own chain.
bitcoin is different: its a payment network. people will naturally want to go with the biggest one. that's just efficient (within limits). 
but as a computational network, anyone can hire 20 servers and start running dapps of their own on chain. 
just as we can today hire amazon servers, or azure, similarly people would be able to hire different chains.

@_date: 2017-11-28 09:24:46
Yes, you only need the 12 word seed for electrum to access your wallet. 
Ledger wallet or any hardware wallet is needed because viruses etc could steal your seed by screenshotting your machine. Or by other such attacks. Ledger seed is never shown on laptop so it can't be stolen by software means alone.

Arranged marriages don't always fail like mine. They do work mostly. 
Also, arranged marriage is a misnomer. In almost all arranged marriages in present age the girl and guy are given a chance to know each other at least a little bit, and say no if they don't like the other person. No marriage is totally arranged. There is always choice to say no ( or yes).

I had five months to talk to the girl, to know her, and say no if I wanted. Obviously it wasn't enough, and I failed to really know her fully. But that's my own failing, not of the system of arranged marriage. I did not act responsibly. Responsible thing was to know her and her family very well before I said yes.

I had 10% of my portfolio in eth. But I sold it in July. Best move I made, because btc has jumped 4x since then, but eth has not moved. 
The thing is that eth is really a very experimental technology. The math behind btc is foolproof. But eth contracts are written in your own languages, which can lead to bugs. This makes it inherently insecure.
Also, its not going to be a store of value. That will just be bitcoin, or a bitcoin like coin. (99% that it will be btc over next few decades). 
I am 99% invested in btc, and 1% in ltc, so you can see my biases. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:40:35

1. Programming the wallets is not trivial. I suppose chrome apps could be written, but I am not sure. In any case, its out of realm of possiblity unless you want to spend millions in that effort. 
2. depends on person to person. I have tens of thousands worth of btc, and I just got a ledger nano s. I am sure others got it for lower amounts, and there must be people who don't have hardware wallets and who hold millions of dollars in paper wallets. 
3. I'd estimate 5 times what it is today.

Depends on where you stored your bitcoins. Lot of online wallets or accounts have gone down over time, such as mtgox website. 
Bitcoin by itself does not get deleted over time. They remain where they are unless moved by someone. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:27:35

But I am not from a developed country. 
For me and people like me, Bitcoin is the easiest thing to own if I want some security against the 5-10% inflation that plagues Indian Rupee. 
And the cumulative effect of people like me alone is enough to give some value to Bitcoin. 
Even if no American or western person ever wants to buy Bitcoin, people from developing country alone will combine together to create an international market of holders of bitcoins. They will do this to escape their badly controlled currencies and corrupt governments. 
We have no idea what we have here right now. Nationalism is in its death spiral, because there will be no wars now due to nuclear entente. Then what can governments do to enforce their power? nothing. They can't go to war, so they can't safeguard their currencies against runs.

don't buy some large sum and then withdraw to your electrum. if you lose the private keys, you'll lose everything. 
first play with small amounts.
about your question, you need to use one of your recieve addresses in bitcoin. put that address in the exchange where you want to withdraw from. 
your bitcoin addresses (there are unlimited number of such addresses in one electrum wallet. but at a time only 20-30 are seen), are where your coins will be stored.
@_date: 2017-11-28 10:25:48
first you save your coins in your wallet on electrum. (just fyi, you can create multiple wallets on electrum). The electrum's seed is 12 word long, and cannot be imported into ledger. 
then you create a new wallet on your ledger when it comes. this wallet has a totally new 24 word seed, that is only shown on the ledger's small screen. so only know it, its not even displayed on your laptop. Save it well. 
Then you transfer bitcoins from your electrum wallet to your ledger wallet. 
If you want, you can import your ledger's 24 word seed into your electrum and access all the funds from electrum; but thats' not at all advisable. I am just telling you that it can be done.

That's not how it works. Fact is that in almost all exchanges, all the alt-coins are traded AGAINST bitcoin. They rise with bitcoin, and fall with bitcoin. Same is the case with litecoin. I own 1% of my portfolio in litecoin, so thats the only altcoin I track. And I expect it to keep pace with Bitcoin.

Most good software is open source. 
Electrum is a software wallet, and its code is available on github.
People have verified by code review that its genuine. And contains no malware by reviewing it. You can do that too. 
So you can just download that code and use it.
Then there are applications. Like electrum-setup.exe.
There is a thing called md5 hash. In case you download an application such as this, you need to verify the md5 hash of the application, to make sure you got the right application. (this doe;not safeguard you in case the application itself was malware. That safeguard is only available with open source software).

Ethereum is over rated. Because its build over very insecure programming tech stack. People write buggy contracts all the time in it, and it shows that it cannot take over the contract space. It will be replaced by something much more secure over time. 
Litecoin is good. Bitcoin is best. I am invested 99% in btc and 1% in ltc. 
I haven't researched any other coin. The thing is that its really hard to judge any coin without having inside information about the founders, their capabilities, their drive, etc. You need inside information to make good calls with altcoins.

If a hedge fund manager wants to invest $100 million in a crypto, the first thing he will want to make sure is that his money can't be stolen. Bitcoin is secured by its ever increasing [hash rate]( To steal even one bitcoin, any government or attacker will have to spend billions of dollars. Other smaller cryptocurrencies can be faked with lower barriers.  
Bitcoin is the most secure, because it is the biggest, by a huge margin. That is one factor that makes it preferable to other coins when you want to save money using some crypto. 
And logically, no other coin will be able to overtake bitcoin, because bitcoin will always have this advantage as long as more and more people keep coming to it.

I mean, I personally believe very strongly that Bitcoin will go 10 times in price in next 3 years or so, but I am still not buying any more. 
One reason is that I don't have any cash at all to spend on bitcoin. But logically, I should take a loan and buy bitcoin. But I am not doing that.

eth and xrp are in a freefall relative to btc. 
gonna get their just desserts. 
people who think they will recover, by what logic?
institutions are going to buy the the safest chain. not ha'penny tokens which aren't safe from the largest attackers. There is absolutely no logic why eth and others should increase with btc price, when their chain safety is not in the same league as bitcoin. 
also, according to Adam Back, bitcoin should be 90% of total crypto marketcap. 
I agree totally.

Imo, Arranged marriages only work in a communal culture.
When people live in nuclear families, you need compatibility of nature. 
I'm not even talking of love. Just basic compatibility should be there. Or there should be a "meeting of minds", to borrow a legal term. 
Overall I think communal living is the best, but modern life compels us to live in nuclear families and sometimes totally alone. Its not good for mental health, thats why there is so much depression etc in modern society. Its possible the internet will create a new kind of communal living and culture.

I'm pretty sure he was swedish. my main point is number 2.
1. He used american as well as british spellings. meaning he was neither. 
2. His last post was about wikileaks. he said "wikileaks has kicked the hornets nest...(and so I'm going now bye bye). The term "hornets nest" is such a rare term to use in a forum, that I've never actually read it on reddit for example. The most probable source of that term is the book "The girl who kicked the hornet's nest", which was translated into english in 2009. A literary Swede would have known of that title. So my **guess** is he picked it from that book, and that he was a Swede.
Already it has been known from his forum posts' timestamps that he followed UK/europe time.
ergo, he was a Swede.

Don't let average income mislead you. Indians own a lot of savings. Especially in form of gold.

I am willing to take some risk, but my problem is that I have some expenses coming up, so I need the cash. If my financial situation was better, I'd be totally taking a loan. 
In fact, I did take a loan of $1500 in November 2016, instead of selling my bitcoin that I had then. That $1500 that remained invested in bitcoin is now worth $15000 (since I barely sold any). 
I still have to pay $750 of that Rupee loan that I had taken. I am from India. I don't even have $750 in rupee to return that loan. I have some tens of thousands of dollars in bitcoin.

Thats the worst analysis possible.

Bitcoin does not create any growth. Its a method of saving money. It does not displace stocks. It displaces cash and other money that is kept in banks.

To summarize, he says that Bitcoin 
* is preferred by the younger people as a store of Value. He mentions his daugher who is a CS major, and who prefers Bitcoin over Gold. 
* His main, conservative, estimate is that Bitcoin will be $25k a coin. He bases this on conservative hypothesis, that 5% of all money that today uses gold as store of value will be invested in Bitcoin. 
* is very rare, because despite the fact that there are 17 million bitcoins, a lot of them are held by what are called holders, who do not sell their coins. So its a rare commodity, and when more money goes after rare commodity ( such has been seen in oil), it can see spikes. He mentions price of $75k per bitcoin in case of such spike.

Bitcoin does pose a threat to any government issued currency or system, because it can be used to bypass taxes of all kinds. However, there has to be an equibilirium, at which point governments will start to make moves to control its growth. I just happen to think that *its likely*  that such equilibrium will reach when Bitcoin will be valued close to gold. Because that is also heavily taxed and controlled by governments. In India, government levies 10% import duty on gold, to limit its purchase. Thats the kind of control government will try on bitcoin too.

No country can declare btc as its currency. Doing that would mean any tom dick and harry with a few btc can come to that country and buy anything. Why would they allow that?

Another great news. Bitcoin market capitalization just crossed 50% of the total cryptocurrency market capitalization. 
Bitcoin was at 80% around Dec 2016. Then it dropped to 40-42% around April 2017 or around that. Since then it has been rising. 
It should again touch 80%.
