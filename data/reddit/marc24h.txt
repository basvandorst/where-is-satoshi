Gdax and Coinbase are the same. Coinbase is the more "user friendly" side of Gdax

You keep saying that "PayPal's actual cost is close to zero". You list the reasons that justify cost of transmission of bitcoins, but forget to list paypal's costs:
- electricity
- employees
- hardware, servers, physical stuff that costs money
- offices
- many things that I cannot think about
- ...
And on top of that, their fees. That's why 12.9% will never become close to zero. (Paypal's monthly burn rate was $10 million a month in year 2000!)

The post that you are responding to says that that paypal keeps between 2.9% and 12.9% of the amount of the transaction and you still say that it is "technically zero"?


aw god

I have received all kinds of errors when operating in both kraken.com and trade.kraken.com. To me, it looks like the API is buggy / overloaded. In the last minutes, I have received:
* 820: Internal error What it means: Our service failed for an unpredictable reason, for example the response from the exchange’s API was garbled.
* 821: Unknown error
What it means: This is a catch-all error for when the exchange’s API returns an error but our system doesn’t understand what it means.
* **800: No response from API** What it means: We’re failing to get a response from the exchange’s API. This usually gets resolved with time.
Do you guys use Kraken?

That's what I use. I keep getting responses to my ordrers like "API error 802" etc.

I finally transferred all my bitcoin to GDAX. Less tools, but they work.
My life is easier now!

Oh! you were so wrong! It's $7,200 already ;)
Any new forecasts?
