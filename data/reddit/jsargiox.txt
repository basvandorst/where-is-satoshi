I think this is what happened:
Eduard copied the hash to pass it to someone, later, he was browsing and found an amazing quote and tried to copy it, but instead he pressed Alt+C (nothing happened). Went to twitter (all excited about sharing that amazing piece of wisdom) and pasted what was in his clipboard (the hash) and pressed enter before he realized about what was in the tweet... I mean, shit happens.
Or he was just messing with people...

They can get paid, but, countries like Venezuela and other latin american countries will take big cuts on international payments coming *in* and because federal reserves are usually very low and need the cash they will convert -at their arbitrary rate- your dollars into local currency... so your dollars... not actually *your* dollars anymore

Lookup "cepo cambiario", will find plenty of results, it looks like after 12 years you can buy dollars in venezuela. You can also check argentina's cepo...

Sorry for the noob(?) question, but what will be the "thing" to mine. I mean there won't be any bitcoin available, but you still have to work on the "math"?

Another noob question from me... and after those 20 years, transactions will become slower to confirm? given the fact that only 0.4% of coins will be mined on a "80 years window" (I understand 100 years is not an exact value but rather a way of saying a long time)
