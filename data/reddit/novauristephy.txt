I encourage you to give [this thread]( a read, though, and create paper wallets or look into services that let you control your private keys instead of pooling funds through a larger service like these. Insurance doesn't cover everything that people think it does. If it isn't Circle's or Coinbase's fault, it's your responsibility and uninsured.
