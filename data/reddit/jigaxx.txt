I remember seeing that story floating around just a couple of months before the November 2013 run-up.

I like what you did with the indirect dogecoin plug.

Alright sounds good. I will be in Dar on the first week of August, I'll keep checking back for an update.

I would call it an intellectual blind spot. Only time will sort things out. In the meantime lets just keep educating. I've noticed that some people get irritated when they can't grasp a concept.

I don't see the date for the meetup.

Well, if you have no need then you just have no need to use it. But its good that you're asking questions though. Keep in mind that not everyone in the world lives in a comfy bubble like yours. If that was the case, there would be no need for bitcoin.

I got this email too. I didn't click on the link in the email. Usually, when you get an email soliciting you to log into your account, it's a huge red flag.
I deleted the email and marked it as spam.

Nope. Not everyone.

I agree. I just purchased a laptop from TigerDirect last night.

Don't be discouraged by the comments here. I would say its a good start. Please do some more designs and keep sharing. Also use coinbase or bitpay to streamline your payment process.

Yeah, let's break the currency away from the blockchain.


But lets utilize the blockchain technology to use this other currency. 
-Fucking infuriating!

I'm not sure you read the article. If you did, what don't you agree with? Because it looks like he only mentioned about past technological innovations that persevered over a long term and how we take them for granted today. He points out a parallel with Bitcoin saying it is going through the process of growth and it will take small steps over the long term to reach adoption. 
Edit: I disagree with your grammar.

Me too. Cocaine is a hell of a drug!

Buddy, I would like to argue with you right now but that will be counterproductive. If you would like to learn more about how bitcoin works there are plenty of good people here to answer your questions or point you to some great learning resources.

Same here, older than OP but I find Dogecoin so much more appealing.

I would consider the people on Yahoo as the late majority because they still use Yahoo.

Black guy here. Cool cool cool man!
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:32:19
I'm black and I've been following Bitcoin since summer 2013. I've purchased a laptop from Tigerdirect, tons of gift cards from Gyft, an airline ticket from Cheap Air using Bitcoin. I've been looking at Bitcoinj, BitcoinJS and tons of interesting crypto projects. So, I'm here, actively looking, learning and participating anyway I can. 
Joke: We are mostly into Blackcoin though.

This is super great. Now I don't have an excuse for not taking the time to read it.
