If you are in CoinBase, you could click on Buy/Sell, then Bitcoin, and select the USD wallet as method of payment. Unfortunately, they charge a 4% fee, which is ridiculous. 
Go to GDAX .com, which is CoinBase's own exchange, deposit USD from CoinBase account, and buy Bitcoin with a market order for fees well under 1%. Or use Limit Orders to buy for zero fees.
Also, there are all sorts of unofficial Youtube tutorials for this out there

Make sure to sell everything when the price goes down and to re-invest when the price goes back up, you wouldn't want to own any assets that aren't valuable

Next year.. typically people try to guess the next bubble peak but I'm guessing for exactly 1 year from now

78k on new years

I think this is largely why we are seeing large losses across the board. When everyone is 100% in, the only way to go is down.

Selling at 19.5k would be so risky though... if it broke 20k then there were no existing sell orders to stop the price from skyrocketing

I agree that Ver is a greedy asshole with this whole BCH thing, but this just a bunch of propaganda and lies. He was arrested by off-duty FBI agents for no good reason, then they discovered that he sold fireworks on ebay and put him behind bars for 10 months over it. That's not the same picture that you're trying to paint at all.

It broke through to 19.4k minutes after this post and now it's bouncing everywhere like mad. If we break the sell wall at 20k there are no existing sell orders to limit how high it can go..... buckle up and prepare for launch everyone this is going to get crazy

You'd need your dad as well as his ID. From what I recall Coinbase verification requires a right-then-and-there photo

This is the top reply!

This nothing.... Go to the depth chart and zoom all the way out..
There is less than 2,000 bitcoins up for sale in limit orders (&amp; etc) above market price right now
The total up for buying below market price is over 10,000 which totals over $70,000,000,000, and that's only what is posted right now on GDAX
It might not hit $10,000 USD tonight, but if it does hit $9,000 then that will be in the news tomorrow and there will be no limit as to how high it can go in the next few days. THEN we can talk about fear of crashing...

This comment is 3 minutes old and already hasn't aged well XD

I was thinking the same thing. 
At one point a few hours ago Bitcoin was at over 11,000 on Bithumb and only 9500 at most other places including Gdax, where you can buy with no fees. Unless the transfer fee + the Bithumb selling fee is over 10% then you could just do that repeatedly for hours and make profit like mad in no time at all!

Huh, how unusual.
Now that I think of it, its' probably a bot that's learning how to make aged accounts for those reddit propaganda companies
