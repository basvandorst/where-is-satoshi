I wonder if this in hopes of good news out of the Conference...

Anyone know why google spreadsheets can't access these anymore? I always get an SSL error even with the updated api address.

This I did not know. It's also the first piece of evidence that has made me reconsider my position on the riskiness of MtGox. Thank You.

Can you explain this? I really don't see the risk of Mt Gox funds being confiscated being any higher than on any other exchange. Mt Gox itself is not in US. Making it pretty difficult for the US Gov to shut them down.

If they seize MtGox as you suggest what makes you think that you'd be safe in any other the other exchanges?

I have 2 factor authentication enabled. I keep the passwords in a PGP encrypted file on the computer only decrypted while I copy and past the password.

You are not alone. In an over simplified comment I can provide 1 counter argument. Africa has very little regulation Europe has tons of regulation. Where would you rather live?

I suppose a space could've been the issue. Downside is I have to wait till tomorrow to try. Blockchain has locked out the account for 24 hours.

True it is sometimes the norm but it was interesting to see the 120 wall dissolve and a 118 backstop wall went up right away. I find it surprising given the spread between Gox and the other exchanges.

I accept that by standard evaluations it may be over priced I would argue  that the speculation is not irrational. Bitcoin possesses the potential to be an incredibly disruptive force in the financial sector.

While I agree that using only BTC would limit donators, it's not an all or nothing choice. You could allow people to contribute to the projects using Paypal or BTC. Clearly using Paypal can be risky, they have a history of freezing accounts without any forewarning. 
Agree or disagree yours is a valid argument and as such not worthy of downvote.

You can still move dollars out of mtgox. The only thing you can't do is use Dwolla. Can still do a wire transfer no problem, unless there has been some new development

Seems really odd that it's taking a dive, there has been a lot of promising news from lately about investment from VC's and possibly paypal.

Thanks this cleared it up :)

I was unaware of the subreddit. I'll be sure to post further discussions of the sort in their correct location.

Great post! I gotta say I really liked getting the perspective a banker on these issues. Could you expand on what You mean by:
"If the bank can’t have a nice and neat paper trail of the funds then they will not be in compliance with AML/KYC and face fines."

I wouldn't use a US exchange. But I also found there isn't enough volume being traded on the Canadian exchanges to make day trading profitable. My main question though was an attempt to challenge the reasoning "MtGox account has been seized! Quickly get your money out of MtGox and into a safe US exchange." 
@_date: 2013-08-20 20:22:27
That's what I've getting for about 20 min.

You can still just wire money to MtGox. Although its somewhat concerning to hear about this and Liberty Reserve happening so close close together.
@_date: 2013-05-10 03:39:25
I would also be interested in the answer to this question.

If your looking to move 1000s of BTC the only market is MtGox. Take a look at the volumes on the various exchanges over the last couple of weeks and it looks like you'd have a hard time moving that volume anywhere other mtGox.
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:05:22
I certainly agree with having the trading more distributed, it would help to decentralize BTC a bit further. I guess I just didn't see Dwolla as being that important when you can still just do a wire transfer
