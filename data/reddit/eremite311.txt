This is exactly why bitcoin is plummeting. In the case of a currency collapse, people who are barely scraping by will be on survival mode. Which means, buying food, physical goods. Nobody is going to be holding bitcoins if they think hard times are ahead and are in danger of losing job or not paying rent. Certainly will not be buying aggressively into speculative assets on a prayer. Poor, desperate people most likely not very tech savvy, or not holding enough money to cause a spike in bitcoin. People will be on conservation mode, and running out of all speculative assets. If bitcoin was $30,000 today, they might be buying into it. But it's $3600, which means, retail investors will be dumping this further down as they are best at selling low and buying high.

As a business owner, I can tell you, that just because you are making good money now, doesn't mean it will be producing good income in the future. Average profit margin of S&amp;P 500 company is about 11%, however, if sales drops 30% that can easily mean your are having a loss producing business and you will keep on bleeding cash in a downward spiraling economy. In this case, having a currency like "bitcoin" might be better bet. Since stock prices are discount cash flow of future. And say a stock was $100 and EPS of $5 a share, if that turns into -$5 and stay there for a year or two, very real possibility that shareholder equity would be eroded to next to nothing, and your stock price might as well be trading at $1 or less. What should be a price of a company trading at -$5 a year EPS and losing more with shareholder equity gone?
