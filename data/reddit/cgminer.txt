Ok here is how it works.
Given address A.
If you send 2 BTC, 3 BTC and 5 BTC. Now the total balance of A is 10 BTC which consists of 3 different unspents 2,3 and 5.
If you want to send someone 4 BTC, you have multiple choices...
* you can combine 2 and 3, send 4 BTC to new address and 1 BTC to A
* you can use 5, send 4 BTC to new address and 1 BTC to A
* you can use 2,3 and 5, send 4 BTC to new address and 6 BTC to A
etc...

You don't need to sync the blockchain to get information out of your wallet.
Just load it up and do listaddressgroupings or listbyreceived (check syntaxes), then you can dumpprivkey to get all the addresses you are interested in. 
Get a new wallet and import them. Let it sync. Enjoy.

@_date: 2017-12-08 18:43:27
almost all the known wallets do that automatically by creating a brand new address and sending the change to that new address which belongs to you again.
I described the basics ao you get the concept. If you are crafting your own transactions then you need to do it youself, if you dont it will be collected by the miner as a fee. so you will lose that.

How you can even vouch for this nonsense. You do realise that UASF nodes were spun out on cloud instances and none of the major exchanges nor merchants actually switched to UASF... think next time. 30% of the nodes which included none of the major players in the ecosystem == minority chain being forked away.

How ? Segwit got activatrd because of the miners 95% ... 
@_date: 2018-05-25 09:24:55
You are missing the whole point, Segwit was activated by the miners, it is in the source code, the rules and the activation threshold, users had nothing to do with this.

* The rules are in the source code
* Majority hashpower has decided so
@_date: 2018-05-25 13:08:51
# Wrong
UASF had 30% of the nodes, not even any major exchange nodes etc... just individuals. UASF would have been the minority chain and forked into it's own chain. FACT.

Couple of things
1) Are you sure these transactions contain your address and the funds movement ? 2) In your wallet, can you check which block height you are on ? (as we speak the current block height is 458,548)

If by transaction you send coins then yes because your client can create an additional address (hence priv key), this is called "change address"
For incoming no.

Bitcoin fees are not based on the amount you send but rather how big your transaction is in terms of bytes. 
Transactions in BTC consist of Unspent (Input) which you send (Output).
When you receive a BTC you have now that amount available as Unspent. Normal TX is roughly 250 bytes (1 input 2 outputs paying to someone + return address),  shows for instance the current best fee to pay for the miners to include your transaction in the upcoming block.
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:58:38
no, addresses are not showing which wallet they belong to. also be creative when you use the return to sender address (make a new one for each transaction)
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:07:22
There are different ways of doing it. For instance you can generate bitcoin private key and then get the public address with a simple python script. It is just an algorithm. Another way of accomplishing this is the bitcoind server. You don't really need a 3rd party to generate these addresses, there is a no central place where addresses get registered or saved, it is all maths and crypto.

You don't hold any funds locally, wallet.dat is just tracking the blockchain and storing your private keys. All your funds are recorded on the blockchain.
What you should do is read about "watch only addresses" and export and save your private key somewhere safe. Don't hold any private keys on your local computer if you are not intending to transact.

Your RPC calls will be delayed if bitcoind is syncing blocks.
Bitcoin addresses can be created without bitcoind, there are plenty of ways (libs/algos) of doing it.
You will still need to "watch" / "track" the balance of the newly created addresses and make sure to at least have some level of confirmation.
Hope this helps.

Glad you came to this conclusion, UASF didn't change the consensus, again minority chain (number of nodes, exchanges, merchants, users) would have forked and that would have been luke-jr chain, end of story.


Facts are not opinions, stick to the facts and debate with facts. Your attitude is retarded, I have asked for a debate not a thrash talk.


As you say it so well, *Miners* activated SW. Finally.

@_date: 2018-03-26 13:41:58
Let's put facts on the table and debate shall we?
So, according to you UASF was responsible for activating Segwit.
1) Segwit activation was enabled by the miners this is a fact, you can check the source code yourself and see the specific rules and the algorithm which allowed to enable this.
2) All the major exchanges and merchants were not running UASF nodes but normal nodes which would have followed the main chain not the UASF one.
3) UASF nodes were not the majority of the nodes during the Segwit activation, you can see it yourself here 
4) Now, hopefully you do realise that the majority of the network would not have been in UASF chain if split was to happen, this is due to the number of UASF nodes being relatively low compared to the other nodes.
Feel free to bring solid arguments instead of just calling it bullshit.

@_date: 2018-03-26 19:29:53
Segwit was around 30% signaling without UASF. UASF didnt change the signaling that much. What did change was the NYA. You can verify this by yourself, it jumped to over 90% with NYA.
Now that I have answered, do the same and answer how a minority chain forced a main chain to make a consensus change ?

Talking is easy, put your money where your mouth is.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:05:19


1) Coinfloor's bank account is not in UK.
2) This is not a business account, you are using your corporate account and to do the same trades over and over with the same company, single entity. Try starting to accept funds or move funds to multiple (potential crypto customers) accounts and see the result.
You are also likely doing trades &lt; 5k or &lt;10k which most of the banks do not monitor.
If I am wrong, feel free to correct me.
@_date: 2018-02-04 17:48:31
Put it this way...
You are opening a business who is trading with crypto (clients buy and sell from you).
You now receive money from multiple individual or corporate clients to your business account and you need to safeguard this (segregated account), top 4 banks will probably shutdown your account within month or two...

None, your mining gear contributes close to 0% of the network hashing power, Einstein.


Everyone can spawn nodes, this is BS example. None of the Merchants, Exchanges or Businesses were running the UASF nodes, user driven nodes have f*ck all say versus the biggest flow of Money (exchanges/merchants). 
Bitmain was not scared at all, you have no idea what you are talking about.


UASF had no hashing power, triggering a chain split with a death spiral of High Difficultly for finding blocks would have been game over even before spawning the UASF network. Seriously... think twice next time you post all this.
People don't like to hear the truth but this is the sad reality, like it or not, UASF did not activate Segwit, neither helped. 
There is nothing to celebrate about a failed project launched by who is a lunatic IMO.

yes it is possible, the protocol used is called jsonrpc and is available and exposed via bitcoind.
bitcoin-cli also allows you to directly execute commands and see the responses.
More info here 
@_date: 2017-10-23 22:24:25
you must be new, still, welcome!
@_date: 2017-10-28 23:49:52
Unfortunately that would not get you large amounts of bitcoin, not even 1.
Joke a side, depends where you live and which exchange you want to use. There is also localbitcoins if you want direct transactions.
@_date: 2018-07-02 22:50:00
No, I clearly disagreed there.
@_date: 2018-04-20 17:40:35
I am waiting for your response about what a fractional reserve means. Did you read the quote ?
@_date: 2018-07-31 00:22:03
Proof of Tweet. Great achievements.
Still waiting for your uasf blocks and uasf nodes.
Yes, salty �� 
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:19:34
what are you ? 12? 
@_date: 2017-10-23 17:20:12
yeah, chip me in ;)
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:39:03
Yes, no, maybe.
@_date: 2018-04-23 20:43:29
Check the output of the transaction as a whole, not just the TXID.
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:32:29
you are really missing the point.
When you deposit 100 usd in a bank, the bank now can lend 1000. Not 30 or whatsoever. Again, they dont need to have the reserves it is in black and white written...
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:04:21
Fake, check it yourself, the volume was nowhere near the ATMs.
@_date: 2018-04-27 07:25:14
Your argument is invalid.
@_date: 2018-04-21 18:20:54
Thank you girl. When it comes to putting your money where your mouth is... it’s all cricket �� 
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:34:24
you are just embarrassing yourself.
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:40:29
We cannot, there is a limited supply of BTC, can't do fractional reserve bitcoining.
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:46:54
They cant do it with crypto, the recipient will not receive it, since the crypto doesnt exist.
When you borrow with a bank, they basically enter a negative number and you work to pay it off with interest.
I am done explaining this to you..

Yes Trinity?

Again, open the dictionary and read what a fraction means. Are you ready to put your money where your mouth is ? Let’s bet with an online escrow. When you are ready, reply, until then continue cricketing.

Facepalm ��‍♂️ 
@_date: 2018-04-20 22:57:14
username checks out.
Simple maths for you.
Total BTC is set to 100
One guy deposits 20 and want to borrow 200. Where is the crypto genius ?
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:23:07
Let me quote this for you.
Fractional-reserve banking is the practice whereby a bank accepts deposits, makes loans or investments, but is required to hold reserves equal to only a fraction of its deposit liabilities. Reserves are held as currency in the bank, or as balances in the bank's accounts at the central bank.
@_date: 2018-04-20 18:12:56
If you read the quote how comes you missed the part about

that is not 10 folds raise :)

when it's him, it is not an attack. hypocrite luke :)
@_date: 2017-05-24 19:52:41
More reason to make the statement.
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:24:49
I will repast in case you are blind.
"The bitcoin network worked great for 8 years without Segwit. Segwit doesn't solve any of the problems bitcoin users are experiencing today."
"without Segwit" means simply "no Segwit is required" and not being "skeptic" about it. 
Try harder this time around instead.
@_date: 2017-05-04 12:44:38
It is worth 22K now but might be worth 22M one day, then the chances to be targeted will be higher.
@_date: 2018-04-20 19:13:53
You are stuck in the past, thats good you will miss this train.
Bye girl.
@_date: 2018-04-21 07:18:15
It is funny you are laughing but it is sad because you are totaly wrong. Banks can lend more than they have. If you are certain about your “facts” put your money where your mouth is and let’s bet.
@_date: 2017-05-04 14:54:51
It is not 22K BTC but rather local currency...
@_date: 2017-05-25 12:01:07
I really hoped you will grasp it on your own but ok... here we go.
"The bitcoin network worked great for 8 years without Segwit. Segwit doesn't solve any of the problems bitcoin users are experiencing today."
Let me guess, your understanding is still that Roger is IN FAVOR for Segwit ? Black and white you said? Pathetic you said? Deflecting ?
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:45:18
@_date: 2017-05-24 12:42:40
The agreement stipulates Segwit to be actived FIRST. is against Segwit. There should be no issues for him to make a statement on bitcoin.com right?
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:16:22
I will repeat again, it's actually sad to see how much you struggle.
"without Segwit" means "no Segwit is required" and not being "skeptic" about it. Black and white as you wanted.
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:32:07
I am going to be nice here and try to hear out your explanation. 
What are you referring to exactly ? 
My comment is clear and concise, If wants to HF first then activate Segwit then I don't see anything which prevents him from making an official statement on bitcoin.com 
Barry's agreement (which bitcoin.com has agreed to) stupilates Segwit first followed by HF.
Please clarify your stance.
@_date: 2017-05-05 10:35:27
Read before posting. Trash comment...
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:32:35


You really need help "buddy".
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:44:31
I will leave you alone, you need some time to gather your thoughts and come back with some constructive comment.
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:08:08
... comparing penny stock(previous btc price) to btc's current price is not wise.
@_date: 2018-04-30 07:38:39
What ? It does happen.
Let’s make this a bet if you are so sure about your “facts”?
@_date: 2017-05-24 23:06:12
What? Do you understand the context?
@_date: 2017-07-20 10:06:19
and... we just have to believe you ?
@_date: 2017-07-21 14:14:50
UASF has no miner support, why would he get nervous ?

First bank to offer bitcoin using wordpress as their main website. 100% Trust. /irony
@_date: 2018-04-21 12:02:21
Thanks girl, so sure about your facts you refuse to bet? Reported.
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:38:29
Thanks but no thanks.
This is the same guy who predicted Bitcoin cash to be under $1.
This is the same guy who predicted Bitcoin to go as low as $2k
@_date: 2017-07-13 08:19:28
That mentions specifically their "blog" not their main website.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:06:32
I would love to see that. Remind me ?
@_date: 2017-07-03 11:30:43
The fees are correctly calculated, these are suggested fee for the quickest way into the next block. If you don't want that just use the median. As a side note, what's the purpose of swearing here?
@_date: 2017-07-31 11:27:12
His post raises valid concerns and arguments. This has nothing to do with BCC vs BTC ongoing camp war. Just because he supports BCC side doesn't mean you should just ignore this post.
Get a downvote.
@_date: 2017-07-28 11:06:01
It's your opinion, I will let the market decide.
@_date: 2017-07-11 16:06:27
This is pure nonsense, Ethereum is different from BTC. It's not the same attributes.
@_date: 2017-07-31 12:01:57


Again. Nowhere in his post he is taking any sides, he is exposing how people would be getting more BCC through loaning.
@_date: 2017-07-12 14:54:26

Let's see that happen. I think when it comes ti 1st of Aug you will just vanish with your newly created account.

Spoke too early, he clarified.

Segwit is an opt in feature. You can have your say but forcing people is stupid.
@_date: 2017-06-03 23:19:04
absolutely spot on. UASF is not a way to go forward.
