obviously I went to the URL. typed in my email and password just fine. there is a option to have a image password set up for extra security. I set it up months ago because hey, can't hurt. 
the image part is where I'm getting stuck

yeah I thought about the phishing potential especially since the site had a make over since I last went there. 
you select a couple of images to be your image password ( example would be - plane, fruit, shoes). it worked fine for me for months but now I can't get passed it and keep getting locked out of my account for two hours at a time.
I might of accidentally reset my image password without knowing I remember clicking on a bunch of shit unknowingly.  I'm hoping that's not the case because its impossible to guess those passwords
I emailed the site but they won't respond til tomorrow and I'm not even sure they can help. hopefully tho

the PDF of the account info? yeah I have that saved. 
I guess that's good that I may not be the only one- mostly why I posted this thread. thanks for checking if it would work for you

I guess maybe I should mentioned I checked blockchain and my coins are still in the wallet

I finally got a email back from a admin, I confirmed my identity and they took the image password off my account so I can log in now!

My thoughts exactly, I'm beating myself wishing I would of stored more since it tripled in value. I was thinking of how I spent a three hundred when I put it in and how much that could of been worth now.

I assumed, goes to show its good to wait sometime 
@_date: 2013-03-13 23:41:10
I see! I'm pretty happy

Thanks for that info, just checked blockchain they are still there! I emailed customer care so I'm going to wait and see if they can help any. It looks like I just have a encryption of my private key and the place I want to send them just allows you to deposit by entering the address of that wallet into the wallet that your coins are stored in
