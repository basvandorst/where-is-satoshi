Good question, I don't know too much about that. Waves uses their own currency to make transactions and bisq is just a tor based exchange, and fees should be similar to most other exchanges.

While I agree that op made a dumb reply because he is clearly brainwashed, I don't think a ban really makes sense for saying stupid things. I got banned on btc because I compared BCH to dogecoin, let's just not become like them, being butthurt abound anything not BTC.

I meant he will be able to use his Bitcoin to buy a house, be it a down payment or a monthly payment. Putting a down payment is buying a house even if you don't buy it outright, you are still buying a house with that down payment.

What was the fee for gifting BTC and buying with it? 
If you paid $10 for the quartz and it only took seconds to complete transaction, didn't you end up paying like $15 for just transaction fees? 
I've just been noticing that BTC has high fees for transactions if you want to get in within the first couple blocks, which supposedly take up to a minute, but if you go for more reasonable fees, then it's up to an hour or even a day for transaction to complete. 
I've never bought anything with my crypto currencies, so I'm just wondering how feasible it actually is, as the selling point for me was the fast transaction time and low fees across the world, but over time the fees have been rising.

It is a solution, because there is nothing else that has been announced to resolve this problem while keeping BTC secure and decentralized.

WTF? I'm glad I left Russia then. He has been a president for three terms already, how long can this guy last. I get it, he is the best president the country had, but god damn it, someone new would be nice. 
But yeah, since he is running again, there is no point into looking at other candidates, it's just an illusion.

Decentralized exchange
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:55:05
Wouldn't using a DEX like Bisq and Waves be a better option, since they are based on privacy and support for blockchain?

While risking is actually good, I do agree that going nuts and using the money you don't have in the large quantities isn't exactly a bright idea, especially if not pulling out in time to pay off the money you just burrowed. 
It's not to say that the BTC isn't a good currency to have, it's just that it's highly volatile and we could easily have a major crash that lasted years as the one that started back in 2013 and kept going down till 2016. 
If something like that happens again, we are going to see potentially high suicide rates, just how it happens when people burrow large sums to gamble in Casinos, just because they had some luck. 
But this is their own fault, and for all we know, if a bunch of people get into it, it just might be worth it. But when they all pull out like an investment, then the rocks will definitely fall and people will not be happy about losing value.

I'm just happy it's down in USD value, I still have the same amount of BTC as I did before, so it only means I can convert my salary into BTC for less. 
BCH is also down, so it's not like people are selling it to get more BCH.

There is a lot wrong, that doesn't even involve bcash. High fees, poor stability, huge delays and centralized focus. 
Those alone should be enough to dump it. 
Convenience is more important though to a lot of people.
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:31:07
I don't think you understood what I'm saying. 
Let me give you some more details.
Right now bitcoin isn't accepted everywhere, you can't just go and buy whatever at your local store with bitcoin. However, by the time bitcoin price reaches a much higher price point, it will probably be more adopted across the US and the rest of the world, at which point, you could simply just do a smart contract and get the house within minutes instead of going through a bunch of people, signing a ton of paper work, paying fees here and there and trying to convert to a large amount of fiat currency. 
Does that make sense? Because you are completely right, 25mph turning into 100mph instantly doesn't make sense and I'm not sure how mph can really be compared with currency in the beginning.

You are forgetring one thing, BTC is a global currency, so while yes it may be pointless if all you do is buy withing one country, buying it back with USD isn't so pointless if you are making a purchase from someone who is outside of the country. 
A lot of people forget America(US) isnt the only nation on planet Earth and not everyone speaks or wants to speak English.

For anyone interested, here is the article supporting this opinion, though not much of an article: 












































Personally, it is hard to imagine Bitcoin with a limited supply and constant hardware based mining to become a single global currency. At one point mining won't be profitable, and the amount of hardware needed to mine will push our energy consumption, plus generate a huge waste, especially in China, since they are not big on recycling.
Just my two and a half cents.

Guys, it's just money, what's the big deal if it keeps going up and down. Imagine if we invested with our bodies? At one point we would have all tricked out limbs and spare bionic parts and then boom BTC falls and all of a sudden we are left with a butt on the legs. 
All good boys.

Technically yes, via LN. You can even send a millionth fraction of a US penny if you wanted to, it's just not quite implemented everywhere yet.
