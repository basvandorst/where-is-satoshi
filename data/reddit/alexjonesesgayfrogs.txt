My reaction
@_date: 2018-01-10 01:42:32
I don't see how that's still not moving away from bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-21 12:00:21
I don't think the the price has really recovered from the drop last week. It's went up a bit but pretty slowly.

Wasn't the bitcoin stuff for the Windows Store? I'm not entirely sure what Microsoft stuff could be purchased with Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:09:28
It won't but I feel like the article yesterday about China allegedly moving away from bitcoin was a bigger deal. Microsoft was just one storefront.

If you make a payment the value at the time you made the payment should be what's reflected but idk if that would be possible.
@_date: 2018-01-10 00:47:35
Oh, that is definitely more than one storefront then
@_date: 2018-01-11 06:37:49
He does in fact haunt our dreams like a nightmarish demon, yes
@_date: 2018-01-18 02:49:33
If I was a bitcoin billionaire I'd be liquidating all my assets as USD asap when the price goes back to $16000 because this volatility is ridiculous

I know it's not underwater but this reminds me of Bioshock cause of the colors and lighting.

Can you use your phone with a headset attachment for jerry rigged VR connected to a PC? I want to do that but it seems like such a no brainer if possible but I never see anyone talk about it so I'm assuming it's not possible.

Is there an actual ETA or is it still Soon^^^TM ?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:35:46
There we go
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:25:31
I'm still not entirely sure how crypto in depth works besides the very basic concepts, but what disadvantage would there be to increasing the size of each block if it would make transactions faster? Is the issue that it would make mining much slower than it already is?
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:28:58


@_date: 2017-12-21 08:40:34
Isn't a larger block harder to mine, though?
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:16:49
I'd also like this answered.
@_date: 2017-12-23 07:19:20
If it becomes 1mill by 2020 he'll probably just clone his dick and then eat that. I think that still counts
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:47:36
I don't understand why he's such a whiny bitch whenever the other guy says "bcash"
@_date: 2018-09-19 07:47:59
Yeah, swapping out bitcoin for a card is not buying stuff with bitcoin. The transaction is done with a Visa at that point.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:52:53
Doesn't matter if it was legal or not. It was unethical and looks horrible and their customers know that these services are willing to fuck them over so they will lose a lot of business, so says the free market.
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:37:29
This isn't libertarianism. This is taking advantage of a system he created, artificially manipulating it and screwing people over.
@_date: 2017-12-21 06:41:23
Thank you

Sewing don't fuck around.

Can you elaborate on this? Like you're saying that malicious software would get taken down on a repository instantly?
@_date: 2018-03-23 10:31:37
The high fees for bitcoin basically turn it into an investment asset for most people because it's so expensive to transfer. It also doesn't help that transactions take so long to process, like less than 10 a second or something while credit card companies can do thousands a second.
I don't know if the lightning network has started changing this but hopefully so. Posts about testing it seem to be reporting good results but the network is just starting to emerge and is not widespread at the moment.

You can sell your bitcoin and hire a babysitter or nanny 
@_date: 2018-03-01 03:14:20
Ah cool ty
@_date: 2018-03-23 10:29:13
Did it pay off?
@_date: 2018-03-01 01:49:52
I asked what makes *linux* more secure than windows. Linux users being more computer savvy on average does not make the operating system itself safer.
@_date: 2018-02-18 15:37:18
Bitcoin is the terminator
@_date: 2018-03-18 04:20:14
OP idk if you did the footage or not but if you do know what is the process for feeding the design to stitch out into the machine?
@_date: 2018-02-05 08:37:11
Fuck bar ATMs also
@_date: 2018-03-15 05:23:06


OP sounds like an ad for people to buy more bitcoin tbh
@_date: 2018-02-28 19:15:00
What makes it more secure?
@_date: 2018-07-22 05:13:12
Do you get any money from transaction fees from running a node?
@_date: 2018-07-21 19:43:35
Fuck Elon Musk for being an insecure, prima dona little bitch
@_date: 2018-07-20 06:05:11
So is this a deal with Amazon or did this site like buy Amazon gift cards or something?
@_date: 2018-04-14 14:42:20
Don't treat a currency like a religion, dude
@_date: 2018-04-07 05:55:01
What are you even talking about
@_date: 2018-04-08 12:16:23
You mean make a price checking bot that send you app notifications whenever it notices a drop starting?
