"In fact the Bloomberg system is a blockchain, we just, instead of having the users control it we control it."
How can they have someone who clearly have no clue on talking about this stuff? 
It would be like the Discovery channel bringing me on to talk about Elephants (only thing I know about them is that they are huge and have a trunk). I would say something like, "in fact I am also an elephant, I just,  instead of having a trunk I have a nose."

Almost 2 000 BTC bought through Interactive Brokers (Timber Hill Europe AG) so far today. Seems to be a lot of interest coming from outside Sweden.

Very impressed by the panel. Tim Byun of Bitpay has just been dominating. Really love how he answered the money laundering question by comparing the transactions being registered on the Blockchain to the NYSE ticker.

"Starting today, these agreements let PayPal **digital goods** merchants accept Bitcoin with a simple integration through the PayPal Payments Hub. This will be available to merchants in North America first."
That is directly from the PayPal blog:

Now if you had bought Bitcoins for that $40k instead you would have ended up with more coins and all our coins would have been worth more (you buying would drive the price up a little)...

I guess some of it comes from the 2.9% fee, isn't that supposed to cover chargeback risks? But I am sure there could still be problems if Circle starts getting a lot more chargebacks than other merchants.

Unfortunately the site will not use Bitcoin, but their own alt-coin; BreakoutCoin.

Thanks a lot.

Long time since I did any math like this, so if anyone can confirm that this is correct it would be nice.
Anyways, I think you can model this as a Poisson process. If average block time is 8 minutes, we use a Poisson process with rate 1 per 8 minutes. This gives us the probability that 0 blocks have been found in 62 minutes:
e^(-7.75) = 0.00043
So you would expect 0.043% of blocks to be this slow.

How about refunding the trading fees for everyone who has used your site in the last month? If a company fails to provide the service a customer pays a fee for, that is usually what they have to do.

Donated, worked great, but as someone else said really small transactions will be a problem when having to pay the mining fee.

Only thing more shady than Mt. Gox might actually be the Bitcoin Foundation...

If I had lost $400M+ of other peoples money, the first thing I would do is provide proof of exactly where the money went. I also think we should demand that he releases all the cold storage addresses that Mt. Gox has ever used. Remember it is our money that he stored in those.
In addition it would be nice to know who sold huge amount of coins at the sub $300 prices and who was selling a lot just before the different statements were released. I really doubt we will get to know this, but hope LE looks into it as this was the most obvious inside trading I have ever seen.

This in addition to the fact that he has made no attempts to show where the "stolen" coins were sent or the addresses of any of the cold wallets Mt. Gox used, paints a picture of a very shady character.

Why do you use three different accounts to post? Seems you are writing under the users: astrofysix, greyblueshark 
 and Greatergreatshark. Is this something all great traders do and do you gain an "EDGE" from it?

I actually received the 0.01BTC this morning. if you read this, thanks a lot, you are a legend!

Not necessarily, but it says a lot about a person when he feels he has to speak with authority on something he has zero clue about instead of just saying "I don't know".

Funny how these professors never seem to factor in risk/reward in their "groundbreaking" comments:
What they always do not mention is that if BTC goes to 100k I will 10x my money, but if it goes to 100 I will only lose 1x my money, so I do not care if it is 5x as likely to go to 100.

Market cap of silver is about $450bn so his logic does not make a lot of sense...
