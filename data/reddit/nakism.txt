Withdrawals DO NOT work for US customers, even if you are just trying to withdraw COINS (BTC/ETH, etc.). 
This is the message we are getting on the Bitfinex Withdrawal tab after trying to withdraw BTC or ETH or anything for that matter:
 "Notice: At this time withdrawals are temporarily disabled for your account while we finalize your accounting and balances.
The reason for this delay is due to complications with your USD balances associated with our US banking partners. We are working in conjunction with these partners to restore full service to your account as soon as possible. Thank you for your patience"
Zane, I am out of patience and so are many others.
u/zanetackett has not disclosed precisely why, although, he has already been addressed by another user in this regard. 
I can tell you exactly why withdrawal is disabled. I contacted the Bank (Bitfinex's "Partner" Synapse Pay). Synapse Pay has revoked 100%/All of Bitfinex's USD account authentication. Basically, Synapse Pay (the bank) has disabled Bitfinex from touching all USD accounts. If you had USD in your account and it was typically routed through Synapse Pay (bank), then you can contact Synapse Pay directly to get 100% of your money back. Do not work with Bitfinex if this is the case for you... and consider yourself extremely lucky. :) 
u/zanetacket, when will US customers be able to withdraw COINS such as BTC/ETH, etc?

that is impossible, because the pre-filled the orderbook with their own orders to buy and sell BFX. I have screens shots 1 hour before the exchange came online. It was all visible through the API. Most of their buy orders (very large orders) were for prices from $0.01 to $0.13.
Hope this helps.

I added a link to the screen shots.
