This is in fact why i like mooncoin, is mineable, fast transactions, wallet for each OS, and 384 bilions mineable, and now is rising 400% since month ago. 
96º on coinmarketcap and RISING
check 180 days chart
And you could have 6 million of mooncoins just for 1 Litecoin which is 3 eur or almost 4dollars.
Is better to have 6.000.000 mooncoins than 0.01BTC

The cryptocurrencys and their amazing blockchains has arrived to give the people Economic freedom, We don't need more intermediaries between us and the currency. The time of banksters-gangsters is ending.
