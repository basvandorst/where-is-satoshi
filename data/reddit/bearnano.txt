Sorry about responding late to the party , I was still in class. 
The accounting professor is a retired  CPA auditor for the state of Kentucky. He loved the idea about frictionless transactions. He brought it up because we were going over bank fees. 
He said something along the lines of I can't wait to see what the future has in store for finance. We can only wait and see. 
Edit: grammar

Thank you for your reply, bitcoin is a great community. With its own  inside jokes.

I just had to say/type this before I would regret not doing so. The name Laszlo to me sounds like a name I would hear in history books. I have a feeling of nostalgia when I hear his name, as if I had heard it before. His name will be remembered and encased within the history of Bitcoin.
All I am saying is that I get this eery feeling when people bring him up, because truly that was the tipping point.
His name makes it feel like we are talking about history (and we are). It's like saying benjamin franklin, alexander bell or something of the like. 
Well that was a nice rant I had.
Hopefully others can see what I am trying to convey here.

He came off more of a sideliner/optimist. Nonetheless still impressive for a retired state auditor. Glad to see the older generation taking notice.

I've got it all set, I'm using Google docs. Pm me of you you'd like a format of the spreadsheet. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:21:33
Anyone have a formatted excel file?  
@_date: 2014-11-12 18:36:01
Could you explain what happened in that thread exactly?

This is an old screenshot from 3 years ago. Just looking back at the past and seeing how Tesla was almost going to surpass Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-10-11 02:40:14
No worries lol. Just looking back at how low BTC was. Should have bought more!
@_date: 2018-10-11 21:38:32
They lost lol

Thank you!

I've felt the same way. I did have a little moment of terror once I didn't recognize the format. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 14:09:56
This is why I love reddit! 
@_date: 2013-12-17 05:32:30
Read the first comment below the article OP linked. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:46:34
How are you using spreadsheets to keep track of your bitcoin finances? I apologize I am inexperienced, perhaps a tutorial or walk-through for those new?
@_date: 2013-12-11 00:42:18
I was contemplating myself, this just helped. I've done my share of research and am pretty well caught up in all bitcoin related news. Just think about this for a second. We have had to convert into mBTC. Its becoming the norm for bitcoins to surpass the 1000's. This is my pure reasoning and may not make any logical sense to you. I have a vision and I don't believe its to far fetched.
