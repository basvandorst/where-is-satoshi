State level compliance is tricky for determining when you need to become regulated.  Tell me, where do you see Cryptsy, Coinbase, Bittrex, etc. etc. etc. registered in any of those states' MSB lists?  (I suppose that question is really calling out the article author, not you OP)
AFAIK, very few crypto MSB's, if any, are registered at the state level.

Standard practice is to basically send a letter to the states saying "here's why we don't think we're considered an MSB by your state law.  Please contact us if you feel otherwise".  
Either way, my guess is that this article is more out to spread FUD re: PayBase than write a comprehensively accurate article.  (note: I know nothing about PayBase so am not saying anything about their trustworthiness or lack thereof)

That shows 'activities', not registrations.  All that shows is that they're active in every state.  However, if you look at the state level, you won't see them listed.  For example, here's the full list of companies registered as money transmitters in North Carolina:

I was under the impression that the price of GBTC would fluctuate 1:1 with the Bitcoin price.  That's why I was thinking it didn't make much sense for GBTC to fluctuate 25% without Bitcoin doing the same.
Perhaps I misunderstood your second comment.  I'm not sure what you meant.

Bitcoin didn't go from $400 to $300.  And can you pay for dinner with a share of AAPL?

Agreed.  Calling bullshit on a 0-day account that has to find a solution *fast* for $10+ million in Bitcoin.

If you're avoiding fiat conversions, you may be able to figure out something that works without MSB licensing, but definitely talk with a compliance attorney to find out if it's possible and what the various thresholds would have to be.  
I'd think that accepting Bitcoin for sale of in-game goods will be no problem.  However, if you also allow for the opposite (transmitting BTC for the goods), it'll be more of a gray area.

I'm really struggling to finish.  Kept checking back here to see if anyone had commented yet.  These questions are just painful.
"To me, financial benefits are [good or bad]".  Wut.

One interesting concern is that they are a federally registered MSB but as far as I can tell they aren't requiring any kind of ID verification, even for orders over $3k/$10k (I could get to the "make reservation" page anyways, with no mention of ID verification).
Wondering if they're holding MSB compliance.

Are you talking about all the SR bitcoins?  Speculation was that they sold for at/above market value.

That's not accurate - they transmit digital currency to the purchaser and have the responsibility of verification.  Your statement is like saying "if they accept payment via Skrill or Western Union, it's Skrill/WU's responsibility" - and.. in fact, would apply to basically every form of payment receipt.
You're considered a money transmitter if you transmit digital currency.  There's no question about it, and there are specific AML/KYC regulations that MSB's (money transmitters) must follow - there's no trickle-down compliance of relying on payment processors.

What exactly are we looking at on that chart?
