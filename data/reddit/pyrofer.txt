You are entitled to what is shows as your balance in your account.
I had just over 2.5 BTC and am "entitled" to nothing more and nothing less than my balance.
They will NOT do any BTC to $ conversion as that is just stupid and asking for a buttload of hurt.

I hope you at least stayed a short while and had a nice holiday.
Would be a shame to go to Tokyo and not enjoy it! There is so much to see and do that is not BTC related.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:56:08
I would love to see how this is enforced.
So many people will just lie. 
"No, I mined these 10k BTC when the price was 1c per btc"
Maybe they will be more honest going forward, but I doubt it.

There was me worried that all my money had been stolen when I should have been worrying about if some stranger I have never met is still in Japan!! How heartless I am.
I only put my BTC into MtGox to withdraw it as cash because I needed it, they lied to me and failed to validate my account for 3 months preventing me getting it out, guess what? By the time I got validated it was too late and I lost everything.
I cannot write quite how I feel about this man.
Donations accepted at,
I know we are all in the same boat but it can't hurt :(

This really annoys me the most. Where were all these warnings when I was asking where to exchange my bitcoin?
Everything I saw, read, heard said MtGox was the largest, longest running and most trusted exchange.
If you really knew there was trouble you didn't do anything that I saw.
I wasn't aware of r/bitcoin till 2 or more weeks AFTER I lost everything.
My google searches on MtGox showed a few people moaning about late payments but NOT ONCE did somebody say "It's run by a frenchman, written in PHP and they already got hacked in 2011". If I had seen THAT sentence I would have stayed the hell away.
edit:Not getting at tharlam here, mcgravier but I wanted to include tharlams sensible post.
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:36:15
I was about to say "HOW MUCH!" and be all outraged.
But if I had been able to sign up for them instead of MtGox I would be doing a lot better than I am now even with those fees :p
@_date: 2014-03-10 20:02:27
Sorry to hear that you feel donating is "losing value", you are boosting the world economy so one day, it will help you. Thanks for being one of the good guys and actually donating too.
While I would love the bitcoin rich to swoop in and save us "victims" of Gox there is no real reason for them to do so, and no real benefit. Short term BTC suffers but this massive dent will help shore it up better in the future making a more stable system in the long term, which is what we all want. Stability.
Not many people will be spending BTC while they are scared of a "2 large pizzas" situation.

This was pretty much what the "crisis" document suggested.
Just answer this, why don't you give up all your money to help starving children in the third world?
There is always somebody worse off than you.
@_date: 2014-03-21 09:53:15
It doesn't explain how everybody knew that they had the 200k except them!!
All Mark had to do was read Reddit and see the posts of "what about this 200k wallet from 2011 that MtGox own?" to "find" them.
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:01:57
I am not even sure I have an IOU, that would probably be worth more...
@_date: 2014-03-25 11:09:05
If you lost any money/BTC in Gox I wouldn't say it was totally free...
@_date: 2014-03-03 13:38:33
Why is everybody having a go at people saying this???
For those of us who have money INSIDE MtGox we have 2 choices,
1) Save it and have a tiny chance to get something back
2) Let it die and get nothing.
Now I don't know about you, but a tiny chance is better than nothing. I for one would be willing to let the money I have lost inside it be turned into financing for the "new" exchange. Maybe it will die or maybe it will rise from the ashes, but if they don't try my money is already gone.
This makes it a no (more) lose option for me, So why not?
@_date: 2014-03-21 09:46:37
As somebody who DID have BTC in gox, this shit is still hilariously entertaining.
I may have lost my BTC but you can't argue that this isn't the worst run company in the world. You gotta larf.
@_date: 2014-03-21 10:04:08
As far as I am aware the MtGox coin is being treated as customer property in this. Ie, it will be and can only be returned to the BTC balance owning customers.
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:58:37
I will assume this is a genuine question and not a troll,
2.5 BTC is at the moment about $1200 - $1400 as the rate varies.

The guy fights for 16 years to improve consumer protection, wins and gets screwed even though he won? How is that NOT a good cause?
@_date: 2014-03-21 09:50:42
Yes, I agree. All depends on if they are able to simply write off the 100k of their own BTC when working out what to pay back or not.
@_date: 2014-03-11 08:13:40
well if you want an honest and proven way you can check the leaked Database!
I looked up my balance and my 2.5btc was shown correctly alongside about £0.40 cash.
If people can prove their ID (which most can if they kept emails from MtGox) then you can look up their balance.
The problem is there are not enough nice people like you to cover even all the people like me that lost 2.5btc let alone the ones that lost tens, hundreds or thousands of BTC.
I can't afford to buy anymore BTC so my miner is running making me about £0.30 a day. It doesn't make me feel much better about my loss :(
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:09:00
doesn't the bitcoinpaperwallet code have a "verify" tab that lets you paste the private key in and get the output to show it's valid?
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:55:36
If that is your attitude I have a load of MtGox BTC I can sell you cheap :)
@_date: 2014-03-11 07:57:13
First one I looked up had 2.4btc balance....
@_date: 2014-03-21 09:51:53
You lucky bar steward.
@_date: 2014-03-08 00:06:36
At this point a 20% return on my coins is about 20% more than I expected, or still expect.
Wait to be pleasantly surprised, but seriously? The coins are not coming home.
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:37:50
They are stored safely in the vault of a Nigerian Prince. 
If you transfer 10BTC to me I can pay you 1000BTC next month when they release the funds.
@_date: 2014-03-26 15:27:39
Maybe, despite how stupid he obviously is, he was just wise enough to learn to keep his mouth shut by this point?
There does come a point where you are so deep in the shit even the dumbest man learns to keep his mouth shut...

They could make up a fake passport using your details and then blow up a plane using them (well, not using the passport to blow the plane up but to get ON a plane that they then blow up, you know what I mean). I would say that is pretty much about as bad as it can get.
Financially, they can create bank accounts, credit cards, buy cars, maybe a house in your name and leave you with all the debt.
Time to curl up in a ball and cry.
Along with the rest of us. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:29:59
As a fellow "2.5" loser I can agree, to us it feels big.
It was more than I wanted to lose, I only had it in MtGox in order to cash it out but they spent months "approving" my account and then stopped withdrawal just before they did so I never had a chance.
It's funny, at this point none of the digits AFTER my 2.5 seem to matter, those first few are enough :( When I HAD them, every last digit mattered.

Many people GO ON HOLIDAY to the USA. As a UK citizen I have indeed shopped at Target within the last year.
@_date: 2014-03-26 15:29:04
if I get any Gox coin back I will certainly put it straight into a paper wallet and place it in a safe. Learnt my lesson.
@_date: 2014-03-11 08:19:11
Could be proceeds of botnets getting paid in for that last one.
My guess for the others is attempts at triggering the bug to get free BTC.
I would expect these accounts to be the ones in the 80k "suspect" list.
@_date: 2014-03-21 11:50:05
The balance was driven by their own internal database. The Actual BTC were not stored in a wallet just for your account but poured into a giant pit of a central wallet that was then ****** to ******.
So your BTC balance shows how much you are allowed to withdraw from the central funds not the balance of an actual wallet.
@_date: 2014-03-18 12:00:35
Well considering our proof of identity has ALSO been leaked this could be an interesting challenge...
"All claims must be made in person in Tokyo..."
@_date: 2014-03-10 19:55:47
I hope you saved some people then.
Obviously I missed the warning and had people telling me I SHOULD use MtGox because it was the biggest and "safest".
Who do I blame? Myself and Mark. Mostly myself.
Thanks for trying to warn people.
@_date: 2014-03-21 09:49:28
They should forget their own 100k BTC first, leaving only 550k missing out of the 850k, so that is quite a good chance of return for customers.
after seizing the 80k suspect accounts too there should be at least some return for their victims.
It's looking up for the first time since the website went offline.
@_date: 2014-03-21 09:58:58
Hah, don't. I did that once and got down-voted to hell.
@_date: 2014-03-21 09:54:30
BTC != fiat.
If they do ANY conversion from BTC to fiat then they are stealing from the BTC holding customers. The BTC belongs to the account holders NOT MtGox so they have no right to use it to pay off fiat debts.
@_date: 2014-03-26 15:31:09
as far as I know he just had to show it was possible to save the company so they could pay back customers by whatever means, he didn't have to show he could get those coins back specifically.
If all he had to do was convince a judge it was "possible" even if not realistic, then I can see why he would do that.
@_date: 2014-03-27 13:57:19
There are many ways to commit fraud and you may even get away with it.
You could also just lie and say you don't have any. The rules are only there for those who choose to follow them.
I have no idea how this will be enforced.
@_date: 2014-03-10 09:34:31
Yeah, you have to send your btc to me and I will pay them in for you in the meantime...
@_date: 2014-03-28 13:58:42
I do agree with the "long term" thing.
I could have sold out when it hit $1k but I didn't instead I chose to hold on and lose them all to MtGox, wait, what?
Ok New idea, hide under your bed and hope nobody gets you.
@_date: 2014-03-21 09:45:25
The BTC belong to the customers NOT mtgox, and as such you can't just sell them to cover other debts.
If your TV was in for repair when the shop went bust it remains YOUR tv. They have to attempt to return them to the owners of the accounts first.
There is no way they could sell them to cover fiat loss, that would be stealing from the people with a BTC balance.
@_date: 2014-03-21 10:07:54
But as BTC isn't "money" it's customer property, they can't liquidate customer property?
If in your example the "company lambo" was "owned" by 2 people who bought a lambo they obviously couldn't give it to both of them, either they sell it and split the money to return to customers or pick one (first to buy?) to get the whole car.
We need to know the exact legal definitions of this case in Japan before we get any clue :(
@_date: 2014-03-10 10:03:38
Luckily I use random passwords for all sites, so this doesn't make things much worse and was totally expected.
I am more worried about my ID documents as mentioned.
It's ok, I am simply changing my bank account number, address, face, complete identity. I hear there are some for sale at the moment :)
@_date: 2014-03-28 15:01:00
Fair enough. I got the link from here and guess I was just lazy by not looking up the correct path to report some such.
Also, as I got the link from here others may do the same before the info is removed so I hope they see this and avoid bit121.
@_date: 2014-03-08 10:15:13
I have seen MANY posts with people losing 2.5... Is this some sort of magic number? It's what I lost too.
