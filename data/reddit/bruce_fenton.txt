"Bitcoin computer is not what investors hoped for" 
Of course - that's not what the plan is.  People who think the endgame for 21 is to try to sell those particular devices should look into it more.
My guess is that, as Microsoft once envisioned a world with "A computer on every desk and in every home, running Microsoft software",  21 perhaps envisions a world where almost every device has computer chip (cars, ovens, parking meters, drones, laptops, kindles and the biggie...phones!) and that chip is a mini 21 computer...that is mining Bitcoin and, more importantly, enabling the device to make money, pay for stuff and transfer payments.   
This uses the power of Bitcoin to change the paradigm for how we pay for things and opens new doors to things it was not practical to pay for (the "writers can make 3 cents every time someone reads an article" concept we were talking about 20 years ago).  
It's really an insanely exciting and huge idea if you think about it.
21 is working at a much higher level and the Bitcoin computers were SDKs for developers to help see what kind of IOT / Bitcoin apps could be made -- it's essentially R&amp;D -- only instead of hiring and managing all those devs and judging what might work...they released the computer for the world to organically build stuff.  
As an added bonus they sold the R&amp;D computers for money - pretty smart.
I'm sure the original business plan didn't say "please give us $100mm to sell computers on Amazon".  :)
They have a great team, IMHO one of the very best in this industry.  
Just as people once speculated Circle might be vaporware while they were quietly building one of the best UIs in Bitcoin, 21 - if you look at the job openings they've had etc - is definitely doing good stuff.   
They know what they are doing.  Keep watching.

Well they can't really control it - they can't push something through without dev and miner and user consensus.
Even on things like LN which everyone pretty much agrees with and Blockstream supports - they don't have a switch they can throw to implement.

1) Does a for profit company pay some of the most influential devs?  Yep.
2) Is this a conflict of interest?  No.  For it to be a conflict one would have to show that what they are doing in dev is counter to what is right for Bitcoin so that it benefits Blockstream.
3) Can the devs paid by Blockstream push something through that the miners and users and rest of the devs disagree with?  No.
4) Is there evidence they are acting in a bad way against Bitcoin?  No.
5) Do they have a long record of respecting privacy, the independence of the protocol and its fundamental principles?  Yes.  
Read the posts by Adam Back, Greg Maxwell &amp; others going back years before Bitcoin even existed. These are the kinds of voices we need more of.  Take a look at how Blockstream has dealt with rhe pro-regulation industry movements and how, while many were fawning over CA AB1326, they were writing to condemn it. 
What particular code / protocol development do you take issue with?
What would make someone assume that because someone is paid by a for profit corporation that they are doing something negative to the code?  
Is this true any more than if they were independent, working for their own company or funded by a non profit or donations?
When Bitcoin Foundation funded dev, people thought this was too centralized.  This was a non profit.  Today MIT also funds development, this is a non profit.  Neither are inherently better or worse because of being non profit.
It's a very good idea to carefully look at what devs and other influencers are doing, who they are and their motivations.
But it's much more important to look at what they do, what they support and their own words, actions and philosophy.
There is nothing at all either bad OR good about a dev being funded by a "for profit" or "non profit" whether VC backed or sponsored or otherwise.  Judge on what they do.
It's great that Blockstream makes development a priority and really surprising that more companies don't do the same.
The other day I tweeted that companies with $10 mm+ in funding should all hire a C++ dev with the job description of learning Bitcoin core and contributing when capable.

Nope, easily verifiable &amp; not disputed:
CoinCenter supported first failed bill, "helped craft" (their words) that version, NEVER once asked for second one to be dropped (asked for changes) &amp; says they will now "happily" work with author to try to "get it right" and attempt to pass these regs a third time.
EFF, me, Colin Gallagher, Blockstream and others opposed first bill, opposed second bill asked for both bills to be dropped both times on grounds that we believe it's too early to regulate this tech and that the bills had several major problems.
Both times what we asked of legislators occured and both times what CoinCenter asked for was rejected.  (people can judge what approach they think was more likely to cause the drop)
This is not opinion, anyone can look the facts up.  
People should be informed and decide for themselves what approach they prefer or think is more effective - board members of industry groups should also share the opinion they believe represents their membership, not just the ones you agree with.

Can't you raise the discourse a bit from playing the "Arab" card again?
I associate with gays, Jewish and black people also, after all - using an ethnic, religious or racial group as a derogatory adjective is counterproductive - but who knows, given your affinity for statism, maybe the Trump / wall building style appeals to you.
Yes, I do advisory work in the Gulf:  I go into some of the most restrictive and regulated economies in the world and encourage business-friendly, non-regulatory, free-market solutions such as economic free zones and public private partnerships that don't cost a dime of taxpayer money.   You on the other hand, go in to one of the least restrictive and most free economies in the world and encourage more anti-business, regulatory interference which harms innovation and is paid for by the taxpayers.  See the difference?
I bent over backwards to count you as "friends" as you suggest and asked politely and privately numerous times for you to discuss your strategy.  I had an open mind, especially considering that so many people I respect support CoinCenter.  Unfortunately you've given no argument at all and no indication you are anything other than destructive.  
Why not prove me wrong?  Show us the letter where you asked for this reg to be dropped.  You are taking credit for it being dropped after all - if this was true there should be a letter. 
Show the proof and I'll apologize, donate money to you and never criticize this issue again.  Until then (or any evidence at all to the contrary) you'll have to forgive me if I consider your group to be both a fraud and harmful based on your own words, blog posts, letters and actions.
I wish that wasn't the case.  It does none of us any good, lease of all me, to burn bridges and argue.  But I care more about this tech than that and there doesn't seem to be an alternative.

No, complaining to reps actually is noticed and a completely effective means of changing policy.   
Are you from the US?  Have you heard of organizations like the AARP, the NRA and others who affect policy with advocacy that includes call campaigns to reps?   It's done all the time and is actually one of the more effective means of making change occur.
What exactly is your alternative plan?   To continue to reward people like him the way Lawksy was rewarded with public praise, media coverage and speaking engagements?
And no, he's not "in a position" to do anything.  He's a third rate California assemblyman who already wrote one crap law that was shelved and is now attempting it again.

Phone number is right on the page.
I'm not encouraging harassment, I'm encouraging the same type of activism used by thousands of people daily. 
I get it, you love regulation and think that it's a great idea to engage with these fools.  I don't.  I warned of exactly this a year ago regarding the same legislation, so far I've been exactly correct.
Yes, you are ignorant and am amatuer, sorry, it's clear in your posts you have no understanding of activism or how to effect change when dealing with lawmakers.   
You are again going off topic discussing the foundation and comparing it to politics and bureaucracy.  My term was not a failure either, happy about the work I did while there.

Huh?   The phone number is right on the link I provided.
Melting a phone is an expression used to describe "making several calls" I thought that would be clear.  
Or perhaps you just don't think calls are a good form of engagement.  Or maybe it's only bad if there are lots of calls?   
In any event, you should really reach out to the hundreds of activists and advocacy groups who encourage people to call reps to let them know that your expertise says that everyone is wrong but you.
Re: foundation.  I see you are desperately trying to make an ad hominem attack by bringing this up.  Do you really not see the difference between being a part time unpaid volunteer at a non profit and seeking to stop this crap bill the first time it came around and being a paid elected politician who is making a second attempt to push a bad bill?

Nah, I don't get the point of the video.  
Your humor must be as elusive as the concept of "let's ask for more regulation to get less regulated".
I'd be a lot more impressed if you could produce a letter from CoinCenter asking Dababneh to drop (not change) the bill.   But you can't produce that can you?
In fact can you produce any letter you've ever written to any lawmaker asking to not regulate?

This is where I have trouble believing you are genuine and not simply mistaken or naive.  
The letter is 7 pages which requests a number of changes.  Clearly if they had integrated those changes you would have declared victory and supported it as you did last time.  
This is where we have a fundamental difference of opinion that for some reason you have trouble publicly admitting:  you want new regs, wanted the last bill to pass and, presumably, would have wanted this bill to pass also if your changes had been integrated.

It's not really possible unless you really know a good handful of early adopters / large holders.
If you could get 10 people to sell you 100,000 coins each quietly it's possible.
Not that many people hold 100,000 coins and those who do are usually private -- they are also almost always people who intend to hold those a long time and might not be included to sell unless at a very high premium.
I know a decent number of people in Bitcoin who are large holders and have asked around about this among my contacts and estimate that 100,000 coins could be done with a bit of time (a few weeks perhaps) and a premium being paid.

Gallagher isn't with CoinCenter who helped craft the original bad bill - he was one of the many who opposed the new AND original versions. 
Did the calls and letters to lawmakers asking to not support the bill cause the defeat?   Who knows.  But we do know for sure that proactively asking for more regs is a failed strategy.

Actions speak louder than your sales &amp; marketing:
**Please show us a letter where you unequivocally asked Dababneh to drop (not add new laws or changes to he latest version) the bill and I'll publicly apologize.**
As far as claiming I don't understand the two versions--  you know that this isn't true or the point -- every one of the many posts I've made on this has been clear that you 
1) first supported one bad bill 
2) then were against the new (worse) version of the same bill 
Everyone is well aware it was two different versions (IMHO both bad) - one you supported, one you didn't. 
Nothing at all "dishonest" about pointing out your own record in support of the original bad bill. 
You say "it was as good a bill as we could get" - actually no, that's the narrative you pushed at the time, you claimed that we needed the first bad version because we couldn't get better  -- in reality the best you could have gotten is what the EFF and I and others asked for:  NO new bill.  Despite your claims, clearly no bill was possible -- because we got exactly this. 
You are not only not accepting the possibility your tactics could be wrong but completely missing the point:  **the worse version of the bill would have been far less likely if not for your helping to craft and push forward the first version.**
Fortunately your efforts to have t passed failed or we would have had the first bad bill passed nearly a year ago. 
Because Sen Holly Mitchell and others did not heed your advice, CA Bitcoin businesses made it another year without the new law you wanted (the first version). 
You say you worked to "kill" the new one?  Your posts indicated that you wanted to change the wording back to the old failed version. Your tweet said you didn't support it "in its current form".  What form did you support?
Do you have any copies of your letters to CA legislators in outright opposition of this?  
**In fact, do you have copies of ANY letters you've EVER written asking for any lawmakers to drop regulation entirely?**
You keep making claims that you are not in favor of more regulation  but your actions show otherwise.

I wasn't changing the ask - said this to you an hour earlier:
"I'd be a lot more impressed if you could produce a letter from CoinCenter asking Dababneh to drop (not change) the bill."
Asking for different regs is very different from asking them to drop regs.  
I wish we had the same end goal but sadly we don't seem to - your goal seems to be the "regulatory roadmap" and more bad bills like the first AB1326 or what this version would have looked like with your changes. 
It's not a matter of ego - this is why I tried to speak on these topics privately many times.  
 I am perfectly willing to admit he possibility that I'm a fool and completely wrong on this -- I'd love to be convinced of that.   In your own ego / arrogance you cannot seem to accept even the slightest possibility that real world actions on regs are different than academic theory and that your tactics are dead wrong.

It was a great event and probably one of the things I'm happiest about during my time as Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation -- it's great that we were able to convene a diverse group who doesn't often get together.
We also had Jeff Garzik, Charlie Lee and others.  The audience was 85% or so devs, aspiring devs and students.  Tickets were very affordable at $70 or so including lunch and there were no paid sponsors.

Zero experience?
I have 20 years being a registered supervisor and being regulated by half a dozen major financial regulators -including FINRA, SEC, FSA etc passed Series 24, 7 the Uniform Investment Advisor Law Exam etc in this process getting dozens of audits and meeting 100+ regulators all the way to cabinet level / director positions.  
Afaik Jerry has never been regulated in his life and never had to comply with the types of regulations he pushes.  He's never made an application for a financial license, never been audited by a financial regulator, never had to comply with the regs to do business.  His "vast experience" consists of reading about regulations in books, fundraising and writing letters to regulators supporting more bad regs.  
I know you'll value his academic theory as more valuable than real life experience with regulators:   That's fine,  proof is in the results - Jerry pushed for a bad bill and we now have a worse one to show for it.  I don't care how much expertise Jerry appears to have on paper or how well he presents- any more than I care how Bernie Sanders looks on paper:    his results have been amateurish and an utter failure.

I'm not an expert on thier business - pure speculation.
But remember that expensive chips are already in these devices.  21 has the connections and weight to potentially change the type of chip already used to also do mining.   (So, you can choose between Samsung Galaxy 7 or Samsung Galaxy 7 Miner - just like you can choose, a locked, dual sim or EU sim version now.).    
This is total speculation and Samsung is only a sample company that I picked because I actually don't think that specific example is likely.
As for electricity cost -- the electricity is already used and would be minimal -- when you play Magic the Gathering on iPad it will drain your entire battery in 60 minutes instead of 8 hours - but the actual cost of that extra charge on your nightstand is insignificant to almost all people and this mining will not be something people do for an ROI based on electrify cost like commercial mining.  Primary purpose (again, speculating) would be to make devices smarter and certain kinds of payments and transactions easier.

20 years complying with investment regulations makes me careful about what I say.   I just want to emphasize that this is my best guess based on the material they have written and publicly released.
It's smart to have some R&amp;D done by the crowd for free (they are actually paying you a small amount) - gives the ability for 21 to throw 1000 projects at the wall and see what sticks and for new verticals they never thought of (or would have pursued) to be explored.  
A killer app might be something that helps corn farmers, oil delivery trucks in Canada, a Tinder competitor or Tawianese accountants -- who knows - when iPhone SDK came out absolutely no one conceived of Uber, GoPro camera control or Throne Rush being linked to your Facebook account and people paying for pixels of fake magic wizards.
IOT, specifically, IOT of Bitcoin / transactions if/ when it works will create new stuff no one has yet imagined.  By offering an SDK, Balaji and his team don't need to listen to pitches or make judgements or pay anything. They can focus on other business aspects and see what develops and works organically.

To be clear:  it was without question the pro-business  activists and groups like EFF that caused this bill to be stopped....not the pro-regulation groups who, asked for it originally and now seek to claim victory for their failure in getting the bill changed back to the first bad version they helped craft.
@_date: 2016-08-13 00:28:54
While those who proactively asked for the first bad bill to be supported by the CA Senate were working to get their old language from the other version of the bad bill reactivated --  activists like Colon Gallagher were contacting legislators and asking for the entire bill to be scrapped (again).   
We also initiated a phone call campaign to the office of the bill's sponsor Matt Dababneh, who ultimately decided the bill was not worth pursuing. 
Engaging with lawmakers and regulators is a great idea- provided that engagement is focused on explaining technical alternatives to regs and the business benefits of a more hands off approach - rather than praising bad regs and encouraging roadmaps to more new bad regs.  
When lawmakers pursue bad regulation the first effort should be to respectfully educate them and explain alternatives.  If this fails then we should work to increase public support of dropping the regs and if that fails then we should support the opponents of that lawmaker.  
Despite what self appointed experts on regulation may say, it is NOT inevitable and it CAN be successfully fought.  
We don't need to rush through bad regs for fear of worse ones - that strategy didn't work for the Internet and it's never worked anywhere else.  Lawmakers will work in their own self interest and WILL respond to public inquiries.

Great work to the activists who fought this bad bill from the start.  
Hopefully we can all learn a few lessons:
1) regulation is NOT inevitable
2) attempting engagement and education first is great - if this fails then efforts at changing public opinion and contacting lawmakers are not wasted
3) next time instead of proactively supporting bad regs out of paralyzed fear of even more regs -- lets instead follow the successful examples of activists in Canada, Masschusetts and other places and show lawmakers that not passing new regs is not only wise, it's pro jobs and pro business

There isn't much difficulty in judging the effectiveness of this particular non-profit. 
1) After reading the original AB1326 they supported - does it seem like a good bill?
2) In retrospect; now that we see the new, even worse, version of AB1326 - does it still seem that engaging with Dababneh and giving him press and legitimacy was a good idea?
If the answer is yes then Coincenter is an org you should support.

When Mass was about to release a version of the Bitlicence I met the head banking regulator and his team (as I've met hundreds of govt officials in the past) and explained how it was too early, damaging and could cause business to leave and have other drawbacks. 
 I explained the technical alternatives to regs such as proof of reserves and illustrated some of the drawbacks of NY's Bitlicence.  
This is the technique that worked in Dubai, it works in Canada and can work in the US. 
Would Coincenter have gone in with the same technique?  No, the website clearly shows the technique they advocate- they would have gone in with the "roadmap" and told Mass how the regs should be written, they would have spent hundreds of hours "helping craft" the regs and we would have gotten a crap bill that they'd now be shocked has drawbacks.  
I'll doubt I'll ever agree that the path to a business friendly environment is to proactively ask for new laws.  
Your consistent claims that not actively seeking new regs is extreme or "wing nut" or the implication that I'm advocating some sort of anarchist style tactic isn't accurate.

Are people under the illusion that fiat money is actually in banks and not simply imaginary electric entries?
If the Internet crashed people would only have as much fiat cash as they have in their pocket and home.  
There would be a run on banks and ATMs which would both be closed and even if open, people would only be able to take a very small portion of what they think they have.

It's a simple phone campaign - nothing more.  The term "melt" doesn't have any major meaning -- I was basically encouraging people to call.  (And no, I wasn't encouraging people to call multiple times, just for lots of people to call.). I also know that he won't answer his own phone.  
Elected officials deal with this all the time.  Members of Congress for example have staff who have a whole procedure to field such calls, it's common for them to receive hundreds in a day on any given issue.
I've seen this work and even done so myself.  For example, in my state, Mass there was a politician who called for home searches of firearms.  I called for a phone campaign (probably used almost the same wording) and hundreds of people called his office over the weekend.  He got so exasperated that he called me at home and said "How do I make this go away?" I asked for him to retract his statement and apologize and he did so immediately.
There are only a couple ways to get politicians to do the right thing:  1) educate them, appeal to their career, goals etc. sweet talk them, help them fundraise, get them positive publicity.
2) make it a painful process for them, make them look bad in the press, cause them to be distracted and need to focus on reacting to the press or contact you generate and make it not worthwhile 
It's always better to do option 1 -- but when it's someone like Dababneh or Lawsky then they are enemies who are not worth engaging with.  If it must be option 2 then you engage in tough politics the same as the politicians do: a phone campaign is mild compared to protestors, following people with cameras or a bunch of other tactics.   The goal with option 2 is for the politician and his internal staff to want the issue to go away.   Don't underestimate how even 3-4 dedicated people can cause change... even if they are hated by the politician

It's a matter of philosophy. 
The position of those of us who oppose this is that we should engage with regulators and lawmakers by asking them to reduce regs and refrain from passing new ones.  
Coincenter's theory is that backing bad regs like the earlier version of AB1326 will help industry.

It's one thing to disagree on a technical matter but it's a big stretch to question the motives of someone like this.
Roger is an ally to Bitcoin and has show a lot of dedication and passion for Bitcoin for longer than most people.
Can you point to anyone else who has made as many public appearances, videos etc as early as he has and at his own expense?  How many people first got passionate about Bitcoin because of Roger?  Who else was willing to make a $10,000 bet that Bitcoin would outperform gold and the stock market when Bitcoin was at $11 and everyone else thought Bitcoin was absolutely crazy?  Who else was willing to risk so much so early when things were so much more uncertain than today?  Who else was willing to invest in startups like Krakken and Blockchain 2+ full years before any more established VCs even attended a conference?  Who else is so easily willing to appear on interviews etc?
If there was no Roger, like it or not, Bitcoin would be a different place.  Many people who saw him speak wouldn't have heard about it, several startups would have had less funding, someone else would own Bitcoin.com etc.  His impact has been real and even those who really disagree on block size should agree that it's been overall positive.
(And by the way, this goes for Gavin also, assuming his critics are right and Gavin is both technically wrong and was wrong in how he handled things socially and he didn't make any contributions for a long time....he still made a heck of a lot of early commits, took a lot of risk early on and sacrificed money for what he felt was good work on the protocol many times.)
I'm sad that there is disagreement about a technical issue - it's unfortunate that the rhetoric about capacity and block size is taken personally and becomes acrimonious at times.  
People have made mistakes.
But this isn't at all like someone who wants to harm Bitcoin. 
So what if he disagrees with people on a technical issue? -- it doesn't come close to him wanting to actually harm Bitcoin that's just not the case.

How is it working against Bitcoin for him to state his opinion on governance?
Those who disagree should, instead of attacking Allaire, explain why they feel Bitcoin governance is working.  
More important question: is it working?    This isn't a matter of whether you support the core dev team or various scaling solutions - just a discussion of whether the governance method is working or not.   At the very, very least there is a perception of it not working by at least a couple leading CEOs.

As predicted, this experiment failed miserably and of course resulted in even worse regulation proposal.  Now the solution CoinCenter will try is to go back and re-try to push the original bad regulation that got us into this situation in the first place.

For these apps we need to shift mindset from "I'll buy X mining rigs from Butterfly labs (joke) and pay Y for electricity at Z hash rate and earn ___ ROI"
"When I leave this thing plugged in in my office or dorm pretty much no one knows or cares what it generates or electricity it costs - it helps me be able to use cool apps and pay for stuff a couple pennies here and there without having to think about it - I can also charge up my account with 0.1 Bitcoin and pull right into parking spots in NYC and have them automatically paid"

Sure they might try to get back at activists who try to make life miserable for them -- that's what a fight is.  They are already our enemy and there isn't much worse they can do - in this case the guy already wants to wreck digital currency.  He's also a nobody Assemblyman so doesn't have tons he can do -- especially to people outside his state.
Dealing with a-holes like this guy is similar to dealing with gang members in the sense that logic and goodwill won't work -- he's an opportunist bully who places ambition above all else -- the benefit he gets from attacking crypto is minimal -- if the drawback is greater / too much of a hassle then there's a chance he'll back down just like the selectman I mentioned.

Bigger fish to fry folks.
Phil provided a lot of information and transparency of the type that should be encouraged.
I don't know if he was drinking, can't determine that from the audio.  
He was coherent and made sense, provided tons of info with maybe a couple sentences that were a little slow speech - but there could be other reasons for that such as being tired.  Not a big deal.
It's also not clear if this audio was taken with him thinking it would be private, it's a pretty casual conversation.  He should be held to what he says of course and in a crisis, the more info the better - but this is not a formal interview.
Personally I'd be inclined to give him a good degree of slack on this -- lets instead judge on substance of what he says.  
Even if he did drink I don't think that's a big deal -- esp after work hours, esp if he's making an effort to spend time being transparenct and also after what is likely one of the worst and most stressful weeks of his life.
He seems on the audio and elsewhere that he genuinely wants to make this right and knows that they messed up.  
Let's give him to benefit of the doubt unless he proves otherwise.

No, just pointing out that if you think those bylaws pose some unusual problem that it's a mistaken premise.

@_date: 2015-12-31 15:04:54
Thanks for the reply.
1- the board wasn't functional as it was - it just wasn't possible to continue with board members not even agreeing on whether the organization should exist - pretty much every board has procedures to remove a member and they followed the bylaws -- Bobby didn't take this lightly - the board tried to work together for 6+ months - I wish I would have been able to unite them but I couldn't 
The 3 new board members were the next three runners up in the last 2 elections - not an ideal situation but I don't know how else it could have gone
2) meeting minutes are open and have been since I volunteered - we publish them after every meeting 
3) the finances are open also, as soon as I volunteered I released the finances - the tax returns are released -- as for where the donations went it was mainly to salaries - there was a lot of waste and a lot of overspending on expensive lawyers, accountants, overpriced web services and a huge loss on the Amsterdam conference - they also had Bitcoin decline a lot - many bad decisions were made - I wasn't there and didn't have anything to do with those decisions - I wish they would have left the new admin a few hundred grand to operate - I've cut costs by 90%
3) what PR person are you referring to?  Jinyoung?  She was no longer with the foundation within 3 hours of me volunteering - not sure what her salary was and personal salaries are the one thing not released -- other than for Executive Director and board members which is zero at this time -
I think the overall PR at the foundation failed miserably
4) yes, lots of corporate members donated Bitcoin or cash - a few were given memberships for in kind donations such as legal work
5) not sure what else can be done about the focus on the past - I volunteered to help a turnaround - I knew it was broken going in, knew it needed fixing - I'd much rather work on something that helps Bitcoin

Example 2
Controversial post with much debate about a factual item.
Way buried in the comments is a link from someone to a YouTube video conclusively settling the debate with a factual statement from a party involved

Where does it say "flight".
Expenses are only paid if there is are receipts and in line with the reimbursement policy.
I dont recall what was said exactly - this is exactly the problem with attempting to take line by line notes - they come out terribly.   I can say that no one ever said it was for a flight and I dont think Jim or anyone else said it was "for going to London".  It might have been overall costs related to London -- 12k is possible for even direct costs if someone flew business class, depending on how many nights they stayed, if the event space was paid for etc.   I just dont know and its a three fold waste of time 1) we've never seen the bills or receipts 2) these expenses have not yet been paid and were not incurred or authorized during the time I was with the foundation 3) the Treasurer said its probably past the time of payment

I don't know how much was raised or spent, not sure if anyone knows for sure.
The foundation early on raised a lot of Bitcoin.  That Bitcoin went up at a rocket pace.  They then spent it at a very high rate.
The reason I don't have better figures is because it's old news and not as relevant and that no one involved in those decisions is still with the organization.
When I came aboard all we can do is look at where we are and where we can go.  I don't want to dwell on the past any more other than to learn from the mistakes of those before us.
Since I've come aboard we have raised very little, perhaps $10-15k and our spending is very low: about $7-8000 per month, down from a peak of more than 10 times that amount.

I understand your point - I've dealt with many lawyers and I give them a pretty wide latitude on how I judge them in relation to their clients. 
If a client asks for a certain action the lawyers have to do it in most cases.  Also, clients lie to lawyers all the time - even if the lawyer knows they are lying all they can do is advise against certain actions -- they have to proceed with the case based on what the client says.
Garza could do something crazy like file a suit against Reddit or Pres Obama - he could insist on some bad strategy like an insanity defense or say it was mistaken identity.  In some cases lawyers are stuck representing the wishes of people even if they disagree.  
For example in criminal cases if they know for sure someone is guilty and the person insists on claiming innocence they still have to represent them.   The options they have are to advise against and eventually to try to withdraw representation -- sometimes judges won't even allow lawyers to withdraw (even in cases when the client won't pay) - especially if there is a case well underway, an appeal or if prison is a possibility.
Legal cases are also very, very complex.  The fact is we just don't know exactly what happened and why any lawyers involved with Garza did anything.  They might have had to because it was the type of client request they needed to do even if being against it.  Garza might have lied to the lawyers or given them fraudulent documents.   Maybe they planned a defense based on certain minor details and it hinged on challenging some seemingly minor part of the articles something that could be a difference in number of counts etc.  In a case like this when a client is in major trouble they are often just trying to limit the damage - maybe get it down from 10 counts to 2 counts or admit fraud but fight the Federal wire fraud charge etc.  
I know Klein, I know that aside from Voorhees he has saved MANY good and prominent Bitcoin people and companies from trouble in cases he not only resolved but managed to keep out of the news.  I never discussed Garza with him and I'm sure he wouldn't due to attorney client privilege but my guess is that he thinks Garza is a scumbag and terrible for this industry as well as being stupid legally.  But Garza still deserves good representation and as horrible as his actions have been he should have a fair case based on real facts.

I am disagreeing.  You don't deserve the answers if someone doesn't want to answer unless you have a contractual agreement with them or they have harmed you or threatened you in some way.

Thanks for your comments.  The board bylaws were, I believe, copied from the MIT open source license or something similar so I don't think there is a structural issue.
As far as Olivier, I'm sorry it didn't work out -- I didn't vote on this btw -- but it's just not possible for a board to have continual differences of opinions like this.  It's simply not productive.   I wish it would have worked out but I'm glad we now have a board that's in agreement.  As a volunteer I honestly had no desire to work on an organization with a board that continually has infighting.  I also can't be expected to volunteer time when two board members did not support the organization and did not want it to succeed or exist.

I spoke with Olivier a month before the meeting and he consistently did not want to have the foundation exist.  At that time I asked what he would like to see happen if he could have a unanimous board vote and he replied that he'd like to see it shut down.
On this meeting it wasn't a matter of having the chance to make a plan (we'd also tried and failed for 6 months) butts whether we exist at all.
I think Olivier would say that some main problems were the name, the way he was poorly received when he started the board (I was not there) and that he didn't agree with the other members, particularly Bobby and Brock.
One way or another, that format didn't work.

I wish Amir would join up with Cody Wilson and create a Bitcoin advocacy group to fight regulation.
Some groups are very pro regulation.  The Bitcoin Foundation members overall are mostly anti-reg, I'm personally in favor of free markets and against regs.  However we also represent a wide membership and it wouldn't be serving them to actively seek fights with regulators.  
So if some other industry groups are the equivalent of the big coal lobby, the Bitcoin Foundation is Greenpeace, then what we need is an organization on the fringe being the Sea Sheperd of Bitcoin putting spikes in rainforest trees.  I'd personally rather not have Bitcoin Foundation be the sole opposing voice, it would be great if a real rebel organization was fighting this fight.

As for your questions: most are answered already.   1) Bitcoin Foundation posted a mission statement for comment -- if you agree with it you can support it, if not then you can support something else or nothing.    2) foundation has leaned a lot from previous drama -- a few takeaways are that personally I think that it's not logical to air all dirty laundery and internal disagreements, also makes sense to not try to be all things to all people and third I think it's important to not have low quality staff / board working on it 3) we are against regulation and believe in technical solutions rather than legal whenever possible 4) I offered to put in $10,000 of my own money -- I also take no salary and put in way, way more than that value in terms of donated volunteer time

Not sure if you actually read the headline or post.
The three candidates selected where all the next runners up in the last two elections (with the exception of me, I recused myself and declined the seat even though I was a runner up)
So they very much were voted for by members.
Of the two minority opinions who wanted to shut down the foundation, one resigned and one was voted off.  
It is the responsibility of any board member of an organization to have duty and care to not intentionally harm that organization.  This is a standard legally and across the world.  I don't know any board who would retain a member who wanted to destroy the organization the rest of the board represented.
The majority of the board also did not feel that there was a member mandate to shut down the foundation.   Based on feedback so far and the opinion of the next four runners up in the last two elections (that's 8 people total, 4 with the most votes who were elected and four more runners up) this opinion was correct.   What do you suggest instead?  The boards only other options were to go with the minority opinion and shut down or keep operating as an ineffective board with infighting for another six months and have a slow death by inaction...which is essentially also agreeing with the minority opinion.   What would you have done if you were a board member?

The Bitcoin Foundation has a variety of members with very varied opinions on the block size and fork.  For example, Gavin Andreesen is Chief Scientist, Peter Todd and many others are members.
I don't think consensus among members is clear enough for us to properly claim we are representing them with a strong opinion on either side of the issue.

1) It's one of the key benefits / differentiators of Reddit and is especially useful in an ever-changing space like this with real time news and info coming out.
2) It's also especially important in a format like this where we have 150,000 people ranging from the top CEOs and developers to newbies, trolls, geniuses, investors, academics and fools.
If there are 100 comments on something I want to eyeball it instantly and see if Gavin , Back, Brian Armstrong or Allaire has said something and upvotes make that easier.   I want to briefly skim over the bulk of comments, especially the silly or trollish and avoid wasting time and see the insightful and useful.  This sub and Reddit, despite its many faults, is an outstanding tool if we can sort the diamonds from the coal.

I really don't care about it that much.  I don't know why it's so difficult to accept that people have different opinions than yours. 
Andreas, Peter Todd and others disagree with Jerry on this.
Can you list for me the regulatory authorities you have been governed by, what supervisory / compliance positions you and the supports of this program have held with self regulatory agencies and how many times they have reported to regulators with audits and other reporting?  Can you also point to successful industry examples of organization alliances who have a stated goal of helping to catch "bad guys"?

Ridiculous.  Can you show me where I "begged" that Garza keep his spot or dismissed accusations?  You are talking about something from what, a year ago.  All I had said was that Moe, the organizer, was not the enemy and I stand by that.  By asking for more evidence are you talks about the bounty that I put out for details, info and timeline on Garza?   Do you think that this was some sort of favor to him?
Even more baffled by the second part of your comment.  Are you suggesting I host an event and don't "invite myself"?   Yes, people contribute to registration - the owner/ organizers of conferences front the money, pay the bills and, no, they don't typically contribute themselves.  
Are you aware of some new meeting model that doesn't work this way?

We've rehashed this quite a bit.  
If that vision is one of whether to exist or not then, yes, you are correct.  (Although one member resigned and was not voted out.)
The other two board members voted to close the foundation.  There was not an alternative vision that was presented.  
Do you wish for the foundation to close?  If so then there isn't anything I can do about that, your opinion is in a minority as reflected by me and seven board members and our opinion of what membership wants as well as the research and informal polling (such as Consider-It) we've done.
If you wish for it to remain open, then you agree with the rest of the board on at least that issue.

Thank goodness I'm not smart enough to be a dev.

Thanks for taking the time to think on this Charles... I think this comment illustrates one fundamental problem with your article.
When you talk about the Bitcoin Foundation and say "They" did any of these things -- it's important to not that the current people didn't....past administrations did.  
They did what they did, I get the criticism.  For the things we can undue I've worked to do that....but we are where we are now.  This thing exists, it's here and it's an opportunity or mess that belongs to everyone -- it's no more my foundation than it is yours...in fact I'm newer and was an opponent until I joined.
Same goes for focusing on the financials past, I just don't see how an audit benefits anyone at this point.  You don't really think people who are strong critics will suddenly say "Oh, finally, we proved that the foundation wasted money and past people involved were bad actors.  I have no problem with this group now." right?
We all know that the old members of the foundation burned through lots of money, they also lost millions on the decline in Bitcoin value.  We all know that past people made errors and that we had bad apples.  What could an audit show that we don't already know?  Unless we can collect some huge six figure pile of cash that someone squirreled away then I don't see the use of what it could show,   Surely it couldn't be much worse right?  It's not like we could find even more wasted money than we knew of.
It would make total sense of the people involved were still there: hold them accountable, fire them if needed or sue them or whatever.  But they are not there anymore.
I'd be more than happy to release any records of current spending or any spending I've approved or been responsible for...that makes perfect sense.  This is a turnaround situation -- when a person or team is brought in to fix something the only thing they need to know about the past is enough to not repeat the same mistakes and to collect or close any relevant loops.
If this whole thing was dumped in your lap and you had total control, would an audit really be the priority?   IMHO we've got to get out and get some stuff done -- especially stuff that people care about and that helps Bitcoin.   I volunteered because I think the org is worth existing and can help Bitcoin.   I didn't sign on to be Peter Vs auditor or bill collector...I don't care what he did, I know he harmed the foundation and I know he owes the foundation money and I have not been able to identify any major possible red flags related to fraud or theft etc.   Remmember - the foundation had lawyers, bookkeepers and major auditors and accountants -- in very general terms we can see where the money went and there is no large unaccounted for or unexplained missing chunk.  Did they way overspend and get hit with a double whammy of the Bitcoin drop?   Yep.

True, not flawless.
But without the voting system it doesn't factor anything at all.  
The problem is exactly the general populace having the same weight.
Without votes, a comment from Jeremy Allaire has exactly the same weight as a comment from a 14 year old kid with an OCD trolling compulsion.
/ A comment well thought out or pointing to a highly relevant and factual link to key data has the same weight as a fart joke.  
Even blatantly offensive, hateful, inane, incorrect or off topic idiocies are not collapsed even under the clicks of 100 down votes.   I don't see how this is better.
Up voting is far from perfect and I agree, there is not tons of value in the overall community quality...but overall I think it's helped quality be seen more than no voting would.

This is a very short quote from a third party in a conference and needs context to be worth anything at all.
I saw Joi speak at the event with Gavin a couple weeks ago at MIT and he seemed to have a pretty good stance / outlook on regulations.  
It wasn't the topic of the forum and he was moderator, not speaker but what little he did say seemed very sensible to me as a person who believes Bitcoin should not be regulated.
Does he mean regulators may cause the mess?  Does he mean devs in general never listen to any regulators or does he mean this is willful and related to Bitcoin specifically?  Is he stating it as a blanket fact, as in, "people don't read TOS agreements"?
No way to know from this short tweet / no context.
In any event, this is certainly not close to any basis to criticize the guy.  Wait until he actually has a complete and specific statement to evaluate if it's something you agree with or not.
Ito is an incredibly impressive professional BTW: by far one of the most solid bios of anyone involved in this industry.
He's also hardly an ivory tower "academic" as some suggest.  He spent ages as an incredibly successful venture capitalist and technologist.
He was appointed to this role a few years back...one of the most important and high profile jobs at MIT....with....get this...no college degree.  That in itself is pretty impressive.  Read up on him and you might see why MIT made this unconventional choice.
He might lean on the pro-reg side of things (though I got no impression of that from what I saw) but even if so he should be listened to and respected IMHO.

No, obviously I did not charter a private jet with foundation money.
I have never taken any salary from the Foundation.  
My total expenses ever reimbursed are only for hard fixed costs for items that I have paid and have a receipt for such as web hosting, servers etc, likely a couple thousand dollars.  The only travel related expenses the foundation has ever reimbursed me for are the DevCore event in San Jose which included coach flight, flights for speakers (coach) hotel a meal for speakers of about $100 and pizza for the attendees (about $300).
If people judge my reputation on the acts of others then that is their issue not my own.

TLDR:  Bitcoin Foundation is an industry group that was created in the very earliest days of Bitcoin.  Since it was first it grew rapidly and became powerful and had significant funds.  It has had its share of of controversy with one former board member running the defunct MxGox exchange and another being convicted of failure to file a report for a money transmitter.
The foundation had growing pains and went through leadership changes.  Most recently the foundation has become low on capital.  The current board disagreed over direction and now one member resigned and the other was removed. 
@_date: 2015-12-24 01:43:57
?  This is ancient news.
No one involved now was involved in this mess.  The people at the foundation are the ones who came in to fix the previous mess.

The foundation never really controlled code but it is definitely better now that core dev funding is not as needed.  When the foundation started the main purpose was to pay Gavin -  this is in an early day when most people could barely conceive of this crazy technology becoming such a big deal that funding devs would be less an issue.

While haters gonna hate.  I always liked 21 and had faith they'd do great things.
IMHO the criticism of the Bitcoin computer as a "Raspberry Pi with a mining chip" misses the point.
I think they are taking the longer game and working to build something very serious and major.  
It might work, might not but people who discount someone like Balaji as lucky or newer to Bitcoin or whatever are nuts.  He knows how to build, execute and forward think at a level that, frankly, most people in Bitcoin have never even seen.   I don't mean that as an insult, it's just a fact in a newer space like this.   As for their plan, there is no way the original end game was to sell a $400 consumer products to a niche market.
Bitcoiners tend to dismiss newer people or discount non-Bitcoin expertise.  Balaji is smarter and more connected than most people can imagine.  Don't underestimate how fast people can learn and adapt as well.   This goes for Blyth Masters as well BTW -- yesterday some were ridiculing that she got "only" $7.5 million in venture funding.  Although I agree that her plans seem to miss the value of the Bitcoin blockchain over private blockchains there's no way I'd bank on her being a failure.
It's true that excelling in one area doesn't mean you will excel in another but those who bet against the excellent are making a risky bet.

It's not censoring -- it's redacting -- our minutes are by far the most open and transparent of any organization of any kind I've ever seen.  Most organizations don't even release board minutes and all who do redact items -- none I know of are anywhere near the level of detail of these.   Can you point to any?

Yes in this case the Bitlicense regulates technology itself including app development - this is not only unusual it's imorral as there is no clear victim if this was violated.  Ultimately it does come down to regulations banning math -- in the other examples something else was violated.
There is no such thing as "society" it's a made up term used often by those people who want to compel different people to do something.  Many of the great evils in history were done in the name of "society" -- we only have actual humans...people -- in the case of starting forest fires or oil spills those things clearly and obviously have actual human victims beyond something called society.   Again you are comparing actual bad acts: Madoff, oil spills etc - to failure to comply with made up regs which is not a bad act that in itself harms anyone at all.

If we agree that intellectual property is property first, we'd also have to be fair that the punishment fits the crime for theft.  Same reason we can't stab someone for stealing a slice of pizza from us.
There are definitely much better states and regs.  Massachusetts for example has a much better attitude than Lawsky (not perfect) - they focus on consumer protection not furthering their own career etc.

Good article, the title initially scared me a bit for worries it was a proposal of a more centralized solution but It's covered about 3/4 through.
Bitnation is interesting -- I've had some doubts but they seem to be working hard - hopefully they do well.
The killer app would be if the true decentralized power of the tech is harnessed...so the change comes not from or driven by governments, but by such effective adoption by the people that governments then work to proactively accept it...while still not having controls which could lead to abuses like the 'no fly list'.
The most amazing questions that blockchain tech causes us to ask is "Why do we need these guys?" be it insurance companies, banks, governments etc.  We can ask what service they really provide and if it is genuinely needed or could it be done (potentially even done better) by a non centralized, open party instead of a trusted or powerful third party.   
The answer is clear for banking: the main feature they offer of verifying value is obsolete - it could take decades to be realized but it's clear.   Identity and things like land ownership titles etc are brilliant use cases.   It's a changing world.

So let me get this straight -- you are criticising me, a volunteer, for not proactively researching, finding out your organization existed and then cold calling / reaching out to you on the assumption that you wanted to work with the Bitcoin Foundation?   
Since I'd have no way of knowing your group existed, I assume you think I should be doing so not just for your organization and Kenya but for the whole world, correct?   How many hours of my time do you think I should spend on this?
I had nothing to do with the affiliate program.  
I'm happy to have volunteers and partner with people and groups who'd like to but this is volunteer driven and grassroots.  
One of the challenges with open source projects is that people seem to think that they own the labor of others and that other people owe them something in terms of time or commitments.   I do what I can and honestly put far too much time and effort into this volunteer work.  
If you think the affiliate program can be improved / fixed then do it.  The foundation is just as much yours as it is mine.   Be the change you want to see.

Bitcoin is a community with an inordinate amount of complaints about people doing volunteer work.
I've met her many times, she's a character, so what, everyone is in some way.
I don't see the need or benefit of publicly trashing on someone.
She is working in her own way to benefit Bitcoin and the organizer said she did put together this panel...which...by the way was one of the best groups ever gathered for a panel even before the Craig Wright news.   People are busting on the woman who gave us the only video any has ever seen of this guy talking about Bitcoin.
So Goldman Sachs is not going to make her the spokesperson - who cares.  These things are harder to do than it seems.  You also can't see the behind the scenes story from a video like this - someone could have lost their notes, had a computer crash 4 minutes before taking the state or received an emergency text from a family member or 100 other things.

Your claim is that seemingly ONLY GitHub commits and similar means someone is an expert.  So Steve Waterhouse isn't?  Jeremy Allaire?

That language in the bylaws is referring to if there is a special purpose board meeting - it required 2 days notices so someone cannot blindside the rest of the board with 40 minutes notice of a meeting or something along those lines.

I've also learned from traveling to the Middle East about 50 times as a civilian and visiting every single Gulf country that I was lied to when I enlisted, just as the enlisted are lied to today along with the public.
Being against our current foreign policy is not to be in favor of people dying or unsympathetic to victims -- it's a matter of having a different opinion on the best way to reduce that violence.  We have more terrorists now than we did after 9-11 -- ISIS arose directly as a result of our actions just as we helped create Ossama and the Taliban with our misguided adventures aiming to help the Mujahideen fight the Soviets.
I could just as easily say that someone in favor of our failed foreign policy should stand outside the funerals of those murdered.
As for KYC I think it's convenient to blame terrorism and violence on bad KYC - Ben Lawsky had the nerve to invoke 9-11 in his Bitlicense hearings for example - but I think it's far more often a crime where the only victim is the State and is mostly used for the collection of taxes.  It's also a relatively new concept to simply assume that government has the right to view, access and control the funds of citizens.  For a very long time it was not like this.

"Those actions do not support or oppose any specific regulations."  See, on this, I'm sorry but this is factually incorrect.  Coincenter absolutely DOES support specific regulations.  They have a roadmap created which lists the idea regulation they'd like to see in each state and they have actively worked to write and lobby for passage of regulations such as AB 1326 -  this isn't disputed.
I dont think anyone would reasonably think that my opinions reflect "everybody involved in Bitcoin".  
I dont use the foundation for my agenda - my Facebook page existed long before I ever did anything with the foundation.  My social media presence is far larger than the foundation's is and has been for a long time.  Not sure what types of organizations you are looking at - take a look at the top 100 largest non-profits and the boards / directors - its overwhelmingly dominated by political activists, former politicians, political fundraisers and others who are very active and open with opinion.
The foundation is in compliance with our IRS status.  As a 503c6 we absolutely are allowed to engage in political activities- even though we dont use that ability much at all.  Its also separate from what I say personally - comments made by a director are not assumed to be the official positions of an organization unless expressed.
The foundation did take a position on the California AB1326 bill.  Although we were hardly active with it - the education committee wrote a letter and the foundation account made a couple posts in support of the EFF 
I don't think you have so much of an issue with an organization or director speaking about politics, just that you disagree with me and the EFF.

Good points but I think you are arguing a bit of a strawman -- I don't know many ancaps... Certainly not me - who are against all initiated violence.
My personal belief is that violence should only be used in defense or in reaction to someone's life liberty or property being violated -- this isn't something I came up with just now, I've said it a hundred times...it's an idea I use often.  Where I focus effort is on defining what is an act of aggression that violates the non aggression principle -- for me drunk driving meets the criteria.  I would guess that 99% of ancaps would agree that theft would qualify.
You repeated above pretty much exactly what I said about drunk driving.

This is the drawback of over-pushing adoption rather than tech and ease of use.
If we hound a tiny merchant into accepting Bitcoin they are likely to not recieve much tangible benefit or sales increase - it is also harder for them to train employees etc.
Then they cancel it and it's 5 times harder to get them to sign on later.
Better to focus on the tech, development and making it easier and better...then adoption will come.

Yes I deleted that post a couple days after I became Executive Director -- the reason I deleted it is because I didn't think it was productive and isn't a post I would have made or approved.
I'm pretty sure Olivier and I discussed the post and agreed it should be deleted.
The original post was posted by the communications person for the foundation as far as I know and was in reply to Olivier Janseens Reddit post and made accusations that Olivier gave incorrect information.
As Executive Director I want to work with all board members -- I think Olivier could have done things in a more tactful way but I did not feel it was appropriate to have the Bitcoin Foundation blog argue with an elected board member.  
I did not like the response or its tone and it didn't reflect the best direction (in my opinion) for the foundation.

This is honestly one of the stupidest wastes of time I've ever seen in my life.
What a colossally unproductive and useless thing.
1) yes the foundation has agreed to have this vote -- no, this website is not the vote 
2) if people don't like the Bitcoin Foundation or the Burger King Fan Club or the Donald Trump Campaign or the NRA or r/Bitcoin - it's very simple - don't join
3) Bitcoin Foundation posted a mission statement two weeks ago at Github Bitcoin FoundationPlan -- why not read through the plan and comment on what you agree with/ disagree with or want to see changed?   
The plan is basically:  
1) activities to increase education and adoption, for example the speakers bureau which includes many too names, the press engagement etc.
2) fostering core development and communication - working to host more events like DevCore: Develop the Developers and working to bridge the gap in knowledge between what is important in Bitcoin Dev and what the public, CEOs and others know
3) working against harmful regulations in favor of technical and voluntary solutions 
Which of these three activities so you hate so much that you not only don't want to help or support but you want to go out of your way to proactively stop someone else from doing it?
What specific problem do you have with current leadership?  What decisions do you disagree with?
Please comment -- this is what the foundation is focused on now and unified by a unanimous board made up of the    2 &amp; 3 and the  &amp; 5 voted candidates from the last three elections.
This foundation belongs to Bitcoin -- if you want to help or dislike this mission then now is your chance to comment and ask for change.
The past is the past - wasting time and energy focusing on mistakes of old administrations and people no longer there is almost as much of an insane waste as proactively working to try to destroy an organization.
I'd much, much rather focus on productive activities that help Bitcoin: conferences and other events, development learning initiatives and trying to stop harmful regulations.

Olivier has strong principles and cares a lot about Bitcoin.  I'm glad to have met him.  
As he mentioned, he also succeeded in calling for more transparency, one of the most requested items of feedback from the public.
As I said on the call today, there is no shame in not agreeing or even not getting along.  People have different opinions and different ideas.  As Bobby said in his letter it doesn't mean someone is right or wrong.
Disagreeing about the direction or future of a non-profit in Bitcoin is really not that big of a deal in the grand scheme of humanity.  
All board members agree on far more in the world than they disagree on - they all choose to be involved in this tech that only a fraction of the rest of people have ever heard of.
The only reason for any disagreement is because they all care.  I have no doubt that Jim, Olivier and every board member wants what is best for Bitcoin.
I want the remaining board to succeed and I'll try to help as much as I can.
I dont vote at meetings and its not my role to second guess votes.  One good part of this is that we now have a unified board.  It would matter a lot less whether Jim &amp; Olivier stayed and Brock / Bobby left or the way it turned out --  what matters is that the board functions and gets along -- no matter who has what opinion, its key for a board to function well.  So if that can happen then I am sorry it did not work out for everyone but have hopes in the future.
Thanks again to Olivier and Jim and thanks also the the other members.

There are matters of member privacy discussed often.  We did release the 2014 990 form and it likely got a lost/ broken link in the transition to the new website a few weeks ago.  I can make sure its re-posted.
Transparency is only useful if it doesn't detract from getting important things actually done.
1) we have far more transparency than any other organization in the industry - or organizations in general
2) people seem to hold the foundation to a standard different from every other organization in, or even outside of bitcoin
Nothing at all is a "secret" we air internal board disputes, struggles etc far more than any organization I've ever heard of.
To be honest I think its a draining waste of time.

Malware also has victims -- I don't think creating it should be illegal (and it isn't as far as I know) but using it should be.
No I don't think that Bitlicense would have prevented Mt Gox but clearly it has victims.  Heavy regulation doesn't stop theft or fraud -- Bernie Maddof was not only heavily regulated and had a 17 page tip in him sent to the SEC, he was Chair of the regulatory affairs committee of the largest regulator.  So often these regs don't stop crime but burden companies and stifle innovation. 
When I was governed by NASD (the group Maddof was Chair of) they had a requirement that all email must be monitored and can't be deleted.  How much theft and fraud does this stop?  About zero -- any crook is simply going to create a separate email address and not tell the regulators it exists.
To prevent another Mt Gox the best bet IMHO is technical solutions and internal industry solutions - such as independent audits etc.  The best role of government would be in enforcement when real crimes with victims are committed.  This is something theve been horrible at -- letter scams, penny stock fraud etc. are rampant and regulators are too lazy to pursue.  Lawsky represents NY citizens who lost money on Gox and as far as I know he did nothing, not even a letter to Japan, to offer help or ask for results of the investigation etc.

Saying Bitcoin Foundation is bankrupt is simply a false statement, bankrupt is a specific term and we are absolutely not bankrupt in any way.
If you have specific allegations of corruption, bring them forward.
Irrelevancy is a matter of opinion.  We may not be relevant to everyone but we have by far the largest membership base of any such organization in Bitcoin, we fund Bitcoin.org the largest Bitcoin related education site, we have hosted some of the most successful events in the space, we sent one of the most detailed replies to Bitlicense, we have hosted DevCore, imteracted with the press hundreds of times and referred hundreds of speakers to discuss Bitcoin at events and we have a fully elected board and model of transparency and governance which is at a higher standard than the vast majority of non profits.

Standing against BitLicense is a core action we have done and something that most members support.
If this sounds like it's creating drama then I appologize.  In my opinion the actions of Lawsky are reprehensible and corrupt and standing against them should not be sugar coated or placed in more politically correct terms.
Lawsky has created laws no one wanted, from a position which he was not elected to...almost certainly in action contrary to what voters would have voted for and definitely contrary to what the industry thought was reasonable.  He did so while running a massive media show to further his own fame and pretend to listen to feedback while really taking his direction from banks...and now he will leave just weeks after creating this mess....and become a consultant earning money advising on these same laws.

So the actions of someone three executive directors ago are relevant to what people trying to turn around the mess he created is still relevant?
Just curious as to your logic:  is this true of all turnarounds?  Is everyone who ever works on something that was broken doomed be be judged for the actions of those who are broken?
Does this mean no one should ever work to fix anything that's broken because someone broke it?
Do you criticize political figures for the actions of those they replace?
Seriously -- I'm curious how you feel the actions of Peter Vessenes are relevant today.

Olivier, one of my only accomplishments might have been being able to maintain decent relations with all members of a fractured board and hopefully can continue that now.
But honestly can you say that there is any plan you would have agreed to that the board would have agreed to as well?
When you and I spoke a month ahead I asked a few times what you'd like to see happen if you had a unanimous board and your first choice was to shut it down.
You also never made a proposal or motion of how you'd like to see it change.   This is not a slam against you as I didn't make one either...neither did Jim, Bobby, Brock, Micky or Elizabeth.   No one did.  But the notion that you wanted reform, if we are honest, was not backed by any motion, plan or vote.   You could have had the board pass almost anything -- but didn't propose it.
Now I know (or guess) that part of the reason is that you were disillusioned from the start.  You mentioned the first board meeting and your poor reception (I wasn't there) -- but either way...for whatever reason it wasn't working.  If Bobby and Brock left and you and Jim stayed it might have worked well also -- I don't think the makeup was ideal and I'm surprised you didn't resign when Jim did.  You couldn't have been thinking it would work.
I don't say this against you -- just that the makeup didn't work.  Not anyone's fault.   
And by the way, in reply to your post on my other comment -- I didn't mean to lay all blame on the board -- it could very well be my fault or some other factor.

The majority of the fully 100% member elected board disagrees on shutting the foundation down.
Under what grounds does Andreas suggest that we go with a minority opinion?
(BTW - I think that ALSO many of the people who did elect the minority side board members did not elect them for the purpose of shutting the foundation down.)
Board members have a duty of care obligation to not harm the organization they serve on.  Jim voluntarily stepped down because he didn't think the organization should exist.  
The remaining board members voted off Olivier in a 4/1 vote because they felt it was impossible to reconcile a member who seeks destruction of an organization with those who want it to survive (and who feel that their best representation of members is to keep it operating) they tried for 5-6 months to get him to propose any alternative....he never did.  (In fairness no one else did either)
Should they have let the minority opinion rule the day and simply ignored their own take of what the members who elected them asked for?   Should the 4/6 have acquiesced to the 2/6?   Or should they have simply acquiesced with a slow death by spending another 6 months with no vote of any use?
Attacking us now is an easy cheap shot that is great for easy social media likes but you Andreas did it without having the full set of facts that I offered to provide him.
Andreas was instrumental as one of the first prominent voices to make it popular to bash the foundation with his  now famous "the foundation has no transparency" tweet.   This was actually untrue at the time -- the foundation had an elected board, public minutes and fully released financials when he made that tweet.
Now we have him as a prominent voice again calling shut down.   We have hundreds of people in chapters across the world who feel this organization should exist.
Who is Andreas to decree something that is against the majority of the fully member elected board?  By what right do we have to destroy something that these people feel they were elected to repair?
Aside from this, regarding the board seat --  Would Andreas or anyone else serve on a board with someone who actively sought its destruction? 
I respect Andreas and think he is one of the greatest speakers we have.  I think he has an ethical compass which is nearly unmatched in our industry.
Unfortunately on this I don't think he has all the facts.
I'm severely disappointed in this tweet from him.  Hopefully we can remain friends as this would be a poor thing to have long term discord over.

I don't know why he didn't resign.  Before he ran for office he offered a $100,000 reward to anyone who could replace the foundation.
As recently as one month before the meeting I asked him what he would like to see done with the foundation if he had a full board vote to do anything and he said he wanted to shut it down.
The funds we spend now are about 5% of what peak spending was.  Right now that consists of a part time bookeeper who pays bills, tracks passwords etc. and an almost full time COO/ ops/ admin person who has assumed all roles previously handled by over a dozen staff: fielding press and membership inquiries, arranging speakers, setting the board calls and other admin tasks.
Aside from this we spend a very small amount on things like web hosting etc.  The costs of both employees and all other expenses are in the neighborhood of $6-7,000 per month.
Our discussion this week was that in order to continue operating we need to raise funds to cover these basic expenses or shut down.

I make an effort to avoid posting anything that isn't backed up.  If I mischaracterized you as supporting Lawsky supporter then I apologize.  
We have a difference of opinion on regulation it seems.  I agree with the EFF that we should not encourage new regulation and that politicians should hold off on regulation of Bitcoin, better yet make exceptions to give this tech a chance to move freely and unimpeded.  I understand the argument behind things like the California bill proposed by CoinCenter: that if we don't ask for regs like this then existing regs will be interpreted or worse new regs will be used.  I come out on the same side as the EFF on this. 
You may also disagree with my political opinions, that's okay, most people believe in and support the two parties or something else different than me.  Personally I think that support of leading candidates like Sanders with his unworkable math model and vilification of a fairly phony "billionaire class", Trump with his recent calls to ban entry to the US based on religion, Hillary with her track record of supporting wars of aggression which have not served us etc are just as nuts as you may think my opinions are.   But I still respect people with those opinions and, despite what you may think, I don't use the Bitcoin Foundation as a platform for my political beliefs.   I'd like to have membership represent as wide a cross section of Bitcoin as possible.

That's a great question and exactly the type of thing that people considering new laws should consider.  Each person has thier own idea about what being a victim means.  Some people think that if someone calls them a name or hurts thier feelings they should be jailed.
In the example of drunk driving, personally I think that the danger of this qualifies as a threat much like someone shooting a gun where bullets go over your property (even if the bullets don't hit anyone) so yes I think that drunk driving does have a victim - I feel threatened by drunk drivers to a similar level as if someone verbally threatened me or brandished a weapon at me.  But that is only my opinion, maybe I'm wrong.  It's a good debate to have but I think most people agree with this example.  I don't think most people feel threatened or otherswise victims of non compliance with Bitlicense to any degree close to drunk driving.
If someone says "I'm going to bash your head with a bat" - one could argue that this harms no one and in fact some people would not be bothered by this....however (in my opinion and the current laws in the US) this is assault, violates another person and should be illegal.
The debate comes down to whether someone is a victim or not.  If you don't think there is a victim of drunk driving as you said above I disagree.  That's a great debate to have : who is a victim and by what definition.   In cases of theft or violence it's obvious and clear -- in the case of verbal threats it could be less clear and in the case of someone offending another person in my opinion it should not be illegal -- many disagree.
To apply this to BitLicence fairly - we should take the laws and ask "who is the victim if this is violated" for each provision.
Many regulators don't even pretend there are or discuss victims -- they simply push for these things because that's the way it has been -- it gets more and more removed from an actual victim and more focused on the illusion of prevention of crimes which may never exist and are often covered by other laws already.

I can't speak for before I came but in the 7 months I was there, Olivier never made one motion, proposal or agenda item request.  So I can't see how he was stonewalled.  If anything the stonewalling was caused by focus on minutiae.  It's not as if there were tons of proposals and motions being denied by the board...if fact there were zero.
After months and months of nothing happening I even asked Olivier what his ideal thing to do would be if he could have a 100% vote and he said it would be to close the foundation.
But that's beside the point - the main fact is that this dynamic didn't work.  Maybe that was Olivier's fault, maybe Brock's, maybe mine or some other factor...but no one can deny that it didn't work and was ineffective.   The board got more done in the last 6 days than the last 6 months.  Continuing another 6 months as we were would not have gotten anything positive done.
It doesn't matter if Jim and Olivier had the most brilliant plans in the world....the dynamic didn't work for whatever reason.  It's not as if we waited one more month the board would have suddenly gotten along or if we just waited two months months then Olivier would have made some amazing motion that turned things around.   
It didn't work.  It was inefficient, toxic and no fun for anyone involved and wasn't helping Bitcoin as much as it could.  (I've said before that I don't blame Olivier on this, it could have been other members fault, my fault or any number of factors).  When something is broken it needs to change -- had Brock and Bobby been in the minority they could have been voted off or the foundation would now be shut down. 
We can only now move forward and see if this new makeup works.  Selecting all of the next runners up from elections is the most fair method I can think of to fill these new seats.  The decision to change the election portion of the bylaws will be left to the membership.  Personally I see no evidence that elections help an organization like this in any way so I'm going to strongly recommend that the membership vote to change those bylaws, but it is their decision.
The decision to remove Oliviier had nothing at all to do with some fear of a power shift on Dec 31.  First off, the appointments were the next candidates who were runners up...so are very representative of what the next election might have looked like.   I even recused myself and the next seat was offered to Francis who none of us have ever met.  If Brock was attempting some sort of power grab wouldn't he have worked to appoint someone who is on his side or at least someone he has met?  The appointments were not shady in any way.
People act as if this is the ghost of Saddam Hussien reaching for Saurons ring of power to rule Mordor.   It's 6 guys and one woman and a handful of volunteers who put on a couple events.  There is not some major power to grab...there is no way to control the Bitcoin core or anything else, we all have more money on our phone than the foundation has.   There was no meaningful vote in the last six months.  What exactly would be the motivation of this sort of banana republic coup that you mention?  Does Bobby Lee, CEO of one of the largest exchanges and one of the largest mining pools wish to co-opt the foundation so he can finally push through some secret plan that Plivier would have stood against?   Think it through.  There is nothing nefarious here.   The past situation didn't work out so it was changed and the people involved want to help Bitcoin- that's it.

How on earth is it relevant to mention Roger Ver's legal issues?  He was a donor.  Those acts occured long before the foundation existed.  He was always honest about them.  No one at the foundation now was there when Roger gave the donation.

As I've said many, many times in this thread - the headline saying it was "for a flight" is total BS.
The minutes said it was for London and even this was not accurate - the minutes should have said "such as" London.
In London alone there was an event that included room rental, AV, food likely advertising, transportation and freelancer expenses - not to mention the cost of getting multiple people over there -- some or all of these expenses could have been paid out of pocket by Patrick or others - not to mention numerous other expenses.  He could have had expenses of $100,000 and it would not be unusual depending on how far back it went and what exactly it was for.
The headline is silly.
At DevCore I paid for pizzas for the attendees, we ran out and Amy, ops director ordered more - we were both reimbursed.   One could write "Fenton and colleague spend $300 each on a slice of pizza"  doesn't mean its not BS/ taken out of context.

People say this often but it's not exactly true. You still legally own your coins just as much as you legally own the cash in your bank account or your home even though you may not control the babk backend or the deed.
It is fair to say that you don't have total control and this is a valid concern but you do own your funds and have a right to them.
For this specific example it would be fair to have more info or Circle's side of the story.  For example the OP didn't mention what country he or she is in.  If it is Iran for example then Circle would have no choice but to close the account because of US law.

This was before I came aboard - main expenses were salaries for 3 core developers, exec director, and many other staff as well as expenses related to the very large Amsterdam conference.  The foundation also funded the Bitnodes project, funded Bitcoin.org and made other grants etc. and ran a DevCore event that year.
Spending was high, clearly this was a problem - the decisions were made when bitcoin was at a much higher price and the business environment was different.  I have no desire to second guess decisions from one, two or three Executive Directors ago, everyone does the best they can relative to the environment they are working in.

That is honestly one of the most silly, poorly thought out and weak arguments in a long, long line of criticisms of the Bitcoin Foundation.
Klein is a DEFENSE attorney - his JOB is to defend people.  
Whoever wrote this seems to have no earthly clue about the most basic understanding of how the justice system works.  
Everyone is entitled to defense representation -- even if you dislike them, think they are guilty or even if they definitely are guilty....even if they PLEAD guilty and admit a very horrible crime like murder.  Everyone deserves a defense attorney who can advocate for them and what is legal based on the law.   Without this there would be absolutely no counter balance to the prosecution.  I feel like my brain cells are dying just because I have to explain something so unbelievably and ridiculously obvious.
Also, what on earth is Erik Voorhees doing in the article at all?  Erik getting a minor fine by the SEC is not a major deal, is not even a real strike against Erik - he presumably made an error and he paid a price.  It sure as hell isnt a strike against Klein.  (Even sillier yet is the attempt to someone make this a Bitcoin Foundation issue...apparently the writer is unaware that the foundation has hundreds of members).  Ridiculous.
So Garza is a bad guy.  What is Klein supposed to do say "Sorry, I do  criminal defense, but only for people who are good guys that people like."   Seriously, think it through for even five seconds or so.  What exactly do you propose??   Should a criminal defense attorney specializing in drunk driving refuse to accept clients who drink or clients who kill someone when driving?  What exactly should Klein have done differently?   Anyone dealing with him "deserves punishment"?  Seriously?  Because he defended a bad guy?  
Does this policy apply to all attroneys or is Klein special?
Do you just simply not believe in defense attorneys at all?  The only other way it seems possible to have a defense attorney who never represented a bad guy would be to get one right out of school and be his or her very first case.  Does this make sense?
My estate planning attorney doesn't even handle criminal matters but after 20 years, one night a client called him and said he was in jail for murdering his wife.  The estate attorney, went to the jail, told him not to discuss the case and arranged for a criminal attorney to handle the case the next day.  So is my estate planning attorney a bad guy also?
It's really stunning that Bitcoin is still such a new industry that such stunning stupidity still rears its head.

Well we know for certain that compliance costs are in the tens of billions of dollars annually -- we can see this by reviewing annual reports of companies and their own expenses for compliance.
We also know that regulators levy billions in fees.
We also can see the press releases of the people the regulators caught and we can see that major cases like Madoff slip through due to lazy enforcement, not lack of regs.
In 22 odd years of dealing with regulators I've just never seen a compelling case of why we need anything close to the level of regulation we have...and I haven't seen any evidence that it stops crime...in fact I personally think it makes crime worse because so many enforcement resources are focused on honest people and dotting i's rather than those actually committing fraud.

I'm a Middle East specialist, I've traveled to every single country in the gulf states, I'm a veteran, I owned a 25 security company whose clients include DoD, FBI, Homeland Security, Army, Navy and White House,  I've met at least 40 ambassadors and former ambassadors from Mid East countries, I've met most living rulers of Mid East nations, I've met the last two commanders of CENTCOM, the Deputyy Commander of CENTCOM, countless members of the intel community and I've even met Taliban and extremists.  I live in the Middle East sox months of each year and I've been doing this for a decade.
In my opinion the blog post was total BS.  No one has to listen or agree -- if they have better exterminate, more knowledge about the region or listen to someone else who does who disagrees that's fine.

That subscribes to a premise that regulators and government will be more on the ball and will know what they are talking about more than private companies.
Blockchain fixed the error within hours of it being noted on this sub.  Would the IRS or Department of Homeland Security fix something as fast?
Private companies and individuals can make mistakes, be incompetent, greedy, even crooks.   But so can government.   The difference is that government actions are backed by jails and guns and are much harder to undo.

Yes for valuation we didn't talk numbers but our assumption was that Mark thought Gox was worth much more than we thought it was.

- I haven't read it
- I don't think I have a "history of deleting comments" you are no doubt referring to the post on Buttcoin today which others in the brigade are mentioning where the user referenced a post from some time back where I deleted comments,  I did not delete these comments because I was "losing an argument" but because I felt the argument devolved to the point of being ridiculous and brought out a response from me I was not happy with -- I try to keep things civil and logical -- in that case I don't think it was and my comments were also misunderstood causing the entire thread to be off track.
I have no fear of debate or questions - this AMA is an example, my Facebook page is a better example.  I have a lot of posts between various social media.   On rare occasions I delete some, the most common reason is if something was misunderstood and can be clarified or if I say something that I do not actually feel or think is unproductive.

There is a difference between customers and companies.
In this example -- if Bitcoin was regulated the way FINRA is then these regs would apply to companies and professionals: Coinbase, Bitpay, me etc. not to individual clients of the companies (for example obviously a client of Merrill Lynch doesn't have his personal email addresses reviewed)
But there are still some things which are a pain for clients:  continual KYC and AML and Patriot Act requirements etc.   I once had a client die and his brother (who was his executor) needed the funds from his account to save the home my clients widow and daughters lived in....they almost lost it due to the massive regulatory issues in proving he was executor, proving the client died etc.

Customer money doesn't go on balance sheets anyway.

I own an investment firm -- does my balance sheet include my corporate assets or all my client assets?   Of course it includes only my actual assets --- I have no right to client assets ever, not if I die, not if I get hacked, go bankrupt or run the most incompetent firm in history.   My assets, my corporation's assets and my clients are separate.

What do you disagree with, the fact that the top bracket was really 91% or that it was oversimplified to not qualify the statement by assuming that the hypothetical taxpayer had no deductions and not separating where I said earnings versus adjusted earnings?

I didn't say bank - but I certainly would if my bank blocked me.  Organizations and public figures dislike bad publicity and conflict and can be swayed when they have done something wrong.  
At the very least it can help give pause to the next person.  
For example, my town collected $1.5 million for beach passes to a beach they manage while knowing the beach would be closed for an environmental issue-- so I showed up with 600 resident signatures and 4 news media and 20 protestors only 18 hours later at the town hall and they reversed the decision and offered refunds.   
Barry Greenfield, a selectman in Swampscott said he wanted to do police home inspections of firearms so I organized about 1000 phone calls and emails to complain to him and demand he apologize or step down, he apologized.
These things are pretty easy to do and there are activists who do this kind of thing on a massive scale often.  I'm not in that category - no time!

I definitely agree more with Vitalik on this issue.   I wrote a bit on my blog I think.
It's a very serious matter because it places us back into a trust situation.   With centralized mining we need to not only trust that miners will behave favorably -- a pretty good bet... we also need to trust that they won't have a government, lawsuit, nasty divorce, hack, theft, extortion, blackmail, bribery, threat, drug habit, crazy relative, but job with a knife or any of a hundred other issues which could affect them and therefor massively harm the whole system. 
I'd much rather thirst in the math than in people.

You are still not saying WHO makes this call and by what writen rule you suggest.
This basically is saying "someone" who is "good at business" can and should make the call... i.e. Have the right to ban, bar or revoke memberships.
Okay -- so who do we appoint?    Do we elect someone?  Does the board appoint them?
The surest way to fail is to not have a procedure or written rules and have a system relying on central authority without guidelines.   I trust Patrick completely to do this (I'd trust Gavin also, but don't think he'd want the job of the professional me,her ship screener) --- but so what, we need a system we can trust, not a person. 
 If, say for example, we write a rule giving the ED authority to ban any member he wants because it sounds scammy -- is that a good rule?
What if two EDs from now the person thinks all MLM is a scam but a legitimate one wants to join?   What if they think motivational speakers or Scientologists or Ron Paul fans or gold coin dealers or stockbrokers are scams? 
I have a crappy website for the 20 year old financial business I own....primarily because we need legal and compliance approvals for every chanfe we make and it's too time consuming.  What if someone thinks that website looks scammy?
This is why it's key to have actual procedures.   It's super easy to say "fix it" harder to say how.
I don't want these guys as a member --- but even less than that would I want a random, trust and gut instinct based system of central control.

Well it is the way it has been for every big innovation -- if they want to be the size of Google or Amazon or Apple then they will most likely do what every single one of those companies has done before them: go through several round of VC, then do an IPO, then get into the big leagues with mergers, PE etc.
Bitcoin can and may be massively disruptive but even if it grows to a trillion dollars in five years it's still just a drop in the bucket and companies like this might take the standard path.
Disruptive technologies are a big deal -- the Internet, the desk top PC etc. but it's a mistake for people to assume that disruptive tech will completely and totally obliterate all trace of the world before -- most typically the new tech integrates with the old and new models are formed.

As far as I know , steps to reduce the $150,000 have already been reduced.  The staff in DC is not a large one -- so dont get the idea that this is a cushy DC think tank style job.
There are tons of expenses the Foundation has -- I dont think there is tons of fat but I'd need access to the very latest numbers which are not out yet.
I definitely think that core development is and should be the priority.
When I attended the annual meeting in Amsterdam (where the comments from the minutes were taken) some people where worried that the foundation had too much money and wasn't spending it enough.   I think we had hovered in the $440-600 range then and many (including me) thought we'd see an increase before year end.
So right now-  where does that bring us?   To answer your question in the best way I'd say that TBF should be very cautious with resources for sure --- Patrick Murck only started very recently -- I think giving a little time for the new, re-focused plan to take shape and then looking at the numbers and data is key.
Hopefully that helps.

There are some people who just don't like Bitcoin and also may be annoying or whatever.
There are others who are extreme and are either paid trolls or unstable and even dangerous people.
Many (actually pretty much all) prominent people in Bitcoin and on this sub have been personally attacked including to the point of violent threats, harassment in their private life and harassment of their families.
Mods have been reluctant to ban trolls but the board has suffered for it.

Not at all -- it's about philosophy and beliefs on what the legitimate role of government is.
I believe that it is wrong to initiate force against another unless in defense and I believe that the only legitimate role of government is to protect life, liberty and property of others.

I'm very libertarian -- I had an exploratory committee for a Congressional run and have almost 50,000 people on my personal political Facebook page where I talk about freedom, libertarian ideals and free markets.
However....it worries me a bit when Bitcoin is considered to be "libertarian" money.  This can turn off some on the far right or left....it also requires additional hoops and explanations for people.   I'd rather not get into politics when discussing Bitcoin.
Ironically, an additional hurdle we have in the community is a bit of subtle class warfare:   Old miners and original holders sometimes thought of as more genuine and real (or more lucky by others) -- financial professionals and bankers being viewed with distrust etc.

Hi Matt, 
I think it's a combo of a few of the things you said.
It seems that smart Wall St. money knows that the inflows could be huge as public vehicles like SecondMarket and Winkelvoss ETF are available.   
Also, continued press coverage, a string of major announcements like Dish, MIT and others and the steady flow of major VC investments.  The army of passionate evangelists helps also.
(Apple allowed a Coinbase app?  Is this new info?)
We don't have an exact comparison in history because this is all new -- but it's hard to imagine so much VC and angel money going into something where the underlying tech is not worth a large amount.  In the case of Bitcoin the underlying tech is also a currency.   It's akin to what would have happened if we could have bought a piece of TCP/ IP or http.  
If all the news, all this investment and everything surrounding this technology becomes valued by the whole world at the same level, for example, that FB valued WhatsApp then we are looking at more than 100% of a price increase.
Personally I think the world will value Bitcoin far more than FB valued WhatsApp and in a fee short years the aggregate value of bitcoin will be worth more than Apple or FB or a small third world economy.

Its a MASSIVE drain on efficiency that does little to stop actual crime.
Basic economics -- whatever action is spent on compliance functions is time NOT spend on productive economic activity that provides goods and services to others.
If regulations like this are good-- why not have them for everything?  Certainly food is important--- without it we would die--  why not require an AML KYC check before purchase of food and monitor the social media and email of every person who works in a grocery store?
Fact is, these regs cost billions of dollars and lots a productivity-  they harm our international competitiveness and they do very little to prevent crime.
Do you think Bernie Maddoff followed the regs?  Nah -- he had a whole secret server to print statements and never even told the regulators about it when they did his audits.
Would someone committing fraud be stopped by the monitoring of his email?  Nope.  He'd simply get a new domain and never tell the regulators.

Sorry IMHO is a bad investment and bad ROI for TV ads at this stage no matter who funds it.
Talk to an ad exec. TV is for branding which is most effective with repetition for big consumer brands.
It's not effective to get people to take action such as sign up for a new service.
Also enough people don't even know about Bitcoin.
Much more effective would be an ad campaign on YouTube to get people to watch What is Bitcoin by weusecoins.com for example.

The other humble suggestion I'd make to those who disagree with this are to please defend the policies.
Do you have a legitimate reason you believe Satoshi should have been licensed?   Do you feel it serves the public good to not allow Bitcoin companies to keep profit in Bitcoin?
To say "I don't agree with the policies but I think we should support Lawsky writing them" is both a cop out and illogical.
In reality the reason those who support the regs support them is overwhelmingly not because they think the regs are good -- but because of fear - fear of Mr. Lawsky, fear of criminal charges, fear of the unknown.
We don't need to live in fear of violence.

Well, unlike the "systemic risk" the "too big to fail" had, there is little that such people could do to destabilize Bitcoin.    Even if Shady Joe managed to become $500 mm and then go under....as we've seen from Gox, Bitcoin still survives.
So I don't think that there is much such a fictitious group could do to harm Bitcoin.
If people want to invent Bitcoin derivatives, leverage Bitcoin 200 to 1 and put it in some new form of CDO which loans money in a housing bubble etc...let them -- that should be between the parties involved.
Unlike the banking collapse, those who do stupid and risky things or who have bad luck will go under and none of the rest of us will be forced to pay.

I would have been better off with no bailout and so would America.   I was extremely vocal against the bailout so it's crazy to lump me in with people who supported it.
What I mean by enforcement being a challenge is that lazy regulators often don't bother actually chasing real criminals and instead, too often, make new regs as a 'solution' to make up for weak enforcement.   Enron and Maddoff are two perfect examples.   In BOTH cases existing laws were broken and the regulators were too lazy to bother investigating / prosecuting.  In Maddoffs case there was a 17 page tip hand delivered and they still didn't bother.    What was their response to the cases? Make more new regulations....which Enron and Maddoff would never have followed anyway but which burden honest business people.

The law isn't against investing in start ups it's a matter of investing in private placements such as VC funds, hedge funds or private equity funds.

This is great and I like Kraken but people should also not consider this type of an audit to be in the same league as an audit by a major professional audit firm.
Even those audits can be wrong -- it's much easier to have human error or fraud with an audit like this.
Not trying to be negative but to put it in perspective --- this isn't a real audit by global business standards.

And you claim it's typical in Japanese bankruptcies for client assets to be seized to be given to the operating company?
Do you think the client Bitcoin is the property of the clients or the property of Gox?  If it's the property of Gox does this make the clients creditors or are they in a special new category where they have neither the rights of creditors nor their own property?
You are saying it's okay for companies to seize funds belonging to customers.
Do you have other examples where this occurs during bankruptcy?  Pawn shops?  Real estate?  Banks?  Investment firms?
So basically you are saying "screw the investors, it may be their money but I'm keeping it because I can hide behind legal procedures"
You are stealing 200,000 coins which belong to customers and expect to build a great reputation for an exchange from doing so.
Okay, good luck with that.
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:16:10
I seriously doubt it is the reason.
Bloomberg is a multi billion dollar company -- even if they invested $100mm into Andreessens funds that would be a small investment for them (although large size for a VC fund limited partner) --- of that fund investment only a portion of Andreessens capital will be invested in Bitcoin businesses.
So essentially, at best, Bloomberg owns maybe the equivalent of $500k to $1 mm worth of Bitcoin through Andreessen.   Whatever it is, it's a small amount.  Even if Bloomberg news directly targeted or pumped up a company like Coinbase its a tiny effect on the firms value.
Conversely, look at the revenue Bloomberg receives from major Wall St. firms like JP Morgan....it's hundreds of millions of dollars, same with advertisers....billions.
If Bloomberg was going to slant news for a tiny investment which has a PIECE invested in Bitcoin related investments, there would be 500 things ahead if it in line which have a far larger effect on Bloomberg the company.

Where do you get your information that that's "how it works" it NEVER works that way not for any bank, financial institution, hotel, pawn shop, law firm, escrow company, parking garage, airline or anyone else who temporarily takes your stuff. Ever.  Not in any legal jurisdiction on earth I know of.  
You say all creditors, "including depositors" - depositors are not creditors - only those loaned or owed money by the company from company assets are creditors.
For ages there has been a clear separation of customer property and business property -- to think that customers lose rights to their property just because a company goes bankrupt is ridiculous.  It doesn't work that way at all -- the assets are not and never were part of the balance sheet --- they don't just suddenly jump to the balance sheet.   
If this was the case people could risk losing their car if they parked in a garage which went bankrupt, losing their possessions if the apartment building they rented was in foreclosure etc.   Likewise if this was the way it worked anyone could simply seize customer money anytime for expansion or salaries by declaring bankruptcy.

In all seriousness I'll write an opinion letter from Atlantic Financial on the validity of Bitcoin as a legitimate asset class and balance sheet entry if that would help you.
We are not an accounting firm but have been an investment firm for 20 years and have extensive experience evaluating valuations and balance sheets.   
We also have no business ties to either company and are objective.
Bitcoin as an asset class in reflecting financial status is absolutely as legitimate as including a stock, real estate or commodity or currency or inventory.....all of which are, like Bitcoin, subject to fluctuations and speculation.

Saying "you people" is quite broad.  I was and still am adamantly opposed to government bailouts and the bonuses they gave to Wall St. execs.

@_date: 2014-07-14 03:28:36
I get it but I'd humbly suggest that you might want to tone down the attack tweets a little.  
Accusing someone of ill gotten cash is a harsh claim.   This is hardly unusual practice.   That doesn't make it right, but asking for transparency might be enough and saving the attacks for someone really horrible could be worthwhile.
Blogs and the web are full of sites who's only goal is to make money.   This of course also includes large scale mainstream media.   
CNN covered the Malaysia flight for three weeks not because it was more newsworthy than other events but because they manipulated enough viewers into watching it unfold like a soap opera drama...with just enough suspense to keep them tuned in and watching the ads.
For small blogs the journalistic integrity is even lower.  Unless they make a specific claim that they are independent, objective journalists we should assume that all news is suspect.
Sales of links, articles and interviews is very common.   About once a month a reporter or TV anchor calls me and tells me how fascinating I am and how much they've love to do a feature....by now I know to ask right away "how much?" -- it's usually $8000 or so snd if I didn't ask they'd keep going with the interview or setup of a camera crew, working to get me excited about how interesting they think I am (when in reality they could care less if I was selling mutual funds, Bitcoin, air conditioners or Dutch ovens).
The majority of the human interest stories about businesses are pay to play.  Virtually 100% of the "news" shown on airplane televisions is pay to play.  Entire magazines, most industry trades and others are pay to play.   In the investment businesses conferences for private equity and family offices have speakers who are not selected for aptitude but who pay to have a speaking slot.
I take articles with a grain of salt and will do so more -- the good value of your article is that you point out who is who.   But let's not act like these guys are the Mt. Gox hackers or something - they are trying to earn a living.  Simply encouraging transparency and honesty is probably enough.

The lifetime membership is not free.
We've given a number of free ones away....I don't anticipate suddenly charging or kicking people out....in a year or so we might send a nice note asking people to join the paid version.....hopefully they will find value in the association ....We can also offer some scholarship, gift programs and donate memberships.....as well as discounts to students and low income people etc.     But long term it won't always be free every year -- because then people who don't even care about Bitcoin could join....a
So we do want to do useful things that will eventually need membership donations.
One thing I can pledge is that this is meant to be a non profit and absolutely no money will be used for any kind of profitable thing.

Pretend you don't know what "bits" are or how much they are worth.
Using a search engine, find and tell me the value in dollars or even Bitcoin --- tell me how many steps it takes.
For example if you Google "how many bits in a bitcoin" the top five results are inconclusive and one of the main ones links to the wiki which has every possible unit except bits.

I totally agree -- typical people don't even know how to use Reddit -- they will not deal with something scary and confusing like BTC until it is WAY easier to use.
I think the combination of ease, adoption and Wall St is good -- they do go hand in hand, I'm counting VCs as part of "Wall St" and they will be key in funding and helping to build the companies which make it easier.
The current exchanges are not that great, correct.
@_date: 2014-02-19 18:52:11
Fraud is illegal, stealing money is illegal, making false statements or selling something under false pretense also illegal.
If someone says they will do something and does not then they can lose in court.   If they willfully defraud or steal that is criminal larceny -- it doesn't matter if they steal a painting bar of gold, $100,000 or a car or 100 Bitcoin -- it's still illegal.
No new regulation is needed to make this illegal.
Collecting those funds on the other hand is not going to be changed by a law either...Madoff victims also lost money and were unable to recover.

The BBC piece uses the "ISIS Bitcoin memo" as a basis for the report which is not ideal since that piece is most certainly fake.

What's with the negative comments?  People really think that someone should go to jail for a crime no other person in history has gone to jail for?
Charlie robbed no one.  He conned no one.  He stole from no one.
The accusation is that he didn't properly file paperwork.
The ONLY reason he was targeted is because he was so vocal and active in Bitcoin.  That's it.

For widespread adoption we need a MUCH larger market, at least 10x the current size, we need a bit more stability and we need more services and merchants and ancillary products coming online as well as more ease of use.

A 401k is different than an IRA -- and even within an IRA with an LLC I've had this conversation a lot and people are convinced it works fine....it doesn't.  Companies like Broad Financial will supply documents needed to set up the LLC and an IRA prototype....but that's a big difference from having something that is actually compliant.  To prove that the LLC owns the Bitcoins etc....it's a much more complex matter than people think.   Believe me, if there was a way I would offer them tomorrow and increase our assets by a billion dollars....Fidelity and Morgan Stanley etc. would beat me to it.

You Buttcoin guys are pathetic.  This is likely one of the same perpetual troll accounts.  I'm guessing that about 90% of Buttcoin is fueled by less than 5 people....at least one of whom is mentally unstable.
Do you have the courage to release your real handle?   Many of us here use our real names: Voorhies, Ver, the real Shrem, Andreas, Garzik etc.
Do you need to hide behind a double fake handle?
The whole idea of dedicating an entire sub is bizzare.   I don't think diamonds are a good investment and I am not a fan of most MLM but I can't fathom the personality that it takes to actually dedicate time and energy attacking something.
The attacks are more bizzare and desperate -- in some cases illegal.
If there are good people on Buttcoin they should carefully consider the company they keep.   The ones responsible for increasingly desperate attacks should be careful of crossing legal lines as it won't likely end well for you in court.

There is a difference between not being in favor of passing laws to make the IRSs job easier and ignoring taxes.
Why don't we install tracking chips on citizens, ban cash and Bitcoin and make mandatory monthly audits for every citizen?   That would make the job of the IRS much easier.    Better yet, we could have employers simply send 100% of paychecks to the IRS and then on April 15 citizens could petition to beg for their fair share rather than pay them.
I know the law law is indifferent to my personal stance on drugs, but to hear these regulators and panelists speak yesterday one would think that money laundering is some major scourge harming all humans....it's not.   It harms government and that's about it.

Because the extreme volatility is one of the main barriers to entry for some people – – and it is probably the biggest barrier of entry to widescale adoption by merchants – – because they cannot plan inventory and are concerned if the price volatility could move against them on thinly margined items that cost them money.

It would be nice if we could quantify this.  How many lives are saved by AML laws?  I am skeptical.
The price of putting someone like Charlie Shrem in a prison is a high one considering he harmed no one.  It does not serve the public good.
It seems contradictory to have people against the drug war be in favor of AML laws as drugs are what they are related to in almost all cases.
The fantasy of Jack Bauer catching a terrorist with AML laws is, just that, fantasy -- it's a great excuse for government to justify more control and, if we follow the money, we see the motivation -- people make a lot of money on the current AML scheme.
Keep in mind -- elimination of AML laws does not preclude police and investigatiors from doing police work and still tracking money, phone calls or whatever else they wish.

I think it's a massive stretch to say that people who died from drug cartels died of money laundering.
It's far less of a stretch to say that they died because of heavy handed drug laws which many people don't want which create the existence of cartels.
But this is beside the point -- crimes, in my opinion, are those with direct victims.  I think legal efforts should be focused on those crimes which violate someone else's life, liberty or property.
I have a simple philosophy:
"Don't harm or ask another to harm anyone who has harmed or threatened no other."
I can't supooort money laundering laws because they violate that principle.
@_date: 2014-12-29 21:28:58
1). I answered a very similar question in another reply.  Basically I would like it see regulation limited to protecting private property -- most of this already exists with existing laws: grand theft is illegal, breaking into someone's home is illegal, hacking a PC etc.
Most proposals for regulation such as Bitlicense go WAY beyond what is reasonable.
2). The most major complaints people have had have been surrounding transparency.  I think there exists more transparency than some people are aware -- but since this is brout up so often, clearly that is an area it can improve on.   Other areas are in maintaining a clear but also flexible mission.
3).  I think it's wise to cut back, simplify and allocate resources -- I do think that pushing back against regulation and educating regulators and lawmakers globally serve a useful role.   Going forward I'd like to see the foundation focus on the core development as announced -- but also, particularly in areas where it can be done with minimal cost, to serve as a recognized voice in education and dealing with regulators.

Yes, I could see a product like that coming along someday – – products like that do already exist for the stock market for example – –
There are investment products which do guarantee against volatility – but the major drawback is that investors have to pay a premium for that – the more volatile the underlying asset be at the stock market or Bitcoin, the more expensive the insurance is going to be.
More realistically – the problem of volatility will be reduced dramatically if Bitcoin grows and continues to grow to significant size
 – – and if it becomes a more major part of the overall financial system – – if it does this, by nature it will be harder for the price of Bitcoin to be moved by single whales or other large investors – – principles will be more sound in the volatility would be decreased – – also as the market grows and more traders enter it there will be less of a spread and less volatility because more traders would be taking advantages of tiny price movements and this, also in turn adds to the stability

Ryan - no need to throw mud.  Just ask simple questions.
No absolutely positively I did not know that there were cold storage losses.   They gave no indication of that whatsoever.
Based on how broken they were and lack of communication I assumed that there might have been some loss/ hack/ theft maybe 10k coins or something (which is a total guess).   There was never, ever any indication at all that there was a cold storage loss or that massive coins were lost.
I thought this was pretty clear in the OP.
As far as mentioning the plan of con indicating to clients what the status of coins was -- yes, that's what we would have done if we took over....but all of this was based on the blew of that Gox had the coins.
If we proceeded into deeper discussions  --- even before your leaked docs -- the FIRST thing we would have done is flown to Japan with a couple security experts and had them verify the keys in no uncertain manner.   There is absolutely no way we would have talked to them at all or proceeded if we thought that any really significant peace of cold storage was gone.

1) take an old junk laptop 
2) go to bitcoinpaperwallets.com and download the pages
3) take the computer offline and never go online again
4) print a mess of wallets - make two copies of every wallet
5) use the feature called BIP 38 --- this allows a password - make sure you have the password copied in a safe place 
Put the wallets in two separate locations such as a bank box and a safe -- you can even give to a freind or relative as long as the password is kept separate.
That's it -- you can then put the public addresses in a list (which doesn't need to be secure) watch them online and load money to them.

But you are calling for violence to be used.  When you ask for new laws which are enforced by violence you are a party to that violence.

Of course I was aware there were alternative plans and aware of OkCoin - when someone referenced the rehab plan I thought it was a different plan they were referring to.
When I say only option I mean that it's either get the coins return or liquidate.
If you support OkCoin - fine -- I could care less as long as the customer coins are returned.
As I've said before I think all the plans are not ideal, I specifically said that SaveGox wasn't perfect and I also said I don't even think the customer coins belong in bankruptcy at all.
My excuse to not providing the legal info is the same as before -- I have a life outside of Reddit and simply don't have the time right now....also the case is moving quickly so it's becoming less relevant.

Read above it --- I'm saying if Bitcoin was regulated the way FINRA is then this would apply.
So -- to apply the analogy to our current world.....everyone who works for a company like Coinbase, Bitpay, an exchange, startup, Etherium etc. would all have to have a "BitLicense". (I believe this specific term has been used by regulators).    Officers of non-profits probably would not have to be registered unless they also worked for a Bitcoin related company (which most of them do)
It doesn't matter that it's not centralized....the concept of "financial advice" or "selling pieces of a business" are not centralized either.
A regulation could be made which said that every Bitcoin / altcoin company and professional had to register and that would be that.

For the financials I don't feel comfortable releasing them and I'm not authorized to -- 
For the valuation -- we wouldn't have done the buyout as nice guys but to safe the company and hopefully also make a profit.
What it might have looked like is something like, we take the company over, Mark and the other shareholder retain 20% or something.   We fix it and make it worth a billion, Mark is then rich, everyone wins, us, him, shareholder, customers.

Threat of violence.   Not sure why you are not following.   If you keep saying "no" to the state (which is a peaceful act) they will eventually force you to do something with violence (which is not a peaceful act).
All laws, rules and regulations -- no matter how well meaning or benign sounding are, at the end of the day, enforced by violence.
That is THE unique and defining characteristic of the state -- it's what makes it's orders/ decrees different from every other person or group....the ability to do violence.
If a church comes to your door and says they don't like your definition of marriage or that you have a forbidden plant or if a junk food fan comes to your door and complains about your raw milk or a customer doesn't like your money transmission method etc etc.....none of those people or groups can legally do violence to you.     The State and only the state can handcuff you, cage you, size your assets and hurt you if you resist.   It is their pure and unique defining characteristic.
What is the difference between a landlord or neighbor sizing your assets versus the government? What enables the government to do so?  Why not simply say "nah"?   The difference is the ability of the state to back it up with violence.  This is why when assets are seized it's done by armed people who will bark "stand over there" while they take your stuff.  It's not a suggestion like it would be if I came with no uniform and told you to stand somewhere.
What's the difference between Lawsky saying Bitcoin businesses should do XYZ and Gavin Andreessen (who knows a hell of a lot more about Bitcoin than Lawsky) saying so?    With Gavin it's voluntary --- with Lawsky it's backed by force....if you don't follow what he says he does violence to you.  If you don't think that getting arrested and handcuffed against your will is violence then talk to someone who has been. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 02:25:08
They "just seize your assets" -- that's an act of violence because they can only do so due to their ability to harm us.  Anyone else takes out assets we can fight it.
The entire process you describe is done under threat -- threats of violence are a form of violence. 
If I pull a Rosa Parks and say "I refuse" -- if I rip up your letter, your paper giving me a fine, if I bar my door from your thugs coming to "just" seize my assets -- if I PEACEFULLY resist your goons will do violence on me-- they will handcuff me, throw me in jail and if I resist they might mace, tase or shoot me.
By the way, no, we are NOT a democracy, we are a Constitutional republic with a set of rights FIRST.

I understand the advantages of these models for creators and companies.  My own content is almost all Creative Commons licensed for example.
But the argument of whether something is better for a creator is irrelevant if it's not voluntary.
People should be free to make decisions others may think is bad.  Artists do this often.  There are many artists who limit the way things are performed etc.  They should have this right.
Creation of intellectual property still creates property and should be subject to property rights.  No one should be able to use your property in any manner unless you choose to allow it.

If I have time I'll write something up specifically about this-- the ownership is NOT the bank.
I own an investment firm --- in 2008 we had a business deal go badly and a company stuck us with $600,000 in costs.
At the time we managed about $700 million in customer assets.

Absolutely not in any way, shape or form.
It's not just because we are highly regulated -- even consignment shops, car mechanics and other businesses must separate customer assets from their own.

And you think AML is the ONLY thing the regulators are considering?
Did you watch the hearings?   They were even talking about mining regulation.
MANY people -- some within our own industry are calling for Bitcoin to be regulated EXACTLY like other financial sectors such as brokerages and banks.
This is totally relevant and AML/ KYC is very closely intertwined with securities regulation and the above examples.
If I knew more about what life is like for a medical doctor I could have just as easily written a post titled "Thing you like regulation?  Here's what a day in the life of a medical doctor is like"  and listed some of the many regulations they must comply with and it also would have been completely relevant.

I'm very familiar with it.
The original accusation was "failure to file a suspicious activity report".
The accusation is that Charlie didn't sell Bitcoin but facilitated selling Bitcoin through another party to yet another party (BTCKing) which was then sent to yet another set of people (BTCKings customers) which they are then alleged to have used on yet another party's site (Silk Road) and, because it's Silk Road it's highly likely that Bitcoin ultimately ended up being used for things like forbidden plants which are legal in several states and which millions of Americans think should be legal.
That's the accusation.
It is total and complete nonsense.  At the end of the day Charlie was arrested for ONE and only one reason: his prominence in the Bitcoin space.  Never in 22 years as a licensed and registered financial professional have I seen any case even close to this in terms of overreaction and blatant singling out.   Typically failure to file an SAR report can result in a warning, an audit, maybe a fine.
Charlie was used as a marketing show so Ben Lawsky could get headlines and throw the respondents in his hearing onto the defensive.   Plain and simple.

Boards are governed by bylaws -- it's also a bit tedious to expect the board level to police these types of actions.
Bobby Lee for example is a board member, like all board members he is super busy....in his case running an exchange in China, a complex country.
We are asking him and the others to "hey, look at this and next meeting vote them out, they are scammers". But before the board could even do that they'd need to vote on a change in the bylaws to even allow such a vote.
This isn't a unique problem to the Bitcoin Foundation but to any board.
This might be the best way to handle it but I suspect there are better methods and governance methods.

You brush over the examples like saying that if Disney simply took scripts without compensation of the artists that no one would submit scripts to them anymore.   First off, they wouldn't need to -- Disney could simply take whatever script they wanted whether it was submitted or not.   
To your question of whether the size of the company matters -- no, it doesn't --- I use Fox or Disney as examples because given their huge size they'd be eminently capable of exploiting this if artists did not have legal protection of their creations.

I honestly did not understand your question the word "fucking" has many meanings.   I thought you meant it as in "the border is littered with all these fucking dead bodies" and thought you were alluding to the drug war or something like other posts.
So, for your question:  does having sex with a dead body violate someone else rights?   No, not in and of itself.   We'd need to determine who controls or owns that body (this is partly based on the wishes of the deceased like other property) -- the morgue, the family / loved ones of the deceased etc.  If all people involved agreed and it was a voluntary and peaceful act then, I think it's completely creepy and disgusting but not a violation of someone's life liberty or property.
In reality this is very unlikely to occur - most people who have control over a dead body are loved ones and it is unlikely they would agree to such an event.   
This is also made more complex by the very unusual ownership issues surrounding a dead body -- it is not a piece of property like any other and the deceased should have the right to determine how thier body is disposed of in thier will or other documents.
Living people have property and control of thier own living body -- they own themselves.  When they die all property goes into a process by which it is legally transferred to others based on the wishes of the deceased.  If someone specifies that they would like to be cremated or whatever then that should be honored.
So the core of your question I guess is whether laws which criminalize sex with dead bodies are just laws.  I suppose not - provided the wishes of the deceased were followed etc.   I would not spend time or effort fighting this law as there are many more unjust laws with far larger impact.

I have no financial interest in SaveGox whatsoever -- no, I'm not worried about an open market dump --- even an incompetent liquidator would know better than to do so.
My "angle" is that I firmly and strongly believe that customer assets belong to customers, period-- I do not believe they belong to the corporation and should not even be a part of the bankruptcy -- they should have been treated like customer property and serrated and returned.   Since the trustee doesn't seem to value Bitcoin this way then the SaveGox plan is the best remaining option to accomplish what is fair to the customers.

I've been and am involved in many legitimate financial institutions.
I take compliance seriously and have never had a regulatory issue or compliance violation, complaint, action or failed audit and neither has anyone I have supervised.
However I can still disagree with the premise of the law while complying with it.  I do not believe that the current AML laws serve the public good.

A few examples:
- Susan saves BTC for a few years and because of savings is able to finally quit her job at the gas station and take a year to finish her training as an architect 
- Abasi in Kenya is below global poverty standards, he is part of the 5 billion 'unbanked' he must pay a premium for food because he can only afford to buy it in small daily quantities ....by saving in BTC he does not need a bank account and also is able to buy an entire months worth of rice rather than the daily supply, saving him 70% of the cost -- he uses that saved money to buy some new tools and some goods he can sell at a profit....if he can repeat this cycle he can exit poverty.....without savings, Abasi is much more subject to the whims of fate and has far fewer options: he cannot afford the bus ticket to the next town which his cousin knows of a higher paying job etc etc.
- Michael is an insurance salesman and he saves BTC so he can buy his own three unit apartment building and move out of the apartment he rents,  the other two units cover his mortgage, allowing him to save even more and he is able to buy another apartment unit two years later.....20 years down the road, Michael owns 15 apartment buildings and employs three people to maintain them
- Khalid from Dubai has saved from his family trading and import company for 10 years...he now has enough that he can comfortably take the big risk to start a $100 mm R&amp;D center which employs 100 people
Savings allows people more options.    Options allow for economic growth.

For sure -- I mention this in another question.   There are well meaning regulators who genuinely want to protect consumers and protect themselves from being seen as having failed people -- they want to avoid major scams, Mt Gox style events and theft etc.  
These regulators can be reasoned with.
There is another type of regulator who can't be reasoned with: they are ambition driven, corrupt, headline seeking political opportunists who care little about the public or consumer protection and even less about innovation and job creation.  Ben Lawsky is in this category...although his profound lack of knowledge shows stunning lack of understanding of the tech as well.

I'm definitely not okay with scam businesses funding the foundation. A fair and organized system should be in place to reject members.  We can't simply say "if they are a scam we reject" because it should be more defined than that and avoid abuse (such as if someone accused a competitor of being a scam) --- this is a relatively easy matter to deal with, organizations reject members all the time.  The solution doesn't necisarily need to be complex or decentralized...just fair, open and transparent in a way that avoids abuse potential.

There is a misconception that the whole plan is some effort consisting entirely of making Gox rise from the ashes -- no wonder people don't like the idea.
I'm merely pointing out that the 200,000 coin issue is not understood.

If you buy slaves (even to free them) you are

2) furthering a market for slaves and encouraging more slavery
3) giving money to scumbags who will do more evil
The end (that you free them) doesn't justify the means.... You don't buy slaves and you don't reward scumbag slavers for their actions.

You are basing everything under the assumption that 1) your documents are authentic and completely accurate and 2) Gox is logical and sensible and operates like a regular business.
We know that  is not the case.    Assuming your docs are real and accurate is it that much of a stretch that Gox would neglect to send them to someone they were talking with?   I assumed they had no business plan and sure as heck didn't expect any "crisis doc" because they gave no indication there was a crisis of this nature.   I thought it was simply a tech and management problem.

The recent IRS notice said that you don't need to file an FBAR for BITCOIN accounts.  As in, a wallet, or Bitcoin holdings.
No kidding.
YOU STILL DO NEED TO FILE an FBAR for foreign investment accounts -- this includes Mt. Gox, Bitstamp etc.
The IRS clearly doesn't have even a most basic fundamental understanding of Bitcoin and have made a confusing announcement --- it is especially bad that this announcement has gotten traction right after Tyson Cross and others brought up the need for an FBAR to be filed.
Read the notices, read the document, read the fine print.
Bitcoin and an exchange account are two different things.
Unless you have something from the IRS that SPECIFICALLY states that Bitcoin exchange accounts like Gox are NOT considered financial accounts, then assume they are, as they seem to meet the definition.

My guess is that they are planning to go big or go home and are targeting millions of customers.
Once they reach that they will have no problem finding ways to make money.
People once thought Google would never make money ("it's a search ending/ search is free") and Facebook went years when the ad revenue was WAY less than burn rate on costs.
Some on this sub have expressed worry over the free model.  In mind of itself is not a concern.   If someone really serious with serious backers looked at all successful consumer web and tech companies they'd see this model often.

It's expensive and a lot of work to put on conferences.
Some are more -- the American Banker Digital Currency Conference last month was ONE day at $800.
Typical investment conferences are much more.   Superreturn Private Equity Conference is $5000 (not a typo)
No one should criticize conference costs unless they've tried it.
I'm hosting a conference -- the Dubai Bitcoin Conference and my only financial aim is to not actually lose money.   The folks at Inside Bitcoins do this for a living and I think they do a great job.
For those on a budget there are Meetups and some great low cost conferences like Coins in the Kingdom which MK Lords and Jason King are hosting which I believe is only $99 or something and has a great room discount also.

1) did you listen to the speech where I specifically said "this is not as serious as much more major issues like the civil rights movement - however we can take a page from their book"
2) it's perfectly valid to take lessons from important people in history -- one can be for peaceful civil disobedience and bring up the names of MLK, Gahdni or Rosa Parks -- it doesn't mean that it's a contest or comparison or to say that our struggle is as important

It almost never makes sense to do early withdrawals from 401k plans.  
You get a tax penalty 
AND the withdrawals are also taxed as ordinary income 
AND you lose your tax deffered status 
AND you no longer have that nest egg for retirement.
With Bitcoin you also risk losing every single penny you invest.
Im a huge Bitcoin bull but it's not advisable.
Only invest in Bitcoin what you can afford to lose.

If someone wants to invest in "Shady Joes Bitcoin Emporium" or "Mt. Gox Part Duex" that is their right.  They take their risks and we don't bail out them or the exchange if it goes under.
If someone lies about what they offer or how the business is run then that is fraud with legal recourse.

Against my better judgement and under the assumption that you are somehow actually this mistaken and not purposely trolling I'll respond again:
I'm not talking about the lost coins, I'm talking about the 200,000 coins which remain.  Gox can quote the text above and claim it has no responsibility for the coins --- this is still subject to the other terms and the law.
But even if they somehow absolved responsibility of this they STILL have responsibility to honor the holding of the remaining 200,000 coins on behalf of members in member accounts and allow access to them.
They cannot simply convert 20% of client funds into a mandatory experimental venture capital fund regardless of how badly they want to any more than Mark could have seized 20% of client funds for expansion last year.

Japan is a place where if your wallet is stolen the police will actually investigate.   If someone commits an armed robbery of $1000 they will do fingerprinting, DNA tests and investigate for 3 years if need be.....yet here we have a $500 million theft and barely any real investigation.

It means that roughly 25% of the coins remain -- so if you had 1000 coins at Gox you'd get 250 coins, if you had 10 coins you'd get 2.5 coins.
You'd also get equity in addition to your share of those 200,000 coins.

I'm not comfortable disclosing personal holdings other than that I am overweighted and wish it was more and wish I was earlier!
Bitcoin is still experimental and risky -- we who invest could indeed LOSE EVERY PENNY - this is a fact.  In new, uncharted territory anything can happen.
I believe Bitcoin will increase a great deal and it is good for people who have liquid assets they can afford to lose.
For your parents it depends on their net worth, risk tolerance and understanding of Bitcoin and what other types of investments they have made -- VC, stocks, mutual funds etc.
I don't subscribe to common investment risk methodology which weights risk relative to age....more important is the investment experience, tolerance and what the money is for (funds held by an 80 year old for benefit of a 10 year old grandchild have a longer term and higher risk tolerance for example) -- but nevertheless, you described them as "aging" and that is a bit of a red flag as it increases the chance they may not understand this.   For all I know your father could be Sumner Redstone or Carl Icahn so it's all relative.
As an investment advisor I can't recommend this to someone unless they have a solid understanding of Bitcoin and can afford to lose that money -- especially if past investments consist of CDs or mutual funds.  Bitcoin by nature is much more risky.
In addition to the experimental risk there is also systemic risk of loss of coins, hacking of wallets or exchanges etc.  Best practices cold storage using ubuntu and paper wallets with m and n keys are a challenge even for techno geeks.   So even if Bitcoin goes up, people still face severe risk from hacks, phishing attempts and theft.
I believe in this technology and am dedicating every hour and every dollar I can to it but I could very well lose massively by doing so.
Having said all this -- it's impossible to make broad judgements without a proper financial plan but I am betting advisors, if this works, will be allocating Bitcoin along the lines of gold or managed futures etc....maybe a few percent of a portfolio.

Thank you – – I bought my first stock when I was 12 years old --it was Atari – – which you may even be familiar with, the videogame company 
It was eventually acquired by Warner Brothers  which later became Warner Communications and Time Warner which bought AOL and the Turner companies eventually – – the next stock which I bought was Ma Bell which was later known as AT&amp;T and split into several different companies – – I ended up selling the proceeds for that in buying myself a Texas Instruments 99 4a personal computer.
So, my advice is that you can definitely invest and learn and have fun at the young age – – I would recommend joining a stock market club, stockpicking club, or even investing real money on your own by maybe buying a share of the stock or something like that – – it’s a little bit harder today than it used to be but thanks to the Internet there are many new ways to emulate trading and learn about it there also a lot of good books.
One key thing to remember is that stock market investing is buying a piece of a business – – just like buying a piece of your local pizza parlor or auto mechanic company – – you own a piece of that business and your ultimate profits will depend on how well that business does.
The other piece of advice I would give to young person is to think globally and think about the world as a whole – – assuming you are American – – think about travel and try to do a summer abroad or something like that we are in a global world now – – if you’re outside the US already been please come here to America and visit us if possible.

I think you've been misinformed about what Dubai is like.

Yes, unfortunately, like many countries in the world they have gay rights laws similar to the was the US was a fee decades ago -- they are making progress in this area and certainly we would welcome gay people to attend the conference as well as people of any economic background.
It's easy to criticize other countries...fact is there are many problems all over the world.   My own country bombs and kills people and places more of it's citizens in prison than any other.

Circle is a great onramp and makes it easy for people to buy Bitcoin.
You can still control your keys by instantly moving them to another wallet.
There are a couple things to note:   1) there are a whole mess of people who are just learning Bitcoin and don't understand wallets and even if they did simply won't go through what to them is a lot of hassle and work ---  I met an IT guy who told me his bank customers had less than 5% who used two facto
2). This is not Mark Karpeles with his php card game trading engine -- this is a serious, stable, solid company with transparent team, capital and solid systems --- many if the risks of having them have your keys are reduced and in some ways better off for some people with Circle --- some risk still remains of course
Overall I actually tell newbies to keep coins at Circle or Coinbase rather than mess with wallets until they learn what they are doing or the amount becomes large

The reason I posted this sample list is exactly to address the misconception that regulations relate only to crimes with victims.
The regulation in other areas ....like finance....the government has entered is not close to smart...it's overly restrictive.     
Look at the above list of examples and multiply it by 2000 and you have an idea of the regs governing finance and banks.....that would be terrible for Bitcoin and would stop a lot of innovation and either Bitcoin would die or it would be completely controlled by a tiny number of huge players who can afford the compliance costs.

I believe he said they had fiat in their corporate accounts about six or eight months  before the collapse -- I hope no one took that as a permanent  opinion meaning Gox was safe forever -- even accounting firms update audits annually and this was not presented as an audit.
There was a separate issue when people on IRC asked Mark K to move 424,424 coins to prove he controlled them -- as far as I know Roger wasn't part of that and didn't vouch for Bitcoin holdings....certainly not later on.   I don't know of anything Roger did or said which was not accurate.
It seems that anyone who knows who Roger is and following his opinion is probably involved enough in the community that they would have other means to evaluate Gox....especially at the end of last year as problems became worse.
Let's also remember that Gox was not transparent and honest with the community and clients.
I talked to Mark K just days before the leaked memo and he gave no indication there was any problem - unless someone says they did an audit or says something incorrect we should encourage people in the community to communicate and say what they learn or think and the potential investors can carefully make decisions accordingly.  Otherwise some may be less likely to become involved.

That works also, but I was really thinking actual delivery -- the trend with Trunk Club and other items is to deliver things then let people pay.
For merchants they benefit for the same reason COD did for so long:  people love getting packages and are very likely to buy at delivery.

Sometimes political people, especially in DC, can be well-meaning but sucked into the DC culture of encouraging more laws and regs.  We should fight this urge and definitely not engage any lobbyist who plays this game.

Your options are 1) get your share of the 200,000 coins back now AND some equity AND your share if an investigation leads to recover 
Or 
2) get some of your share of the 200,000 coins someday when the settlement is done, no equity and no investigation

Godwins Law is annoying and far over cited.
In an example like this it is perfectly valid and reasonable to ask this question (which isn't necessarily making a "comparison to Nazis" or calling someone a Nazi because of their views)
Not sure if people who pull out the "gotcha! Godwins Law!" Card are aware of it but the Nazis and Hitler were a major event in history.
It is completely and totally reasonable to make a counter argument when someone makes a claim to point out that, in and of itself, the claim would apply under the Nazis as well.

I can't explain it because I don't yet see that value proposition.  All I see so far is a cool idea for decentralized, secure storage.  I might be wrong for sure -- I have spent much time on it....just looking at your website video etc.  
It certainly doesn't mean that's all there is to the business -- just maybe it's worth articulating.
It's going back to venture investing basics:
Here is the consumer need people have pain on and want solved or here is the new need we create 
Here's how we solve it
Here's why we are the best to solve it/ why it will work
Here's the size of the market and what piece of the market we will capture or what new market we will create 
Here's how we'll make money
Here's what percentage of the business we are offering in exchange for X which gives a market value of Y based on....
It seems like most of the presentation is on vague points on items 1 and 3 -- some smart people I like seem to like your plan so that's why I'm taking the time.  IMHO the value proposition should be more clear.

The assets are not the company's they are the clients -- there is a difference.
Not sure what investment firm or bank you have worked with (if any) but it is NEVER, EVER acceptable to take client funds for the operational business.
Client assets should NOT be part of bankruptcy -- client assets and corporate assets are two separate things.
Where in the Gox TOS does it state that client funds can be used for business operations???
Even if it said this, which is doesn't, wouldn't it be prudent to run something with better standards than, oh, I dunno, the worst disaster ever to occur in Bitcoin?
You honestly think it's acceptable for exchanges to steal client funds so they can pay for new employees, legal fees and other costs?  Seriously?   So if tomorrow Coinbase says 20% of client funds are theirs for a new China expansion, that's cool with you?   How about if Bitstamp loses 80% of it's coins in what it claims is a "leak in the cold wallet caused by invisible transaction malleability" -- okay with you if the following announcement is "okay we are also stealing the remaining 20% and keeping them for ourselves".
I'm really genuinely curious what sort of system or rules you have for when exactly it is okay for exchanges to steal client funds for the use of executives.  Is this a system you have or is it just pulled together willy nilly on a one off basis?

The old school financial world is the same way.

&lt;&lt;You argued not that FINRA is specifically too intrusive, but for the status quo of no regulation. I would consider a compromise, but you presented your argument in the framework that regulation in general is bad. And that is nonsensical, irrational, and unsupportable.
Well regulation of Bitcoin would be bad....we already have significant laws in place about fraud, theft, hacking etc.  I don't think new tech warrants a new law unless it creates a new crime with a clear victim.
I don't think we end up with less money laundering as a result of regulations in any meaningful way.
&lt;&lt;Again, I disagree but I don't want to make this about money laundering. I don't particularly care to discuss that.
Laundering is a key point, maybe THE key point used in the NY hearings to justify regulation.
&lt;&lt;&lt;Certainly nothing close to worth the massive harm done by regulations.
Massive harm. Hah.
Take just one example: the requirement for firms to keep and retain email.
Fantastic. A great regulation.
How much fraud and theft does this stop?
&lt;&lt;Lots. It raises the barrier to entry.
How though?   Think about it, a person committing fraud is simply not going to use that email system.
Would a Bernie Maddoff comply with such a thing? Of course not, he'd 
have a secret email he never told regulators about.


-- it's just an example-- ANY person committing fraud is simply going to ignore this regulation....meaning that 99.99% of the emails the regulators retain and review are from honest people.   The only one who would slip through is a criminal dumb enough to do illegal activity via email he KNOWS is being monitored....that's a very tiny number and anyone that dumb would likely be caught by other means.    So we have this massive regulatory apparatus in place to monitor email-- tons of expense, likely almost no useful result.
&lt;&lt;This is bad logic. To counteract the argument for email retention, you need to show that it is overall generally ineffective (not ineffective in one instance) or that overall the costs outweigh the benefits. You don't attempt that.
It's impossible to do that unless we had exact numbers....but I can think of a very small number of cases where email is used as a law enforcement tool but know for sure of the massive burden....keep in mind this is just one of thousands of regs used as an example.
&lt;&lt;Yet, this one simple regulation costs hundreds of millions of dollars-- special servers that prevent data from being erased, entire companies which specialize in email compliance etc etc
&lt;&lt;That's not a net economic cost or inefficiency. It creates other industries, technologies, specializations. One could say its a benefit of regulation.
But not an economic productive activity.   Government could require that citizens move bricks from one side of the road to another and back all day but it doesn't create real economic growth -- only providing goods and services people want does
&lt;&lt;&lt;Why does the client have your personal email? Why are you using them on the same machine or device? That is not honest and/or well meaning.
See?  You are thinking like a regulator.   Quick to ruin someone's life, reputation and career assuming they are not honest and well meaning.  My own brother is a client for example.   Also, what if someone had your personal email from before they became a client,  what if they are your FB friend?  (Not allowed by most firms) -- what if you serve in a board together and they have your personal email from that or a common interest email list or a friend or they looked it up etc etc?   Tons of legitimate reasons and this happens all the time.
&lt;&lt;We don't end up with a "better situation for all" we end up with tons of pain and burden on the honest and regulations which are ignored by the dishonest.
&lt;&lt;I disagree. We end up with a well ordered society.
It's worth asking where this stops.  At what point is it too much?
&lt;&lt;In some ways, regulations actually INCREASE crime.
Eh, now you're equivocating— ie making the topic "crime" as a statutory definition as opposed to crime as bad acts. Society's already had this one out; bad acts are bad, but yes, we do create statutory violations because of the risks of evolving into bad acts.
It's like you're questioning the entire judicial precent of malum in se / malum prohibitum. And that goes nowhere.
&lt;&lt;the foreign beneficiary letter scam is almost never prosecuted....because the perpetrators don't play by the rules.
&lt;&lt;Eh, that's more because of jurisdictional inefficiencies. They're not in fact subject to the rules, or the same set of rules. If anything, you just made an argument for why we should lock down the internet and any international communication (anything which crosses jurisdictions) over it should be heavily scrutinized.
No-- that scam can be and is done from our own soil to people on our own soil....just like many other scams, lottery scams, advance fee, penny stock fraud, fraudulent LLCs etc etc....I've seen these things a hundred times -- when clients have a relative or friend who is a victim I've often been the first call "Bruce, auntie bought something called an Oil and Gas guaranteed option, she can't get ahold of the salesman, can you look into it?"  I've reported these things to regulators many times we once even hired a private investigator and delivered an entire package much like the tip the Maddoff whistleblower made
and they are always completely ignored ....because criminals don't follow the laws and regulators are not well equipped to deal with people who don't follow their regs

I don't think the risk of people returning items to net a premium is a big risk.
Think of high end dresses and jewelry....there is always a chance someone will buy it, wear it once or a big party, then return it.
When I started my career as a stockbroker in the early 1990s, customers had FIVE BUSINESS DAYS to pay for a trade.   So they could call up, buy 1000 shares of EMC at 17 and if it went to 23 in a week, they come in and pay, if it went down to 12 they could walk and not pay.    Despite that it almost NEVER happened .... Regular people don't like being scummy con artists and they are not that good at it....they generally won't go to the trouble to do something like pick out a new fridge.   Con artists will try to scam no matter what.

In my opinion they are not the same -- we could only say so if the money laundering was definitely used in a crime.   This is what the law defines money laundering as but is not the case in reality.  
In reality there are a mountain of regs which make money laundering ITSELF the crime -- prosecutors do not care at all if any crime with a real victim was actually committed -- they can, have and will prosecute people who have harmed no other and were involved in harming no other.
The drug mule example isn't a great one for me because I think drugs should be legal also.  By the way, a huge amount of the money laundering is drug related.

They may have not known --- also, they said "cancelled" flight.....I guess in a way it was canceled, by the fact that the government didn't let him fly.
It would have certainly made an interesting session if they announced it and people could have discussed it there....but with limited info and it being a legal matter that would be a tough call.
If I was conference organizer I would never lie to the participants but if I knew the truth I would have not likely said so either for confidentiality....maybe just said "not possible for him to make it."

There are a few of these comments on the last few posts about Dubai Bitcoin Conference so I'll address.   I don't have a ton of time for a long debate on this and I've had the debate 50 times already.
But in summary:  there are many misconceptions about the region.  People who get info from media rather than first hand accounts should be cautious of the reliability of the source.  Almost always, these comments come from people who have never been there and really don't know what they are talking about.
As far as "slaves" - if you use any reasonable definition of that word these statements are not accurate.   There are extremely low paid workers.  There were cases a decade ago and intermittently from time to time of worker rights abuses such as bad living conditions etc.  But slaves?  Even at the worst cases that's an extreme claim.  There are potentially isolated incidents of worker abuse but not two million people.
The people who work for low wages do so voluntarily because they want to.  The jobs are hard but they give the workers a better life, sometimes better jobs.

It's not wrong legally it's just not possible in practical application for regular investors....to do this is very expensive and a major red flag for auditors.   
People have wanted to do this for a long time...owning real estate etc. and the main practical problem is that no recognized custodian will handle those assets and auditors to audit the holdings will be expensive.
So, it can be done but I've never seen it effective for anyone other than the very wealthiest people with large balances of $10 mm plus or so.

The right if someone to "use their own property" stops when in harms another.  That includes acts of violence or theft.
Theft for intellectual property is not solely defined by whether it's use deprives the owner but by what the owners wishes are.  It is his or her creation and labor, and his or her decision.

Conspiracy would never have held water -- it comes down to failure to file SAR and "operating unlicensed" which is what he pled guilty to -- well he went to Lawsky's office every week informing them of what he was doing and asking if he needed a license....they didn't have a concept of a Bitlicense until much later.
As soon as the bureaucrats got around to deciding that Bitcoin counted as "money transmission" Shrem shut the doors without even being asked to.

It wasn't exactly me, it was Circle --- but I facilitated it.
Heres what happened:  Last year I went to UAE and went to the first place to accept Bitcoin:  Pizza Guys restaurant.
I asked the owner, Rami, why he accepted this crazy nerd money.  He replied "Lots of reasons, but one is that I've seen destruction in the world and if we can somehow reduce the money that is controlled by governments, we might have more peace in our world."
So this year when I hosted the Dubai Bitcoin Conference I called up Rami again and said "Cmon down, we are buying pizza for 100 people."  Circle stepped up and paid for it.
Thats one of the better purchases.

I dont get too detailed about my personal holdings for a lot of reasons including privacy and security but I'll do my best.
(Side note:  I always love Trace Mayer's line  when someone asked him about his Bitcoin "I'm not saying I own any, but if I did I wouldnt tell")
My net worth depends on the value of my investment firm and consulting practice --- both of which I'm also moving into Bitcoin focus.
As far as actual BTC holdings, I entered the space later than most but have bought consistently and definitely have an over-weighting in Bitcoin.  Lets say over 20%.
I dont have a mining investment now but have looked at it quite a bit.  For investments I've worked on some seed stage such as ChangeTip and a couple others which are not ready to announce.
The board member position is not compensated.
I could be influenced to policy positions based on my investments in Bitcoin and related companies.  I have a very solid financial interest in seeing Bitcoin suceed.

Are you am attorney or regulator or FINRA member?
I was a Registered Rep, stockbroker / financial advisor and General Securities Principle - supervisor for nearly 20 years....I've held the Series 7, Series 24, Series 65, 66, and 33 licenses,  Uniform Investment Advisor Law Exam and worked at a major Wall St. firm, started my own firm, been a Registered Investment Advisor and done hundreds of hours of continuing education, met with regulators many times, dealt with compliance officers hundreds of times, overseas audits over a dozen times, been a witness in securities cases and done over $4 billion in transactions.
That's where my information comes from.   Where does your info come from?  Wikipedia?
If you think that FINRA is some kind of optional club for people and that the only penalty for breaking its rules is internal you are seriously mistaken.   If you want to engage in business covered by FINRA you MUST register and become a member or you can go to jail.  If you are a member and you violate rules you can go to jail.

Increased prince doesn't increase volatility it DECREASES it.
Allow me to explain how:  as market value increases, it requires more to "move the market" right now someone can move the price of bitcoin by selling a million dollars worth in the exchanges.    Google, by contrast which is valued at about a level where BTC would be at 18,000 a coin (depending how many have been mined by then) will barely move at all if someone buys or sells a million dollars worth.
The larger the size of something, the less volatility it will have (all else being equal) because it needs more investors and larger investors to move the price.
Bitcoin has another interesting  feature:   once many people reach a certain size of assets they print the keys and place them in cold storage....this GREATLY decreases the likelihood of them selling in a "panic sell" on the spur of the moment.  
Also, as people see the value increase and go through ups and downs, but overall more ups, they are more likely to hold....further decreasing volatility.    People who bought at 300, held when it crashed to 150 now are so much in the black that they are less phased by a move from 1000 to 700.... the longer someone holds and more profit they have, the less they are phased by daily swings.
How many BTC do I own?  I wish more!
Of course I want it to increase in value....I believe in the tech as a concept and solution and as a medium of exchange.....to be a medium of exchange that is widespread it needs a MUCH larger market cap and needs much more stability.....which can only happen when BTC is large enough that millions, even billions of dollars in buys and sells barely move the price.

The main problem with most wallets is that they are too hard to use and too confusing.
This community is so tech heavy that many devs forget what normal people are like --  most people have no idea how to, for example, set up their own blog or partition a drive or change an MX record in GoDaddy or swap out a hard drive.....these things are considered techy high end geek tasks by normal people.   
The kind of person who can do these things is considered a tech geek genius by mere mortals in the real world but average in this space and an idiot next to someone like Peter Todd.
For wallets to be more useful they need to be as easy as possible.  Armory is a good example of a wallet which, unfortunately, fails at this -- it's WAY to confusing and complex for anyone but a very technical person (not in THIS community but in general, the real world).  It's not clear what the QT is, how to DL It, why it takes so long, what files need to be kept secure etc.
Blockchain, IMHO, has succeeded because it's very simple and easy.  There are some improvements which could be better. Circle I think will be a great killer app due to ease of use.  Coinbase is simple as well (although the most recent interface change was a step in the wrong direction and the My Vault could have been executed better).
So -- for your multi-sig -- it should be clear and fool proof -- little tool tips or popups or whatever which explain "this is what this does" / "this is how this will work" / "this is address 1 or X and how it works" etc. -- little warnings like "don't share this private key / keep these separate" are helpful as well.
Checklists and really great tutorials / PDFs with current screenshots are very helpful as well.  I like Bitcoinpaperwallet.com -- I think it meets the "Gmail test" if you are techie enough to use Gmail without help (and a whole mess of people are NOT) then you can figure it out.
I'm happy to help more if I can / happy to look at screenshots or demos or whatever.
I might also be able to give more specific advice if I knew if this is a wallet for Android or PC or what.

Thanks-  this is more broad Bitcoin in general but here goes:
- Bitcoin isnt a company, its a protocol, think of it more like the Web or something
- flaws/ drawbacks of having Bitcoin -- there are several, one is that you either need to be fairly tech saavy or rely on someone else for security--  the main drawback in my opinion is volatility -  the price moves a lot and makes it very difficult to depend on what you have for expenses etc.
- I think the cards you are talking about exist -- there are many forms of securing Bitcoin called paper wallets and some are printed in card form ---  some services sell these but the best way to use them is to generate them yourself

Well first off, owning a million worth of Bitcoin makes someone every bit as much of a millionaire as someone who owns a million worth of gold,real estate or stock or cash.    By all the definitions of net worth used in law and financial planning it counts total assets.  Bitcoin is an asset.
But if you are completely hooked for some reason on not counting Bitcoin as part of the recognized methods of accounting and only count government fiat currency, then sure, yes, there are also plenty of multi millionaires in this category as well.   Many Bitcoin holders cashed in large chunks....in fact most, once they hit $10 mil or so, cashed in at least $1-2 million and paid off homes, bought gold or placed some in conventional cash bank accounts.

This is pretty typical.   
I've talked about Bitcoin to a number of top level guys like Dimon (I met him a couple years back -- didn't discuss Bitcoin)
Most of them have a very hard time understanding the concept -- they are not techies,  surprisingly not big on basic economic theory, they view new stuff with distrust and are very tradition bound -- 
There is also an insulated and herd mentality with big bankers-- they tend to hang around people exactly like themselves, same education background, pedigree etc. their social contacts/ friends are also peers.
So, when one big banker says something like "bitcoin is for drug laundering" then the others will repeat it.
If some oddball / outside the box economist on their staff, expert or guy like me slips through the cracks and gets an audience, they give it a basic consideration -- but still base their opinion on many other pieces of input (probably incorrect ones)
I've had a question or two come back from some of the guys I've talked to --- there is early interest, still massive misunderstanding and hurdles to overcome.
Dimons response is pretty typical.
Not in defense, but from their POV, these guys are inundated with every dumb idea on earth and everyone who meets them claims that something will change the world....moving the needle so to speak for them requires multi billion dollar deals and they are not trailblazers....they'd rather wait until an industry matures some more then swoop in and buy the major players for billions.
They also don't have lots of time and won't take the couple hours it might take for them to properly learn a Bitcoin basics.
I'm optimistic that Wall St is coming around.....nothing IMHO can move Bitcoin more mainstream and to higher value and stability than WS involvement.
Just like the internet, there will be WS players displaced, replaced, beaten, strengthened and new players will come along....depending how well they get this and listen.
Edited: clarity, I've met Dimon, NOT on Bitcoin, talked to other guys just like him ON Bitcoin

People will learn about it.
TV ads are a terrible investment for a new company like Circle.
Production and one ad cycle in prime time would cost $1mm and Circle only got $30 mm or so in VC money.
For that price they could hire people, attend conferences etc.
If they really want to do ads social media and even radio are both far cheaper and show more likelihood of someone taking action right then (like clicking, visiting and buying).

I don't think the "main purpose" is to circumvent government authority.
Yes, tax evasion and black market exist in the Bitcoin world just as they exist by several orders of magnitude in the cash world.
I am not a fan of the term "democracy" because the ability to vote is worthless if rights are not first guaranteed and any totalitarian system is no better than a democracy without rights guaranteed.   In democracy without rights 51% can vote to rob enslave or kill 49%.
But what a Bitcoin means for human rights and freedom is significant -- less reliance on central authority and corruption.

Looks like I'll be wrong on this one.
The prediction was a simple shot.  It's pretty hard to predict the future but we can always make a best guess.
I still think we will see the 3000 level at some point in the relatively near future and I still think we will see a rapid price run up similar to the previous major run up but not quite as extreme.
I think one major driver of this will be Wall St. investment and another will be the implementation of so many venture backed investments.
I would have thought that a publicly traded Wall St. vehicle would have been opened by now.  When it does I think we'll see a price move which should more more than 10%.
For this year I don't know what price we'll see but of course I'd revise my estimate down based on the price we see today.

It's a state rep campaign -- the campaign emailed and asked for a donation.  I replied, "sure if you accept Bitcoin" and provided a link to Bitpay and their campaign guidance and a link to FEC guidance.  A couple days later they replied that they had checked it and could accept -- I then sent a small contribution.   State Rep campaigns are very small and I'm sure that they did not engage consultants.  I am also sure they didn't make claims of being first or publicize Bitcoin -- I am likely the only one who donated.  They are local freinds of my family.  I think it very likely they took the contribution as a cash conversion.

Sorry but I dont think you have a real philosophy if you cant articulate it.
Bringing up Reason Mag is another form of logical fallacy.
You ridicule these ideas --- but what do you offer in return.
Have some conviction and stand by what you yourself said.  You said Shrem deserves prison because "he violated the law".
Is that the beginning and end of your philosophy?   If not, then say so, if so then think about its logic and limits.
Honestly I dont think you have really thought these things through or you would have answered the questions.  Questions like "Exactly what laws are worth following?"  / "Do you support the jailing of the pastor in Florida?"  are perfectly reasonable questions and if you had a clear cut philosophy on how just your statement is you'd be able to answer them instantly.
This is how I answered dozens of questions in a short time ---  by having a clear philosophy that I can articulate.    Mine is "Do no harm to others unless they have done harm first or in defense and dont support others who would do such harm"
I might be wrong -- I'd love to consider it and learn why.   But I have a philosophy to base that on and change or strengthen or articulate my opinions.
No offense but I dont think you have such a philosophy -- I dont think you have thought these things through --  this is why you cant answer simple questions and seem to have a mis-matched strategy of sort of 'you know it when you see it' kind of thing ---  you likely do NOT agree with my examples about Nigeria jailing gays - but you cant articulate why --  because its not part of a coherent philosophy ---  you dont want to answer the question about the pastor in Florida because you dont agree with it but know that saying he should go to jail (just like Shrem) doesnt make sense to you.
Think it through.
By man or woman enough to admit that you cant really answer those questions because you dont have a system or basis of beliefs that helps answer them----  or prove me wrong and answer them

It is very small now – – please keep in mind that Bitcoin, despite being an amazing thing which has received a good deal of media attention, is still very very small – – the market, at less than $10 billion, Is less than half that of Inktomi, just one of the failed dot-coms from the.com bubble.
So part of it would be making the market much larger – – I’m looking at a target of at least $400 billion – – something similar to what the Winkelvoss brothers are predicting for a near to intermediate term target – – perhaps within five years or so (but this is all radical speculation, it could go to zero) – – clearly, if Bitcoin becomes a very real thing with a significant piece of any kind of overall global commerce it could be much larger than that even – – but that is the first step.
The second step is already occurring, thanks to many venture capitalists and so on, there are many new sources and ways for people to buy Bitcoin and trade Bitcoin and accept Bitcoin coming online as we speak

This kind of thing happens every day -- Wal Mart gets a thousand letters about 500 different things -- people boycott when their favorite show is cancelled -- people sell stocks because they don't like one subsidiary etc.
This was taken the wrong way by many and I take responsibility for that -- my intent was never to have people spam messages of "F off" to Tim Cook or something.   Only to apply a reasonable (and tiny) amount of pressure to get them to see that banning these apps is a bad business idea.   
I like Apple, I've bought 6 iPads and 4 phones and have a couple macs -- I made money on the stock -- but I'm not giving them new business until they change -- it's only fair to let them know that and if enough do so they will change.
Business isn't adversarial -- this isn't a schoolyard -- it's a matter of showing them that banning these Bitcoin apps is bad business.   They want to do good business, they don't want to lose market share to Samsung--   That's all

I have been in financial services for 20+ years and employed many people.
If the State of Massachusetts tomorrow promises not to handcuff me, cage me and seize my property then I will create 100 news jobs and start an exchange.
I will not start an exchange in Massachusetts because I fear the men with boots and guns they would send to my door.
...all because I choose to speak and transmit math in a new manner they may not understand.
So, many reason that we should beg them for more regulation and restriction because if we don't, they will regulate and restrict us anyway.   I disagree with this moral premise and it should be fought.
Not fought as a radical antagonist, I've dealt with these regulators for many years and I'm not dumb enough to kick a rabid dog....but fought by asking them the tough questions about what moral right they have to regulate us and getting them to think that many massive drawbacks of regulation.

There has been some high profile examples of Wall Street investors getting in on Bitcoin – – one venture company, Circle Internet Financial, had a high profile Wall Street person join the board, a couple other major Wall Street players like Fortress and Second Market have officially announced entrance into Bitcoin and a couple others such as hedge funds or more quietly becoming involved – –
Having said that, no, there is not really significant interest or understanding on Wall Street – – I have talked to many, many Wall Street people even technically advanced venture capitalists and others – – and the understanding level and acceptance level is still extremely low – – many people do not have even the most basic grasp of it and have only read an article or two or talk to people in passing and have massive misconceptions about what Bitcoin is and how it works.
To be honest – – talking to my fellow Wall Street professionals about Bitcoin can be a little bit frustrating – – there lack of understanding, in some cases is so great – – some of them think of it as a completely different thing from what it really is

- I've also never declared bankruptcy 
- the only disclosable event on my FINRA U4 license is that I renegotiated about $20k in credit card debt in around 2006 I believe -- I actually dont think this was required to be disclosed as a material financial event but my compliance officer at the time encouraged me to do so to be sure
- the only legal issues I have ever had have been traffic issues (none in the last 10 years) and an idiotic prank with a toy gun 25 years ago when I was age 17 - this case was continued without a finding and then closed when I joined the Navy
- I was a FINRA General Securities Principal for about 18 years - no one I ever supervised (about 12 registered stockbrokers/ financial professionals) ever had a customer complaint or regulatory action
- the most spectacular failure I was involved with was attempting to set up a US based version of a Dubai fund - the deal fell through and I was stuck with the legal and setup fees of over $450k and a lot of wasted time -- we had no investors in the fund and had not accepted client funds for it

Why would Bitcoin proponents want Wall Street involvement?
Because that's the only way right now to get the massive types of cash inflow that makes BTC a real thing with global weight and importance (I define that as something the size of a large company or a piece of a real currency...BTC is very far from that now, despite how much I love it)
How else does it grow to $100 billion / .5 trillion?     ATM transactions at 20,000 of them a day for the next century?   
Venture Capital is definitely part of Wall Street if you are talking in terms of financial and investment companies.....these are a great thing for companies like Coinbase etc.

I think Williams said it "will" reach that price and made a point of making that what his speeches were about and proactively stating his prediction.
For me, if I recall, someone asked for a random guess / crystal ball prediction and I threw out a high number which was very loosely based on my thoughts that a large run up would occur.   That's all.
I certainly didn't write reports or make price prediction a big issue in speeches --- even if I had I don't mind being wrong on this -- that's the nature of crazy predictions.   The only possibilities are lucking out or being wrong - it's like sports predictions etc.   The only other response you can make is to no answer the question.
What history will judge those of us actively promoting the space as is where Bitcoin is in 5 years or so.   It's likely binary: either a very low price of $5 or less or a very high price of many thousands.   It's very risky and no one should invest more than they can afford to lose.   I might very well be extremely wrong but I think we will see the later.

We don't know exactly how it will grow or even if it will grow at all....but if it does then it seems likely that the players in this space grow the way major players in other spaces have grown:  social media, the internet before that, networking and storage, PC companies before them etc.
You are talking about fiat as if it's already the year 2050 and Bitcoin is 59% of the global economy... even if it was the case the other 41% will still prefer it for various reasons.   Right now BTC is not remotely close to 1% -- I think the Winkelvoss have an ambitious and bullish view (which I happen to agree with) of a $400 billion or so market cap in five years --- this places one BTC at $40,000 and Coinbase would have a great chance at being a huge and successful company ---moving exactly on the path I'm talking about.....but even at these (great!) growth rates BTC would still not cover 99.5% of world money.
There is a path that companies almost always take to go from small to large:  they get a prototype, get angel or founder funding, get rolling, get an early VC, grow a bit, get more advanced VC rounds, do an IPO, use that capital to grow more such as internationally, build a war chest for aquisitiins etc and then as large public companies they work with large PE firms and investment banks making strategic acquisitions etc.  
For disruptive technology the acquisitions sometimes include old players from the old model.
This is the way things have happened in 99% of cases of major growth stories for a long long time.   Maybe Coinbase will be an exception....I don't see why it would be especially since I'm pretty sure that all it's major leadership and investors/ backers would not want it to be....but if it is an exception it would be one of the few...if Bitcoin becomes transformative and huge then this is very very likely the path that companies will take to growth.

I get the argument against violence -- I make similar arguments every day.
But that in itself does not define a natural right -- we could make the same argument about someone using someone's home or borrowing their tools after being specifically told not to.   Would that warrant a response using force?  Yes.
As far as your picture of a dog -- that's your right, it's your property and you absolutely do have the right to own that and control it.   Copyright law is pretty clear on this type of stuff -- if you threw it out there for the world to see and did not copyright it then you've placed it in the public domain and lost rights to claim it.    If, on the other hand you spent 100 hours framing the perfect shot with a $3000 camera (time and cost are irrelevant, just used to make the example better) and you had a private showing in your art studio of the dog photo which YOU are creator -- for right or wrong, believe is profound or significant or whatever and you charge $50 for people to see it and someone snaps a photo of it and shares it as a meme etc. No, that's not their right -- it's your property.   
We can debate about whether downloads help the industry or whatever but the real core of it is whether art and software etc. is property of the people who spend time and money to creator and whether creators have rights to decide when and where they will be compensated for it.
I believe your dog photo is your property and if you want to charge $1000 for someone to view it that's your right -- it is not their right to simply take it because they want it regardless of how much time, money or brilliance when into it's creation.

Thank you.
Sure it does-  right now we have me, the president and the decisions made by the founding members.
Often organizations in the non-profit space have bylaws and other systems which giver permanent centralized power to certain leaders.
We are committing to a system without any special abilities for me or any other founding member.  We are essentially giving up all central power and authority and committing to open and fair voting and elections systems for members for decisions.
At the VERY least, even without the programming,  this means that future power will be in the hands of a completely transparently elected body who is totally accountable to the membership.   As we get the programming done this will mean a digital autonomous organization.  Either way is much less centralized than we were yesterday and much less so than most non-profits -  even some large and successful ones have centralized and unaccountable power structures.

It doesn't matter if it's an exchange, bank, pawn shop or parking garage there is a difference between customer property and the property of a company they place property with.

Kraken has 
1) a cartoon picture on the login page UNIQUE TO YOUR IP -- you from your home PC you will see a picture of a dog or something .....a phishing site will not know the picture so it will be harder to fool people
2). You can "lock" your account for anywhere from 1-30 days -- this means that you can freeze ALL transfers or chafes for this time --- so, for example, if you lock it for 5 days you could give away your phone and password to a hacker and there is nothing they could do for 5 days, presumably enough time to call support and reset, reverify etc.
ALL EXCHANGES AND WALLET SERVICES SHOULD OFFER PEOPLE THE ABILITY TO LIMIT TRANSACTIONS --- so you could set a .5 Bitcoin limit or something -- this is so basic and so sad that they don't do it

It depends on whether you believe the foundation can be helpful or not.
A couple people misunderstood what I meant by "excessive regulation" - I am absolutely NOT one of the people who says "we need regulation / we want smart regulation" etc.
I am very anti-regulation.   What I meant by excessive is anything that goes beyond the legitimate role of government....for me this is limited to protection of life liberty and property.
In the case of Bitcoin we are mainly talking about property and most of that is covered by existing laws against theft, hacking, fraud etc.
I think that laws which have no clear victim are illegitimate -- this includes laws outlawing drugs, prostitution, marriage etc.
I don't support ANY law governing Bitcoin where there is no victim.   I don't support money laundering laws, requiring a license to use math or transmit money etc.
I believe Ben Lawsky to be a corrupt, violent and dishonest opportunist who is an enemy to technology, progress, jobs and our space.
The ONLY regulation I support are those which protect consumers and Bitcoin holders.   I would support language which clarifies existing laws to cover Bitcoin.  For example - specifying that theft of someone's private keys is larceny.
I am absolutely against the Bitlicense etc.  
I do think it is legitimate for government to prosecute theft of keys, hacking or fraud.  It is one of the few legitimate roles of government.
Aside from this, I would and do encourage regulators to understand the tech and if they must be involved to use technical solutions rather than regs -- for example if they want proof of reserves I'd rather see this not done by government at all but if it is done by government I'd rather see them use a technical means of audit using blockchain tech rather than more laws.

Circle can be used for an easy purchasing option without needing to trust them....people can simply move the coins immediately.

No that's not what is talking about at all.
So odd that so many people assume all investment professionals are in favor of QE or bailouts.  Not me.
What I meant by creating new wealth without taking it is that when I buy land for $100,000 and wood for $100,000 and build a house worth $300,000 -- that new wealth was created from nothing --- it wasn't robbed from anyone else.
Steve Jobs making $6 billion off Apple doesn't mean he screwed someone and stole it-- this is the thing many people don't understand about wealth --- often people who don't have wealth and who were taught negative things about money growing up --- they assume that because someone has money, they took it from another--   That's not the case --- even the most ruthless private equity and venture capital people want to make those around them richer....they may want a bigger piece for themselves...but they want to make others rich too  
@_date: 2014-10-04 23:51:20
Isn't it only fraud if I lied and said they were my works.
What if I call it "Fentons Game of Thrones" and have a disclaimer saying "the world and characters in this story were created by someone else"
How is it fraud if I make a new Star Wars movie?  What if I write the movie?
In the Skyrim example -- to be more specific:   I copy the engine, look and feel, city names, character names and back stories and add some new stuff and call it a sequel.
Fraud is pretty specific and right now these cases would not have much of a claim for fraud --- especially if the one who appropriated the works made a disclaimer.
Without intellectual property rights we are basically saying to Andreas or George RR Martin or George Lucas/ Disney ---  "your stuff is not your stuff, it's my stuff if I want it" -- fraud laws don't come close to protecting the examples I made.  The only recourse people have is IP laws.
To use fraud laws, they'd have to be altered significantly to take into account IP.
I think most would agree that NBC can't simply take George RR Martins book and make a TV show.   Why can't they?
If someone gives something away and says "Creative Commons / non commercial / attribution" and a commercial business says "nah, we are using it anyway".  That's not fraud -- it's theft.

&lt;&lt;&lt;Bruce - do you think the response to Ben Lawsky's attempt at communicating with the bitcoin "community" been appropriate?
No - I think we've given him far too much attention and focus.  He has proven himself to be dishonest and I do not believe his attempts to communicate were a genuine effort to learn from us but more an effort for him to advance politically, be seen as a key figure in this space and soften the community to his ambitions.
&lt;&lt;Do you think any other government official will try to consult the bitcoin community after the way Lawsky has been treated?
Other officials already do consult us.  I just met with a regulator this month.   The difference is that other regulators are not as press focused and career focused as Lawsky.   He seeks personal fame and recognition far more than serving the public IMHO.
&lt;&lt;&lt;Do you agree with the response to Ben Lawsky's AMA?
Not sure specifically what you mean / in what way.   I believe the AMA and the hearings were a media show and we were played the fool.  It didn't surprise me a bit -- I warned people in bitcoin about regulators before most had heard of Lawsky and I was critical of him during the AMA.   
Some are surprised and feel betrayed at his North Korea style Bitcoin ban.  It surprises me no more than getting bitten by a scorpion you invite into your hands.

Yes -- but people who got into the Internet in 1999 instead of 1991 don't feel dumb so much....especially if they make millions a year.
Also, in fairness, some don't really care about things until they get large-- the REAL top of the food chain guys, heads of MAJOR banks, hedge funds, private equity firms --- for them there is nothing big enough to be worth buying in the BTC space yet.   They are not going to waste time on some silly little $50 mm VC investment or buying $100 mm in coins ---- they will wait until Coinbase or Circle or something grows to $300, 400, 800 million in value and then they will buy a majority stake for $3 billion and grow it then take it public and turn it into a $10-20 billion company....that's how they role.

From what I understand they process the cards as cash advances which has much more favorable chargeback rules for the merchant (Circle).
Also, I am guessing that they've invested heavily on software which reconciles identity with known fraud.
For my investment co we used to have a service which would track fake IDs -- I have no idea how it worked but we paid a bunch of money and every few months or so when processing an account we'd get a call from some old gravely voiced former FBI type who'd say "Account GHB 67328 is fraud, we know the address and name.

No – – more Bitcoin’s will not be released because the number of coins is essentially fixed within the computer source code running the Bitcoin protocol – – a lot of people ask about this concept of a finite number of coins – – it’s a common question and a great question – – thank you.
One of the important things to note about Bitcoin is that it’s infinitely divisible – – so for example the smallest unit right now, called a Satoshi, is worth far less than one penny – – even if each Bitcoin becomes worth about $1 million then the tiny portion is only worth about a penny.
So, if Bitcoin does turn out to be a real thing and succeeds and grows to be any portion of even a fraction of the real global economy – – than what we would expect to see is things being traded in fractions of Bitcoins rather than full Bitcoins

If theft or fraud is illegal it doesn't matter what the object is.  It's like saying that someone is allowed to steal Teslas because there is no law specific to Tesla.  Fraud is illegal -- if they had to make a new law for every new thing invented then con artists would be able to run with abandon whenever something new came out.

I've also worked with some wealthy people and yes, as someone noted billionaires can live in NYC without a problem -- but they have long standing systems in place- security, lawyers etc.  the main risk here is that this is new news and if this is Satoshi he doesn't have systems in place

There is a tendency in this community to have an accusatory tone without evidence that warrants it.
The tone of this seems to be accusatory and not giving Andreas the benefit of the doubt.
What I get get from this is a line of questioning that is essentially asking "Did Andreas know this would fall apart and not tell anyone because of financial incentive?"
Frankly that's a massive and extreme claim/ accusation which should not be made without evidence.
And yes, asking a question IS a form of claim or accusation.  It's akin to asking someone at your office if they stole your wallet....pretty offensive unless you have extremely solid evidence.  The anonymous nature of Reddit makes it so people sometimes forget logic and reason.   
This community should root out and crush the dishonest actors in our space....but we should also take a logical and fact based approach to accusations and never, ever support accusations which are not backed by solid facts.
Words like this are extremely serious and damaging and unless they lead to solid proof that Andreas acted badly (which I seriously and almost certainly know is not the case) then the OP has done a disservice to the community and to Andreas.
There is NOTHING close to evidence here presented which shows ANY wrongdoing whatsoever by Andreas.
The post combines hearsay with speculation with accusatory tone and speculation -- for example the implication Andreas "aggressively promoted" Neo -- where is the evidence of this?  I'm not an Andreas expert....I've only seen him speak 7-8 times in person including yesterday and a couple dozen on video, maybe the OP knows better....but I've never seen a single mention of Neo by him, let alone a promotion.
It's fine to investigate and be skeptical and to demand high standards in this community.  But it's absolutely not fine to make accusations about serious matters without solid evidence.

I believe the first time I heard about it was when the phony hacker requested Bitcoin as bribery on his threat to reveal presidential candidate Gov. Mitt Romney’s tax return information – – at the time I kind of looked into what Bitcoin is and did not have a huge understanding of it or strong opinion one way or another
As I became more interested in it in the last year and a half one of my first reactions was that it was very speculative not backed by anything real and that governments could very easily shut it down – – over the last 6 to 9 months those concerns have decreased mainly because I have seen more serious money entering it, more serious venture capital investments, I’ve met more serious players in the business and attended conferences and learned a lot more about Bitcoin and understanding the huge deal that is the underlying technology

I think 2.0 projects are great with tons of potential.  I follow Ethereum, Factom, Counterparty and other projects and agree with David Johnston that (almost) everything that can be decentralized will be.
These projects have massive potential to change our world.
For alt coins -- I'm a fan because I think a rising tide lifts all boats -  even a failed alt coin hopefully can create new ideas or development.
I do think that Bitcoin is and should be the main standard.
I actually have an idea for an alt coin which, unlike most alt coins, actually is quite different and solves different problems than Bitcoin --- I'm advising some people working on this and am hoping it can be built on top of the same Blockchain -- in parallel.   I think this is the best model.

Well, it's got a solid core group of early adopters...but for true mainstream adoption there will be decisions to accept made by tradition-bound gray haired conservatives who work at IBM or Google or eBay or Ford or whatever.    
Our community is a bubble of outliers....we are not "normal" people and the ideas we have are scary to many...Bitcoin is already misunderstood and surrounded with bad press and perception.   
We are better off spending time and energy on showing the benefits and problems solved rather than appearing to be money laundering pirates.
And as far as mainstream etc. Don't get me wrong I would like to see more "grown ups" in the movement who speak carefully and deliberately, present well and can reach the masses.   But I absolutely DO NOT want more regulation and regulators.  
As far as the mainstream Bitcoin advocates from the financial world I break from many in that I am VERY against the notion of "we have to get it regulated so they accept it" -- NO that is akin to saying "we've invented something new let's grovel for permission to not be handcuffed, beaten and caged by our overlords". 
So no, I don't want regulations -- I just want to see some faces who don't terrify the masses.

With the way global finance works and compliance and treaties etc. it's very easy for any companies involved in traditional aspects of finance like banks.
They can subpoena records - cross reference with records of NY residents etc.
Once a company is found or suspected to be out of compliance they can send a letter and sue them -- ignoring this could get them in trouble with their own local government or have them arrested if they enter the US again.
If someone is totally virtual then they could ignore this....but the NY regs prohibit ALL companies licensed from even associating with a virtual company.

It's sharia compliant.
It is not pegged to the dollar like the Riyal.   With the Riyal, Saudi does not have an independent currency.   It's not even partly independent.  It's totally pegged to the US --- for all purposes it's basically the US Dollar only with a different picture on it and different denominations.   That is one reason you've had high inflation -- it also ties KSA to the economic fate of the US....which is no where near as optimistic as years ago when the leg was made.
It's very easy for international dealings -- especially as it grows and becomes more accepted --  Saudis tend to do lots of things in the EU, Asia or US or elsewhere in the Gulf.  Bitcoin is a global currency and can be used all those places without needing to exchange it.   
 Also, for trading families and complex operations there is a lot of work in dealing with old school systems for moving money around -- it can take many days to wire funds to other countries.

NYDFS has proven themselves to be dishonest and not operating with good or honorable intentions.
They have outright lied to the community on more than one occasion and Bitlicense shows that they don't care about what is right or what makes sense but about a corrupt relationship with banks.
They have harmed us and continue harming us.
In return we've made Ben Lawsky famous...giving him exactly what he wants - more power, more fame and furthering his career.
It's us, who have given him significance.   It's us who have made him a news topic.  It's we who have upvoted his Reddit posts as if he graces us with some sort of favor.

Thank you, and thanks for the Facebook shoutout -- I've got about 85,000 people on there so someone likes the message it seems.  The page is facebook.com/brucefentonpage
For your questions:
1-  In an ideal situation I'd like to see regulation pretty much limited to the protection of life, freedom and property of people -- for Bitcoin this mostly relates to property --- and also mostly is covered by existing laws -- such as theft -- we could use some fine tuning on these laws for example to make it easier for people who had private keys stolen or were hack victims to seek prosecution of the thieves.  I think this is a legitimate role of government and regulators.  Another example would be in enforcement of contracts and prevention of fraud - if a Bitcoin business or person lied to someone or misled them or breeched a contract causing loss, this is a valid area for government to be involved with.
Now, not I said an "ideal situation" unfortunately regulators are eager to go far beyond the legitimate role of government and protecting consumers.  In some cases they are well meaning regulators who actually care about public complaints and people being ripped off or defrauded -- they don't want another Mt Gox on thier watch.  For these regulators we should educate them about TECHNICAL solutions to reduce reliance on trust: transparency, blockchain tech, proof of reserves, multi-sig keys and governance etc.   
The other type of regulators, such as people like Ben Lawsky, don't really care about consumer protection at all. They care about headlines and furthering their career and are often dishonest and harmful.  These regulators are harder to deal with and should be called out and fought on the issues whenever possible.
2). I'm not super worried about the Foundation becoming too big at this stage.  We should definitely guard against paths to potential abuses.  One way to do this is by using this technology we are involved with to increase transparency and reduce potential for abuses.  For example we could have a transparent blockchain record of who contributions come in and where they go and make use of multi sig wallets etc.  I'm careful to say that there is a difference between a good idea and something the board should push for.  I would not yet go so far as to say that this is something the board should be pushing or forcing because there are a lot of factors and Patrick would be the one to make those decisions.
@_date: 2014-08-24 23:15:08
Those who seek to use the state to seize assets from others by force or use state force to compel humans who have harmed no other person to comply with various rules and laws governing everything from someone's idea of morality to marriage to food intake are violent people.
Does this make sense, if not, how do you see it otherwise?  Do you not see government force as violence or do you not see laws backed by men with guns and jails as violent?
@_date: 2014-07-14 14:21:05
Why does someone get to decide what to do with someone else's property?
I don't think that use of force defines what a right is.  If someone peacefully camps on another's front yard and needs to be removed by force it doesn't mean the camper was right to do so.

Sure --  I served as a trustee to Wilbraham Monson Academy, The Global School
I was active on the MIT Enterprise Forum and have been an active member of various financial industry groups.  I was the General Securities Principal for a FINRA office for a New England Law Firms investment practice.
I have not run for office or held an elected position.
In 2013 I set up and exploratory committee to run for United States Congress in the 5th District Special Election Seat vacated by Senator Ed Markey.  I decided against running due to the time commitment relative to chance of success.
I've been involved in many campaigns.
I was a volunteer for Ron Paul -  I've donated to Justin Amash, Rand Paul and Thomas Massie.
These politicians and Gary Johnson, who I voted for, most accurately reflect my political beliefs today.
Prior to this I was a republican -- I supported George HW Bush, Ross Perot, and the first election of GW Bush.  I became so disillusion with George W Bush that I switched to independent and supported Gen Wesley Clark, Dennis Kucinich and Howard Dean -  I was a pretty active Dean volunteer.  Once Kerry won the nomination I appeared on a MoveOn ad against Bush.   In the 10 years since then I learned a lot more about liberty and libertarian ideas.   I supported (D) Steve Pagliuca for US Senate -  he is a personal friend.  
Other than this, I am pretty focused on libertarian candidates.  Locally I support State Senator Bob Hedlund, State Rep Leah Cole, Brad Wyatt (who was defeated) and Josh Cutler who was the first pol in Mass to accept Bitcoin.
I am a signer to the NH Free State pledge.
My corporate experience that is relevant is that I have been a regulated financial professional for 22 years.  I've also dealt with some very large and complex clients - I have probably met 80% of the Forbes list for example and been involved in very large deals.

Yes – – we also need to recognize that there are different types of volatility –
we could be sitting at home with a nice comfortable nest egg of $1 million and – although that $1 million looks like it has not changed in value or fluctuated very much – – relative to the world it may have – – more importantly it most certainly has fluctuated in fact lost value – cause of fed policies and printing new money – – if the Fed prints money that accounts for 20% of overall money supply – that you have essentially lost 20% of the value of your money even though that volatility doesn’t show up.

It's a good thought but I think more complex than that.
Just knowing where money went by looking at block chain only is part of it.....many challenges with charity fraud are from people up and leaving with the money which was supposed to go somewhere.
Another thing is that fraudsters could say that 300 coins which went to a certain address were for medicine or whatever and make a fake receipt when really they went to a buddy who bought 10 coins worth of medicine and pocketed the rest.
There is also a challenge that, while some things are great in transparency, others might still have need for privacy such as if a charity pays for an employees drug rehabilitation program as part of an HR effort to give someone a chance rather than termination etc.
But the way, Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation is a major client of my company.  But please note I can't speak too much on details and by all means absolutely nothing I say should every be construed as official policy of the Foundation or any foundation leader or member in any way.

This assumes that you think banks and the system of capitalized lending (which, in reality is accomplished through radical borrowing and fractional reserves) is a good thing.   I don't.
For a LONG time before the lending and modern banking scam we see today we had savings as a contributor to economic growth.
I made a few examples in this thread of people ranging from very poor to very rich who can have new opportunities to improve the economy by saving.....without banks.

The market should not have a problem absorbing $1 million or so – – contrary to popular belief – – I have seen this personally and I get can be done – – many people are concerned about blocks of hundred thousand dollars or so I don’t think that’s a reasonable concern – – if I had $100 million to allocate the Bitcoin it would probably take between one and three months and it would move the market

Personally I think Bitcoin will go up a great deal this year.
But everyone should remember that it is a highly speculative experiment and they can lose every single penny they invest in Bitcoin.  People should only put money in Bitcoin that they can afford to lose.
If we look at the overall market cap relative to the amount of press, VC investment and public interest then Bitcoin has massive upside potential.
I think we could see Bitcoin at 10,000-50,000 or more within five years if it exists with any value by then.
@_date: 2014-01-03 19:54:53
Well if you wanted to buy something worth a billion with BTC then you'd first need to buy the BTC and then there WOULD be enough....even if it was a fraction of a coin.
Explanation: you have your billion in fiat you want to convert to BTC -- you go on MtGox to buy, you don't care about price so you put in one huge fat market order for one billion USD --- meanwhile every single holder on planet earth simultaneously decides not to sell--  your market order isn't accepted....it isn't accepted again....there is no trade on any exchange --- the bid goes up....up ----- eventually it reaches $10 billion for one BTC and finally some lowly Reddit guy breaks ranks with every other person on planet earth and he accepts a billion dollars for his 1/10 of one BTC.   You now go and buy your island or whatever you were going to buy for one billion dollars worth of BTC ....and transfer your 1/10 of a coin over to the other party.
Now in reality obviously all trading would never stop -- I use that as an extreme example to illustrate that as long as any single individual on planet earth is willing to sell some tiny fraction of BTC, then there will always be "enough" coins.  In RL there would of course be active trading and you really could put a billion with MtGox (there's the challenge of the wire of course) and place a market order --- even a million can move the price so obviously a billion would quite a bit---   But not that much, it's less than 10% of overall market cap-- so that billion dollar buy order would just simply eat up all the sells (and supersede all buys) until it was gone -- it would be a crazy few days but eventually the order would be filled and the price would reflect the ease on demand -- likely crashing back once the order was filled--- but it would be done --- we never run out of BTC

Haha -- it's out of my control.   I know some basic info and know people who seem to know some things but I don't have solid enough info to speak with authority on it -- especially on the lions den of Reddit where they slightest factual mistep can doom one to a fate worse than a tiger at the 777 ranch.
Here's what I can say:  my best guess is that they are slowly, but surely, working on this and that it will be released and available.  It takes a lot of time and they have massive regulatory hoops - but my best guess is that it will work.   I also think that Barry's BIT will be available publicly traded/  to the general public in time (it was orginally 25k minimum, not public).  The billion dollar question is when?  I would have hoped three months ago.

In my job I was involved in the early days of the web and see how tech works and grows -- I've dealt with VCs and investors at very high levels and although I'm personally an anarchist leaning rebel, I am able to interact effectively with very mainstream groups and people - as a small business owner I'm a generalist and I have a ton of passion and drive for this tech.

But of course I noted he's dead in the description so the implication in that is that it is total and complete speculation on my part because there is no other way to make such a claim.....so anyone can judge it wrong or have equal right to a counter claim.

Two notes on this 1) it seems unlikely they'd simply jump right to fines -- usually companies are contacted first and an action is brought --- it's very uncommon to have the first time you hear of something be "dear business, you have been fined $100k"
2) if you are exempt I don't think it makes sense to proactively contact FinCen --- it's like writing a letter to the IRS telling them you are not evading taxes --- attracts attention without much upside ---- I'd say to ask legal advice on this first -- with the caveat that sometimes legal advice is also self serving to get more hours

It doesn't prove the point - but it is relevant.
Its ironic because when someone violates every regulation in the book its bizarre to think that more regulations would have stopped that.
If new regulations require an additional 10 pages in a prospectus for example it does nothing to affect a fraudster who has a fake prospectus.
Madoff had a 17 page tip reported on him to the SEC and they ignored it.  He broke many existing laws..... new laws are a silly solution -- had they properly enforced existing laws he would have been caught earlier.

Guys like Dimon essentially get all their info from a small number of sources:
- occasional newspapers and books...usually very mainstream, WSJ, Pulitzer Prize winning books etc. - I say occasionally because a lot of them have even less time than normal people to review info-- they will almost never do their own research and probably don't even have a basic concept of something like Reddit and won't have much exposure to anything off the beaten path (there are exceptions with some hedge fund people etc. who look at more unusual info sources but I'd say this is almost a rule with bank leaders)
- other ultra big shots, small talk around deals, on charitable boards and at social events, Davos etc.
- a small inner circle, family, their assistant etc.
- occasional outside experts and consultants...even these guys (me when I'm lucky enough) are heavily screened and filtered and rarely will have a large amount of time with them -- even if they hire a major consulting firm who then gets input from someone, it's filtered with the highest level guy at the consulting firm summarizing for someone like Dimon, or, much more often, a lower level (but still,really senior) executive making those decisions and reporting in broad strokes to people at Dimons level 
- emails on their Blackberry 
It's interesting that these guys are on one hand very experienced and worldly, they meet thousands of people and are exposed to lots of ideas....but in the other hand very isolated and subject to groupthink etc.
Don't underestimate them though....regardless of who the bank head is...most range from smart to unbelievably smart....all have staff members at all levels who are some of the most brilliant people you could ever meet...guys who have achieved at the highest levels since pre-school and who can grasp new ideas very quickly ---- a firm half the size of JP Morgan could triple the size and price of Bitcoin in record time with a sliver of a sliver of a piece of some part of a single little business unit.
For example, JP Morgan has a nice unit which helps new hedge funds get off the ground by introducing them to potential investors (JPs benefit is that it gets trading revenue if those funds become large) --- that little piece of a unit of one piece of the alternatives group at JP has probably raised 10 times the value of all Bitcoin in existence.   
The scope and scale of these groups is hard to convey.
The good news is that leaders like Dimon will no doubt come around (most of them anyway, or thier successors) like they did with the Internet.....but they don't need to in order to have a positive impact....other really senior people do get it and will get it and help  Bitcoin....there is also a great opportunity for transformative upstarts and next tier or new banks to get ahead of the curve

Lighten up.   I believe in keeping your own keys.   Circle is a great onramp and that is needed.
Just pointing out that there is a difference between something like Gox and a well funded well staffed operation.
How exactly do you propose getting mass adoption?   Do you want more people to use Bitcoin?  I do.
Should we convince all these grannies and dentists and school teachers who don't know what 2FA is, don't know what Wordpress is and who need IT to setup a Gmail address to what...simply download Armory and get some coins on localbitcoins?
The hurdles for normal users are insurmountable without more companies like Circle.

Those are good points -- but one bigger point is that the tech is better....it's not perfect yet -- I think I mentioned early in the post that one limitation is old banking systems.
When electricity came out it was a total pain in the neck to use-- dangerous, in need of lines which no one had, incompatible with existing systems etc.   But it was better.
Same for the internet
This little experiment shows that this is better and the concerns you mention will be wiped away if this grows the way many of us think it will.

Well it definitely causes problems....again, not defending but from their POV they'd probably point out just how huge and complex everything they do is.   
If I'm playing the part of Dimon and being devils advocate he might say "okay, I get to guys like Bruce bitcoin is important, so I don't get the details, China is also important I've got my head of China meeting me in 10 min, India is important, Syria is important etc."
They may be personally insulated but they have huge staffs and many really smart people working for them -- but yes, the herd mentality is a problem.
I've talked economics with these guys -- they think that people like Ron Paul are absolutely nuts and something like "end the Fed" is received  about as well as talking about UFO landing theories.
Someone like Max Keiser or Andreas Antonopolous would be thought of as so bizarre they could not even comprehend them.
But eventually....if Bitcoin works they will buy up some major players, take tens of billions in stakes and out hundreds of staff dedicated to the project.

Also even AUM is misleading --- Joe broker has Mr Rich as a client with $100 mm--- mr Rich came to Joe from Snobstreet Advisors,  Joe works at Merrill, he places Mr. Rich in the ML Consults program and they select XYZ as a manager, XYZ custodies the money at Pershing and they buy a Goldman fund with some of the assets --- now....question....Who claims what as AUM?
Jo e:  $100 mm
Snobstreet :  $100 mm
ML  :  $100 mm
XYZ :  $100 mm
Pershing :  $100 mm
Goldman :  $100 mm
Essentially $800 mm is listed on brochures somewhere as part of AUM all from the same $100mm client.
This is misleading because if you add up the stated assets of the huge players, they are really counting the same assets multiple times

Sarcasm is usually what people resort to when they don't have a solid argument.
Why not think on it and actually address the points?  You brought it up after all.
Think on it.  Money laundering is only a crime because the government says it is -- there is no victim.  Essentially it is a tool of government control.  They use terrorism as an excuse etc. but that's generally BS -- Ben Lawsky had the nerve to invoke 9-11 as the reason for his Bitlicense -- but in reality those are fear tactics - the only actual victims of money laundering are those in government who seek to control people more.
The government will tel, U.S. that money laundering enables other crimes - but everything enables crimes -- phones, computers, cars, shoes.  With these laws we end up placing people like Charlie Shrem in jail who have harmed no one at all....and do very little to stop actual crime which has real victims.

Yes, it's really me.
Good question....some plans cannot be bootstrapped.....like the idea for FedEx or something which required significant start up capital.
Depends also what you mean by large scale capital....VCs will make $30-50mm investments often....and more if needed.   (Not in Bitcoin yet but that's a function of the new market, not the VCs)
For that the key is a REALLY good team and a really solid plan.....also case studies, surveys, data, partners etc.   For a big startup, these costs could be $500k to $1 mm or so just to make a great plan.
So for example if you had a business idea that is awesome and disruptive and solves a problem but can only be implemented if it's done on a huge scale like FedEx then you'd need an awesome team of five or so really serious people....like SVPs from Google or MSFT or something.....you could get signed agreements from potential partners --- if you got a Wal Mart or something your plan is far along toward a done deal....also market research and pre-sold customers.
A lot of this can be accomplished with elbow grease.

I would definitely hope I would be smart enough to not make such an estimate – – because I would most certainly be roughly sketched
I would tell them “we have absolutely no idea where this will go, it is going to be a rocky road, it is going to be extremely volatile, but if you believe in the overall concept and you believe in Bitcoin we’re going to do our best to buy it at as cheap as possible price in order to execute this”
Then, for implementation I would try to execute it over a period of time and basically be targeting a dollar cost average of something slightly lower than the average trading price per day – – but even that is wrought with much peril – – would also be good to acquire some large blocks off market of course and in some cases that can be done at a discount, in other cases it might need to be done at a premium

Stock quotes used to be delivered like this -- a ticker tape -- in the 70s and 80s a primary method of getting quotes for brokers was the newspaper.
In the early 90s it was still common for customers to call brokers for real time quotes....which the broker would get off a Quotron machine which cost $800 / mo per user and took about 2 seconds to retrieve a quote.
Every month we'd get an updated "symbol book" - a book of all stock symbols by name -- which was the only was you would know that Microsofts symbol was MSFT unless you had it memorized.
If you wanted to know past earnings etc. it was all hard copy -- if your firm didn't have a copy of the annual report then you called investor relations on the phone and had one mailed to you.
Then one day in 1993 or so they came in and replaced the Quotrons with PCs hooked up to a special system which allowed us to look up stock prices, track performance AND use Lotus 123 and WordPerfect all on the same machine!   There was of course no web browsing and no email unless you also owned your own PC which you could run Prodigy on.

Well BitInstant never sold Bitcoin -- they enabled people to buy coins from Gox, so that's one extra space removed....also, the guy BTC Kimg sold them on SR....to other people which, in and of itself means nothing as far as illegal purchases....it's very possible that someone on SR could decide not to make a purchase....granted IF they got coins on SR and IF they spent the it is likely they bought drugs (although I believe 10-20% of products on SR were legal ones)
IF the complaint is accurate it would mean that Shrem failed to file a suspicious activity report.  He hasn't had his day in court yet and he contests the charges --- there are many ways emails can be taken out of context etc.
But suppose it's accurate.   Is that a violation?  Sure.  Do you think my local bank manager, if she failed to file a SAR would be handcuffed with press and threatened with 10 years in Federal prison?  Nah.  More likely an audits warning.  If dealing with millions in cartel money then a fine (as has happened).   My problem is the inordinate amount of attention paid to this by the state and the fact that his case has been held up as some kind of poster child of why we need regulation.

So -- if someone comes to your home and says "I don't agree with your marriage / raw milk drinking / food choices" or "I want some of your money, give it to me" ......"if you refuse I will threaten you with a gun, handcuffs and placing you in a cage"
You don't feel that is a violent act?
Think it through.  Do you really think that threatening someone if they don't submit to going in a cage is not violent? Caging a human against his will and by threat is not violent?
A THREAT in and of itself is violent.  If a person tells you they will tie you up (or handcuff you) if you don't do what they say, that is violent.  If someone says they will harm you or place you in a cage, that is violent.
These are violent acts.   You can say you think they are worthwhile anyway, you agree with them etc. etc. but I don't see how anyone can say they are not violent acts or that because the violence is committed by the state the definition of the word violent somehow changes.

Dice rolls are not as random as they may seem.  Especially using side sided dice added together because it creates a bell curve where 5,6 and 7 are far more likely than 1s and 12s --- it's not an equal chance to get each number from 1-12.
Best bet is to use 10 sided role playing game dice.
Edit: I know a lot of people know this already but I've heard of some using 2 six sided dice added.

And by the way the reason my OP wasn't "Mark was a total liar to me" is because I don't know that for sure.   Sadly it seems increasingly likely by the day that the coins are indeed gone but he was unclear on this in his press conference, unclear on how many and it's clouded further by his earlier statement of saying they are "temporarily inaccessible".   It is possible that the coins are still in possession of Gox and this issue is a combination of bad PR, a gag order, seizure by govt, elaborate tech issue, missing key etc.

That's exactly the point.....all of us are worried about regulations we don't even know what they are yet.
ALL the time in heavily regulated industries, the regulators inconsistently and arbitrarily apply new interpretations of regulations.
I've seen regulators SEVERAL times get confused about two different terms....look at Bitcoin Foundation, they got a letter from the State of California warning them about being a "money transfer agent".
I don't trust at all that if I opened an exchange I would be safe from prosecution for any number of a dozen regulations which I'm not aware of and my legal council are unable to determine due to lack of clarity.  When I ask the lawyers they advise not to do such things because of exactly these risks.

Not really - IMHO.
First off -- the tech is new.  It sounds great to say "lets decentralize everything and turn it into a Decentralized Autonomous Corporation and run it on the blockchain"
However there are a couple challenges with that --  two organizations I'm involved with, Bitcoin Association and Global Bitcoin Alliance have worked to move towards that.   But the devil is in the details --- HOW exactly can this be done effectively and do we have a model of an organization who has done so?   We know the answer to the second part, no one has done so, just yet.
Another thing worth noting is that SOME things are better done through a centralized organization -- if for no other reason than because that is what much of the rest of the world is used to interacting with.  
So, for example, one thing the Foundation does is recommend speakers when media and other groups ask for one --   someone could replace this by making a new service, but to make it decentralized might be more effort than it is worth.

Its not self-aggrandizing. 
Its a simple fact that you are completely mistaken about how the regulations work and so obsessed with your logical fallacy of strawman attack versus Rand Paul (who, by the way I am not) that you are unable to accept reality.
You have a fundamental lack of understanding how self regulatory bodies work and the fact that they are not optional and that following the rules IS indeed the law.
I point out that I've got a few credentials on this to save you further embarrassment --  its really obvious that you are not an attorney, not a regulator, not someone who has ever held a compliance or supervisory role in this industry so I'm not going to waste time arguing with you about something you are so baffling incorrect about.   Its really odd that you would argue with someone on a topic you know very little about.
If you are so sure about yourself put some money up:  we'll both put 25 Bitcoins in escrow and if you can produce an opinion letter from a law firm that says that FINRA rules are not enforced by law then I give my coins to Seans Outpost -if you cant, you do.

We have a big problem with laws with "indirect victims".  In many cases rne victim ends up being someone who is prosecuted by the law.   Who was harmed most in Charlie Shrem's case?  Charlie.  No other person was harmed.
If we talk about indirect victims then we get into this situation where we prosecute a guy who sold Bitcoin to another guy who sold them to another guy....whi then sold them on Silk Road to buy drugs...which was a voluntary peaceful transaction between willing people.   So under the (incorrect) theory that drugs cause violence (in reality outlying drugs causes more violence) we end up prosecuting someone who harmed no one.

TLDR:  Regulation comes from violence not competence or strength of it's ideas.
Lawsky was not elected and has no mandate to do so from the people.
The regs contain insanely onerous proposals like no creation of alt coins without a license and no ability to associate with Blockchain.
Given that Lawsky has demonstrably lied to our community he appears to be acting in bad faith and is also corrupt.
We should therefor engage with others who are more reasonable and those wanting to be part of the political process should focus on elected officials and positive ideas.

I would love to say yes, but the answer in truth, is no, unfortunately – – 
Classic banks are a very herd mentality type of bunch and tradition bound – – it is extremely unlikely that any executive or leader would have the courage and foresight to do something so bold – – even if they did there are power structures such as the board and others involved which would probably not allow it, even if it was the very top manager/the CEO – – there are essentially no banks that are owned by a single individual who would be able to make such a move.
Even worse – – unfortunately even if they didn’t do such a thing the regulatory issues surrounding it an actual ability to logistically implemented would probably be insurmountable

It's not too hard.
I'm not much of an advocate, due to time but it's not really hard to make a difference.
Government works for the people and needs to be reminded of this sometimes.
There are people way better at it than me but I'd probably do something like what I did when Swampscott MA Selectman Barry Greenfield said he wanted police to do mandatory home inspections for firearms compliance..... 
Within 5 hours I had it covered by Fox national, and every single local media, I set up a campaign which resulted in him getting hundreds of phone calls and thousands of emails --- the story was viewed 750,000 times on social media and by that Monday he apologized and retracted his statement. 
Same when my town wanted to keep $1.5 million in beach sticker revenue despite the beach being closed - I got 600 resident signatures and showed up with the signatures and 20 volunteers and four news media to the town managers office within 18 hours then went on TV talking about it -- within a couple days they had a special town meeting and retracted the decision and offered a refund to everyone who wanted it.
These kind of things are not too hard, easier if you have a few Facebook connections  - I have a couple on my page brucefentonpage who read my posts sometimes, so that gives a head start.
There are some great people who do this type of thing often and effectively who serve as an inspiration.

Not sure if you posted this as a counter or in support of the post.
I don't read this as something which in any way allows Gox to access customer coins for the purpose of a mandatory venture capital investment in future expansion of the company.
The second part does not apply to the 200,000 coins they DO STILL HAVE -- those coins are clearly customer coins and one would have a very hard time making the argument that customers should have known from the TOS that Gox executives could seize their coins for experimental ventures and expansion.....in fact I don't think any Gox customer thought that to be the case.
The first part of this statement applies.  Gox must hold those 200,000 coins in member accounts -- and must allow them access to those funds.
To claim anything else would be likely criminal and at the very least would be unethical and dishonest to a baffling level.

Even if the corporate money did go to the customers and no other creditor (it wouldn't) and even if there were no legal fees etc....that $10 million is not even 1% of the value of missing coins.
Do you not understand that if there is not a plan like this there will be NO recovery and no effort at all to find the stolen coins?    The 10% doesn't go to them it would be a bounty/ fee for someone who found it such as a tipster or investigator firm.   For that amount, the top detective agencies, hackers, security experts in the world would be hounding the thief until the ends of the ear forever.

Did Andreas change his name to "Kevin Antonopulos"?
This post scores some cheap upvotes for the "gotcha" / cleverness factor -- but there is no indication that Andreas even saw this.   The implication seems to be that he shouldn't be spending time on a book (which looks like it will be excellent) because it distracts from his security work.   That doesn't seem reasonable.
Now you could argue that he should see every email which is related to security which goes to the inbox or you could reach out to him with the issue.....but attacking him related to his book is a cheap shot.
He has done a lot for Bitcoin and this kind of thing is perhaps one reason that some of the prominent voices no longer post here on Reddit.
My suggestion would have been a private message:
"Hey Andreas - here's a possible vulnerability, not sure if you saw it or are aware of my note"
"hey - not sure if your generic bug report feature automatically goes to the Chief of Security for the whole company but it should"
If that didn't work Tweet him and if that didn't work then post on Reddit but leave the attack of his book out of it.  It's not relevant and is a cheap shot.

The guide you posted includes comments as well -- look at my comments -- not at all self promotional.
The Reddit guide is also very clearly talking about advertising, affiliate links, products etc. something where someone is encouraging an action not simply sharing content.
Otherwise the policy would extent to self posts and imgur because someone who posted popular content could be considered self promotional if they had a lot of self posts - especially if they were popular.
If it's "annoying and detrimental" why not use the downvote system?  Sorry I don't control the votes - if people agreed with you I'd have negative feedback, very simple.  Look at the actual guide for mods on what is spam.
What exact action do you suggest?   
Not post stuff if it's unique?
Sometimes the content I post is stuff no one else can post --- when I was in Dubai and met the guy with the ATMs, people want to know about it -- when I was one of the only ones to talk to Mark K during the Gox meltdown, people want to know that.   How do I know they want to know?   Because Reddit has a system called upvoting and downvoting and people can vote for whatever they want.
You are suggesting that I don't post something like the Dubai or Gox info for Reddit?    It seems a more sensible system is to let Reddit votes, not concern if I am being self promotional decide what's worthwhile.
I still don't know what on earth I'd be "self promoting" -- I don't sell a product any Reddit person could buy, I don't do paid speaking gigs, sell books, sell ads etc. what would I be promoting people to do?  What would be my end goal?

I say they get that right from creating it -- same as if they create a table from a pile of wood they own.
I guess I don't see it as getting rid of the property.  I think creators should have total control over their works.  If a poet says they only want Morgan Freeman to be allowed to recite the poem in public and no one else should that should be their right.   If George RR Martin says no cartoons can be made of his work that should be his right also.
One crux of the issue we might disagree on is in whether copying is harmful.  It seems you might be coming from the angle that it doesn't harm them therefor we should be allowed to.   If so, a couple points - one is that some would argue that it takes revenue they could have had if they had sold the work--    I think more important than this is simply that creators should have control -- in the poetry example or whatever - creative people have all kinds of quirks and idiosyncrasies --- even if something doesn't hurt them in our opinion then it may bother them.   JRR Tolkien had an unauthorized copy of Lord of the Rings changes elves to "elfs" and it made him furious because he felt very strongly that "elves" was the correct way.   
Alan Moore who created Watchmen, V for Vendetta and League of Extraordinary Gentlemen hates movies- he won't allow his name to be used on them and new works he makes have provisions making it so no one can make films from his stuff (the older works I just mentioned were made by DC comics who sold the film rights).   Moore actually turned down millions of dollars for this.   This doesn't make sense to a lot of people but he's a creative genius and that should be his right.   IMHO 
It's an interesting topic

"we all know the allegations of fraud from his past ventures"
We do?
All I know of is one ridiculous lawsuit which looks like it was written by an 8th grader and accusations that he knew a guy who hung around with Bryan Singer the director who was accused of impropriety and had those accusations were proven false.
So basically Brock:
1) got sued by a disgruntled former employee
2) knew a guy who knew a guy who was falsely accused of something
If you have more to it please post the actual court cases, eh at crimes you actually claim he was convicted of and the actual court documents related to them.

Well the two businesses he was alluding to are -
1) a credit card which will be backed by Bitcoin not cash and usable anywhere credit cards can be used
2) a business which will back Bitcoin with metals....this exists, Joseph, who introduced him, serves as sort of a metal backer for anyone who wants to trade Bitcoin for metal.....this answers the question "is bit coin backed by anything?"   In some cases, yes
I have an okay / basic understanding of Joseph's business model but not at a level enough where I'd feel comfortable explaining it in more detail on Reddit since I might make a mistake in explaining it or might misunderstand it .....but I think I captured the basics above

Sorry Reddit but an AMA is a show where the host can pick and choose answers and can craft and tailor responses with the help of staff.
It has little substance or help and even can be counter productive because it gives enemies of Bitcoin a press release opportunity to say "we looked at both sides".

For corruption I take you you are talking about use of blockchain tech in developing markets to track where funds go.  This is a great use case -- but rhe foundation has to prooritize.  Right now the focus should be on core Dev and, in my opinion global regulatory issues and educstion of lawmakers.

Its not that I dislike sarcasm but find that it is a common tool by people on social media when they really cant argue based on logic and facts --- so they use the logical fallacy of a strawman to twist the argument and say "oh sure it would be great if ____"  usually filling the blank with something that is not the OPs argument. 
Its the same technique Jon Stewart and Bill Maher use but its not really honest and certainly not productive.
Why not say "No Bruce, sanctions brought Vietnam and North Korea to the table and this benefits humanity"?
Because then, as a factual statement its a lot easier for me as the other side to say "Prove it" "What informs that opinion" or to point out why its simply wrong (like that sanctions where not what brought N Vietnam to the table and N Korea hasn't even come to the table)
Stating that one doesn't believe sanctions work is hardly pie in the sky anarchism.  The evidence is pretty compelling and many people involved in foreign policy agree.  I'm friends with Dr. John Duke Anthony - one of the most knowledgeable people about Mid East policy in the world -  he thinks the Iran sanctions are harmful.   You roll your eyes based on what argument?
On a more practical logical and simple level -- think about this ---  the US government had World of Warcraft delete the accounts of a huge number, perhaps millions of Iranians who played the game.  Can any logical person think that all these Iranians went out and said that the US had done a good thing and they should change their government.
Cuba has had sanctions since before I was born and they have only made Cuba more bull headed.

Is it limited only to certain companies who use certain language on the site?  Is it subject to a vote by the board?  By members?

One thing people sometimes miss about dollar cost averaging is that it works two different ways depending on whether it's an alternative to a lump sum or an investment which was already going to be periodic.
The mistake is that people think that DCA will outperform a lump sum.   In volatile investments which appreciate a great deal, lump sum is often the better bet.

Ideally the buyer would be someone with no good reputation and they'd trust me (a little) -- we'd out the Bitcoin in escrow with a law firm (making sure it's a good, solid, large, national firm) then release the title to the owner.

For tax implications I'd report the Bitcoin as sale proceed --- I don't see any other legal issue.

No...it's almost all government required.
The Securities Exchange Commission and various Fed laws like the Securities Act, the investment Company Act of 1940 etc. establish self regulatory bodies like FINRA.  
Mano mistake FINRA IS A REGULATOR AND COMPLIANCE IS NOT OPTIONAL --  if someone operates while simply ignoring FINRA and never registering then they are absolutely in violation of serious criminal statutes and they will be caught and probably do jail time.
If a firm engages in sale of securities they MUST be registered and if they are registered the MUST follow the rules.
Most of these are covered under the FINRA manual "communications with the public" -- I put them as examples because they are easy to understand.
Everything on this list is a LAW for reps, not an optional corporate thing (with the exception of whether or not they will allow you to use social media and what specific 'outside business activities' they will approve)

By far, the biggest misconception is that people think that it is all about going through financial exercises like you would in a financial college class – – in the reality of the investment business people skills, sales skills, interpersonal relations and management are far more important.
What separates the lead investment professionals who make $100,000 a year from those who make $10 million per year is very rarely the ability of one to do spreadsheets better than the other one – – and almost always relates to that person’s connections, ability to convey ideas and their ability to work with people

As for regulation and what FINRA has promulgated -- clearly you don't have any understanding how these things work.   They have an entire manual online with thousands of items covered.   If a rep break any of those he has broken the law.
Also, State regulators (like Lawsky) can simply make regulations without having them go to court.

Are you honestly saying that there are NOT regulators and people even in our own community and even on this sub if not this post who don't want Bitcoin regulated the same way as FINRA?????

A year is like 10 years in Bitcoin time..... but overall I cant imagine suddenly kicking out our very earliest supporters in a year if they didnt pay.

So strange how little understanding there is of this.
The proposal is 
1--  Japanese court sells the 200,000 coins, someday pays back the customers with whatever is left after fees, legal costs etc.
OR (this proposal)
2-   This company takes over what's left of Gox, gives out the 200,000 coins to customers immediately AND launches an investigation into what happened to the rest AND gives customers equity in the new business 
Those are your main choices

Depends who it's compared to -- what I mean by this is that I have personally placed, raised or invested about $4.5 - $5 billion in investment funds.   
I know some people who have decent careers and have never broken $100 mm.   There are major PE and hedge fund guys who have done significantly more.
I use that metric because AUM is not relevant for me.   I used to directly have $500 mm under management as a classic financial advisor / broker but I don't have that model any more and have not for years.
My main clients now are a tiny handful of extremely large organizations with hundreds of billions between them.... The sometimes used term "assets under advisory" is a BS term IMHO -- if I have a Forbes member client who has me hedge mahogany versus pine for his log cabin widgets and pays me $100k for a $10 mil piece of business do I get to count my "assets under advisory" by his net worth of $3 billion?    I think no, that's phony, but TONS of firms do so.
This is best measure I can think of -- I also disclose my clients when talking face to face but sure as heck not on Reddit.  :)

Well how do you propose that Bitcoin grow to the $400 Bn the Winkelgoss targeted (assuming you want it to grow) -- without intersecting with the place where all the money now is?
If the ATMs convert $1000 worth of fiat to coins per minute it would take 7600 years so that's one option. 
You think no one in the investment business adds any value?   The execs at Facebook, Google, Amazon and every single other major growth company without exception were all fools for working with those sleazy venture capitalists?   They are all even bigger fools now for working with 'the man' by being on an exchange?

It means that there are 200,000 coins left -that's about 25% of the pre-theft amount -- if you had 10 coins you'd get 25% or 2.5 coins.
If you had 100 coins you'd get 25 coins.

Your contention is that it is legal, fair and moral for a company to seize customer assets for the purpose of expansion or a mandatory experimental venture investment.
Maybe -- I don't think so and I can't imagine anyone running a Bitcoin exchange under the presence that Bitcoin is not a real asset subject to the same laws as everything else.   Client assets are separate from custodian assets -always in every country there is some rule to this effect which protects people in every type of transaction from bank deposits to parking garages to pawn shops--- the financial stability of the one temporarily holding the asset is irrelevant to the asset itself.
You contend that a Coinbase tomorrow could suddenly decide to take 26% of the coins on deposit and buy a fleet of Ferraris and that would be legal and moral?   I really am surprised there is any discussion about this and that people honestly think that.  Customer assets are property of the customers, period.  Bitcoin are assets.  It's very simple.  
You don't give up ownership of an asset because you deposit it elsewhere -- you give up control,muse, but not ownership.   
This is why Bitcoin is not on the balance sheet of any exchange

It's more complex than that -- I don't see the Skandinavian countries as massive clear successes -- they have thier share of problems as well.
I'm not happy with most governments in the world right now -  many have aspects we can learn from:  Singapore and UAE, especially Dubai are business friendly and UAE has open immigration -- Portugal has better drug laws than most, UK has good police accountability in some ways, rule of law and general speech freedoms (but it's declining), US has good personal protection laws in most states and some of the best land ownership/ property rights in the world, Thailand has a lot of personal freedom, New Zealand has a decent foreign policy - several jurisdictions have low or no taxes.  
The ideal country would combine all these things.  Closest might be the US some years back but it's hard to say....many factors are involved and some things outweigh others.   I helped Saudi Arabia make reforms to make it more business friendly and free -- they lept forward in the ease of doing business rankings from something like  to  they improved in areas like allowing foreign ownership of businesses and set up time...problem is that it doesn't count things like women being able to drive and entire banned sectors.
Adoption:  I'd like to see it faster of course but I have a lot of faith in all these increasingly better funded teams like Circle and Bitpay.  One of the biggest drivers I think will be once Winklevoss or Silbert have an accessible Bitcoin vehicle -- this will drive price which in turn drives stability as well as interest and therefor adoption.

I don't like to assume it's inevitable.  Just because the government has continued to make terrible mistakes is not reason enough to assume they should continue.
If we must have regulation then I'd like to see simple clarity and regulations which allow the free market to solve problems.
Also regulators could work with enforcement officials to have better enforcement of existing laws against fraud and theft.   For example, most police will not investigate a theft of Bitcoin -- it would be an improvement if they would.

It was dumb 10 posts ago.
The Feds actually had a bill up a while ago to stop state regulators from duplicating SEC and other functions and to get rid of state securities regulators entirely   (if you look at the websites of the state securities people they essentially never catch anyone committing a crime that FINRA or SEC didnt catch first ....seriously, almost never --  in Mass, a large popluation state it was something like 12 cases last year alleging a few million in fraud (and taxpayers paid probably 10 times that for the army of laywers etc for crimes which would have been caught by FINRA or SEC)
Anyway --  the state politicians resisted the measure to get rid of themselves, no surprise.
By the way, I also dont have a problem with the SEC --- could use some reform but in general they tend to only bug people when there is good reason

Well that's why I'm wondering if he said "800,000 coins" or "coins"
I've seen both translations --- some of the forensic analysis seems to indicate, as you've said, they've been there since 2011 
Others seem to indicate that at least 90,000 coins was robbed for sure.
One (optimistic) theory:    Mark is over his head, lost 90,000 coins to fraud, business falling apart -- the others are gummed up in some system that has disconnected them from client accounts or something but still exist and he feels he can save the day if he can just do a but more coding....he is under promising and over-delivering by saying "coins are gone" -- let people assume the worst but not outright stating that 800,000 are gone....then he hopes to salvage some of his reputation by later announcing he has the key.   This would be a bad PR idea but that wouldn't be surprising,
Just a theory....optimistic to be sure.
But,as I'm sure you agree, he didn't seem like a guy who had lost 800,000 coins in manner, communication or action.   The whole thing just doesn't make sense and there is definitely some piece of this story that we do not yet have.    
Could he have been threatened and made to give up the coins?  Did he lose the keys and is so profoundly embarrassed he wants to place blame?   1000 other possibilities ....but "disappeared" becomes a less and less valid excuse ever coin over a balance one one or so.

Interesting you mention that.
1) I highly doubt it
2) a GCC wide currency is hampered by rough relations with Qatar in the last year 
3) amazingly there ARE people in government in the GCC who DO want to issue an Auroracoin like crypto currency and are very friendly to and familiar with the concept
4)  IMHO the only way a government or regional issued currency would be worthwhile would be if it was decentralized or had other very appealing features such as being backed by gold
5). What I'd really like to see a few countries do is embrace Bitcoin as a currency

Fair enough -- for this purpose the definition of harm would be something along the lines of someone injuring, killing, threatening or taking property from another.   This is pretty consistent with things I say pretty often.
I've used exactly the same argument for those who say gay marriage harms them -- I say tough, it doesn't meet the above definition- gay marriage does not hurt you physically, kill you or take your property.
Issues where people feel "harmed" that do not fall under the definition are issues with those people and their own problem, for right or wrong.
I've said things many times like "no one has a right to do violence another unless in defense or if that person has done violence to them or taken their property"
I think there pretty consistent.  It's really whether you consider IP property or not

So you think it's BETTER for us if each person who works in sales for Bitpay and Coinbase has to be licensed in each state before they talk to a new potential client there?
You think it would be an improvement if all speakers at all Bitcoin conferences had to have their remarks approved beforehand by a compliance department and regulator?
You think it would help Bitcoin companies grow if each employee had to report all social media and were essentially banned from forums like this?
Think it through.   Massive downside and this is exactly why we've seen so few innovations in financial and banking sectors and they are dominated by old players who've mastered the game.
With laws one should not need to prove that they don't work....regulators should have to prove that they do work before taking freedom from millions of others.

If by in charge you mean as Exec Director -  I cant rule out anything for all of history but can say that right now I cannot foresee anything which would make me seek that position.  I have no interest or ambition to be the ED at all in any way.
How can you be sure I am not running for personal gain?   Well I think most people do things for personal gain --not all of this is bad - if can be for their own idea of fun, fulfillment or for connections etc.
The personal gain I would possibly gain from this would be an increase in connections in the Bitcoin space.
To be more specific - if your question is how might I gain in a way which is bad for the foundation?  I would intend to work with a high degree of transparency and high ethical standards.
I am from a Wall Street / banking background.  Some old timers will remember when that alone was enough to make me a hated "suit wearing" person to be shunned.   But within this space I've always been an outlier.  I was a very vocal opponent of the TARP bailouts for example --  and although to the outside world I may seem to be one of the cigar smokers at the table -- I am hardly in line with most of what we call Wall Street.

And how about the regulators in New York using Charlie Shrem as a rally cry for why more regulation is needed -  was this also a straw man?
My post did cover it - I said "Most regulation does not stop a worthwhile amount of fraud and theft but it does to a good deal of harm to innovation."
If you dont agree, prove it -  go to the website of the NY regulators for example and get the list of people they have been involved in arresting and charging with crimes....its very easy to do.  Its also very easy to determine the overall costs of regulation and compliance.  Take the two together and make a case of how the former could be worth the latter.

When Bernie Maddof was Chairman of NASDAQ it was prior to the split of NASD and Nasdaq and renaming to FINRA.
At this time Nasdaq was the lead regulator and self regulatory body for all stockbrokers and investment firms in the US including Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley where I used to work.
I was a NASD (later known as FINRA) General Securities Principal and Supervisor for 18 years and registered as a stockbroker / Registered Rep for 20 years and was regulated by the agency headed by Mr. Maddof.  I worked for Morgan Stanley then founded my own firm.
I'm pretty familiar with who regulated me and my employees.

From a practical standpoint I don't think its super effective to run for the board of something for the purpose of attempting to disband it.  Cody has a gift for reaching people, a keen mind and is creative and a lover of liberty.  I think his efforts could be more productive elsewhere.

It's hard to estimate exactly -- but here are a couple things to note.
The $27 billion in total transactions is very different from online sales.   Bitpay is not processing $2.7 billion yet for example.
The other thing is the total size of money needed to come to $262 billion.
If we got to the stage whwre Bitcoin was being used for real live purchases of $2.7 billion that's a lot more than now and would be a big deal.
There is a formula which estimates how much money needs to exist to do a certain number of transactions --- but I don't have it handy.
(For example for X transactions to be made there needs to be X * Y amount of total money in the system.... For the the online example....for us to get to $262 billion in volume the aggregate of consumers need to own more than that....)
TLDR:  it's not super easy to estimate but it's a lot
I prefer the more simple and straight forward examples of if all of the Bitcoin on earth becomes worth as much as the stock of Apple.....with that we can peg an exact price target.. But of course market cap of a company is different than a currency -- I still think it's valid because it shows how much the overall capital markets value it

Within a year, somewhere in the world we are going to have a teller window that looks just like the money changer windows in airports and cities all over the world.
In that little room will sit a guy or woman with a computer and a calculator and a safe and there will be a little screen on the wall which says the value of Bitcoin that moment.
You'll be able to give the cashier a big ole pile of Euros or dollars or Riyals and he will accept tour cash, then take an paper wallet envelope out of a little lock box, charge it, let you double check it and give it back to you or will give you the option of doing so directly via your phone app.
Just like you can change dollars for Euros without ID you'll be able to do this without ID.

The clearest way I can explain it is that if you had fiat cash only at Gox you will likely never see it again no matter what the options are.
Under liquidation you might theoretically have a tiny bit higher chance for the reason you mentioned (liquidating everything) -- but under the SaveGox you'd have equity and be dealing with a company rather than a long government run court process.
I'm biased toward the SaveGox plan because I think that would help the most people recover the most money and would be best for Bitcoin.  I also think it would be the best chance at finding what happened to the assets.
@_date: 2014-12-31 14:28:28
Thanks for the question.
I think some of the problems with weath concentration in capitalism are cases like Batista in Cuba or what we are starting to see in the US:  not really capitalism at all but corporatism / cronyism....so I'm not convinced the evidence is that string if we are talking about real capitalism.
But yes, it is a problem.   This goes into your next point about the ideal system -- we should remember that all systems have a drawback and, so far, no one has discovered a perfect system.
We also should be careful to compare apples to apples : there are many factors contributing to an economy:  demographics/ age of citizens, geographic location, educstion levels, history, natural resources, historical relations with others, the global economic environment etc.  But when all else is equal I think that a more free system is better...it's not without its drawbacks though.
Regarding adoption: I think Bitcoin wants to grow exponentially- I see a lot of similarities to the web -- opportunities exist all over the world and in making the tech easier etc.  Just 20 months or so ago we had to meet people in coffee shops or send money to Dwolla then to Japan to Mt Gox to buy coins -- now we have Circle and can buy them in 90 seconds with a credit card, it's amazing.  We are (hopefully) at a stage where we have passed the initial interest/ buzz/ trial and are building some massive infrastructure and a solid base which is scalable and can take us through the next major run of adoption -- and, included in this, price increase -- which is significant because a larger overall capitalization of Bitcoin will very likely increase stability in price --- which is a major drawback to daily use and adoption for many.

Yes, this was the article by Ken Hess and the challenger was Erik Voorhees.  I offered to pay Ken Hess's airfare to come debate Erik.
1-  Good use of resources -- Yes!  Especially since I didn't have to pay.  Haha.   To be honest I thought it would be unlikely that Ken would agree to come -- since he didnt agree it cost me nothing so was a great bit for free buzz for the conference.  
Had he said yes -- it would have cost me about $1500 or so - not a ton relative to a conference marketing budget ---  now one school of thought says that its crazy to reward a jackass with a free flight.  But as a conference organizer --- suppose we sold only a few extra seats or we got more buzz on the video and were known next year --- I think financially it would have been worth it.  This amount was not large enough that it would harm me much either way and I really thought it would be fun to see.   So me doing so as the organizer is a bit different than me just randomly paying some guy to go some random place.
My San Fran speech on Lawsky was seen 90,000 times on YouTube --  I didn't pay anything for that but I think its worthwhile publicity wise.  If I can spend a Bitcoin here or there to help with publicity I will.
2)  It depends on the case -- sometimes it makes sense to ignore them -- sometimes if they are high profile and really wrong its worth setting them straight.  I ignore most -- but a good debate can help people think.

If I went to speak at the hearing I would be respectful, professional, understanding and empathetic and work hard to educate, enlighten and improve understanding.
But at the end of the day, if it comes to it, I would respectfully ask what moral right government has to tell me the manner I can speak or transmit math to another consenting human for value.
I have the right to transmit numbers just ask much as I have to sing a song or quote Shakespeare and frankly the regulators have absolutely no moral authority to threaten me with handcuffs and cages for speaking these numbers.

Freemasons are not centralized- just like Bitcoin so its hard to say "the freemasons".
I am a freemason and a member of Cornerstone Lodge in Massachusetts.  I own a facebook page which has 400,000 members called freemason page --  other admins do 99% of the posts these days.
Im not that active in the freemasons -  I havent held a leadership position and only attend a couple meetings a year.
Overall I think Bitcoin penetration with Freemasons is very, very low.  The demographics of the fraternity is one dominated by older men where Bitcoin is dominated by people in their late 20s or early 40s.
So basically, no --  you will see some individual freemasons integrate Bitcoin but there is almost nothing being done at any organizational level -- even if there was, there isn't much which could be done-  maybe collecting annual dues or something --  but I bet if the Grand Lodge accepted Bitcoin the number of freemasons who paid dues using Bitcoin would be about 5 in the country.

You call me a liar because you dug up a post where one month ago just as BTC withdrawal issues were becoming problematic I asked a question about a delay on a 0.03 BTC transaction.
I'm saying I moved my coins away other than a very tiny amount.  I'm also saying that this is hardly evidence worthy of an attack.  If so you could attack tens of thousands of other people including Erik Voohrees and others.

1) Roger isn't CEO of Blockchain.
2) 2013 is a lifetime ago in Bitcoin and Mt Gox time, vouching for cash in '13 doesn't give someone responsibility for what happened in '14
3) being in a place does not mean one is "hiding out" he has a busy schedule and I doubt people where exactly beating down his door in Japan making it necessary to "hide out"
4) In 2013 when there were problems with Gox, Roger, because he is trusted and knowledgeable in this community and happened to live next door in Shibuya, went to Marks office and reviewed Mark's books and he made the simple statement that Gox had lots of cash
5)  Even up to two weeks before the collapse, Mark and Gox were acting as if all was fine -- at that time I talked to Mark, Gongzague as well as Roger and others in this space -- I don't think Roger knew the extent of the problems -- many people were blindsided by the extent of the damage -- I don't think he vouched for anything other than the cash on the balance sheet in 2013 and it doesn't seem fair or reasonable at all to attack him on this -- no one asked for an audited statement and Roger is not an auidtor --- if he had said something in January like "I've had it proven that all coins are there" or something that is different but would likely mean he was conned like so many others, not guilty of something as this implies -  Roger has done well with Bitcoin and has many ventures going - he has no motivation to help a bad company  ---  
 he is a great asset to our community IMHO

Bitcoin could be a major part of global finance.  But it is an experiment and this is all uncharted territory, this has never happened before -- so we cannot know for sure what will happen in the future.

Since this is new, something we have not conceived of could destroy Bitcoin and bring th value to zero.

Inclusive doesn't mean skipping a place just because a lot of rich people live there....if we did we'd have to skip California, NY and Germany also!
Most people in Middle East are not ultra rich....also we will draw people from nearby Pakistan, India etc.

Judging from the comments, some people may not know what "pro rata" means.  
It means proportional -- as in if you held 100 coins at Mt. Gox then you'd get 25 coins back immediately (from the 200,000 coins) AND you would ALSO get some equity in the company.
You would ALSO have the firm doing an extensive investigation into the other stolen coins.
THAT is what this option is.
THE OTHER main option is to let the coins be liquidated for Yen and maybe you get some someday when the case is resolved and the distributions are made....but you definitely would not get any equity in anything and would never find out where the other coins went, much less recover them.
Please may like or dislike details of this but there are not exactly a plethora of great options as alternatives.   The situation is a bad one for those who had coins at Gox....this might be one of the ways to make it a little less bad.
Those criticizing should stick to alternatives that are actually real and actionable viable options now: alternative plans, liquidation or whatever --- it does no good to focus on plans which have no chance of being implemented or are not on the table.

I disagree with Charlie Lee that we "want" regulation.
Charlie comes with a strong tech background but from an unregulated industry.  He is not used to dealing with regulation.
When he asks for regulation I don't know if he realizes the pain and harm this will cause.
He is right that we need clarity so innovators don't find out in three years that the govt considers so,etching they did to then be wrong.
But from a regulation standpoint, no we do not need anything other than laws to protect a clear victim.

Not really.   People don't tend to think that just because government regulates something that it's legitimate....in fact some think the opposite.
The internet was distrusted early on...many speculated that people would never use a credit card online..... early web merchants relied on phone call ins for payment.
The trust didn't come from regs.
Meanwhile the regulations can be very harmful.

Happy to speak by phone -- I've had some similar discussions.
Main things are to anticipate common questions -- these will likely range from pretty sophisticated to pretty basic.
Stay in target -- try not to get off on a tangent about someone who is obsessing about mining or who Satoshi is or something else which isn't as relevant to your topic.
Use the internet as an example and how things unfolded.   Be sure to cover the big names who are in this space.
Right upfront it's also key to note that this is more than a currency-- it's an idea and an invention-- the Blockchain is here to stay.
If they say no you can always walk and start your own business.

We see these posts often about Circle, Coinbase and others.
Not speaking for them -- I am betting that the executives at these companies would like nothing more than to have a system that does this rapidly, seamlessly and using internal controls.
Reality is, they must comply with many regulations from muliple sources.

Charlie,  like you I've talked to Mark over the last couple weeks and like you, up until recently I thought he had the coins.
I haven said much on it publicly out of respect for privacy of Mark in was was not a public conversation.
But...do you think it's possible he is just trying to buy some time and really does have the coins and wants to "fix" things and come back as a white night saving the day?
He seemed very focused on rolling up his sleeves and fixing things -- programming wise or whatever.
In my conversations with them I am puzzled because they were not the conversations of someone who had no coins....unless they just didn't realize how serious that was.   I dunno.  So strange.   It would have made more sense if he simply fled or something.  
I also have a hard time thinking that 800,000 coins can vanish....  did he actually SAY 800k in Japanese?   (Or is that just the number thrown around from the memos)
What are the logistics of not noticing that they were gone?   How quickly were they taken?   Was it a matter of someone else gaining control of keys he had?   What manner of thief would be so bold as to not stop after 100k or so?
So many questions.

You said that just because one industry has bad regs doesn't mean Bitcoin would also....I'm saying that there are regulators right now who do want it to be exactly like the other areas of financial services.

The Congressional seat would have cost a lot of money and I would have run as a liberty republican.  In Massachusetts the odds of winning as a republican are very low.  So I would have likely spent six months or more and lost out on work and spent a lot of money for a very low chance of winning.   
I thought was that it might be worthwhile if I could present ideas of liberty, freedom and peace --- to challenge my opponent on war and the failed drug war etc.  But realistically Congressional races do not get much publicity.
What I offer the foundation -- I think -- is even headed thinking, a depth of experience in finance and global issues, a passion for Bitcoin and the technology and a drive to see this tech work.  I'm diplomatic and able to deal with a variety of people but also not afraid to stand up to enemies like Ben Lawsky.
What I expect to get out of it is the opportunity to meet people, learn more and be even more involved in this community.

I dont think its a joke or I wouldn't be involved.
From your comment I cant be sure what aspect of it is most "joke" like --   I think most agree that the core dev and work by Gavin and the others is serious work /no joke.
As far as the foundation itself I think the most joke-like event in my opinion was in having Mark Karpeles as a board member (and even having his cat listed as a member)  -  thats pretty joke-like/ embarrassing.    Mark K. was, at best a colossally incompetent manager of historically epic proportions.
This was compounded by other press at the time - 
I dont think the foundation can withstand an event like that very well.

I assume you are talking about one recently elected board member.  As far as I know these allegations turned out to be completely and totally false and ridiculous and this is a textbook case of attempted character assassination.
Furthermore, from what I understand, the accuser was a serial accuser who brought a series of lawsuits against people and recently not only had his case thrown out but was admonished by the judge.
It seems that movie director Bryan Singer was falsely accused and the case dismissed....our board member, was an associate of Singer and people made the leap of making accusations against him.
These are vile and terrible accusations of the worst kind.  As far as I know no one on the board has even been accused OR tried in court, much less convicted of such a crime.   Those involved in spreading these rumors need to absolutely produce legal evidence of a conviction or they should publicly apologize.  It is a great wrong to accuse someone of such a thing.
If anyone on the board or involved with the foundation was accused and convicted of a serious crime which had a clear victim I would call for them to resign.   This is completely not the case of what has happened.

I'd love to but I don't think it's very realistic right now where the price is and budget is. The foundation needs to be careful and cautious with resources.
There are clever ways to use a centralized pulpit though which don't cost money -- for example, crowdfunding or an organized effort to get Bitcoin featured (not paid) on a major news program etc.
We honestly don't need a foundation for such ventures, there are other ways they can be done but the foundation could possibly help facilitate or promote.

If the gains are "ill gotten" then the primary crime is the manner in which it was gotten, not the movement of money.
If someone steals then they should absolutely be prosecuted for that theft.  The mechanism they use to move money is no more at fault or in need of regulation than the car they used to get away or the phone they used to call an accomplice.

Businesses and people -- I would go further as to say that these regulations and the law should not exist at all in my opinion -- both the regs and 18-1956 should be done away with along with many other laws.
This seems radical to some -- but they are only seeing the intent of the law.  The intent of laws is rarely realized.  Not only does the "good" that is supposed to come from laws like this rarely pan out -- we see tons of unintended drawbacks and consequences.

Almost exact words within the draft I have now
@_date: 2014-04-18 23:12:59
The number is not exact.
I've heard him say it AND ALSO qualify the statement.
I think he says "the other six billion" as a figure of speech like "how the other half lives" or "other side of the tracks"
The accurate number is that 2-2.5 billion people have access to banks accounts as we know them --- we also should not count kids as even the riches kids don't have bank accounts anyway.
What we can say is that with certainty there are 2 billion adults who don't have access to bank accounts and there are 1 billion people who live on less than a dollar a day.
@_date: 2014-11-16 21:12:00
Okay, and WHO specifically at the foundation makes that call and what is the exact number?
This is why things sound great on Reddit "throw the bums out" ---  okay great, who exactly are the bad actors, who is responsible for deciding they are indeed bad and what is the procedure by which they do so.

This is one problem we see often  -- I might be one of the very most vocal anti-government / anti-Lawsky voices in the space (along with a handful of my friends) -- and your criticism is that I'm being too statist because I'm trying to reach people from a frame of understanding they can relate to.
It would be great to go into a normal room and convince everyone of the merits of Rothbard / NAP etc. But I've never been able to do so in one meeting and never even seen anyone do so.

@_date: 2014-12-30 04:33:07
Yes I recal the discussions and don't think we will agree.  I don't think that the act of copying in itself is necisarily stealing -- but I do believe
-  1) intellectual property is real property which can be owned -- this IP can be bought, sold, developed or created 
- 2) I think the owner of any piece of property has reasonable rights to decide how that property should be used -- I have the right as a land owner to say that people cannot camp or drive on my yard or cook in my kitchen without permission -- even if they argue that it does no harm -- I might be wrong, I might be a curmudgeon but that's my right as an owner of property
- 3) intellectual property is no different -- if I am the owner or creator of something then I have the right to say how it is used -- on my website you will notice that I provide permission for people to use my videos and articles with attribution Bank of America can use my videos because I said so, if I said no they should not be able to -- since I ask for attribution they do not have the right to say that thier Exec VP of tech made the video, just as you don't have the right to say you wrote Andreas's book  -- if I was JRR Tokliens estate I might not want John Doe to make Hobbit 3 before Peter Jackson --- I think George RR Martin has the right to release or not release his book and I don't think HBO would have had the right to simply take his book and make a movie without compensating him or getting permission --- it doesn't matter if we argue that copying is better for the artist or makes them more money or whatever --- property is the right of someone to use it how they see fit --- the "greater good" or "public need" arguments are no more valid for IP than they are for someone saying that grannie must sell her garden to Wal Mart or you must allow people to park on your yard.   
The argument that by copying the owner loses nothing is both irrelevant and untrue -- irrelevant because it's the owners right, not our right to decide whether they lose something or not -- there are works of writing and art that are highly personal -- people may have deep convictions about a Halliburton type of company using thier material -- or they may have a deeply personal poem, story or song which they would feel that delivery in a certain way was very harmful.  There are people who would give up all before seeing thier creation used in a way they did not want - it happens all the time.  Second, it's untrue because there very well can be harm to someone by copying if they believe it is harmful.  Al Pacino thinks if I released his private film its harmful, Eminem got so depressed at his album leak he almost quit music-- wanting it released on his own terms is his right.   It's also the right of a director to say his film can only be shown in certain quality theaters or a songwriter to say the song about their grandparent can only be sung at funerals....I do not have the right to turn that funeral song into a rap commercial for McDonalds. 
IP in my opinion is real property and that comes with rights of the owner of that property to do with it what they will whether we agree or not.   I do not believe we have any moral right to take the property of Eminem or George RR Martin or Stan Lee and use it in any way we want.   Creators do interesting things sometimes -- Alan Moore, who created Watchmen, V for Vendetta and League of Extrordinary Gentlemen doesn't like movies -- he won't allow his name to be used on movies and although his old work was sold to Holllywood by DC Comics, his newer work is more under his control and we are very unlikely to see a Tom Strong or Top 10 movie -- that is Moore's right as a creator.  Same with a private film Al Pacino made which he has never shown publicly -- he doesn't want it released other than to freinds.  That's his right, it's his property.

Option 1 - LIQUIDATION the remaining 200,000 coins are sold for Yen and the customers maybe get some someday, all records and computers are likely lost forever
Option 2 - REHAB PLAN - the new owners return all of the 200,000 coins to the customers and then work to investigate and provide transparency of what happened to the other coins and they also work to create a profitable exchange and pay back the remaining missing coins to customers

Don't lump everyone together, it's best to judge people by their actual actions.
Typically when people hate the investment business or bankers it's not for a specific reason but because they have anger.  If you think a specific person has done a specific wrong,say the crime and who....but even if you do I don't think you mean me.

Dear Reddit kid's Mom,
Bitcoin is an amazing invention and many of the top tech minds and venture capital investors believe it is one of the next biggest areas of job growth and is key to the future of economics and technology.
IMHO it is very healthy for young people to learn about new technologies and ideas.  Bitcoin is a tool just like the internet or phones and like any tool could be used for bad purposes. 
Despite the impression some have in the news media, the movement is overwhelmingly positive with some brilliant thinkers and leaders active in the space.
I'd urge you to explore this technology and encourage your child to do the same.  One great way is to attend a Bitcoin meetup or conference.   I'll even pay for your ticket for both of you.
Young people who learn about new technologies like this will have more chances for opportunity and critical thinking skills in the future.
Happy to answer any questions, I'm easy to reach on Reddit or social media.
My name is Bruce Fenton, I'm a Bitcoin enthusiast, president of an investment firm and father of four.
Have a great day!

Look -- I've worked in economics and owned an investment firm for 20 years-- you asked for a source....rather than be an arrogant guy and say "Dude, I AM a source....I've been quoted in the Wall Street Journal, IBD, Fortune, Forbes, CNN and Bloomberg...my words have as much or more value as they would if I said them in an article and then linked to it."    Instead, I Googled it and posted the first link from a reputable source that seemed relevant.   It's a VERY well known concept in economics....savings helps economic growth.    This isn't something widely disputed....it's very accepted as true.  I meant the post as an educational thing shared by someone who knows what they are talking about in this own particular, narrow area.  For source, you can ask any economist or Google it yourself and see many sources on this.

History is littered with perhaps thousands of examples of bull headed creators who overvalued their work or didn't value commercial success -- 
Comic writer Alan Moore, creator of V for Vendetta, League of Extraordinary Gentleman and the Watchmen hates the movie business so much that he refused millions of dollars in compensation for those films and would not allow his name to be used in the credits.
For future comics he wrote he made even more strict guidelines on copyright ownership ensuring that no one can even buy the film rights.
That's his right as creator.

I'm the only serving officer -- we have a group of founding members which is similar to a board and they are listed on the bitcoinassociation.org website -- we've also announced we will move to a DAO model ---  none of them are involved in this in any way I know of other than Greg Simon who I asked if he would be willing to travel to Japan to speak to the court since he speaks Japanese.  If he did go he would go on behalf of the association not SaveGox or any other group and he hasn't spoken to anyone on the Savegox team as far as I know.
I know you like to think there is a massive conspiracy.   Bizarre that you think I'm promoting the plan -- I'm arguing factual inaccuracies --- take a look at my blog --- before every even mentioning the SaveGox plan I was advocating for customer coins to be returned to customers....I don't really care how and in my mention of this plan I said it was not perfect.
Just think logically -- if I was involved and had some financial incentive don't you think I'd say so?   I have a 20 year old investment firm, I've raised billions of dollars, have a large social media following etc. why wouldn't I just say that I'm involved and they could include me and compensate me?
You disagree with me about interpretation of complex legal matters which are changing by the day so you assume it's a grand conspiracy.  It's not.   I want to see the coins returned to the customers and based on the Let's Talk Bitcoin program covering it and a review and the other research I mentioned I felt this was the best option to make that most likely.
If you are a huge fan of Okcoin, who has not released as much info or you are a huge fan of liquidating the coins for Yen and getting them paid by the courts -- fine, but disagreement is reasonable -- it's not reasonable to make attacks and claims because you disagree with someone.

Okay if they pack up and close and take the Bitcoin then that would be called "theft" 
Now is the part where you say "prove it, theft laws don't apply to crypto" and I send the laws about larceny, grand larceny etc etc. and then you say those aren't relevant.
It's really pretty clear - if someone steals Bitcoin or commits fraud related to Bitcoin they have violated existing laws.    The laws don't need to be specific to crypto.

Well I asked that question because your question was so utterly baffling that I'm trying to wrap my head around what your purpose could possibly be.
Apparently you think there is some sort of problem with someone asking the opinion of others (which is pretty decentralized).
I think you were trying to be clever by saying "we don't need spokespeople it's a new decentralized model".   
I never said I was starting a PR firm or an official list or anything else and have no interest in doing so....I'm simply interested in what other people think are the leading voices.
Apparently you don't like the idea of leading voices or you think no one should speak or whatever....really no clue what your point is other than being a bit trollish by waving the "you don't understand/ the old establishment is dead" flag.

Yes of course,  I spent three days with him this week, lots of time in cars and meetings and briefs.
I don't want to get too much into his thoughts on Bitcoin because they were private conversations but basically he is a very smart guy - I think he's concerned about the money laundering issues, association with drugs.
The foundation itself does things on long term plans -- like five years - so Bitcoin didn't even exist as we know it when they did most of their plans in the area of financial services for the poor and digital money (the area who looks at this kind of thing).
Let me be clear that the purpose of my meetings with him and others in the foundation are not Bitcoin related - there is no secret announcement or anything pending.   Of course I'd like to talk with the whole organization as much as possible about how Bitcoin can reduce poverty whenever I can.
@_date: 2014-02-07 14:23:21
I just disagree with your points so much that I don't think you are seeing my argument as rational response to your points.
No, I don't think regulation helps prevent something like Mt Gox....not in a meaningful way.   I don't think we end up with less money laundering as a result of regulations in any meaningful way.   Certainly nothing close to worth the massive harm done by regulations.
Take just one example: the requirement for firms to keep and retain email.
How much fraud and theft does this stop?   Would a Bernie Maddoff comply with such a thing?   Of course not, he'd have a secret email he never told regulators about.   Yet, this one simple regulation costs hundreds of millions of dollars-- special servers that prevent data from being erased, entire companies which specialize in email compliance etc etc. goodm honest, well meaning people who get in serious trouble and lose careers because they mistakenly violate a rule like this (by, for example, hitting "reply" when a client emails you on a personal, non business address rather than first switching accounts and cutting and pasting the message over)
We don't end up with a "better situation for all" we end up with tons of pain and burden on the honest and regulations which are ignored by the dishonest.   In some ways, regulations actually INCREASE crime.   How?  Because the focus of law enforcement is so much on those who comply that they ignore the worst offenders who are outside of the system ....this is why, for example, the foreign beneficiary letter scam is almost never prosecuted....because the perpetrators don't play by the rules.
This is what I mean by regulations.

I'll make a deal with you:
If you can get Ben Lawsky to add a very, very simple line to the proposal which says "no violence will ever be used in enforcement of these regulations" then I will delete my speech, fully support the regs, publicly apologize to Lawsky and donate to the charity of your choice.
Fact is, he can never do so -- his entire existence and the legitimacy of his proposal comes from violence and only from violence.
Those who don't comply have guns pointed at them, handcuffs placed on them and be placed in a cage when they have harmed no one, have no victim and no one has even complained about them.   That's violence.  Plain and simple.

But that's not the way it is in the US -- banks, parking lots, landlords, brokerage firms, lawyers, safe deposit companies, registered investment advisors (like me) etc. ....All have strict rules about keeping client assets and customer assets separate.
I'm not a lawyer either but I deal with them often and one area I know for sure is US investment firms -- I was a FINRA general securities principal for 18 years and own an independent firm.   When brokers or advisors receive client assets it is absolutely not a transfer of ownership -- client assets are separate from corporate assets.   
The client assets are separate and not included on the balance sheet,  When a firm goes bankrupt the assets don't suddenly jump on to the balance sheet.
It seems that by lumping everything together this case is the one that's breaking 100 years of global business standards.  If Gox had been a Forex trader instead of a Bitcoin exchange then it seems clear that the client assets would be separate and would be returned to customers.

Well -- all laws, at the end of the day, no matter how well meaning are indeed enforced by violence.
Even something as simple as the social media compliance above.  Make no mistake, if a registered rep pulls a Rosa Parks and says "I refuse, it's none of your business what social media I use" they will send a letter...they will bring him to a hearing....they will take his license and, if he still engages in his trade they WILL come and handcuff him and place him in a cage.
The state is the only one who can grab you from your home and legally cage you.. every other function of the state can be done by someone else, schools etc....violence is it's most pure and defining characteristic.
That is the nature of ALL regulation and laws, no matter how well meaning...eventually they are enforced at gunpoint by men with badges and nightsticks.
Otherwise they would not be called "laws" but suggestions and I have no beef with suggestions.

You seem confused about what I wrote ....I said IF Bitcoin was regulated the way Finra was.
As far as what laws they have passed...none....the law gives authority of the regulators to make regulations....these regulations are then legal requirements for everyone.
Are you aware that there was a hearing about Digital currency in New York?  Once a regulator (including NY finance or FINRA) makes a regulation about sometching it is the law to follow that regulation.
Please don't play the role of nitpicker Internet lawyer next and go back to my statement above hemming over whether its a law or a regulation....point is 1) they are onerous 2) theh do a lot lf harm relative to prevention of real crime 3) there are indeed people who want to see Bitcoin have the same types of rules 4)  you break them you can go to jail

I like the sentiment -- but we should not underestimate the profound power governments have to harm Bitcoin.
With a couple pen stokes the US for example could entirely ban it.  This is not an impossible scenario if something as simple as a terrorist incident was linked to Bitcoin.
If the US banned it that would mean that Overstock Tiger and every other merchant stopped accepting, no banks would allow transfers to or from companies like Coinbase, no VCs would invest and all the Wall St and other plans would halt.
The pride would go to $10-20 or lower -- every holder would go underground -- even this Reddit page could be banned, all the wallets and main websites related to it could be seized and conferences and associations declared illegal.
Now sure, people could still sneak around and transfer coins and, yes, technically and practically the government could not push ally stop those transactions....but make no mistake they could set Bitcoin back 1-2 decades, if not kill it entirely.

Yes, all of these are not corporate in-house requirements but actual mandatory laws.
Nearly all can be see in the FINRA manual covering communications with the public....that's just one section of hundreds....there are many other procedures related to operations, trading etc.
ALSO - reps are covered by SEC rules, fed and state law and directives from State Securities regulators (like Mr. Lawsky of NY) --- they can write a letter about anything ---  the example above about Senior citizens is a great example--- and reps MUST follow that or face serious criminal charges 
Regulators often read the news about something with problems surrounding it like "elder fraud",  "viatacle settlements" or something and write new directives.

This is very different than delivery of a physical product or a service someone has already paid for.
I would imagine that the ONLY reason Circle is being deliberate and methodical with the invites is because they want to be absolutely sure of security, operational and scalability issues.
Why else would they delay?  I think it's great that they are careful.
This is a new breed of high quality Bitcoin company -- they so far shown an awesome product (I've used it, I made my invite request in December of last year) and also shown themselves to be serious and in this space to do well.   They seem to be the type of company that if a mistake was made by them which caused people to misunderstand something or be open to risk that they'd make it right -- so it's perfectly reasonable for them to be extra careful on the rollout.
Facebook was available only to edu addresses for ages and before that just a small number of schools.
I say give Circle a break on the criticism -- they are working hard to make a great product which will be great at bringing more adoption into the space.

I was well aware of issues and moved 99% away from Gox ages ago -- as soon as they had fiat withdrawals and long waiting lists for verification.
Over 1.1 million people had accounts at Gox including Erik Voorhees and Charlie Shrem and others.
I had a very, very tiny amount left there and in fact the reason I paid my Foundation membership from there is because I wanted to spend what little I had left in the exchange.   That delay was one of the early BTC delays and drive home even more that they were a problem.
The tiny remaining amount of coin left I tried to move, moved some, tried to move the rest and it was stuck.

Hi Jim, thanks for this AMA.
Some regulators have been open minded while Ben Lawsky, IMHO has proven himself to be opportunistic and an enemy of the technology.
Do you feel at some point that it is reasonable to simply disengage from dealing with him?
If the revised Bitlicense has many of the same overbearing provisions of the existing proposal, would it be worth simply walking away from NY...even advocating that we stop dealing with this particular regulator?
Lastly, how much has the Foundation or other organizations you know of looked into legal methods to counter not just Bitlicense but the very authority of Lawsky to make these regs as an unelected official for technology which didn't even exist until after his office existed.
Clearly there must be some limits on what appointees can regulate regarding new tech.  
Thanks again for your work and for doing this AMA.

How is it less relevant that it's an SRO?   It's still a regulator and people are still obligated to follow it's rules or they go to jail.
People who think that just because a regulator is private or non-govt or SRO that it means the rule are optional are completely mistaken.
Federal law places certain enforcement under the responsibility of FINRA - you can NOT engage in the securities business without being a member or you will go to jail and if you are a member and violate the rules you can also go to jail.

Definitely not a competitor to Bitcoin Foundation -- I'm a lifetime member of Bitcoin Foundation and they cover areas like code security, security of the blockchain etc that this group will never cover.
Main differences will be that we will not work on those backbone issues and will have more leaning toward areas of strengths of members which tend to be banking / regulatory focused.

If people believe Bitcoin, a currency is more important and will be larger than a texting app for example, then it will be more than twice it's current price.

I'm more against regulation than many of my peers, I think it's likely because I'm one of the minority of bitcoin proponents who has actually been regulated as a financial professional and I know what it is like.
The regulatory practices common in the US are extremely burdensome to honest businesses and, in many cases, do very little to stop criminals.
To often, regulation is used as a tool to grow the power and influence of politicians.
I don't accept that it's simply inevitable and that we should beg regulators for more regulation as some sort of preemptive strike to stop them from decimating us or throwing people in jail who have harmed no one.   Instead we should be asking hard questions like what moral right they have to regulate math and bringing the case to the public and those who want new jobs and economic opportunity.
I still have yet to have anyone present a credible reason why Bitcoin needs new laws:  all foreseeable issues of theft, fraud, money laundering and other crimes are already illegal and already covered by other laws.

Sing a song?
Say "Go team"?
How about say "1CrUG948WZgYs49qfaf1PJQi9qEmpMpjzS"
Are we allowed to say that? With that code someone could send Bitcoin.
If we are allowed to speak numbers, codes and keys then there should be absolutely no basis for any type of regulation of Bitcoin.
If not, and freedom is an illusion we should ask what gives the State the moral authority to come and use guns, handcuffs and cages on us for speaking forbidden numbers. We also might ask why they would want to and who these numbers threaten so much that anyone would consider such a thing.
We've become so accustomed to the heavy hand of government that we are now conditioned when a new technology comes along to ask questions of why...rather than "Why not?"

Well it's not just FINRA it is state securities regulators and it's not pie in the sky alarmist to make the comparison....there are people RIGHT ON THIS THREAD who think that FINRA or FINRA like regulation is the best option for Bitcoin.

I agree that someday BTC may completely replace these structures....just as Kindle and the web is slowly replacing old school print....but even if BTC is as big of a revolution as electricity, the motor vehicle, the internal combustion engine or the internet....we are still looking at 20+ years for that cycle to last....and even then many of the existing structures will will simply rolled in to a BTC model.
Right now BTC is so very tiny in terms of real world financial size it's hard to conceive of this kind of change.
As far as what they would need the money for: same thing as Google and Amazon etc....to grow to the next level -- I'm betting the CEO and VCs want nothing more than for Coinbase to become a Google or Facebook sized company....and plan to follow the same path of every company like that before them....and I bet they hope to do it within a shirt time just like FB AMZN and Goog did.   Even if BTC goes gangbusters and is globally transformative and the price goes to $40,000 per coin in five years it's still barely 1% of a real currency size and the entire market cap of all BTC in existence will still be smaller than a single large publicly traded Wall St company.

It happens with every single company who grows to a certain level....they almost alway want to go public, expand, make aquisitions etc.   Very few major success stories reply soley on organic growth.
Amazon, Google, Apple, eBay, Akamai, Dell, Cisco.....basically anyone you can think of went this path of VC, then later rounds, then IPO, then PE.  With each level you get more sophistication, good partners and the right type of capital to move to the next level.

It depends on the situation -- there are lots of complexities in these laws but generally an idea "I want to make a Bitcoin wallet that specializes in Xmas gifts" can't be copyrighted but a work "the code for the wallet" can be.
In this example it depends on what the flibberjibbit is and how new and unique the idea is, how much of it was already in the public domain etc.
If your flibberjibbit is the iPhone and you copy every single aspect of the design, OS etc. then that is different from using the idea of a smartphone to invent your Galaxy S5

Well its already been a self-correcting issue mostly.  The me too coins have died.   Also, logistics dictate that THE Bitcoin blockchain will be the one most viable for new coins -- with side chains --- even new ideas for alt coins can help the whole protocol overall.
I'd like to see Bitcoin maintain the massive market share and be the place that new startups and development is focused-  but when and if a new, good idea for an alt coin comes along that it by default gravitates toward the Bitcoin blockchain.

This matter isn't about enforcement of contracts -- I listed that as a description of what libertarians believe.
This matter falls under the category of protecting property.
Property rights are a cornerstone of libertarian philosophy and protecting private property is a legitimate role of government.

The Bitcoin Association wasn't intended to replace the foundation (at least not by anything I was involved with)-- some people joined and felt it was a replacement for them -- but that wasn't something I stated or encouraged.
I remained a life member of the Foundation all along.

If someone wanted to set aside Bitcoin for 20 years I'd say not to use any technical solution.   We can't be sure any wallet will work --- 20 is eternity in technology.
The most secure way would be a paper wallet.   But 20 years is too long -- that's a ridiculous risk.   Bitcoin could go to 100,000 per coin and then in the year 2027 some crazy thing happens which changes it all.

Do you agree with people being placed in jail in Nigeria for being gay, people being beaten by the Taliban for sending girls to school or women being jailed in Saudi Arabia for driving cars?
If we want to make this US focused do you have issue with Rosa Parks and MLK being jailed?   People who aided runaway slaves or suspected witches?
Or do you just believe that right now, and only right now, in our country only, our politicians have finally accumulated enough wisdom that they are right to the point that we should be supportive of anyone being jailed for breaking the law....even when that is not applied consistently (HSBC vs Shrem)?
Do you agree with the pastor in the Florida being placed in jail for feeding the homeless last month?
If you DONT agree with all these things then I think it's worth examining your thoughts and words,   If you DO agree with all these things then how do you differentiate from an immoral law?

The people pushing for the bailouts would not frame it as such but it really was that simple.
As an investment firm we literally received a TARP bailout form which asked how much sub-prime debt we invested in.  Firms who did not make stupid decisions did not get a bailout (not that they should have) and firms who did make stupid decisions did.

You absolutely can.  Entire multi billion dollar decisions and life and death military decisions are made based on a percentage estimate from a source.   In the US military a kill order can be given on an analysis confidence that a target is a terrorist....they base this on a combination of known facts, like a license plate known to be associated with a terrorist, a location, associates and behavior.   This isn't the exception it's common.   It's also done in consulting and business.

1) What criteria makes something a copy vs. an emulation?
I think this is complex and copyright law has worked to address it-- it's not perfect nor easy to define.   For this conversation aren't we talking about the concept of whether there is ANY protection for works?  For arguments sake, let's use the example of an almost exact duplicate.
2) How long should "intellectual property" last for?
Good question.  It was originally meant for 75 years - Disney had it changed.  I see both sides but lean towards having an expiration.
3) What should happen to "intellectual property" when the creator dies?
His estate or whoever he sold it to should own it for a certain amount of time.  JRR Tolkien is a good example.
4) Assuming copy and emulation are distinct for you, are they both wrong?
I don't think copying is wrong IF the creator agrees.  Emulation might be right or wrong or un creative or immoral but I don't think we need legal protection of this unless it crosses a certain line of copying.    In 1978 or so a couple cheap rip offs of Star Wars had droids and  "laser swords" which emulated the concept of a light saber.   This should be allowed just as Lord of the Rings spawned thousands of derivatives, some excellent.   Someone in 1978 should not have been allowed to make a movie called "Star Wars Episode X" about the adventures of Luke Skywalker.
5) What makes copying wrong?
6) What makes selling a copy wrong?
For both it's a case of IF the creator does not want this done with his work I think that work is his property and he has the right to decide what happens or doesn't happen with his property.

I very much get the impression from this release that he doesn't want to be bothered or pestered by people.   This is tough -- because as trustee he has been grossly negligent in:
 1) letting people know what the heck happened to their coins, providing any explanation, details of investigation etc. 
 2) being clear that he understands that Bitcoin is property and that the customers should have it respected as such --- clearly he may see this as silly nerd money/ WoW gold of no value -- but people who own Bitcoin believe it DOES have value as does Wall St. etc. his responses are beyond baffling and irresponsible ....not surprising since it seems Mark K has been his main guide

The perception that this forum is censored was the rally cry of the opponents from day one -- you have seen it yourself.
This forum didn't allow discussion of things like XT and, for right or wrong, that struck people as censorship and fueled conspiracy theory and the idea that core has something to hide.  This split the community and led to exactly what we have.
Couple likely facts 1) had this forum allowed open discussion of these issues it's likely r/BTC would have never existed as we know it, Classic would not have probable even happened and BU would almost certainly not exist.
Roger even as recently as a year ago listed the moderation issue as one of the very top issues, even being the number one motivator.
2) Most mods will read the above and say some combination of "tough, Roger doesn't get to dictate what discussion we have"
Okay, that's fine...but it's led to right where we are.
I'm not blaming you, I'm saying it wouldn't be this way if not for the actions of the mods...there's a difference.  For blame you can say it's Rogers fault or you can say he handled things poorly...and sure, without Gavin and Roger and a couple others things would be different as well....  but just the same, this would never have happened if we just had open communications to begin with.
What has been learned from this?  I don't think much.  The community remains fragmented and this forum still is seen by the others as biased and censoring

One of the most obvious ways is to work to use the tech we are involved with:  use blockchain records tied with notations from the foundation saying where funds have come from or gone, use multi sig wallets and other tech.  (Some of this is already or is being implemented)
To be more decentralized, the foundation could serve as a hub for various decentralized projects that people or organizations want to create.  So, for example, instead of people asking a centralized fondation "Please make an educational video for China" someone could post a proposal and members and non members could support it like Kickstarter or something along those lines.

For Linux the mission is simple:  to foster the growth of Linux.
I think thats what we should shoot for with TBF ---  "To increase adoption and growth of Bitcoin technology"  (or something similar)
To this end I think the most key focus areas are the core development which was outlined in the recent mission change ---  I do also think that we should work to educate regulators and do what we can to prevent the more ridiculous oversteps by career ambitious politicians like Ben Lawsky.

The first transaction didn't go through still....and no word from support.
Thank goodness this was only .03 BTC for my Bitcoin Foundation membership -- it's still withdrawn from my account --- I'm hoping they either credit back my account or finally send it to Bitcoin Foundation, which means they get a double donation, which is fine with me.
If this would have been a large about of coins I'd be pretty upset.
Once the test and the correct Bitcoin Foundation transactions went through I actually took a bit more from my account and moved it elsewhere -- that also went fast.

But regulation is an illusion that both those things are solved....if only we had more regulation we'd have no more issues like Mt. Gox...and if only we regulate Bitcoin more strictly for money laundering then everything will be fine.....it's not the reality and all we end up with is a lot of pain for honest people who have to follow these things.

Appeal to authority is a logical fallacy used when the person is not actually an authority.   Like if I was giving an opinion on food or cars -- on this subject I actually am an authority -- you may not like that or it may disagree with what you wish was true --- and you may disagree with my conclusions --- but it's a fact nevertheless.
When a document like this is claimed to be truth and we have no way of verifying it we ask experts on the topic.  I'm an expert on this topic -- I deal with this part of the world at a high level and have for many years.   I'll go against whatever other expert says this is accurate.   Maybe they have more knowledge than I do.   I say it's crap.

I'd never use the word "will".  As far as Bitcoin I do the same thing in my purchases I recommend to others: only invest what you can afford to lose.
Bitcoin is speculative and those who invest in it could lose every penny.  I don't think that will happen - I think it will work and will change the world - but I might be wrong - I won't bet my life savings or home that I'm right and no one else should either.

You make some good points about trust.
But greed and hope of wild increases in price is a key driver of many good things like VC investment and Wall St. interest.  
For Bitcoin to be a real piece of the global economy it needs to reach something like 1% of the size of a developed economy like the UK or something like half that of a tiny backwards economy.
If it does either we are looking at a price of $10-50k+ per coin.   If it doesn't then Bitcoin stays an experimental novelty and never becomes more important.
The price goes with adoption and market size....so I've got no problem with those who trade and say "to the moon"

Oh no, you are still at it?  :)
The SEC and states and other authorities cede certain regulatory functions to SROs like FINRA .....AND THEN THEY WORK WITH THEM TO ENFORCE THEM.... I have seen people have their homes and offices raided and handcuffed and yes, caged for violation of FINRA rules...  
Your point of it being separate from Fed govt is taken....it somehow seems to imply it's not as serious or invasive or whatever.
Also, I get that securities are different....FINRA is just one example I could just as well be a pharmaceutical sales rep and say "look, this is what heavy regulation looks like"
If regulators require a Crypto SRO it would end up looking more like the government or FINRA.
Like I said, I've seen people jailed over FINRA violations -- it's no joke. 
Flip side, there are many cases of people being imprisoned for performing functions governed by FINRA while not being registered.
By the way my primary problem was not so much with FINRA but with state securities regulators and THIER OWN rules which govern members of FINRA.   If you are a member (and you MUST be a member if you do the things which fall under it) you are subject to certain rules ....NOT JUST FINRA rules but ALSO state securities rules..... Such as the rules I used as an example on using the word "elder" or "senior" in marketing material or seminars....that started as something our Mass regulator came up with, not FINRA but it applied to all FINRA reps.
If someone on the panel asked Lawsky if he thought state securities regs were too burdensome I don think he would have said yes....I also don't think he would have said that we definitely don't need something similar for Bitcoin

Lots of complex stuff to cover and I don't have much time but basically:
Fraud and theft is and should be illegal, using a rating agency to prop up securities as you described could be fraud
We should be able to punish bad actors for theft, fraud and other crimes -- I'd be in favor of more personal liability -- it's a double standard Wall St is held to and very difficult for people to be punished for crimes -- enforcement is another challenge
I can't speak for others but I was very anti-bailout and the lack of bailouts would not have hurt me since I was not with a recipient firm

I do not agree that we need regulation.
It seems that many of us are so conditioned that we feel we must beg the government for permission to innovate.
We had Charlie on the panel literally saying we "need" regulation.
The main reason for this seems to be echoed above.....we "need" it not because of all the people being harmed without it but because we are afraid that if we do not have regulation the government will stomp our rights even more.
I do not accept that moral premise.
There is a way to discuss regulation with the regulators which is respectful, educational and sensible without coming across as a radical and causing more regulation as a side effect.

I agree with people who say BIP 38 but if the coins are a significant portion of someone's net worth then I'd say there should also be a fail safe of some sort to recover the password.
For example, you could put the BIP 38 wallets in one safe location and the passwords in another with instructions in a third place about how to locate the password.
I just worry about the use of BIP 38 where only one person knows the password :   Death, incapacitation, serious illness, war, emotional trauma, death of a loved one, being involved in a horrible event like a 9-11 or a fire, natural disaster etc..... all of these things could lead someone to forget their BIP 38 codes or have them lost ....exactly when they'd need the coins the most.

I would encourage as much transparency as is technically possible without violating the privacy of members or employees (such as disclosing certain salaries).
The vision I'd like to see is one of a solid, respected foundation in the industry who furthers the core development and adoption, fights unjust regulation attempts and provides a platform and voice.
The chief failures were growing pains and lack of professionalism in some areas of early creation -- this led to issues like having Mark Karpeles as a board member.
Transparency should be improved including accountability for how decisions are made.

It's NOT his responsibility.  Everyone in this space wants something from Andreas -- he's constantly bugged and gets many offers from people wanting him to consult for them.
It's simply not his responsibility to do due diligence of every single thing he is involved in.
His responsibility ends with the statements he makes.  If he says someone has coins, they should have coins, of he says he made himself available for security advice then that's it.
This seems a bit of a witch hunt.   
I've yet to see a SINGLE piece of evidence that Andreas made a false statement, had inside knowledge of a problem, promoted this investment or did anything else which did not have high standards.

I think if a Bitcoin was at $100,000 per coin, $500 mm would NOT move the market much.....if we contrast to Google (which is one fifth that size for example) who has daily volume of over 1.5 billion ....OR contrast it to a small global currency of a third world country it would likely be pretty stable at that level.
Interesting...at $100k a coin people would start viewing Bitcoin as their "real" money and make it a LEADING measure of value....it's the government fiat which would seem volatile.

Another point to consider:  EVERYONE on this has been willing to negotiate and discuss.  There have been miner meetings and Chinese meetings and CEO meetings and dev meetings and scaling and my meeting where Armstrong and Back and Roger and Gavin all discussed things etc etc etc.   
Roger is always willing to discuss things - Adam Back has done countless hours of outreach.
But in all this there remains a perception that is unwilling to discuss, negotiate or even put that on the table.
Again you can blame the other side, say they are childish etc...but they do have a point when they say they are willing to negotiate.
Would the mods of this forum be willing to discuss this?
Would theymos be open minded to allowing more broad discussion if it meant ending this division?
It can be set up easy enough -- if it works, great, if not then you can call Roger's bluff -- why not try?
The other way I'd ask this is:
Bitcoin is a big place with lots of interest and it's going to be hard to get agreement.  If being open to the possibility of changing mod policy would change what is happening with BU! Would you consider it?

I based my opinion a small amount on Rogers side of the story and a decent amount on the email copies and a very large amount on your handling of the aftermath - the post offering the $20k reward looks like it was written by someone without a lot of understanding about the law.   Mentioning things like "signed by a former employee" as if it was relevant shows a lack of understanding about how things work.  It doesn't matter if a former employee signed it, you are still obligated to follow it.  
This post is another example - if Roger didn't sign v8 then it means absolutely nothing at all.

Honestly, having just run a confernce I sympathize.  There are million things going on, you are looking to break even, have hundreds of emails and fires to put out.  When an employee or helper says "hey, we got ABC Co as a premier sponsor" the first reaction is probably "cool" not "oh crap, I better do due diligence and check them out before accepting and separate all the bogus claims from legitimate claims to judge if they are worthy"
I honestly never knew anything about GAW and could have ended up accepting them as a sponsor.

You are saying I'm supporting a scam.  What scam?
I support the conference.   If you think the conference is a scam say so.
If you think GAW is a scam, okay, I don't care.  I don't support GAW in any way, shape or form and never have.   Take a look through my 1000 or so posts...never one word in supoort of GAW and never one mention of them.   I only supoort the conference.

I was not involved with it, didn't make a profit from it, didn't solicit or accept new govt business -- this was about a decade ago.

Well, like I said, I want people to see the gun in the room.
I can say "the state is violent" and this is absolutely true.
Those who believe the state is legitimate and that the violence is justified (which is a lot of people) can reply "Sure it's violent Bruce and here are examples XYZ where that violence is moral and warranted and why"
That's an honest conversation with merit -- it's a debate republicans or dems or anarchists can have.
But to deny the violence exists entirely isn't productive.
If people thought of it in these terms then we'd have a lot less things like the drug war.

I think we should have more transparency about exactly what the lobbying group is doing.  
I think funding of most education efforts is best done by for profit companies -- but it would be great for the foundation to help on this if there are ways to do so which are not very expensive such as speakers networks.
I personally like the tech for Ethereum and others -- some tech such as those using side chains can work on the same core protocol -- some like Ethereum are separate.  I think the Bitcoin foundation should only focus on those which are Bitcoin or Bitcoin tied (same Blockchain) - but we have synergy with all tech and groups and I believe if others are successful it helps all boats rise with a lifting tide.

My justification for saying the government exaggerates is not based only on this.  I believe they exaggerate all the time.
Here are Rogers words on what happened.
Up to this point everything I had learned seemed idealogical and somewhat abstract, but I felt the need to point out these truths to others. To help spread the ideas of liberty at the age of twenty, in the year 2000, I became a Libertarian candidate for California State Assembly. I vowed that if I were elected I would not accept any salary considering the money would necessarily have been taken from others by force in the form of taxation. I also promised to cut as many taxes and repeal as many laws as I could.
As part of the election process I was invited to participate in a debate at San Jose State University against the Republican and Democrat candidates. In the debate, I argued that taxation is theft, the war on drugs is immoral, and that the ATF are “a bunch of jack booted thugs and murderers” in memoriam to the people they slaughtered in Waco, Texas. Unbeknownst to me at the time there were several plain clothed ATF agents in the audience who became very upset with the things I was saying. They began looking into my background in the attempt to find dirt on me. I had already started a successful online business selling various computer components. In addition to computer parts, I, along with dozens of other resellers across the country, including Cabelas, were selling a product called a “Pest Control Report 2000.” It was basically a firecracker used by farmers to scare deer and birds away from their corn fields. While everyone else, including the manufacturer, were simply asked to stop selling them I became the only person in the nation to be prosecuted.
The reasoning for the prosecution became crystal clear after a meeting with the US prosecuting attorney and the under cover ATF agents from the debate. In the meeting, my attorney told the prosecutor that selling store bought firecrackers on Ebay isn’t a big deal and that we can pay a fine and do some community service to be done with everything. When the prosecutor agreed that that sounded reasonable one of the ATF agents pounded his hand on the table and shouted “…but you didn’t hear the things that he said!” This summed up very clearly that they were angry about the things that I had said, not the things that I had done.
After being told by the US attorney that I would be sent to jail for seven or eight years if I took my case to trial I signed a plea agreement. At the sentencing the judge asked me if anyone threatened or coerced me in any way to sign the plea agreement. When I said “yes, absolutely,” the judge’s eyes became very wide and he asked “what do you mean?” I explained that the US attorney told me that he would send me to jail for seven or eight years if I didn’t sign the plea agreement. The judge responded that that was not what he was asking about, so I replied that I must not understand what it means to be threatened or coerced. The judge then proceeded to lecture me extensively on politics. He carried on about why government is so important and how “taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society” and that government is wonderful in general. He summed up his lecture by telling me that “I don’t want you to think that your political views have anything to do with why you are here today” and then sentenced me to serve ten months in federal prison.
After my release from Lompoc Federal Penitentiary I had to deal with three years of lies, insults, threats, and general harassment by the US Federal probation department. I moved to Japan on the very day my probation finished.

Okay.  Essentially every law enforcement and criminal investigative and private investigative organization on earth disagrees with you and has for  centuries.
The FBI, Interpol, Scotland Yard, various police, insurance agencies and private organizations in cases such as museum thefts etc. have and continue to use rewards for information in cases of crime -- they've been effective at getting leads and convictions, particularly in cases where the case is complex and a dead end where various people could provide info.

The Bitcoin Foundation should not cooperate with any country who declares Bitcoin illegal and records should be kept in a way which makes it very difficult for them to be seized.
This is an ideal case and unfortunately could be difficult to do in some cases depending on the country and the order.   There are not many relevant records I can think of the foundation has.   However suppose the US raided the offices of the Foundation with legal demands for certain items ....then this would be something the Foundation would have to fight in court and could not simply ignore or easily refuse.
Personally I would never cooperate with any government who was anti Bitcoin and I would fight such efforts.  If legally ordered to do something against this I would fight it with every legal tool available.

Hmm....these accounts have had transactions.  
I see a total need for it -- I'm accepting payment for an event registration and have accepted the payments from 8 or so people....a couple have not yet paid....I've swept those funds into cold storage so now all 10 are empty.
It sounds like what you are saying is I have two choices:
1) reuse the same address again for new transactions
2) not use mycelium
That seems like a terrible couple choices.  I should be able to generate a new address for every time I want someone to send me money.
There must be a better way.

The speculation of what numbers it would take are meaningless and impossible to make accurately.
In an auction market of a publicly traded item it depends on how many buyers and sellers there are.   If everyone on earth refused to sell a single coin, save for one guy who would only sell half a coin at $40,000.... then that's what the price would be as soon as someone bought it.

No one grows my drugs because I've never used or tried pot or any other illegal drug.
You just don't seem to have thought through the nature of force, government violence and the way these laws work.  The examples of violence you site in the drug war occur BECAUSE of the government prohibition....just as Al Capine and bootleggers were violent during alcohol prohibition.  If drugs were legal then there would be no drug related cartel and gang violence.
I believe that actual crimes should be prosecuted - not things related to crime like computer usage, peaceful firearm ownership, drugs or money laundering.
I can't take the time to give you info on this and am unlikely to change your mind.  If you are interested read Lysander Spooner, read up on the non aggression principal etc. and think of your definition of violent acts.

I'm not speaking for Erik -- but as someone who feels the same way (I think) -- it's a matter of making a point that the conference isn't the enemy.
Personally I know little about Garza and knew WAY less....basically nothing on Friday.   So while I defended Moe and the conference who I DO know I wasn't comfortable calling Garza a scammer based on Reddit alone.   Reddit has not been reliable in this regard.
I would be happy to call him out as a scammer if convinced with solid data.  I even posted a bounty asking for more data....the response was mediocre.   But, based on what I've seen I have serious reservations about Garza and Paycoin.  There is no way in a million years I'd invest and I think at the VERY least he has been a bad communicator and used reckless and misleading, possibly illegal language,  I wouldn't be ready to claim more than this just yet without more data and a fair chance for a response.
Before I would accuse someone of a scam I'd want legal-level or journalist quality proof.  So far Reddit has had little that meets that standard.

Of course we need to shine a light on things.  When did I say otherwise?
I NEVER said we needed Garza to come to Miami....that is another lie.   
The only thing I said regarding Miami is that the conference organizer is not the enemy.

Most of these measures do nothing to prevent fraud.  Adding 10 pages of disclaimers doesn't affect Bernie Maddoff because he uses fake prospectuses.   Monitoring email of a scammer does no good because he will just use some domain the firm doesn't know about.  Etc.

It's a difference of opinion on transparency and information.
There are a lot of people who lost a lot of money with Karpeles who have no answers.   I'd like to get those answers and if a public forum is the only way to do it then I'd rather see him in person rather than drinking mochas behind a guarded building in Tokyo.
Allowing Karpeles to speak and be questioned is not an endorsement.  Same way that controversial leaders, ex cons etc speak all the time at events.

Ver was convicted in a politically motivated pile of nonsense for selling a product readily available at Cabellas and other major stores.  Why? Because the government didn't like his libertarian and free market political statements.
After this, left the country and renounced his citizenship.  But even though he renounced he had to pay massive taxes to a country he no longer is a citizen of...and despite paying those taxes he is not even allowed to enter the country because bureaucrats dislike him and want to punish him like a child for disrespecting thier authority and making up completely false claims that he would overstay his visa as an illegal alien.
So essentially it's a bogus house of cards built on the trifecta of BS foundations:  politicial persecution by using visa and tax laws.
Seems legit.

If not possible then maybe affadavits of people with real names who actually saw the comment...also more info on where it was made.  
Make it simple enough that a nkt techie investigator could subpoena records which would without question verify that this comment was actually made and made by GAW.

I knew Garza would back down...fraud doesn't like light....and if he had been shut down by demand he could have cried censorship.  If he did speak then people could challenge him and demand answers.

If someone goes into the FBI and says "this guy copied Dr. Dre's logo" or "I heard he said this in an article I read on a forum" then it won't lead anywhere.

As far as I know it's very difficult / impossible for sellers to keep other sellingd from offering thier product on Amazon.
If so 
How long before a scammer
1) buys 100 wallets
2) alters them and re-seals them
3) opens an account as an amazon seller called Sat0shiLabs
4) sells them on amazon with either direct or amazon fuffilment 
Be cautious!  
This is not a SatoshiLabs problem but a scammer / Amazon problem....be cautious and aware.

So when all of Reddit was making the most vile of accusations about Brock Pierce should someone have banned him from a conference if he was a speaker?
Those accusations turned out to be false.
I have ABSOLUTELY no idea if GAW is a scam.  I've done zero research on it.  Before accusing someone I'd want to do several hours research at a minimum...maybe the better part of a day or week depending on the complexity and on conflicting reports and hearing both sides.
Suppose Moe coukd do the research in an hour....is that an hour he had to spare a couple weeks ago before this became an issue? Doubtful -- now that it is an issue he is in a tough spot of people saying the should ban a scammer and a guy saying he's not a scammer and deserves the right to face his accusers and respond.
I wouldn't want to be in Moes position now, it's a no win with lots of hassle and little reward.

 NY Bitcoin Center was responsible for bringing both Congressman Stockman and Rand Paul into Bitcoin events and has hosted dozens and dozens of parties and events and also worked with the media.  
They've had dozens of high quality guest speakers and it costs a small fortune to operate given the high rent costs on Wall St.
So the floor needs to be swept - big deal.  Anyone who can run a better center can pony up the $40k / mo in rent and go for it.

You are now being a troll, plain and simple.  You are also lying.
I have NEVER "stood up" for the guy.  I never mentioned him or the company until today and never stood up for him in any way at all.  I've never defended him or said he wasn't a scam.

I posted a Bitcoin bounty for solid info and data about GAW and have been paying it out since posting.

The comment said "he broke the law...there are consequences"
I said not to revere the law as it's quite often moral to disobey the law....at which point order following people who cannot conceive that the state could be wrong attacked this point.
So I then posted the original comment again with several examples of laws that it would have been moral to break or ignore.

I wouldn't have brought age up as there are plenty of older people who are technically saavy.  I had the pleasure to meet Dr. Michael Derturzos at MIT when he was alive and he could run circles around almost anyone on tech issues.
I think Frank is definitely incorrect in saying Bitcoin is "a way to rob people of thier savings" it's obviouslt much more than that.
As for security issues, they are serious, sure.... But firstly we have serious security issues with other technology as well...credit card fraud is a multi billion dollar problem and let's not forget issues with banks and the 'Cyprus Haircut'.
Security is improving with Bitcoin both through better technology and more solid companies like Circle and Coinbase.  It's new technology so at this stage sure, there are security risks but those are improving every day.

You are a troll.  I have never EVER "advocated" for Garza or Karpeles.  I said that people should be able to speak, the conference organizer is not rhe enemy and I and others would like to get answers from Karpeles.
You posted the same post and links earlier.  It's irrelevant to discussing Ver.  In the last time you posted this I said to go read the actual complaint and to read Rogers side of the story.

@_date: 2015-01-04 03:44:14
So if it was my conference would I boot him now?
I don't know.  For certain I would not invite him or accept sponsorship knowing what we know now.
Booting him is more complex -- there could be contractual or legal reasons that it may not be easy to do.  If someone pays to be a sponsor and you cancel them two weeks out you are at the very least on the hook for the sponsorship and all damages....they can sue for airfare, hotel costs etc.
The other possibility is that the conference feels that more light and a Q&amp;A would be more helpful.  I just don't have all those facts.

He wasn't lying -- the video was made months before the Gox collapse.  People speculated whether Gox had FIAT assets.  He coincidentally happened to live almost next door.  
He went over, looked at the bank statements and made a video saying what the statements said.
Not only is there no evidence of lying, the record of what we know after Gox's collapse corroborates this.
No where did he say he was an auditor, no where did he guarantee the Bitcoin was there......and even if he had, there is no such thing as an audit that lasts in perpetuity -- the events leading to the Bitcoin losses were after this video.

Attendees didn't have to agree to any terms - every person has free will to interact with others how hey see fit.  
I asked that privacy be respected and noted the Chatham Rule.  People didn't have to agree to that to attend.  If they spoke about private conversations then it would be exactly the same as with any other business meeting: the other parties they interact with would lose respect for them.  
By the way-- probably 95% of our human interaction is done privately.  People do not have a right to the private conversations of others whether it's two people, 50 people or an email message or phone call. 
Not sure I really understand the Bilderberg comparison.  
Who exactly are you worried about at the Satoshi Roundtable?   Is the fear that Roger Ver and Erik Voorhees are secretly plotting to use Bitcoin to take over the world so that they can leave everyone alone?
Is the fear that while Adam Back and Gavin Andresen pretend to disagree in public, they are secretly united in some purpose to harm Bitcoin?
The premise seems to be that:
1) all of the participants are in on some secret plan   
2) that secret plan overrides math and code and will somehow harm Bitcoin   
3) without anyone in the public noticing   
4) and without any participant breaking ranks to let people know the secret     
If that's the case then Bitcoin is in trouble.  
If it's not the attendees you are worried about or the protocol itself then it seems the fear would be of meetings themselves.   Private meetings are and always have been a key part of human communication.

I thought about this a lot in planning for Satoshi Roundtable.  There are very few people who understand the basics of the tech, the human issues etc who are also neutral.  
I looked into professional mediators and facilitators as well and this is even more challenging because this is simply not stuff you can brush someone up on in a couple weeks. 
There are two problems:  the rift and the technical issue.   Not sure if the various sides will come together on the tech side at all.  For the rift I'd like to see a more productive way forward and some closure - but it's a complex matter. 
Anyone who wants to work on this, I'm happy to help.

Well you can choose to listed to Fox News or whatever crap media says it's real.   Just remember that they are also getting their info from an authority as well -- it's for you to judge his credentials versus mine and see who seems more accurate.
My opinion has nothing to do with Bitcoin -- the blog entry could have just as easily said ISIS claims Bitcoin is bad and I'd still be saying the article was fake based on the style, writing and manner it was presented --- it was total crap.

Example five:  
James reads Bitcoin reddit daily, he is passionate about Bitcoin and knows he can design a better, more secure, more simple wallet.
He works as a software developer for a huge bank and knows the ins and outs of tech and security.  His genius buddy from MIT proposes they create a startup.
He cannot quit his job because his mortgage is too high and he can't afford to risk going without earning money for the six months it would take to develop an app and (maybe) get venture capital.   
He has no savings.  No option.
His MIT buddy starts the company without him and makes $490 million.

  Most of the coins were sold.  What would tracking them show that we don't already know.
I also said I'd open the records.  I don't have any tx info or addresses whatsoever.  Not sure what is unclear about the times where I indicated that I had nothing whatsoever to do with this spending / loss.  I have no more records than you.   I said I'd give whatever permission needed by anyone to dig into this.
Would we find out that instead of losing all the millions, they lost even more than all the millions?

Not to be a downer but there isn't much evidence that airdrops work well for poor areas.
I spoke with some folks at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation on this and that was the conclusion they had made.
(Want to make it clear I'm not speaking for them / this isn't an official opinion -- I've done consulting for them in the past but not around Bitcoin)

There is not any reasonable organization who would simply turn over confidential information to someone not affiliated with the organization, much less someone who seeks it's destruction.  
Cody likely knows this also.  If he wants to pick an auditor and pay the auditor then the auditor can have all the access they want, the bulk of the work would have to be their own digging as the current foundation has very few records.  I wouldn't stand in the way of any auditor, they'd be welcome.

Many expenses were not paid in Bitcoin - today as well
@_date: 2016-01-04 01:51:52
It was, as I said above, both price drop and being spent.
When I said "that money was spent" I'm referring to the list of expenses that I listed - that money was spent.
If you think Matonis lied, I can't address that, take it up with him.
As for tracking the addresses, happy to open any records there are on this.  Most coins were either spent directly or, more often sold to cover expenses which were paid from the fiat bank account.

Core could be probably be done with this entire matter, have near universal support, get support of Chinese miners, and heal the community by adopting a 2mb HF in addition to the increase provided by SegWit. 
1) I've asked many times for solid technical reasoning why this can't be done -- unfortunately the answers have been vague.  I've offered to share and promote anything that shows a clear case why this would be bad.  (Some people have shared a few things like nullc's moon post but nothing that is clear and compelling that says exactly what bad would happen)
2) the best reasons I've heard why they wouldn't do this are "it would set a bad precedent for how we make decisions" ...in other words it seems that they are mad at Roger and Gavin and feel that compromising would be seen as a loss
If I'm wrong here please say exactly why:
1) what bad thing exactly would happen if they compromised
2) why not do so (aside from saving face/ social issues)
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:12:36

So your contention is that five months ago Mark could have legally taken all of those coins which were Gox property and used them for expansion?   How about salaries?  How about one salary, his own?
If it's your opinion that clients who opened accounts at this exchange gifted the coins and cash to the company balance sheet that's okay but I think many lawyers and clients interpret the TOS very differently and clearly this was not the intention they had.  The TOS states that Gox would hold the coins for the benefit of the member -- likely almost all of the million or so clients took this to mean that they owned the coins even if Gox custodied them.
@_date: 2016-01-04 04:41:03

I really wish that these self aggrandizing ego maniacs were jesters who used humor to expose issues.  
I wish they were even funny.  
Fact is they are simply trolls who thrive on destruction rather than offering anything of value.  
They have no interest in Bitcoin -- and sure as hell have no interest in seeing resolution to the rift of the blocksize issue.  
Worse, they have no ethics and are entirely dishonest.   This piece, while making every effort to make me look bad - is full of outright lies.  
Certainly there should be enough things I've actually done that could warrant discussion without the need to lie.  
Junseth considers himself to be one of the most brilliant minds in the industry.  
He was so incensed at not being invited to the first one that he obsessed about it for over a year.   Since this event over a week ago he has talked about it daily on chats etc pinging me repeatedly on Slack and social media -- still furious that his role as alarm salesman/ podcaster with no audience doesn't merit him an invite.   He genuinely believes that his podcast ranks him above someone like Brian Armstrong or a core developer.  
He's so dangerously delusional and filled with anger and hate that he is not revered for his expertise that he dedicates his free time to attempt every means he can to make others look bad...it's the entire purpose of his podcast.

Didn't see any white tennis jackets but I did wear a steampunk Dr Who t-shirt .. so, there's that.  
As for overall thing -- wasn't meant to be an elitist air but e limited and more exclusive list of participants - I don't know a way to do this other than what we've done.

So US code 18-1956 covers money laundering and this is what you are likely referring to when you say that money laundering isn't illegal unless used for a crime. 
In practical application though this law and similar ones are only the tip of the iceberg. There are a mountain of regulations which act like laws to make violation of AML procedures illegal -- even if they can't prove it was used in a crime.   Charlie's case is an example -- if his lawyers could have made the burden of proof on the state that the Bitcoin were definitely used for drugs would he have gone free?  No, it's irrelevant -- him violating the rules was enough -- so it really is illegal for practical purposes.

I'm sorry if you don't understand how these kinds of investments work.  If two people own shares in Apple stock they do not have any financial interest between each other.

ShapeShift is a technological advancement with elegant simplicity that solves a real problem.  Erik did not keep it secret, he did not announce his involvement until after it was running and had some funding - that type of thing is extremely common.

Oh yeah and owning a lot of coins doesn't now provide much special power to the holder.   
It is something to be aware of and watch and it could potentially be concerning but it's lower on the list of what we should worry about.  
The Wink ETF would have been one step removed from govt.
I'd be much more concerned about the concentration of Chinese mining and lack of nodes than worried about big holders. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:06:51
I think both narratives of the past are correct in parallel.
Doesn't matter much anymore...what matters is today and imho the mod policies drive people to BU, I've talked to people (not just my friend Roger or his "paid shills") who cite this as a major reason for supporting BU.

This is the field I come from - Andreas is always great, I didn't get the chance to watch that episode yet -- and based on what you've said there are a few things to consider:
- Bitcoin is already speculative
- speculation is part of healthy markets 
- more holdings, larger market cap, more trading, a deeper order book etc. all contribute to making price more stable
- just as with Bitcoin directly now,outside of an ETF,  some buy it because they care about the tech or ideology, some buy it to make money long term, some to speculate ...Bitcoin doesn't care, the markets don't care, the more participants the better
- Bitcoin is still hard to buy for many people and for many types of accounts
- the ETF would have been available for millions of people very easily with a phone call or couple clicks
- the ETF had potential to bring in massive inflows and interest to Bitcoin and lead to a big price increase
- as more people owned the ETF they'd learn more about Bitcoin and likely become direct holders...just like people who started on AOL where later onboard to the "real" internet
- wider holding also leads to more news coverage which, in turn, would lead more people to learn more about Bitcoin and take control of coins directly 
- the ETF itself would have been regulated, the Bitcoin in the ETF would NOT have been regulated and who cares if the rules change...Bitcoin doesn't care -- those rules affect the ETF not Bitcoin 
- Bitcoin is regulated by the code and controlled by whoever has the private key - right now today US, Chinese, Russian and other government authorities can order people to do something with a private key or move coins...it doesn't matter if that Bitcoin is on your phone, at Coinbase, in a paper wallet or in an ETF...some people can and will comply, others can't or won't 
- the only real power the US govt has due to Bitcoin being in an ETF is the ability to seize it -- they already have this power with BitStamp, Kraken, Coinbase, Xapo and everyone else ---- it is very very unlikely that the Bitcoin of the ETF itself would ever be seized.  We have lots of problems in the US but still have strong personal property laws... if some specific holder of the ETF had his assets seized they'd take the ETF shares not the underlying coins - this doesn't matter anyway, the government steals coins from people all the time 
- putting Bitcoin into an ETF doesn't change the properties of Bitcoin - it's the same Bitcoin 
- having a concentrated amount doesn't provide any special powers to the holder or subject them to any special rules 
- having said all this, I wish the ETF would have been approved ....but it's still just a better buggy whip in an age of Teslas
**TL/DR Honey Badger don't care what silly imaginary constructs / corporate structures / pieces of paperwork are placed over Bitcoin ...the code and math rules the protocol.**

"Open to deception" no, they DESPISE deception which is why when you censor their posts you might as well come in waiving a badge telling them it's a new law...your effect would be the same.
The core devs get to use the line "not our fault" but YOU can't really use that line, you are a mod.
I don't want people to go to BU, I want this to be worked out within the current system and within core.   But I'm telling you -- the mod policy is fueling BU 
@_date: 2017-03-07 13:04:08
What is SegWit a "compromise" to?   SegWit is what core wants, it's the first offer and last offer...for it to be a compromise would imply that they wanted something less than SegWit but gave in by offering SegWit in compromise.

That wasn't what the issue was at the time.  The discussion was very specific.  Gox was having trouble sending fiat out, they claimed they had money but it was due to paperwork issues.  Roger went and verified that they had the money ...they did.   It wasn't about Bitcoin and he wasn't an auditor

I wasn't on the fence recently but definitely criticized many things about core.  
I'm still frustrated by some aspects and think it's healthier to be honest and critical of both sides rather than being dogmatic about one.  
 I will continue to defend Roger, Gavin and BU from attacks that are unfair or illogical.  I'll also continue to point out areas of improvement for core, such as in communicating with the public.
Most of all I'd like to see compromise be reached between both sides.
@_date: 2017-03-29 16:23:10
Easy to explain:  I don't support BU and haven't.  
I've been critical and vocal about problems with my own "side" (supporting core and SegWit) partly because it's right to be objective and partly because both sides have challenges...best way to improve is to acknowledge them and move forward.   We don't want to be like US politics where we automatically support our side and fight the other no matter what.
...but please don't take any such criticisms of core as support for BU, unfortunately BU has major code issues and leads to centralization so I don't support it.    In a perfect world we could have BU supporters see this and consider supporting a compromise with core.

As far as it being contentious it's contentious because the core devs say so....that's it.  If they compromised it would not be.
Now if they have solid technical reason not to then great, let's see them 
@_date: 2017-03-27 20:29:22
I get the accusations.  Thanks for making the effort.   I'm honestly not trying to be a pain here.
But look...you use Aaron's tweets as if they are evidence when all they do is reference back to the scam email by some fake name person trying to shake down Roger.
If the tweet came from *Roger* and not Aaron's screen shot from some scam email then that's a whole different story.  It doesn't, the whole thing seems to fall apart if we don't trust the email...and what evidence do we have that we should trust it?
I'm not saying you are wrong, you obviously feel strongly about this and spent the time on it.  I'm just saying that it doesn't convince me.  Maybe I'm too skeptical / not smart enough / too likely to give benefit of the doubt or whatever.  I'm sorry, I don't mean any negativity toward you or anyone else.   It just doesn't seem convincing.

@_date: 2017-03-07 20:59:40
This is what I am trying to find.
Perfectly happy to admit that I just might not be smart enough to understand.  Perhaps his critics are right and Roger appeals to stupid people.
By repeating the same issues I'm referring to the argument that because it's contentious it's bad...that's circular and to me honestly discredits the entire side.
As far as attack vectors I have a minimal understanding of issues with larger blocks causing latency which makes it easier for the miner who got the last block to get the new one (because he already has a head start in downloading a longer chain) and some of the issues with centralization -- but what I'd really like to see is a case like they talk about in the NASA case study about O rings.   They determined that engineers beforehand said "these are dangerous" no one listened because the engineers never quantified what they mean by "dangerous". 
  
Also, arguments about 4, 8 or 20 mob are not as relevant,  I'm specifically wondering about 2mb and I've been wondering this for years since Gavin first asked "what is the worst case scenario if we change a 1 to a 2".
"We lose __ miners and ___ nodes based on ___ assumption and this causes ____ to happen which breaks the network in the following way." type of thing

We are probably both investors in a dozen things.  That doesn't mean we are business partners.  We have no financial interest between each other at all.   The only time any money has every passed between us is when Roger paid for tickets to an event I host.

I think the foundation itself should address certain major items that may come up.  Individual and board members should address things as they see fit and may not necisarily be representing the foundarion.  JinYoung is unique because she is a public relations person.  Are you saying she should apologize?  I probably would not say so, I'd have to think about it, I likely would have used different wording.
If elected I'd continue to make exactly the same type of statements I make now but would be clear that they are only my views and not thst of the foundation itself.
@_date: 2015-01-01 00:01:12
How about you ask me about something rather than make assumptions?   
I've been pretty clear and transparent.
My investment firm, Atlantic Financial, bought the company Fleetwood Video some years back and changed the name to FDVT or Fleetwood Digital Technology Corp.- I believe 2004 or so but I am not positive -- certainly quite a while back.  A family of a deceased business owner approached me and asked me to buy the business for what seemed to be a cheap rate.  I figured it had enough revenue to cover the purchase cost and some goodwill from being so old (founded in 1985) and the customer list and registration to do business with the government.
The company served the clients mentioned - mainly selling blank video tapes for security cameras.  That's pretty much what the business did.  One of the Atlantic Financial employees had plans to make it into more of a broad consulting company but we didn't.   
The company continued those services for a couple years as the contracts wound down and never worked in those areas again.  We considered pursuing some government business but didn't.  The company never asked for or got any new government contracts and the one part time employee who was on board with the aquisition moved on -- the internal employee working on it moved on.   The small amount of revenue that came in covered most of the costs of the purchase.  
I had thought that the business might have had value since it is a service disabled veteran business and I'm a disabled vet -- but I never used that certification or pursued those lines of business.  It's really not my cup of tea.  I had also considered using the business as a vehicle to help out a freind who is a martial arts trainer who had trained military and police - so he could run contracts through the business since it was registered in all the databases needed to do business with the government but it was too much effort relative to the reward.
We scrapped all the inventory, delisted all contracts with all government agencies and turned the shell of what was left into basically a catch all for web development and domain names we are afflicted with.   The company took on a couple small web consulting clients in later years.
At the time -- 2004 or so, I was not as adamantly against the government as I am now.  I had some interest in some types of government contracts -- I didn't pursue them but some of the work such as USAID efforts in Pakistan and security work interested me.  I didn't pursue it, it doesn't interest me now and I don't do any government work now.   Even the tiny bit of work that this company, which was owned by my company did was not something I was personally active in or profited from.
I am only giving so much information for full disclosure.   That client list is pretty similar for Google, Microsoft, Dell etc Etc.   The government buys a lot of stuff.   I don't like it, I don't prefer working woth government and I wish they were smaller.

I think you are projecting a number of views on me because I'm pointing out that the State is violent.  I'm not advocating many of the types of things you are talking about here.
I'm simply pointing out that the state is violent.  I'm trying to get people to see the gun in the room so to speak and be very careful about uttering "there outta be a law" unless it's worth doing violence to others and to also focus on laws which do not use preemptive aggression.   There are people right in this thread who don't see having assets seized or being placed in prison as violent acts.
I've never said that assault, rape, murder, theft etc is not something legitimately enforced by the state.

Well the thing is, the Bitcoin Core team is not always going to be unified / unanimous.
Someday Peter Todd proposes BIP 200 and many devs agree with your idea but the person controlling Twitter says "Core rejects BIP 200" -- and you say "whoa, wait a minute I have 20 ACKs and 2 NACKS" -- suppose by then the account has 20,000 followers.
You then make a post to the website and it's deleted.
See what I am talking about?
Saying "Core believes X" is sort of like saying "Bitcoin thinks ____" I know most are pretty much unified today at this minute - but it is completely inevitable that there will be splits and disagreements in the future.   This is fine and healthy but when one or two people control communication channels then it can be problematic....as we see now.

I wish you and the other mods could have been in Mexico and seen what happened.   
About 10 people went in as supporters of core: Johnny, Julia, Trace, Tone etc.
And 10 went in supporting BU:  Roger, Jake Smith etc.
About 300 were undecided.
At the end I bet 90% of the undecided ones moved to Rogers side or leaning toward Roger...one of the very significant reasons was because they could see what was happening with the discussion and comments being deleted.
These were not "paid shills" or people loyal to Roger, they were generally unbiased, Bitcoin fans who just want to use the tech.  When they saw the debate with Tone many felt Roger won....but when they saw comments (some of them their own) being deleted they immediately bought in to the idea that core is a corporate run effort who doesn't want the truth discussed.
Whoever on the mod team who deleted those comments single handledly probably brought two dozen people to BU and absolutely zero to core.

I have no idea what this post above is about.  No one paid me to invite anyone.  I've been offered money many times for invites and didn't accept.  
 I met the Dash people in Miami at TNABC and invited them- I remember the exact moment.   They showed me the demo of the Dash soda machine.  It was three booths over to the right of the main registration area.   I asked who was responsible for changing the name from Darkcoin to Dash and said that was a smart marketing move.  I asked if Evan Duffield was related to Megan Duffield (who works with the Bitcoin Foundation) and got thier info and invited them.

Um okay, but no substance.   The original post I made asked for the same thing Gavin asked and the same thing I've been asking for TWO YEARS:   What exactly bad would happen if there was a 2mb HF in addition to SW?

That's not accurate.
Roger happened to coincidentally live next door to Mt Gox, he went and reviewed the bank account balances and made a video saying they had fiat according to those statements.
1) what he said was true Gox DID have significant fiat
2) the hack was Bitcoin not cash, Roger never said they had the Bitcoin 
3) Roger never claimed to be an auditor 
4) only a fool would take an internet video of perfect proof or assurance that a company would never have problems
5) the Bitcoin hack was months later - by then even the cash / fiat issues could have changed significantly
6) Roger apologized for making the video  
If you disagree with him on technical matters that's okay but the Gox thing is tired

No first hand knowledge at all but I heard he got tired of online attacks and, at least temporarily, bowed out of some things.
If correct, this isn't shocking.  
The online attacks in Bitcoin circles are very sad and toxic.  
I'd really urge everyone to remember that real humans are behind these things.  
If you are arguing with someone think of the person separately from the argument.
Don't think of Greg Maxwell as a sharp tounged guy who took your argument apart - think of him as a cool guy with tons of common interests who is an active contributor to Wikipedia and who collects fascinating photos online.
Think of Gavin not as some villain of blocksize debates but as a father of a beautiful family in a small New England college town, a guy who came in to this very early and has done a whole lot of work for less pay than he could have gotten from 100 other options.
Think of Brian Armstrong not as a guy trying to screw the world with overbearing compliance procedures, he's a guy trying to build a damn good company and not get it smashed apart by regulators in the process...and so far he's doing a damn good job.
This list could go on for 100 more names.  Most of us are thick skinned but the toll of fending off attacks can be exhausting. 
Human beings are behind these posts.  Attacks waste energy.  Accusations that are not proven are especially harmful.  This industry, like any new pioneering space, has a higher than average percentage of crooks, fools, opportunists and scammers.  But to accuse an innocent person of a crime, scam or dishonesty is itself a very bad act.  Try to have solid, backed up, verified proof before making accusations.  Pretend we are journalists or lawyers. 
We already have the ups and downs and stresses of a wild and new technology industry.   It would be great if people worked to have less attacks and more camaraderie online.
Yesterday I tweeted that "Bitcoin people in person are the greatest people in the world.  Bitcoin people online are the worst people in the world."
We all share a lot in common.  If two fiercely arguing Bitcoiners online didn't know each other and met in line at a grocery store, perhaps one noticing a Bitcoin T-shirt of another they'd say "You are into Bitcoin? Cool! Me too!"

It's a straw man.  Is anyone really saying that Bitcoin won't survive because of Mike leaving?
I don't care if people disagree with him or agree with him on the technical issues: 
Bitcoin has some serious problem right now, it has a scalability problem but more importantly it has a communication problem, a community that has become toxic and issues with governance for development of something which by its nature is not governable.
 
This all leads to a weaker community which drives people away, reduces investment and harms the public image.
Serious people have serious concerns.

You re trying to sell your Bitcoin which are on your Mycellium wallet on Coinbase...
You go to Coinbase...
....Bitcoin 
....you'll see a thing that says "Get Bitcoin address" 
...click that and an address and Q code will come up
.... cut paste or use the phone to scan the code in mycellium
...send the coins to Coinbase
In some minutes or an hour on the high end they will show up in your Coinbase account
Then you can easily hit "sell" and they will go to your bank.
Better option is to hold if this is mkney you can afford to risk

Again this post focuses on old stuff.  
No, I don't have financial records from before I came aboard, I got nothing other than a handful of passwords.  No marketing or collateral materials, no files or old records etc.  I don't know where the old minutes are and if we find them I'm not sure of the ramifications of releasing conversations that the participants thought were private when they made them.   
When I came aboard I didn't even have a password for the website or know what server it was on.   I don't have any accounting records.
To get the website working I had to simply cancel the server company, change the registrar (with some help was able to get listed as a domain admin) and simply start a brand new website. 
I get that Karpeles is a bad guy, I get that many blame Vessenes and that he had all kinds of bad deals.
What can be done to move on from that now?   Should I more publicly condemned them?  Ban them for life from ever rejoining?  I'm not being sarcastic but I don't know what I can about people I never met.
Accounting for thier past misdeeds: they broke things, they were not transparent, wasted money and made mistakes.  They also were hit with a 60-70% drop in Bitcoins causing millions in losses.  They also had the bad press of Karpeles and unfortunately Shrem (who I in no way place in a category of Karpeles).
I don't know what else to say, I'm not a forensic investigator (although one new board member is and hopefully he can find some more details) - I'm not going to apologize for or justify for bad actions of people I had nothing to do with and never even met.
I have a family and job vying for my time  -- I volunteered with no pay to spend time on this for an organization I have less to do with than you did (sounds like you were an earlier member than me) because I wanted to do some positive things for Bitcoin and I think that the organization existing is better than failing.
As I said to someone the other day:  When I moved into my house the basement had been used by the owners college aged kids to party and had a carpet with moldy beer stains.   I didn't hire CSI to find out who spilled the beer, how much, when and how.  I don't care.  The carpet sucked.   I ripped that shit out, chucked it in the trash and never gave it another thought.   Then I built an awesome home theater.   I'm hoping to build a theater here, not climb around in a dumpster with moldy beer rugs and I'd urge people to join me on that.

I can't commit to any spending until the budget is under control and we have enough capital to exist.  I mentioned crowdfunding because there are many requests for that in this and other threads.  I can also accept earmarks if anyone wants to donate and specifies that thier donation go to advertising.  Once the budget and current financial mess is repaired then we could look at overal future budgeting for advertising.   On a side note I think that we should be cautious of things like TV ad campaigns.  Unless someone has many millions of dollars to ingrain something into people's buying habits then I think ad dollars are better spend on things like targeted social media, serving of educational videos (the What is Bitcoin video is a great example, $8000 in costs and millions of views).

I don't know since I haven't listened yet but I don't think that's the case.  
Andreas is awesome, my favorite Bitcoin speaker, and I agree with him 99.9% of the time but this specific area isn't an area he has focused on a lot afaik.
So suppose the SEC changed the ETF rules .... what is the worst they could do?
- steal all the coins - yes, possible, but very unlikely, they could do the same with Coinbase or BitStamp
- the ETF could become fractional reserve like gold funds - Okay, then ETF holders could sell their shares 
- the SEC could decide Bitcoin isn't permitted anymore -- (also unlikely) then the fund winds down 
The thing with Bitcoin is that it's self governed.
When I move Bitcoin from an address controlled by Bruce Fenton to Atlantic Financial holding Company of Ras al Khaimah (which I own) what really says that address is what?   It's imaginary / in my head.   I can say "this address is ABC Corp. and that address is XYZ" but those manuervers are unrecognized by the Bitcoin protocols and Bitcoin doesn't care...all Bitcoin cares is who actually controls the private keys.   It's really just meaningless paperwork ....I can use my phone right now and transfer 1 btc from this address to that address also on my phone and back -- I can say that one address was mine, one my company, one was a trust or your address... but only the actual control matters.
So with the ETF it's the same....just a mountain of paperwork and legal jargon and structures and authorities all, built on top of Bitcoin.    
Ultimately under all those piles of paper work is a little (or huge) pile of Bitcoins sitting here with someone...presumably a complex multi sig system...ultimately controlling those keys.   
That little pile of Bitcoin is sitting here saying "I don't even know the pile of paperwork exists, I never heard of the SEC and don't care about the PBOC, my code tells me to release these coins to who controls the private key and no one else."  And that's what it comes down to... no matter the structure, no matter how complex, there isn't anything the SEC or anyone else can to other than order some humans to use those private keys to move the coins.  On this honey badger doesn't care... Ross Ulbricht and others have had coins taken and it doesn't affect Bitcoin at all really...it just marches on.   But those cases are very rare.
I suppose the biggest risk Andreas might be getting at is largr scale manipulation by people who don't care about Bitcoin.  This is a risk as there are forex traders who will seek to "break the bank" and manipulate markets to their advantage.  But I'm not that worried about this....that usually happens with weak currencies.

I agree on miner communication being also bad ... but in all honesty I have to say that core dev comms have been bad also.   I don't fault them for this.  Everyone has different skills - there are those good at communicating who can't code "hello world". 
 
I really appreciate all they do and also appreciate that they get a lot of crap and also appreciate that being public spokespeople/ debaters isn't likely to fit the personality of someone who likes to code. 
But just the same, the problems are real.  
Look at where we are now:  we had a lot of people asking for a 2mb increase.  Core actually delivered this in the form of SegWit... however most people didn't even realize this included a capacity increase until 6 months ago...some still don't, they are focused on block size.   With better comms core might have clearly said "here you go" and SW would have been seen by more and earlier as a solution. 
Another example:  many asked for a 2mb HF - and for much of the discussion there was not a clear and consise explanation of why this would be dangerous. 
Core devs have their own preferred comm channels: IRC, the mailing list, GitHub etc. many other major stakeholders use other channels: conferences, calls, meetings etc. 
TLDR:   Core devs get a lot of crap, I sympathize and appreciate all they do ... but it's okay to recognize a weakness just like those of us who can't code can recognize that weakness we have.  Comms can be improved and lots of people would be happy to help Core do this.

Also, unfortunately, core has had a hard time crafting a message that's compelling and easy to understand... so the combination of forum moderation, lack of a compelling argument from core (from the perspective of BU supporters) and the PR efforts by Roger have caused a steady increase in support for BU.
This is really unfortunate as compromise and discussion would have been a lot better than what we see now.   Even more unfortunate is that no lesson has been learned from this.

Like Erik, I'm undecided and also smart enough to known that I'm not smart on these things.  
I want to leave the heavy lifting to people with much more technical competency.   But I do wish to be informed about developments.
Having said that, a couple observations:
- it seems at best a cheap shot and at worst a bit manipulative to call Bitcoin Classic an "alt coin"  - clearly this is directly related to Bitcoin and arose from the blocksize debate - it reminds me of something a cheesy salesperson would say: "We sell real aluminum siding, our competitors sell toy plastic siding" then they proceed to correct you every time you mention it and call it "toy siding"
- XT and Classic are a lot different than the 100 other also rans and the intent is MUCH different - this is potentially going to be the new Bitcoin - so it's a lot different than pot coin or hobbit coin or whatever
- okay, let's put that argument aside and say that this IS an alt coin - so what?  This is a sub that is designed for people to keep up with Bitcoin news and what is important in the industry -- this is newsworthy -- if Gavin got a job at Hasbro and decided he was going to design Star Wars toys, guess what, that's newsworthy also and people should have the right to see the news and vote up or down - just as some news about Ethereum was relevant - did this sub need to know every detail? Nah, but it's self moderating in many ways -- but at the very least a discussion of related tech, a large crowdsale in Bitcoin etc.
- the votes of the members of a sub are the best measurement of relevance - 171,000 people are on here and more of them upvotes that article than any other one in the time it was up ....so not only did members of this sub think it was relevant -- they thought it was THE MOST RELEVANT - so the main question is:  Is the goal of the mods to serve what the subscribers want from this sub or to put forth an opinion?
- some devs and people passionate about this issue don't care about what the public and CEOs think (a though they still need the miners) - for those who do care I'd say that they do a massive disservice to thier cause by censoring and blocking discussions, calling it an Alt Coin or making statements that seek to discredit some devs
Fact is, there are some damn smart people on both sides of this, there are some huge and important companies on both sides - it's not a decided issue - 
I'd really love to see more and discuss it here - those who dislike Gavin's plans should not fear discussing them and poking holes -- but, like Erik said, the more someone shouts to pay no attention to the man behind the curtain, the more it makes a lot of people think that there is a problem with core that people fear to discuss

I answered this on my Facebook:
(TLDR: 5% /100,000 coins or so)
In case anyone is curious, for lottery winnings is always the cash option.
While it’s unlikely that you will ever win the lottery, the principals of calculating the present value of future payments / earnings is a key one for legal settlements and other negotiations as well as valuing a business or other assets. 
The price alone means nothing and the terms mean nothing -- only the price and terms together mean something. If you own a home worth $200,000 for example, I will give you a signed contract today that says I'd buy it from you for $5 million cash. Great deal? No. My terms for this example are that the $5 million be paid to you from me $1 a day for 5 million days. See? What seemed like a great deal based on price is actually a terrible deal depending on the terms.
Lottery winnings and most legal settlements are based on an annuity from a guaranteed stream of money. The big fat number never exists. Just a smaller sum that they know will add up to this over time. The only way the lottery or insurance companies can guarantee this stream of money is to place the funds into something like CDs or T-Bills. So, as long as you can beat T-Bills (among the worst returning investments) then the cash option makes sense. With a cash option you can also have a lot more flexibility with tax payments -you'd pay a huge early sum of taxes but later on much of the growth could be tax deferred and only paid when gains are realized - these could also be offset by losses- so. over time your tax liability would be much less.
With the $600 million or so cash value of this lottery winning (after taxes) you could have access to the types of private equity, hedge fund and venture funds used by the very wealthy - in many cases these investments see consistent returns in the high teens range and have for years. I still wouldn’t bank on getting an 18% return though -- too many variables and issues. We could face a global downturn and there are many other issues. 
You also would not want to bank everything on a few money managers or funds no matter how good they were because the high returning funds are more susceptible to big down years. 
There is something called a Monte Carlo analysis which shows that even a return of 18% average might not perform as well as an average of 12% over the same five year (or whatever) time period. How? Because if the first one returns, for example, -30%, -15%, +10%, +35% and then +90% it is an average of 18% while another with an average from 12%, 12%, 12%, 12%, 12% equals 12% of course but would have more money than the first one. This is because those early down years knocked the first option down so it had to play harder to catch up. If each of the above started with $100,000 the first one would be earning interest on only $59,500 by the end of year two, while the second one is earning its 12% on $125,440. At the end of five years, option two has $176,234 versus option one having $167,879 - despite an average annual return that is 50% better!
So, I'd say to plan on a return of something like 8-9% and tell the money managers to target that (not each fund but someone like me or a family office who is doing the overall asset allocation). It would be nice to be pleasantly surprised. Personally I'd put the majority of the $600 million - probably $300 Million+ into a portfolio of venture capital and private equity funds and a simple global equity portfolio made up of large multinationals. I'd have another $70 million for hedge funds and opportunistic investments. I'd have a good of $100 mil or so chunk in global real estate - income properties and agriculture diversified by type and country - I'd buy most of it myself rather than through a REIT or fund. I'd have small amount - maybe 5-10% in bills, notes in global currencies. 
I'd put 5% in Bitcoin and 5% in Bitcoin related investments - but I would not recommend that for a client who was not familiar with that industry. Perhaps I'd recommend 1% or so for someone else - it really depends on their risk tolerance and other factors. I'd also have a small amount in commodities - maybe 5% or a bit more. I'd have physical gold and silver in a vault as well as some exposure through agriculture etc. This portfolio would only work for someone who can whether the ups and downs of global capital markets. If you are the type to panic and sell everything if you lose $50 or even more on paper, then you wouldn’t want this portfolio.
Some math:
(Tax advantage of cash option not included)
Annuity payment option on $1.4 billion = $70,000,000 / year FOR 20 YEARS
Cash option = lump sum of $868 million = if you invested this and were able to get 8.1% annually -- you would receive $70,308,000 FOREVER – the ideal thing of course would be to live on less and let it grow more.
You'd also have significant tax savings from the cash option over time (but you would have a large initial tax bill).
This is a rare opportunity that the lottery could make someone not just silly rich or temporary rich or rich enough to go broke as the lotto often does but it could make someone actually rich.

I worked with Olivier at Bitcoin Foundation.  I also coincidentally happen to be a passionate advocate against anti-Muslim bigotry and misconceptions.
He said a bad thing....he appologized...again and again.
He also has said that this is not his opinion today.  There is nothing more he can do now.  He's a human being.  Everyone makes mistakes.
IMHO his apology should be accepted.
This also isn't as relevant to Bitcoin as something technical or related to a Bitcoin company.

"China" or Chinese miners is not one monolithic thing.  Just because it is one big and important country does not mean that all or even a majority of miners or CEOs act as a de facto caucus.

I'm not neutral -  I support core, support the road map, support SW and LN and don't support BU because I think the code quality is concerning as well as the centralization of miners is concerning.

I'd support a compromise that would make both sides able to move forward if possible.

There is a difference about what the MRI machine should do.  For this analogy it would be like saying that a majority of engineers want the MRI to have stringer magnetic imaging and a smaller number of engineers and many members of the public want the MRI to focus on patient comfort.  The first group might say an MRI is useless without good imaging, the other group might say that if no one is comfortable using the MRI the imaging won't be used.
Maybe then both sides agree that both issues are important but disagree with the technical method of how to do so.

In what's supposed to be a scientific argument, yes that does sound vague.

Not a very fair / accurate headline.   
I know Circle pretty well, from what I see they 1) want to make an awesome and easy to use product that serves customers and 2) they want to do so in a compliant and completely legal way.
The US and global regulatory system we operate in is very complex and fraught with risk for all companies, not least of all fintech startups.  
People should be careful not to confuse the eagerness of companies to have compliant and smooth running businesses with a desire for more regulation.   Circle, by the way, has been very productive in standing against several onerous regulations in the past as well: they criticized early iterations of Bitlicence and have worked with other regulators as well in a positive way.

What were your suggestions?
I recognize your user name but dont know exactly which suggestions were yours.  Most common suggestion was to increase transparency.  I did that.
As for MMM -- again, I had nothing to do with them and they were not a member when I came aboard.  Foundation has lots of members - an org went on the website, signed up and p[aid a membership fee.  Within a short time it became obvious they were a scam, the leadership at the time was notified and they were removed as members.
This could happen to any membership organization and does indeed happen all the time.
On Karpeles - I'm not against the truth - I just dont think its relevant.  He sucked, its horrible and an embarrassment.  That's why turnarounds exist.  Your theory seems to be "they had a couple bad guys, kill the whole org" - that doesn't make sense with CEOs, sports team coaches, schoolteachers or anything else.  Think logically - organizations are nothing more than a piece of paper that says how they are organized and who is involved.  Organizational documents cant be good or bad  - only people.  If the people involved change then isn't that what matters?
The Satoshi Roundtable has absolutely nothing to do with the foundation - I held it before I ever had anything to do with the foundation and I'll hold it again.   (and BTW what on earth would be wrong with that anyway- do you think that getting Gavin, Back, Corallo, Todd, Armstrong, Smith etc in the same room at that time was somehow a BAD thing?)
In your entire couple pages of posts on this you haven't listed one tangible actual thing that you disagree with that was done by the current leadership other than me holding an unrelated event and Pierce being sued by an Everquest player.
What do you think we are all doing with the many hours and money we give to the foundation?   Do you speculate we are trying to harm Bitcoin?   Do you think we do it because of the great name of the foundation and how fancy it looks on a resume?  Is Perklin a bad guy for spending 100+ hours on a non-profit conference that will be held Monday?

Those picks are 1 in 10,000 opportunities.
If someone makes a financial plan and calculates future savings based on the assumption that "I'll do better than all but 1 in 10,000 investors and will pick something better than everything else" thats a big risk.   If they base the assumption on Bitcoin then its an even bigger risk as Bitcoin is speculative and an experiment that could go to zero.   It can be a fun mental exersize to think of $10k or 20k+ per coin or a market cap the size of Apple -- but its not a good way to plan which I think is the purpose of the tool.

Not bad-
Couple suggestions:
- disconnecting from the Internet does not guarantee that the private keys can't be read (especially if they go back on the Internet later) - it just makes it safer - better method is using a PC that will never go on the web again and has wifi and Ethernet and Bluetooth hardware physically uninstalled 
 - they can also save bitaddress website to a USB to move it to a clean, offline PC 
- definitely tell them to make more than one copy of the wallet!   This is a beauty of paper wallets...you can have a few, one in a safe deposit box, one in a safe, one with your law firm, or whatever -- when BIP 38 protected all you have to be is trusting enough that the bank or whoever has it won't do a brute force attack
- the final section can use some polishing -- maybe keep the first sections and keep it simpler
Good work

Sure there is a reason "they would not repeat the same errors as before" ....it's an entirely separate set of people from the ones who made past decisions.
Early on the Bitcoin Foundation had growing pains and had some criticism, some of which wasn't fair, some of which was.  
Having Karpeles as a board member for example was a terrible thing.  No one involved now had anything to do with that decision not anything to do with Karpeles... at the time he was chosen to be a board member he ran the largest company in the industry so we can see why he was chosen.
It's all ancient history now - the decisions most people are mad about are from three leadership cycles ago.   Fairest is to judge the Bitcoin Foundation on what it does now and has done recently and what the current people involved have done.

The notion that centralized organizations simply cannot serve any useful purpose ever because Bitcoin itself is a strange one if you really think about it.
Of course Bitcoin doesn't need any Foundation or central organization of any kind - it also doesn't "need" VCs or Reddit subs or blogs etc etc -- but these things all help the ecosystem and help Bitcoin overall.   The Bitcoin Foundation has helped Bitcoin and can continue to in the future.

People forget the contributions Gavin made -- he helped build Bitcoin to the next level in the early key important days.   He look a ton of risk, he was generous with his time and money and he meant well for the tech.
Unfortunately he was not good at playing politics and relations with some key people and what should have been a purely technical debate had baggage around it.
IMHO Bitcoin owes him a debt of gratitude and this space wouldn't be what it is without his contributions.

To make a short term price move it could be as little as a coupes hundred thousand dollars depending on several factors such as which exchange, order book,mtimes of day, trading volume etc....mostly order book.
To make it permanently move that much you'd a lot more.
A $100 increase would add $1.56 billion to the overal market cap.  But you would not need to put that much in of course because as someone out in millions the price would nearly certainly increase greatly because of other buyers. 
If someone is trying to love the market they can also do so easily with a series of smaller, increasing orders that move the order book at a few exchanges.
TLDR:  Bitcoin is a very small market and the price can be pretty easily manipulated.

Two different technologies, two different goal, two different missions.

The founding members have nothing to do with the org.
Not trying to shut people up, just pointing out its not relevant to the organization today.
Literally only one person on the list has anything to do with the org and your only dirt on him is that he was once sued by some guy who describes himself in the suit as a "very skilled Everquest player".
So they had Karpeles as a member....horrible, embarrassing, ridiculous...Karpeles sucks.  But we didn't have anything to do with it and never met him - and at the time he was selected he was by far one of the most important figures in Bitcoin and it was ages before the problems which no one could foresee at the time.... and in any event the people who selected him and worked with him haven't been involved with the foundation for ages.
Do you think that Karpeles left some magic dust on the organizational documents that magically turn anyone who volunteers into a corrupt person?  He's long gone.  Everyone who worked with him is gone.  Everyone who selected him is gone.  If you say you are a journalist how can you explain the relevance of this to the organization today?
It seems like you are simply trying to be negative to people who haven't done anything wrong and are not even accused of anything wrong on your list.
Why not judge the org on who is actually there and what is being done now?
We've got a board member working now as we speak and who will be working tirelessly this weekend on the next DevCore, we have another board member who will support it, we have me flying up to Toronto to help MC.  We do this all without compensation of any kind and because we think it a benefit to Bitcoin.  
The current foundation is absolutely ethical and without the issues you talk about.  You don't serve any positive effect by this.

It's like email for money.  I could email you a note today that says "here's $1000" but that email isn't useful unless some party like a bank says I really have the $1000 and am really giving it to you.
What Bitcoin does it takes that info, a ledger entry really, saying 'I have $1000 and give it to you' and it puts it out in the open for everyone to verify it.  To make it secure and private it uses cryptography but basically it's a giant public ledger with computers on internet having the ability to say what is true: this person really had $1000 and gave it to this person.

A while back, Gavin gave me permission to relay a private conversation we had some weeks before he went to London to meet Wright.
Basically we knew the media was exploring the story that Wright was Satoshi and we were discussing methods of verifying.
FWIW Gavin was skeptical and seemed to have thought a lot on how to review this.
So, people should go easy on the guy as he wasn't some easily fooled person...the hoax, assuming it was a hoax, was extremely sophisticated and would have required massive technical and social preparation.
If Gavin was correct then a lot of people would owe him an apology.   If Gavin was fooled then he deserves no more criticisim than anyone else who is victim of a scam or hoax or con...and this one particularly complex at that.

The "evidence" consists entirely of testimony by Federal agents who were proven to have been involved in theft and extortion of Ross.
Ross was never charged with murder or anything close to it, there was no case and he would not have been convicted.

Example:  You bought $1000 worth of Bitcoin that is now worth $40,000 -  you can donate the $40k and receive a deduction for this full amount.  IRS doesn't care about your basis.
If you SOLD it on the other hand to spend then you'd have to pay a capital gains tax on the gains.
Lowering your cost basis is a good idea whenever possible.
EDIT:  YES OF COURSE THIS IS MORE COMPLEX THAN SIMPLY WRITING THINGS OFF.    This is really most useful to people with decent assets and a qualified accountant.

Seriously?   You think that failing to file a form when selling a few grand worth of Bitcoin to a guy deserves MORE than two years in jail causing unimaginable stress and interruption of one's life and business?
What do you think is a fair punishment for failing to file a suspicious activities form?  Five years?  Life?
Can you point to some or any other cases where such a penalty was handed out for the same act?
[for perspective sake, Charlie was convicted for not filing the form for a few thousand dollars on a guy who was known to, in turn, sell coins to Silk Road users who then likely bought drugs .... 
.... Meanwhile employees of HSBC, by comparison, also didn't file a form... in their case the deposits totaled $700 million and in one branch of the bank they had a special window installed because the Mexican drug cartel was depositing so much cash it physically couldn't fit in a normal bank window.  None of those people went to jail]

Both sides have a point:
1) Companies who want development to proceed a certain way should invest in that development - it's not as productive to critique dev efforts if not trying to help.  It's puzzling that more well funded companies don't hire any devs 
2) Devs should listen to corporate CEOs and their concerns IF THEY CARE TO - it's not my place or anyone else's to tell devs who to listen to...it's their time and their prerogative -- but if they do care...and it seems several do, then they should engage more with CEOs.    In other words, dev can either ignore CEOs or complain when they go off reservation but if they didn't engage then they have less standing to complain about

Not really man, It's not revisionism to say that I never, ever said Paycoin  accusations were unfounded and I have never, ever said a single good thing about them.  That's the simple truth.   (I also never worked with them in any way, never invested, never benefited in any way from them and as far as I know never even spoke to anyone affiliated with them in any way)
I still don't think Moe is a villain in this.  He made a mistake with this and he was put in a very difficult position due to bad luck.   I would bet that he simply didn't know about the Paycoin controversy beforehand and didn't due the due diligence on them ahead of time.  When he booked Garza as a sponsor it was a different environment.   In fact, most people never even heard of Garza until the post about the conference made it to the front page of this sub.  I personally had never heard of Garza until then.  I hosted a conference a month earlier and had Garza called to sponsor it I could have very easily been fooled into accepting that as Moe had and many other conference organizers had. 
People were calling Moe a scammer etc. (They even accused Erik Voorhees and I of being paid off by Moe....absolutely ridiculous). and I think that was uncalled for.  Running a conference is hard work and organizers just don't typically have time to background check each sponsor.  We make a best effort to do so.  I'm sure Moe wishes he would have done more and I think many people will try harder to verify sponsors beforehand.  
Once the controversy started, Moe tried to look at it from a couple angles -- if he canceled the sponsorship he could have been sued for breech of contract -- he worked to solve it the best way he could.  This is way old news.  I was just setting the record straight that I never, ever endorsed or supported Garza or Paycoin in any way.   I gave out dozens of small bounties for people who built evidence on the scam.  I don't know how I could be more clear.  I didn't speak AGAINST Garza immediately because I had absolutely never heard of him....but I sure as hell never spoke in FAVOR of him either.   I immediately researched it and after a day or two concluded he was a scam and said so.
Garza didn't dupe me by saying he'd speak....I have and always have believed that anyone should have the right to speak whether accused, convicted or whatever.  Light exposes cockroaches.
I still don't see how this minor part of a 22 minute interview with Kirby is some massive smoking gun.  I don't think its accurate, based on this, to say he "doesn't know what he's doing".  At best the claim could be that he didn't know how to answer this particular question at the end and you are still unsatisfied with his follow up reply.  
If, beyond that, you still feel it completely invalidates Kirby and / or Factom then explain it in a clar way or debate him here on the topic...from the interview I just don't see it as being that bad.  I could certainly be wrong but I'd need a lot more to reach that conclusion.
I am sorry but I don't want to point fingers at "worse" examples of CEO missteps, it's not productive, not fair to them ...especially as in many cases I have no idea if the company is great or terrible.   I'm not going to badmouth a CEO or an entire company unless I have a very solid reason.  Even a bad business model isn't enough unless I am speaking in private such as in discussion with investors.  I hope everyone succeeds, even clowns.
I also don't want to get into a long debate with you about why this company or that company or CEO is bad or good or why I included one on the list and not the other.   Unless I've spent detailed time, in person, with the team and deeply reviewed the process then I won't speak about it - especially negatively.
If you want examples, listen to past episodes of Let's Talk Bitcoin -- they are sharp, sometimes tough interviewers and on several occasions the CEOs have had cringeworthy responses.   
Even in those cases it doesn't necessarily mean the company is bad.....and even if the company is bad it doesn't mean it is due to fraud, it is more often incompetence.

@_date: 2015-08-03 21:00:35
Not a fair title.  At worst, he goofed on 2 minutes in a 22 minuted interview.  That's a BIG difference from not knowing what he's doing.
Watch the whole thing, these are extremely complex issues and 99.99% of the general public would have no earthly comprehension of what this topic is about.  He explained complex stuff with ease.
There are many damn good CEOs who actually speak quite simply about things or mess up in interviews or focus on other areas of specialty Etc.    I think in this case it was none of those things, but simply a matter of Peter and Chris not quite speaking about the same thing and Peter having a chance to formulate an articulate answer.
Anyone who has done lots of interviews has had this come up....you feel stumped on something and then later realize that either you didn't really understand the question or the interviewer didn't understand the context or both.
There are CEOs, right in this space, who even after thinking about a question....for weeks...still can't do things as basic as articulate what the business does, what problem it solves or how it makes money.

Amazing the effort select people will go to in order to be negative rather than positively contribute.
Since the false claim that the Bitcoin Foundation "died" a few weeks ago, we finalized the next DevCore conference which will include top speakers such as Gavin and Jeff Garzik,  we continued funding of Bitcoin.org, one of the largest Bitcoin education sites, we had many members make press comments, we used our speaker referral service to match a few key speakers with even organizers, we funded the Bit Nodes project, held a board meeting and worked on several committees.
The website was indeed down (although not for a whole week as claimed) because it is being migrated over to a new server and completely new site as we speak.
Not sure how this barely even mildly clever idea of putting the Bitcoin Foundation name on a website memorial designed for mourning people is at all productive or helpful to Bitcoin.
The time, energy and $55 fee to virtual memorials that someone spent for this could have been better spent doing something to actually help Bitcoin.
We are not perfect.  The Executive Director and all board members are completely volunteer positions with no compensation or financial reward for the many hours of work.  If someone wants to help us improve or work on their own or for another organization that does something productive for Bitcoin they are always welcome.

Total lie / BS -- I never, ever said Paycoin accusations were unfounded.  I never said anything close to that.  I said Garza was a fraud, said Paycoin is a scam, I placed a bounty for information to help gather evidence on them etc.
I did say that Moe, the Miami conference organizer was not a fraudster / scammer for accepting Paycoin as a sponsor and allowing Garza to speak.  That's a massive difference and I stand by that statement.  Conferences are a lot of work and it is understandable if organizers have something slip through their review process and at the time Moe accepted the sponsorship, Paycoin and especially it's issues were not as well known to many.  I think everyone should be allowed to speak, even Maddoff or Karpeles or Garza etc. so that their victims can face them.
The other "bad projects" in history do you refer to don't exist.
I'm not going to get into pointing fingers at which CEOs suck.  You might be denying that they exist and have a view that all CEOs are perfect...that seems strange.  Clearly there are bad CEOs who can't articulate things.  Or are you claiming that Kirby is in a class by himself as the very worst and most inarticulate CEO ever?
Are some of the bad CEO companies scams?  Sure, some are just plain incompetent or have poorly thought through business models.
Kirby answered the question here.  If you think this invalidates the entire Factom project as some sort of smoking gun, that's your right.  I just disagree.

He didn't vouch for Karpeles, he said Gox had statements indicating fiat assets.  When they shut down Gox did indeed have fiat assets.  He never, ever claimed to do an audit of the coins ...and he certainly did not claim that Gox was or would be safe many months later....even an audit from a major accounting firm does not guarantee the future stability of a company.
This is also a continual red herring to attack him on every post for this old news.  Did any actual person really make a decision to keep Bitcoin assets at Gox because of what Roger said about fiat assets months earlier?  If so then it was bad judgement, not on Ver.

How about getting full facts before making an allegation and then asking for comment from the person you are accusing?
If you think Roger Ver is scamming people to make $1 at a time by promoting bad wallets then you don't know Roger very well.
Roger has done a lot for Bitcoin and has complex investments and business interests.  A very likely guess is that someone other than Roger programmed this on the website in an effort to be interactive.  The very worst case scenario would be that Roger himself programmed this page in an effort to make some coffee money for himself.  If that was the case, and I sincerely doubt it, then it might warrant a note to him that says "Gee Roger, I think the site can be improved by not using this method as it could bump bad wallets higher."  
If he didn't respond satisfactorily and you had evidence he owned these addresses and you discussed it with him and it still really bothered you, then come on Reddit and say "I don't agree with how Roger is managing his own website that he owns for the following reasons."

Someone got scammed by this email address more recently.
When I hosted a private Bitcoin retreat called Satoshi Roundtable, some poor young guy figured out the location and showed up uninvited thinking Satoshi had invited him...because of the email.
Security told me that someone was trying to get in and I went out to meet him and he said Satoshi invited him.  At first that annoyed me because I thought he was being a wise guy - then I realized that he actually believed that Satoshi invited him due to the GMX email.
Fortunately we had in attendance a mess of people who knew a lot about both security, email and Bitcoin and Satoshi.  Some immediately dismissed it, others investigated further but after some time the general consensus was that the email was definitely a scam and not related in any way to Satoshi.  (Which would also mean the "I am not Dorian Nakamoto" message was almost certainly false.)

Article full of incorrect info, incorrect speculation and anger over issues from nearly two years ago and two Executive Directors ago.
All I can answer for is what we've done since I came aboard, what we are doing now and what I have personally done.  Spending was far too high in the glory days of $800 Bitcoins -- no one who made those decisions is still with the organization and I'm not going to second guess those who made decisions in a different environment.  It's not productive.
If his argument is that the foundation should "die" because he doesn't like the ZapChain answers of an Executive Director who served two terms ago I can't fight that battle.   
The whole argument of destroying the foundation is a tired, old and overdone argument by people often playing to Reddit upvotes....and also almost always people who have not offered to help, have not done thier own volunteer or advocacy work in the space and who have little to offer.
Far more productive to focus on how we all, including Bitcoin Foundation, can be the most beneficial to Bitcoin going forward.
In that regard we've continued funding bitcoin.org, bitnodes project, are still planning world class events, our legal committee will continue to fight bad regs and the education committee continue to work on adoption.

Queue the Mt Gox Roger haters:
"Months before its collapse, Roger (completely accurately) stated that Mt Gox had FIAT assets by looking at thier bank account because he coincidentally lived next door.  Therefor the entire collapse / hack of BITCOIN assets long afterwards is his fault because we thought that someone once verifying that fiat assets existed meant that forever and ever it also automatically verified that Bitcoin assets were there also and always would be no matter how much the company changed or went down hill.
Even though he had no financial motive to do so, is not and never claimed to be an auditor and he only spoke about fiat assets (which, by the way we're still there after the collapse) we should blame him for bitcoin losses."

There was a lot of heavy spending and Bitcoin went down in price a lot -- these comments came from Jon who was Executive Director two terms ago.  I think the spending was too high, we all likely think that at this stage -- but I cant second guess the decisions made by others in a fast moving time when Bitcoins where at $1000.  It's not super productive to dwell on old news that's been rehashed many times.  No one involved in these decisions is still with the foundation - I think they did the best they could at the time.  It makes no sense to attack people today for past actions or attack the organization today when we have an entirely different team and structure.

I never discussed blocksize or any related matter with MGT, I never advised anyone there to take any course of action or opinion on capacity or mining.
I never received any compensation from them and have not spoken to anyone at the company for months.  I saw John briefly at a dinner in Miami but didn't have the chance to talk.
I own no stock in MGT.
This attack is founded in dishonestly with the intention of implying that this is recent news and / or affects my opinion on capacity.
It's a lot better and more productive if people actually focus on what people actually do and say.

Meh,  I don't see much of a problem, we have bigger fish to fry.
Hearn was a developer and earned that title just as an artist who hasn't painted in two years is still an artist.

@_date: 2017-04-16 15:38:58
First off there is no "core" to defend as in a noun describing people.  The core software project is one thing, the developers on it another thing...and they should be defended and I do defend them.  For example it's not fair to hold them accountable as a group since there are diverse members.  I think it's a mistake for anyone in Bitcoin to be against "core" as if it's people...it's not...it's a software project that belongs to all of us.  All of us can contribute and comment if able to add value.  If someone doesn't agree with a specific developer then they should debate those tech differences in an open and uncensored forum

Strawman - of course not.
But core devs, if they are not happy with CEOs not listening to them and doing things like threatening to support a contentious fork should work extra hard to have positive, constructive communications.
I don't think the intent of this tweet was to inform or help build consensus but to try to make the other guys look bad.   I think we can all do better than this.

He has an asset worth over a million dollars, I don't think it's fair for anyone to expect him to be obligated to do anything especially generous with it just as we don't expect people nice houses to let people stay over.
Bitcoin.org is a different story.  We at Bitcoin Foundation have funded it for quite a while now to help keep in unbiased.
We can't expect someone else to do what we do as a non profit.  Especially since we not only receive no thanks for it, we basically never get donations of people offering to help us pay for it....in fact people routinely criticise us.  :) 
Personally if I owned Bitcoin.com I'd either sell it for seven figures or determine a way to maximize revenue on it.

It's not flip flopping if I say "Core has significant communications issues" then say "Roger is not out to destroy Bitcoin" then say "Mining is too centralized" then say "core supporters make it difficult to support thier cause" etc.    all those statements can be true but each supports a different "side" 
I pointed out the other day to someone a factual inaccuracy about someone on the "other side" they were complaining about ...the reply was "don't you see what he's doing to Bitcoin".   That kind of crap thinking has no place here

I spoke to them several times and offered to get together volunteers or a committee but it didn't go anywhere -- it's not at all clear what they want, what we can do, who is in charge or how to work it.   
A couple complained about Bitcoin not being more involved but it's really not clear what they want / how we can participate.
If someone who is in charge can provide a clear idea of what is needed it would be easy to put together.
We need a developer volunteer or someone who understands both worlds.  Or someone interested in funding someone.   The person quoted in the article emailed me, then another person emailed after that and seemed to back off from it.
It's one of those things where no one seems really motivated to do anything or where no one has the time.

I would think the author would have noticed that the current system of never ending grudges is not only not working, it's a threat to Bitcoin.  
It's hard to take seriously someone who dismisses a call to "let go of the past" by referring me to director of the "Vessenes Foundation" I never met Vessenes, never worked with him and never supported him -- I'm a part time volunteer at a non-profit that Vessenes was involved with three administrations before I volunteered.   The silly name calling is a good example of why letting go of ancient history can be a way to move on.

I assume you are being sarcastic.  Do you believe people have a right to privacy?
Suppose we recorded the sessions and live streamed....what if Adam Back and Brian Armstrong and five others grab a table together at lunch -- do we bring the cameras over?
People have a right to privacy.
In this context it is not only respectful but it's MORE effective than having a public issue.  People don't want to lose face and will always act differently in front of a camera.
What if someone is being too stubborn for example?  In private it's very easy for someone to call them out.  In public, wise people would not embarrass someone this way on an open stage...and if they did it would make things work worse. 
If a CEO is in private he might say "hey guys, we are really concerned about XYZ - if it's not fixed we will need to make layoffs" - if they say that in public it could self sabotage them and cause employee panic.
One session is going to be discussing the biggest threats to Bitcoin what if a security expert is concerned about a vulnerability should he let the world know or talk with engineers and work on fixing it? 
Many many other examples.

Buffet is a different type of fund -- he buys equities directly.  It's actually a good strategy and if I had $20 billion I'd put a good chunk into stocks directly --- but we couldn't assume we'd do as well as Buffet - in fact it's almost impossible.
Also, Buffet is not diversified - he doesn't do venture capital much international or even much tech.  No way he'd buy Bitcoin

Just to be clear -- this is NOT the same or related to the Satoshi Roundtable - that's an event held in a couple weeks that will have many CEOs and developers and we will discuss scaling.
This group asked me to sign the letter, I wish I knew they were also calling it Roundtable because two things working on scaling both called Roundtable the same month could be confusing.
(And for anyone who is about to ask) the reason I opted not to sign it is because, while I agree in principle to much of the letter I think it could be more divisive and that there are more productive ways forward for right now.

For this post I'm specifically talking about people with $20 billion or more.

Olivier is no longer affiliated with the Bitcoin Foundation.
The Bitcoin Foundation is neutral because at this time they is no clear consensus from members and we want to represent all members.
However there is no charter that would prevent the Bitcoin Foundation from supporting one implementation over another.   Also, individual board members and staff are welcome to support whatever technical solution they choose.

I listed half a dozen political figures and others who share the same political views.  
I don't use the foundation to promote a political agenda.  The foundation has not made political statements.  
I don't recall attacking Coin Center on Reddit - I said what I had to say months and months ago and have declined interviews on the topic - I'd really like to focus on what we agree on and work to build bridges even if I disagree with a person or organization on a method or topic.  
Baffling that you think that people who are regulated and registered as licensed supervisors / compliance etc would not understand regulation but people who read about it in a book would.  It's like saying pilots don't understand the FAA.  
Should Congressman Thomas Massie be banned from government?   Does he not understand things?  Is he a 'wing nut'?   My political views are exactly the same as his and millions of other people.

They were not malicious --  I can see why someone would think they were biased but that was not the point.
I support SegWit (!)
The entire purpose of not including it was because I was curious what replies would be other than this.
Its like if you and I both want Italian food ---  but our friends are arguing over it and I say - "okay, given the choice of Mexican food vs Chinese food, what would you pick"
I know analogies suck ---  but the point was not to be biased.

I know exactly how they squandered the money.  We don't need to "figure out" anything.   You were talking about an entirely different thing with accusations there was wrongdoing.
I've never seen any evidence of illegal acts at all.  The Bitcoin price skyrocketed in 2013 ...they had a ton of coins...so they spent at way too high a rate...Bitcoin crashed from 1100 to 250 right when spending was up.  It's textbook bad startup spending, happens all the time.  It sucks, the decisions made were bad.  What specifically could I have done?  Hire a private investigator?  What would they have looked into exactly?

You don't want to get whipsawed on taxes etc . 
The ultra rich rarely mess with their own money -- they are not going to spend hours (and I guarantee it would be many hours) dealing with thier bank and wires and Coinbase or whoever.   Same reason that people who make $500k/ hr rarely did returnable bottles out of the trash

Head / Chief Investment Officer working for a single family office with $20 billion could make anywhere from $500k to $3 million or more -- depends on many factors: how complex the investments, if they own thier own firm or work directly for the family, how the family views the job and if there is a bonus structure.

When people are in public with media they are speaking to two audiences - the people they are taking to and the public.   This creates more of a desire to save face, "win" etc.

Nullc is right, there is a difference between being transparent about what you actually do and being secret in planning or discussing.
If you are in a private setting you can ask "Hey, maybe Stanford University wants to partner with us on this" or "Gee, I heard this guy is a con artist, what did you hear?" without harming a potential partner, creating drama or hurting the name of someone who might be innocent.

These issues are highly, highly complex and technically involved.  To be honest, even in a small group we have a problem of getting off track and people ask questions which are not helpful in getting a real solution.

You've said that many many times - I think that's a strange view - so we have a different political philosophy than you - not a major deal - 60-70+% of the people on this list have the same views including people like Patrick Byrne -- Congressman Thomas Massie almost attended etc. 
I don't attack Coincenter every chance I can- I spoke with Jerry in Miami - just recently I and the Bitcoin Foundation complemented him on one of their positions.  
Political groups are used to dealing with a variety of opinions - my views are certainly no more radical than Sanders or Trump... two leading candidates.

What makes you think "hundreds of thousands" of people use it without these companies?   I'm talking about a broad cross section of companies:  miners, wallets, exchanges, investors etc.

I think this really stems from lack of understanding about what "core" is.
Anyone using that term as a noun to describe people is doing a disservice to productive discussion.
There is no "core" in terms of people.  It's a software project that belongs to all of us.
We should stop using that term in that way.
Now if there are issues with specific people or specific devs those should be addressed...if there are even issues with the process itself then those should be improved.
This isn't US politics.  We don't need "sides" -- we are all part of core and everyone should encourage open and fair scientific driven discussion about what should be included in Bitcoin.

One problem with media and streaming is that people are playing to an audience as well as to the person they are talking to....it's human nature and makes people want to "win" arguments more than solutions -- just like social media/ Reddit.
Think of this like a big dinner -- we're gonna gather a bunch of people, have some chats, eat some food and drink some beers.   I don't make any promises that it will solve the debate or even that it will help -- but I'm pretty sure that getting everyone together in a relaxed environment won't hurt...

I didn't attack any tweets a few days ago -- I haven't mentioned him in any negative way in months other than when you regularly bring up your opinion of how Coin Center is right and I'm wrong.   
Okay, have your opinion.  That's certainly fine.  What I find amusing is your inability to accept that any countering opinion is legitimate.
I've actually worked with regulators and actually been regulated for deals of more size than all Bitcoin combined and since before Jerry even had a professional job.  Fact is, he has never actually been regulated, never been subject to the types of laws he thinks are a good idea, never run a business in a regulated industry, never been a compliance officer, supervisor or other person with legal responsibility to comply with regulations nor has he ever been supervised by any such people.  He's never met regulators from the perspective of a regulated business.  I've don't all those things.  I've been regulated by a dozen regulators on three continents, I've been licences as a FINRA supervisor, completed the Registered Investment Advisor Law Exam, been regulated by the SEC, subject DOL, IRS regs, regs of the now defunct Pension Welfare Benefits Admin and so on -- not to mention numerous other regulators outside the US.
I'm sure he's a nice guy and many people I respect like him a lot.  I'd love to find common ground on these issues but he's simply completely naive and wrongheaded in his approach and it will harm this industry more than it helps it.  
I really don't understand your obsession with this - I don't think about Jerry, I haven't criticized him in ages, and am not sitting here trying to fight Coin Center.  I invited him to my event, I invited many people from the pro-regulation angle, they honestly don't talk about these things with industry much then seem surprised when someone like the EFF or Andreas criticizes them.  The Bitcoin Foundation has no political leaning and we have no focus on lobbying or asking for new regs.
Things work when people recognize that there are different and valid opinions.  Anyone we cannot accept such basic ideas and work with others doesn't belong in a non profit or lobbying.

Show me where I said "people are more likely to be killed by govt than any other way".   I also didn't claim Britto was wrong a few days ago.  It is unsurprising that your facts are wrong because you seem to be living in some sort of delusional world where you think everyone who disagrees with you, even the EFF, doesn't know what they are talking about.
Not surprising someone in the FAA would think pilots don't know what they are talking about,  DC is filled with hundreds of thousands of employees living off the tax wages of those of us who actually produce something people want and pay for.   It's common for the people in government offices who cause massive damage to our economy with strangling regulations to not understand the damage they do.
Your utter and astounding cluelessness about who the real world operates, the real and massively damaging effects of regulation is no doubt informed by your world view as a person who has lived off of regulation and been paid by the rest of us who regulation stands in the way of.
Lack of logic, complete inflexibility, lack of real world experience or knowledge of how the world actually works and an unbounding arrogance that doesn't allow you to consider the opinions of others as valid:   I'm sure you make an excellent government employee.

It's not political agenda vs. Bitcoin it's a difference of opinion on what's best for Bitcoin. 
Jerry has done some good things but I disagree with the effectiveness of others. Unlike Jerry and most people in the industry 
I have actually been regulated and governed by financial regulators.  I've had annual audits, meetings etc for 20 years I've met and worked with regulators much longer than most people in this space -- I've been an expert witness, cooperated with law enforcement numerous times - and that experience forms my opinion - which is that I think technical rather than regulatory solutions should be pursued whenever possible and I agree with the EFF that it is a bad idea to proactively ask for new laws and regulations governing Bitcoin - I also think it's a bad idea to proactively partner with agencies like the DHS who have miserable records on quality control, ethics and following the law. 
You might just consider that different people have different opinions on the best way to move this tech forward.
When most of the industry was fawning over Lawsky and thrilled that he was creating the Bitlicense - I gave a warning -- turns out I was exactly right and the proposal he made was terrible.   It took months and millions of dollars to soften the worst provisions of Bitlicense and as it exists now it still hinders business.  
You act as if I'm sacrificing goats on the lawn of the White House - my views are hardly that radical and are actually in line with most people -- within Bitcoin it's the same way.   I'm suggesting we work to find better ways than new laws.  That's all

You were removed because you were not invited and were not registered.   
 It is a private event and and the fact that it is in a semi public location does not entitle you to attend, let alone record people without their knowledge.   
You also violated both the rules of the venue as well as the trust of the participants who attended for the purpose of working on serious issues, not creating content for a podcast.  
It is unacceptable to record private conversations without permission or knowledge of the people involved.

Unfortunately the market doesn't like SegWit enough to hit 95%, they've been saying this for a while.
The Chinese miners clearly said what they wanted and it was even put into an agreement in HK.   I know this agreement is controversial and each side blames the other for it not being followed...but the desires of the miners were clear back then.
Many of companies have also spoken.
To bad Core have been working on all this testing for the last year or two.  I thought SW first then HF was a plan.
It seems the only way out of this are to compromise or redouble efforts to explain the reasons to people.

I agree with most of what you said 
@_date: 2016-02-25 19:31:14
Well, I think you have a very different view of the world than most people.
Bitlicense history is not revisionist - unless you are one of the small minority who liked the first version proposed by Lawsky more than the revised one.
I have a perfectly reasonable understanding of what regulators do, as I mentioned I have been under jurisdiction of multiple financial regulators for over 20 years.   I understand what Jerry does as well, it's very clear -- it's discussed right on the website.   He and CoinCenter participated in the Blockchain Alliance, which I think is a bad idea.   He supported California AB 1326 which asked for new laws governing Bitcoin.   The EFF - who has far more experience on this than CoinCenter, agreed with me.  Is the EFF crazy?
Now you can say that EFF is wrong, that's fine.  But it's ridiculous to paint every opinion other than your own as if it's some sort of radical extermism.   Apple computer stands against creating an FBI backdoor for example, I doubt they would support something like Blockchain Alliance if they were in Bitcoin.   Many companies who are in Bitcoin declined the invite and are absent from the list.  Are they all "wing nuts"?  
I don't know what particular views you are so concerned about -- the main thing you keep obsessing about is CoinCenter, mainly based on comments I made many months ago.  Let it go.
What Bitcoin speech or comment do you find so radical?  For non Bitcoin political views most of my views are in line with most people.  I'm anti war (most of the population), pro gun rights (majority of the population), against domestic spying, against torture, in favor of limiting the size of govt, legalizing drugs, in favor of gay marriage etc. these are the main issues I care and speak about on my personal time and they are in line with many people.
Do you consider Patrick Byrne to be some sort of insane radical?  Adam Back?  Peter Thiel?  David Koch?  Milton Freidman?  Jeff Bezos?  Congressman Amash?  Congressman Massie?  Ron Paul, Gov Gary Johnson, John Stossel?  etc. etc. etc.
Not sure what kind of world you are from but in the real world of international diplomacy and business people have differing opinions and they recognize that this is a normal thing.   I've met dozens of heads of state, major CEOs, ambassadors and advises some of the largest most sophisticated investors in the world.   
You seem to have a strange obsession with Jerry and your unshakable belief that he is not only right but the only possible option and that those who disagree with him are harming Bitcoin or should stay neutral because they are crazy radicals.
I haven't made a negative comment about Jerry in months other than speaking with you - we have different beliefs informed by different knowledge and life experience.  His views are perfectly valid and I'd love to find common ground - on Fen 15 I tweeted in support of Coin Center's MSB comments.
The official stance on regulation by the foundation (which I wrote) simply says "We encourage technical solutions over regulatory whenever possible and will educate global regulators on these and other issues"  hardly radical.
Also, by the way, Bitcoin Foundation is an international organization so the view on politics and laws has to consider this -- we cannot make some blanket statement that "we support regulators" or even that "we support the law" because with an international org we have members in places where the law includes clear violations of human rights, execution of bloggers etc.

Crazy talk.  Rogers owns a lot of Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-04-28 19:15:51
Too much mud slinging.
It should never have become normal for personal attacks to regularly occur in this.
This loses a lot of credibility because it opens with the same old tired and false smear attack.
1- Roger did NOT "vouch" for Mt. Gox - he said he looked at the bank records while showed they had fiat
2- Gox DID INDEED have that fiat - what he said was true 
3- Roger is not an auditor - no one should take a video statement from an interested party / community member as an audit -- even still, what he said was true and accurate 
4- EVERYTHING he said during the Gox issue about fiat was TRUE 
5- Despite it being true he still apologized for eve making any statement 
6- he never said anything about the coins, never claimed to have audited or reviewed them in any way
7-  even IF Roger had said the coins were there (which he DIDNT!) then anyone with any common sense would know that such a statement would have only been true at the time....not serving as a guarantee in perpetuity for all time in the future.
So the claim that some act of Rogers "resulted in massive losses to thousands of Bitcoiners" is utter and absolute garbage. 
It's doubtful anyone logical lost any money because of Roger on Gox.   
The ONLY way this would have been possible to lose. Only is if they said "Gee...Roger said Gox had fiat months and months ago...despite numerous red flags and other issues I'm going to assume that here, the following year, that Gox has coins even though no one looked at those coins."   It just doesn't hold water.  I don't think such people exist but if they do then I feel sorry for them thinking that a statement about fiat would be relevant about Bitcoins the following year.
So once past that incorrect statement ... it says he's subverting Bitcoins open source decentralized development.  How exactly?  Is the claim that only certain people or groups are allowed to fund development?
Why can't we discuss objective technical facts rather than result to personal attacks based on a foundation of false statements?

So ridiculous-- your entire post is based off a faulty assumption that there was some smoking gun of wrongdoing.  There's nothing to investigate and nothing to find out.
We know where the money went.
Foundation had $5 mil or so peak funding at peak prices of $1100 or so per Bitcoin.
The price drop alone drops that $5 million to around $1.5 million.   They spent about $500k / year on salaries for Wladmir, Cory and Gavin -- the Amsterdam event made $2 mil or so but cost 2.5 so there's another 500k gone.   
So over two years (to 2015) that leaves only 500k or so left ...this was mainly spent on salaries over those two years.    There's also things like computers, legal costs, PR etc, there were grants to fund Bitnodes and other projects, funding of the Bitcoin.org website, office rent etc. 
In 2013 when Bitcoin went from $100 to $1000 the foundation went from having $500k to $5 million -- hype was crazy, donations were pouring in and the price was rocketing with no end in site.  They made some stupid spending decisions, over extended, kept the money in Bitcoin and then where hit with both the Bitcoin price crash and lack of funds from donors.
It sucks but it's really straightforward.   There isn't anything more to it or sinister.
Where else do you think the money went?

Aside from something crazy like the leader of a country declaring Bitcoin the enemy.   Unfortunately I think that a dozen or so very well placed, long term or co-opted people could do massive harm to Bitcoin almost, but not quite enough to essentially "bring it down".
There would also have to be more than just the dozen involved.
I think this could only be only done by a government or absolutely massive criminal enterprise like the Sinaloa cartel or maybe a terrorist network.
It would take at least tens of millions of dollars, ruthlessness and some impunity with the law as well as far reaching international connections in multiple major countries where this kind of thing is not easy to do.
Basically you'd get the top ten miners and a couple of the top ten influencers and give them a carrot / stick of "do this and we give you $80 million, don't do it and we kill everyone you ever loved in front of you and by the way we already have them in custody".   
Then they'd have to plan a coordinated attack designed to mess up the network as much as possible - running a broken hard fork with known vulnerabilities followed by another and another, spamming the main original fork, having exchanges drop the listing of the original Bitcoin etc.
Fortunately this becomes increasingly difficult and unlikely.  The time for governments to stop this would have been four years ago before money, VCs, major corporations were involved.
Still if a leader of a major nation set his/ her sights on messing with Bitcoin they could wreak a lot of havoc.

If you could triple your money every three months for four years then £1000 pounds would grow to £43,046,721,000 making you one of the top five richest people on earth.
Presuming that 100 or so other OneCoiners did the same thing and counting those who started earlier or with more, they would have a large portion of the money on planet earth, and would completely dominate the Forbes list.  
They would have so much so that it would imbalance and disrupt overall global wealth distribution more than that of of a wealthy country like Germany.

I don't see how this bill was deregulatory as they claimed.  I asked many times for them to explain it.  They have no interest in engaging with people who are not in favor of more regulation.
Simple way to look at it:  would Bitcoin companies be better or worse off today if the first version had passed?   Clearly they would not be better off.  No.  They'd have a new licensing process and be subject to great discretion and whims of the bureaucrats who administer it.
If they disliked rhe "confusing obligations of traditional money transmission licensing" why didn't they work to have those repealed or have exemptions added?  
Sure new regs could be deregulatory - that wasn't the case with this, it isn't the case with the framework suggestions and in fact I don't know of any time CoinCenter has ever spoken against any regulation ever.  Have they?

You are distorting the record of what you are actually doing.
Your framework/ roadmap is not an effort to limit regulation but and effort to encourage lawmakers to pass new laws based on your recommendations. 
Your framework's intro describes it as offering "language for the essential components of any digital currency law" such as "who should be regulated".
Take California AB1326 for example:
- CoinCenter, "proudly" "helped craft" (your words) this piece of bad legislation last year
- CoinCenter wrote a letter asking legislators to support it on July 7, 2015 in which you said the bill had "many excellent features"
- EFF called this bill a "license to kill innovation" and many others stood against it
- in August 2015, a coalition of companies including the EFF, Gem, Blockstream, Taskforce.is, Automatic (creators of Wordpress), BitWage, COPIA, Internet Archive, Purse, Demand Progress, Bolt and Backslash stood AGAINST it and created nobitcoinlicence.org
- CoinCenter stood FOR it
- those of us who were against it won and CoinCenter lost, the law was shelved 
- this year, the failed bill was brought up again, in an even worse form than before 
- CoinCenter (despite later saying in a tweet that you were "happy" it was dropped) NEVER ONCE ASKED for this bill to be dropped - you instead sent a 7 page letter which asked for it to be changed to your "framework" with much of the same bad language the bill had the first time you failed and legislators did not follow your advice to pass it
- once again, EFF, joined by members of the coalition, Blockstream, me, Colin Gallagher and others asked for the bill to be dropped
- CoinCenter did not ask for the bill to be dropped
- once again (for a second time), CoinCenter failed and those who were against the regulation prevailed and it was dropped
- after its second defeat, CoinCenter attempted to claim victory (in a tweet by Jerry Britto referenced above) when it's defeat was never something you wanted or asked for 
- after this second defeat you indicated that you would be "happy to work with" the bill's author once again for a THIRD shot at the twice failed legislation 
You are working with a large staff yet your efforts in this proved to be less effective than the EFF, some part time advocates and some companies that don't even focus on this area.
The simple fact is that if you had succeeded with what you asked of the California legislature, we'd now have more Bitcoin regulation in California.
One of your arguments for these failed tactics seems to be "if we don't help make regulations, the lawmakers will pass even worse ones".   The results of AB1326 show otherwise; clearly getting the entire bill dropped was a worthwhile ask because that is what was accomplished.  Why didn't you ever once ask for the bill to be dropped?  
This bill was defeated twice in spite of your efforts which did not attempt to defeat it.
Rather than learning from your twice failed attempts, you now seek to try a third time to work with the same failed legislator to again regulate Bitcoin.  
Do you have indication from the industry and users that anyone wants to regulate Bitcoin in California other than Dababnah (the bill's author) and CoinCenter?
You have painted the false narrative of this being people who are against any dialogue with regulators and lawmakers versus a "sane" approach.  In reality, every group who was part of the coalition has extensive experience with working with lawmakers, many of them quite a bit more than you.  Just because we don't want terrible regulation does not mean we don't wish to engage.
Your tactics have proven ineffective and are likely not only not a representation of what users and the industry wants but harmful to Bitcoin. 
If you are going to promote your record you should be accurate about what you are actually doing.

IMHO people make this way too complex.  I like simplicity.
1) get an old crap laptop that will never be on the internet again (or use a boot disk with Linux / Ubuntu)
2) grab bitaddress.org and save the html / out it on the laptop with a USB 
3) use it to create 200 paper wallets 
4) print three copies of each using a dumb printer
5) put a copy of each in a safe, a bank and a safe location
6) Keep a copy of the public address for all of them and have them numbered for tracking 
7) use them
This is simple, nearly foolproof, not subject to future bad tech and is as secure as the physical location - a safe deposit box or whatever.
As an added bonus you can password protect these wallets with an additional password (called BIP 38) --- so even the "secure location" doesn't need to be Fort Knox
If you ever lose one you still have the other two backups 
You can move these to a wallet any time
You can bury/ hide the wallets and don't need to access them to send money to them 
If password protected you can carry a couple around for emergencies 
It's a simple and effective system

We should be very cautious about supporting something based on the name or stated intent...Congress has a long track record of doing things which accomplish exactly the opposite of the stated intentions.
Let's see what form this actually comes in, what the wording is and what the ramifications are.
If it entails actual protections of Bitcoin and blockchain tech - such as making it a violation of Federal law for regulators to interfere, great.  But that's very, very doubtful.  Much more likely it will be something that's marketed as "promoting blockchain" the same way the Patriot Act promoted patriotism or Operation Iraqi Freedom promoted freedom.

It only takes one person, the US president.
Step 1)  he calls the CIA and FBI and Atty General into the situation room and makes an executive order indicating that Bitcoin is a threat to national security and that all holders should be investigated to the full extent of the law for any possible violations of any kind.  For foreign areas the CIA is ordered to destroy and disrupt wherever possible.  Miner farms suspiciously catch fire, exchanges are hacked more and developers die in car accidents, admins of forums like this are hacked and tens of thousands of fake accounts flood the discussion boards.   Millions of 1 cent transactions clog the network and Bitcoin people find themselves and families investigated by the IRS, added to the "no fly" list etc.
The FBI then raids every single miner and startup and looks for anything from pirated software to tax violations and arrests every single person for anything they can.  Even in cases of no wrongdoing the companies and individuals are tied up in investigations.
Step 2 he calls the Premer of China and the leaders of Russia, Japan and the EU etc. to make a coalition and says that he believes this is a matter of the highest level of importance / "you are with us or against us" and that the US believes that any country supporting Bitcoin is making an act of aggression against the US and that stamping out this terror will be seen very favorably with trade deals etc.
Step 3 He makes a national address to to the people to coincide with calls to Congress to vote to declare ownership of Bitcoin a felony - Congress likely passes this if enough PR is thrown at it - if they don't pass the law, doesn't matter, the states will do enough without it
Step 4 He sends national security letters to Google, Reddit, Facebook etc requesting that all discussion of this topic be blacklisted under grounds of national security and that the accounts of all people involved with this be frozen - most companies would comply depending on the level of threat he makes 
Bitcoin is less than $10 billion and no country would think twice about not doing what the US said over such a small amount whether they agreed or not.

As far as a lawyer you might consider holding off for a few days-  a lawyer is very unlikely to take this on contingency so depending on your financial situation be careful of racking up bills -- also lawyers care less about helping plaintiffs on criminal matters since charges are brought by the government, not the victims usually.   Also, most lawyers don't have the most basic understanding of Bitcoin.   The first thing they'd say is to not contact the thief, so it could limit options.   Maybe talk to a couple lawyers while you gether info and wait a few days.
Other ideas:
Check the email accounts on the computer the thief used.
Check the cache and history and visited sites to see what websites were visited.
Good news is that this was more of a crime of opportunity than a professional hack...so hopefully he didn't do as good a job of covering his footsteps as a pro hacker would have.
If he was careless, he could have looked up a bitcoin exchange or other account that he planned to send it to (so if you see that XYZ exchange was visited, that's a clue)
Also, if he was lazy he might have emailed the QR code or address he sent it to (or generated it on the same computer) -- otherwise he'd have had to type it out by hand which is a real pain.   So there could be an email sent to the PC that has this address - check deleted emails etc.
Grab those social media posts you mentioned where the thief discussed his spending new money.
Also:   See if you can resolve this without law enforcement - hacking is a serious crime and although this guy sounds like the lowest form of scumbag you may want to think carefully before his entire life is ruined and he spends perhaps even as much as 20 years in jail without you getting the money back -- better option would be for a lawyer to negotiate something where he pays your family back, learns his lesson and stays out of jail or gets a lesser sentence.

Technical analysis is real and has real merit.  However I think it’s way overdone, especially for Bitcoin and crypto.  Much more important to Bitcoin than the daily price moves and charts is the long term thesis:  is this better money and will it work.   That’s the driver of Bitcoin, not a chart.
Like many tools, it’s just one tool in the arsenal that people should have and use.

@_date: 2015-04-17 17:38:29
It's that really the best and most accurate headline you can create from your interview with me George?
At the time you interviewed me I said that I had a high priority of releasing financial records and a goal of releasing the last three years form 990s for the foundation publicly.
I have been in the role as Exec Director for about 48 hours at the time of your email interview -- the IRS form 990 has not even been completed or filed.  I am in the process of working to gather financial data about the foundation and make sure the form 880 is completed and then will release it.
I will do this as fast as humanly possible -- I do not personally complete the form and have no ability to do so in a period of a week.  I am doing conference calls with the bookkeeper, accountant and legal council this week.  It would be ridiculous and irresponsible to promise something done by a certain date when I have not even had the opportunity to speak with the people working on these matters or be updated about the status,
It may may a good headline to make it seem as if I am nonchalantly indifferent about releasing data that I proactively said I wanted to release because I "don't know" when it will be completed but it's not fair or accurate.
@_date: 2015-04-15 16:31:07
That's easy enough although in practical implementation best practices may call for several multi-sig addresses.
It also would not give much insight as to where funds are going.  If you see 1000 BTC tomorrow and 500 the next day it could mean that the 500 was moved or spent but would not indicate what the spending was on.  We could work to issue reports which disclose the major expenditures ...provided they did not violate privacy such as staff pay, health insurance or other areas.
But overall, if the request is more transparent financial, yes I agree and will work on that.
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:22:03
Thanks!  There are a few challenges that I think will be addressed.
First is the type of structure that those with deep pockets are comfortable with -- they often want more control than an elected / independent foundation like ours can offer.   The other is economic and business realities they face.  I hope that there will be more options for this going forward in the form of new organizations, initiatives, crowdfunding and industry participation.
@_date: 2015-04-23 17:33:45
Thanks -- having just come into this role little more than a week ago my first priority is to get the Bitcoin Foundation financially viable -- part of that is to build trust with the community, supporters and companies by doing things like improving transparency.   Our financial reality is that we have very limited resources.  I'd be happy to ask people for funding for any number of initiatives (and even happier to accept money) but first I want to make them feel the Bitcoin Foundation is an organization that has governance and transparency standards that show we deserve those contributions.

Thanks, Erik is a good personal freind who I happen to agree with politicially on many subjects but this is separate from my work as ED and the organization.   I agree that the organization should not promote a political agenda.
The Bitcoin community and membership is generally very libertarian leaning so far more people in this space agree with these ideas than elsewhere.
I don't view the Bitcoin Foundation as a political organization or to move forward an agenda.  I'd like to be big tent and have members who are democrats, republicans, libertarians, liberals, conservatives, anarchists, and socialists.
We can find common ground in areas we all agree.
I have strong personal political opinions and have spoken about politics for ages, considered a run for Congress and so on -- I'll continue to do this on a personal level and at some points my personal political opinions may come across in speaking or other interactions but I don't intend to work on having the foundation be political or partisan.

The old 990s (typo not 880s sorry) already have been publicly availiable on the website for some time.  Tax season for non profits is right around now with most completing them by May 15.
I think your article is accurate -- your headline is just unfair as it gives the impression that I'm somehow lax on this or indifferent.
Of course I "don't know" when they will be released.  How could I possibly know that this early.  Prior to appointment I had no more data than any other member and I don't think any member could make such an estimate.
There is simply no way to do things faster than I already am.  As soon as I came aboard I requested documents about the status -- today was the earliest day I could schedule a call with the former operations person.  You seem to think it would be realistic for me to say on day one of the role "I will have all documents released within 100 days" or something.  This isn't possible without speaking to accountants and attorneys and internal people who are involved.

Yes, I'd like to post the financials.
When you say foundation meetings there are two types/ one is open meetings for members and those already are open.
The other type of meeting is board meetings.  
Some people have suggested we open these board meetings to everyone.  I understand the reason people have thought of this and appreciate the desire for transparency.  However there are several drawbacks of this: board meetings have confidential discussions about employees and decisions which are not yet made and therefor would not be appropriate to release publicly.
For example if we are exploring a partnership with XYZ company a board member should be able to freely say to other board members "I am concerned about this company because I think the CEO has a certain challenge." and have that remain private.
On the flip side a board member may say "We'd really like a partnership with ABC University it would be great" and not have that discussion public at a very early stage before even talking to the Univeristy.
Likewise internal compensation matters and several employee matters should remain confidential.
This is the reason that virtually all boards keep meetings private.  Board members should be able to speak freely and honestly without worries that privacy will be violated.

The fundraising was done originally to pay his salary and that was the main goal of Bitcoin Foundation at the start.  Faulting him for doing the job he was asked to do and taking a salary he and the members who donated it agreed on seems strange.  If he had NOT taken the job and salary then that would have been against the wishes of the people who contributed.
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:58:52
Personally I wouldn't advocate that unless I thought the foundation could not be of value.
I definitely think it can be of value to the space.
Whether the Bitcoin Foundation exists or not there will be central authorities and organizations which serve a similar role.
Just as this space can benefit from centralized media companies and other organizations I think it can benefit from work that a non-profit can do that a for profit company cannot do.
Take DevCore going on today for example -- this is something which helps Bitcoin.   Now we could just do this as individuals and Patrick or Gavin or Andreas or me or anyone else can run their own conference -- but then that places the same drawbacks of an organization on a single person or small group of people.   Even if it's three people who join together to create a conference...that's still a centralized organization.   
The alternatives are that we can have everything segmented into influential individuals like Andreas or Gavin -- drawback with this is inefficiency and those without the skill, reach or aptitude to duplicate those people are left with virtually no influence.
Or we can try to make everything as completely democratic and crowd based as possible -- this also has drawbacks in implementation, logistics and the simple fact that some things (like paying a bill for a venue) are best done by a single person or an organization.
Thanks for your thoughts.

As an organization I will encourage the Bitcoin Foundation to educate regulators and encourage technical solutions to their concerns over regulation -- I don't actually think that wading into regulatory fights is that effective for us right now -- I hope some other organization works to actively fight the most harmful of regulations.

One of the double edges of transparency is that it does not give an organization much time to discuss things and plan for a less-shocking rollout.
In this last case some members wanted to wait and plan and make organized announcements, others wanted to release information quickly for transparency sake.

Remember also we DID have a member vote mandate in the last elections....the candidate who won by far the largest margin, Olivier, ran on a platform of eliminating core dev.   He won the most votes by far.
The other reality is that they did not have the funding -- also the developers had other preferences.  Gavin has spoken publicly about the drawbacks of being paid by a member driven organization where 1000 people all think they own your time.
Unless you are pledging a few thousand coins, funding dev is just not something that would be possible.  I don't think Gavin woukd want to do it in that structure even if the foundation had unlimited cash.
All we can do is look at what we can do going forward.  Events like devcore and other initiatives around education etc. can help further development as well.
The Bitcoin Foundation can serve as a neutral party that can encourage more efforts from MIT, companies and similar groups to fund developers -- this is more decentralized and better in many ways anyway.   Even if you did donate that hypothetical few thousand coins I'd say that best efforts should be to focus on decentralized solutions like this.

I just don't see any demand for that removal of the position from either members or the broader Bitcoin community.
You are in the minority on this and my job is to represent the members and to some degree the larger community.  
I haven't had a single member, sponsor, corporate member, donor or anyone else ask us to remove Gavin.  I'm aware that there are rifts among developers -- as their always have been and always will be if the devs are doing a god job of avoiding an echo chamber and seeking alternate ideas.   
On the one side people can gather a key list of core devs and say "Look, Gavin is clearly wrong!" Others say he has earned a say because of his long time working on core, others point to him and say that he's not even the most key core contributor ... then we also can see a letter signed by 10 or so CEOs of the most massive, largest, important Bitcoin companies who say they support him....then others who will say that support doesn't matter because it's not science.   And so on.
I wouldn't even consider asking the board to remove Gavin unless there was a massive demand for such a thing from the members -- I suppose if someone really feels strongly enough about it they could create a "remove Gavin" campaign -- if we see many individuals and a few key corporate members asking for something then of course the board would vote on it.
But IMHO that's the last thing Bitcoin needs right now.  I see more people walling off others, becoming territorial, purposely excluding people or organizations such as ours -- etc.  Some people have gone out of their way to exclude the Bitcoin Foundation from things and not help us - yet they also complain that we get press coverage etc.
The best thing for Bitcoin right now is more collaboration, not more fighting.

Please please always be cautious of emails with wording like this.
Aside from the suspicious nature of it, the return address etc. the wording and style would NEVER fly with the compliance department of a decent sized company like Coinbase.
There would be a disclaimer, it would almost certainly not mention specific return numbers (let alone something as ridiculously high as 150%) it would be very unlikely to use all caps and it wouldn't say "astonishing opportunity" and have an exclamation mark.
Maybe it's different for people in finance who read lots of actual offers but this should set off red flags a mile away.  One glance should immediately make it obvious it's totally phony.   If not, work on reviewing and comparing some real announcements and be extra cautious.   If this one fooled you or could have fooled you then be especially careful in the future.

^^ Logic.  Roger isn't an auditor, never discussed BTC assets or verified that Bitcoin was there - never claimed anything that wasn't true...was not paid to make the statement.
Even if he had personally said he guaranteed that all Bitcoin was there (which he absolutely did not) it would not have been a guarantee for the future...such as months later when Gox collapsed.   People are actually holding Roger to both a higher standard than auditing firms while ALSO making fake statements about what he actually said.

Board seats are elected, Gavin was a board member but didn't run for re-election.
Chief Scientist is a separate title.  I don't think its dishonest just because his role changed.  He's now a volunteer, just like me - my title is Executive Director - Brock's title is Chairman of the Board - Marco Santori is Chair of Regulatory Affairs, Brian Klien was General Counsel etc... all volunteer positions.
If Gavin wasn't Chief Scientist who is?  I suppose we could make it an elected position or eliminate entirely - I just don't see the problem with it and don't know of anything he has done wrong other than get on the opposite side of tech debates with people.  If we had some other core Dev as Chief Scientist then the people who disagreed with him might feel the same way.    It also is a title that I think he earned by stepping up to do the work when Bitcoin was way more uncertain thing - Gavin was working on code and running Bitcoin faucets before most of us ever heard of Bitcoin.
Non profits need all the help we can get.  Anyone who wants to help is welcome to.  Any serious, credentialed core Dev who wants press coverage, speaking invites or a title or a committee to run is really welcome to come talk to me.  I just don't see a benefit of removing anyone from anything unless it's due to some major issue like fraud.  
To be fair, if you totally agreed with him, would you feel the same way?
You are a core Dev and we hung out at the London squat -- how about you join us?  I'll waive your member fee, if you are not already one, I'll give you blog author access rights, we can talk about you helping with DevCore workshop or a committee or whatever you'd like.

There is NO way to know when the "predictably highest" point is.
However it DOES make sense to diversify.
Lots of other factors play into this decision :  your risk tolerance, age, obligations, experience, other investments, income, time frame when you need this money, what it's for etc etc.
I'm guessing from your post that this is a decent amount of your net worth.  If so, yes you should sell and diversify -- Bitcoin is extremely risky and speculative.   Don't invest anything into Bitcoin you cannot afford to lose.

Like I said in the OP, yes it's true Bitcoin doesn't need a foundation.
The much bigger question is whether it can be a benefit or not.
One can make a solid argument that the annual meetings, DevCore and things like this are good for Bitcoin...same as we can argue that this forum, podcasts and other things are beneficial to Bitcoin overall even though they are not needed.
@_date: 2015-09-05 16:49:09
Fair enough.  I need to follow things like this with some consistency:  if I go and do something that does not have member consensus then I'd be rightfully heavily criticized.   
 
Even if I agreed with you on eliminating the role of Chief Scientist - my job is primarily to represent what the majority of members want - so far I don't know of any members who want that.   I'd be surprised if we could find 15-30 people who feel the same way --- even at 150 people that's only 10% of members.
Many people pushed for a more democratic process at Bitcoin Foundation, something that represented the broad community -- so we have a corporate board seat, an individual board seat, international and so on.  So the board is 100% elected by a large number of Bitcoin people.   All we can do is our best to represent what they ask for.
For a request like yours, which does not have much member or community support, all I can do it think about it, consider it and see if there is another way to accomplish something similar.  Could we change wording on the site in a way that would make you more comfortable or something along those lines?

Your post inspired me to write up a more detailed reply I can work on and use and post:
If you want to learn about Bitcoin, the digital currency, it's not too hard, here are some basics.
Don't worry about making it overly complex.  Some of the videos on the web are great...some go into lots of detail about the behind the scenes of how mining works etc.  --- stuff that very few people need to know.
Keep it simple.  
The basics are that Bitcoin is a new form of currency that is like the Internet or email for money.  Main difference is that the Bitcoin programming publishes everything owned by everyone on one giant ledger / list....called the blockchain while also keeping everyone's personal details private.
If I ask why couldn't I email you $1000 twenty years ago when email came about, what is the answer?   
How come I couldn't just send a note that said "Hey buddy, here is $1000"?    
The issue comes down to one of trust and verification.  You may not know me.  Even if you do know me, the note is useless for any transaction.  You couldn't forward the email to your car dealer and say "Here's $1000, don't worry I know Bruce is good for it".  No.  You and I would need a trusted third party -- such as a bank -- to say "Yes, Bruce really has this money, yes, he is really transferring control to you, yes it's really yours now and you really have it".   This, to this day is done by checks and wire transfers which are really just elaborate means of making accurate ledger entries in bank accounts to say who owns what.
Aside from a need for a trusted third party I also couldn't simply email you the $1000 because we'd have no way to ensure that this email wasn't copied or duplicated and sent multiple times.
Enter Bitcoin which solved the problems of needing a trusted third party and the problem of duplicating something....called a double spend.
The solution was made by publishing the list / ledger of what the values are publicly on something called the blockchain.   I picture it like a modern version of a giant ledger book in the center of the town square where everyone can see who owns what...while also keeping private.
It would be like if all the major banks shared the value of all of the accounts on a large, open source, public list that showed values but kept identities private.
Since this is public and spread across many computers, it can't be hacked or tampered with...
This all wasn't possible until someone discovered a way to combine an open distributed list like this with encryption -that is a major invention -- since Bitcoin is backed by encryption no one knows who's Bitcoin address corresponds to which person ...other than the person holding the private key, basically a super password that unlocks it....so it's totally private.  
It's also instant to transfer from one person to another using a computer or one of many apps online.  Basically an entry is made on this giant blockchain ledger that says XYZ address just sent 1 Bitcoin to ABC address which is then verified thousands of times by an independent network.  
Bitcoin can also be used to buy products and is accepted as a form of payment by individuals and thousands of businesses including major companies like Overstock, Dell, Microsoft and others.
Other key points worth knowing are that Bitcoin is issued to the world not by a central bank or government but my a computer protocol -- computers basically perform math based number crunching in what is called mining and have a proportionate chance of receiving Bitcoins based on how much computing power they use.   Cool thing is that these miners also serve to verify the transactions - which makes the network stronger and makes the ledger a very solid example of a statement of truth....indeed it's perhaps the world's most reliable and accurate ledger.
In the early days, anyone could start mining on a laptop and earn thousands of Bitcoin -- today we see huge industrial miners with warehouses full of specialized mining computers working on this.
The number of Bitcoin that will ever be issued is set in the hard code of the program at 21 million.  They are infinitely divisible -- so, unlike a currency where a central bank can simply issue new currency and devalue everyone else's, Bitcoin has a fixed cap....if the overall currency becomes as valuable as even a tiny country then each Bitcoin would be very valuable and we'd see people deal in fractions of coins...perhaps all the way down to the single Satoshi, named for the creator which is one millionth of a Bitcoin and worth a fraction of a penny today.
No person or group controls Bitcoin.  There is no CEO, no central authority.  It is controlled by the laws of math and programming.
It is an interesting invention and tech which has potential to change the world.
(note to techies:  this is an article for beginners, please excuse technical details or over simplifying) 
@_date: 2015-09-05 13:49:27
We've tried hard to invite others in, just like I just invited you.
We also have not used our massive membership base, name, press reach or anything else to take a side in the blocksize debate.  
Unfortunately people still are sometimes adversarial of the Bitcoin Foundation and treat us as if we are bias when we are working to be neutral. 
People also often criticise that we have the name Bitcoin in our name.  When this was chosen a huge community of people signed off on it.  If it's not us SOMEONE ELSE will take that role as a press contact, lightning rod etc.   I can pretty much guarantee that whoever filled the role if we didn't fill it would not have a fully elected board and the transparency we have.   
We have worked hard recently to make it clear that we don't represent Bitcoin as a whole and there is no central authority.
Best thing for people to do is help us change and improve as they'd like to see.

They only reason I'm presuming lack of support for the idea of removing the position of Chief Scientist is because -- until Peter Todd a moment ago, you were the only one who ever requested it.
We have 1500 members which include devs, a whose who of early adopters, miners, thinkers and nearly every major company involved in Bitcoin as well as many other smaller companies and we have chapters in 17 countries.   I don't know how you could say that this doesn't "remotely represent a cross section of the community" - it very closely is exactly representative of the community.  We also have a fully elected board.  What organization in Bitcoin is even close to having this wide a reach? 
As far as Chief Scientist -- I've got 100 things on my plate - things like DevCore San Fran only next month -- I think it would be a waste of time but if there was massive member demand then I'd bring the matter to the board to vote.

From my experience in this role so far, nothing would make the acrimony go away.  Some people just are negative and we are an easy target.
There have been many complaints about Bitcoin Foundation which were indeed fixed.  When I started as Executive Director the number one complaint was transparency, so we spent a ton of time revising board procedures, releasing financials and so on.   Before that some complained that we funded core, some complained when we stopped and so on.
Like I said, if not us then someone else would have the name, there's already a Bitcoin Alliance, Bitcoin Association etc.
If I thought it would help I'd be in favor of a name change. 
@_date: 2015-09-06 00:18:46
I'm a volunteer, we all are.  We are doing what we think we can do in the ways that we think can help Bitcoin.   In the past the Bitcoin Foundation funded some developers, organized some of the best conferences, worked with media, funded Bitcoin.org, funded Bitnodes project, crafted the largest most detailed reply to BitLicense and so on.   In the future we will work on lots of other things - such as the DevCore workshop on Oct 18.
I get the point of decentralization and if we could waive a wand and make it that way it would be great.  But in the real world press, speaker inquiries, replies to Bitlicense etc. are much more valuable if done from a known and yes, centralized, organization.  Have you seen a model that has worked otherwise?   Apache Foundation, Mozilla Foundation etc.   You don't need to trust us, the beauty of Bitcoin is that it doesn't need us and you don't need us either.

If not Bitcoin it would have to be some other alt coin with similar benefits..it wouldn't work on the old school rails.  Smart companies have a backup plan in case Bitcoin fails....but I don't think Circle is banking on this as a strategy.

Also - Blockchain confirms are what should be agreed on...this is different from agreeing it shows up in coinbase or anywhere else.
You send the coins, it shows on blockchain....X agreed on transactions using blockchain.info or whatever.   Whether it gets to coinbase or a broker in an hour or ever is not on you.
Coinbase is a large stable company....but what if this was some less stable company?  What if they were a scam? What if they had internal paperwork issues and never could see the coins? What if they lost the keys to control them?  Even if they are a legit company....what if the guy you send them to had his account blocked etc etc..

The pay and the title are two different things -volunteers can have titles (like me) -  he might have even had the title before he was paid.
When he took the MIT role he said and tweeted that he didn't intend to step down as Chief Scientist.
I'm glad he stayed and I'm happy to have him - the board is as well.
Some are concerned that he gets too much publicity from the role and his involevement -- they are welcome to join us as well.
Anyone who wants changes at Bitcoin Foundation can come help make those changes.

It's interesting you say "we still have no ETA" -- as if it's been a long time.
It was 48 hours or so.  To legally even add me to the bank account, get the signatures, have former employees contact accountants and lawyers, provide authorization for me to be named on accounts and review them etc. takes more time than 2-3 days.
I think it would have been more accurate to state that I've pledged transparency and then give me a realistic chance to actually deliver on that. 
@_date: 2015-04-15 19:24:34
I honestly don't know the status of this -- I'm still receiving transition documents and some items I may have to track the status of.
Something like this is IMHO a perfect area for the foundation to work on I like and support the idea.

Bad quality control if they don't at least exclude ridiculous ones -- someone claiming more than Gox ever had for example is obvious trolling.
Could also be an error with Yen / Dollar --- a number of people might have put their claims in JPY and the trustee took it as dollars.
Also -- they should say what the claims are in BTC - too messy to use dollars since the price has changed so much.

Remember-- physical security has been around for 3000 years longer than technical security -- a piece of paper with keys printed on it placed in a secure vault or safe deposit company (these companies are better than a bank) is much more secure than any technology in existence.
Also - with BIP 38 you can protect the key itself -- AND you can print more than one copy so that if one becomes lost, damaged or at risk you can use the other one....as far as I know this is the first time in history you can have your money control in more than one place at a time in this manner.

Thanks -- I'm very familiar with changetip, I'm even an investor as well as an active user.   I just wasnt clear that specifically you are suggesting 
@_date: 2019-09-22 12:04:13
Lots! 
I learned a lot more about computer science, the importance of security 
I think the most important thing I learned was about how open source distributed systems work.  It’s hard to grasp, especially if that's not your background.  But the fact that Bitcoin has no leaders is not just a marketing slogan, it’s actually true.  The code itself has all the rules and governance and that code is free for anyone to run or use.   
Pits amazing and powerful and can change our world.

Great idea, thanks -- we want to increase engagement as much as possible and it also might be sensible to have membership categories that consider the varied financial situation of members.  $1
@_date: 2015-04-06 14:27:37
1) get an old junk $100 laptop that will never go online again
2) load bitaddress.org and print 3 copies of 20 wallets - use BIP 38 to encrypt them with a password
3) put one copy in a safe, one in a safe deposit box and one in another secure location
4) have a backup plan that someone can get the password in case you are incapacitated, die or forget it
That's it - pretty secure for a pretty decent amount 
@_date: 2015-04-15 15:39:29

Cool, I love paper wallets.  
Counterfeiting and security of the paper is irrelevant as the Bitcoin public and private key could be printed on anything...either they are good or not.

I was one of the most very vocal opponents of the Bitlicense - (check out my Coincongress San Fran speech on YouTube if any doubt)
But the sad fact is, it's law now -- companies have three and only three choices:
 1) skip doing business in NY, 
2) violate the law or 
3) comply --  
A larger, serious company with serious backers does not have much choice -- they obviously cannot violate the law -- and it's not logical to skip a major market on moral grounds.
 They don't have the luxury of being idealists in the real world -- Circle had huge influence in reducing the most harmful components of Bitlicense --- I don't think anyone should fault them for getting the license.   The more success companies have and the more customers they have the better it is for everyone in the industry

@_date: 2015-09-09 11:43:03
This makes no sense.  Must be trolling, bad translation, joke, hoax, misunderstanding or incompetence.
For it to be 22 billion that's equal to 20,000 claims at $1 million each.   Or 10,000 claims averaging $1 million and the top three averaging $3.5 billion each.  
Based on this math the top three would have claimed more than 5x Gox ever had at the peak.
My best guess is either trolls messing with claims or a misunderstanding.
Edit: Fixed typo

What do you mean "were"?  Bitcoin Foundation is still supporting a study of risks.  It's not funding but led by a board member 
@_date: 2016-10-05 12:55:23
I don't have an issue with them stopping actual crimes of theft and fraud with actual victims, it's one of the few legitimate uses of govt -- the way I see this example is that it shows that we DONT need new regs to prevent a OneCoin type scam...they already are breaking a dozen existing laws.
Regulators are generally lazy - this is why the SEC ignored a 17 page tip about Maddof.  Crooks don't comply with their regsl. It's much easier to target honest businesses and burden them with paperwork etc.

True -- by nature as this tech is adopted some older models will be changed and destroyed -- this is political.
We were talking once and you said that the blockchain is simply a statement of truth and to be against it is against truth -- that's a good point and also political as well.
So there are two sides to the political part:  things which just happen by default because of the tech and the things we do proactively.

We don't misrepresent ourselves as the central organization behind Bitcoin.  Not sure what you are claiming the Bitcoin Foundation appropriates.
Why the focus on us versus the dozens of other groups who use Bitcoin in the name?
1500+ people very active in this community including many of the very earliest adopters and today also including leading companies, miners and more got together and supported this organization -- including its name.
I volunteered to do what I could to make the organization as beneficial to Bitcoin as possible.   In the few months I've been with the foundation I've put in countless hours, contributed capital and worked on many things -- I approved continued funding for Bitcoin.org despite the foundation's low capital, we funded bitnodes, planned DevCore, we published over 30 pages of educational material, we have a board member researching a paper on the threats, challenges and risks to Bitcoin (the last year's paper predicted this blocksize debate accurately) -- we worked with international chapters, attorneys etc.
Do you mind if I ask what you personally have done over the last few months to help Bitcoin?   [Edit, my bad, he's an active core dev...didn't recognize the user name, credit where credit is due. :) .]
We are here and it is what it is, I'm sorry you don't like the name but we are doing everything we can to help Bitcoin -- I wish you'd help us....if not, then I wish you'd start your own organization with your own choice of name and do better than us.

We at Bitcoin Foundation have been talking about this for some time.  The previous Executive Director had set up a Lighthouse server -- it was discussed in the elections for the board.
What we'd need for this to work is a very solid volunteer to run this committee -- someone who can manage the process from start to finish and get it working perfectly.
We can support it with members and reach.  It's a great idea.

Yes, big Bitcoin advocate and former financial advisor here--  Bitcoin could be transformational and could increase significantly -- but it is VERY risky and speculative -- you can lose every penny you put into it.   Please be cautious and only invest what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2015-04-15 17:28:32
I ask that question also -- there have been some things done which harmed Bitcoin such as having Karpele's involved and other things which helped Bitcoin such as working with core devs and hosting major events and DevCore.
I'd hope that those who are critics give us a chance to be a positive contributor to the community - I've been in the role only a couple days and we also have a fairly new and fully elected board.
There is no way for something called the "community" to vote for such a thing so it's a big hypothetical - in general I'd be against one group of people voting to tell another group of people who harmed no other that they cannot freely associate.  Everyone involved in the foundation has a desire to help Bitcoin and I'm confident the organization will do so.  If I thought it was harmful I'd be at the front of the line calling for an alternative.

Several mentions of the foundation in this thread.
BitPay has been a member of the Bitcoin Foundation.
Why not work together to make the existing organization as good as it can be?
We already have dozens of key industry members and thousands of individual members and contacts.
Massive failures occured in the past but it is a new team working on it and lessons have been learned.   Nearly every similar grouo in other tech areas had bumps in the road.
There were also some successes: funding of Bitcoin.org, the bitnodes project, funding of some core devs for several years, two of the best conferences in Bitcoin, lots of press coverage and speakers and most recently, DevCore a great one day development and tech focused event....next one in San Fran on Oct 18.
I didn't particularly like the foundation before I joined... But I volunteered to be Executive Director because I think it can serve Bitcoin and be an asset.
It's as much your foundation as it is mine.  Should we destroy what was built or make it work as an effective tool?   I think we can run with this -- we've had lots of great people step up to join, please consider helping.

For better or worse there are many organizations outside the space who look to the Bitcoin Foundation for questions and input, speakers etc.  This is an important role that will be served by some number of organizations no matter what the foundation does.
So I think our most valuable roles are in education and engagement.  I want to gather lots of feedback from forums like this as well and put these thoughts in a more organized format.

No, fraud is an actual thing.  If someone is lied to fraudulently then it's a very different thing than if someone chooses to do something stupid like gambling based on accurate info.
The definition of victim that it's legitimate for the state to enforce laws for is simple: people who have been physically harmed, had property destroyed or taken or who have been subject to fraud or a violated contract.  That's it.  Drugs, gambling etc don't fall into that category.

What did I do or other board members do specifically?
What can we do?   Are you entirely agains the idea of any organization at all?   Because that's simply not going to happen.  Without us there are still many other organizations.  
You mention something more participative yet are criticizing the one and only major group with a fully elected board and variety of individual members.  Ironically, this participation has directly led to some of the foundation's worst PR.   It's much easier to run a pure corporate group with a dozen members -- without the foundation this is all that would be left.

Because phone calls are ignored, there is no paper trail and a letter with multiple signers has more impact.
With a letter we have accountability so when this OneCoin collapses (it will) and when regulators call for new laws and regs to "prevent another OneCoin" (they will) we can show that it wasn't regs that was was problem but lack of enforcement of existing law.
It also shows an effort to self police those claiming to be in our industry.

How do you define crook?   I define is as someone who steals from someone else.  Do you have an actual person or people she stole from you can list and provide evidence of?   Not a gauge claim that she caused the financial meltdown ...as this could just as easily be blamed on many others....and doesn't necessarily meet the definition of crook even if true.

Having been there, on the stage and having conversations with Michael over dinner and during the event, I really dont think he was trying to point out Greg on this, even though he was looking at him.
Once this video was excerpted - even with me looking at it, it seems different than when taken in context of the whole event and the general feel.
This panel was not tense or awkward at all -- it had lots of laughs and was productive.  Andreas even tweeted a photo noting that in person its a lot more affable than things may seem online.
I dont have any personal special insight, but having met and spoken to several core devs I really dont think these folks dislike each other like many assume.
As organizer my  goal was to avoid a contentious / argumentative or unproductive event --  I worked really hard to get Matt and Greg to attend -  worked hard to have Gavin and Garzik fairly represented -  got advice from really serious people ahead of time and gave every speaker the choice of time and format.

Financial advisors are generally allowed to give advice about Bitcoin -- it also depends on firm policy and most firms have policies against it.
Yes, they are licensed typically as either a Registered Investment Advisor or a broker or both.
One other reason they don't recommend Bitcoin is simply that they can't be paid for doing so.
Recommending GBTC is much easier and including it in a portfolio would be easier both with firm policies and regulations.
The suitability and risk is present with any volatile asset - recommendations need to be appropriate for the investor's risk tolerance, assets, experience, timeline etc.

I give lots of speeches for people, including students.
One thing I always do that works well is ask say "download a wallet while I'm talking and once the first person is done I'll show you what I mean".  
 I reccomend using Blockchain (because it's easiest and the QR reader works most flawlessly) tell them they need to add a password and email.
Then keep talking (if you stop to wait for them to do the download and setup it will take 1-2 min so just keep talking).  Once done show them by giving them $1 worth of Bitcoin.
I then show the confirm, show Blockchain.info and explain how that transaction will be there forever on the blockchain and note that no technical or government force can reverse that simple transaction and it would have worked just as well for $1 million or if we didn't know each other.  
 Here's a few bucks to give away: $3

No of course not.  Bitcoin Foundation isn't a government or anything close to it.  It's a purely voluntary group of people with no coercive/ violent power.
If you support voluntary groups then what is the issue?  If your problem is with something specific that I am doing or the board is doing then let me know.....but it seems your beef really is just about the nature of centralized organizations themselves.
Will they all be replaced by some sort of DAO etc in the future?  Sure, to some degree....likely for a very long time, probably decades, there will still be organizations which are made up of people who voluntarily associate and pool resources to accomplish goals they agree on.   
I don't see any way to do something like this now -- we've tried to move toward crowdfunding -- we've cut central funding of things like Bitcoin.org, bitnodes and grants -- allowing these to be funded directly by the public (which actually ends up more centralized as the founders tend to be single corporations).
What else can be done by us at this stage?   Do you think we should not exist because a decentralized model which right now does not exist will take our place?   If so then why don't you build that model and get it going?  Our board member Olivier spent $100,000 on a decentralized project to replace the foundation -did you support that?
So decentralization is the wave of the future.  We get it.  If you have the impression of the Bitcoin Foundation being a bunch of old bankers holding our hands up to stop the world from moving forward then you have the wrong impression.   If you can show me a way to serve the members I represent and be decentralized then great.
Meanwhile, why bash us just for being an organization with the type of structure used by thousands of others?   Why not focus on criticism of much larger, more centralized, less transparent organizations:  the RNC, DNC whatever.   This is a tiny industry -- why not help our small organization try to do things that help Bitcoin rather than being against?

Thanks for the nice words :  one more thought -- UK violent crime is much higher than the US -- we of course have far more gun murders....but you have far more muggings, rapes and stabbings.   There is a trade off of sorts between the value on personal protection and the drawbacks that come with it.
I dislike the military industrial complex.  Firearm companies are tiny players in the overall government contracting world -- all the guns bought by the US and UK in the last decade are about the cost of one fighter plane order.
Personal firearm use decreases the power of the military industrial complex.
If you outlaw guns then you place a full monopoly of force in the hands of government.

Not sure of the purpose of bringing Bitcoin Foundation into an unrelated discussion just to be negative.
Bitcoin Foundation actually has done a lot for publicity, perhaps more than almost any other group and plans to do even more going forward.
Bitcoin Foundation hosted the first major Bitcoin meeting, hosted some of the largest, most successful events, hosted four DevCore events which were attended by over 1000 people, had an education committee create hundreds of pages of documents, was involved in the most comprehensive Bitlicence response, communicated with California on AB1326, has a speakers bureau who has arranged dozens of major speakers for organizations and has been in the media more than most organizations and has attended or hosted dozens of educational meetings.  
Much of this was done by unpaid volunteers  - its harder than it might seem.

I have a huge amount of respect for and many other members of the alliance.  
I don't want my criticism to be seen as being against them personally.   This isn't another Bitcoin debate.
I also think that the members want what's best for Bitcoin.
I also am completely 100% in favor of engaging with government.  I just have a different opinion on the most effective way to engage, and on this particular alliance.   
We are all shaped by our experiences, I might be more cautious of regulators because I've been regulated for so long.

Andreas got choked up and that, combined with the culmination of the day, got me choked up.  
This technology means a lot to me.  Working in this industry is a massive amount of work.  I've personally sacrificed huge amounts of earnings and untold time for Bitcoin -- when I look at an audience at an event like this I think "look at us...we are absolutely crazy....but I think we are good crazy, just like so many who came before us".   
I think we are part of something amazing.  I think that in 15 years a video like this will be watched and people will look at it like the old photo of Speilberg, Scorsese, Lucas, Howard and Coppola when they were in their 20s --- I think people will look back and say "wow, Maxwell and Gavin together with all these other folks....look how young they looked....look that they knew this was something"
Maybe we are all wrong...but it's a hell of a ride and even if I knew that Bitcoin was going to zero and the blockchain was a mirage...I wouldn't trade the experience or change a thing.
What got me choked up was looking at the devs and knowing the pressure they've been under, knowing that blocksize has been a contentious debate, knowing that a couple devs even dropped off the mailing list and that hard feelings have been had by others....but I also know and really believe that all these people mean well for this tech. 
 What I was trying to say was that, despite any developer disagreements.....they still...we still....have far, far more in common than 5.9999 billion people on earth.   Now let's do this.

Where are you from?
Guns partly protect us from violent citizens sure...stats on that are decent when compared to most other places, this is why I asked where you are from.
But, more importantly, guns serve as a counter balance to government which, historically has been FAR more dangerous than any civilian criminal.
In the last century you odds of being killed by your own government are probably 100 times that of being killed by a civilian bad guy.   This isn't conspiracy talk, its historical fact.

I just tested withdrawal.  It worked fine, no problem.  Took 30 seconds including the email verification it needed for confirming I was adding a withdrawal address.
I stared on BTCJam some months back, just to try a new Bitcoin tech.   I deposited one Bitcoin.   I made a number of small loans, only logged in a few times and reinvested some of the profits.
The 1 Bitcoin grew to 1.805 -- so a pretty stunning 80% return.   Just now I withdrew one coin and had no problems.
I think it's completely unfair to call them a "scam"
Some thoughts:
- my results might have been luck, market conditions in my favor or I might have had a better than average gut instinct on what loans to accept
- no one should depend on getting any return like I got, and they could lose some or all their money
- 80% as a return is typically an anomaly and isn't sustainable in almost all cases in any investment
- I would like to see a bit more done on verification and the feedback process for people asking for loans, yes it does seem fairly easy to get an A or B rating
- right now it doesn't have sufficient members to scale, it took a while just to invest one Bitcoin - once they grow this would be improved
Overall, I think it's a great site, good service and good idea.  They have made marked improvements on the user interface.
I'm not affilliated with BTCJam in any way.

You are basically the only continual perpetual troll on the CoinCenter issue.  Most people on Reddit disagree with you, most people on social media disagree with you.  IMHO most Bitcoin Foundation members overwhelmingly disagree with you.
I don't think the CoinCenter initiative is a good idea, neither does Andreas or Peter Todd or many other people.  This is not "hijacking" the foundation to support my friends (by the way, Roger was a founding member of the foundation and has provided more funding than anyone so it's odd to say that he should go start a new one because the ED happens to agree with him).   I have a difference of opinion than Coincenter on that one issue.  I disagree that speaking out against Blockchain Alliance is "damaging Bitcoin" - I think the alliance is damaging and I especially think that proactively asking regulators for more laws is damaging.  The EFF agrees.  Do you disagree with the EFF on the California Bitcoin bill?
You have attacked every post made on it yet haven't offered any constructive input or any compelling argument about why you think aligning with organizations like DHS/TSA and ICE a good idea.  Your only criticism has been that I "don't understand how things work" despite having 22 years of experience working with regulators and far more time as a business owner actually regulated by government financial industry regulators than anyone involved in the initiative.
You have a personal dislike of the philosophy of me, a massive number of people involved in Bitcoin, the EFF and therefor presumably Apple, Dropbox.  Perhaps you also supported Lawsky. I think you are on the wrong side of history, maybe I'm wrong but it's a waste of time to argue unless it's about discussing productive solutions.

If he puts in 10 minutes every 6 months....then that's 10 more minutes than 6 billion people.....and more than all but a very, very small number of people.
If he has one commit ever, for a spelling change on a notepad....then he has more commits than all but a very, very small number of people.
Let he who has made more commits and done more core dev work cast the first criticism.
By the way.... AFAIK no one is paying him for his core dev work or anything else...other than his own personal consulting and programming projects....so it's really not anyone's business what he's doing, other than the counter-signatory on whatever contracts he has.
On a personal note, I think he's a good guy....bit of a troll...but it's really his own personal joke with the world.  We should be thanking every single dev...and working really hard to get more people to be involved.

Saying Jerry creation of the group "does not mean he is supporting any type of regulation or any specify agency"  is factually incorrect and shows that you really don't know nearly as much as you think you do.
Jerry and CoinCenter specifically and actively asked for new Bitcoin regulation in California.  There is no way to know the facts of this and say that he "doesn't support any type of regulation" he absolutely does, it is a core mission, he has openly stated that he wishes this to be done in every state and has drafted roadmap  to that end -- this is very clear and not in dispute by anyone who followed the EFF's disagreement with his position.   
Apparently you are passionately arguing for him based on his speaking ability or something, without knowing even the most basic foundation of what Coincenter is actually doing.
I don't really care if you think Jerry is more of an expert or more knowledgeable than I am.  I'm not in a contest with Jerry -- we simply have a difference of opinion just as the EFF disagrees with him.   There are plenty of people who think that me actually being regulated for 23 years and doing billions of dollars in complex transactions is relevant.   I don't doubt Jerry's expertise and clearly Jason Wienstien is an extremely knowledgeable expert on law - I just have a difference of opinion on the best methods.
Your continual ad hominem attacks and name calling doesn't make you correct, no matter how badly you wish it did.   I agree with the EFF and I agree with the privacy policies of companies like Apple and Dropbox - politically I agree with Congressmembers Thomas Massie, Justin Amash or former Governor Gary Johnson.   To continually attack everything I say as "wing nut" simply because you disagree and yo attempt to discount my experience just because you disagree with my conclusions is childish.
I also didn't say that every miner and CEO agreed I was responding to your comment that outside these circles people agree....these circles include essentially everyone in our industry.

Yes, he is evil and manipulative and violent.
He has voted for the debt ceiling increase every single time it came up, he voted to fund the wars even though he said he didn't support them, he supported military action in Kosovo and when peaceful protestors showed up at his office he has them arrested, he believes it is legitimate to use violence against peaceful people to take thier property, he thinks Uber should be regulated etc.
He also is not at all consistent in his stances....in 1976 his platform was to "reduce taxes" when he wanted to appeal to Vermont voters he was pro gun, when he needs to win a democratic primary he is anti gun.
He will do or say anything to get elected and accumulate more power under the large, authoritarian government he wishes to rule.
His campaign is embarrassingly manipulative with no substance and consists entirely of shouting about problems, telling people what they want to hear and blaming a small class of people (the 1%).  He actually posts memes on his website with themes along the lines of "this is how cheap cars used to be, look at the cost now" or "X % of people can't afford their next meal" -- it's total, utter BS designed to pull at emotions, there is no substance and no backing or even the most simple explanations of where he'd get all the free stuff to give away.

So many false statements.   I am not using the foundation to put forth a political agenda anymore than the supporters of the Blockchain Alliance who are foundation members are doing so.   You just don't agree with my opinion.  If I would have said "Congratulations, great work to partner with DHS" you would have had no issue with it.  
I don't go out of my way to promote Roger, I tweet and mention many people in Bitcoin.  No, I never said anything close to saying if someone disagrees with Roger that they support killing children....talk about a stretch....you are honestly arguing about my hypothetical opinion on the opinions that other people have about a different person.
I get it, you think CoinCenters method is the best one.  What is so hard for you to understand about someone disagreeing with you?   When did I claim that "every interaction is helping the violent ones"?   You keep making completely bizarre statements like this.    I really don't follow the end of your post -- no, I don't support the DHS or ICE and I'd be perfectly happy without them.

Volunteer Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation here.
The foundation had many problems, no doubt.
I'd ask people to judge based on what it's doing now.
The foundation also did many good things: funding several core devs, engaging with media, funding Bitcoin.org, funding bitnodes, hosting some of the most successful conferences etc.
Just a few weeks ago we hosted DevCore and launched a speakers bureau network.
Every board member is a volunteer and I am also a volunteer.  The budget is very lean now.
I chose to try to help and be productive rather than complain from the sidelines.   I think that the foundation does and can continue to benefit Bitcoin overall.
It might be most fair to complain about things that I am actually doing or things done by the actual management and current board rather than things that occurred years ago under different leadership.
It's terrible that Karpeles was originally involved, he's a profound embarrassment to all of Bitcoin.   But I had no part of that decision and no one involved with that at the time is still with the foundation. (Other than Gavin who didn't select Karpeles and has no fault or involvement in Gox)  In fairness to the people who were involved, Karpeles was a board member at a time long before people were aware of the problems at Mt. Gox when he was widely considered to be a top leader in Bitcoin.   
If the suggestion is to simply close the foundation because of problems that occured years ago, I don't see how that is productive.

 unjustifiably claiming or being credited with accomplishments or qualities.
OneCoin is committing fraud -- I'm not a victim therefor I'm not making a criminal complaint or suing them directly because I have no grounds.

Are you offering to volunteer?  Because if so we have plenty of things to do.  
I spend at least 20 hours a week that I could be earning a living or with my family or at the gym on foundation work.  If you want to help, great...we'd love to have your help.   If you don't want to volunteer and just want to complain that the many, many thankless hours I donate to this in exchange for tons of critisism isn't enough and I should do even more, then I'm sorry, there are only so many hours in the day.  
 I get requests every single day for things that are "really simple", "will only take an hour or two" or "would be really easy to get the members to fund" - reality is that these things take more time than you might realize.  Even something as simple as drafting a letter takes at least an hour, often quite a bit more - someone also has to send it, reply, it should be discussed internally before sending etc.  Then, what's the next step?  If the members respond favorably then we still need to do something with that -- now you are talking 10, 20, 30 hours, getting people together, figuring out roles, the best course of action etc etc.  
 I'm more than happy to volunteer even more of my time to help shepherd something, guide and work with members and use the foundation name and resources -- but I'm sorry, it's just not possible unless someone steps up as the champion who wants to lead it.   I'm not trying to dodge or not put in work.  I'm just being honest.

Every week or so there is a post of someone angry at Coinbase or Circle for something similar.  They are simply doing what they feel they need to do to stay out of legal trouble.
The anger really should be directed to people like Ben Lawsky, politicians and people and organizations who, right now, in our own industry are actually proactively ASKING for MORE regulation.
Regulations are no joke.  It's easy from the sidelines to talk about fighting the system and making a new breed of company.  The cold reality is that the regulators can completely and utterly destroy any company in Bitcoin if they feel like it.  
If they really want to, state actors could likely put anyone in this industry in jail.  There is a book titled "Three Felonies a Day" that estimates that the average American commits three felonies daily.  Charlie Shrem is currently in jail for failure to file a form that deemed that a customer was suspicious -- Charlie sold bitcoins to that customer ...who in turn sold it to other people...who used it on Silk Road, most likely for drugs.  His crime was not filing a form that reported this as suspicious.  Meanwhile, HSBC had a special teller window installed at a branch near the Mexican border so that cartel members could fit large suitcases of cash through to deposit over $300 million.  Yet no one from HSBC went to jail.   Charlie was targeted simply because he is in this industry and was well known.  Despite him meeting with Lawsky nearly once a week, having lawyers and proactively working to comply, he was made an example of.
Fortunately today's Bitcoin CEOs face less chance of jail time but they still face the harsh reality that the State can destroy thier business.  I'm sure some companies wish the regs were less but they feel a responsibility to employees, customers and shareholders to avoid problems.

The board and I are volunteers.  There are two part time paid staff members: a part time bookkeeper and an almost full time operations director.   These two staff members are doing the work which was previously done by over a dozen paid staff.  The current overall budget is about $100,000 per year, down from many many times that at the peak.
This includes costs for web hosting, various ops, legal etc.  We have provided many grants in the past - we were a sponsor of Scaling Bitcoin etc.   I cut the previous budget by something like 90%+ - I don't see any way to cut it further unless someone wants to volunteer to be a bookkeeper or operations manager.
Corporate sponsors for events require work.  Unlike almost all other events, events like DevCore are not for profit.  The ticket cost was very low (only $25 for students / $150 for non students) - I simply don't have the time to pursue tons of corporate sponsors for events like DevCore - we posted a position to help on this recently and to get sponsors we rely on efforts of mine and board members.
The DevCore events typically lose money for example -- this is the difference between a non-profit and for-profit group -- the primary goal is not to turn a profit, but to provide something that is useful to Bitcoin.

I think you are looking at it from a techie standpoint.
I've used Armory - don't make a competing wallet, have no VC interest and I do secure bitcoins....no offense, but it's clunky as hell -- it's not even close to the level of usability needed for something that can ever attract a tiny percentage of the market.   
The security side of the programming is great ....the user interface is terrible.  This is a common problems -- developers think that because they are overall computer programming geniuses that they know something about user interface when they don't....it's rare to have both skills --- Sean Neville from Circle is a great example he has high level tech skills AND is a master of user design.  I know it's a different type of product but take a look at the difference in usability....literally anyone who knows how to use a phone can use Circle in minutes.....for Armory you need to be a hard core geek with 30 minutes to burn.    This is another common problem in development:  techies being so smart that they forget the skills/ attention span of their target market -- sure Armory is easy for the kind of folks hanging out on GitHub .....but most general users are no where near the skill / interest level needed.   The average computer user has no clue about how to do something as simple as back up a SQL file or change a DNS entry on a website.
The evidence has already spoken: Armory is losing market share daily when they had a golden opportunity originally.

Well they have lodge meetings, the original meetup....which have been going on every week worldwide for hundreds of years.
Probably slightly less aware of Bitcoin on average than the average person...maybe the same.   Demographics include a lot of older folks so statistically they adopt new tech less.   But surely if you went to a San Jose lodge you'd likely have a few VCs and maybe some Bitcoin folks.

I can't bring myself to be happy that a politician who was not elected and who should have very little regulatory control making a statement that vaguely alludes to her being open to the idea of not arresting peaceful people for the use of new technology.
Why is her opinion being proactively sought out?  The Fed has very, very little regulatory authority.  What does the House care what she thinks on this?  Her role is to inflate fiat and give perks to bankers.
I'd also note that the statement :
"We are thrilled to see that House members are taking an active interest in digital currency technology"
in my opinion, does not reflect the opinion of most people in this industry by any long shot.  
Thrilled?  Personally I'd prefer it if no House member or any other policitican took any interest at all in Bitcoin and left us all alone to innovate, create jobs and make new technology.

What "agenda" are you talking about?  
This entire crusade you are obsessed with seems to be because I made a handful of comments two weeks ago saying that I think an alliance with organizations like the DHS/TSA, ICE etc to "catch bad guys" is a very bad idea.  This is not even a foundation initiative, just me commenting, other prominent members of the foundation have different opinions.  In every public comment I said that I respect the members and opinions.   
Preston Byrne's piece is a long, barely readable drone full of logical fallacies. Kuhlman's is the same, very old, tired arguments boiling down to "if you don't like it move to Somalia" (ignoring things like the fact that Somalia's fall was preceded by a socialist government).  
Kuhlman also uses the argument you seem fond of to "stop acting like children".   This, you see, along with things like name calling, is the sign of someone who has no real logical argument.  Since you and Kuhlman don't want to argue on logic you resort to ad hominems and dismissing all opinions other than your own as "childish", "wing nut" and painting them as if we are in some extreme bubble of delusion.   The video Kuhlman highlights includes Jefrey Tucker, Max Keiser, Peter Todd, Gavin Wood, Patrick Byrne who runs a billion dollar company and many others--  it's just not credible to dismiss opinions held by many people as "childish" and to assume that every one of us is against mainstream engagement.
I know it's convenient for your world view to dismiss me as some sort of fringe extremist who won't engage with policy makers and who can't work with mainstream people.  You really should look into things a bit more and ask around about my background and the level of people I've dealt with for years.
Judge me on what I've actually don't and said.  If you think an alliance to help catch those that ICE and DHS think are the bad guys is a great idea then we can agree to disagree.

Hi Luke,
We hope soon!  :)  The audience was a technical audience, but newbies to Bitcoin core dev...basically people who want to be devs.
For speakers....We did have three of the top ten in terms of commits: Gavin, Maxwell and Corallo.
The other four faculty: Charlie Lee, Jeff Garzik, Andreas and Michael Perklin also added value - Charlie spoke about alt coin dev, Garzik is knowledgeable, Perklin runs a certification / best practices program and Andreas is an excellent communicator and consistently popular speaker.   
The most useless one on the stage was me....but I mainly just introduced people and organized.
I did tell a joke though:  Q:  What are the 10 types of people who attended DevCore?
A:  Those who understand binary and those who don't.
We'd love to have even more devs -- and ideally, the goal is to encourage more people to become devs.
If you have ideas I'd love to hear them.  One thing you might be perfect at helping with is a communications effort we are launching with two goals 1) fairly static developer training &amp; info. 2) a regular update about what is going on in core dev, what's important and what is being discussed ....presented in a simple, easy summary that is understandable by non-dev Bitcoin folks, VCs, CEOs, foundation members etc.

Milly, give it a rest -- the perpetual trolling on the CoinCenter issue is ridiculous.
Roger and I had similar personal political opinions since before Bitcoin even existed...go back and look at internet posts from years ago.
Roger isn't on the board and provides no direction or oversight at all.  
I have a philosophical difference of opinion with CoinCenter -- I think that opinion represents Bitcoin well and especially represents the foundation membership well.   If you disagree then provide evidence:  go do a poll-  come here on Reddit or solicit opinions of the 1000+ foundation members showing that most support asking for new regulations and alliances with organizations like the DHS.
Membership support for my comments are at a 100 to 1 positive ratio.
You've made your point: you love asking for new regulation, you disagree with the EFF and you think that repeating things like the Lawsky debacle are a great idea and you are thrilled that CoinCenter has partnered with the DHS/TSA and the Immigration service....great...we get it.....you've mentioned it 20 times.   I disagree.   No need to make up conspiracy theories to support your bad ideas.   
I might be wrong.  I predicted the Lawsky disaster exactly as it occured a year beforehand.  Time will tell whether I, Andreas, Peter Todd, Erik V and the hundreds of people who supported my comments are right or wrong.

No one should underestimate Masters, she has as much brain power as anyone in this industry.  It's also early to judge her tech and business.  
Worst case scenario: her plan is not ideal.  So what?  It's still great to have more investment and work in the industry.  Even if so, she can likely pivot the business model if needed later.

It doesn't mean that 1) she can't pivot or 2) even despite this can't built a billion dollar company.  AOL was worth billions at one point.

I'm "naive as to how government's and regulators work"?
I have 22 years as a regulated and licensed investment professional, 18 years as a FINRA compliance supervisor / General Securities Principal, and over a decade as an SEC registered investment advisor.  I was licensed for almost two decades with the Series 7, Series 66, Series 3, Series 24, Series 33 exams and the Uniform Investment Advisors Law Exam.  I've been governed by regs from state regulators, SEC, NASD/ FINRA, NYSE, DOL, IRS, PWBA and others.
 I've been licensed with all 50 states in the US and done over $5 billion in transactions in over 15 global markets.  I've been regulated by a dozen regulators on three continents, met dozens and dozens of regulators, served as an expert witness and met 10 heads of state.   I owned a 25 year old US government tech/ security contractor with clients including the DOJ, DOD, FBI, DHS, White House and every service branch.
I surely don't know all I could but I'm working on it, give me some time.   In the meantime, let me know your personal experience with regulators and government so I'm not so naive.
PS: is Tim Cook, Elon Musk and Dropbox council also naive?

We support our members and stand by our members.  
Overwhelmingly, the majority of members seem to agree that partnering with US enforcement agencies with mixed track records of public service is an endeavor frought with great risk and little to no possible reward.
Since enforcement agencies have no say in what laws are made or how or even how they are enforced, they have no power whatsoever to reduce regulatory burdens in our industry.  They also have little to no PR influence and, even in the extremely unlikely event that they were so enamored by CoinCenter that they decided to engage in PR for Bitcoin, it would be unlikely to be approved by others in the agency, and even if it did would be ineffective as these agencies themselves have terrible reputations among the general public, with DHS/TSA and ICE being likely second only to the IRS in terms of bad reputation and the FBI being known for scandal and bureaucracy.
For those several prominent individual and corporate members who do support such alliances, we stand by you as well.  Sometimes the best thing a friend can do is point out when someone is making a mistake.

Well, if this makes sense I never outwardly expressed it in Bitcoin because it's totally unrelated.  Same reason I don't talk about my religion or sexual orientation or any number of other topics.   I AM open about those things and HAVE been public about being a freemason, it's listed on various bios, I made this video and others in 2013 and posted them on YouTube etc.  
I post my name as admin of the Facebook freemasons page and have posted about it many times on social media, it's on my LinkedIn page.    I don't know what more I could have done other than intro a Bitcoin speech by saying "I'm Bruce Fenton, freemason".  It just wouldn't make any sense at all to bring up in a Bitcoin setting because it is totally unrelated.  I also didn't think it was much a concern as I thought most people would dismiss conspiracy theories.
With libertarianism and politics I mention those more in Bitcoin circles because they are related and having people discuss the role of government and nature of force goes in line with regulation and monetary policy.

Their estimate is 10% of GDP will be in Bitcoin by 2027.  Using today's value of global GDP which they list as $80 trillion that comes to $380k per Bitcoin.  ($8t/21m)
This assumes no GDP growth at all, if GDP grows at 3% then we'd have global GDP of $114 trillion by 2027 and 10 in Bitcoin would equate to $580k / coin.
The data used by the WE Forum is off, they say Bitcoin is valued at $20 billion, so it might have been the peak but isn't true today.
They don't give any real data on how they got this number, so it's not as solid as it could be.
The estimate seems extremely ambitious, 10% is a massive number bordering on ridiculous.

This is a very big deal.  Right now there is no vehicle for brokers/ financial advisors, family offices, 401k participants etc to buy Bitcoin in an easy way on a platform they use.
For a couple years I've thiught that a public vehicle like this would be a major catalyst for adoption as well as price increase.  The potential is massive.
If this fund even raises a small amount then the price impact could be significant.

This is a personal not Bitcoin Foundation effort
But I think it goes hand in hand and isn't a conflict (I wrote the  Bitcoin Foundation mission you reference) -- this is a technical, or, more specifically, non regulatory solution to a problem.
You'll never ever see me asking for new laws to stop something like OneCoin -- this only asks that existing enforcement be directed toward existing theft 
My conversations with regulators are:
1- we don't need new laws
2- theft and fraud are already illegal
Enforcement: If you are genuinely concerned about consumers, stop crimes like OneCoin
That's why it also says "enforcement agencies" not lawmakers or regulators (though many regulators are also enforcers) 
Does this make sense?

Main difference is ease of purchase.  Today virtually all brokers, financial advisors, hedge funds, family offices, 401k plans and pensions (and 99.99% of IRAs) use the same type of standard custody platform for all assets.
Right now those platforms cannot hold Bitcoin.  If you want to buy Bitcoin in an account at Charles Schwab, Fidelity, Merrill Lynch or your 401k account you can not.
With this being listed -- as soon as it's listed -- almost every single one of those above will be able to instantly and easily buy this vehicle in regular brokerage accounts.  This means millions of customers and hundreds of thousands of brokers / financial advisors/ registered investment advisors will be able to buy this vehicle with Bitcoin exposure as simply as saying "sell AAPL buy BIT".
It's a very big deal with massive implications for the space and price.

Not a competition but not accurately "a lot" more big players... Just about every one of them is a also a foundation member --- in addition we have another 70+ corporate members, 17 global chapters and 1500+ individuals.
It's not a competition -- we have no interest in such a partnership with Federal agencies and it's not our focus anyway.

Okay, but your philosophy alone will not prevent the existence of other groups - nor should it as anyone should be able to freely associate how they wish.
By arguing that Bitcoin Foundation shouldn't exist you are arguing that the 1500 members should not have the right or ability to freely associate.  Even if we did not exist, there would still be many other groups in this industry.  Many of these are great groups....but none are as broad or representative as the foundation.

I'm really curious if you have a second: do you think having other tokens use the Bitcoin network or projects like RSK to bring Solidity &amp; Ethereum like 2nd layer projects to the Bitcoin chain are a good idea?
I have an idea for a token: I like the ERC20 platform &amp; concept but think the Bitcoin chain is superior to the Ethereum chain so would rather issue using that.
Is this the right kind of thinking?  If you wanted to issue a token would you make a new chain or use Bitcoin's?

This email was a private/ non public email meant for about a dozen of the leading core Devs.
Some have asked why I'd reach out to Devs via private email rather than a public blog post --  IMHO the chances for conflict and drama are increased when people play to a public audience.   
We've worked hard to reach out to all sides in the recent technical debates to build bridges and increase understanding.
The purpose of this email was to solicit input / advice from core Devs and to let them know that the Bitcoin Foundation feels we represent all of Bitcoin including all of Core and that we would welcome help and input.
There is no expose or secret info in this private email other than that, like virtually all emails that everyone sends, there is a different style in communications that people think are private or public.  
For example - I would not have publicly published so much info about the research grant because it is not finalized and I would not have named specific board candidates.  I also would not have had the terms of the research worded in a way that might seem negative to core -- it's different to offer an opinion privately than publicly especially if it can be construed as critical.
I think that private emails remaining private is a better practice and I would always respect any email sent to me as private.   
There is no advantage of posting this on Reddit, in fact it makes cooperation far less likely as core supporters are responding less and those against core use this email as an argument that core is corrupt etc. 
NOTE:  One thing I've noticed was misunderstood in this email was where I said the role of Executive Director previously paid over $100,000 and I do this now for free.   Some people misunderstood this as me saying that I was paid the salary previously... no, the role had the salary for the previous Executive Directors -- I never had any salary from the foundation and do not now.
Happy to address the foundation / any thoughts anyone has - here are a few major points that are most commonly brought up:
- Bitcoin doesn't need a foundation - yes, this is of course true - we think that we can help Bitcoin overall and be an asset to Bitcoin - whether the foundation existed or not there are going to be industry groups 
- the Bitcoin Foundation did ____ in the past -- yes, the foundation made many mistakes from its founding and onward - I'd ask people to judge based on the current acts of the people actually involved now
- Bitcoin Foundation wasted millions - Yep, again this has nothing to do with the current team -- the current budget is less than 6% of the peak and consists of two part time employees and basic expenses like web hosting and ops I stand by every expenditure made while I've been a volunteer 
- you should become a DAO / hold more elections/ change the org structure/ video tape board meetings / have a token for all members to vote etc etc -- it is challenging enough to work on projects in the volatile and ever-changing space -- even more so when working on a turnaround of an organization --  I appreciate the ideas and benefits of things like DAOs but what we really need is to be more effective -- there isn't any evidence that experimenting with unproven org structures makes anything work better -- in fact, having an open and broad election process and transcript format notes might have been ineffective rather than helped us help Bitcoin
- the foundation at one point was almost the only industry group - it perhaps attempted to do too much and be all things to all people -- at this stage the organization is smaller and leaner and really has just a few simple goals like running DevCore events - if you support those goals, great, if not, that's fine also 
- don't attempt to control Bitcoin -- clearly this isn't the intent - the goals of the foundation are to host a few events/encourage new developers, provide education to key influencers and the public and support research - nothing to do with controlling Bitcoin 
- tell the board to remove Gavin from his honorary position he is terrible / stop supporting core or trying to work with them, they are terrible and caused all the problems /  you are a shill for CEOs / you are a shill for individuals etc etc.  - as a large organization with broad membership it's a challenge to try to represent all members by nature we have members who are on very different sides of the issues we as an industry face -- if we were a more "old boy's network" with a dozen sponsors and no individual members then it would be easier to find common ground 
- shut it down - 1) We have members, donors and stakeholders who want it to continue - right now the majority of the board feels it makes sense to do so 2) what would be the reason -- so far the most compelling reasons for calls to shut down are based on very old acts, in some cases 2-3 iterations of management ago -- some decisions that people are unhappy with were literally made by people that current management had never met --    The logical question is whether an organizational structure and name can be separated from what it is actually doing and the people actually involved - we will have to see 
Thanks

We can compare it to anything that's easy these days, Wordpress, whatever.
Just because it's complex and does stuff others don't do, doesn't mean it can't be easy also.  Wordpress is trivially simple but has a mess of complex stuff behind the scenes with the database tables.
Armory could do really simple things with the UI to improve it -- when you first select the program it has the test version, offline etc...this isn't clear...there should be just one simple one-option.
Next thing is you come to a clunky looking screen...suppose you click "send" or receive Bitcoin -- it then tells you to "download Bitcoin" --- "Wait a minute" says a new user, "what do you mean 'download Bitcoin'?" -- it's not clear if this is downloading keys or whatever....so then they figure out the next step which is to hit the download button....oops, doesn't work, some message about security....so then they follow the message to launch some other site called Bitcoin.org (wtf is this they are thinking)  and "download Bitcoin" -- this isn't making much sense to them....they finally get to Bitcoin.org and don't see a download option for "Bitcoin core" -- okay, they wonder:  is this the same thing as "download Bitcoin"?   Okay, DL 20gb to find out etc etc ....it goes on.
Very, very few things need to be this complex these days....my 8 year old can render 3D templates on Blender.   I think Armory made a conscious decision to just not focus on ease of use....that's fine if you want the same tiny number of early adopters -- it just makes me sad because with a small amount of effort they could be doing way, way better.

How am I misrepresenting Jerry?  Are you not aware that he wanted more regulation in California and that the EFF disagreed and I made comments supporting EFF?   Are you not aware that they have made a partnership with the DHS/TSA, ICE etc?
You've said 6-7 times that I "don't understand" how things work.  You are simply wrong.   Disagree with my opinion all you want but I have 20+ years dealing with regulators and being regulated in multiple jurisdictions including the US.  I've been a registered supervisor, passed numerous exams and done billions of dollars in transactions.  Is there any other person in the Blockchain Alliance who has been governed by regulators in this way?
Does the EFF also not understand how things work?   You think I'm so involved in a small group that I don't understand what other major business people are talking about?   Do you even know the first thing about my career and the type of people I meet with regularly?  Don't embarrass yourself.
What technical information are you referring to?
So everyone agrees with you if they are "not involved" with Reddit OR the Foundation or BitcoinTalk?

I know all of this that you are saying....I wasn't comparing the services and clearly Armory holds WAY more coins than Circle, maybe even more than Coinbase.   
I'm really familiar and active in this space so you don't need to sell me on decentralization of control of you our coins - I used Armory when there was no other option.   You are getting hooked on the comparison of the services, I'm well aware it's a different tactic and market between you and someone like Circle.   Compare it to Wordpress for another example -- I'm not talking about features...just purely UI.
I was only comparing the UI.  I think the attitude that "it has to have this level of complexity to run a full stack" isn't accurate.  I gave a few examples above of how it could be way easier and more intuitive -- simple things like clarity in text, navigation, menu buttons, explanatory tool tips etc. -- they have nothing to do with what's under the hood.  This is the problem IMHO for Armory I've seen and heard similar comments from others at Armory....you seem to totally dismiss UI -- its almost a badge of honor for you that it's hard :)  -- and not even make an effort but shrug that it has to be this hard....it doesn't.  
I don't gain anything by telling you this...I know your product is superior - but I really believe the UI and ease of use could be radically improved.  This is more important than ever for your market as more Wall St folks and companies end up with more coins but without the tech savvy of many early adopters.

When Jerry says "we are going to help catch the bad guys" and his new partners view gay website owners as the "bad guys" then it's a perfectly reasonable question to ask who Jerry meant.
If you think a good use of time for leading companies is to help the DHS track Bitcoin purchases of suspected sex workers then that is your right....I just disagree.   If you don't think this is a good idea...and I suspect almost no one does....then I'd suggest we not work with these people.

Second Market is not the same as Digital Currency Group -- Barry had his original business Second Market....did Bitcoin work...moved all Bitcoin over to DCG -- spun of and now sold Second Market.
This is good in the sense that presumably it helps Barry and indirectly DCG -- but, in and of itself, as far as I understand, does not have much direct relevance for Nasdaq and its Bitcoin activities.
For that look to DCG who is doing great things all the time focused on Bitcoin.

Not sure what is at all 'ridiculous' about this tweet.
All organizations engage in fundraising - if a tiny fraction of out members took 1% of what they saw in an increase in BTC value from this week and donated then the foundation would be able to operate for a year or two with no new fundraising drives.

Not indirectly either.
Since I became ED, Roger has given me exactly zero instruction, suggestion or attempt to influence anything the foundation has done.

Something going up 20% over a short time does not mean it's a good investment or a wise part of overall asset allocation.
Bitcoin should only be a small portion of an overall portfolio.
Having said that, remember that financial advisors typically don't make any money on the assets they don't control....so they have a financial incentive to get you to sell Bitcoin and buy mutual funds, managed accounts or whatever crap they are selling.

You have an incredible knack for talking with authority as if you knew what you are talking about when you really have no idea.   
You also moved the golposts on this, first you said that Jerry doesn't ask for regulation, then you presumably Googled it and now are making excuses for why his proposal makes sense.
Yes, EFF agrees on the problems as do I - I'm completely in line with the EFF on this and I think they are correct -- you keep resorting to name calling the positions on this as "Wing nut" simply because you disagree.  
I warned about Lawsky and some people thought I was incorrect....if I looked back it would not surprise me if you called me names then as well.  Fact is, my predictions turned out to be exactly correct.  Where were those calling for regulation in Califorina back then?  Wrong as well?  The people who were dead wrong about Lawsky are generally the same on who still disagree with me now.
You are also completely incorrect in how you characterize both my opinions and actions.  I absolutely believe regulators and lawmakers should be engaged with, I've engaged with them many, many times.  In my career I've worked on projects all the way to international head of state / cabinet minister levels.   You seem to have this picture of me out railing against "statists" with no open dialogue when it's completely incorrect.   I would guess that I've met and worked with far more venture capitalists than you have -- I'm well aware of what their concerns and opinions are both on and off the record.   I don't know that you think the "wing nut position of the foundation" is, also, no idea what your rambling about me levying a billion dollar lawsuit is.   It's completely inaccurate to paint the disagreements in technique as an argument of libertarianism versus legitimacy - it's simply a different opinion, one that I'm on the same side on as the EFF who has far more experience on this than any group in this industry.

If it's large amount, long term -- IMHO you can't go wrong with good old paper wallets.
Here's the deets:
1) get an old piece of junk laptop / PC you don't need any more or even buy one for $200 (if on a budget you can use Ubuntu, tails etc instead of a dedicated PC) -- either a dedicated computer or use of Ubuntu / other special OS will protect you --- 
2) go to Bitcoinpaperwallet.org or bitaddress -- save the page to your desktop -- go offline and never go online with that computer again
3) print a mess of paper wallets -- three copies of each -- use BIP 38 which makes it so you can protect them with a password--   Use a dumb printer -- older, basic model- not wifi printer
4) you can use tear proof paper, fire proof sleeves and other means of protecting these wallets if you want, plain paper is also fine -- take a sharpie and number the wallets with a name:  TIGER 1, TIGER 2 whatever --- this way you can easily match the same wallet copies to each other -- you can use cool tape and sleeves for them
5) keep one copy in a safe deposit company (or bank safe deposit box....a dedicated safe deposit company is a bit more secure than a bank when it comes to seizure or court orders)    -- keep one copy in a safe -- keep one copy somewhere else -- if you want to get crazy you can put them in different countries or use vaults in the EU -- you can also print a PDF from the laptop and save it on a USB etc.
6) make sure the BIP password is backed up somewhere, somehow in the case of your death, injury, incapacitation etc.  - you could have it with a lawyer, loved one etc. or use some code like a Dan Brown novel -- just back it up somehow -- all the worse events: extreme trauma, a 9-11 scale event if your town, war, head injury, tragedy etc...when you'd need the coins most are also the type indecent that can cause memory loss -- never, ever depend on you remembering any password -- keeping it with a trusted person is pretty safe -- especially if they don't have access to the safe -- you only need to trust them enough to not rob your safe :)
You now have a basically unhackable, unseizable store for your Bitcoin -- if one location was robbed, all you'd need to do is get one of the other copies and move the coins before the thief could brute force the BIP38 -- very, very safe and super easy 
I put in some extra steps for extra security.
TLRD:  get a safe PC not online, print duplicate copies of paper wallets, protect them with a password

@_date: 2015-10-10 12:42:11
I think the transparency issue was mainly a buzzword that was just picked up as a good talking point for people to complain about.
When I came aboard it was listed by many as a concern so I immediately worked to be more transparent.   On the first or second day or so I tweeted our finances and I also provided an update in a letter.
Since then, we release financial information, have a fully elected board, release board minutes.
We are now, by far the most transparent organization I know of in or outside of Bitcoin.  To be honest, I think we are too transparent -- since the board meetings are public we have to constantly be on guard about what is said so it isn't misconstrued etc.  If I am working to create a partnership or recruit some great person, I have to be cautious about what is said and the comments need to be redacted because it's not appropriate to violate the privacy of members or potential partners in the name of transparency.

The odds of generating it at random are....shall we say... low.
I started the calculation but it's hard since the numbers are so large they don't work on PCs or calculators.
But basically:
THE ODDS OF RANDOMLY GENERATING THE SAME ADDRESS ARE 
LESS than the odds of every human on planet earth....each randomly picking the same winning powerball lottery number .... 1,000,000 times per day ..... for 30,000 years ....on 100 billion parallel earths

Someone who has some time to waste &amp; better math, feel free to complete or update
2^160.    BTC addresses =
Odds of generating a duplicate Bitcoin address = 1 in 
Odds of winning Powerball lottery: 
1 in 175,000,000
odds of winning it every day for 30,000 years =
1 in 1,196,250,000,000,000

2) all securities are governed by SEC anyway 
3) FINRA approved the ticker symbol for the fund
4) pointing out they are a FINRA member shows that they do indeed understand compliance and are not trying to do some shady end run as the post I replied to implied - complying with FINRA regs is more strict than simply complying with SEC regs as FINRA members must comply with all SEC regs anyway....as well as a number of additional requirements -- the fact that they have a ton of experience doijg this and Winklevoss has no experience is relevant

Hi!  Maybe some, I suppose it depends who and the context.   
One question might be what the end-goal /hope or ask that Blockchain Alliance has is.  For example is the hope that good engagement would lead to a senior DHS/TSA official testifying to lawmakers:  "Yes, the tech is new and scary, however we've had productive conversations with industry leaders and we're confident that most use is legitimate our enforcement efforts will work. Relative to the benefits, we think there would be drawbacks of additional laws and regs."   That, for example, could be a decent victory -- if it's defined as an actual goal of the initiative and worked towards.  I think it would be very optimistic to think that would happen and think the efforts might be better spent with us directly engaging the lawmakers, setting up best practices, engaging the public and most importantly building great tech.
It doesn't seem common for enforcement agencies to do this...and an initiative working to influence policy might have better avenues to do that.  
Are there many successful models we can look to where these enforcement agencies have been productive tech partners?  Have telecom or Isp/ Internet groups made similar partnerships that worked well?  It would be great to see who we can model success from.
 
If we look at existing issues like the drug war, firearms and other issues we often hear major officials from law enforcement who....even though they disagree with a law....still don't have the ability or will to stand against it...it seems rare.  In that regard this effort seems a roundabout way to influence regulators.
With these partitical agencies it seems the influence would be less because these are generally not the agencies dealing with Bitcoin -- the DHS/ TSA or ICE Immigration service has no real involvement with Bitcoin now....they are not enforcing MSB licenses or Bitlicence or overseeing Circle or asking to audit Coinbase (as far as I know).   Their only involvement with Bitcoin is very, very minimal -- so the types of regs we want to reduce or influence are not really in their realm of influence it would seem.
I don't want to come off as a fringe anti-government person.  I'd much prefer to be in the middle and have some others on one side fighting harder against government overreach and regs with some on the opposite side working with govt more.   However, there isn't much of a voice against this even though there is clearly a large number of people who are.  
We do have a real and legitimate question in asking:  are these organizations really the type we want to support and partner with?  Are we doing this because we genuinely want to work with them or due to fear?  The DHS/ TSA is widely hated, ICE &amp; FBI have had scandals --- practices of overruling state voters, Constitutional violations, DHS overreach or the vast and illegal domestic spying operations revealed by Snowden are not just tin foil hat theories but real concerns that serious companies like Apple are working on.  Bitcoin is also global...is this work with these particular US domestic enforcement agencies the best path?
Also, does Blockchain Alliance have any "line in the sand" at which this cooperation would cease?   If the FBI liaison says he or she wants to bring in the NSA to discuss IP linking of Bitcoin would this be supported for example?  Similar for blacklisting coins etc.
Also -- it's not popular to say so and its bad politics -- but let's face it, some enforcement efforts are pretty bad.  DHS in August, in the name of "saving us from terrorists" raided the offices of the CEO of website 'rentboy' on suspicion of aiding gay male prostitution.  Aside from being a silly overreach of protecting the homeland -- do we really want to be helping folks who would wish to use blockchain records to chase down customers of this website?  Would we want to track spending of illegal immigrants for deportation?  Seize assets of pot smokers in Colorado who their own voters and lawmakers have declared legal?   When Jerry says we will help get "bad guys" I don't know if he....or certainly most folks in Bitcoin ....has the same idea of who bad guys are as his new partners.
I'm all for engaging with regulators....better yet the elected officials who appoint them as they have the most accountability.
I respect you and all the others involved a great deal and you know more about this and how it unfolded.  
I know your intentions are good.  It seems like some things were not thought out and I hope I'm wrong.   I've reached out to Jerry.  Happy to speak to anyone if it is of any benefit.
@_date: 2015-10-24 03:33:53
No doubt it was significant effort... there are many completely horrible things that take significant effort: writing bad laws, wars etc.
Do you really think for a moment that the ICE (Immigration) and DHS/TSA cares one iota about the Mt. Gox thieves?   Please.   They care about the same nonsense they've always cared about.
Can you point to ANY successful similar partnerships in any tech?
We know that advocacy groups engage in PR, media engagement, blogging,mprotests, boycotts, rallies, conferences, legislator outreach, lobbying, dealing  with regulators and many other proven techniques -- how many partner with groups like the DHS?   About zero why?  Because it's a terrible idea.

You can bring it to a local meetup or if there is a conference in town.
Also you could ask some of the people who deal in these often -- do a google search.
The price would be a premium over coin value - so obviously don't take less than a premium over 10 btc -- not sure the going rate but I've seen them go for fairly high prices

If this $50,000 then Coinbase works fine.
If it's 50,000 Bitcoin then you can contact a trader or the back office of a firm or person who does this:  DCG, Harry Yeh and others, the back office of Circle or PM me &amp; I'd be happy to help.
Generally buying Bitcoin depends on your overall situation, wealth and risk tolerance.  Bitcoin is extremely risky and experimental - you should not invest more than what you can afford to lose.  It could end up going up to a very high value, even many thousands of dollars per coun...it could also go down to almost zero.

Working with enforcement is not how you change public opinion or policy - it's not effective and this is why basically no one does it.  
Industries focus on lawmakers, lobbyists, public PR, ad campaigns, letter writing, protests, rallies, conferences, regulators, letters with leading signatories, academic rearsearch, public speaking, media engagement and many other tactics....we can point to 100 examples of each...but when was the last time you saw an industry outreach to enforcement agencies?

I wouldn't say "lost the support of general membership" its not quantifiable.  Most criticism has always come from non members.   
About one year nine months ago about 10 members out of 1500 left or threatened to resign.  This was not so much due to financial mismanagement but due to bad public relations and being upset with the foundation.
Many of those members stayed and one of the most high profile ones was elected as a board member.
I think the crisis was mostly PR related.  The Bitcoin Foundation had horrible press coverage and several bad press items: Karpeles being a member, Charlie being targeted, rumors of scandal, rumors of impending bad press -- then also high profile criticism such as that by Olivier (who is now a board member) and Andreas.
The finances were also a challenge: high spending combined with volatile price of Bitcoin.

Yes, I'm happy to be a Freemason along with a couple million other people, this is no secret.
It doesn't have anything to do with Bitcoin.  I'm not sure what the specific concern is.
I think the freemasons are a good organization.  As with any organization with so many members there will be a small percentage of bad actors or events -- but as an organization I haven't seen anything which concerned me or any actual evidence that it is come sort of conspiracy with ill intent.
Often critics of freemasonry base the opinion on misconceptions or lack of information.
Some other Freemasons include Richard Pryor, George Washington, Ben Franklin, John Wayne, Mark Twain, Mel Blanc, Harry Houdini, Paul Revere, Sam Adams, Neil Armstrong, Mozart, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and many others.
People can only answer for their own actions, opinions, thoughts and words and the actual actions and missions of those organizations they support.  It's not possible to address theories of what ones motivations might be when based on unsound info.
I'd encourage those concerned about freemasonry to speak with actual freemasons and do objective research.  
One benefit of a math based protocol is that the personal lives, beliefs and religion of those involved should not matter.

This is perfect evidence of the problem.   The blog post (if people even knew about it) says to be sure your email address is updated.

If your 401k plan has an employer match you are essentially getting free money from your employer.  Depending on who you work for this could be as high as 100%.
Also, 401k plans grow tax deffered, Bitcoin is taxable if you follow the law and declare it.
Bitcoin should not be used for retirement planning, it is speculative and you could lose all the money you put into it.
If the $50 / mo is money you can afford to lose then your plan is a decent way to get exposure to the currency.

It's disingenuous to claim that "only six people" have complained when the system by which complaints are counted is the same low-traffic/ little used system which the announcement was made on.
This is at best ignorant and at worse manipulative, misleading and gaming.  Either way it's not accurate and you know it.
There are at least five candidates who are not able to vote due to the poor communication on this issue -- do you really honestly think I am the only candidate who would like to vote?  The fact that people have not complained on the low traffic and difficult to login to forums doesn't mean that those complaints don't exist.
Instead of making excuses why not acknowledge that this was handled in a poor manner?   Also would you care to explain why there was never an announcement on this forum, Bitcoin talk or the other high traffic sites in the space?   Can you explain why the Foundation website makes no mention of the election and why the dates and details are so difficult to find?   
You are blaming this on people "choosing not to vote" while not acknowledging that it was your broken system which is preventing the people from voting who DO CHOOSE to vote....but are not able to.   
The posts you referenced include two newsletters with the information buried in the body of the message and another post which talks about making sure that a member email is up to date...without mentioning the activation process.

1) the low turnout was not due to voter apathy it was due to Foundation incompetence and a broken system of registration
2) there are WAY more than six people who had an issue with this -- candidates and a board member alone account for six people 
3) to name me as one of only six people who complained is completely and totally misleading and was gamed to inaccurately make it seem that I was one of a small minority of half a dozen people who complained -- this is completely and totally false and an extremely inappropriate action for a Foundation public announcement made mentioning a candidate DURING an election

I don't see how anyone can be against those things and then not only work with....but go out of their way to proactively partner with the organizations doing those things.  
 It seems terrible.   Flip side, what is the greatest possible upside?  DHS is so charmed by Bitcoin that they start giving speeches about how great we are?   It is such a profoundly bad plan it defies logic.
The most obvious root of this is that Weinstien -- a guy who until recently never did anything with Bitcoin and had no connections until BitFury...what's tk drum up more legal work for his firm...so he pitched his partners on this and they supported the pro-bono effort.   In exchange, he is now a Bitcoin player and can rub elbows with all these CEOs to boost his legal practice.   Someone whose worked with large law firms like I have please tell me I'm wrong.

Right now there is a runoff election for the four leading candidates from the general election:

This election will elect two Board members to replace the two seats which will be open.

When was the stock pumped and dumped?   Before the reverse merger?
Are you saying that all reverse mergers are bad and that companies should be judged by what the shells did before they were involved?
The CEO has been very open about the status of the company and that he has sought to use the advantages of public status to provide Bitcoin exposure to people.  You would know this if you did research and talked to him before making accusations.

I'm not "playing dumb" - you seem to have an issue with all reverse mergers on the pink sheets.
Have you read the company plans?   This is a brand new venture.  Just starting to get moving.   Having status as public company opens all kinds of doors to potential investment, JVs, financing and other opportunities.  I believe the CEO is acting in good faith and desires to do as he says which is to use the platform to become a large and successful Bitcoin company.
I'm sorry you disagree based on your hunch or dislike of the web design or whatever else you are basing this off of.  I've met with Chales Allen and spoken to him and I believe he is genuine in his efforts.  If you have some evidence otherwise, produce it.

Bitcoin Foundation uses Cloudflare - we are DDOSed often, like all Bitcoin sites - it also helps load time for pages run from a database.

Thanks, the alliance overall does not seem interested in alternative views from what I've seen.
I was attacked a bit for my criticism.  The two thinkgs which bother me : 
1) the fallacy that this is an argument of libertarianism versus engagement - it's not, one can believe in engagement and still think that this alliance is a terrible idea
2) the dismissal of alternative views - the implication that my views are "fringe" or won't help Bitcoin go mainstream is absurd -- I have personally been regulated by financial regulators in the US and globally more than anyone in the alliance

We've beat this to death.  At the time Nasdaq ran a regulator and later became FINRA.   Didn't Madofff ALSO sit on that regulation sub committee?   Why the obsession with this?   The point was that Madoff was an insider (the "ultimate insider" according to an article on nasdaqs own page) and had special relationships with those who were supposed to make things safe.

Because I have proven my point many, many times.
Bernie Madoff was Chair of NASDAQ, which ran NASD-R -- he was also on the board of governors of the NASD and I'm 90% sure he was on the committee which had oversight over the NASD.
I don't understand the obsession with this

@_date: 2015-02-03 13:11:33
I'd encourage use of basic logic.
This event was planned long before I planned to run for the board.
If you think of the logic involved in setting up the logistics of bringing this many people to a place with this complexity -- does that really make sense as the most effective way to get 50 votes or so when memberships are $25?
Wouldn't it have been more sensible to hold a rally in Boston, 10 miles from my home and spend tens of thousands of dollars getting people to join and vote for me?    Wouldn't it have been more sensible to do the event some time other than after the deadline for joining the foundation to vote?
Also, other candidates running against me are also invited.
I'd encourage people to just think this through.
@_date: 2015-02-13 17:53:10
I still don't see how having the stock ticker is an issue.
The plan of the company is to use the advantages of being in the public markets to build something which provides public investors with exposure to Bitcoin and related investments.   I think it's a great idea and I had thought of the same thing ages ago.  Allen ran with it and made BTCS.

You've posted the same point about 10 times on this thread.  It's inaccurate to say that people don't care which is why they didn't vote.
You reference an email that was from some time ago.  Not everyone got the email.  Candidates I assure you would be interested in voting.  We all took the trouble to print, sign and send back a hard copy form.  The several of us who didn't activate simply didn't know about this requirement.

There have been a few similar incidents.  Those who speak at conferences often regularly have people gather a couple well known speakers and use those names to get registrations and also other speakers on board.  Sometimes the event and organizer is just shady and over aggressive promotionaly and other times it is an outright fraud that intends to steal the registration and sponsorship money.  Sometimes people will be listed as speakers when they are not actually speakers and have never 
Fortunately, most speakers know each other pretty well and will set alarm bells off and warn others pretty fast.   I know of a few events which have been stopped due to good communications by speakers between themselves.

I like paper wallets.  I think they are one of the most powerful and under utilized aspects of the tech.  I carry a pile of them (BIP 38 password protected of course) and use them all the time.
I think that more people should know more about the capabilities of these...IMHO it's one of the core, pure, fundamental features of Bitcoin :  the ability to have complete control, independent of any third party, backed up and secure.
@_date: 2015-02-01 18:21:20
Interesting perspective Luke.  Clearly there is a handful of  people -- like you -- who have a great deal of knowledge on the code -- but IMHO Andreas would meet the standard of expert.
I might have a different standard of expert -- 
My standard would be something like top 1% of knowledge in the field, something like Bitcoin which has so few people who know even the basics, I'd consider almost everyone who works in the space an expert.  Certainly you, other core devs, authors speakers... even people who don't have half that knowledge like me, and I'd be first to admit that I'm not nearly as knowledgeable as you or Andreas.   
But we are talking about explaining to a jury of regular people who, most likely never have heard of Bitcoin at all.

They will make fake prospectuses, have fake audited statements etc just like Madoff did.

He once invited me to stay at his squat in London.   I had no idea what a "squat" was, I thought it was some British term like "flat".  It's actually when you break into an unused building you don't own and take it over.  In this case the former G6 government building.  It was run down with no running water but an interesting experience.  There were several developer/ Bitcoin / hacker folks.   They had grabbed power and wifi from neighboring buildings and had ways to get food etc.
The squat reminded me a lot of the hacker HQ in the final season of 24 with the Julian Assange style character.  But the real place wasn't as cinematic.
He is a smart guy and we had some interesting conversations.  Some people I am freinds with and respect a lot are not fans of Amir but he was nice during the short time I met him.

Lots of prominent people drop off this sub due to trolling.
Afaik Sean's Outpost still exists, is still going and doing great work.
The founder, Jason King is still active in Bitcoin and is working on an amazing app called Unsung.
As far as accusations, he addressed them here some time ago.  Knowing Jason and considering him a friend, my take on the accusations and his response is basically that he is open about some bumps in the road in his past -- regarding Sean's Outpost specifically he probably could have been better about accounting and paperwork but it clearly was not a scam designed to enrich him.  
Just do the math: clearly Satoshi Forest exists and the mortgage has been being paid, clearly there has been spending on lawyers for the lawsuits won and for the meals served - he may have had weak paperwork but there really isn't much room for unaccounted funds anyway.
Some learning from the process helped inspire Unsung which has a lot of built in transparency and tracking about what meals are served to homeless people.
Check it out it's a cool app:  Uber for feeding homeless people.

There's two main reasons that the halving could cause a price increase:
1) speculation
2) lack of supply
The speculation was already built in as everyone knew the halving was coming.  There was unlikely to be a rapid skyrocket in price the day after halving as people suddenly realized "What?!? Only HALF the coins?! OMG! Buy!!"
Since this was figured in, that leaves basic supply and demand.
Well, thats simple, there are just about 1800 coins less per day being mined.   
Lots of miners sell coins automatically to cover obligations to debt, investors, fixed costs etc.
Whatever of the previous 3600 / day was sold adjusted to whatever portion of the 1800 will be sold is the difference in supply.
The maximum impact possible is 1800 bitcoins or $1.17 million / day less dollars worth of coins based on today's price.
Suppose this halving causes half of the maximum impact -- that's around $500k-600k / day less supply.  Volume over the last 24 hours is $100 mil -- but remember that includes both buys and sells and many of the same coins trading back and forth.
With 500k/ less available we might be looking at a .5% increase / day all else being equal.  (All else is not equal, there are 100 other factors and this is way oversimplified) some of this is already figured into the price from the last run up.
If everything else is equal that would mean that the price would be 673 in a week, 693 in two weeks, 751 in a month and 876 in two months.  Like I said though, everything is not equal and many other factors can and will affect the price: press coverage, the price itself, news/ announcements - even summer being a time when less people typically trade or mess with finances.  Bad news can kill this momentum - miners could sell more than half the coins or the differential could be way different something could cause some investors to lose faith.  Likewise, a rise over 60 days to the 850 levels could attract new interest and a new rise in price beyond any effect the halving supply contributes. 
Bitcoin could go to 1000 or 0.  
TLDR: Lots of factors involved but we shouldn't expect a rapid/ radical price rise from the halving - all else being equal there COULD be a nice, steady rise over coming weeks... best case, this rise, in turn, increases stability and attracts more interest and new investors.

ETF could be great but it alone is very unlikely to drive it to that high a level.
An ambitious high end hope would be to hope that the ETF reaches the size of a large mutual fund or hedge fund...say $80-100 billion range....or about 10x today's price.   Not bad to be sure, but not 100k from that alone.

Unfortunately this discussion seems to be regressing in some ways and sides more dug in.
2mb used to be considered a low end compromise for the people asking for 8mb or 32 or whatever.
As I understand, Adam Back, who is clearly on the "core side" once proposed a plan that would increase to 2mb and it seemed that there was not a major issue with many devs or anyone speculating that it would cause massive problems.
Now 2mb seems to be the enemy.  Hopefully this has not become more about winning than logic for anyone.
I'm not a dev and am smart enough to know I'm not smart on this and that it's very very complex.   However it really seems that some resistance to even an increase to 2mb has increased rather than moved closer together.
There is a ton of emotion involved in this process and hopefully that has not played a role in the increased opposition.

Good job to my favorite a-holes.  ;)
Everyone who cares about this industry should support exposing scams like this --- especially ones that prey on seniors.
We need an army of us to show up at these type of events and expose them.
There are few more sure fire ways to bring regulatory burden and bad laws on to good people in crypto than to let bad people push scams on seniors.  
Seniors vote and have influence and are a huge regulatory hot button.
In the investment world there are whole separate sets of regulations under FINRA and various state securities regulators governing interacting with seniors: what words can be used, how marketing is done etc.   In Massachusetts I believe it's even forbidden to use the word in a seminar invite (as in "Come by for breakfast and learn 'Stock Strategies for Senior Citizens'")

I'm not clear what exactly you are alleging of BTCS or what you are claiming I did.
"Obvious pump and dump" is not a substantial claim -- it would be much more substantive if you backed it up with specifics -- for example if there was a lawsuit, specific allegation of wrong doing or allegation of fraud. 
It is a penny stock so as such is extremely risky- even more so because it is in a speculative space.
Yes I serve as an advisory board member.   Is there some specific concern you have other than the interview mentioned above?
The CEO gives many interviews, he's been on CNBC and other news media many times.
In my experience, "pump and dumps" are stocks with no merit or plan who simply seek to inflate the price so people can sell.   In my observation that is not the goal of this company's CEO, Charles Allen - in the conversations I've had with him he is very focused on building a larger and more valuable company.

I believe there is no way to make a three character password secure, too short - unless you used Chinese, Japanese and English characters or something (if that's even possible to have supported, I don't think it is).... but straight letters and numbers, no way - it could be cracked in minutes or hours at best.
There are tools online that can estimate how long it will take to crack a given password ....adding random characters, upper and lower case, numbers etc all make it harder and of course a 40 character password is not 10 times better than a 4 character password, it's billions of times better.

I gave a speech in Orlando at Coins in the Kingdom on Oct 4-5 2014.  We had gotten beat and beat and beat some more.  Sponsors were all broke there were zero venture capitalists in site, lawyers and accountants wouldn't bother going to the conference because Bitcoin had lost...no one had any money other than those smart enough to have cashed out at $600 or more.
We saw $1100 come and go...most of us lost a bunch of money at Mt. Gox earlier that year.  We kept the faith as $1100 went to $900, then $600.  We endured a long slow year of negative price news, chip by chip we lost value.  By the time we got on the plane to go to the conference it was $400.  Someone who had a $100,000 life savings in Bitcoin now had $40k (or 20k or 0 if a Gox customer).  By day two of the conference it would be $33k.  Bitcoin had fallen to $333... it was a third of its peak value,  Buttcoin, a troll sub which was much more popular back then gleefully declared that they had been right.  Bitcoin had died.  The few funded startups went lean, some made layoffs.  Many of the few VCs exited the space.
Were we depressed and in despair?  Nah.  We were psyched.  The conference was even happier than any today.  We all got along.  There was no scaling debate.  Roger and Gavin were loved and respected, devs were revered and miners where high fived.
I asked the crowd "Is this it?  Is this the end of Bitcoin?"
"Fuck no" was the reply.
I quoted from Shakespeare Henry V "band of brothers...we happy few" speech.  (This wasn't that dramatic as it's hard to pull off unless you are a trained actor.  :))  But overall it was a fun speech &amp; conference.
I can't speak for others but I think those of us who where there, those of us who said HODL in the face of adversity just never lost faith in the tech.  
There were not really many competing ideas: no Eth really, we had Litecoin, obviously no ICOs and not really much speculation on blockchain or it being used for much more than money.
We just figured that money...if that was the only killer app..digital money would be worth more than $10 billion.  Most of us had gone into this hard and seen 2/3 of our net worth gone.  Those with Bitcoin businesses even worse: customers scarce, investors abandoning ship, revenues not materializing, regulatory pressures.   So what do we have to do?  Yes...you guessed it...sell Bitcoins (even though we know they will go up) just to pay the bills.  You know, 10 coins to pay the mortgage, 20 coins to meet payroll 2 doe the car payment ....that kind of thing.
Ouch.   By the way those who had bought into the Ethereum crowd sale (at about $0.33 per ETH) now had nothing to show for it.  Suppose you put $10,000 worth of Bitcoin into the ETH crowd sale -- that would be 20 Bitcoin for anout 40,000 ETH.  Dammit!  Worthless!  Ethereum Foundation was going broke -- the $18 mil they raised in the crowdsale was now a fraction of that...both spent and declined in value (because they held Bitcoin ...obviously the ETH crowdsale wasn't funded with ETH).  Many thought ETH would never be worth anything.
We kept optimistic.

It's a good idea but one problem honestly is that the size of the market is very small -- you have to take the market size for stock photos AND then the percentage of people who want to use Bitcoin - then market to them.
If you can build this simply and cheaply and find a good bulk source of stock photos (like one partnership with a library or being an official outlet for a major photography club or something) then it could work.

There is nothing wrong with the organization today and it has some of the best financial controls, transparency and accountability of any group in the industry.

Some math to think it through:  one user here estimated that he raised 100k
I thought it was more like 200-240k or so.
Let's say it was 240.
Subtract from that all meals, the mortgage on Satoshi Forest, building supplies, legitimate travel, the legal fees for the times Sean's Outpost sued the city, any other things they needed to buy that were not donated.
Suppose all that cost 60k / year for four years -- that's 100% of the funds raised.
So suppose he managed to do it for half that ...meaning he did this very elaborate con just to steal 30k a year?  (which, by the way, would be a low salary for a non profit employee anyway) why wouldn't he just pay himself a salary from the non profit?
These numbers just don't add up.
There are tons of cons a scams in Bitcoin.   But people should be very careful about making accusations against someone without evidence.

My main worry is and has been a major event such as a 9-11 scale attack, traced to Bitcoin and a knee jerk overkill reaction that declares it a felony to own Bitcoin.
Luckily the chances of this decrease with every new entrant and dollar invested.
And for those who say "China doesn't care about US law" -- incorrect.  One call from the Secty of State and pretty much any country on earth other than Iran or North Korea would do whatever the US said -- no one would risk a trillion dollar trade partner with the most aggressive military to protect a geek money experiment with &lt;$10 billion in value. 
I think today this is very unlikely -- major corporations, investors, individuals and so on have embraced Bitcoin so a crazy knee jerk reaction will be met with a lot more opposition than it would have 2 years ago.

If you think 18% turnout, no announcement of the election on the website and at least five candidates, several board members and several early long-time members not voting due to an obscure process is not in need of improvement then I'm not the right candidate for you.

When did I say that?   I didn't.   You said candidates deserve no sympathy and I asked if long time members etc deserve sympathy ....you answer is apparently no, they don't -- you are fine with 18% turnout and many long time people not voting.   
As I said before, let's agree to disagree.   
You think this is a swell example of an election and it doesn't really matter if the election does not accurately reflect the wishes of the voters, that 364 is a tiny number and easy to game and that there will be many members who won't get to vote when they would like to...but after all, no sympathy.   I get it.   I respectfully disagree.  Give it a rest.

Well depends on the nature of the meeting.
The "smoke filled room" theory would be counterproductive-- but this meeting purpose is not to that end and I don't think these participants would join if that was the case.
There are tons of private meetings of course every day in this space:  VC meetings, gatherings, dinners etc., even weddings!   What's different is that this is a bit larger and more structured, but it's still the same privacy standard -- privacy doesn't equate with ill intent.  In fact, today it's often privacy that's needed to counter an invasive government.

You are assuming that the reason we generally see less fraud with banks is because of regulations.  I don't think that's the case.  
Banking is a more mature market with more competition and with older and established players.
There is also tons of fraud still within banking and the old financial system: stockbrokers, financial advisors etc.
People who are going to rob someone are not prevented by regs.

No attendee at all was willing to release video of them speaking.
We also had some challenges with the videographer.
I gave one short opening speech which I will release as promised.
The format just wasn't suited for video -- I had thought a few people would request that thier video be public but no one did. 
Over 70% of the agenda was meals and informal chats with people talking while sitting by the beach or having some drinks.
Each day we had a lunch, a dinner, one day a cocktail party and each day also a coffee break or two.
Of the presentations - each person had 7-10 minutes and spoke on a variety of topics.
We also had an open format Roundtable which allowed anyone to discuss anything.
I know that some people wanted more video but I simply can't force people to be covered by video if they prefer to have those words remain private.

You'll be doing a transaction at some point - at that point all coins are at risk.
You have two (or more) private keys...whatever method you use to access funds is a security risk and you risk ALL coins.  If you have $1 mil worth and only need $50k that's a risk.
Why not separate them?  Extra wallets are free &amp; easy to set up.  What's the drawback?  A bit more setup and organization -- drawback worth it relative to risk.

Part of the economics of Bitcoin are that they are fungible and transactions are not blockable or reversible.  
We couldn't re-issue ones with lost private keys because there is no way to prove the keys were lost. 
Bitcoin send to burn addresses / bad addresses likewise should remain gone from the system because it's part of how the supply works. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 15:35:28
If you think having 5 separate people (or yourself accessing 5 separate keys) on a million dollar wallet every time you need $100 is better than keeping smaller amounts siloed and firewalled from the rest that's your prerogative.  Do whatever you think is most secure.   
@_date: 2015-02-03 02:08:38
The catch 22 with discussions like this is that some people will be angry at not enough discussion, openness or transparency....others will accuse this as being a PR effort.

These numbers are always ridiculously high and hard to calc, every time I see this discussion there seems to be an error on the math, let alone the assumptions.
For example above it looks like you might have missed a /24 (for hours with 3600 for seconds per hour)
The global computing power is no where near a million times more than the Bitcoin network.
Bitcoin passes over 250 times the speed of the top 500 supercomputers combined. 
I had 20.88 trillion

Because it's so incredibly complex and difficult.
Technically it can be.  Based on global computer power we have now if all computers on planet earth worked in unison to brute force it, it would still take something like 700 million years.
You could also try to guess it.  But you need to hope for good luck because the odds of guessing it are about the same as winning every lottery in human history and every lottery there ever will be for the next 3000 years.
Or as Jim Carrey in Dumb &amp; Dumber would say "So you're saying there's a chance!"

Afaik and from what you said above, Genesis isn't a scam - it's staing the terms and what to expect right upfront.
They sell you what they say they will sell you at the pride they say they will.  The fact that that hash power b comes near worthless isn't a function of anything Genesis caused but a factor of market forces.

Sorry to be the voice of dissent but I like Coinbase and I think they do a great job.
When it comes to the ridiculous and burdensome KYC / AML requirements we can thank the army of unelected bureaucrats and, much worse, the members of this "community" who actively solicit and support those industry organizations who proactively ask for new regulations and more enforcement protocols.
The biggest enemy, by far, is the organizations who proactively ask for new regulation.
As far as Coinbase specifically, they want to be compliant, we can't blame them for that.  For other issues they have growing pains like all companies but as a customer I think they do a great job and as a Bitcoiner I think they are great for the industry.   
Let's work together to be productive, constructive and help them where we can while fighting those who push for more regs as well.
