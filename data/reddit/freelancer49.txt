Monopoly in the sense that anyone else who uses violence in the area they protect is not allowed to do so.  This theoretical company is the only group allowed to do violence in the area that they are paid to protect, anyone else who commits violence in this area is stopped.  Therefore, they have a monopoly on violence.  You could also use the phrase "complete control of" but monopoly means the same thing.  
This is not the same as a market monopoly, which is what you are referring to.  People may switch defense providers at will given multiple competing contractors.  However there will only ever be one group in control of violence in an area at any one time.

I think something your argument is missing that's very important is that money is not the only motivator for amassing power.  Power for power's sake is a very strong motivator for many people.  Even if it were impossible to make money from holding power, people would still seek power for power's sake.  
So in your example, instead of extorting money, maybe the man on the street promotes the creation of a group based on his desire for power.  He convinces people to join him based on religion, or maybe he promises monetary rewards, or he may even just promise more power to his supporters.  It doesn't matter to him that it isn't profitable, he wants the power and so do his followers.

The end result doesn't change, but it makes the argument that "violence wouldn't occur because it isn't profitable" harder to make, since monetary profit isn't the only motivator for violence.
