what? ELI5 why this is possible, and people with the capital don't just "buy BTC low, sell it high" between different markets, which would ultimately equal the exchanges?

The hesitation between buying more with money I can't really lose, or holding on to my few Euro's and quite possibly missing a great investment opportunity... It's killing me.  
  
**Edit**: Well thanks for cooling me down guys. Needed some wisdom I suppose. It's still hard: I've got two nice degrees and will surely make OK money later. I've got parents who can afford to lend me cash interest-free. I quit smoking and don't own a car. These are all nagging, whispering in my ear:  
  
*"Now or never. This step to virtual currency can only occur once and you're in the middle of it. This is a discrete historic event with great catalysts (like the public losing faith in governments) and every news channel you respect is telling you exactly the same thing. Buy them."*

Thanks for the consolidation.  
  
However, I predict people consciously moving away from government controlled finances as the whole '1% vs 99%' and 'the government is watching you' issues reach the ears of the common folk. Furthermore the way our life is moving online etc...  
  
But I do hope we are running too high right now. I plan on buying BTC, turning them into online EUR asap, and then hold those until a crash.

I don't think he really doesn't know what BTC is, he's just trying to make BTC sound bad to people who don't yet know.

Sure did, I'm on their plan as well. I might downgrade to €10 buys as I just can't use 2GB/mo on my mobile phone.
