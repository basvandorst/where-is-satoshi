First argument: you satirically say "censorship is bad" and say doge and litecoin should be allowed here if we allow XT. 
I show why this logic is flawed.
Argument 2 (nothing to do with argument one): you say XT has only been popular lately because of the controversy. (I must admit, I only assumed you were still arguing the point XT shouldn't be allowed with this comment; even though that wasn't explicitly said)
I accuse you of moving the goalposts.

Bad taste? Maybe. Is it true it would take a bite out of their profit? Absolutely (for a time at least). Is their their only reason for wanting to keep blocks small? We don't know for sure, however, it is a very interesting coincidence. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:59:27
Leaving out *clearly* different things (doge and lite) is way different than completely banning something that a large portion of the community thinks should be here, regardless of personal opinion.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:55:47
But he is. The miners will never switch without a network to send their blocks on. If every miner switched to XT today, they'd be *super* pissed in 5 days when their blocks are useless.... The community running nodes ARE voting. Stop trying to tell people they aren't. It's wrong.
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:21:46
Just like they've been doing right?.... *sigh
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:38:08
is super biased. XT doesn't break consensus, it *waits* for it before it changes anything. It's opposed by a majority of developers because most (not all) of them work for a company that has vested interest in keeping blocks small.
There are some people who want bigger blocks without having any idea what it means - then there is the majority who actually understand what's going on.
XT isn't an alt-coin. It's branded as that by those who are vehemently opposed to it. Please do some research and make a decision for yourself, not what reddit tells you to do.

I don't. That would put it in the "huge issue" category. A||B
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:31:58
Fraud. Funny. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:56:58
I think we'd all like to see it in core instead. They tried for a long time and couldn't make it work. A fork was really the only other option.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:05:47
Sorry. You're wrong. If it doesn't get enough hashing power, nothing will change....
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:58:40
Yes, but not as a relay node, only verifying. At least that's what I understand. I am by no means an expert.
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:59:32
Get rid of the garbage. I would hope that there is some type of review system where the mods can see what others are deleting. Punt them.
@_date: 2015-08-16 12:14:37
Then every time we've had a fork of any type, we've changed coins and "rebranded it bitcoin". I'm okay with doing that again.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:23:32
The problem is we can't pinpoint a time when it will "need more scale" without being "Oh shit we needed more scale a month ago." These things take time to prepare for without chaos. That's what we're trying to do.
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:56:26
I think something like this may be able to take over when miner fee makes up a decent portion of the reward for a block, but honestly not until then. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 13:24:46
Not true. Some of my posts have had to be specifically allowed. At least they're letting them through. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:21:14
On, I wont deny that even a little bit. No question there.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:24:27
Do the mods have right to be able to only allow x amount of karma vote? Or anything of that sort?
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:09:23
For the masses maybe. I've been interested for a while. However, what does that have to do it being on or off topic? Nice moving of the goalposts.
@_date: 2015-08-16 18:08:51
If the community as a whole is doing the censoring, that's way different than 3-4 people doing it. If the community doesn't want to see something, I'm okay with that. If 3-4 people don't want the community to see something that the community is ASKING to see, there is an issue.
I'm not an extremist, I just got pissed last night so I made a new account.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:39:38
I don't have the expertise to do this, so I ask you: Fork it, take out the changes, let us know where to find it and I'll run that instead of XT...
People! This is open source! If there is something you don't like and have the ability to change, DO IT! I wish I did. We can have 97 different clients running slight variations of code. That's all fine by me as long as the network still 1) verifies correct transactions (form, signed, has the BTC) 2) puts them into blocks 3) verifies blocks (PoW et. al.). That's it. 
We need to stop thinking like closed source MS Windows followers.
@_date: 2015-08-16 17:15:02
You were arguing one point and it got shot down, so you started arguing a second - irrelevant - point trying to use it to prove the first one.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:59:56
haha. XT is not an alt, and to call it that is a very big stretch. 
It's only called that because people want to discredit it. If everyone agreed to make the change, it would happen no problem and no one would complain about the "alt coin" change. It's a fork. Same coin.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:06:41
First time seeing this. It basically looks like an SPV relay node (of sorts). As long as they are the minority on the network I don't see this an a huge issue, even if I would never run one myself.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:28:05
Nope. Just don't move anything until everything settles down unless you know what you're doing, or have someone that you trust helping you out.
@_date: 2015-08-16 16:42:14
its the sheer number of people who have to make the change. Miners, exchanges, wallet producers.... Lots of people. If we hit an "oh shit" moment (BTC takes off overnight) we're screwed. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:48:51
I'm not talking about this morning, I'm talking about since yesterday when all the garbage started (getting bad) around here.
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:54:48
Because my main account name doesn't show my frustration with the garbage that's been happening around here lately.
@_date: 2015-08-16 00:48:14
It is hard to change consensus, however, it can be done. It would (currently) require a large portion of the network to communicate blocks. Enough for the miners to feel confident enough to risk blowing a *lot* of money if they are wrong. If their blocks don't get propagated or accepted by merchants or exchanges. It wont happen. So when the miners feel that's the case, they'll switch. Then we have to wait for 75% of the miners to make blocks.... That. Is. Consensus.  
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:45:52
I don't see miners ever making a change that has that high of a likelihood of causing them to lose money. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 15:25:09
While it sounds good, I think in practice this would end with a whole lot of frustration, wasted money and orphaned blocks. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:51:38
Even still. Over time I see it working out better than 4-5 people imposing their opinion on the majority.
@_date: 2015-08-15 23:09:29
While so far I've been liking it, IMO, this isn't the way to promote it.
