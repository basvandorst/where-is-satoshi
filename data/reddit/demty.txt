I keep seeing on here wait wait wait it'll drop. I honestly don't see it happening but I keep waiting because a drop and my greed wants something that probably won't happen. I guess if I buy now and see a drop I can take comfort in knowing I didn't say I would eat my dick.

Let me tell you the problem with that thought. I have 22k in my 401k atm. With my income and living expenses I pretty much break even. I never cared about money but I see so much potential. In 5 weeks I saw my 120$ investment turn into $300 buying a spread of alts. If I take out a loan it forces me to use less money every month to keep even, and i pay back myself with interest. Every day I kick myself that I haven't already invested more. Choices choices.

May the force be with you.

Its exploding right now!! Hold on to your butts! Tore ass right through the 150 coin buy wall at 17000. And still trucking up! Goddamn this is an exciting time to be hodling!
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:41:09
True. But if the stock market crashes tomorrow I lose it anyway. Im not really willing to lose my retirement. Thank for you for this. In this case I will hodl!!! My 401k and invest a hundred or so loose change every month instead.

Your in your 30s. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:59:48
Ive been reading these posts and waiting. Problem with waiting is it could go up, only up. Then dip to where it was when you first considered buying. Anything sub 20k if a steal. After 20k its going to surge. Think about it how long does it take for new people to get in, a few days? a week? People are flooding in this week and next due to the major media blast. Id say buy the hell right now and have no regrets.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:30:54
Its taking a beating right now. Sub 9k I start rolling around in the snow naked.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:20:32
And reinvesting could net you more millions. Just saying...
@_date: 2017-12-04 00:14:04
It's kind of funny. You see massive sell offs I bet so they can try and get in at a lower price. Then they see it doesn't stay low and buy back in at a higher price. I can hear their sweat hit the floor. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:41:37
Fast fareward to june 2018 bitcoin hits ATH of 50k. Don't sweat the numbers and counting losses. Just wait it out and be glad you have a piece of history.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:46:20
Got in at 17k and 15k. I'm happy I did win or lose at least I pulled the trigger. No regrets.

It's a retirement savings plan that's invested in the stock market. I can take up to 50% as a loan that I pay myself back on with each paycheck and can stretch it out for up to 5 years or so. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 11:19:01
Nevermind last week it was on the front page of all the prestigous finance newspapers. It's impossible to ignore. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:40:16
You may be right. It's a gamble for sure. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:05:44
I think your right. If we see a major correction it'll shoot up again. I think in the mid term bit coin will be the winner. Long term like 20 years I think other better coins will rule the market but for the next 5 or 10 years bit coin should be the clear winner. I think it'll be good up to 50 or 100k or even more.

I want to say I would too but is watching ;-) Way to go OP!!! There's some good left in the world!
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:28:33
I bet you checked the price 10 times since this post. :-P
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:50:16
I don't own any. But I think I may take some of my retirement money and buy one. Think about it. It's the original. It's the coca cola of crypto. Think about the kids growing up and hearing about bitcoin. Not everyone can own one. And one is barely available to the general public it being at 7k. I think I'm going to get one.

Yes sell while you still can. When you see it go back to 6k then 5k then 4.5k everyone will panic sell and say goodnight for awhile. I'm suspecting the whales/politics will force the price low before the fork to get in cheap before the explosion happens. 
@_date: 2015-08-10 12:55:42
You can't stop a moving train. We continue to roll forward nothing will stop us. Proxy's, Tor, VPNs, torrents, good luck FBI...
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:30:19
9344 you mean?
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:54:00
already dipped below 7k. PANIC SELLING!!
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:03:11
I just saw it at 9,600. This is freaking mayhem.

Saying its a shitpost with a shitpost. Nice touch.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:18:45
At a particular block. Est. Nov 16 last I checked. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:53:15
Agreed. That 10% I get on my 401k can't touch the growth rate of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:40:12
It's pretty clear the move. The question is will it be the right one? I doubt bitcoin will die off during the fork and there's massive $ to be made here. The only issue I see is a group initially sending legacy up just to backtrack and lower segwit2x's price just to make off with more $
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:56:17
below 7k now

Someone contact Tom Delonge for access to the time machine.

This isn't always a sure fire way. Legitimate sites can always have scam reviews. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 00:58:11
While I think your right on the initial tanking, in the long run technology will overcome the beast. That said selling off your segwit2x for legacy, then after the initial dump buy and hope it rises might be the play here. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:53:56
Been happy with bittrex. But not sure about thousands of dollars. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:48:03
I don't frequent this sub very often and I could be wrong but from what I read is that segwit2x is the future, and will capture the publics $. Maybe the FUD wants you to buy into legacy just to steal your $? Mind you I frequent a lot. ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:58:07
Truth. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 23:52:13
I'm not trying to piss anyone off. It's a valid opinion. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 16:59:56
anyone buying in right now is idiotic. Bitcoin will panic sell until the 16th. Alts are going to skyrocket with bitcoin capital.
@_date: 2019-04-01 19:58:15
Not many people here remember the &lt; 200 bitcoin days. I was pumping out many a bitcoin and getting really messed up. Ahhh the glory days...
@_date: 2019-04-01 19:59:30
That is rediculous!! 
@_date: 2017-11-09 22:52:12
That's the problem. I hear horror stories of people that are unable to sell theirs. And it being banned? I doubt it. A lot of companies would protest the ban with strong lawyers. I think it's here to stay. Now getting fiat for you crypto in the next few years may not be mainstream.

Dude did some wrong things and made some poor choices. If your going to have an alias and run some crazy drug bazaar make sure not to include your email on one of your posts. Then advertise it. And get caught by your own stupidity.
