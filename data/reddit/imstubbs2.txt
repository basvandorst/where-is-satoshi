But then again....it is Gizmodo!

What's up with their transactions? More people selling?
@_date: 2018-01-02 19:24:18
Really praying that you wrote the seed down....otherwise....you screwed.

This is more of a question about your shift card, but do you get your paycheques directly deposited into the shift card? If so, how?
@_date: 2018-01-02 05:59:10
That's literally all it is. There is no mining. They created a set limit and then are now advocating banks to use their payment system. It's owned by a company that sells to banks and companies. It's 100% centralized.

I'm in the same boat. I've been editing for 3 weeks for Gemini
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:04:52
It is not hold on for dear life. See earlier responses 
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:08:09
This is real. I verified it myself. My wife thought it was funny. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:15:11
Did you even read the post? Or just instantly just want to start trolling? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:15:55
They are so cancerous and nothing but "to the moon" crap. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:44:16
Ohhh I gotcha. That makes sense. I'm sorry for misunderstanding.

Awww poo. Well I guess I suck at helping :(
@_date: 2017-12-19 03:02:39
Of course the bankers would say this. Because they are losing their business because of cryptocurrencies. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:13:54
Any legal experts it would be great to hear from you on this matter. Because if this proves that bitcoin is a currency and is used as money laundering then would we no longer have to claim our bitcoin gains as an asset, but rather like interest from a savings account?

Says the actual convicted criminal that he is. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:44:45
I didn't know that was a thing actually. So maybe there is no such thing anymore. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:28:11
True, but if you just refer them with no clarification it's like telling a child to go to a store and pick up milk...well what kind of milk? How much milk? What percentage of milk? Goats milk or cow milk? If they are coming here for help then they are clearly lost. So why send them off to another place to be even more lost. Do this community a solid and either help them specifically. Or scroll past the post and ignore them. Because sending them elsewhere without specifics does nothing to help. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 04:20:04
I actually do not. Lemme guess. Roger Ver?
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:21:09
That is very true. Sometimes, especially with mining we have to give them the cold hard facts about it now. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:15:04
So...gay people cant invest?
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:05:06
Sell it to me for a fair price and I'll use western Union to send you money. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:36:41
Same thing as a dick turd 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:10:57
I really would like to know more about this conversation he had with Bitcoin.

That's a sad reality that the newbies face. I feel sorry for them. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:09:21
Uhmmmmmmmm,.....? You keep telling yourself that
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:14:14
That's all fine and everything. There are a lot of people here in this community. And there will always be the same question asked. What can make this a great community is if we all work together. Don't bash the newbie. Keep scrolling past the question and let someone who might be in a better mood handle it so that the newbie isn't pushed away.

Also, Bloomberg is part of the financial system. They make money on financial news and subscribers subscribing to them about news in the financial industry. Seems pretty part of the financial system to me.

Those are specialized equipment that are made to mine Bitcoin or Ethereum. They can run someone thousands of dollars. And to be profitable you need to spend a lot of money on equipment. For Bitcoin it's easier to just buy Bitcoin from coinbase if you are just starting out. But if you really want to mine then vertcoin or Bitcoin gold are alternative cryptocurrencies that are resistant to asic chips and you can only mine them with graphics cards. Vertcoin is about $7 a coin right now and Bitcoin gold is a little over $200 right now. I own some vertcoin at the moment so I am a bit more biased towards vertcoin. But if you only want Bitcoin, then check out coinbase as you can but Bitcoin like you would a stock. And you don't have to buy a full coin, you can own a portion of a coin. Good luck and welcome to the crypto world.

Who cares. Help the newbies out or just scroll past the post and let someone who is in a better mood answer them. You don't need to get so angry with the newbies. Why get angry? That's so childish.

You will spend too much on electricity to mine with a pi. You need an ASICs to mine these days in order to be profitable. If you want to mine with a pi I would recommend you mine vertcoin or Bitcoin gold. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 04:23:06
But as long as we hold, they get nothing
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:08:18
Even if you cant invest very much you can still make a profit a lot more than having it in a savings account. I have only been buying crypto since this summer and have already made I've 100% profit. So you can turn that $100 into more fairly easy. A lot quicker than in a bank account or stocks.

Lol I think AZ looks the same no matter where you go. This was actually in Chandler.
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:04:51
If you look at the 1 year increase in coinbase of Bitcoin it shows an increase of 1182%. So that is all good and well that you figured the math equation..you started the equation on the wrong numbers. So it's still over 1000% increase. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:48:25
I need my Bitcoin increase fix man. 
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:37:51
Coinbase. And if you know someone with a referral code when you sign up for coinbase you each get $10 worth of Bitcoin when you deposit $100
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:05:20
Me either. Still a good number to get to. 
@_date: 2019-06-02 16:47:51
I was also wondering when I saw it, so thank you.
@_date: 2017-11-24 02:26:09
Sweet. So if I transfer 1btc I will have 1 btc in gdax. Cool beans. 
@_date: 2019-02-08 06:20:02
THIS! This is the sort of thing that wins the internet. Something seemingly small, but in fact is altering the future. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:14:39
Oh gawd no. I tried that. I have never been so bored in my life. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:09:13
Thanks for this. I'll check it out
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:01:52
I like that and I will be hopeful along with you. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:07:03
And I will. I just don't like how they have that kind of control to demand that information. It's a principle thing to me.

Are ya accepting any software engineering internship applications?
