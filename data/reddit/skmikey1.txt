I was amazed to learn that my father and brother were both experts in cryptocurrency when I went to tell them about it.
Did you realize that 'they', presumably Bitcoin Inc., can set the price of Bitcoin at whatever they want? Oh, and 'they' can reprogram it to take all my money at any time. 
Yeah, I thought I had done well educating myself for months on all this, but my dad is a long-haul truck driver so he's heard all about Bitcoin once from Glenn Beck reading an article about it.

There’s a math equation called SHA-256, which takes your input and creates an output in a way that you can’t reverse it. So if all you know is the output, there’s no way to go backwards and find the input.
So put in a random input (a seed) and get out a number x.
Now put number x through the same equation and get a second number y.
Use number y as your public key and keep number x secret. Since there’s no going back from y, only you will know the input which generated it. This secret key can be used to push bitcoin out of an address, while only the public address is needed to push bitcoin in.
So only the seed is random. X depends on the seed and Y depends on X, this is how the private and public key are linked. X and y are not random. They are associated with each other and x(the private key) is used to prove ownership of y (the address).
It’s important that the seed is as random as can be to avoid someone guessing it and deriving your x and with that, stealing your bitcoins in address y.

Holding is investing in bitcoin.
Trading is investing in ones own ability to time the market and bitcoin is just used as a vehicle for this investment because of its large volatility. 
Those two investments are wildly different. Holding through corrections is a better strategy for most, since most lack the skill/knowledge/time to successfully time markets.

I had a low fee tx stuck for ten days before the mempool came down enough to process it, but at that time I was reading that most nodes will discard a tx after 14 days.
Some wallets do support replace by fee and allow you to re-transmit a tx with a higher fee to get it in sooner.

Look at it this way....Roger is performing a service for bitcoin. He’s helping Bitcoin demonstrate its resilience to a specific form of attack, a branding attack.

Last I heard, that 160 million dollars (at that time, probably double or triple that value now) is still locked  in the Parity multi-sig wallets and a hardfork of the network similar to what was done with the DAO hack would be required to recover it.
Such a thing would be much more difficult and risky than the DAO recovery with so much more activity and shitcoins running on the ETH network, which is why nobody wants to do it. Here’s a presentation by Gavin Wood advocating for a hardfork to recover DAO funds...
He’s the developer behind the Parity wallet that suffered the recent freeze, and his company polkadot had some ICO funds frozen inside it. Even he doesn’t seem too keen on hardforking the network to get those back.

The fee is based on the space your transaction uses in the block and what others are currently willing to bid for that space.
The higher bids that built up during the recent period of congestion have all been mined into blocks, so you can get in with a lower bid now.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:52:16
Exactly. If “better” just means cheap transactions for purchasing coffee, then any new coin that comes along can do that.
If “better” means running at scale and designing solutions to permanently implant itself as the internet’s decentralized layer of value transfer, then you got one to choose from.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:10:35
The fee is based on the space your transaction uses in the block and what others are currently willing to bid for that space.
Right now, people are paying about 50 sat/byte to get into the next block. You can check the current clearing fee level here...
I think at the current price, with an average transaction size of ~250 bytes, the fee would be around $1.50.
@_date: 2018-01-02 03:07:29
My 73 sat/byte cleared two days ago after a ten day wait. On the bright side, I wasn’t in a hurry and paid 2-3 bucks when people were paying upwards of a hundred just days prior. Pay with money or pay with time.
Got it to a Nano wallet with a segwit address, happy now.

I had a weird issue with blockchain.info yesterday...a transaction ID showed as confirmed, but clicking through to the receiving address showed no such transaction and balance never updated. An app I use to track the address never updated either.
Blockcypher showed it just fine, though.
When i clicked on Unspent Outputs under Tools, it showed the transaction, just not on the address main page. I sent another transaction, and suddenly the missing transaction appeared.
Just an issue with the blockchain explorer, I guess, by it really freaked me out for a bit.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:14:24
If you search for your address on a site like blockchain.info, you should be able to see the transaction and address that this bitcoin came from.
Good luck, buddy, nice of you to try to do the right thing.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:29:57
What I do to convert is basically estimate average transaction size to be ~250 bytes. If the fee is now 50 sat/byte, then the fee is 12,500 satoshi, this is .000125 btc, and if a bitcoin is currently 12,500 dollars, this comes to about $1.50.

It was, just moving from cold storage to a new Nano. I would have paid more than 2-3 bucks to clear sooner, but I was using breadwallet for years with no problem and this time it estimated a very low fee.

Don’t take advice of people here claiming you should just accept this as yours. If you send that bitcoin on, you’re gonna feel like a real asshole if someone gets in touch later begging for your help. Could be a young fathers life savings or someone’s medical bills they were going to pay.
Check first with any sources you’ve received bitcoin from, whether it’s some business or individual. They may have copy/pasted your address by accident and won’t realize it until they hear from whoever they meant to send it too that it hadn’t arrived.
It’s a large sum of money and I can’t imagine someone would just be okay with it disappearing. If you don’t want to just send it back to the address it came from, I’d just HODL that and if a year from now no one reaches out to you, maybe then keep it.
@_date: 2018-01-07 05:29:50
Yeah, Breadwallet does this. The advice I got was to leave the app closed for a couple weeks so as not to rebroadcast and eventually, the transaction would get rejected.
Instead, the mempool came down and I got confirmed in about two weeks. Breadwallet gives very little control over fees as well, and calculated very low fees, so I’ve got a Nano now.
Good luck.
@_date: 2018-01-06 15:23:37
I’ve never seen anything like this and can’t understand how it would be possible.
Maybe I’m caught in a reorg situation and blockchain.info’s being confused by it?
My understanding of blockchain says this is impossible.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:17:51
It costs the same to move a dollar or a million dollars via bitcoin, because you’re not paying a percent of the coin moved.
You’re effectively buying a chunk of real estate in the block for your transaction to occupy. The price of that real estate is set by the fee market, people bidding for that space.
So it’s a variable fee, but not dependent on transaction amount, just the size (bytes) of the transaction data and what others are willing to pay right now.
@_date: 2018-01-08 00:17:03
Anyone who wants to get rich quick is in altcoins. Nobody buys bitcoin today thinking they’ll 5x or 10x in a month.
The only people holding bitcoin are the people who understand why it’s valuable. Long term thinkers. They see the fees as growing pains any crypto must go through to achieve sustainable scaling solutions.
Alts are in a bubble. That’s where all the hype is, where all the noobs are, where all the dumb money is chasing quick gains.
@_date: 2018-01-21 03:26:35
That is kinda tricky cuz there aren’t a lot of good sites or wallets that do that for ya and fee estimation is a bit of a technical challenge for wallets since it’s a moving target. I now use a ledger nano which has different fee options as well as a manual option. Highly recommend it.
Also, using segwit addresses will save you on transaction fees because they use smaller space in the block. Nano will do this for you, too.

To preserve mining decentralization, the community has sided with keeping the 1 mb block limit. This has led to temporarily increased fees while we wait for layer two solutions like lightning network, greater adoption of segwit addresses, and more off-chain solutions to lighten the load on the blockchain.
It’s a pain in the ass for now, and likely costing bitcoin a good chunk of its market cap in the short term, but in the long run it’s necessary to go through these growing pains. All cryptos will have to go through them at some point if they want to attain or hold any real level of decentralization.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:33:42
The two coins have a different future. The bitcoin paper is titled “peer-to-peer electronic cash”. Bitcoin Cash is focused on maintaining the “cash” use case at all costs, even if it means the network loses its “peer-to-peer” nature as larger and larger computers are required to run a full node.
Bitcoin understands the “peer-to-peer” nature of the network as fundamental to the value proposition of crypto currency. The idea that anyone can run their own node and participate in the ecosystem, verifying the blockchain or validating transactions for themselves. Without sufficient decentralization to resist a takeover, you’re effectively running an overpriced excel spreadsheet and competing with PayPal, which has lower overhead.
I’ve heard bitcoin Cash proponents argue that full nodes don’t matter. Craig Wright literally asked what would be wrong with the worlds top 20 banks running the only nodes (gee, does that sound like bitcoin?) and saying if you don’t have 20K to run a full node, go fuck yourself. Mocking people who want to run a node on Raspberry Pi’s just to help the network perform and validate their own transactions.
People hate Roger not only because he’s profiting off of misleading new people and damaging bitcoin as a brand, but because he needlessly attacks heroes like Andreas Antonopoulos, who have done so much more for bitcoin than Roger has. Roger only cares about Roger.
Edit to add: He’s also taken the open source code of bitcoin written by the core devs he consistently talks down as incompetent, and is using his stripped down version of their creation to make himself seem competent. He just got lucky that he was one of the first people with a pile of cash to stumble onto bitcoin.

I’ve also seen some rumors that coinbase’s wallets contain many millions of small UTXO’s that are uneconomical to move at these fees. Like, they never thought to consolidate into fewer addresses, so now much the btc holdings they do have can’t be moved.
If that’s true, they are really fucked if these fees don’t come down. If they can’t send bitcoin out at customer request, what are they selling but the rights to some bitcoin in the future? And if a run on their btc starts up because people are afraid their bitcoin can’t be sent to their own private keys? Good lord.

I think many people in bitcoin have been spoiled for too long with low fees, they think it can last forever. Every blockchain that wants to grow will eventually have to go through this phase of growth where fees rise and incentivize layer two development. 
Or, you can avoid it by continually increasing the block size and slowly destroying your network by centralizing it. Like a drug, the short term fix feels good,  it long term eats you up.

Leave a decoy paper wallet in a fireproof safe inside your bedroom dresser with some slightly ungodly amount written on it. Then however you encode your real private key, keep it somewhere more innocuous and just as fireproof.

So by your definition of peer, if the top 20 banks were all that could afford to run a node, it would still be a “peer to peer” transaction if I had to bounce my transactions off of Wells Fargo nodes, or Chase nodes, and couldn’t run a node myself. My peers can’t run nodes. We have to rely on third party banks to do our “peer to peer” transactions, instead of running nodes ourselves. Doesn’t make sense to me. Sounds a bit like the system Bitcoin was built to overcome, actually.
And I don’t mind other coins that take Bitcoins code. I’m not critical of litecoin, and I don’t care about Doge. They don’t pretend to be Bitcoin.
And I can’t understand why centralization is such a threat on layer two, but Roger and others completely ignore centralization problems on layer one. Even promote it. It’s because, as Roger would say, they’re either lying or retarded.
@_date: 2017-12-19 18:42:29
To your first paragraph all I can say is no shit, Bcash is a network and doesn’t pretend anything. I was obviously referring to the Bcash community pretending that it is bitcoin, which you admit some do and Roger is one of those. Did you really think I was referring to the code itself? Pointless and willful misunderstands are something I’m used to from Bcash supporters by now, so I’ll just say no shit.
And I don’t know if it’s true that 1 gb blocks would be required to reach the situation promoted by Craig Wright, the example I use above. There are other ways that larger blocks lead to mining and node centralization. 
But we’ll see how it all goes.

Before I had my Nano Ledger, I used paper wallets that I generated at Bitaddress.org. If you’re planning to hold on to your btc for a while, a paper wallet is great. 
Just generate a public/private key pair for yourself and send the bitcoin from your Coinbase account to the public address you generated.
Keep the private key on the paper wallet in a little fireproof safe hidden in your home and you have a pretty safe stash of digital gold. When you need to access it, download a reputable wallet that can utilize the private key or get yourself a Ledger or Trezor wallet to move it to. I used breadwallet back in the day, but haven’t for a year or so. I was happy with it except for the inability to adjust the miners fee myself, which got me stuck in the mempool for a week in early 2018. They may have added this functionality since.
You might want to generate your keys offline (by downloading the bitaddress.org website to a USB device and taking it to an offline computer and printer setup. This can prevent your keys being stolen by malware that searches for these things.

If they bought as much as they could, as fast as possible, the price would soar to unsustainable levels before crashing back down to where the rest of the market would be willing to buy. The purchasing bank will lose a lot of money to this “slippage”.  The same slippage occurs in reverse when a holder dumps a large amount of something on a market. They clear out the order book below and miss out on a lot of money by not slowly selling a large stash over time.
So yes, whales can affect the price temporarily by spiking it up or down, but doing so usually results in a net loss to them as they are either buying above a price the market can sustain or sell below a price the market can sustain.
They can make money doing this, though, by wrecking people who are buying/shorting on margin. It’s called a ‘stop hunt’. If a lot of investors are betting the price will go down by shorting, whales can spike the price up through heir stops, maybe even start a margin cascade in which those shorters are forced to now buy back coin above the market price to close out their position. 
The whales buy a bunch of coin, price spikes up, cascade begins, whales sell into cascade for quick profit, price returns to equilibrium.

From what I recall, a few years back Bitfinex didn’t own Tether as they do now. They turned to using tether when Wells Fargo stopped processing dollar transactions for them. Bitfinex was desperate for a way to keep money flowing in/out and Tether was a solution for their clients.
I didn’t see when Bitfinex bought Tether, but I imagine their business has become so dependent on it that they didn’t want to run the risk of another party running it, so they bought it. 
Bitfinex claims they’re solvent and aren’t running a fractional reserve on Tether, some claim otherwise.
People accept Tether because you can send it easily where the dollar can’t go and be pretty well assured of its value when you sell whatever alt you bought with it.

Murphy’s law - if something can go wrong, it will go wrong.
With hacks and programming errors, this translates to ‘if someone can fuck it up, they will fuck it up’.
We’ve already seen this in the DAO and parity hacks. We’ve seen it with the Segwit2x failure to launch. We’ve seen it in the BTG teams endorsement of a malicious wallet. Small dev teams, weak review, and rushing to deploy code ends up in these situations.
Bitcoin is far less vulnerable to Murphy’s law than any other coin.

Bigger blocks take longer to transmit across the network, and longer to verify, this means it takes longer for other nodes to receive and verify a block before starting on the next one.
During this increased time, whoever found that block already knows it’s legit and gets a head start on the next block. This means more blocks, more bitcoin, goes to the larger miners. This is one method by which larger miners benefit from larger blocks.
Another method is ASICboost, which is neutralized by Segwit. This “exploit” gives ASIC miners using it an energy use advantage over those who don’t, and the technology is protected by patent. Rumor is that Bitmain produces chips capable of it, but have denied using it themselves. This isn’t so much ‘benefitting by larger blocks’ but benefitting from not having segwit.
This is why the BCH miners are both against segwit and for bigger blocks. They have a huge advantage in that system. They are mostly big Chinese miners.

Within coinbase/gdax system, transfers between users wallets are free because the exchange is not sent to the blockchain. You’re right, a transfer is just an update of their own internal ledger.
If you don’t have your private keys, you don’t have your bitcoin. Exchanges like gdax or coinbase hold your bitcoin in their “vault” and allow you to transact in their system without actually moving bitcoin. When you request withdrawal of your bitcoin, they send it on-chain to the address you provide for withdrawal. This is where someone must pay a miners fee. Gdax picks it up, coinbase does not.

As far as I know, the bitcoin developers only change the software after long periods of debate, testing and consensus periods. They don’t alter the software in panicked responses to what other coins are doing, but instead keep a long term view. People say this is a negative, because it leads to periods of growth pains like we see now, where certain attacks have an impact on network functionality. But I believe it’s valuable that the coin is difficult to change, others will be more prone to bugs and developer error. That’s why BCH had to fix their EDA with the DAA, it wasn’t fully thought through or tested. What other changes in the coins future could go wrong when they change it so quickly with so little review?
Other coins will alter their mining algorithms, like Bcash did with its EDA, for the purposes of disrupting the BTC network and making itself more “profitable” for miners by making it basically a giveaway. Not necessarily what is in their coins best long term interest. This is not a good long term value proposition. It’s a short term play and this short term thinking will be a negative to anyone looking to invest large sums. That’s why these coins are valuable mostly to large groups of smalll time speculators as a spot on the crypto roullette wheel and the people pumping the short term cash grab.
The solution is to let bitcoins resiliency show and to not panic. To keep on with development of the lightning network and better software. To keep the value proposition of bitcoin in tact by not altering it in response to what other coins are doing, but what adds value to it.

Communists are so often critical of those who take profit off capital investment because of their belief in labor theory.

What’s the communist justification for keeping the profit here?

A fork is not the original coin, so it’s not creating more bitcoin when a fork occurs. The fork runs on a different network, so even if the code was exactly the same, it has a very different security and network resilience profile than bitcoin, trades in less exchanges, has less infrastructure (wallets, apps and layer two tech) built on top of it, has a smaller pool of developers and greater centralization risk.
You can’t create counterfeit bitcoin, but you can create counterfeit networks. You just need to market them to unwitting buyers as ‘the real bitcoin’ or ‘like bitcoin but better’ or ‘like bitcoin and will be better’.

Looking at a chart of BCHvsBTC makes me think the pattern will continue. Sudden pumps followed by slow bleeds.
And at any time with their small developer base, BCH could run into coding issues similar to what happened with the 2x code. Too little review. Not to mention that the long term roadmap (if they stay true to their “vision”) doesn’t scale. They won’t have enough devs to match BTC’s advancement. They may go faster in upgrading their code, but that is not a plus.
They’re dreamers if they think every single transaction on the planet from coffee to cars will or needs to be on-chain.
And institutional investors coming in are going into BTC, not BCH. They know where the long term value is.
Bitcoin Cash is a cash grab. It’s a lure for people who want cheap, fast transactions and don’t realize that the space is already flooded with coins offering that same thing for less. It’s an easy thing to offer when you’re not running at scale. Any coin can literally do it. Those buying BCH are being sold the idea that so many alts promise, “bitcoin but better”.
So you probably see which side I fall on as to which coin has real value and which doesn’t.

You actually get ten bitcoin diamond for every bitcoin, but I get what your saying.
These are only experimental ways to create and distribute altcoins. Each fork will yield diminishing returns and be scammier and more poorly programmed or thought out than what came before. Before long, I suspect exchanges will stop listing them as attempts to lure their customers into a scam.
Bitcoin Cash is a pump and dump cash grab that’s only lasted for the marketing and monetary support by big players in the industry. Despite coding issues regarding the difficulty adjustment and ‘anyone can spend’ addresses being robbed due to segwit code being removed, it’s been able to grow because of a small group of moneyed backers. I was able to increase my btc holdings 20%.
Bitcoin gold is already a shitshow of developers promoting malware wallets stealing private keys, shady code kicking back coins to dev wallets, and now the main client download was hacked and replaced with a malicious wallet software. I was able to increase my btc holdings 5%.

I agree and I worry that people excited for the ‘free money’ that comes with splits, calling them ‘cryptodividends’ as though they are a good thing, will only damage the network if this continues.
Bcash only rose because of a massive propaganda effort and some unknown miner supplying almost 10% of bitcoins hashpower even when it is less profitable to mine.
Without those two, the media and hardware support, bcash wouldn’t be limping along as it is. To get people to buy it, you need to convince them it is or will be ‘better than bitcoin’

If your bitcoin is in a paper wallet, you are prepared. 
After the fork, if you want to access your forked coins, I would advise that you first migrate your btc to a brand new address. Save the old addresses, of course, to use on the new chain but first ensure that your btc is safe.
To access your forked coins, you will have to find and download a wallet which can interact with that chain. This is the iffy part, cuz you most likely don’t know who made this wallet or what it’s really doing with your private keys. It was probably made in haste and not well-tested, it may even be malicious and steal your coins.
In the previous fork, I moved my btc to a safe address, then used the electron cash wallet to access my BCH. First tested the software by sending a small amount of BCH to an exchange (I used Bittrex), and when I saw it arrive, I quickly moved the rest of my BCH to the exchange. If by quickly, we mean waiting a full day for six confirmations.
Now, these upcoming forks may not have adequate replay protection. Another reason to send your BTC first to an address you control. If the transaction is replayed on the other chain, you will still have the private keys to those coins.
The important thing is to always protect your bitcoin by moving it from the address associated with the private key you will be using to access your forked coins. I emphasize this because I’m anticipating future forks designed to confuse newbies anxious to get their ‘free money’. I was surprised electron cash wallet worked for me, but I hope this all helps.

I had a choice to sell my BTC for tokens on a chain promising big blocks and low fees....
Or sell my BCH and use the proceeds to pay transaction fees on the more secure, robust BTC network for years to come.
Thanks BCH!

Thank you, sir. I'll pass this along with the rest.

If it goes under a hundred, that's when I'll really have to eat crow for how much I've been selling her on it. She's understanding, and we can afford to lose what I've spent, but of course, I'd rather not break that news to her.

You’re a victim of government malfeasance? I mean...how many people could actually use a currency not controlled by incompetent criminals, amirite? 
@_date: 2015-04-27 19:54:55
It is, especially as tmornini explains above. I'm just new to using Bitcoin, and have never sent money overseas before, so it was a new experience for me.
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:46:39
Thank you very much, sir. :)

I believe Blockchain.com is legit. I've used their iOS app with no problems in the past, though I prefer breadwallet.

Thanks. If he has trouble converting his BTC the next few days, I'll see if this helps. 
@_date: 2015-04-27 16:41:41
He says he found 'shops' in his area that accept it. Whether he'll buy something with BTC directly, or exchange the private key for currency with the vendor, I'm unsure. Will ask him for an update in a couple days.
@_date: 2015-04-27 15:35:04
Thanks for the insight. Still using old language to describe a new situation. :) 
@_date: 2015-04-27 18:21:34
Want to thank everyone for their responses. Also, not asking for more tips, but wanted to say I'm passing along the 10.50 tipped here to my buddy.
Thanks guys.

I'll ask him for an update in a couple days. When I first asked if he could use some Bitcoin, he replied that he doesn't have PayPal (in his country?) so he couldn't use it. His English leaves me confused at times, but it sounded as though PayPal doesn't operate in Nepal and he thought you needed PayPal to use Bitcoin.
He also described Bitcoin as 'internet money you can buy drugs with'. That's all he'd heard of it. I informed him that if anyone around him used Bitcoin, he could sell the private key to them for local currency. The next day, he messaged me that he'd searched Google (either for info on Bitcoin, or seeking local vendors, unclear), but had found some 'shops' that accept Bitcoin.
So far that's all I know, but I'll try to get back to you with how he actually uses it.

Told my Facebook friends that Evolution was a fraud. No one knew what the hell I was talking about.

Why are quantum physicists so bad in bed?
When they finally find a position, they lose their momentum. And when they finally get their momentum, they can't find a position.

Two months ago, we hit 2700 and plunged to 1800.
2 weeks later, we'd climbed up to 3,000. 
5 weeks later, we're here at 1,900. 
I'm still hodling.

When those people come to buy, we all just wait until 14K to sell. What’s so hard about this?
@_date: 2018-12-25 05:19:09
I leave room for the possibility that some code exploit or unforeseen issue with incentive structure of crypto arises which can’t be addressed quickly enough. Maybe quantum computing does secure hash encryption in...I don’t know.
I don’t think btc will ever be zero, but destroying bitcoin, or actually exposing it as unworkable and therefore worthless would make someone a lot of money if they just shorted the hell out of it before announcing some unique solution to this rubix cube that causes the whole space to implode.
@_date: 2019-05-24 11:41:24
So hard to explain to my friends the value of Hodling. Most have lost all their bankroll trying to sell the top and avoid short term dips.
If you’re trading in and out at what you think are the lows and highs, then you’re not investing in bitcoin, you’re betting on your abilities as a market analyst.
If you are not a market analyst, then you will eventually lose that bet.

Logically speaking, any currently undiscovered problem with anything could not have been discovered in the past.
@_date: 2018-12-25 07:11:26
I’m talking about a possible, inherent, unseen flaw with the concepts, social structures, economics, or coding common to all crypto. That’s the only thing that could drive it to zero, because no fork could address the problem and no alt could take up the mantle.

My wife, “You’re buying more? You said it would go up, why are you buying more?”
Me, “Because this sale won’t last.”

Then they call for a rollback of the blockchain.
Then you laugh at them.
