How does a miner 'choose' what to award themselves???
I've never mined (or really looked into it). I was under the assumption that the reward payout was automatic or something along those lines.
@_date: 2019-07-10 20:01:25
Thanks for the detailed reply!
So the halving that will happen is basically just pre-agreed on? But in theory if somehow everyone agreed, it could just not happen?

Does this friend happen to hold any traditional investments? Or frankly have any fiat currency? 
Because in theory he's very correct, but this is possible with just about all investments, and frankly through different means, the dollar could crash too, so his fear in it happening to bitcoin seems to just be based on lack of familiarity (which frankly we all have since this stuff is still so new) 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:24:15
I'm not even talking about not knowing about the law. Crypto is so new that unless it's so well defined in the law, you could honestly not think that it's included in their definition. 
It's the use of the word 'intentionally' that throws me, because it's almost implying that you're wrong, ignorance is a defense. And that it's only illegal if they can prove you did it..intentionally. As in you knew you were lying and you had a reason to lie.

Posts like this make the think 'are you really a millionaire if you have absolutely no intention of selling?' Like it sounds like you're just prepared for the switch to a full crypto world, in which case referencing the conversion to dollars is irrelevant. idk... anyone think this some times?
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:55:16
I think the people saying it will reach $1mil are saying that it will be mainstream across the world for that to happen, and if that were the case, $15trillion in crypto isn't crazy.

@_date: 2017-12-02 01:04:02
How are they going to prove you 'intentionally' hid it?
If my understanding of 'financial institutions' doesn't include crypto currency, even if they asked if I had any other accounts I wouldn't think to include my crypto because I don't see it as an account or an institution. So even if they saw it as hiding, it's not intentional. Unless they are extremely specific I don't see how you could begin to enforce this without it being a pick and choose situation.

This is what I've been thinking! I understand it's because the IRS is trying to label it as an asset, but how the fuck can they do that? It's call cryptoCURRENCY, it shouldn't be hard to label it correctly. How are you not going to treat it like every currency?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:56:49
While you're right that bitcoin is a random string of characters, it is backed by something: a large group of people spread around the world agreeing that it has value. Every fiat currency is exactly the same. 
Side note, I believe USD is only backed by the federal reserve in the sense that they control supply, and demand that it is the legal form of tender. I don't believe any country can control the currency's value globally. But I think that's totally different from what we're talking about.

Do you actually believe this? Not trying to attack your opinion at all, but I am curious. Do you think real estate is really like the ultimate goal for crypto? Like more so than if we figured out the whole 'buying a coffee' idea? 
@_date: 2018-05-08 17:49:21
Do they actually believe this shit, or do they just say it? It's so factually incorrect it's just sad. 
Like how do you go from working on a hard fork to saying you were around before the coin you forked from? What fucking reality is that? 
@_date: 2018-05-08 18:52:00
I think it's hard to understand because much of what you said is just incorrect to the facts. (I know you're just explaining their position and not yours. Not attacking you, but those bcashers.)


You can be the closest to the white paper, but if your coin wasn't created at the beginning then you literally were not there at the beginning. There's no two ways about it. 


Personally I think this argument is dumb af. Sure the majority of BTC money is used as a store of value, but that's the same case with fiat... Also, people are straight up using btc to buy things. Are there quicker options, sure, but just saying people don't use btc to buy things is just wrong.

@_date: 2018-10-05 17:33:14
The amount doesn't matter. Losing 90% of your investment is still losing 90% of your investment. Maybe to you losing $28 is nothing, to someone else that could have been everything. 
Percentage is most definitely more meaningful than the amount in context.
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:04:08
If you're living paycheck to paycheck and $28 is literally all you have at the moment to set aside, that is a big deal. 
But my main point (which I don't think I made clear) is that the $28 figure is meaningless. It tells me nothing about how much someone has lost since it tells me nothing about how much stake they have. The percentage gives me a much better picture. Because you're right, the $28 figure isn't much. I don't think Charlie is trying to say "if you can't stand to lose $28, crypto isn't for you". He's focusing on the percentage because like I said:


@_date: 2018-10-05 19:25:00
People always reply with "the timing is suspicious" but like do they actually think he controls the LTC market and he basically did a huge pump &amp; dump that just so happened to be inline with the negative performance of the whole market and every single dam coin out there?? Honestly if he is that good, I want him in charge forever because he's a goddamn magician then.
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:39:45
Yeah he straight up warned people that the growth wasn't sustainable (shocker!!) and had been saying he didn't want to look like he had a financial reason to promote LTC. It totally makes sense to me why he sold, and at the time he did. Why would he wait to sell at a lower price??
@_date: 2018-10-05 17:59:29
I think the last line is more in line with what I meant:


Of course amount *does* matter but not as much as percentage. Amount would only be more beneficial is everyone could only buy one. No more, no less. Then it would be an 'even playing field', if you will, in regards to profit/loss.
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:22:04
I agree with 


But your point of 2.8 million vs 28 is very easily debatable. I'm positive Bill Gates doesn't bat an eye if he wakes up with a loss of 2.8mil. Yet I know multiple people who would absolutely worry over losing $28. 
You're extremely right factors come into play. 
@_date: 2018-10-05 20:20:20
I provide you with a legit example that even you admit shows your previous statement is wrong... and I'm the one thats a dumb fuck??? Alright man, that *totally* makes sense. Have fun with your mental gymnastics!!
@_date: 2018-10-05 18:57:11
Wtf are you talking about dude?? That doesn't make any sense...
If I ask someone "hows \*insert investment\* doing" If they say "it's down $50", my immediate question is "what percentage is that?". If they had said "it's down 5%" we'd move on with the conversation. It being down $50 tells me nothing about his own investment.

The average person doesn't hate bitcoin. They don't know much about it, don't have an opinion, and don't see a need to educate themselves on it. With a lack of info, it's easy to see it as unnecessary. But the average person most definitely doesn't *hate* bitcoin. That's mildly absurd.


Well... no... none of that is that black and white... As a millennial, I've seen my wage steadily increase as time has gone on and I've developed in my career. And I have no debt. And no many people who have no debt. I also know many people in debt, and most of them have a timeline of when it will be paid off, even if that be 10+ years. There's nothing in the financial system that put these people in debt or are holding them there either...

If I read your post right, the only thing you offer to back up your opinion besides "It's all gambling addicts and people who want a lambo hopped up on hopium", is :


Which is absurd because no one thinks it's going to be overnight, and yes, trillions of dollars could very easily be converted to btc OVER TIME.
I'm honestly not sure you make a better argument at all than the people saying "because of math". It seems like you're confusingly linking "the scene" with the actual potential performance of btc in the future...
@_date: 2019-10-10 15:02:28
This is dumb. Do you actually think people are going to be swayed into buying or looking into BTC because of a profile photo...on a comment on youtube...????

I'm not sure that there's another statement that so clearly shows what country you're from...
To say "not everyone can have free healthcare" when MANY countries have exactly that, is honestly just fucking dumb. And using the excuse "it costs money"?? Come on man! That's just comically stupid.
@_date: 2019-10-10 21:41:00
I'm assuming then that you wear a BTC shirt every day , with BTC pants, and BTC socks with a BTC hat and BTC jacket?? Why don't you have BTC ear rings yet? Why stop there!! The impact of a BTC face tattoo will have "massive downstream effects"!!! It's all about "the smallest thing"!!!! We should start shouting BUY BTC at the top of every hour!! THINK OF THE BUTTERFLY EFFECT!!!!
It's amazing to me that people are so clueless to not do this!!! 
I'm glad I found someone such as yourself that agrees with me.
@_date: 2019-08-06 21:07:54
You didn't really make a point... especially not one that is at all tied to your first comment. So since 'free healthcare' won't pay for literally unnecessary procedures... what?? what's your point??? We just shouldn't try to have 'free healthcare'?? No one is expecting or asking for those type of procedures to be included. BASIC HEALTHCARE is all people want.
And how does that have anything to do with: 


@_date: 2019-06-26 20:50:15


But...that's not what you said...that's a completely different thing.


So do you think many people bought at that point or not a lot of people bought at that point?? You're saying contradictory things...
@_date: 2019-06-26 21:18:05
....and?? What do you have to back up that Fidelity is buying **massive** amounts of btc? Or that either of the others are? Fidelity has mentioned that they are rolling out btc trading for institutional customers, but again, what evidence do we have that they have started, and that the extent of it is enough to massively move the whole fucking btc market?
Also, that's only 3 entities, 2 of which are brand fucking new. Do you actually think they have enough purchasing power to drastically move an asset with a market cap of $200+ billion???

I agree he shouldn't take my word for it. I was just trying to pass along certain information I've heard so he can make the best call for himself. I imagine the people who aren't making much return at all are using regular desktop PC's rather than one designed for mining which definitely saves power use.
@_date: 2017-11-15 00:47:56
Yeah. Is that always recommended? (I'm new to this) it just sounds like you could make more sooner on the market rather than waiting a year or two to finally mine enough to make a profit.
@_date: 2017-11-16 22:11:05
I get what you're getting at, but isn't that the case now? Where a dollar can buy more or less from day to day (more like month to month if anything). Wouldn't the main difference be that Bitcoin is just more volatile?

I can't answer a few of your questions, but to  you kinda answered your own question. If the goal is to have Bitcoin be the dominant currency, you student debt wouldn't go up, it would remain the same in Bitcoin. It's the same as it is now, as in, you're $75,000 in student debt, which might be $1m Yen today, and maybe $1.5m tomorrow, but to you it's only $75,000 because you only deal in dollars. It would be the same if you only dealt in Bitcoin.

I'm not really sure what you're saying... Yeah Nationalism in theory stems from Patriotism, but is very very clearly separated from Patriotism (please see both definitions I've posted), and frankly your or my opinion on that doesn't change a thing since words are defined by societies not individuals.
@_date: 2018-04-13 21:05:46
Wait... do you think I just came up with those definitions? That's how they're defined in the English language...
You're right, they are similar, and it's easy and common to confuse the two, but I don't know how to answer your last question without just copy-and-pasting the definitions again. Maybe I can in this way: Patriotism is thinking your country is great and wanted others to enjoy it as well, Nationalism is thinking that you wave a superiority over other countries.
@_date: 2018-04-14 01:36:49
I don't think I was trying to negate that point. He offered an opinion as an atheist, and I gave mine which is a bit opposing. Really the main point that I was trying make is that patriotism and nationalism are not the same, really thats it. Wasn't trying to argue about anything. Seemed like the person I responded to was using them interchangeably.
And I fully agree with your second line.
@_date: 2018-04-13 16:36:06
As another atheist, wtf are you talking about dude? You either don't understand what a religion is, or don't understand what patriotism is. I feel confident in the latter for sure, because there is a huge difference between patriotism and nationalism...

Patriotism is fundamental to liberty because pride in one’s nation-state, and a willingness to defend it if necessary, is the basis of national independence. Patriotism is the courage of national self-determination.
By contrast, nationalism is patriotism transformed into a sentiment of superiority and aggression toward other countries. Nationalism is the poisonous idea that one’s country is superior to somebody else’s. Nationalism is intrinsically a cause of war and imperialism.

If you can't see that that comment is pure shilling (even if you're intentions are good) than you're blind as hell.

Who the hell is that guy in the image at the top? Did they just decide that Satoshi is a middle aged Japanese man?! Am I the only one who thinks that mad fucked up, and at least a little racist?

I'm confused. You could have easily found out your withdrawal limit before transferring BTC to coinbase.
Also, pretty much by the definition your BTC is not held hostage... You simply have a withdrawal limit. That in no way is equal to them not allowing you ANY access to your money for an unspecified time.
I can't see a way how Coinbase could be responsible for any of your issues that you easily could have avoided. Obviously there are things that make Coinbase not the best thing ever, but this is all on you.

Definitely, but that's a situation he put himself in, not coinbase. It's not like they changed their terms on him (or are even holding his funds hostage like he claims).
