I Don't think classic is as prominent as BCH/BTC so it's not as recognised?

Failed to release the maximum value yes. lost one million - no you never had it. you had x shares, x coins that never changed. to "loose" one million you would need one million to loose. not a theoretical valuation that only matters once cashed out the initial unit you bought into. to address;
"oh well you didn't lose anything, just imaginary money" 
You would have lost the $1000 you bought initially and upto 999,000$ in potential value. you would not have lost 1 million though.

They never lost $40,000 they're still speculatively up $17,760.
They could have speculatively lost 40k but until it's cashed out the only real loss is the $90 initial...

Well it kinda is.. if your measuring in USD.. its only valid once cashed out.. that's when it becomes a measurable loss/gain.
You can only loose money when you cashout below what you bought in, the peaks and gain were never yours till you cashed out.
For example if BTC was 20k next week and everyone dumped that "20k x 3btc" isn't worth that worth 60k... the price will fall and fall. 
Only counts when you sell it the rest is pure speculation on what yo can sell it for...

I think you're analogies are dumb tbh!
you would have gold bars stolen, not theoretical. however the value is just an estimate until sold you would have lost what you put in.
House analogy is massively flawed, you still only paid $100,000 you don't gain till you cash in the rest is all speculative. If it was only a $100k house and it's not worth 1M$ I'm sure the land alone would still have over 100k :)
