Plenty of things you can buy with BTC, just send your money out of coinbase to the seller and buy what you need and resell that.

So myself and other's watch a couple UFC events a year and we're a *meathead*? , It's not likely I'll offer to sponsor anything your affiliated with if you think its only *meatheads* who watch UFC and somehow they have no "ability to make Bitcoin easier to use"
 I guess you have still have a lot to learn in life and as they say "Don't judge a book by its cover"
You're an absolute idiot to put everybody who watch's UFC into one class(meathead's) and then in your next breath your claiming "We need to emphasize development to the people who have the ability to make Bitcoin easier to use"
For all you know many highly talented developers are UFC fans but why would they want to have anything to do with someone like you that is immature and has to resort to calling them *meathead's*
Good luck and I sure hope your not the one looking for sponsors, with your attitude it'll fail miserably and many dev's would look at you as "that guy demanding help and features for something but can't code a line or contribute himself"

Sorta dislike the use the classic "Dark Side of the moon" album cover by Pink Floyd as their own and simply flip it upside down.
No reason to associate Pink Floyd with them, maybe use Justin Beiber's album cover instead if you want to be disrespectful

In 1995 I recall modem speeds of 14.4k and then the doubling of speed to 28.8k...oh my what speed!! haha.
In 1995 at least in my Canadian city I do not recall Cyber Cafes and this was likely due to speed etc...it was around 1998 that they had a few open and most were using them for gaming from what I recall.
Around 1997/98 I recall helping beta test 1mbit speeds through the local cable company, they were the fastest at the time and 1mbit download and 128k upload cost me about $130 a month.
Being banned from the Internet in 1995 wouldn't have been too bad, you would at least not have to suffer through endless animations, site counters and the dreaded &lt;blink&gt; tag.
I still can't believe how popular site counters were back then :-)

Thanks for the info guys and I won't even attempt mining if this machine sucks that bad, thought I might be able to get lucky and use the cycles while I'm sleeping or away but I guess not.

I wish you a good fight, hope you don't need a mortgage or anything.

Making 100 BTC over 3 years is pretty crappy and then when you say  reality is 55 BTC&lt;&lt;huge laugh&gt;&gt;   I'm glad I haven't bought into this. It seems at this time your only option to *maybe* make money is with an Avalon?
