The market price is very volatile and depends a lot on hype and news. The creation of Bitcoin will have somewhat a fixed price as it is independent of hype.

McAfee recently said it's around 1000$.
Was this anywhere close?
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:54:47
But difficulty adjustments aren't as volatile as price.
@_date: 2017-09-19 16:40:06
No calculations done by the community so far?
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:03:44
That makes sense.
@_date: 2017-05-08 09:04:29
Sure. You are entitled to your opinions. Maybe there are other people here who are more open to discussions and can speak the truth.
@_date: 2017-05-09 06:59:20
But again you are trusting that they will not send your private keys to the internet.
@_date: 2017-05-09 05:09:23
Store of value is a use case I agree on. I was talking about buying general purpose things with BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:31:41
Why do they prefer it over current systems? I mean I get that in Venezuela there is a lot of inflation and people would want to store their wealth in something out of govt control. But why in USA?
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:06:27
I completely agree. I am just saying that all these situations would arise if either I am doing something illegal (not saying illegal is wrong as the govt can have unreasonable policies) or if I live in a hyper-inflated nation.
It doesn't apply to buying general daily life stuff in other nations.
@_date: 2017-05-08 09:53:45
Why does it trouble you so much to see other people discuss things openly and truthfully? Maybe because it is against your work of fooling people into your beliefs. Let this be a fair discussion. Reddit is an open community and all of us here have free will.
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:32:02
I would like to be corrected. But in my opinion the application needs your private key to sign transactions. And once it has it, it's only a matter of trust that they will not use it.
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:03:34
With lack of adoption, how can it still be a good investment product?
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:08:22
Like it :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 05:08:33
Can you elaborate on that please?
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:26:25
So what in your opinion on the major proportion of users currently?
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:07:49
That's a fair point. A lot of people buy jewellery for store of value. And that is a use case of it. I would be happy to hear experiences of people using BTC as a value store.
@_date: 2017-05-08 10:23:56
C'mon man. Don't you hear all the news about BTC being used to buy drugs on dark nets or for ransomwares?
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:02:51
Yes, it is not impossible. But if you are moving money out of country, would you want to go through AML/KYC checks?
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:31:42
As far as I know, local Bitcoins has a limit on btc transaction and they require verification too.
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:05:11
Great. Why did you prefer to buy it with BTC?
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:38:01
I understand your concern. If a nation is in debt, then they will print more money which will in turn cause inflation and cause the value of the currency to go down. For safety of an individual's wealth it makes sense for them to convert the local currency to something more stable (eg. precious metals, foreign currency, cryptocurrency). 
In case if the govt restricts buying precious metals/foreign currency, BTC can serve the purpose as it is not in control of the govt. 
Have citizens of any country adopted BTC for this purpose yet?
@_date: 2017-05-08 08:57:17
I am sorry? Please check my reddit history and if that suggests I am from some gov agency, then feel free to not comment. However I just wanted to understand the impact btc is having on the world.
@_date: 2017-05-08 10:27:02
You can buy a drink with BTC. But my point is the main adoption points for BTC. Obviously it wasn't invented to buy drinks off your local pub.
I agree that all of these activities have been going on much before BTC and will continue to happen no matter what. Cash is used for all these purposes, that doesn't make cash a bad thing. I am only saying that the major initial adoption for BTC is in the areas I mentioned. And I would like to know where do other people see massive user adoption happening.
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:27:11
If that kind of security is a concern, then you will be running your own BTC node. Otherwise wallets can do the same thing. Ang=d how feasible is it for common people to use own nodes?
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:04:08


How are you so sure of this?
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:15:57
Yes transactions are created by a private key which is known to the app. The app broadcasts the transaction in such a way that the private key is not broadcasted. But still you are trusting that they don't broadcast it.
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:15:22
But for everyday usage when we are comparing to credit card, customers will have to use wallets where the same security concern arises again.
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:33:22
But if someone is in debt, then someone other has money. Hasn't the world always been like this?
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:46:32
You really need anonymity for buying remote services?
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:23:49
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:44:05
I agree with store of value and anonymous P2P transactions. But how is speculation a use?
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:31:18
I get your point :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:04:41
With Mycelium you are trusting that they do not share your information.
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:08:05
If that is the advantage one is looking for.
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:29:14
And how does paying with BTC make a difference for these services?
@_date: 2017-05-09 09:14:43
Are you from Indonesia? I actually wanted to talk to someone who has seen the situation first hand? Is using BTC helping people there?
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:31:28
Ok. The goal can be to buy ALL things with bitcoin. But why do it? If illegal markets find a use for it, let it be. Legal markets already have a lot of payment systems which are fast, cheap and work perfectly.
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:17:02
So, there has been no warnings to people using bitcoin? Here in India we have had a warning from our reserve bank.
@_date: 2017-05-08 10:36:12
No one is confessing their sins. We are just discussing the potential uses of BTC (be it legal or illegal). That way we can make a more informed decision.
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:42:57
I don't think that's correct. If you are using a wallet to send transactions, they can steal your private keys and funds.
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:27:57
If that kind of security is a concern, then you will be running your own BTC node. Otherwise wallets can do the same thing. And how feasible is it for common people to use own nodes?
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:45:23
Can't this be done with BTC as well? Stealing your private keys by a wallet service? Or do you suggest everyone uses their private node?
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:19:09
Yes. There are multiple other factors which I am not denying. I am only trying to find areas where Bitcoin provides 10x value than traditional systems.
@_date: 2017-05-08 10:35:16
Yep. Can you give some example of such economies?
Also, do you have any comments on the points I mentioned in the post?
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:39:50
Makes sense. Right now the speculators/investors use it more often than any of the other segments, but do you see a future where some other segment will be using it more?
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:50:50
But if BTC adoption doesn't increase (actual non speculative usage) in the coming years, wouldn't the investment returns start to hurt? And people will move away.
@_date: 2017-05-08 11:44:27
Are there any evidences that the world is verge of a major economic collapse?
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:07:18
I am concerned about my financial privacy. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:01:56
I get your point. Actually here in India as well, gambling is illegal and I have seen friends looking for other options of payment.
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:36:30
Haha. But why EVERYTHING? Why not only certain things (like the ones I mentioned in the post) which are suited for BTC. For everything else we have Mastercard :)
@_date: 2017-05-09 10:48:35
Oh. So Bitcoin is actually being used by someone as a store of value then. What is govt stance? Are they aware of what citizens are doing?  
@_date: 2017-05-08 09:05:24
And why so? Why should I blind myself to the usage in grey areas? As a community, it's our responsibility to discuss all issues truthfully.
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:27:36
Doesn't this already happen with our payment systems? I mean the merchant receives a confirmation and then only the transfer of goods happen.
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:06:36
What is your motivation behind using BTC for buying general use items? I mean it makes sense if someone is living in a hyper-inflated economy and wants to store wealth. But does it make sense for other people?
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:32:35
Yes that is possible but how many people do that?
@_date: 2017-05-08 10:37:55
Yes, so whatever in your opinion will be the major contributor to BTC adoption, you can point that here.
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:30:48
Yes I agree. But isn't first converting money to BTC a headache given exchanges KYC/AML requirements?
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:47:25
The gambling part. Thanks btw. I am just tired of vague statements by the community and wants to see the main points for actual adoption.
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:33:39
To make transactions, they need your private key to sign it. They have your information.
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:09:59
I am not sure if I personally fully appreciate this yet. I mean I have never had any problems with the traditional payment system yet for buying general purpose things.
Only if were living in an economy where inflation was like 100% it would make sense for me to buy/sell general purpose stuff using BTC.
@_date: 2017-05-08 12:54:55
This is my first and last reply to a spammer like you. Would be better to engage in some meaningful conversations.
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:59:39
And what advantages do you get for buying these stuff with BTC?
@_date: 2017-05-09 05:01:23
Might be. But I live in India and people here are not that privacy conscious yet.
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:03:32
Why didn't you use a traditional payment system?
@_date: 2017-05-08 15:34:44
Paper done, as in?
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:28:05
If that kind of security is a concern, then you will be running your own BTC node. Otherwise wallets can do the same thing. And how feasible is it for common people to use own nodes?
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:34:05
But given the AML/KYC regulations, wouldn't first converting cash to BTC be a big headache?
@_date: 2017-05-09 14:16:20
But would he/she trust me and where will he/she get that amount of bitcoins?
@_date: 2017-05-08 11:43:19
Oh, is it? Can you point me to some resources on the internet?
@_date: 2017-05-09 03:22:30
Actually yes, I never thought of it this way. I mean I knew that people in hyper-inflated economies (be it first world or third world) would want to store their wealth in something which is stable (precious metals). This can also be done using BTC in case the govt is not very restrictive with people holding gold or foreign currency. 
But I always thought that the wealthy people or the people who are trying to cheat the system would be doing that. But in reality anyone (however small the wealth may be) would want to do such thing when the govt policies are not enough to secure their wealth (as in hyper-inflated economies)
Do you have any data if BTC has already being used actively in any of such countries?
@_date: 2017-05-09 07:00:31
Oh. Ok. So you mean people legally sending money across international borders. Yes makes sense. Which are the leading companies? And user adoption?
@_date: 2017-07-21 07:38:32
So when does BIP 148 come into effect (if it does)?
