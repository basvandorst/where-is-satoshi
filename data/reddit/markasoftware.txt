Nope. Although Eclair "core" and the desktop GUI are open source, I don't think the Android app is, so unfortunately it cannot be forked for mainnet support. You could always run a node in Termux, but at that point why even bother.

It's truly unbelievable how many people who have never used it think of Bitcoin as this nebulous amazing currency, yet they couldn't guess that it's divisible. Why would it be touted as such a revolution if it could only be transferred in $10k chunks?

So this was Acinq's plan all along -- introduce themselves as a middleman for the sake of profit.
If you are a business who wants to accept LN payments, don't do this. Instead, keep watch on [BTCPay]( a self-hosted payment gateway. The next major version should have full LN support.
That being said, it's better to accept LN through a middleman than not at all.

This is important. Here's how to use SegWit with Electrum, for desktop users: 
If you're on mobile, use GreenBits.
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:48:36
There are a few solutions:
1. Only send money using your channel. If you only send money, then nobody would want to broadcast an older version, as that would give you *more* than you're supposed to have! And if it somehow does go through, oh well, you have more money now!
2. Come online every few days to check for bad transactions. If somebody broadcasts an old transaction, there is a certain amount of time (I think it's configurable?) before the channel actually closes. You can broadcast the "anti-cheat" transaction any time before the channel is fully closed. So, if you set it to, say, one week, then if somebody broadcasts a malicious transaction, you can broadcast the anti-cheat one if you come online the next day.
3. delegate it to a trusted third party, they can broadcast the anti-cheat transactions for you. You don't have to give them access to the private keys.
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:43:38
Some confident people are already running it on mainnet. It'll be a gradual thing. However, I'd say at least lnd and probably eclair will become "stable" at some point this year, which is the closest we'll get to an "official" release.
@_date: 2018-01-04 17:48:02
If segwit was required, it would invalidate non segwit transactions made long ago. For example, what if you had an address, created a time locked transaction to send the money to a wallet you control in 2 years, then delete the private keys? (A "hodl" transaction)? Hardforking for segwit would break that. Breaking old transactions is not a good precedent to set.

No, just an error message. Your wallet either supports it or it doesn't.
@_date: 2018-01-03 21:33:10
You can send to bech32 from any supported wallet. Some wallets, like Core, support sending to a bech32 address from a "1" address (p2pkh). Electrum makes it more difficult to do these backward addresses because bech32 is ever so slightly more space efficient, for even lower fees/better scalability. IMO they made the wrong decision. What you can do is just help spread the word about how to do the backwards compatible addresses and use it yourself.

Nice, you are learning about how BTC works rather than just dreaming about lambos. And that's probably a pretty good book to learn from. However, that still doesn't change the fact that even if korypostma was referring to the coinbase in the block header (which i think he was), what he was talking about is still not how solo mining works. Solo mining involves no pool, yet he was talking about it as if it did.
@_date: 2018-01-10 23:08:10
I tried c-lightning, and it seems the simplest and easiest to setup one. But after going offline, then coming online again, I cannot figure out how to reconnect to nodes I have channels with. It just says OFFLINE, and attempting to connect to them again as a new node causes the daemon to crash. Eclair, for example, reconnects automatically every time you start it. Is this a known issue?

GIMP may be lacking, but Blender is really pretty close to professional programs in terms of 3d modeling. It can be lacking a bit in its other features, like compositing, motion tracking, video editing, but it is highly competitive with paid programs in terms of modeling and animation.

@_date: 2018-01-29 23:42:04
It's not because of different nonces; even if you have the same nonce, but a different coinbase transaction (one that goes to you instead of the pool), that causes the merkle root to be different, which in turn causes the whole block header to be different, resulting in a different block hash which will most likely not meet the difficulty target.

SegWit is backwards compatible. You can send money to anywhere, even exchanges and wallets that do not support SegWit yet, from a SegWit wallet.
@_date: 2018-01-03 05:44:49
You connect to one or two nodes manually, maybe with a DNS seed or hardcoded nodes (this is how Bitcoin Core does discovery as well), then those nodes tell you about other nodes until you know about most of the network, including which nodes have channels with which. Then you route locally.

The fact that this is downvoted shows how shit this, and ever other crypto sub, has become. Since when is BTC an investment more than a world changing financial system? If you buy BTC only as an investment, really, fuck you, you are the reason everything's about to go to shit and are the main reason BTC might fail.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:32:36
They should go down in the future, but it's hard to tell when. SegWit is in place, and as more companies and wallets adopt it, the blocksize should slowly increase towards 2mb; currently it's at about 1.1mb, so there's room to grow. Hopefully, by the time we start to reach that ~2mb limit, the Lightning Network will be ready for production use. As merchants begin to accept LN payments, fees will drop drastically both on and off chain as most small transactions move to LN.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:28:09
Coinbase is the easiest, learn how to transfer to GDAX so you can pay lower fees. You could also use Changelly to directly buy crypto delivered to your wallet, but then you'll have to pay the tx fee every time you buy, so you'd have to use alts for that. 
I wouldn't recommend Jaxx, it's not released under a suitable open source license and is therefore almost impossible to audit. There's no way to determine whether it's secure or not, and they don't have a good track record. I'd recommend greenaddress, copay, or mycelium (in that order) as good mobile wallets.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:49:57
I'm not the developer of this, but I really like it! The website seems to crash fairly often so I hope the developer is improving it. You can use any Lightning wallet to buy the gem, but if you wish to receive as well it's a bit trickier. You can use `lnd` with the special command line options provided on the website to increase the expiration time. It's also possible to use Eclair (desktop only), but you have to manually build [this fork]( from source to support custom expiry times, then add `eclair.payment-request-expiry=86400` to your `eclair.conf`.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:38:36
Not exactly. LN can operate without SegWit, just channels will "expire" and have to be closed after a certain amount of time, while with SegWit they can last until somebody wants to close them. This is because of transaction malleability, I think. Bitcoin Cash also has plans to implement alternative malleability fixes, I think.

Trading fees add up fast. YoBit reports getting nearly $100,000,000 in volume every day. I think that's inflated, but even at $10,000,000 per day, 0.2% fees mean a total of $20,000 per day. That's more than enough for very strong infrastructure.

When you use electrum's built-in seed generator, you cannot specify the derivation path. It would be possible for them to make it so that you can specify P2SH-P2WPKH addresses without having to do it manually, they just haven't.

Most wallets use the BIP 39 standard, so you can use it between wallets. If you import a seed from one wallet to another, the new wallet should be able to see all the transactions and spend money normally.
@_date: 2017-12-29 19:20:18
Nope. Electrum's generated seeds do not conform to BIP 39 (they use a custom mnemonic standard).
EDIT: you could also download the webpage, check the source code quickly, and generate it securely. There are other offline generation tools (i.e, other wallets).

Brand new account. No other comments/posts. Just a couple days after Bitpay announces Bitcoin Cash and other blockchain support. No proof whatsoever, it's very likely these people got hacked, lost seeds, etc. Seems like a shill campaign against BitPay because of their support for Bitcoin Cash.

If you have a few hundred million dollars, then yes. Look at how much money you saved! Otherwise, you probably will not have enough mining power to do this.

Your transaction simply got dropped from the mempool and copay didn't handle it well. In my experience, Copay has handled this sort of thing very well, I even tested a real double-spend after confirmation scenario on testnet and it worked fine. If you made a much less-angry post you would have gotten advice to import the seed to another wallet like Electrum and it would work fine.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:28:58
I remember these bought at 4.3k threads when it dropped to 3k. One thing to remember is that even if the bubble is popping, it wont go right away.

There are legit reasons for this (although I don't agree with them), such as making it harder to run a node because of higher bandwidth/storage costs.


Except this time, Core's chain might be the minority one, leaving 2x as the "main" one. Remember: Core != Bitcoin. Bitcoin can change without Core's approval, and it's better that this happens sooner rather than later; people shouldn't become used to a single dev group having control over the protocol.

Litecoin is not a hard fork, only Bitcoin Cash is. Litecoin is a completely separate altcoin. Bitcoin Cash was mainly created to lower fees, yes.

@_date: 2017-08-28 15:55:27
The correct answer is No for multiple reasons: In addition to that "Bitcoin" is still being used, BCH changes the difficulty adjustment algorithm, which is strictly against these rules.
I personally think, however, that this bet was not written very well because SegWit blocks can be greater than 1mb without a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:40:07
If it gets regulated heavily in major western countries, that's pretty f-ing bad. The main thing that average people use fiat for is buying stuff; Bitcoin is supposed to replace it for that function.

@_date: 2017-08-11 00:56:47
You don't need the individual private keys, the 12 word seed phrase is enough (apps use the seed phrase to generate the private keys). Your best bet is to get [Electron Cash]( and when creating a wallet, choose to restore from a seed phrase. Then (this is very important), click the options button and check the BIP 39 box before entering your seed (EDIT: if you are restoring from an electrum seed, don't do this! Only do this if you are restoring from a seed generated outside of electrum). Then, continue wallet creation normally, and all your transactions and coins should appear once it's done syncing, and you can spend them.
But, please don't sell your BCH! It has a future! Also, don't use blockchain.info...like all web wallets, it's insecure.
@_date: 2017-08-25 16:56:26
Several reasons fees are high and transactions are slow right now:
* Very few wallets support SegWit, so very few SegWit transactions are occuring. Ledger is the only good wallet supporting SegWit currently. It's basically been a "paper activation" so far.
* Lots of miners are mining BCH currently, but BTC's difficulty hasn't had time to adjust to this yet, so blocks are coming more rarely than normal.
* As Bitcoin gets more popular, more people are using it and no scaling has occured, so naturally there are more transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:58:19


Nothing is idiot proof, my friend.
@_date: 2017-08-26 01:27:24
Eventually, miners will only get money from fees. If there aren't any fees, how do they get paid? But, the Bitcoin Cash way of thinking about this is that it's important for fees to be low right now to help adoption, and we can cross that bridge when we get to it.

Nope. If that's all miners wanted, they could have signalled for BIP 141 or BIP 91 without 2x and avoided any potential BIP 148 chain split that way. But, they didn't. The only reason they did activate BIP 91 in the end was because they wanted 2x. And you think now they will just give it up? Lol.

Except nobody uses gold for anything but as a store of value and for extremely high value transactions, while Satoshi clearly designed Bitcoin with smaller transactions in mind: 


minimum practical transaction size and ***cutting off the possibility for small casual transactions***,
and there is a broader cost in the loss of ability to make non-reversible payments for nonreversible
(emphasis mine), which clearly implies that Bitcoin will allow "small casual transactions". Additionally, he designed an SPV system, which would be useless if everybody ran full nodes.

Miners make the network secure and process transactions. Without miners or with very few miners, it becomes easy to "double spend" a coin: you can give the same coin to multiple people, which obviously should not be able to happen. Currently it would cost millions of dollars to do that.
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:18:38
I did a double spend on testnet yesterday and plan to make a youtube tutorial about it in a few days. I ran int o a few unexpected issues along the way that I'll include workarounds for.
No, you don't need to sync mainnet. Just testnet. I was able to successfully double spend with only about $5 worth of rented hashrate on miningrigrentals.com (it was actually closer to $10 but after double spending i just pointed it at a normal pool for the rest of the rented time and recouped about half of the rental price).
@_date: 2017-08-27 01:30:03
Miners currently get free money for each block, eventually they will stop getting that and are only paid with fees. Some other coins are trying out PoS which sort of makes this less necessary and allows you to get away with lower fees because minters aren't focused on ROI anymore.

I thought that SegWit was better for decentralization than a simple 2mb hard fork because it changes the economics of the system to encourage transactions with less UTXOs, which are arguably more harmful in the long term than just block size?
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:40:47
You need to be a miner, with tens of millions of dollars of equipment, to collect fees. Want lower fees? Try Litecoin, Bitcoin Cash, or wait for fees in Bitcoin to become lower once SegWit becomes more popular, the 2mb hard fork occurs in November, and the Lightning Network starts being used.

To do any quick selling/buying, your coins need to be in an exchange, which is inherently less secure. On bitfinex and many other exchanges you can set up stop/limit orders, which will allow you to automatically place an order if the price reaches a certain threshold. Bitfinex also has a cool "trailing stop" feature, which basically says if Bitcoin ever drops X amount, sell it, regardless of what the actual price is. So, if you set a trailing stop with a threshold of $500, and bitcoin went up to $6500, then back down to $5500, you'd sell automatically at $6000.
@_date: 2017-08-25 19:26:49
more hashrate doesn't affect how "bitcoiny" it is. Bitcoin is defined as what a majority of users, businesses, etc use. If all miners decided to soft fork to 50kb, for example, none of the users or businesses would stand for it, and they would run software that requires &gt;50kb blocks. So, the 50kb chain would not be Bitcoin.

Correct. 2x hard fork is the same type as Cash hardfork, except it's not creating an altcoin; it might become unclear which chain is "Bitcoin". Additionally, since 2x is not designed to be on a separate chain (it's supposed to be the only one), there's no replay protection, so you'll need to do it yourself: After the fork, on both chains, send all your coins to different addresses.

Layer 2, which I assume he means LN by, is not like banks or credit cards at all, it is decentralized and trustless just like Bitcoin. While there totally is an argument for large blocks/against Core, this isn't one. Additionally, the patents issue isn't for LN i think, it's for Segwit, which is not in itself a layer 2 solution.

When I say Bitcoin Core, I mean the most popular full-node client for Bitcoin, and the team that develops it.
In terms of how changes are made to Bitcoin...imagine you're with a group of friends walking through the desert. You want to get through the desert more quickly by running part of the time, and walking for part of the time. You propose this to your friends. If they all agree, then you can decide how to manage this "upgrade" (maybe 1 hour of running for every 4 hours of walking), and then you come to consensus, and then do it. But what if a few of your friends don't want to run? Well, you can either just decide to stick with them, because power in numbers, or you can decide to run anyways. If you are the only one running, then you're obviously in the minority, and you have broken off from the main group. If, however, a majority of the friends decide to come along with you, and only a few stay behind and walk, it's fair to say that the "runners" are the main group.
Bitcoin upgrades are the same way. Either, the community can come to consensus and do something together, or groups of people can break off and do their own thing. And if enough of these people do their own thing, then that's "Bitcoin". You could work Core into this analogy by saying that your group of friends picks a few people to form a group which proposes things that should be done to aid your desert-walking, and trusts them to make good decisions, and they often do...but if they don't, it's still possible for the others to break away from them, which is sort of what's happening right now with Segwit2x.
I hope that makes sense.
@_date: 2017-08-26 00:59:29
It's important to understand that Bitcoin Core is not the same as Bitcoin. They do not own Bitcoin. They don't control Bitcoin. They are not the only functional full node software. The comments on the linked post mainly point to how Bitcoin Core changes are made and proposed. But it's completely possible for changes to Bitcoin to be made without Bitcoin Core's approval, as is currently ongoing with Segwit2x.

Doing it from a mobile app doesn't make much sense, running a highly-used LN node will mean lots of bandwidth used, which is bad outside of wifi range, as well as a non-insignificant amount of CPU power and memory space. Wouldn't be so great for battery life.

Isn't this pretty much what the case was going to be with BIP 148 until BIP 91 activated, a segwit and non-segwit chain starting at the same point, with the non-segwit chain being longer (probably)?

what do you mean by "unpair"? They aren't paired in any way, they are exactly the same wallet. If you spend BTC from electrum, it will show up as spent in blockchain.info as well. If you don't want to use blockchain.info anymore, just stop using it.
@_date: 2017-08-27 18:33:02
It's pretty simple if you have a significant amount of hashrate (you could rent enough hashrate on miningrigrentals.com or nicehash for pretty cheap). What you do is run Bitcoin Core (i think 0.14 or newer is needed) with --testnet flag or config option, send a transaction, wait for it to get the number of confirms needed, then give it the RPC command `invalidateblock &lt;blockhashhere&gt;` where &lt;blockhashhere&gt; is the hash of the block where your transaction got confirmed. Then, you start mining on that node, and if you have enough hashpower you can overcome the main chain and your coins will be returned! However, after getting your chain to be longest, you may need to relaunch Core with --rescan option before the coins show up in your wallet again. I can walk you through the details if this isn't clear enough.

Hopefully more wallets will implement SegWit soon, and payment processors/exchanges will start accepting it. I'd say within a month it'll be noticeable. Additionally, just having normal block times would be a big plus, that will take 2-3 weeks. In November, increased block size will fix the problem for quite a while.

technically, it's doubling the block weight, since the concept of "block size" is irrelevant now that we have SegWit. SegWit already allows ~2mb blocks once most people start using it (still a few months away), 2x will bring that up to about 4mb.

Bitcoin Cash is temporarily more profitable to mine than Bitcoin, so a lot of miners are switching over to it for now. This is causing bitcoin blocks to come more rarely than normal. So, the unconfirmed transactions are piling up. Most people aren't using SegWit yet so it isn't really helping out in terms of scaling yet, it will be a long, gradual thing.

Not really. The only part which is hashed is the header, only 80 bytes. The limit on the size is what causes high fees, not the size being bigger. Making higher thoroughputs expensive is completely artificial.

If they really don't care at all about the new chain, they can continue transacting on the old chain and replay attacks will not affect them. Additionally, it isn't that hard to work around replay attacks. Once again, I'd recommend that you learn what a replay attack actually is before talking about it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 18:28:17
Segwit2x has multiple developers, but only a few people have direct access to the repository, to prevent random people from committing malicious code. So, people make pull requests, and jgarzik merges them when they look good. Whenever you see "merged pull request" in a commit message, that's what happened.
Replay protection isn't exactly "segwit2x will be able to take all your coins...and you will have no choice in the matter". Protecting yourself against replay protection is relatively simple, you just send all coins to different addresses on each chain. Additionally, replay protection doesn't allow the segwit2x devs to take your coins or anything...go research what replay attacks are and what they do.
Segwit2x is well-tested, it's been under development for months, and it's been battle-tested on testnets. Bitcoin Cash forked off successfully with no security issues with much less development time, and Segwit2x is much simpler than Bitcoin Cash in terms of what it does, because it has no replay protection, no new transaction types, etc.
There are less commits on the Segwit2x repo than on the main Bitcoin one because the Segwit2x repo is meant only to contain changes that are for the hard fork. Unrelated features, such as speeding up syncing and extra RPC calls, are not being added to BTC1 but they are being added to Core because of this. BTC1 will probably merge in these changes in the future.
Implementing replay protection on Segwit2x would cause existing transactions to be invalidated, which is what occured on Bitcoin Cash. So, if you used a payment channel with somebody before, it wouldn't work after the hard fork. Segwit2x is designed as an upgrade, not an altcoin, so this is out of the question.

The time of a block has to be greater than the median time of the last 11 blocks. It doesn't need to be strictly greater than the last block. Nodes will also reject timestamps more than 2 hours ahead of the "network time" (basically the local time of nodes they're connected to).

BIP 39 is basically the system for turning those 12+ word seeds into a whole bunch of private keys and addresses. Electrum doesn't use BIP 39 by default and has their own custom seed word system, so you need to enable BIP 39 support in order to make it use the same seed system as blockchain.info and most other wallets.

Doing replay protection on Segwit2x would cause existing transactions to not be usable anymore, a major issue for anybody doing escrow, payment channel, or other off-chain things already. I chatted with on IRC and he said that this was one of the many gripes that he had with Bitcoin Cash, was that it broke existing transactions. Since Segwit2x is meant to be an upgrade to Bitcoin rather than a minority chain, doing replay protection is pretty much out of the question.

First of all that makes no sense because you'd get both forks by holding. Additionally, this isn't trustless because it requires an escrow to handle the transfer of the large transaction and the current-BTC payment. If you want to give a 1:2 or 1:3 trade for several tens of thousands of dollars to make the tx fees less significant, which, if you are so sure 2x will fail, you should be willing to give, then go ahead and I'm sure somebody will take you up on your offer.

Bitcoin Core 0.15 was hostile. This commit is just a response to that. Core would already ban BTC1 nodes after the fork automatically in 0.14; no code change was needed. Therefore, changing Core to explicitly ban BTC1 clients is an attempt to stop users from using alternate software to Bitcoin Core, in order to keep the current development team in power.

The concept is that Bitcoin is currently overvalued (lots more people investing in it than actually using it), and therefore the price will fall quite a lot at some point in the near future. It will probably eventually climb up again to above current levels, but it might take a while.

With other wallets you know what chain you are on as well. You can choose which servers to connect to. Copay, for example, is on 2x, and Breadwallet is on non-2x (i think). Additionally, I think Breadwallet and Mycelium let you connect to your own full node. Knowing which chain you're on has nothing to do with replay protection, by the way, they're not the same thing.
@_date: 2017-10-05 02:37:59
It's not objectively bad.
Arguments for 2x: People have been advocating for block size increases for years. It's about fucking time to get one. It's the quickest way to increase the capacity of Bitcoin. LN will eventually need larger blocks anyways. Core doesn't want to do it, so now the responsibility falls to third parties.
Arguments against: It's being pushed mainly by corporations, not users. Bitcoin may not need a block size increase immediately, especially since SegWit is effectively doubles block size and LN may be functional before we outgrow the 2mb-or-so effective block size limit.

Bitcoin is constantly fluctuating. The feeling that it always drops after you buy is, in my experience, just a mental thing, because if it goes up 10% after buying it, you don't feel like it's gone up very much, but when it goes down 10%, it feels like a lot.
@_date: 2017-10-09 23:08:58
SegWit is already done and activated. The SegWit2x fork is going to double the block size to allow double the number of transactions per block, and therefore double the capacity of the network. However, that's not necessarily a good thing, because it causes lower fees (less incentives for miners) and makes it harder to run a node. It's a complex issue.

2X could be done keeping Core in charge, but Core doesn't want to, so there aren't very many remaining options.
Blocksize increases were suggested 5+ years ago, and Core even signed an agreement in Hong Kong during 2016 to increase the blocksize then backed out. They've had chance after chance to do it, but they didn't, so now the only way to get a blocksize increase is by somebody else doing it. **There is literally no other way to increase the blocksize but to have third parties do it at this point.** And who has the most influence, apart from Core? Businesses and miners. So naturally they are the ones supporting 2x. Or maybe it's a crazy conspiracy or evil companies who decided to randomly take over Bitcoin this year, with no warning or negotiations. I'll let you decide.
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:45:15
Anybody retracting support because of a lack of replay protection is stupid. If they really believe it will be an "upgrade" to the Bitcoin protocol rather than an altcoin, which is what is implied by their agreement, replay protection will not be necessary. Additionally, UASF never had replay protection and people on this sub never got angry, even though it was on track to be an altcoin until S2X.

@_date: 2017-10-11 18:56:26
The weight system is largely to change how transactions are incentivized, by making transactions with less utxos cheaper than a transaction of the same size with more utxos, because utxos cause more ram usage during syncing, and if the utxo set is larger than the amount of memory on a machine, verification becomes very slow. I may be wrong about this, but I don't think it is possible to implement this system in a backwards-compatible way without increasing the block size.
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:12:13
Samourai wallet devs are somewhat incompetent: 
The first tweet says that Samourai is not an SPV wallet. This implies that it is a full node, but it definitely is not (most mobile devices can't even store the blockchain). After I ask him to clarify, the lead dev says that the wallet **does not verify headers**, and is therefore not SPV. Since it is not a full node nor does not verify headers, it has no way to verify the validity of the blocks, or to verify whether a transaction has been confirmed or not. If this is true, Samourai is literally just a remote interface for the official Samourai servers, and is no more secure than a web wallet. The dev did not respond to my reply asking for further clarification to verify whether this is really the case.
If that is really how Samourai works, it would be trivial for the servers, if compromised, to send out invalid transactions to the wallets. Most wallets (breadwallet, copay, electrum, mycelium, etc) would not follow invalid blocks; the only attack the server can do is hold back blocks/transactions from the wallet, which means that you would not be able to see certain transactions even after they are confirmed. However, in Samourai, it could make you see fake transactions. Imagine somebody says they are paying you $10,000, and it shows up in your wallet, then it's reversed. That's possible in Samourai, but not most SPV wallets.
**Do not use Samourai Wallet unless you point it at your own full node. It is less secure than real SPV clients. Use Breadwallet, Mycelium, Copay, or another wallet that has real SPV verification.**
Maybe I misunderstood the dev or his statement was a mistake, but since they did not respond to my final tweet, I am inclined to believe Samourai is a web wallet.
EDIT: pinging hoping for some clarification on this.

In the [Lightning Network whitepaper]( the developers of it said that in order to facilitate the world's population it would still need 133mb blocks eventually. That figure is for even more scaling than visa, but it is clear that the LN devs don't think 1mb is going to cut it in the long term. They also say that a machine with pruning enabled and a 2tb disk (currently costs $60-$80 for a decent one) would be able to fully verify a chain with 133mb blocks, given they could handle the bandwidth. Assuming you only care about blocks and not mempool, the 133mb block figure is only about 7tb of data per year, which fits even within Comcast's limited bandwidth caps. LN isn't replace the blockchain, it augments it, and it can't make a 1mb block size handle all the transactions in the world.

@_date: 2017-10-10 00:30:28
1mb with $1 per-tx fees is higher than 2mb with $0.1 fees. I personally think that Bitcoin will soon outgrow even 2mb blocks and still have decent fees, which is why i support SegWit2x.
People are working on ways to allow miners to be incentivized while also keeping fees low for people. One of these ideas is the Lightning Network, which makes smaller transactions cheaper because they don't need to individually go on the blockchain anymore. There's also PoS in the works on some other cryptocurrencies, which means you don't need hardware to do mining, which makes it less necessary to have such high fees in the first place.
@_date: 2017-10-22 17:30:10
Not necessarily. If you have 1,000 transactions paying $10 each, that's the same as 10,000 transactions paying $1 each. If more people use Bitcoin (and the block size is increased), it's possible for miners to get the same pay with lower fees.
Additionally, the Lightning Network is being developed for Bitcoin, and will allow medium-small transactions to occur without having to put every single one in a block (it basically combines many transactions into a single one which summarizes the smaller ones), which should massively decrease fees for small transactions.

With Bitcoin Cash, what happened is that a fork of Electrum called "Electron Cash" was created, and you just entered your seed into it to use your Bitcoin Cash. However, for 2x, it will be simpler, because it does not affect SPV clients. All you will need to do is go into your Electrum settings and manually select a server that runs BTC1 Core instead of Bitcoin Core, and then it will be on the new chain. I'm sure people will make guides about how to do this as the date approaches.
@_date: 2017-10-15 18:52:39


So, the client wallet does **not** verify PoW, only the back end does? How can the client protect against the server sending invalid blocks if it was compromised?


Many web wallets, such as Blockchain.info, also never transmit the key to the server. I define "web wallet" as any wallet that does not verify PoW.
Basically, my original question, which has still not been answered: **Does the Samourai wallet (not server) verify PoW of block headers, or not?**

If BIP 148 really gets &lt;1% hashrate, which is the way things are looking right now, it will get 1-2 blocks a day. People **will** switch off of it, regardless of how much they support it, because it's useless.

The only people who it matters for are economically important sites such as exchanges, gambling, payment gateways, etc, or miners. The miners don't really care how many individuals use BIP 148 because if the economic majority doesn't adopt it, users will be forced to switch to the main chain because their uasf coins are useless (this is what's going to happen, by the way).

Well, I mean they can't literally change the software on your computer, but for all practical purposes if you don't have any miners, you can't effectively use a chain. I see your point if literally **all** economically important nodes switched to bip 148, but even if there are just a few major exchanges which stay on the non-bip-148 chain (and there will be more than a few), that will be enough for miners not to feel the need to switch off of it.
