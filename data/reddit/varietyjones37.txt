My apologies. I've been trying to figure out a better way of implementing updated clues and letting players know when a specific clueset gets additional hints. Still chippin' away at it... but a few new hints / correct seeds have been added to    and  with more sets to be updated by end of day.

The green words are correct seeds that would be inputted into Electrum. 
They also help serve as proof that the clues and games are legitimate, since the seeds cannot be changed for a particular wallet. 
The purple words relate to that particular correct seed, but not necessarily to other seeds.
ex:  
"movie" was in purple. The correct seed word is "ticket" 
Associated words, phrases, definitions, synonyms, antonyms, etc
The green words might relate to one another, but that's Electrum's doing, and unintentional.

Adding more clue sets and hints. 
Still have some donuts sitting around...

Right. Gotta find a balance that makes it relatively fair for people who want to automate guesses and those that want to manually guess. The current structure is indeed inadequate though, and I hope to make many improvements over the coming weeks.

was it you? I haven't received word from anyone else, but do see that the prize has been claimed.

Was it an error or was it an unfair trick? ;)

do you have a twitter account I can changetip to? i'm getting an error trying to use reddit.

Thanks. 
Ooo, i like that idea as well.
I'm still trying to figure out a way to implement a way of checking/guessing in-browser that doesn't make it an easy target for hackers. Will keep ya posted!

I'm hoping to implement a crossword-style format this month. Intersecting letters of seed words as well as the # of characters in a seed word should make the games more solvable.

People make different connections.  
bald - scalp - scalping ...ticket
or if you remembered a clue from another game.
