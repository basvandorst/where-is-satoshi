A NEW LAP RECORD 
@_date: 2017-03-18 16:02:46
I have a lot more confidence in BTC after it broke it's old all time high. 
That being said, there has been some bad news this month. At $1100-1200 I think your money is safe if you don't sell. When it hits those highs again is anyone's guess.

Rising wedge hitting the 50% on the Fibonacci at $1100 with no good news is bearish imo. 
Down to $950 or $750? 
Of course, never underestimate....hope

Thank you for all the tips! I think I'll be only be investing $500 into the ETF (if it passes). 
Like early BTC I just like being along for the ride and supporting it where I can.

Welcome to BTC   ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

But you can Hodl and trade....
Like me, hodl 5 BTC and trade around when ever there is volatility for fun. Trading is a skill and you have to learn sometime.

Food and shelter or Bitcoin. 
The age old question

and they called me crazy a month ago! muahahha

I remember in 2013 it was common to see +-20%, 50% etc. 
In the last run up in 2014 it was a lot like this too
@_date: 2017-03-20 21:37:51
O yea, let me call coinbase support to get this all cleared up.
..o wait

One other thing that is odd about this run up is that I haven't seen to many whales on the exchanges. In 2013-4 I would see people with 30k BTC pop up, now the most I see is 30 BTC.

To the moon! What more do you need to know! :^)

Considering I remember seeing bitcoin at like $14.00 on the silkroad. :P
This is just imo but some of the willingness to buy bitcoin might go down when people can't buy 1 BTC, .5 BTC or .25 BTC. It'll feel weird to HAVE to buy .025 BTC as an investment.

Big drop..You must be new here considering I was picking up BTC at $98 a year ago.

I'm now $13 in profit! Feelsgoodman

Resistance is at 750, 545 and 200. Likely won't hit lower then 545.
