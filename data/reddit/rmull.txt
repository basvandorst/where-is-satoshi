Nice application / proof of concept. If bitcoin becomes popular enough where you can reasonably expect most people to have access to it, then I could imagine that this type of feature will be natively implemented by various mail clients. For the time being, it's a good demonstration of things that can be done with bitcoin that can't (currently) be done with regular money.

The absence of core releases does not necessarily correlate with development effort. You can check the github graphs or the git log for a more reasonable idea, but this doesn't take into account experimental work that hasn't been committed to the parent repository. Some of this stuff needs to be tested very thoroughly before getting pushed.

I agree wholeheartedly. Many are conditioned to automatically disregard evangelists. Bitcoin is often written off as a pyramid scheme, a ponzi scheme, or a scam, and the legion of aggressive door-to-door penny tippers isn't doing much to convince people of its actual technical merits.

This sort of argument always irritates me. It's too evangelical. Tip on today's exchange rate. Not everyone shares your beliefs about where the value of bitcoin will be in the future. It's like people that leave those fake tips in restaurants with bible verses on them and stuff.
@_date: 2014-11-07 17:40:26
The problem is that it's spammy and not everybody is keen on receiving tips of a fraction of a cent. I would not be surprised if the changetip bot gets banned from more and more subreddits in the future.

It's real - 1 million bits in a bitcoin, bitcoins are trading for approximately $370 at the moment. 
Most of the tips are very small amounts in USD, but they can accumulate.
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:33:38
Would this be sufficient? Coinbase would still have the link, right? I guess someone would have to have access to Coinbase's records as well as Changetip's, but I'm not going to assume this is impossible.
@_date: 2014-09-22 16:08:52
That makes sense, but then you need to start worrying about the amounts in each wallet. Since you can never link the various addresses with a transaction, it's possible that you will end up with unspendable BTC in each wallet just because you can't find something that costs exactly what is in each wallet, right? If you were to transmit your coins from one wallet to another in order to be able to afford something that costs more than what you have in just one wallet, then the transaction history for all wallets involved converge and give a larger picture of your spending history.
@_date: 2014-11-06 06:18:42
I think the bot is having a hard time keeping up with all the tip requests.
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:54:19
The technology behind tipping is not so complicated where it couldn't be replicated. ChangeTip has not given the community reason to work around them yet, so there has been little motivation to build an alternative.

Just so everyone is clear, the OB "job listing" approach is not something you ordinarily see in the open source space. If there was a developer who wanted to contribute some code to the project, they'd do so, and they wouldn't bother with treating it like an actual job, because it isn't. Whether or not the core dev team wants to accept the changes is a separate issue. Painting the "position" like it's an unpaid internship feels weird.
That said, it's often difficult for open source projects to generate good and coherent user experiences because there is no single unifying vision and everyone involved is something of an engineer. Maybe OB's approach (should it yield fruit) will help avoid this common issue.

Why not just use bitcoin the way it was intended instead of relying on changetip? Changetip is nice and fun and convenient for transferring money to someone over social media, but so is using an actual wallet especially when the recipient is set up to receive bitcoin already.

As time goes on and the blockchain stores more and more transactions from more and more people, won't it become easier and easier to associate transactions with specific people or entities?

There is a well established distinction between something being "free as in speech" and something being "free as in beer."

However, it is not "free software" according to the definition given by the Free Software Foundation. In English, there is some ambiguity in the word "free," hence the speech/beer comparison.

In the end, it seems like the gen.py script would have to be modified a good bit in order to support arbitrary graphics and QR placement. At the moment it seems like all it does is create the C/H files and a JPG image that I assume is meant to be the paper wallet output eventually, but it's not a complete representation. The only image you can control at the moment is the logo that appears at the top right of the wallet, and it seems like it gets converted to grayscale.
It looks like more work is left to be done.

They can't use it without the passphrase. They store a key that only you can use as a safety measure in case you lose your personal key.

I agree. Reasons not to use "bits" as a name for 100 satoshis:
* A bit already has many meanings outside bitcoin, both general and specific. (I bit on a bit of a bit is a grammatically correct phrase)
* A bit has a very clear meaning in the digital space, which bitcoin is attempting to occupy. A bit is a unit of digital storage. (A megabit per second, a kilobit of storage space)
* A bit in the general sense has connotations of indivisibility, whereas a bit in the context of bitcoin can be divided 100 times (Does 1.73 bits make sense?)
My opinion is that of retaining the "bitcoin" moniker, but redefining it to mean 100 satoshis. The currency is young enough where the transition phase probably won't be too jarring, especially if software also transitions to the XBT label instead of BTC. Bitcoin has already made waves - the name is good, it's unambiguous, and it has a few years' worth of cultural legacy by now.
EDIT: But I'd take anything other than "bits." Bit-cents/dollars, the metric prefixes, anything.

I wrote a quick and dirty blockchain parser of my own (in C, maybe that's less relevant to you web software hipsters), check it out at 
Parsing the blockchain from the disk is one thing - interacting with it in real time is another. You'll have to look into bitcoind to see how the network is maintained and how you might "jack in" to the data stream and actually interact with it. The transaction format will be the same as it is on disk but you probably won't want to wait for bitcoind to log the block to disk before you can work with it.

The value in changetip is the ability to simultaneously transmit bitcoin as well as introduce bitcoin to someone who doesn't know how to use it. To do this without the third party you would have to conduct an exchange-of-address with the recipient, which requires them to know what they're doing.
Yes, it's a centralized entity that can run away with all the BTC at the drop of a hat, and there is a ToS and a fee that will possibly be implemented in the future, and big bad corporations have a tendency to absorb young successful startups, but in life one must make compromises. Perhaps somebody will evolve the tipping activity to address some of these concerns and we can move to a purer model, but for now this is what we have and it seems effective.

Cameron, your presentation says you've never sold a single bitcoin. Why not keep a small wallet aside from the primary investments from which you can transact freely? I'm not suggesting you sell it for fiat - I'm suggesting you support the technology by not only taking a bullish stance on the investment but also by actually using it in a practical manner. It'll give you a feel for how the BTC ecosystem is doing in terms of maturity, and it'll also show others that you believe in BTC as a useful currency.
@_date: 2014-10-28 18:11:18
That's fine, but doing something again just because it's been done in the past is not always the best way to do something. Since we have an opportunity to completely reboot the financial system, we might as well optimize it as best we can and ditch whatever legacy cruft might still be clinging to it. We already know that shoehorning bitcoin into the existing system is not going to work out. It's a round peg in a square hole. Make it different if it's better that way.

Don't forget to be as unambiguous as possible when tipping to help the bot get it right. In general, use the tip moniker and the call to the bot on the same line and separate from the rest off the text, and be as specific as possible with the moniker.

The estimated Gross World Product in 2012 was approximately $85trillion according to 
There are a maximum of 21million BTC, and at its finest resolution of a satoshi, that makes 2.1 quadrillion units of value store because there are 100 million satoshi in a bitcoin.
Therefore, if the entire world dropped their existing currencies in favor of bitcoin and the world's economy looked like it did in 2012, a satoshi would be worth about 85b/2.1q = 4 cents.

Nothing new here - you can prove you own a given bitcoin wallet address because only you control the private key associated with it, and therefore you can sign and distribute things with that key. See the thread here: 
In the more general sense, proof of identity is usually performed using PGP (or GPG) keypairs and employing a "web of trust." You can sign the keys of people you know, often at events called key-signing parties, and the web of trust expands. If you need to publish data, you can clearsign it with your private key and others can verify that the resulting signature can only be achieved by the owner of your private key (you).

There are three keys involved: Yours, Coinbase's, and a shared key. The shared key is encrypted and passphrase protected with the passphrase of your choice.
2 of 3 keys are required to move the coins. You don't need Coinbase's key, since you can use your private key and the shared key for which you know the password. The recovery tool permits this so that you still have access to your coins even if Coinbase becomes inaccessible, and I assume it interacts with the blockchain independently of Coinbase (although I did not verify this).

That's good stuff - one thing that occurred to me was the way you refer to "virtual currency users." In some minds, this label may already be an indictment. For example, imagine if there was a group of people experimenting with and starting companies surrounding a newly-discovered form of hallucinogenic substance that has not had enough time to be classified as illegal. If you were a member of such a community, you might refer to yourselves as "hallucinogenic substance users" under the impression that it was quite legal and participation in the community was simply an expression of your creativity and an outlet for innovation. However, because of the obvious negative connotation that follows that sort of stuff, you're already admitting guilt in a way. Similarly, a group labeled "virtual currency users" might not necessarily be perceived as harmless or aboveboard, especially considering how easily drugs, hitmen, etc can be acquired with virtual currency. As a result, it seems like you're asking for favors for criminals (which you are not, but legislators may not feel the same way).
It might be helpful to do one of two things: either don't assume that referring to the group as "virtual currency users" is a safe thing to do, or better yet, include an introductory blurb about how much good virtual currency can do and why those who use it do so from a position that is legally and ethically defensible.
Just my two cents.

Do you think changetip has the potential to cause harm? Enabling microtips changes the tipping ecosystem a good deal. Some people may now begin to expect tips where none previously existed. On the other hand, some people who don't expect tips are offended by microtips instead of appreciating that something was given regardless of how small. Bounty systems for open source software projects affect the motives that previously existed for contributing developers.
Are there any plans to improve the moniker-matching algorithm used by the changetip bot? I've had two people mis-tip me because they didn't expect the bot to match something and it did.

You're fine - HD wallets cycle your wallet addresses so that they never get reused. If you select your account and drop down the "triple dot" icon at the top right, you can show your unspent outputs, which will be stored across multiple wallet addresses.

Why isn't the price of bitcoin currently, or eventually, correlated to the amount of energy it takes to mine the coin? If the BTC price is less than the energy cost, miners would sooner buy the coin, and turn off the miners. If the BTC cost is greater than the energy cost, miners will mine.

Bitcoin's cryptography is specifically _not_ security through obscurity. The algorithms to derive the keys are well-known, not hidden. They are subject to scrutiny by researchers and have not presented any collisions (that I know of, to date) that shrink the key space. The OPs suggestion relies on nobody knowing the "algorithm" by which the data is hidden. If somebody knew the algorithm, the data would be revealed easily. Nobody can verify that the algorithm is secure without knowing it in the first place.

I agree with your point. Binary data transmission can occur over a huge number of diverse channels, and therefore a bitcoin transaction can be conducted over some pretty funky systems. Eventually, though, it needs to get back to the rest of the blockchain, but it can take any number of hops before it gets there.
However, I don't think that hiding your private keys in a bible using a private encoding method should be considered a secure storage technique.

You're right. The brand reputation issue is one I hadn't considered when wishing for a community-based open wallet design. If just anyone can manufacture the hardware, it is difficult to verify that it has not been tampered with.
I'm not sure that SatoshiLabs shot themselves in the foot. Do you really think profit is not important to business? If they had not reverted the license, then that would have been a major problem. Since they have reverted the license, they demonstrated that they are willing to listen to community feedback and they are committed to being the best on the market. I think they acknowledged their mistake in the best and most reasonable possible way. It was definitely a mistake to do what they did, but I don't think it's one they'll be repeating because so much rides on the public's perception of them. Damage may have been done and some may abandon them for good, but I think SatoshiLabs means well.
They may be shortsighted (in assuming that no clones would emerge) and emotional (in rewriting their git history to implement restrictive licensing) but they are acknowledging their errors, and we should respect them for at least that.

You need to have a pretty large amount of investment/volume to get an ASIC fabbed. Not just anyone can do it.

That is true. My feelings are derived more from the foot-in-the-door strategy that Coinbase is using. I felt like first they showed me the greatness that I could have, and when I committed to it, then I get a "wait, one more thing" from them. Psychologically speaking, at this point, people are generally much easier to convince.
I understand that they are required to comply with whatever regulations are out there, but it's unfortunate that they aren't understood at the time of the products' deployment, and the necessary changes are instead sprung on the user after some time has passed and without notice.
I guess that's just part of the process of continually maturing and becoming mainstream.

The reversion will satisfy a lot of people, and that's good for business.
However, sometimes the full value of copyleft licensing is only fully realized when it is applied to a true community effort. In this case, SatoshiLabs has their best interests in mind - they need to make money because they are a business. It was shortsighted to think that nobody would spin out a knockoff, since [China will _always_ be able to source hardware cheaper]( Without having to spend the engineering time on development or maintenance (since SatoshiLabs did it for them), they don't need to mark anything up much at all, and it is surprising that the bwallet device costs as much as it does.
In the future, I would love to see a real community effort without corporate interference produce an open source hardware schematic, PCB layout, and source code.

A wallet refers to a number of indivisible currency units known as "satoshis." Yes, the wallet (identified by an address) can become tainted, which means all of the satoshis contained in it at the time become tainted. As the tainted wallet's address engages in transactions with other wallets, its outputs can all be traced back to the tainted wallet, which means the satoshis carry the taintedness.
When the coins are tumbled or mixed, it becomes difficult to trace the satoshis back to the wallet that earned the original taint. I don't know if it removes the taint entirely or not but I would assume it does until someone finds a way to link wallets before and after a tumble/mix.

Though it is possible that the merchants are emailing as requested instead of commenting, I do agree with you in that expectations of merchants is higher than it should be. In my humble opinion, paying the processing fees of the credit card companies that have a proven history of behavior, good or bad, may be preferable than sacrificing the same amount of money (or more) in order to support an experimental currency that is difficult to predict. I would not hold it against the merchant if they charged the same price for all available payment options.

In my opinion, the exchange has the right to do as they please in terms of accepting or rejecting tainted coins, but bitcoin tools need to evolve to make it more difficult to taint coins in the first place.

I agree. If bitcoin can't demonstrate its defensibility against known attacks, we have no proof of anything. I would consider this a penetration test and am looking forward to the results.

The third-party trust agent in multisig escrow doesn't control the funds. They control the 2nd signature in a 2-of-3 multisignature transaction.

An even more basic use-case for virtual accounts is to help manage personal spending. Let's say I was the sole user of this type of wallet, and I wanted to set aside 10% of my income each month for eating at restaurants. Not only could this kind of wallet help balance my virtual accounts by automatically allocating 10% of my deposited bitcoin into the "restaurants" virtual account, but it could also warn, deny, or request an account rebalance if I try to spend out of my "restaurants" account with a transaction that would put that account below 0BTC. In the background, all spending/receiving happens as it normally would with a modern HD wallet, but the actual balance is abstracted into the different categories before being presented to the user.

In addition to the comments regarding block size, sidechains are also a mechanism by which transactions can be cached by providers before hitting the blockchain itself.
