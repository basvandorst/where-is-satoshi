I asked him if he had gotten rich off of bitcoins and he said, I shit you not, "I have a rich inner life because of bitcoins."

Some people start later than others -- so 18 is actually pretty good youngest age to estimate that just about everyone will be done with puberty.
I'm not saying the '18' year age limit is always a good thing, but it actually is a pretty good number specifically for that.

What? What are you talking about?
@_date: 2014-11-10 14:56:18
I wish all these people talking about 'paid trolls' would say to themselves 'Hmm, do these jobs really exist? Let's see if I can find a job where I get paid to troll Bitcoin forums.'  Guess what, you will not find those jobs available because they don't exist!

I think we're talking about different things.  Here's my point:  With bitcoin you don't know if it could be worth double next week or half.  Why would you SPEND a bitcoin when it could be worth two bitcoins next week, and why would a merchant accept it when it could be worth half?
It seems as if bitcoins are functioning as investments, I don't see how they can logically be used as currency.

What I don't get is, even the people who own bitcoin, why on earth would you logically either spend it, or accept it?  It seems to be functioning as an investment not a currency -- with such value fluctuation, why would I spend a bitcoin if it could be worth double its value next week, and why would I accept a bitcoin if it could be worth half next week?

What's BFL?  I'm realizing with anonabox and this one I really enjoy seeing these scam-ripoff-companies get their due!

This post is the ravings of a delusional paranoid* and it sits at +217.  He was not offered a job as a 'professional troll.'  The fact that this post is so highly upvoted (and believed) is pretty good evidence of the type of community here.
Most of his posts are about professional trolls, and they are in response to people calling him 'crazy' for acting... well, totally crazy.  He is VERY invested in the idea that there are professional trolls, as that means that he is right and not a psycho.  So of course he's pretending to have been offered the actual job.  It's the people most emotionally invested in something that will just make up 'evidence.' He's so sure he's right that he assumes if he makes up this story, well it must be happening to someone somewhere, so why not pretend it happened to him?
*[who solved quantum mechanics with a bitcoin analogy!](  Please note his response to anyone accurately calling his 'theory' bonkers (his response is that anyone criticizing him is a paid troll.)

He only did that when he was FORCED to, and only after quite a few lies, obfuscations, and bullshit customer-blaming 'apologies.'

This is going to sound like I'm mocking you but I am  being 100% genuine: Is it possible you have romantic feelings for him?

Right, so you can't find a single example of anything even close to someone being paid to discredit Bitcoin.  
Why would they pay anyone when people like me will do it for free? Not to mention I think Bitcoin and it's community do a pretty good job discrediting themselves as it is.

How can something be a currency if there's no stability in price?
@_date: 2013-12-17 20:21:29
This is my main question about bitcoin:  Is it an investment or a currency?  Why would a logical person spend a bitcoin today when the value may double next week?
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:02:34


Thanks for the response -- that kind of leads right into my question, because you spent bitcoins, and the lesson you learned was that you shouldn't have, you should hoard them and wait for the value to increase.  So how will it function as a currency? 
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:22:16
I dunno, I actually don't really know anything about bitcoin.  I guess I meant has it been endorsed by the creator of bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:22:45
Exactly.  And since they are not being used as a currency, there is no intrinsic value as an investment.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:34:56
Oh.  Well damn, I clearly DON'T know anything about bitcoins!  Anonymous creator? Interesting.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:58:22
You're absolutely right that 'illegal items' is a good use of bitcoins.  But that doesn't really answer the question of why a logical consumer would spend their bitcoins on drugs when they could double their money by NOT spending the bitcoins.
Most people can get drugs in real life with cash, it may be riskier, but I would say not risky enough for most people to spend a potentially valuable asset.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:26:13


I don't think it does imply that, just that Bitcoin is functioning as an investment vehicle and not a currency.  Stocks get bought and sold all the time.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:30:17
Right, but rarely the other way around.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:34:24
But my question is WHY would someone buy something in bitcoins, if they could just wait a week and possibly double their money?
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:20:15
Hey serious question as someone who doesn't know a lot about bitcoins: Why would someone use them as a currency when they clearly function as an investment?   I mean, why would you buy something with bitcoins when the value may double next week?
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:00:15
Thank you for the excellent response.  Wouldn't that practically be an insurmountable flaw in Bitcoin?  Doesn't its 'intrinsic value' come from its supposed use as a currency?
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:22:02
That is a terrific design, who created it? I've seen it around, is it official?
