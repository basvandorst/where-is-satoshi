This makes me so happy

Ah ofcourse, another one of Kims monthly ominous pump comments.
@_date: 2017-12-12 01:49:24
Funny cause not once in this piece did they mention bitcoin other than the fact that the CFTC sees it as a commodity. This statement is in regrds to ICO's and the like. Not bitcoin.

Wants to use EOS. Why not look into partnering with RSK? Looks like just another token grab to me.

The US is at the end of a terrible expansion cycle, so all pundits know that its a bubble. Central banking influence and money make these pundits into whores that will say anything to joe shmoe, so that he'll keep dumping his worthless cash into more derivative instruments. They'll never admit to any sort of economic policy error until the whole population gets fucked.

Interesting, I dig it. Power to the artists.

The more info the better! Thanks!

What's important is to build a strong fundamental protocol that will empower the people. Protocols aren't made up over night, I'm sure they spent as much time as they could to make sure the bitcoin protocol was sound.

nice try FBI.

Took me a while to learn this.
@_date: 2015-06-09 18:46:36
Thank you, I was so confused as to what it's purpose was, you've really helped!

There is no way of guaranteeing that bitcoin will make you a millionaire. Buy more than a million BTC and I'd say you have a more secure chance of being a millionaire in 5/10 years, but no guarantee.

The Washington Post, once again proving they don't have real journalists.
@_date: 2015-06-21 22:54:43
Started mining, went on to mine for 6 months. Lost a ton of money, but gained a lot of valuable insight about Bitcoin. Now I leave the mining to the heavy duty players as I sit back and watch this little baby grow.

And I never said that was. But i find entertainment in my investment, sue me.
@_date: 2015-06-14 19:18:54
I agree, a lot of general individuals seem to care less about the potential and real world uses btc can offer. A lot of people see value as simply a monetary thing.
@_date: 2015-06-30 00:14:02
He's right. The point of all the bitcoin noise is so that other European countries can get a jump on it, before they go down a similar route.
@_date: 2018-05-22 01:15:39
Very interesting. Having an easy to use lightning option for merchants eases a lot of confusion and fear for them. Definitely exciting to see where the lightning train is heading.
@_date: 2015-05-15 01:20:17
He explains the protocol so well. 
@_date: 2015-05-22 22:01:57
Oh man, sorry about that haha. Compton is getting a little better now though, with Kendrick Lamar and various other people from compton buying real estate and developing the community from the inside out. There's hope for all =]

If remittance is targeted by the current administration, this could explode much higher.
@_date: 2018-06-19 05:45:41
Cool story. One more for the obituaries.
@_date: 2015-08-03 21:29:37
And slowly one by one they came crashing down....

Best on Reddit.

lol the boy got rekt shorting.
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:17:27
He's in finance, profiting is the name of the game. And say what you want, but fear clearly gets things done in this world.
@_date: 2015-07-16 18:12:12
You're not afraid of economic collapse? I mean sure he's correlating a lot of events, but that doesn't make his mission any less noble. He is telling people to get their money out of the dollar, which is what everyone in this sub has been saying for years.
@_date: 2017-11-22 02:50:54
I wonder if he'll cry on television again when he steers suckers down the drain once more.

It's by the artist Banksy

HYPE! looking forward to see what He Who Must Not Be Named has whipped up.
@_date: 2015-07-11 20:05:18
I digress, I see what you mean.
@_date: 2015-07-16 17:32:34
The word "collapse" shouldn't be abused like this.
@_date: 2015-07-11 19:54:18
Their loss.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:31:48
So you have a superior database?

I like to think Greece can be like a Phoenix. Sure it's burning to the ground(figuratively), but I expect it to eventually come out of these ashes stronger.
@_date: 2015-07-11 19:59:36
If you truly believe in a free market, no need to worry about them not taking on these users. The users themselves will find another way. Bitcoin is very adaptable.
@_date: 2015-07-13 08:01:17
Trust me, the shitstorm has just begun.
@_date: 2015-07-10 21:47:13
As goes with most long-term investments. When its going down, you rely on the "purpose" of bitcoin. When its going up, you celebrate. Human nature my friend.
@_date: 2015-07-20 18:18:59
@_date: 2015-07-13 18:19:33
Along with all the Greece news came an influx of new users who were only in it for the short. Good riddance on getting their weak hands out.
@_date: 2016-09-26 16:32:23
Many people credit the rise to $1200+ because of the Cyprus bailout. Although it could've been the culmination of multiple events in the finance and Geo-political realm.
@_date: 2017-09-08 17:12:17
LOL that's so true. ZH comment section is quite the circle jerk of confirmation bias. 
@_date: 2018-02-27 21:09:12
Statist says statist thing. 
@_date: 2017-10-16 16:18:30
I like Andreas Antonopoulos' rule; to only invest as much as your **understanding** of the the network. The more you understand, the more confident you may be in investing. Or maybe the opposite. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:50:03
Lol cognitive dissonance is quite a drug.

I didn't realize fads could be nearly ten years long. With exponential growth no less.
@_date: 2017-10-31 17:03:52
I commend any effort for normalcy in that region. Those people have suffered enough.
@_date: 2018-07-11 10:49:33
No lightning integration?
@_date: 2018-07-19 14:39:38
He still isn't.
@_date: 2015-09-16 16:17:32
Of all the good news, this is by far my favorite. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:39:56
Wutcha gonna do about it warden Sessions?
@_date: 2015-09-21 16:35:45
Ah makes sense. Well lets say we were to use something like Blockstore, can an off-chain database like that be subject to manipulating the outcome? I only ask, because voting machines are, in my opinion, manipulated here where i live (U.S.)
@_date: 2015-09-21 16:40:40
Oh didn't realize that. Damn, I was really hoping the blockchain could somehow make the voting process more effecient.
@_date: 2015-10-13 21:26:10
*sigh* It's changed around here man.

Create an article and send it to the obituaries.
@_date: 2015-10-17 22:39:33
And don't forget that they are trying to do all of this while simultaneously trying to restrict/ban cash.
@_date: 2017-05-06 18:54:40
It doesn't need to dominate. It just needs to take enough market share that people will see it as a legitimate option. Being that it is superior to the current form of remittance, it should win out naturally.
@_date: 2015-10-17 22:18:15
Negative rates and infinity QE!

I'm anticipating the emergence of OpenBazaar by then. hopefully there'll be an ample amount of items to shop for.

[OpenNode]( has been very easy for me to use. And they have a great promo where you get free processing for a while.

Less than 50 years to service all humans on the planet is not a bad metric by any sense. The dollar has been here for 100+ and it still can not be used everywhere.
PS roger is a dumbass.
