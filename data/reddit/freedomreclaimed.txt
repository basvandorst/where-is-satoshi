Are you sure? I thought it stood for “sinking value”?? Could be wrong though...

Well not personally since I wouldn’t know what I was looking at, but obviously open source would be better.  But after millions of units sold, find me just one article about the company stealing customer funds, just one.

Paxful does. Sending you a pm...

You could always pull the plug until it goes back up. That way your not footing the bill now and not killing off any potential future profits...

Right on. Not sure where you are located but if you have access to US Amazon gift cards, I sell btc for those on Paxful.

Beat me to it. Op, do yourself a favor and get a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 05:39:48
Yea I feel ya man.

If they stole one customers wallet it would destroy their entire business. It just doesn’t make sense. You really trust PayPal? Or you’re messing with me? You gotta be messing with me....

Unfortunately scammers are everywhere. Out of curiosity how much are you looking to pick up?
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:07:38
You could always go buy a gift card and sell for btc.

You could have just asked if open source was preferred and saved yourself a lot of time, lol. I have a Nano, I don’t like the Trezor. I can’t put my finger on exactly why. But I think either is a million times better than an online wallet. I irresponsibly did that for years and am lucky I didn’t lose everything.
@_date: 2019-01-07 05:33:25
Np. Just be careful on there, lots of scammers.
@_date: 2019-01-15 16:49:33
Nope. Was offering to sell him btc.

Paxful offers the ability to pay with skrill. 
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:23:34
There are mods that will help and escrow is used for the coins.

I agree with the lack of transparency in most cases. TrueUSD however seems to be the exception. They were recently audited in August and passed. Good for holding crypto minus the volatility. 
@_date: 2019-01-12 04:54:10
No, only you do.
@_date: 2019-01-12 13:35:12
I’d say it’s a pretty safe bet. I hope you are kidding about PayPal? Paypal can limit your account and freeze your funds at any time. You control your $ with ledger.
@_date: 2019-01-19 07:15:57
Hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-01-14 16:18:52
It’s a peer to peer exchange so just be careful. I sell on there just not for skrill.
