I have to be quite frank here. Bitcoin will NEVER become a widespread everyday used currency that replaces or threatens the existence of modern day national fiat currencies. Due to the hierarchy of money, you live in countries that you must pay taxes to, and until the government accepts crypto, it cannot become le challenge a national currency along with many many other problems such as its limited number of bitcoins. You must have some kind of monetary theory basis to make these claims. Crypto will not disappear and has a place in the financial world just not as a true currency.

I know that this wont be popular opinion. But this is exactly why banks are adopting the blockchain technology behind bitcoin and crypto. They are going to be able to utilize the security and speed and maintain centralization. Bitcoin and a lot of crypto's have a place in the world and the economy, but simply thinking bitcoin can actually become the currency of a state or the globe will not happen. Sovereign currency will always rule supreme as long as there are sovereign states.

Paying taxes doesn't actually pay for these things, it's a way of pulling money out of circulation. The government can pay for whatever the fuck they want, and for the US, they CAN just print more money for a good while before anything drastic or even bad would happen.

Im also an NCAA athlete, so that wouldn't fly but...I understand what you mean and I agree lol and the reason we didn't end up doing it was not because it was at school it was other stuff like funding and what not

but to add to this... our debt DOESN'T matter... we don't need to pay off our debt and when we did actually go into surplus in the early 2000s, i believe, that didn't go so well... so yeah...doesnt matter

They accomplish different things if banks are able to provide payment systems to customers that are multiple times faster than the current status. Bitcoin cannot be used and cannot grow to be the ultimate currency of the US. Sovereign currencies will always reign supreme because at the end of the day, the government has the power to tax you and you CAN'T pay your taxes in BTC. Meaning you will always have to convert back to USD.

you are just incorrect. The blockchain is instant and when blockchain is utilized by private banks, it rapidly speeds up the transaction time. Systems such as high value transfer systems (Wire stransfers) and Low-value batch transfers like the ACH (Automated Clearing House) in the US could be radically changed by blockchain.

do you think that the high level of ignorance could just lead to crypto never becoming mainstream? or with real world implementation of block chain such as in Dubai, people who work with tech companies will eventually come around to it?
