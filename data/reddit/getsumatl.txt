It sounds like their argument is that additional nodes increase concurrency/throughput/storage so roughly equivalent to sharding in traditional distributed/clustered dbms?
My question is more towards how do you achieve high tps performance w a p2p consensus model?  Admittedly I'm not familiar w this product which is why I'm asking in the first place.

Your exclamation mark convinced me..

Curious why you'd pair a nosql dbms which traditionally aims to excel at high tps workloads with a blockchain/distributed consensus framework?  Seems kinda antithetical?

If you actually have something beyond the archives of public mail lists where he discusses infragard conferences and the archive of the isecureu site listing his credentials as infragard member please fwd to me as well.

For a moment take a look at this whole escapade in terms of the parties involved: csw marks the epicenter; then radiating out concentrically you have his tight circle of cronies and business partners/employees; followed by those who have been directly involved in the events of the past few weeks and/or months; after that those who have (indirectly) lent support/credence to the claims csw made; then the skeptics and ultimately debunkers; and finally the loose knit Bitcoin community at large.  One of the more notable patterns that has emerged is the further you get from the center, the less subterfuge, double speak, and leading, flowery rhetoric you encounter in the communications issued by those various groups/parties.  You go from alternately wading through meandering paragraphs of tangential misdirection or intentionally vague, terse, and misleading statements, towards hard facts and undeniable, demonstrable proofs.  The former makes for great theater but does little to lend real credibility to the author and his/her claims.  On the other hand it does leave open room for inference and gives the reader the ability to stray imaginatively from any small truths put forward into realms of complete fantasy.

Lot of random accounts coming forward trying to soften this guys image or cast doubt on the idea he ever claimed to be satoshi. Most are days old or trace back to dec around the time of the 'leak'.

So essentially the blockchain is just acting like the binlogs in a traditional dbms, but stored in perpetuity vs recycled?  All nodes are federated so you never have to worry about bad blocks?  I guess if that's the case I'm not sure what you're achieving w the blockchain layer except adding overhead and paying the associated performance penalties. If on the other hand there is some value in having this p2p consensus layer then the argument goes back to potentially voiding atomic commits in a high tps workload scenario.  Guess I'm still a bit puzzled about this setup but oh well.

Yea but he completely demolished you exposing you as under 16yo.  How will you ever recover...?

Bro no doubt.
