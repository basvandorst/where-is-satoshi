I've withdrawn all my crypto's there meant for trading. The rumours are getting to me and the site feels very unresponsive and slow to load in addition to the many outages lately.

This should get more attention than it has right now. Very valid point. Smart people will be anxiously eyeing the open ledger that BTC is.

I'm not sure either, but one of the factors next to spammers could be artificially inflated transactions prices by miners. Fabrication can also mean different things: fabricated in the sense that miner pools have agreed on a certain tx price or in the sense that miner pools just all jump on a high tx fee bandwagon without consulting with each other which is less 'artificial'.

It's pretty convenient for them to act like they have the updates just ready for the agreed-upon 21st of July. Being one of the two miner pools to now keep BTC from going up may have speculative benefits. But will those benefits weigh up to the potential losses caused by the putative decrease in F2pool's reputability?
TL;DR in cryptos only trust an explanation, motive or intention when it fits with the other party's own interests.

Why are you still here, trolling around? Don't you have anything better to do over at @_date: 2017-07-02 11:46:18
Couldn't agree more. I don't mind the picture that is being used, but I disagree with the way it tries to entice tribalism / polarize over thinking for oneself.

Impressive for 10th grade. I like your analysis of wealth distribution from savers to debtors!

This made me exhale a bit more air through my nostrils than usually.

I'm interpreting this not necessarily as a causal relation, but more as an incentive to buy some deliciously discounted altcoins if this trend holds a while longer.
