i want you to tell my story, i know about bitcoins since 2012 but i never bothered and understood the potential. then in january i  remembered again and found mtgox wanted to buy 500 for 10$ each but didnt want to bother with verification and so on. forgot again. saw bubble in april. started to go in all that cryptothing. never got the idea to buy bitcoins and hold just was using for purchasing stuff. i also believed bitcoin would never reach 300$. never heard of litecoin till around 1 month ago when i also found btce and bought alot of litecoisn for 2$ which i sold again for 3$ not understanding the potential again. rebought sold again and so on and lost most of my litecoins. never understood how to trade . everytime i sold with panic and made loses. one day i had 5 btc left and dont know why but i started to understand how to trade and made 5 bitcoins in one single day. i realized how easy it is and how the whole orderbook is full of manipulation and people are just giving cheap coins with panic selling. once you understand the "system" it feels almost like stealing money.
 i also wanted to buy megacoins when they were 5cents but i couldnt because i had moneyhold in btce. i saw mec raising fast to 2.5$ this week. had a collapse and cried... well i could became millionaire.. my family saw that and started to support me now with some money and building a mining rig. 
i put away some coins in paper wallet for holding gonna build a miner and do someimes daytrading for fun. my advice HOLD and never sell with lose.
