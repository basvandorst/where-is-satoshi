"Not supported" is not the same as "won't work". My UK based debit card worked fine.
I do seriously doubt a non-US bank account will work.
EDIT: This included a conversation with their support which included "Some of our non-US customers have had success linking their credit/debit cards to Circle" so I don't think they oppose it.

I think that would be too confusing for people just on the periphery of bBitcoin. Imagine the stories about how the price crashed by a factor of 1000....

Sheer enormity. But the actual scale of this enormity is much greater than people imagine.

Yes, on September 26th.

I just bought a $10 card which deposited as £6.20 for me without a problem.
