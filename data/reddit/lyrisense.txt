Bitfinex is currently overloaded and busy transitioning out of the US market entirely, so that may account for your lack of support.

Bittrex has a lot of pairs, but like other exchanges has scaled back a few pairs of late. SEC situation has exchanges scrambling for legal advice.
I also recommend Poloniex. I know the company and they seem like reputable people. They also offer a decent number of pairs.

This is truly fascinating. I love that they provided reasons because they are all questionable and highly debatable. As a financial compliance professional and seeing that the letter came from their compliance department), I am very surprised that they didn’t cite a single banking or brokerage compliance rule. I’ll be citing this letter in my research.
Any additional info you can provide regarding future communications you have with them on this topic would be greatly appreciated.

For example, SWIFT. This is an international payment system with literally thousands and thousands of member institutions. Rather than move fiat, a Blockchain token could be utilized, and the system is far wide enough to support a decentralized Blockchain model. There are tons of other use cases for large industries with many players, whether in payments / counterparty situations or for supply chain management. This is all already happening...
@_date: 2017-09-20 18:34:57
Yeah, I completely agree. I feel like learning the crypto space is a bell curve. At first, I didn't understand it all. Then, after a few years (and validated by newbie peers), I felt like an expert. Now, after almost 6 years of being involved in the space, I realize how little I still know or understand. Gotta play it like Socrates: be smart enough to know that you know nothing.
@_date: 2017-09-19 11:53:21
I think for some processes, again such as SWIFT or DTCC, they already don't hold the "keys" and instead would use a Blockchain to disintermediate those existing organizations themselves, with only some level of verification required to join the chain (for DTCC, possibly a broker-dealer registration on file with SEC, etc). If nothing else, firms see Blockchain technology as a massive efficiency play for certain back office and infra-firm processes.
Honestly, I think the larger question is whether governments will be willing to "give up the keys." Bitcoin and it's ilk are not just revolutionary technologically, but also revolutionary for monetary policy and political agency. In a world where individuals can reclaim the freedom to trade and move capital without any interference (or involvement) by the State, the State becomes much less powerful. I view blockchains as incredibly empowering for individuals, and I expect strong pushback and political revolutions in the future focused on this question of agency and capital.
@_date: 2017-09-07 03:05:39
I think you're absolutely right about the sub's fixation with price and memes over quality technical, economic, and academic research discussion.
Another possible factor is that a lot of the crypto-expansion has been driven by the adoption of the technology by private business (including crypto businesses), the fintech industry, and professional and institutional investors, all of whom keep their research, solutions, and strategies confidential. Major consultancies like Deloitte and McKinsey have blockchain practices and big players like IBM and Fidelity (and indeed much of finance and banking sectors as well) are internally working on offerings for bitcoin and/or blockchain services. While this inherently-private industry activity has nonetheless contributed to the rise in bitcoin's price and value, directly and indirectly, the innovations and analyses generated to support that activity isn't being posted here.
But I agree we should all work to raise the quality of dialog both here, and in life.

As someone who handles compliance issues for an extremely large brokerage firm, I can confirm that regulators are extremely stupid, stupid people.

There are myriad ways AI and machine learning can mine information stored on blockchains. Complex systems may analyze data stored on public blockchains, or use Blockchain technology to post results or interact with other machines and systems to collaborate

Also, it’s not like I don’t understand various technical issues or improvement proposals or debates in the communities etc. more like, despite knowing a lot of that, it’s the IMPLICATIONS that I try to wrap my head around: how will governments react to crypto, what are the implications for political agency, for businesses and corporations, how will Blockchain interact with machine learning, etc etc etc. there’s so much there. The more I know and understand, the more questions I have
@_date: 2017-10-04 20:04:11
SSNs should be issued using public/private key cryptography. When asked to certify your identity (such as when opening a bank account), you just give them your public key, and then prove it’s you by interacting with it (such as moving $0.01 or making some entry on the Blockchain with it). Then, when some shitty company like Equifax loses your “SSN,” all they will have lost is your public key, which is already... wait for it... public.

It’s crazy, right? All of a sudden, you look around and all your colleagues and friends are looking to you for comment and education on every crypto development or news story. But then you think deeply about something, and realize how complex the whole thing is.

@_date: 2017-09-19 03:57:04
While I agree completely that centralizing and privatizing a blockchain in many ways undermines the core genius of the technology, my point is that all financial firms are working hard on discovering other uses for Blockchain tech while not necessarily supporting Bitcoin itself. That's common knowledge. I'm not arguing that this is the right approach, just positing that one does not preclude the other.

Dimon is opposed to Bitcoin because he knows EXACTLY how it works
@_date: 2017-09-19 14:36:11
You're asking the right questions, and I'm not an expert in PoS, but remember, in a trusted system - such as within the banking sector or among broker-dealers - there are other incentives to play nice that don't exist in Bitcoin (which is trustless). These inter-firm systems would be run by firms, for firms, specifically to reduce the cost of these operations for all firms involved. But there are still a lot of questions in terms of how this would be implemented, and firms are working on that.

The hardware is basically a two-factor authentication device. You can access the wallet software when the hardware device is connected and unlocked with a code you enter into it directly. But even if you lose the hardware device, they also have a recovery phrase that you can use to restore access to your wallet on a new version of the same hardware device.

Thanks for posting - definitely a good point. This helps people understand why, again, "permissioned" or "closed network" blockchains can be possible. Lots of people looking at this.

@_date: 2017-10-04 23:16:32
Of course accurate - but I’m envision a Blockchain for storing your identity transactions, and subsequently building public reputation which your creditors, banks, etc can confirm by auditing the chain.
@_date: 2017-09-18 21:56:15
Correct. Let's not get crazy here, guys. Calling Bitcoin a fraud while separately working on Blockchain (likely for securities-industry-specific applications, i.e. Settlement and counterparty risk) is not hypocritical, although I strongly disagree with Dimon's comments.
Also, another thing that I know is not en vogue in this sub: Jamie Dimon is absolutely not a stupid man. Neither is El-Erian. But, they ARE wrong when it comes to Bitcoin.

ARK Invest (1st US Public Fund to invest in BTC) has a pretty extensive [research paper]( outlining that there has thus far been zero correlation between BTC price and other asset classes, including equities. But, we haven’t seen BTC during a recession yet. I think it will function as a hedge, but we technically don’t have data to support that yet.

SEC has nothing to do with tax. Unfortunately, in our dumb system, two regulators can take different (and competing) views, which is what we have here between SEC and IRS.
