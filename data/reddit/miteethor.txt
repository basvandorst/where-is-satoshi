Yeah not so much worried about the fraction, it’s getting somebody to take my money.  Perhaps an ATM is the only way at this point.  I’ve been trying for about 5 days now and between site crashes, online verification attempts, waiting for bank accounts to clear it’s just not happening.  Watching this GDAX ticker is beyond frustrating.  Not to jinx anybody but I really need this price to crash again - just 1 more time please so I can buy in once my accounts are working.

So, I’m struggling to even BUY a bitcoin.  Not for lack of trying - Coinbase, GDAX, Kraken, all are stuck trying to verify my account.  Meanwhile the price is going up by the second.  WTF do I need to do to get a bitcoin already!

That's what I'm trying to find out - they've all got pretty web pages that look a lot better than the phishing emails I normally get.  Are these actually happening?

What's up with these forks that are announced for this upcoming week?  
Super Bitcoin, Bitcoin Platinum, Bitcoin Cash Plus, Bitcoin Silver, Bitcoin Uranium, Bitcoin GOD?  Are these for real?  Will I get coins from them if I have my keys?

I have a few questions about these upcoming forks.  According to  there are several happening in the next few days.  I have a small amount in Coinbase already cleared, and some more purchases that I made on Dec 7 that supposedly are stuck in ACH clearing hell until the 14th.  Should I move what I have out now before the fork?  Will I miss out on the Bitcoin Platinum fork on the 12th since Coinbase is holding that purchase?  I have a Ledger Nano S coming but I don’t know if will arrive before the 12, worried that I should transfer what I have to a Paper wallet now?
