Governments have already made their intentions clear that it is unwanted and will want to get rid of it. 
By ènd of 2020 trading it may be illegal. 
I suspect one last run b4 it comes crashing down

Bitcoin will absolutely be regulated. Governments can't have BILLIONS flying around the world unregulated. 
And it is rigged. There was analysis done a while back (sorry no link) where they traced an 88m$ buy. The market went up 15%. That wallet then distributed those coins to 1000's of wallets and than began to sell them. 
If you have huge capital you can pump the price then dump. That's why so much dirty money is flooding into Bitcoin. One it is no longer possible to remain  anonymous those $$ will find something else.

As a commodity trader of 20 years I know when I see the 'fools chasing the rainbow' 
Good luck to you. You WILL lose your money and cause a number of people to also lose money with blind optimism.

Right now Bitcoin is rigged so that a small handful of people can make a large amount of money.
Buy 80m$ of Bitcoin- causes market to react and buy so price shoots up.
Sell 80m$ at high price and market reacts and price plummets.
Repeat. Repeat. 
In the stock market you would go to jail doing this. As soon as Bitcoin is regulated, the party is over and billions upon billions of $ bitcoins will be dumped and it will be worthless with lots of hodls  crying in their mum's basements.
When that happens is anyone's guess, but until then ride the waves and take profits along the way.

The same people telling people to HODL are the ones that are selling.
Your getting scammed folks.

People said that at 10k, 9k, 8k
Buy buy buy. Its on sale.
It's more likely to hit 2k that 10k anytime soon.

Holding a depriciating asset is not smart, it's dumb.
In future stop listening to people telling you to hold.
If you can afford for your investment to go to zero, continue to hold. If not, sell and buy back when the price is lower - which it has a long way to go down.
