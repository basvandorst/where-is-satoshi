My theory was that if people can 'cash out,' then perhaps it would create a market of of players making things to sell on the exchange. I figured we could focus the transactions on peer to peer, not peer to game.

That's more like what I was thinking. Keep all of the crypto in company wallets and just keep track of transactions like every other videogame. Just add in a "cash out" option instead of private wallets for everyone. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:35:47
But how could people pay to win if there's no one selling stuff on the exchange? There would only be a limited number of products. 
As far as dollar vs crypto goes, it technically doesn't make a difference functionally if they're both implemented the way I'm thinking. However, crypto would be more interesting with inflation. I'd basically be trying to set up a mock economy that would mimic the real world, only using crypto. Only way to buy something is if another player produces something.

It's almost like we can have multiple currencies at once. If BTC reaches 1 million, that means that one Satoshi would equal 1¢. That puts the BTC market cap at 21 trillion, which is not a high enough market cap to satisfy the demand for money alone. Altcoins such as LTC can help fill this demand as well as tailor to different market groups (ie, security, quick/cheap transactions, moving large quantities, etc).
Alternatively, 10 million per BTC would put the price of one Satoshi at 10¢ with a 210 trillion market cap. Having the smallest unit be 10¢ is not small enough to adequately serve small or precise transactions. Altcoins could help fill this gap as well.
Even if an altcoin became the dominant coin, BTC and/or other altcoins would still have to fill one of the above gaps for cryptocurrency to dominate the vast majority of the markets. 
Case three is BTC, Altcoins, and Fiat all coexist simultaneously in the same market.

My brother. He was always a PC nerd. It's because of him that I knew about lots of things computer related. We both actually learned about bitcoin before we were on Reddit. I'll have to ask him where he first learned about it. 
Looking back, him ranting and raving about people becoming millionaires would have been when BTC peaked around $30usd in July 2011 before falling back down. 
Edit: Due to my general laziness, I never got into Bitcoin until this year even though I planned on investing in it for a few years.

If you invest $500, you'll quite possibly have a couple grand in a few months. If you invest $100, you can buy a PS4 in a few months. 
Easiest site to use is Coinbase. You can buy Bitcoins with a credit/debit card at a 4% fee. You can keep your coins with them (like a bank account) until you feel comfortable/knowledgeable enough to transfer it to your own wallet. 
So a bubble is kind of what it sounds like. It means that the price is over inflated for the market. Right now, one BTC is ~$19k. Some people feel that that's way too high for what it is. However, tons of people feel that it's way undervalued, so the price keeps driving upwards. When too many people feel it's overvalued, they'll start to sell it, causing the price will drop. This drop can convince others to cash out to minimize loss, potentially causing a chain reaction. If this chain reaction is substantial enough, it will be considered a crash. If the effects are long term, then the bubble will be considered popped. 
Go to  and look at the "all" chart. You can see that November 2013, it peaked around $1000 before crashing. About one year later, Bitcoin lost ~75% of its value. This could be considered a bubble popping. It's worth noting that just because a bubble pops, it doesn't mean it won't come back stronger than before. Look at Amazon's stock for example. It peaked around $100 in 1999 before loosing 90% of it's value. Now it's over $1000. 
If Bitcoin crashed like it did in 2013, it would drop from $19k to $15k in a few weeks. Then it would steadily decrease before it bottoms out around $5000. Then after a year or two, Bitcoin will be at $19k again and steadily increase again. The question isn't if? The question is when and how bad? It could crash next week, or it could be in a year when it's worth $500k. How bad will it be? It could loose 50% of it's value and last a few months or it could loose over 80% and last a few years. 
Me personally, I believe we have a way to go before the bubble pops. More and more people are talking about and learning about Bitcoin, which brings in a lot more money. If I were a betting man, I'd wager that we need to tack on an extra zero before any bubble pops, *but* that is just my own opinion and no one knows for certain.

Gdax is owned and operated by Coinbase. You can log into Gdax with your Coinbase credentials and you can move money freely between them without costing you anything. Although owned by the same entity, Gdax has lower fees than Coinbase.  Due to this, it's recommended to transfer your coins to Gdax for free, them send it to whatever account/wallet you want.

Absolutely. I may have missed the "get rich off of $100," but that doesn't mean I can't invest in it still. ETH and LTC have doubled in price this past week and it's not impossible that they'll close the price gap between them and BTC, currently worth .042BTC and .017BTC respectively. Then there's Ripple, which has tripled to $0.80USD in the past week. I need to invest a couple hundred or so in that just in case it shoots up in price. Most of my coins will still be held in BTC since I feel it's still the safest option and is the pioneer coin. 


I agree. Cryptocurrency is nowhere near what it will be. Although Bitcoin has a special place, I don't believe it can exist as the sole currency of the world due to limited supply and divisibility ([see another comment of mine here]( Basically BTC market cap would be to small to meet the worlds demand, or one Satoshi would equal more than 1¢. Either way, BTC would have to be supplemented with another currency. 
P.S. While typing this, I had the thought of the US issuing dollar bills that say ["one dollar in Bitcoin payable to the bearer on demand"](
