For RBF, I see several other comments asking for RBF - I disagree and would like to voice my opinion that I would like it left out.  I believe it increases likelihood that fees escalate / become unpredictable and leads to a net user experience that is worse than a system without RBF.

I think the general concern is about balance.  If all the base BTC layer does is support LN channels being opened and closed, then Bitcoin isn't really accessible.  And it might be that LN hubs perform functions very similar to banks in that case - to a level that is beyond acceptable.  However, LN being optional for some use cases (which don't preclude most other uses) is just one more tool in the toolbox.
Take for example, if I stop at the corner store for odds and ends every day, it would be nice to open a payment channel with them.  I know them somewhat personally, it is a frequent and regular usage, they likely have little incentive or ability to "control a monetary supply" (even if that only means restricting access).
On the other hand, IF (this is theoretical and only to illustrate the other side of the spectrum) I have to deposit $5000 (at $30 or $300 opening and closing fee) in a payment channel with the future equivalent of Visa / Discover so that I can have access to all of their other connected channels, how is that tenable?

I quite well understand the arguments around 2x.  I think you're entirely missing my point...  Crypto is fledgeling tech that has obvious benefits to many people.  In no way are hardly any of the projects in this space "meeting their demise", much less bch.  By many measures its the fastest growing crypto out there if you count it as it's own project.  Transaction count, merchant/exchange acceptance, market cap, mining reward/network security.  Surely all of that is due to proximity to Bitcoin, but it is regardless growing incredibly fast.
That said, the better point is that I'm not bch cult - I'm cryptocurrency cult since 2012.  I'm more interested in solutions to problems than playing sides.

I really wish this post had a different tone.  There's been such animosity towards anyone that wanted a blocksize increase because "attack" or "takeover" or anything other than predicting the point we're at today.  This post could be taken as, "You know, maybe there is something wrong with keeping the blocksize at 1MB if we don't have a definite plan (timeline) for other scaling solutions".
At least from my personal standpoint (and I've heard many other people say it too), we're not ignorant to think that infinite adoption is as simple as having infinite blocksize.  (yes, it is proposed that market economics could control actual blocksize without having a protocol enforced limit - it's a good debate if you have time for it).  A lot of it has to do with priorities and allowing the Bitcoin network effect to survive long enough for other, more permanent scaling solutions to be implemented.
Being told for months / years that we don't care about the fundamentals of Bitcoin / decentralization and that we're just money grabbing idiots has been frustrating.  Frustrating enough for many that they found other avenues to capture the ideals that originally excited us in Bitcoin.
Maybe in a little bit of summary, I'd talk about some leadership class training I had.  The exercise was along the lines of "In what world can I create a framework where that person's actions make sense".  If some guy seems antisocial, maybe it's because he's been conditioned that way.  If someone is following Roger Ver's philosophy on cryptocurrency, why would that make sense.  It's a bit of an exercise on helping establish an understanding that leads to productive discussion rather than increasing barriers.

So when Core eventually talks about increasing the blocksize limit through a hard-fork, are we going to be calling that hypocrisy?  I don't think so.  They are alternate scaling plans.

I think you're asking for a distinction that doesn't need to be made.  Bitcoin isn't under any individual's control where there is a direct "plan" to be written down.  When I read wiki articles that refer to 


it implies larger blocks.
When the original developer had an intention for a block limit that didn't come from an economic basis and gave a proposal (plan?) for modification of that limit, it implies larger blocks.  When we have over two years discussion about degree of increase and logistics of an increase, it implies a plan.

I don't think the "O" scenario is the only part that should be considered.  Between 1MB blocks and 1GB blocks, I don't think there will be linear growth over that whole period.  So, it could be O(n) and be o(n^2 ) for the next few years (see my reply to greenearplugs below).
Both situations could be considered.  Perhaps 20MB or 100MB blocks would be needed in a relatively short term.  That doesn't necessarily mean that we would need 1TB blocks in the long term (as o approaches O).
Restated, I can envision short-term requirements for quick scaling.  However, I don't think that means bitcoin requires infinite scaling or scaling that outpaces hardware scaling.

By most measures, yep.  Not really saying anything about that.  I just think a 95% consensus mechanism isn't going to often be practical.

While that may be true now, I'm not sure that will stay true in the mid-term (say 5-10 years from now).  Although I own bitcoin and regularly think about using them, it has yet to impact my daily life.

Should we stop pushing bitcoin at all because - someone deleted their wallet file, it was corrupted, they sent coins to an unspendable wallet, they forgot their password, man in the middle attack, price dropped after they bought them?
Coinbase is one company fitting a specific role - not a perfect solution for everything.  So far seems relatively safe to store coins on and have some chance of customer service.  Don't expect every trade to go through quickly and do expect some things to get reversed.  Also expect to give them lots of data about your person and finances.

Not quite the same thing, but I see your point.  If it's a clear improvement to the system, it's probably going to get implemented.  You could even restate that to - it won't get implemented unless it's a clear improvement to the system.  Not too bad, but doesn't make any allowance for tough decisions.
I wonder what would happen for block size if the situation was reversed - no current enforced limit and someone was proposing a limit enforcement.
FYI, it also doesn't seem robust that any 51% "attack" (just say any BIP only requested 51% consensus) will succeed, but just because I want it my way I'm going to tell you it must be 95%.  The system that we're all using really only requires 51% whether we like it or not.

Which is exactly the reason I can't believe anyone is truly putting any faith in LN improvements within even a couple years.  It's uncoded as of today.  Even then, forget about real-world testing being relevant for quite some time.  Then you're asking merchants to also create working integration with whatever multitude of payment systems already exist.
Reading on LN, even experienced people have a hard time understanding and explaining how it is SUPPOSED to work, much less have time to creatively search for attack vectors in both technical and economic realms.  Bitcoin is over 6 years old and has a much less complex implementation.  It's simply not realistic to expect LN to have any reasonable impact on the greater Bitcoin world within a couple years.
I don't understand the disparity in a person's belief (perhaps many people on that a bitcoin hard-fork is "RISKY" and "Potentially Damaging" to the bitcoin eco-system, yet still propose LN and all of the uncertainty around it as any type of possible alternative at this point.
@_date: 2014-10-25 01:28:09
You could know WHEN you would win a block, but not necessarily that you will - you could prehash a bunch (using current time and incrementing up), but you can't submit that successful block solution until you are within an acceptable range of time.  So, if you found a solution to the function hash(time,previous block)*coinage&lt;difficulty where the time is Nov 5, 2018 16:30:24, it's not like you could submit that solution now.  Even if you found a potential solution 6 hours from now, you can't submit it.  And then if you find a solution that's acceptable within the next few minutes, yes, you can submit this solution and expect to be rewarded with the next block.
However, that's not a reasonable attack vector.  You only have one PoS block under control.  You might as well say that finding a successful PoW solution means you know you have won the next PoW block....so what?  You have to have a means of controlling the next 6 successful blocks.
So here, in a alternating system you are prevented from extending that chain.  Say you had enough coinstake to realize you would be successful in the next 6 PoS blocks.  After your first PoS block, the network enforces a PoW block to be found before allowing a second PoS block.  Reasonably, the PoS block finder / attacker doesn't also have PoW control.  So the next PoW block modifies the blockchain and changes all future PoS / PoW hashes.  What was previously determined to be a second successful PoS block has now been modified and has less chance of success.

I'd generally agree that it's a good idea to please as many people as reasonable, but I think several things stand against reaching unanimity:
1 - The "core" code was / is controlled by one person for a long time.  Without competing implementations, this is effectively governing everything through that one person.  Going from that position to 95% of the bitcoin population is a drastic flip.
2 - This 1MB blocksize isn't in the original white paper and wasn't part of the system intent.  That specific numerical limit was not implemented with any consensus mechanism other than point 1.
3 - Nothing makes any members of the bitcoin community specifically qualified to make any judgement about the technicalities of these changes.  Nothing makes them specifically qualified to resist change either.  I'd think that no change that reaches any level of discussion will be passed by a 95% vote of a large population.  If it even reaches the point of discussion, more than 5% of the population will disagree just based on human nature.  Those cases where a 95% consensus is reached are because they didn't reach a conscious level of debate.
4 - Entire governmental systems are ran by consensus processes that follow less than unanimity.  These systems represent quite a bit of history and human development and certainly more than $5.5 billion.  The very simple fact that governments exist shows that a very small subset of the entire population is allowed to make decisions to guide the behavior of larger population.
5 - Disregarding anything we think SHOULD happen, if a majority (&gt;50%) of the bitcoin network decides to change the rules of the network, it IS effectively changed.

It means that a 51% attacker would need to have both 51% hashing power from PoW side as well as a 51% "stake" power from the PoS side.  In order to have the 51% "stake" power, the attacker would have to have very many coins as well as have them sitting around inactive for a period of time (say &gt;30 days as in PPC).
Additionally, any "stake" power that person has is destroyed / consumed by initiating the attack (coin-age resets to 0 when it is involved in a block reward or any transaction).  PoS is generally considered more resistant to majority attack (probably an order of magnitude more even).
As mentioned, this doesn't make it the best "proof" system.  It is resistant to some attack vectors while PoW is resistant to others.  Combine the two to prevent weaknesses in each one, I say.

Most commonly, a paper wallet is imported into an internet connected PC in order to perform a transaction.  This can be unconnected from the armory wallet created on the offline PC.
So, say I had 100BTC in an offline wallet.  To get the money out of that offline wallet, I import the private key to Bitcoin-QT on a liveCD version of Ubuntu.  After transferring 10BTC for the transaction I'm interested in, I power down the PC.  What you don't realize, is that the other 90BTC didn't stay in the original public address.  It was sent to a newly created change address - something Bitcoin-QT does (or at least did in older versions) automatically kinda behind the scenes.  Unfortunately, the private key for the change address doesn't get stored anywhere in this scenario and the 90BTC are essentially lost.
There's other versions of this story, but it's mostly from the use of paper wallets being disconnected from the use of the online wallet.  Or it's related to the fact that default behavior of some wallets is to clear out all funds associated with a public address and send any remainder to a "change" address.  Either way, a good point to note when using offline methods of storing funds.

You don't "Know you won a block", you "know you have a solution".  If you provide that solution before someone else, then you win a block.  There's no set timeframe between blocks, only whether you can provide a solution before someone else does.  You have absolutely no way of knowing how long that will be.


Of course, that's like saying "every time I win, I win".  Point is, no difference for PoW vs PoS as it comes to Finney attack.
@_date: 2014-10-24 14:25:21
Someone with a 0.1% of the stack has a 0.1% chance to win the next block - not 100%.  For PoW in bitcoin, the computation for the miner is hash(nonce)&lt;difficulty.
It's hard to find details on the Peercoin version of PoS, but my memory is that it's [leading zeros from coinstake + hash(PCClockTime in seconds)]&lt;difficulty.  The "magic" of PoS doesn't come only from the coinstake but also from its usage of clocktime.

PoW = proof of work.  This means that a computer (or ASIC) has to do a bunch of work (math) in order to update the blockchain.  It's how all of the bitcoin transactions are recorded.
51% means that a single person / group has a controlling portion of the computational power on the bitcoin network.  This makes them able to do [certain things]( to the bitcoin network.  It's not the end of the world, but is certainly concerning to many people using Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-23 22:27:05
PoS is no more weak to a Finney attack than PoW.  In both cases, a miner has to have some assurance that his version of the blockchain will be accepted by the network.  In PoW, this comes from controlling the majority of the hashing power.  In PoS, this comes from controlling the majority "stake" (most often coin-age).  In either case, the miner has to maintain control for long enough that his transactions are sufficiently confirmed (typically thought of as 6 blocks / an hour).
In the proposed alternating system, the miner / attacker would have to control both the hashing power and the stake for a sufficient duration.  For the established bitcoin network (hash power) and cost base (market cap or $/coin), this means quite significant cost of mining hardware as well as investment in acquiring coins.  Even were a person to establish this controlling position, he'd be doubly incentivized to maintain the integrity of the bitcoin network.

It's not as simple or clear-cut as that.  Web browsers, ecommerce, and other internet activities existed in the early 90s.  Some of the reason it "magically reached mass adoption" was (a prime example of) [network effect](  Surely, there were some technical advances along the way (data speeds, flash, youtube) as well.
So, the "unnecessary" portion of your statement becomes less valid due to network effect.
This may be partially true for the "confusing" portion (as people go from "WTH is bitcoin" to "Hm, my friend bought a new computer at Newegg with bitcoin, neat"), but will also need some technical advances as well.

In either system, when a miner has found a solution to a block, they only have a short window to submit that solution.  It's not like PoS lets you know that you will have a solution to a block in 6 months and give you time to plan this Finney attack.  You only know that you COULD have a solution in 6 months if there were NO updates to the blockchain in the intervening time.  Both PoS and PoW hash functions require the previous blocks / blockchain in the hash function.  Therefore, any solution I find now becomes invalid the minute another block is submitted to the chain.
Both PoS and PoW have adjusted difficulty such that your odds of finding a block are based on time.  So for either one, your odds of having a successful solution and being able to execute a Finney attack are based on your relative control of the "Proof" power divided by time.  Neither of the systems are more likely execute a Finney attack than the other one.  Of course, neither is less likely either.

I've proposed a split for the PoW / PoS alternating system that wouldn't change the PoW reward - no reason to disrupt the infrastructure if we don't need to - PoW, 5 minutes, PoS, 5 minutes PoW.  PoS takes so little effort to do, it might not even need a reward system.
This would also mean there's no decrease in PoW blocks.
Not to be argumentative, but to make sure the point isn't missed - even a decrease in PoW blocks doesn't translate straight to a decrease in security.  2 security layers with 50% strength are often more secure than 1 layer at 100%.  (Hopefully the meaning comes across there).
@_date: 2014-10-21 21:27:32
I tend agree that PoS has flaws, but don't agree with Gavin's past dismissal of PoW flaws as it relates to 51% attack.  I have seen some hybrid systems in the past, but those are mostly only done for an expected duration; i.e. PoW/hybrid to create the coins, then PoW turned off after some time period.  Alternate proposals for deterministic PoS or time-delayed PoS go a bit further into securing the blockchain, but still have weaknesses as pointed out by others in the past.
I'd still recommend a specifically alternating PoS / PoW blockchain (whether altcoin or hard-fork to Bitcoin) that would safeguard the weaknesses of each system.   PoS needs protection from the "nothing-at-stake" scenario and is a great candidate to have PoW as a backup.  PoW needs protection from a 51% attack and is a great candidate to have PoS add randomization as a backup.
I think a specifically alternating selection of PoS block then PoW block is key to this idea.  I've written a bit more on this before at [LINK](
@_date: 2014-06-15 19:25:09
To my knowledge, there aren't any proposals that specify alternating between systems which would do a better job guaranteeing that neither system can achieve even short-term control of the blockchain.
In particular, PPC is using PoW for creation of coins - but plans for the long term situation to remove all PoW at some distant point in the future.

Enact a new rule that is stricter than the previous rule set.  Imagining a situation where the non-mining and mining community were at odds, the non-mining community can exclude any (all?) non-compliant miners from their ecosystem.

So shouldn't we be asking for tech to speed up initial usage?  SPV mode until everything is downloaded and verified.  Or "download blocks that I'm interested in". Polling multiple nodes to verify output spend status.
Do you mind giving a direct answer to the second question?  We can see that node count isn't really increasing.  Initial blockchain download isn't even a factor if there are never any new nodes so perhaps we should segregate the problems.  1. When does blocksize increase cost for current nodes?  2. How do we increase node count?

1) Splitting a transaction is going to increase the overall size of the transaction.  Since fees are actually paid in btc / transaction size (something like 0.001mBTC / kB today), this would make splitting the transaction require larger fees for the same processing time.
2)  If people pay the target fee, that's great.  If they instead see that blocks have open space and they don't need to pay even a 0.25% fee, then a rational person would decrease their fee.  Then, at the next block adjustment, the network would see that fees went down and therefore decrease the max block size.  Hopefully, it's evident that this can make blocksize follow supply and demand economics.
Perhaps I / we should stop talking about fee as a % and instead use the standard BTC / kB structure that the network actually uses.  That seems to work because it links fee more directly to work that miners do ("Hey, I know a block is 10MB and it's going to cost 10BTC to create that block").  However, it has its own risk that network security doesn't scale with transaction volume.  Outside of bitcoin, it wouldn't make sense to charge insurance by the size of a car - rather we charge insurance by the value of the car.
@_date: 2017-02-22 23:32:59
"Can" is fairly open ended. Someone could try to maintain a connection to every node on the network and use much more data.
For my own standpoint, my home Internet usage is ~30GB / day with most of that coming from entertainment during evening hours. I could probably tolerate 4x that much average download per day in off hours.  That's roughly equivalent to 800MB blocks (And would require &lt;10% of my rated bandwidth).  Upload speed is lower, so maybe I'd say around 100MB blocks are tolerable.
That's quite extreme, but it shows an order of magnitude for what we are talking about be able to handle AT NO EXTRA cost to me.
As I invited, feel free to include your own numbers and talk about data caps if you like.  We should each be making these decisions in light of our own capabilities and understand the tradeoff.
Fwiw, $0.50 transactions aren't hindering much of my use of bitcoin either.

I gotta say I love your reply :)
Nodes useful to the network - miners.  Other full nodes have some use as being archival in nature (if they aren't pruned).
I'm on the fence about any other nodes being useful to the network.  On one hand, proof of work was invented because there are too many other ways to falsify participation in the network.  On the other hand, there are so few mining groups that I have a hard time calling Bitcoin decentralized without acknowledging non-miner "enforcement" of network policy.  Your thoughts here?
A full node with pruning and no connections is personally useful, but has little value to the rest of the network.  I do still say I would like this functionality built in to lite wallets - point them to my home node as the preferred data source.  (assuming there isn't some way to snoop / spoof this data connection).
@_date: 2015-05-08 00:18:09
I think there's an error in either end of the discussion from what I've seen.  1) Fixed blocks at 1MB or any arbitrary (even if it's adjusted on a regular basis) will limit adoption.  2) Infinite (or just plain too large) of a block will work for now as long as there is a subsidy to miners.  Turn that subsidy off (or perhaps just halving it), and we have less incentive to mine / secure the blockchain.
If we have intelligent people demonstrating ways to analyze the block and determine fees so that you can estimate how long it will take your transaction to get included, then let's turn that analysis the other way around - determine what block size allows for transactions to balance usage and fees.
Something along these lines:  I want the average transaction to pay ~0.25% in fees (cheap, but now it's my turn for arbitrary:) ).  During the last 2016 blocks, capped block size was 10MB and bitcoin users paid 0.30%fees.  For the next 2016 blocks the capped block size goes up by 20% to 12MB.
Related to this, perhaps I only think miners need a total reward of 0.25%.  Right now, the block reward is ~2% by itself.  That seems to say that we don't need a fee market yet and that we should just increase block size until more adoption (more transactions) occurs.  That's a fairly good argument for just increasing the reward to 20MB for now and giving someone time to work out the mechanics of fee balancing.

Do you understand that word choice conveys more than direct meaning?  Perhaps I should put it straight and tell you that it does sound like you are pretty much calling me a dimwit - mostly after I asked a question at that.
I do understand that SegWit does not violate current "script predicates of a transaction regarding witness data".  Is there any mechanism in the proposed Segwit softfork that creates a script to allow transactions without private keys from the point of view of non-segwit nodes?  Or rephrased - Bitcoin allows for the creation of outputs that can be respent without private keys.  If I use a non-segwit node, will segwit transactions use that technique?
As a separate subject - Byzantine General's solution.  The solution was to use a proof of work system to enforce sequence and validity rules to all transactions on the network. To be enforced, those rules would not require any external system of consensus.  In fact, external collusion (regardless of good / selfish intent) is sometimes regarded as an attack on the network.  We now have a signalling system within the bitcoin network that allows for separate parties to "collude" to change the rules of the network (be that through a soft or a hard fork).  For clarity, does that qualify to you as a new consensus mechanism that is "not Bitcoin"?  Or rather, when you say "if Satoshi's solution to the Byzantine General's problem is "un-solved" and replaced with some new consensus mechanism" are you only speaking of the algorithm by which "work" is shown (or perhaps other "proof" systems)?

Blocksize and mining should be and are inherently tied together.  
If we have intelligent people demonstrating ways to analyze the block and determine fees so that you can estimate how long it will take your transaction to get included, then let's turn that analysis the other way around - determine what block size allows for transactions to balance usage and fees.
Something along these lines: I want the average transaction to pay ~0.25% in fees. During the last 2016 blocks, capped block size was 10MB and bitcoin users paid 0.30%fees. For the next 2016 blocks the capped block size goes up by 20% to 12MB to allow more room to bring the fees down.
Related to this, perhaps I only think miners need a total reward of 0.25%. Right now, the block reward is ~2% by itself. That seems to say that we don't need a fee market yet and that we should just increase block size until more adoption (more transactions) occurs.

Don't get me wrong, other scaling efforts are great - pruning nodes if you want to, leveling the load on bandwidth through improvements in transaction / block communication methods, changes to signature verification.  Those types of things deserve way more discussion than blocksize limits.  It's truly disappointing that the community has been divided and derailed by this seemingly non-issue.

Founders getting rich from something they create doesn't make it a scam either.  That's like saying Microsoft if a scam just cuz Bill Gates got rich.
Each altcoin should be personally evaluated to see if it offers significant advantages over existing payment / currency channels.  Resistance to a 51% attack may be "valuable" to some people.  Litecoin (and some other coins as well) was an attempt to be ASIC resistant - it's particular implementation didn't do too well on that in my opinion.  Overall inflationary monetary policy embeded in a coin may be beneficial to some people as well.

His post says "schedule" and not "limit" as you've reworded it.  I'd say you and Gavin agree on that point.


So what's the scoop with SegWit transactions?  I read disagreement on this "anyone can spend" point?  Is it true that old nodes will not check SegWit transactions against private keys (as you've stated shouldn't be "Bitcoin")?


Isn't any upgrade mechanism (softfork or hardfork) that attempts to alter the PoW mechanism not "Bitcoin".  So, signalling for capabilities and/or waiting for 75% or 95% thresholds try to "un-solve" Satoshi's solution?

Perhaps it is rather a serious impediment to understanding what a thing *could* be.
Perhaps we should start with only very few conditions on what properties Bitcoin *must* have and then begin with what properties bitcoin must *not* have?  For instance, I would agree that "Bitcoin" must not use a new genesis block.  However, just because a cryptocurrency does use the same genesis block, it does not have to be "Bitcoin".
I would not say that bitcoin MUST have the 21 million coin schedule.  It is a valuable property to have a low and regular schedule of issuance, but for my expected lifetime it will be inflationary in supply.  What should I care if it were to continue indefinitely?  (perhaps only renewing coins that have been "lost" or perhaps only at 0.1% per year or something).
I'm a little on the side-line about the PoW thing.  On one hand, other "proof" systems could be just as valid as the "double-SHA256-proof-of-work", but they are likely significantly different in nature.  I could see another cryptocurrency as potentially having a more secure "proof" system (and that system could even extend the current bitcoin blockchain), but it would not be "Bitcoin" by its nature.
FWIW, I would say that words are our neither our masters or our slaves - they ARE us.  
@_date: 2017-02-07 22:22:32


Agreed.  Bitcoin already allows an output that can be respent without a private key.  This is contrary to what you originally said:


So, perhaps no one uses that today because it would understandably be stolen.  However, I believe SegWit makes broad use of that technique (from the point of view of non-segwit nodes).  I am not entirely certain of that.




I'm not confusing them, I'm asking which one you care about.  If the first, we should all participate in a system where broadcast "voting" is not done, yes?  Or perhaps voting is allowed but the only meaningful threshold is majority?
If the second, it is the Proof of Work system and the algorithm itself should not be modified.  Or perhaps any proof of work system is allowed as long as it stays proof of work and not proof of "anything else".

My knowledge might not be entirely complete here, but Litecoin came around when BTC was approaching ASICs.  An attempt to keep mining spread to as many people as possible seems like a pretty good idea to me.
Proof of Stake is another attempt to do that as well - a much better attempt than script mining in my opinion.  Peercoin was the first to do that, yet still has PoW even today.  NXT was the first coin to go all the way Proof of Stake.  I agree that it gets a little cloudy with NXT - is premine an inherent issue with PoS or was it a developer trick to get rich.  I haven't kept up with the history here, but I would think time would prove that out.  Does the developer still work on NXT or what?
And for what it's worth, I'm not trying to be difficult here - I just don't think two of those coins are that much of a scam.  There are, however, several hundred other coins that I would include as scams.  In fact, I think that opinion is (or should be) shared by so many people that nobody should bother attempting to create another coin.  It's more likely to work if we modify / adapt an existing major player with any improvement ideas even if they would be hard to implement.

Not to be argumentative, but including those projects in your support against a vaporware claim isn't all that supportive.
Perhaps even more to the point, just having a project listed on Git isn't much proof that a protocol has been implemented.  Does anyone use this "in production with real bitcoin"?

What you seem to be suggesting is that there is a mathematical formula that relates blocksize limit to "decentralization".  Regardless of your stance on what this limit should be, I don't understand how you can call this a "technical parameter".  It's not like we can say blocks &gt;1.1 MB means there is no more decentralization or even "0.5 decentralizations".  Then, even if you could, that relationship is only good for one point in time as hardware / software technology changes.  That's precisely the reason this debate is so drawn out.

It looks like Segwit actually transitions to a different block limit - a new measure called "block cost".  I'm not exactly clear if the old Blocksize Limit will stay or be removed...removal would seem appropriate to me, but I think that only occurs in the hard fork version of Segwit.  Can anyone clarify for my?
In any case, I think the actual point is that there is a general opinion that a hard fork will be required at some point.  (consensus?  That word has little meaning to me now)  Although core's roadmap indicates the possibility or even the eventual plan a hardfork, it's not yet IN the plan.  Perhaps could have written 4) ...Core's plan (do everything other than hardfork).

Miners don't "set" the rules.  They propose rules by transmitting blocks and the rest of the network either agrees or rejects those rules.
Somewhat key to that 1. no hard-fork rule change can be implemented by anyone who is not mining.  2. Non-mining nodes could enforce a soft-fork on the mining community.

Under a POW system, the "rest of the economy" doesn't really count / matter.  I understand what you're talking about, but the current form of Bitcoin doesn't have any means to account for that.  You're asking for redistribution of mining hardware, a different proof system, or a social means of controlling voting / forks...
Anyway, that's a little bit of a technicality re:OP.  Garzik's only referring to the definition of altcoin / bitcoin, not the mechanism of a fork within bitcoin (I'll acknowledge that the mechanism is partially involved in determination of status).  More so, he's talking about that discussion (which could also cover discussion about an appropriate mechanism).

Luke's proposal with some tweaks is not "Luke's proposal".  Otherwise, we can say Luke's proposal is just a variation of several earlier proposals (BIP103 even reaching BIP stage).  Since they are distinct and since you did ask above, I consider Luke's the worst.
Voluntarily decreasing transaction capacity by 70% at this point in time would surely cause quite a bit of media attention and would be like a scouring pad for the entire community - removing all but the die-hard believers in this individual piece of code.  It would severely remove Bitcoin's "first mover" advantage (and potentially all of the security provided by an extensive mining network) and open the door to any cryptocurrency that has had the advantage of being developed recently.  Those other cryptos have several other advantages - benefit from all of Bitcoin's learnings, smaller communities with less resistance to change, undivided communities.
While that proposal might be the worst for Bitcoin, I'm still a firm believer in crypto in general.  *Overall*, Luke's proposal might cause a revolution that is worth living through if it strengthen's the final product if that means transitioning blockchains.

I believe that Bitcoin offers several fundamental advantages to current fiat system - enough to become interested in and begin to experiment the system.  It does, of course, also have some disadvantages today (current lack of userbase and scalability namely).
It was the advantages that made me start using it, so I'll list some to answer your question:
1 - Ability to safely, and without the requirement of a middleman, transact either small or large sums of funds.  It doesn't remove the middleman, just helps remove the requirement.
2 - The long-term stability of the overall inflation rate holds some fundamental interest to me.
3 - As an open-source project, it was cool to participate and learn about in the early days.
4 - Investment potential at the early stage of the game.
Assuming adoption grew, I was looking at it from the other side - what advantages does fiat have over Bitcoin?  I still don't see too many.

It's been a while since I've looked into this, but Peercoin's PoS was like
find n so hash(trans+n+timestamp)&lt;target*coinage and get coins or transaction fees, make target more difficult if this goes to fast.
Timestamp is rounded to seconds to make the computational effort minimal.
However, there are several other flavors of PoS - lottery based on unspent outputs to pick an individual or a group of possible individuals, the coinage multiplier may be different, coinage may be limited or unlimited, it's general combined with PoW in some form.

From a network capacity standpoint, Segwit isn't really a more efficient use of resources - it's more of a change in accounting.
It's like I've got a highway where I'm only allowed to pass 4 cars per second.  Someone comes along and says we're getting close to that limit, let's only count blue cars.  All other colors we'll count as 1/4th of a car.
While it does help us pass this counting rule, it doesn't do these things:
-Make the cars smaller.
-Make the road bigger.

I'd guess (perhaps naively) that the overall bandwidth performance of the entire planet if following some predictable growth pattern.  Nielsen's "Law" is perhaps a good basic model but perhaps not necessarily inclusive.
While there may be areas that have fiber installed, there are also areas that have not had any internet (or still don't).  I have coworkers from India that have families in such situation.  Just 5 years ago, their community cooperatively had their first phone installation...then 3 years after that, cell technology is putting high speed internet connections in almost everyone's hand.  While obviously anecdotal, it points to the other side of your example.
Likewise, data processing for the communication equipment can be as important as the media as well.
And somewhat futuristicaly, there's active research into layered signals within photon matrices or even in communication through quantum entanglement...hard to see what future tech will enable far down the road, just some minor assurance that we don't see a hard end of the road just yet.

A blocksize limit hardfork is mentioned in your bitcoin-dev post, but isn't really listed on the current versions of the [roadmap](  Rather, it's more a discussion on why not to do one now.

It's an interesting video, but it's it's only loosely applicable to SegWit.  A large concern with increasing blocksize limit was network centralization due to the great firewall and burst data requirements.  SeqWit doesn't help that.  Unlike the video, it doesn't actually change the FLOW characteristics of the transactions.
IBLT (or other changes to block propagation methods), a difference in time between blocks, transaction Muxing, compression, or something similar is more akin to what is in the video.
SegWit has advantages, yes.  It's just not "efficiency" or "capacity".  Truthfully, it's a nifty little (accounting) trick to avoid a hardfork for a while.  So yeah, it could turn a bad situation into a complete success.
@_date: 2017-03-13 20:42:44
So we've had several years to go through this discussion and none of our "core" devs have come up with a better solution?
Surely the plethora of "core" devs compared to other small dev teams and untested code; the very wide economic support for SegWit due to maleability fix, increased transactions due to larger block weight with enhanced economic incentives for signatures, ease of implementation in third-party wallets, enabling of Lightning type protocols, security due to high deployment threshold; miners enjoying a "Fee Market" due to restricted block size (who wouldn't want increased profit); publicized failures of the opposing team on technical and social basis; status as incumbent and general inertia in technological change; blah blah blah... Surely all of these things would suppress hostile or contentious attempts for this type of change?
I mean, I'm happy to let Bitcoin do its thing - It can stay secure while the debate continues and not change.  It can upgrade following an honest and supported path to increased throughput (does anyone truly understand cost / risk reduction due to compact blocks or other improvements since safe limits were tested ~2 years ago?).
Or it can be so glaringly painful to use on a daily basis that these types of alternate proposals get wide-spread support even with the issues highlighted in this summary.  Only argue about your opponents' faults if you can come up with something better.

Isn't it true that if everyone used P2Pool, we'd essentially have a 30 second block reward system running along side the 10 minute bitcoin block reward?  Why wouldn't we just implement the P2Pool protocol directly into bitcoin?  The technicalities of the different mining protocols are a little more than I'm familiar with - other than timing, how does P2Pool's protocol differ from native Bitcoin or from Ghost?
@_date: 2016-06-01 17:23:22
Progress-freeness being a new term to me, I could stand some help understanding it.
If the size of the blocks (and thus transmission and validation time) is kept constant, reduced interblock intervals would reduce progress-freeness.  If the size of the blocks (and T&amp;V time) scales linearly with interblock interval, then progress-freeness wouldn't be impacted at all, would it?  If the T&amp;V time scales more than linearly (higher power) (and then assuming that block size still scales linearly with block interval), then reducing the interblock interval would INCREASE progress-freeness, yes?
And to address the general pros vs cons to isn't mining centralization mostly impacted by variability in finding a block over time?  With only ~4000 blocks per month, reward distribution among miners is fairly discrete - the tail of the distribution curve (small miners) are particularly affected.  For example, if my hash rate is such that I might get only 0.2 blocks per month, I'd likely make the decision not to mine on my own.  Chances are that my equipment won't find a block in month 1 or 2, yet hash rate will increase such that my expected reward is only 0.1 blocks per month in the third month.  So an increase in the number of blocks is effectively a more even distribution and a potential reduction in mining centralization.
Thanks for any reply.

At best, this could be a poll.  Don't take any of the responses as a blanket for the rest of the users in this sub.
Reading this again, it seems a little rambling...sorry.
That said, my own opinion is that bitcoin's use as a worldwide P2P cash system is currently limited by technical capabilities.  If bitcoin goes through another bubble, use (running a full node) could quickly outpace home computer capabilities...but it seems to be a near thing.  Faster block communication techniques may alleviate the biggest concern today - network speed.  From my own perspective, disk storage isn't an issue even for 10x increase.  CPU use also doesn't seem to be a problem.  So, if a bubble in transactions came a year from now (after some form of communication improvement and some form of block increase - SegWit and/or hardfork), I'd expect 10x to still be reasonable for maintaining a node on your home PC.
At the same time, I'm not even sure if we need to have EVERY person be a full node.  Supposedly, there's 178,000 people here that could be running a full node.  But we've got &lt;5000 people doing that.  It probably costs me &lt;$10/yr in electricity to use my home computer as a full node today.  It took me 5 minutes to download software and let it run overnight to give myself the power to be PART of bitcoin...but most people can't be bothered to do that.  BUT, I think that 5000 nodes is really quite decentralized compared to the fiat system that most people would be coming from.  Rather than 10 guys in a room deciding currency policy, we have a couple thousand people spread across the globe doing that.  Maybe that's good enough.
If that is good enough...maybe 1000 people is good enough.  And maybe I'd expect them (not require them, just believe they'd be self-directed to) to pay a couple thousand dollars a year to run a full node.   And maybe they could then support 1000x capacity beyond today.  That's like home-banking level for most of the world, but not quite credit card level.  Give it another decade past that, technology increase, it gets down to credit card (each person a couple transactions per day) level transactions.  And another decade after that, and credit card level transactions can be supported on a home PC.
So maybe summary:
Today - settlement layer for the world.
2-5 years - reasonably decentralized home-banking
15 years - reasonably decentralized credit card transactions
25 years - totally decentralized credit card transactions

It's not "blind" trust.  It's more like hybrid SPV / full node.  25,000 partially full nodes can very well be more decentralized beyond the 5,000 Bitcoin nodes.  Does anyone have any measures of "full" nodes that can more directly compare the two networks?  And if we start talking about the amount of those nodes that are doing mining vs. asic hardware being controlled by very few individuals....bitcoin maximalists start crying.


Transaction count isn't a direct measure of decentralization, but it's the freaking point of this post...that increased transaction count will inhibit decentralization.  Completely relevant to the discussion if another coin is pushing more transactions through a higher nodecount.

How is this true?  In the case of bitcoin with a market cap of ~$70B, the PoS attack would cost ~51% of the stake value or ~$35B, yes? (maybe make some estimate for %overall coins that are staked at some % of that?)  And the cost to attack Bitcoin is roughly equal to the annual mining reward of ~$3B.
And maybe somewhat pedantically, assuming the attacker destroys the system, the PoS attacks leave the attacker with absolutely no value.  PoW attackers have hardware that can mine other SHA256 coins or at least expensive space heaters.  Maybe NOT pedantically, having a second valuable SHA256 coin makes this type of attack much less costly.

@_date: 2017-08-23 01:32:44
If you don't mind, see my edit to my earlier post.
As for LN, there's tons of possibly legitimate problems that have been identified with LN (much in the same way there were "problems" with bitcoin 7 years ago).  That's not to say that someone won't figure them out and make the system work, but it is clearly not a silver bullet or even yet very trustworthy.
If you're suggesting I'm trying to "kick off" people, you're trying to "exclude" people that could otherwise use bitcoin today or in the last- and next- 6 months.  I'm still of the opinion that we can somewhat take the discussion to extremes to illustrate the two apparent sides to the debate.    If we had 10GB blocks that ran in only a handful of datacenters worldwide, we'd have millions of low-value transactions that *may* be centrally controlled (that hardware would be less specialized than asic hardware is today).  However, if we had 1KB blocks that could run on anyone's flip phone, I don't think anyone would care about the words "Bitcoin" or "cryptocurrency".
In truth, I'm happy to see separate forks that allow multiple implementations to be tested.  Also as I'm truly happy to see altcoins test and validate other useful technologies.  I'm not restricted from participating in any of them, so I'm happy to see very many suggestions on possible solutions.  
@_date: 2017-08-25 20:39:36
So many questions for you..
* Why did we have less than 1MB blocks for 6 years if what you say is true?
* I really don't know what you mean by "artificially" cheap - what's artificial about block space?
* Why would these people running 1T data centers provide file backup services for free?  Would they have any incentive to keep the actual blocks less than 1T?
From your lower comment, "most" nodes -last analysis I saw was old and said 2MB was the "safe" limit.  
Is blocksize (or rather block Weight in SegWit terms) the most important factor for the quantity of people running full nodes?  How about the quantity of miners?
Do you personally run a full node or have any input on what size blocks you could handle?
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:55:07

That doesn't make it "unfair".  Whether it's an exploit of the mining algo or not, it's a weakness of that algo that IS present.  It is the job of any miner to publish more successful solutions to the network and asicboost is doing that.  Are they making some nodes believe that the solution isn't valid?  Is some entity coercively forcing you to stay with the weak PoW algo through physical threat?  Are they forcing double-spends through the network?  Robbing people of money in some way?
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:50:13
Sure, but any comment to the first part?
@_date: 2017-08-23 02:55:41
Not the right way to look at it.  It's doing the same amount of work with less effort... That's rewarded in any other situation.  We didn't call asic developers unfairly compensated compared to gpu miners when that came about.
Would you prefer that a nefarious government developed the technology, didn't disclose it even through patent publication, and used it to attack the system at a significant advantage over current miners?  Should we ask miners to stop doing their job to the best of their ability on other accounts as well?

Modifying properties of the blockchain isn't really part of the promised immutability - only sequencing of transactions.  There really isn't "promised immutability" even, only that the network has incentives for the miners to uphold the integrity of the blockchain because they are personally vested in the blockchain.
On top of that, what your describing is using a soft-fork to modify properties of the blockchain...  How is that better than a hard fork?
BTW, the analogy for the cell phone (like all analogies of course) could be considered quite incorrect.  We could just as easily say failure to increase the blocksize limit is like:
- "If batteries get bigger, nobody will work on making more efficient electronics"
- "We can't make more efficient batteries at the same time we're working on more efficient circuits"
- "We've had these triple A batteries forever, and we know new lipo batteries can be built without too much difficulty, but then there's been a fire with lipo batteries and that risk is unacceptable"
- "Cell phones inherently cost more than $20 and not everyone in the world can afford that.  Until everyone can, we should stick with $20 wall phones."

Just reading through these project descriptions, I see that most (all?) of them claim to be in concept mode or "This is software in alpha status, don't even think about using it in production with real bitcoin."
Not to be argumentative, but including those projects in your support against a vaporware claim isn't all that supportive.
Perhaps even more to the point, just having a project listed on Git isn't much proof that a protocol has been implemented. Does anyone use this "in production with real bitcoin"?
I'd be happy to see such a working implementation, I'm just not aware of one yet.

VISA is a payment system built upon FIAT.  Altcoin 2x can be a fast and still decentralized payment system built on Bitcoin.  It's not a binary scale: 1MB = decentralized and &gt;1MB = completely centralized.

Interesting thought.  I would also propose that it's not a one-way street.  I could easily see how war / strife allows political powers to turn monetary systems toward their own will.  Perhaps as time goes, structure on both sides of the equation reinforces a faster return to the asymptotic ideal.
More thinking out-loud here:  perhaps that is the story of humanity.  We reach a near-steady state ideal for some population size.  When that population is subjected to a significant external signal (another group of people, new land discovered), war is either the mechanism for or a result of the movement toward the next steady state.  Is there any history to show length of wars or % population reduction due to war over extensive periods of time?  Is inter-planetary travel is the next signal?

That (somewhat out of context) quote is about merged mining and is his example of reasons why to avoid putting all possible blockchain uses into a single blockchain.  That discussion and blocksize limit aren't necessarily linked topics - at least in terms of orders of magnitude.  It is to contrast other possible uses (maybe BitDNS could have been used to serve up other web content including streaming media).  On top of that, it is his own conjecture of what *might* happen - not a prediction or an expectation.
Also, it's and example of how to control the entire chain, which can be done through other means.  Pruning, sharding, true / better SPV, a SegWit style dataset...any of those could impact storage of a chain on a small device.

Who knows actual reasons why - perhaps it was some accident.  Maybe he was in a car wreck and that's why he's no longer involved in the project.  Maybe he had knowledge that this particular use / attack vector was planned by a third party in the near future and was forced to have a knee-jerk implementation on the block size to start with.  Maybe it was just on his priority list and he didn't get to it.
I'd suggest that the wording he used [in his last post on the subject]( indicates he was leaning towards the side that an increased blocksize limit was *probable*.
It can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.
Not words like "It *could*" or "I *can*".  And block 115000 was ~6 months after that post - which would have been several minor releases from Satoshi at the rate he was releasing at that time.

But that original argument **is** plausible.  You then tried to refute that - by implying it's not plausible because it wasn't implemented.
What I'm saying is - it is quite possible / plausible that he *wanted to* but was not *able to* implement an increased blocksize by the end of 2012.  In fact, the rest of humanity hasn't been able to increase the blocksize limit as of this date due to several technical difficulties, perceived risks, and political viewpoints.

How crappy do we have to talk about here?

Who gets to decide this stuff and who is running any comparison of time to sync?  Why is two weeks too long?  If you want to setup PCs leaching off of McDonald's wifi running on your car battery in the parking lot, does the IBD have to be less than an hour?  Who are you to state that the network should be limited to the 200,000 richest people in the world if we limit the capacity to that many transactions a day?  Where's the belief that the system has to grow in userbase to be resistant to suppression?  
edit: Can't we rather prepare emergency contingencies as I mentioned elsewhere.  Fork the coin (with any changes to POW, hiding network connections, re-limiting footprint, etc) and preserve the UTXO.  Basically, snapshot the network and recreate it with any features we want in such an extreme case?  That feature could be built-in to core code to snapshot / checkpoint at releases or at at regular intervals.

Trying to understand here - Is it correct to assume that the idea is 100x transactions occur on LN layer as is done on BTC layer?  (or some large factor anyway).  I'm not sure if I'm right in looking at these three possible scenarios:
1 - LN is supposed to be cheaper than BTC.  In this case, there is a smaller number of fees given to the system (perhaps distributed across LN and BTC layer).  In that case, security for the network is lower than BTC alone.
2 - LN is equally as costly as BTC.  What drives any individual person to gravitate towards LN as opposed to BTC?  Wouldn't LN (from a users perspective) be seen as an unnecessary middleman?  So, even though I understand the technical need for reduced transactions on the BTC layer, why does the user care about that?
3 - LN is more costly than BTC.  Unreasonable case to get LN adoption.
Is there another solution to keeping miners interested in mining?

There are even people in the US that don't accept the government of the land as their own.  In fact, this Bitcoin community is a very good example of those tendencies.  Perhaps someone should have reached global consensus before they suggested an open-source distributed ledger system before they published such heresy against the pre-ordained currency of the land?

-What "Consensus" means.
-Whether it's Reddit's purpose to let the community talk or that the community owner gets to decide the purpose of the subreddit.

@_date: 2015-08-20 04:14:24
If you don't mind, can I provide an example and compare to my earlier scenario


Example:  [bitcoin alone]    100 transactions @ 10 btc with 0.01 btc fee each.  Overall 1 btc fee / 1000 bitcoins transacted by user.  0.01 BTC per btc transacted by miner.
[Lightning]    100 transactions @ 10 btc with no fee (perhaps generous?).  Final settlement on Bitcoin network for 0.1 BTC.  Overall 0.1 btc fee / 1000 bitcoins transacted by user.  0.1 BTC per btc transacted by miner.
So this example comparison, user fees went down by 90%, miner fees went up by 1000% per transaction.  Those both sound great!  The only downside is that fees representing network security also went down by 90%.  Perhaps this is not an issue if the bitcoin network already has an excess amount of hashpower dedicated to it?  Or perhaps we can also explain that network security requirements are reduced because many user transactions are not publicly available and we have security through obscurity (target visibility is reduced if attackers don't know about payment channels being created)?

XT can be hierarchical without causing Bitcoin to become hierarchical.
For a quick comparison - I don't ask or expect people to judge what I do in my own house (and for the most part, that's true).  When I go out in public, I'm pretty aware of social norms and agreed upon behavior.
@_date: 2015-08-23 01:47:25
I can't say that I'm directly familiar with `libconsensus`.  If I had to guess, it's the set of rules within any particular bitcoin implementation to check and validate an incoming block.  In general, the majority of the bitcoin network runs that same set of rules within whichever particular version they have.  Correct?
If I ran a `libconsensus` that had a 0.5MB block limit today, the first block I saw over that limit would be rejected by my software and I would be looking for updates from a different blockchain.  In effect, I'd be rejecting pretty much everyone in the world today.  If instead I had a 2MB limit, I'd pretty much never see a block that size (until next year at least) and still accept every block coming in to me (because they passed my, looser, rule).  No problem there.  Now, assuming I was mining and produced a block over 1MB, it would go out to the network and be rejected.  No one else loses, except for me in that case, simply because I felt like going against the grain.
Am I good so far?

I think you're carrying other discussions into this...  I'll try to separate that out (nothing against that here, just hard to discuss through type without getting over-lengthy).
The part that's in the article:  I don't think we need to fear anyone being a dictator for the larger Bitcoin network - anyone can propose and potentially make changes to the open-source software.  If Mike "turns crazy", it doesn't necessarily mean another fork; actually, the future-tense implication in your type assumes that to happen at a later date.  That means XT is reasonable now (or perhaps proven reasonable at a time when there is a fork).  If Mike was to later turn crazy, the Bitcoin Ecosystem can just stop running XT (and hopefully there are even MORE versions of software available at that time) and AVOID another fork.
Separate to the article:  Can you explain why you call this a preemptive fork to another hard fork?  Preemptive to what other proposed fork?  At the time of BIP101's inclusion into XT, I don't think there were any other BIPs that had a defined timeline.  There have been many other ideas for scalability, several related to blocksize, and a couple other BIPs.  Until XT, I don't remember any actually having a proposed implementation date.
@_date: 2016-02-12 00:05:58


Yes, the discussion about blocksize limit has been around for a while.  However, we've not actually been near the limit.  That is happening or will happen in the next few months.   **We have never before been at the limit.**  Although it may be easy to understand the technical impact of that new condition, the economic and social impact is surely not so easy to predict.


So fees/transaction is different than fees/block in a case where blocks aren't limited...  Fees per block WON"T always increase if user adoption stops happening.




It's not just casuals, it's devs arguing with devs too.  And it's people that have been in Bitcoin business for years.  And it's Devs saying that the userbase isn't smart enough to upgrade with hardforks.  And it's just the opportunity seekers limiting discussion about options...


I'm sure you meant "then"...  And it's the general Reddit philosophy that we're all arm-chair politicians and we don't need to be mindful of the fact that there are other **people** reading what we write.

Distinguishing from coercion and the change being in-fact coercion are different things.
If you agree that a change to the system should be possible, and you agree that 100% isn't reasonable, then we're only settling on a reasonably balanced number.  I was only pointing out that historical groups of people, that have put incredible amounts of effort into establishing balanced decision making systems (many of them being created and then refined based on the experience of previously failed decision making systems), have recently tended towards 2/3 as that reasonable number.
I would think this was done with a view that facilitates change without disenfranchising the group members.  For that to work, the minority group will usually join the larger group after the decision has been made - believing that cooperation as a whole is more valuable than being independent.
Unanimous systems do exist.  These seem to be for small member-groups or for life-determining decisions.

I'll take a little bit of an exception to this -
Scaling could definitely mean changing a constant for allowed size.  McDonald's doesn't have a limit that says they can only have one location per state (or county, or city, or even airport).  We could say they need to server move customers per location, or more per register, or tell customers they can wait until 3 pm to have lunch...
But realistically, they build more locations.
Or server management.  15 years ago, I was allowed 150MB server space at work.  They could have told me that limit will never change.  I need to stop creating extra information, or prune the old information I'm no longer using, or use external storage solutions like CDs / DVDs / USB sticks, or use data compression techniques....
Again realistically, my allotment has grown such that I'm now allowed 8GB of personal space on the network server.
Sorry for being a bit pedantic.  I realize that a one-time change to the block-size limit will not provide much of a scaling solution.  But, it does provide some short-term scalability relief (about as much as Seg-Wit will).  That seems to be on the order of a little less than a year.  So either of those solutions could take us to the end of this year, and both could get us as far as the end of 2017.  That's another two years to continue working on even more solutions.
-LN or other side-chain implementation.
-IBLT or other communication techniques.
-A longer-term modification of the blocksize limit (something that increases over time).
@_date: 2016-02-24 02:00:13
Making a guess here, but I'd expect is aware of LN including its benefits, shortcomings, and unknowns (he does call it a "settlement system").  In fact, it's often cited as a conflict of interest that we have a group of people directly acting to develop "layer-2 protocols" (and businesses surrounding these) while being the currently most-followed Bitcoin implementation.  It's not quite as big of a deal because Bitcoin is open-source and the developers are frequently vocal about their opinions - it's not really being hidden.
re: your Cool Fact - one of my biggest concerns here is that these "layer-2" protocols might disrupt the economics or social contract of the Bitcoin system.  Other than that, they don't yet exist...

@_date: 2016-02-01 19:13:12
I don't understand why you continue to be so rude to people.  You needn't say "Were it a novel, you wouldn't have read it".
And again, correlating user increase with a decrease in node count is ignoring the prevalence of SPV wallets as well as the increase in high quality web-wallets (as opposed to Mt. Gox).  While these uses may not be strictly increasing the decentralization of the bitcoin network, it does give reason to believe Hermel's postulation on ratio between node count and usercount is still valid.
@_date: 2016-02-10 04:49:20
So why wouldn't you write something more like:
Classic doesn't go through a period of exponentially increasing fees and disenfranchising users..
Both Core and Classic are outpaced by another Crypto that integrates ALL of these proposals..
Bitcoin loses VC funding as the network is proven to be capacity limited at some point in 2016..
Dunno, for my point I'm happy to see alternate proposals in the off case core fails.  
@_date: 2016-02-01 23:42:49
Transactions since late 2012 have gone up from ~20,000/day to ~200,000/day today.  Either SPV and webwallet usage has gone up (significantly), or the roughly 5,000 node operators are making 40 transactions per day each.
That last scenario paints a really bleak picture for Bitcoin if only 5000 node operators are both maintaining and using the network.

RBF as a concept isn't all that great, no matter what form it takes.  If only two transactions can fit in a block, RBF just lets the "rich" guy push out the "poor" guy.
Of course, the "poor" guy can increase his fees and become the "rich" guy as well...perhaps in an escalating fashion.
And then in a non-full block scenario, is RBF even required?  Perhaps it would be, if miners started advertising required fees and excluding below a fee threshold.
@_date: 2016-02-24 15:18:44
Pretty much this one.  It sets up an auction system for transactions that doesn't really stabilize the current time for transactions to be included in a block.  As I increase my fee and certainty that I will soon be included in a block, I inherently decrease someone else's certainty.  This happens within ~10 minute intervals, but may setup a traffic jam for extended hours at a time.
There's no fixed price, no forecasting, and no flexibility in the system to prevent the traffic jam.  Overall, this sets up a poor user experience and decreases the attractiveness of bitcoin.
And what problem is it trying to solve?  It is trying to allow users to fix transactions that didn't have enough of a fee to be included in a near-term block!!  It only does that by transferring the problem to another user.  Truly not a good solution to the problem it's trying to solve. 
And on top of that, this is in a system that is already supported with a roughly 1% subsidy to miners anyway.
Can you explain to me how RBF increases the OVERALL utility of the bitcoin network?

I feel horrible that I have to qualify my posts, but I've been around BTC since 2012 and daily keep up with topics and tech.  I'm a computer hobbyist that has run a full node at differing times over the years (not today admittedly) but not a technical crypto expert.
I do have a differing opinion on priorities of Bitcoin and the best path forward.  I'm reasonably confident that any path will eventually lead to success.
I do get frustrated, as many others do, at this type of conversation here.  If you or Adam don't want to "put up with that", I'm not sure how to help you.  I wouldn't ask you to leave, but I would also ask that you respectfully listen to my voice too.
Most simply, I see many people continually fighting against "contentious hard forks" yet seemingly continuing to stall efforts to make them non-contentious.

That kind of summarizes your attitude doesn't it?


How much consideration do you expect?  Word for word?  Adam seems to mischaracterize the NYA as an ultimatum and then says "those present could only design/code/propose".  Miners can clearly run / implement the code in production as well - as was clearly outlined in the HKA.  


No, that's clear.  That it is at this point - not that it MUST have been, but it is for some group of people.  I'm OK with contentious forks.  I think it's silly that other people claim to be afraid of contentious forks, make their own deals which proposes to safely implement a fork, then complain when others actually do implement that fork.


Whether or not that is true, most light wallets would have the functionality to support 2X as many do not validate blocksize anyway.
And speaking of not being a "good faith actor":

If you're getting to the point where you call the concept of "taxation" as theft then you should be considering the consequences of that thought process.  Moving to a location where you will not have to use resources that other people have created (which would be your personal theft from everyone who has submitted to taxation) is the only way for you to still uphold your reasoning.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:28:33
No, not very much.  I read the [HKA]( and the [NYA]( to be very similar.  In fact, [others have made the same observation.](
From my point of view, the most noticeable difference is the participation in each agreement.  HKA had 38 members from 25 organizations that represented mostly core / miners.  NYA includes ~58 organizations representing some miners and some of the largest economic players.  From the point of view of this thread, I would guess your viewpoints stem from lack of participation in the NYA.
My opinion is that two years ago, you participated in an agreement.  The other participants in the agreement have continued that agreement despite your own withdrawal.  While you could also work with them on the agreement you helped originate, you are asking them to stop their work because we should all "work together" ... even though your participation in their work would **BE** the "work together" you are asking for.
And your other reason for lack of participation - contentious hard forks that aren't big enough to be meaningful.  Contentious because of your lack of participation (see last paragraph).  Also, perhaps 2X is just right to prove hard forking mechanisms safe.  Baby steps.
@_date: 2017-10-23 20:24:54
That's actually a fairly good question.  I expect most users are using lite wallets - most of which doesn't validate block size.  Many would transition to the chain with highest hashrate.
However, I could be wrong.  Several wallets use validated servers and would trust whichever data this server uses.  As those servers are full nodes, it would be up to the operator of that server to make the decision of which chain to follow.  One person could potentially impact quite a few other people.
In any case, interesting times.

Left to work as implemented, it would also have potentially caused BTC to experience complete outages as there would be no miners left on that chain.  Perhaps the miners not switching to BCH when it is more profitable should be considered "gaming" the system.
To me, "gaming" EDA would be allowing it to decrease difficulty for an excessive drop instead of switching to BCH as soon as it is profitable.

I think the relevant section is:


I think this could be read from anywhere between "We're trying to reach as many people as possible while still keeping decentralization, security, and permissionless innovation" to "Any erosion of these values isn't permitted to expand the number of users".  Perhaps it's even meant to varying degrees by each person signing.
Perhaps the most relevant thing this document 'says' is, we are working on it together and in a timely fashion.  I'd hope Mike or Gavin attend as much to signify cooperation as to actually try and convince anyone to their opinion.  I can't help but think that anyone NOT attending will be relegated to "You had your chance to play nice and you didn't even want to come to the party".  In other words, nothing positive could come from them staying home.
@_date: 2015-09-09 23:32:25
Thanks for the reply.  I'd offer some counterpoints for consideration.
1 - Increased value of the bitcoin network, and thus increased price of bitcoin, will increase the value of the block reward.  This could\would impact miners revenue and increase the number of miners more than increasing fees (assuming btc value stays the same).  While it seems reasonable to establish a "fee market" at some point, is that now when presumably less than 0,1% of the population uses bitcoin?
2 - What level of mining is sufficient?  Is that measured by number of miners, total hash power, or some combination?  If we have  3600btc reward /day and ~250,000btc transacted / day, that's 1.4% security...not too bad, probably even much.    Is it Ok to have only ~10 major mining pools?
As for forks, who can say.  I expect the system to be adaptable to some extent - else it will be replaced by something else that doesn't have it's defects.  Perhaps we're already reaching that point.
@_date: 2015-09-02 23:49:37

Can anyone give support in relative numbers as to what degree we'll see a change in centralization?  Something like 2mb blocks increases miners or node fees by 2% or 20% and we could expect to see a similar drop in miners / nodes?  I see the point made that obviously higher costs will exclude some nodes / miners - that doesn't seem like much of a logical leap, but also doesn't give all that much strength to the argument.
Over 5 months (miner service life):
Something like 1TH/s miner @ $1000 ($200/mo) +
Hard drive and raspberry pi @ $200 ($40/mo) +
standard internet @ $50/mo +
electricity @ $200/mo =
And then show something about what a change in blocksize does to that cost.

My parents are involved in a trade association that participates in its own currency that hasn't been attacked by the government.  Amazon has its own currency.  The US Fed is an institution that regulates / participates in monetary supply that is not a direct governmental agency.  I don't think you can consider this correct.
"onerous" regulations about money laundering or other similar activities are part of what makes opinion about US activities positive as compared to other areas that are considered corrupt.  I have yet to see regulations that are unfairly balanced against bitcoin as opposed to fiat or other commodities / stores of value.  To some level, I see current regulations having difficulty understanding / defining what bitcoin "IS" - it's a new thing that has little frame of reference for many people.  It requires an unusual understanding of technology and economics.

The point of my examples was to show decreasing degrees of risk.  For a car, you assume you will extract value from the car by driving it over some time period - it won't break down (more than expected), it won't be involved in an accident, you will survive long enough to make it worthwhile.
As it relates to OP, many of rBitcoiners have made the same assessment as OP.  Risk vs. reward potential seemed / seems favorable for bitcoin due to continued increasing price and limited appearance of new factors against bitcoin.
The thread has been talking about gamble vs. investment as if there's some well defined criteria where one becomes the other.  This doesn't exist*, and thus every person is arguing over personal opinions as if they were fact.
That's the internet for ya!
*Perhaps "investment" is ownership of an object that can increase or decrease in value.  Or perhaps "gambling" is taking a stake in an outcome where the odds are known to be against you.  In either case, it's just degrees of risk vs. reward assessment and should be described as such.

This argument seems so tenuous I have a hard time understanding what you're getting at.  Blocksize / market cap continued and continues to grow up until this point - should we have been halting increase at any point up until now?  And why would not be the good time?
What proof have we that the "state" will attack bitcoin.  Wouldn't it have been easiest to attack it now while it has been publicly unknown and unused?  Surely the government has known about it for years as the CIA and FinCEN investigate and release notifications about it.  Even two years ago, there were weekly outcries of "China bans bitcoin" - why ban it when you can just destroy it (especially considering the location of majority mining equipment).
And to propose that today's blocksize is a good defense against outside attack?  What about increased utility so that there is more user support?  What about incentives to run full nodes as opposed to SPV / webwallets?
How would we recognize a social battle against bitcoin if the members of the state started cloaking attacks against bitcoin under the guise of support in Reddit forums.  "Protect yourselves from the state by minimizing you're overall impact"
And why fear this adversity as opposed to other possible opposition - other crypto, other payment networks or other stores of value, internal strife and lack of direction?
I mean I would consider this kind of argument as approaching a phobia.

The analogy is actually quite appropriate even if the conclusion is a bit overstated.
I think "actual" time changes if a sufficient number of people change.  If laws come out telling everyone to change and then YOU don't change, I think you'll be the one having problems and not everyone else.  That's probably the centralized coordination...  The decentralized version is the same except for the "laws telling everyone" becomes more "everyone communicates and agrees".  In either case, if you're the exception you're going to have a bad time.

I have to say, I somewhat look at this as market investigation.  You have ~172,000 people on here that have some interest in bitcoin.  How many of them have wanted to buy a mining rig, only to find out they either cost a bunch of money or are too old to do squat (electricity vs. hashrate wise).  Now tell them they can get something with competitive efficiency and spend a reasonable amount to get it - perhaps sold.
Now tell me the chip comes in a form factor like a graphics card, I can buy another one next year at better efficiency and just plug it in (I don't worry about power supply, bootstrapping the blockchain again, doing any different config) - even better.
It doesn't have to be THE best design, or offer the most options...just make it accessible to the technically illiterate masses (ala iPhone) .

A hard-fork version of Segwit can remove the 1mb limit, but a softfork version cannot, correct?  I mean that's the definition of a hardfork - "removal of a consensus rule".
My understanding is that a softfork version will apply two rules 1) transaction data in a "normal" block that is still limited to 1mb.  This allows non-segwit nodes to accept these blocks.  2) Witness data in a separate "block" (or other data structure) that applies a second rule of total size limited to 4mb.

Ignoring blocksize whatsoever, can we make sufficient argument that bitcoin isn't currently PayPal 2.0?  What defines "not PayPal" to you?  Would you strive that the majority of the Bitcoin userbase is validating their own transactions?  That it's a sizable portion at 25% or 10%?  Should we strive for a fixed quantity of full nodes rather than a percentage?
With ~5000 nodes, that's ~3% of the subscribers here.  At 6MM transactions per month, is that ~0.1%?  Is 5000 spread worldwide enough because it's sufficient to avoid collusion or attack?  That's ignoring the constant discussions about pools and the lack of diversity there.
We've spent so much time talking about ensuring the decentralization of bitcoin, but it hasn't been working - transaction count has increased by ~60% while node count has decreased by ~25%.  And this is at a time when I'd have to say bitcoin will have its highest ratio of tech geeks and libertarians who are personally interested in running their own node.  SPV and webwallets are just too easy to use.  10 minute blocks are too discrete and hashrate moves too fast to support a significantly large number of independent mining organizations.

Likewise, the phrasing here implies that "core" is adopting the fork - whereas it is every user in the bitcoin network that is adopting the fork.  "core" is free to make code available, but the network must decide if it's beneficial to run such code.

Well, you linked a list with 25 people and then only counted the top 20.  And then said only 4...when there was 5 (or 6 if you used the entire list of 25).
[Luke talks about employment here]( and also doesn't refute being a co-founder.  At the very least, he has been paid by blockstream - which is what claimed.
So by the first measure you list to discredit the original information, it IS quite true - thanks for giving the sources and making it easy to see.  And by that same LoC estimate, Pieter and Gregory alone have ~21,000 of the ~50,000 lines commited...
So, a good summary would be that Blockstream has a very significant involvement in the direct coding of the bitcoin core repository.  And calling the original statement "simply not true" or "disinformation" is out of place.  If I were I'd feel quite comfortable standing by my original statement.

Visa is centralized - of course you can take it down with a button.  Government isn't flawless or rational, but it is ruthless and certain areas can certainly be more effective than anyone involved in bitcoin (given the extensive resources).  Surely they could DDOS the entire group of 5000 full nodes, or tell ISPs to prevent routing traffic, or capture and get rid of key public figures, or pay some interns to make randomized reddit accounts "slfsdqmjfeopa" and disrupt rational conversation.
Low requirements for nodes are never going to compete with SPV / webwallets.  You don't make people DO something just by making it easy to do that thing, they actually have to WANT to do that thing.  Right now, why does someone want to run a full node when they can download an app to their phone and use bitcoin, which they own private keys to, when the bitcoin network is seemingly proving its capability to be useful in its current state?  As much as current evidence proves that 1MB is acceptable to the bitcoin ecosystem, it's also proving that ~5000 nodes is an acceptable amount of decentralization.  Why support more nodes at this point?

The fact that Luke is or is not a co-founder, is really a distraction from the argument - he HAS BEEN PAID by Blockstream.  That's then 6 or 7.  And as I mentioned the list is really more like 22 if you count people removed from the list.
That's one company, that has publicized direct involvement with 32% of the current bitcoin developers and &gt;40% of the current Lines of Code.  You can move the posts and start counting every other developer that may have had some involvement, but that involvement is fairly insignificant.

As part of replacing, it would likely replicate most current functions - including banks, online payment systems, remittance, money stores...  Coinbase (or someone else) acting similar to Paypal seems inevitable.  Actually, it seems almost obvious that early and easy success in the bitcoin arena comes from copying existing businesses and also including bitcoin.

As much as paper markers that used to represent fixed amounts of gold can be stored in a mattress, wallets that represent a known amount of controllable bitcoin can be stored in many forms - including paper under your mattress.
@_date: 2016-07-27 22:21:59
While that can be true, your concern is rather a question of security (for the cryptography, for the house, for the mattress) - which is a side topic to the discussion of the nature of bitcoin or other currencies.
As much as digital security can pose a risk to bitcoin holders, house fires can pose a risk to people storing cash under their mattress.  Cryptography allows a person to protect against a single point of fire (house burning) by making multiple copies of keys.
And then, as much as that may increase risk for multiple sites getting robbed, also allows for multiple keys (multi-sig) to also protect against any single point of failure.

Do you mean to say Electrum is both SPV and Centralized?  or - It's using SPV while connecting to a centralized server?
I think BitcoinWallet's intent was to say that SPV is meant to be a shortcut version of Bitcoin's trustless system.  Because Electrum uses centralized servers, it's really not fulfilling the intent of Bitcoin.  I believe it's closer than a web wallet which acts as a two-way door between the user and the blockchain - Electrum can post data to the bitcoin network directly, but initially trusts data from Electrum servers.
This is from memory on how Electrum works, so feel free to correct me.

@_date: 2016-07-21 23:54:32
There are so many things wrong with this post, I have a hard time cutting to the point.  Fortunately, I agree with your last statement - "For Bitcoin to be undefeatable, we should strive to make running a full node easier than any centralized API so that each merchant enforces the rules of Bitcoin independently, securing both themselves and Bitcoin as a whole."
For the rest of the post:


Wait, what?  A successful (even in quotes) hardfork demonstrates danger?




As others have said, backup?  Bitcoin has ~200,000 transactions per day backed by ~20 miners and ~5500 nodes.  How is that even close to decentralized?  Perhaps we only have 5500 users making 40 transactions each day?  On top of that, I would expect miners, exchanges, and other large businesses are running multiple full nodes apiece.
On top of that, your line implies that reversal of the DAO "theft" is "bad".  Returning stolen funds is commonly considered good.  Most governments or other social systems allow for rule changes to provide needed clarity after such unforeseen incidents.


It's a system that allows for hard forks.  Hard forks ARE the nature of bitcoin.  They don't subvert that nature - you are falsely attributing a nature to Bitcoin that it does not posses.  It is software that helps enforce a social contract between many humans.  It's basis is that most humans will value the success of the system to the point where individuals cannot subvert the majority.  It stems from a desire to break away from a system where a minority of people in banks / government could subvert the will of the majority.  There are several points of the white paper describing "majority" and "honest nodes" but nowhere that says "absolutely" or "incorruptible".


Clear communication and enforcement of a social contract backed by some of the most significant computing power in the world.  It has better [properties of money]( than most other systems existing.


I can't decipher what you mean here.  Is it that case that "Bitcoin must very rarely undergo hardforks" or not?  Do you just mean that full nodes will never allow for a hardfork that they don't agree on?  (your past posts make me believe you would use the word "contentious" here, but I'm not sure how that word applies)


While that may be true, what is "significant"?  What is a good amount of decentralization?  Should we have 20% of BTC users running nodes and should that number be closer to 100,000 nodes?  Does that mean we should decrease max block size?  Or are there other, greatly more significant, contributors to full node count?  The general existence of SPV nodes that have ~0 cost to run (which makes almost any costs of running a full node unbearable), pools that exist because of the limited and discrete nature of 10 minute block intervals, PoW's inherent drive towards mining centers and hardware centralization, lack of a bitcoin-core or other phone wallet that integrates easy connection to a personal and trusted full node.  I'm repeatedly baffled by the very ARGUMENT of blocksize limit when there are so many other concerning factors to discuss.


I don't think Bitcoin (or certainly not is the only "righteous and just" champion of the people.  Cryptocurrency in general is a great solution.  Your actions in limiting conversation around some of Bitcoin's shortcomings does not help bitcoin overall, but rather fragments the community and hinders the "we should strive" effort.  While I can understand the difficulty of having clear rules to weed out continually toxic and harmful discussion, the spirit of the moderation community has taken on it's own nature of oppression with a side-tone of mocking for altcoins.

Under the Classic activation method you described, where one mining pool is at 30% and is the last to switch to 2MB support, there would be 100% support for Classic at the time of 75% rolling voting is triggered.  So, it is technically "allowed".
I think what you and are arguing over isn't described by the words you are both using.  I think you (jonny) are asking for a window of time around the activation point to show more than 75%.  Which, as points out equates to the same effect as the grace period (or perhaps it extends the grace period depending on your point of view).
@_date: 2017-06-03 00:54:07
Segwit isn't "locked in" and doesn't necessarily preclude 2MB blocks. (they can both be done, 2MB and SegWit).
Having any kind of "window" doesn't prevent declining momentum either...again, it's similar to a grace period.

But what they are trying to say is that your question does not make sense the way you have phrased it.  Just coming to the thread now, I read your writing as "With the rolling voting mechanism, why not have a range of acceptance from 75-100%".  As is pointed out, rolling voting excludes the possibility of a range - it WILL activate at the minimum of the range (making it effectively NO window).  However, the Grace Period has a similar / same effect as having a window.
To me, it reads like one person is asking for 5 +/-2 and the other person is asking for 3 +4/-0.  Specifying the same concept with different terminology.

I've never looked into mining pools, so I'm due some education here.  My question works under the understanding that most miners are rewarded for computational power added to the collective - but not for actually creating the currency.  The mining pool operator would be the actual person responsible for currency creation and subject to *money transmitter* regulations.  The miner is only compensated for his time and effort.  Does that situation seem reasonable?

Actually, no.  I'm not sure if you're trying to think of bitcoin as an investment instead of a currency.
I can't see a case where bitcoin is "saturated".  As in, so many people are using dollars, more people don't want to use dollars - that doesn't make sense.
Now, if there was only a limited number of something and you couldn't split it up, that I can see.  But bitcoin is divisible to the 0.00000001 right now even.  That puts the currently available bitcoin units at 1.2 quadrillion (Satoshis).  That's roughly the equivalent of the total world's currency expressed in cents.  I don't see that being "saturated" in even the extended future.  And even so, modify the protocol to add a couple digits and everything's good again.

With bitcoin being unregulated, I'd say speculation has pretty little chance of giving bias to the current btc/dollar price - it should be pretty much right at the point where supply meets demand.
With btc market cap at &lt;$2billion, and world currency over $20trillion, that says roughly one in 10,000 people has switched to btc over all currency alternatives.  Or maybe 1 in 1,000 has switched 10% of their currency to btc - something like that anyway.
Anyway, your question was about some day in the future when btc becomes "scarce".  A whole, single btc might be scarce - yes.  But that's the same as saying a billion dollars in one place is pretty scarce.  I'd says it's more reasonable that people will use Satoshis as a commonplace unit at that day in the future.
@_date: 2013-11-13 00:59:00
What's the purpose of this bitcoin thing at all if we have to do transactions "off the block"?  Instead, I'm relegated to trusting in a third party again?
Can't we get some sort of hybrid system where we have separate blockchains?   Separate transactions in some manner - firstbits, IP ranges, transaction value, etc. - and allow miners to distribute portions of the blockchain to each other?  There'd have to be a bit of a balance in CPU power vs. network bandwidth.  That's more of a conceptual framework than ironed out details (OBVIOUSLY), but it's an effort at least.  However, it seems to fit with the Bitcoin -&gt; bit-torrent comparisons we occasionally hear.
@_date: 2013-10-11 02:16:16
This doesn't really apply to the original question, but I'll discuss anyway.
For the btc that was mined at the start - from what I've seen of blockchain analytics, there's quite a bit of them that have been unused / untraded in quite a while.  If they were quickly used / traded, I'd naturally expect to see a change in the btc/$ prices.  However, bitcoin has a defined limit of total btc ever possible.  This makes prediction of future value quite a bit more stable than most other currencies - dollars can be printed (to what is practically unlimited supply) and gold or other natural materials could be found in large quantities in nature.  I think any other cryptocurrency would be well advised to either permanently limit overall quantity or to give it a defined growth rate ~3-4%/yr.
If SR was the biggest market, all of those btc were just taken out of the useful market by the feds.  So both demand and supply went down - probably in proportion to each other.  When the feds decide or find a way to sell them, I'd expect to see btc/$ price drop then.
As for China, I don't know why they would "speculate" in btc any more than the rest of the world.  I think they'd use / speculate them just like the rest of us.  If more people / exchanges open in China, that means a larger demand for the good and is likely a long term or permanent change in price.

I've been taking out the data around the summer of '11 for some time now - explaining it as an outlier created by GOX screwup and the bitcoin system not reaching a steady state yet.  With the resulting chart, it has an R^2 value of 0.96 - that's a really freaking good correlation for any numbers found in nature.
That said, this relationship doesn't necessarily lead to a prediction of the future - any curve is reasonably estimated by a line for a small section of the curve.  The farther you are outside your bounds, the less correlation you should get.  I say there will be an upper bound on growth determined by some form of world monetary supply.
edit:  Of course, the last qualification is only true as the current chart of BTC/USD is a measure of value.  If a majority (or all) of USD is converted to BTC, the chart would actually reach to infinity.  That's actually a case that's slightly worrisome - as older people, being less likely to adopt bitcoin, have large sums of money as USD, CNY, Euro in retirement funds.  These funds would be worthless at some point in the future.  That's actually an interesting point that could deserve its own thread.

If that's 6months - 2years, I might be with you.  If it's longer than that (or even now in some cases) just plan on USING them.  In fact, you can plan on using them now and just keep converting your current $ to BTC as you go.
This encourages you to keep familiar with the state of affairs on BTC without increasing your risk by continually increasing your investment.  As mentioned in other places (and similar to how most people manage money today), it can help to have a smaller fund available for quick spending in a convenient location (I like Coinbase myself) and a larger fund in a paper wallet / cold storage.
For the cold storage option, research a bit about securing that stash - fresh computer, bootable installation, offline creation (bitaddress), multiple copies stored in separate locations.  Alternately, use a brainwallet generated private key and don't keep any copies.  You may want to share that type information with your beneficiary.

Haven't read all of the articles in your links yet, but I believe the "value" of bitcoin is the cryptography.  Essentially, the cryptography is based on energy necessary to defeat the system.  Energy.  Hopefully people understand the value of that.

Haven't looked into ASIC energy efficiency.  As they are more "powerful" (faster computations), they will indeed only shift the wealth distribution initially.
However, the electricity requirement for mining right now is making mining only a break-even endeavour.  If mining were to become more energy efficient, I could see that getting more people into mining / bitcoins in general - thus giving the bitcoin concept more stability and even further increasing interest (and interest = demand / price of bitcoins).
Otoh, if ASICs drive a large force of GPU miners out of business, it could crash the system in the opposite direction.

There are quite a few discussions along these lines already being posted on these forums.  For an altcoin to succeed, it would need some "significant" advantage over bitcoin.  Right now, bitcoin isn't that widely used - an altcoin with all of bitcoin's properties and wider marketing or a significant adopter (a government or large worldwide corp.) could easily take over.
As bitcoin adoption continues, the need for a "significant" advantage will increase - potential areas already being discussed (not all inclusive, just ones off the top of my head)
 - Proof of work is energy consuming and provides no other value outside of the bitcoin network.
 - This leads to a potential imbalance in centralization / decentralization as mining becomes unprofitable for people unable to build highly efficient mining rigs.  I'm inclined to think this may be a property of ANY currency system - resources to sustain the currency system cannot be too burdensome on the system itself.
 - The number of transactions per time may be limited by hardware capabilities which would not satisfy worldwide need for currency.
 - The rate of finding blocks at 1 per 10 min and the need for multiple level verification is sometimes deemed as long.
 - The encryption used for the protocol could be broken.
 - Bitcoin usage is not currently "user friendly".  
As for becoming "quite scarce and sought after", that's like saying I won't use dollars because I've never seen 1000 dollar bill.  Or saying we should all trade in leaves because they are easy to come by.  Bitcoin are already quite divisible and the protocol can be easily modified to increase that flexibility - it's not a point I'm worried about at all.

There's quite a bit of difficulty getting that to work mathematically.  An attempt at a direct correlation only gives and R^2 value of 0.0004.  The price fluctuates up and down, where Reddit subscribers pretty much only goes up.  There's so much time where there's very little change in price and it's quite overshadowed by the short periods of large growth.  Then the price bounced back down without a bunch of people unsubbing at Reddit.
Overall, just much easier to get your eyes to see that Reddit spikes follow a bit behind price spikes and leave it at that.

The QT client is syncing by essentially downloading the entire history (ledger) of transactions.  This first time takes quite a while, but is relatively fast after that (took me ~15 min. after not syncing for a week).
To do transactions, the client doesn't really need to be synced.  All you need is a public address to receive coins at - see "receive coins-&gt;address" (I'm pretty sure you can have this before even the first sync).  With the QT client, be careful - even though the public address is shown, I don't believe it shows the private keys without some difficulty.  Private keys are the important part of bitcoins - with it, you could re-generate a public address if the public address was lost.  The private key is the part you want to keep duplicated, safe, and don't share it.
Storing data in an online wallet is sometimes seen as a faster method, but the website will have "ownership" of the bitcoins - if they decide to fold up shop and just take what money they hold, you may lose what you have with them.

Btc will not be even relatively deflationary for a hundred years when all coins are mined. Even then, I'd argue the supply is pretty fixed and not really decreasing (some destroyed or forever lost coins, yes). Wouldn't this fixed currency base discourage both  hoarding and deficit spending?
