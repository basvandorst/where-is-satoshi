I’m the USA and already know. My friends and family in Russia want to do it. They want to allocate a percentage of savings into it. Access to proceeds is not relevant currently. They can wait to buy and to cash out. Financial privacy is dependent on Russia. I do not know. I want to make sure they can all buy legally and play taxes properly.
