 Satoshi's vision wasn't to get early adopters enough money from new money to quit their jobs.

bitcoin will topple this inequality. us coiners will be the new 1&amp; warren buffet will ask us for handouts
@_date: 2018-05-08 19:21:28
Warren Buffet is old and dumb. Make way for new smart investors like me! Hodl to the moon baby
@_date: 2018-05-03 19:01:32
Oh I didn't know you were working in crypto. What's your new job? 
@_date: 2018-05-24 15:35:56
Oh shit look at those MASSES. To the moon bois. This is your LAST chance to buy bitcoin under 8k. Don't be left at the station when it starts MOONING. Hodl tight
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:47:22
completely premature no? You could just as make a list of hype trains that failed and add Buffet's quote considering we don't know what will happen with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:48:43
there are zero guarantees 
@_date: 2018-02-27 08:52:31
1) yes but skeptical as to the extent of how much of a thing it is. Will it have mass adoption? Will its values plummet ? Who knows
2) almost nonexistent so I don't buy.
I don't really get your questions
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:54:48
You do realize the market doesn't care how enthusiastic its fan bases are? Bitcoin didn't surge to 19k because of its great technology. If Bitcoin plummets, it's not because the technology is no longer great, it's still the same.

mrw when wall street is making money off these idiots 
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:59:58
 are you trolling or retarded? If I wrote MOON MOON MOON 50k baby you think that's quality content, but showing any signs of disagreement of skepticism you want to things banned? Why even have a discussion, why not just spam I \&lt;3 Bitcoin and Lambo or stare at the same memes all day.  
I get that you're personally invested and only want to hear good news but that's no way to have a discussion. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:15:39
Why are you pretending bitcoin value crashing and market value is unrelated to adoption rates? Bitcoin doesn't exist in a vacuum just for enlightened neckbeards. 
 
Bitcoin's volatility and price falling right now affects mass adoption. We already saw plenty of places turning away bitcoin. The public's views on crypto (whether or not you think they're all idiots) are all significant. 
As for the advice whether one should sell or hold their coins is one based on its market value, not how passionate you are about the technology or your personal fantasies about leaving US paper money forever. Selling at 19k, 15k, 10k are objectively the better decision than holding until now. Even if you love bitcoin so very much, selling at higher prices wouldve allowed you to buy more bitcoins with the profits. That's what the advice is about, it is making a prediction (again no one knows for certainty) that the current value of bitcoin will fall lower than right now. It doesn't mean give up bitcoin and future potential forever, you could certainly buy back more later.

Stop buying bitcoin. What makes you think you can time the markets now especially if you have first hand experience with buy high, sell low
@_date: 2018-03-29 19:51:00
Which is a shit accomplishment. What has crypto accomplished from 2015 to 2017 besides making few early adopters and whales money. No value was created just transfered from a larger pool to smaller
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:49:49
Yes. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:27:30
There are already newer technology trying to create a better cryptocurrency. Do you not worry about Bitcoin will be outdated tech in 20 years?
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:58:30
Even now, your instinct to sell at the bottom and wanting to buy back  at the first sign of slight recovery of a single day (which could very well be a bull pump) is not a good indicator of judgment to partake so soon. It also sounds like you're motivated by the embarassment to fix the wrong, which is a classic gambling mindset. 
Given your losses, would you buy bitcoin at 16.5k again if it eventually rises? That's something to think about if you expect that price to go higher anytime soon.
Anyways you should realize that the technology hasn't changed from when you bought it near ATH and sold at bottom. What did happen was other people, wealthy people made even more money off your desire to be part of the bitcoin money.

Wouldn't its volatility hurt the adoption? Where are the rapid adoption you see? 
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:24:57
to balance out the zealous belief that it will always go up which might lead to bad impression/investment for newcomers. 
most comments are worthless, don't give too much thought
@_date: 2018-03-17 16:16:09
Uh what do hodlers seek to accomplish?
@_date: 2018-02-08 16:49:11
saying it can still drop is just a simple fact, not a personal celebration of other's misery. 
@_date: 2018-04-18 05:49:28
Did you expect bitcoin to repeat 2017 every year? Were you expecting 100k bitcoin this year
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:31:31
Value and features are not the same . a lot of things are shiny and metallic. They do not have same value which is determined by what market decides.
@_date: 2018-04-18 11:52:09
Over just bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:25:32
 just outdated 
@_date: 2018-04-09 13:10:12
it was 6700 a day ago, it's called pump n dump 
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:25:22
That's an intrinsic feature not value. What gives that value? How do you quantify that value?
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:14:58
Bitcoin isnt the only crypto that can do this. Theres no intrinsic value, thr value comes from the market
@_date: 2018-04-10 14:44:31
is that what you think? That Americans only have dentists? lolwut
@_date: 2018-04-15 13:13:22
I think its other way around these days
@_date: 2018-04-24 05:34:55


as opposed to all the other cryptos in the market ? 
@_date: 2018-04-06 21:10:01
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:20:29
I agree that its the most widely accepted and safest. Thats not what intrinsic means. Value coming from being widely accepted isn't intrinsic. Do you not understand?
@_date: 2018-04-11 16:13:29
How do we " know " this or do you mean hope for it
@_date: 2018-04-07 02:56:04
Are you guys that stupid or intentionally trying to bait newbies. Its been bear season for awhile, yet another endless pump before dump doesn't mean its suddenly moon season
