I personally love blockchain.info and would stop using if they changed. I think it's one of the best there is. I've been with them since day 1 and never had any issues.

They found the flaw, patched it, and refunded the users affected. That's exactly how I want a company to be managed and to grow and move forwards.  
In this same article:


Does that mean Android is literally shit? No. It just means that software has flaws. All of it. Even your prefer wallet, whatever that is, has, or will have, a flaw - all you can hope for is that it's identified before it does too much damage (Blockchain did this), patch it (Blockchain did this) and compensate those affected by the flaw (Blockchain did this).  
The second 'flaw' was an update that went sideways. Again, quickly identified, all affected users notified and compensated if needed.  
I blame the third flaw equally on users, Blockchain.info and their developers. How so? Let's see:
"The flaw apparently came about through a series of bad development choices which all failed in the worst way possible. Bitcoin wallets are typically created by randomly generating a public address and a related private key. As a result, it is important for address and key to be truly random, or else it may be possible to guess the private key by looking at the public address."
The 'bad' choices were in the most part dependant both on outside pressure and just that, a bad choice, which nobody could have known in my mind. Why? Here:
"To that end, Blockchain used two sources of random numbers, in what ought to have been a belt-and-braces approach: it pulled a random number from the Android operating system’s built-in random number generator, and then connected to online service Random.org to get a second random number, which it combined with the first."
See, Blockchain.info tried to make sure they don't fuck up the random number generator, even if Android's one is fucked up. So they said screw it, we'll use two sources.  
"Unfortunately, on some Android phones (reportedly including devices from the Sony Xperia range), the built-in random number generator failed to report back to the blockchain app. Normally, this should have been survivable, because the app used a second source of random numbers."  
The way I see it, they actually did have a backup source for a random generator, and were prepared. They just weren't prepared for both points to fail in the same time, as follows:
"But on 4 January, Random.org strengthened the security of its website, requiring all visits to be made over an encrypted connection. The blockchain app, however, continued to access the site through an unencrypted connection. So rather than getting a random number, as expected, it got an error code telling it that the site had moved."
I see no problem here.  All I see is a very dedicated team which for better or worse, contributed quite a lot to getting Bitcoin where it is today. I'm grateful for it, and use their services because time and time again they have proven to be reliable and trustworthy. Have there been bumps on the road? It would seem so - but they have an outstanding reputation of honesty and trustworthiness. That's what I want from my web wallet.  
If and when it becomes shit or dates, and the team have lost motivation and interest, then sure, I'll look at other options. Until then, I've went through 14 major wallets and none of them has proven to be as stable and fully-featured as Blockchain. Mycellium comes close, but it's too complicated, ugly and barebones for the average user. I do use it sometimes, but I always go back to Blockchain. I need a web interface - it's a hot wallet.  
Just don't keep more than what you would normally spend in a month in a hot wallet, and you'll be alright.

The only problems it had were with people not securing their account correctly.
I mean it's obvious: There's no point in you setting 2FA on your account if your fucking email is not 2FA and you enabled email backups...
Apparently that was blockchain's fault? Screw that. Blockchain has been amazing, I love the fact that they haven't gone full retard and joined the HD wallet clusterfuck.
@_date: 2016-04-05 14:57:54
True. All these are valid points. Using random.org is... just... random (no pun intended). Maybe they had their reasons, maybe not.  
All I'm saying, this isn't enough to disqualify Blockchain for me. The way they handled it afterwards just solidified my devotion to them.

A wallet should be independent from your money the same way a traditional wallet is independent from your bank.
Coinbase and Circle are banks first. They allow you to purchase said coins. Do not store and transact Bitcoin through them. Buy your coins and move them right away to your real wallet.
Mycellium, Greenbits, Airbitz, BITX, blockchain.info, etc - these are what a wallet actually is.
These were the actual, first, real web-based wallets which allowed you to store, send and receive bitcoin.
Bitcoin was bought in an exchange and sent to the wallet, like in real life.
Then Coinbase and Circle came along and offered both a way to buy coins and keep them there.
But we already learned our lesson from the exchanges: never keep your coins online with your exchange.
So, learn from our past mistakes: don't mistake financial services that allow you to buy bitcoin with a wallet.
A wallet is simply a way for you to keep your coins that you bought through other means. It is exactly what its name and real life counter part means: a wallet.

They don't even make an effort to display their trading margins and prices before creating an account. No thanks. 
@_date: 2015-12-27 23:17:06
A wallet is a wallet and a purchase service is another thing. You shouldn't merge the two. Coinbase and Circle are a business and a purchase service first and a bitcoin storage medium i.e a wallet second.
Buy bitcoin separately from where you store it. Use blockchain.info wallet or greenbits or mycellium.
Contrary to what others have to say against blockchain.info, it's still the best one for me. Love the fact that it isn't HD and that it has a Web interface too, unlike mycellium.
In any case, it doesn't matter that much what you go with, but don't use coinbase or circle as both your wallet and your way of getting bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-12-29 14:41:48
Yes. You are doing something wrong. You are trying everything under the sun except the one thing that has always been the default way to get into bitcoin big or small. A proper bitcoin exchange.
 or  
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:05:24
You want to get Bitcoin from an exchange, not a financial service that acts like a bank.
@_date: 2015-12-19 09:05:51
I personally use blockchain.info since day one. I have tried every single wallet under the sun and have not found a better complete service (not just a mere app).
No HD is an absolute blessing. I absolutely hate HD wallets with a passion.
I will continue to use blockchain.info for the foreseeable future.

And if 'your wallet' is a paper wallet? What about my coins then?
I'm afraid I'll go to bed and my cold storage stash will become useless over night.
@_date: 2015-12-29 23:42:34
Use kraken.com or bitstamp.com - they have both been around for way before Coinbase even existed and they are an actual exchange, not a financial service with the tantrums of a bank.
They also have never been hacked, floundered or have had any negative reviews.

Tell him that when Bitcoin is at 100k, you won't have to sell...
@_date: 2017-01-01 23:07:48
What the guy about not taking advice from us said. However, I think we can still say this: even though you think you've missed out by not buying at $1 or at $50 or at $100, if you start buying now, you're pretty much still very much an early adopter, just like the rest of us. I have started buying at $300 and I've continued to buy upwards, downwards and then upwards again. I've made the last purchase a few hours ago at $1000.
While I can't tell you 'invest' or 'don't invest' I just told you what I'm doing.
I'll tell you the catch too: I consider any bitcoin as 'lost money'. I don't think of it as part of my stash, and I certainly don't rely on them and would have zero to lose if bitcoin disappeared tomorrow - in fewer words: don't invest that which you are not willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-01-05 15:53:38
I bought when BTC was 1200... the last time. I've been hodling ever since.
@_date: 2016-12-29 21:38:57
Yeah sure buddy. If you say so.

Tried to raise the same subject a few days ago here:  got downvoted to hell, branded as a troll and a liar and called all kinds of names. Frankly it's weird - the fees have increased ten-fold but there's like a hive-mind going on here where if you even dare mention it, you're done...
Something happened and I personally lost all trust in Bitcoin as a payment system. It might have its applications in the future, but with 0.25$ fees for a $1 coffee... ain't nobody got money for that.
@_date: 2016-11-27 13:32:36
I've always known this was to happen to be honest. I just did not expect it to happen so fast and with fees so high. I was expecting this to happen when Bitcoin was a lot more mainstream. It will not survive with £1 TX fees, not at this point. No way.
People here can call me stupid or troll all they want, but nobody will pay £1 TX fees to buy a coffee that costs just as much. That's ridiculous.
I made my coins mining on non-dedicated equipment until it was no longer viable to do so. I buried them and forgot about them (that was the whole point). This is me coming back - shocked to find that I can't spend them without paying insane fees. Might as well just spend them in one go. I'm putting them up on Bitstamp tonight and I'm done with this chapter of my life. Back to fiat, this one experiment I consider a fail - not that it will disappear, maybe I'm wrong, but the use case I had in mind for it (mainstream adoption especially in poor areas of the world) is now no longer viable with £1 TX fees - that's like... quite a bit of money for some parts of the world.
@_date: 2016-11-27 16:09:38
Yes, I am aware of the prices. That doesn't mean I also pay those prices. I personally don't drink coffee unless it's free.

ARM has TrustZone - same shit as Intel's ME but with a different name. No go.

Live alone. Buy in bulk. I average at £0.16 per portion of noodles, £0.21 if it includes a bit of beef. I grow my own vegetables, have my own chickens. I buy only the necessary basic stuff that it would be too expensive for me to produce (sugar, flour, etc.). I use very little and rely a lot on compots and jams that I make myself.

Wi-Fi can be on when you have airplane mode activated dude. Chill out. Test it yourself. It gets turned off when you first activate airplane mode but you can turn it back on.

Oh I like the part where they say 'if we made you have nothing, go put more money in!'
