soo...this is actually good news?
@_date: 2014-01-16 17:36:02
Who are you quoting? I'm confused

So, I actually went to the website of this bank (skatbank, so it's named after a cardgame btw, wtf?) and it pays normal amounts of interest but there is one particular type of account you can chose where you you get a -0.25% interest rate but only if you put more than three million(!) euros into that type of account, and then they will inform you in advance and propose alternatives. I'd assume that there are certain parts of german law, particular concerning taxation, that would cause this kind of set up with "fines" for higher investment in those types of bank accounts. Imo this piece of news is way overblown. I'm kinda drunk sorry if this was incoherent.

I really don't understand why there are no widerspread bans coming against bitcoin. If I were the establishment I would work on getting people in prison asap. Cryptos will enable tax evasion without the usual need to have enough capital to grease the wheels. Just to be clear, I'm ecstatic about that.

I still haven't seen an easy and reliable way to get actual bitcoins in exchange for dollars.

Did you make the anime chick? Impressive boob physics.

Evolutionary biologists aren't in wide disagreement on the fundamental workings of their field with no way of quantifying the viability of one approach over the other.

Wow this hilarious. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:15:53
So no easy way to get bitcoins anonymously?
@_date: 2014-04-18 19:27:09
Really? The framework seems less than solid with all the exploits and other issues. There is still a lot of work to be done.
@_date: 2014-02-07 20:56:51
Gonna go against the grain here and say this whole thing leaves a bad taste in my mouth. 
@_date: 2014-04-19 05:03:19
I used to be super enthusiastic about maidsafe but their cryptic approach to public relations and just answering basic questions turned me off of them. And that part of the code is apparently closed and hidden.

If those ATMs accept cash then you're totally anonymous though.

is going full bioshock. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:19:02
Lol my first thought as well

I took 2 years of econ and I think the complexity of the economic system is too high for anyone to make reliable predictions, thus invalidating the majority of macroeconomics.

I agree with his assessment that anonymity in transactions would be a good feature but I'm disappointed he buys into that tired old rhetoric of us vs them and the 99%.
Edit: to clarify, it's not rich vs. poor it's government vs. people.

 is marked as untrusted by firefox, just fyi.
@_date: 2014-04-06 04:10:26
that's adorable

Krugman is far less untouchable than you think, you should at least recognize the positions of the Austrian economists and not argue from authority. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 20:14:31
Hah. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 13:52:50
aww. Well, sooner or later something decent will show up. The demand is there.
@_date: 2014-08-08 10:49:06
what about maidsafe?
@_date: 2014-01-17 06:08:20
The same argument could be made for all other ebay transactions. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:10:42
Yeah that title is awful.

r/bitcoin may be shit but so is the list of banned keywords is long and scary:
