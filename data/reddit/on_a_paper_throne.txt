You must be new, it has quite a few times. Upgrades had previously been done via what would be called forks today.
Two notable hard forks were :
12 March 2013, a bitcoin miner running version 0.8.0 of the bitcoin software created a large block that was considered invalid in version 0.7

Look at your browser, how many tabs do you have open, how long did it take to open them. Each tab is over 1.5 MB on average. The memory required for chrome is 1-1.5GB with a few tabs open.
If your PC cant run a node with large blocks you probably shouldn't be browsing the net with it.
Large blocks don't increase centralization.
The lightning network does lead to centralization.
A transaction is needed to get on and a transaction is needed to get off the lightning network. Two transactions for each user. As lightning network hubs will generate fees it is likely hub operators will run nodes. 
Looking at the force graph on the lightning network testnet. There is already some centralization occurring, large central hubs are forming . ( click force graph)
 Those large centralized hubs are forming even now when there is no barrier to entry. How do you think it will develop when there are capital and hardware costs required to set up a lightning hub? Can you guarantee 24/7 up time on your home PC because that's what is required.

To get started using your own money on the lightning network you need an on chain transaction, it will be a large fee like it is now. Your funds are then locked and only usable on the lightning network.
Large hubs will route your payments using their locked funds. They will require a fee, probably small.
The hub can only service so many open channels.
As long as your channel is open your funds and the hubs funds that it is using during this process  will be locked. 
The channel needs to be routed, it needs capital to support it and it also needs to be monitored 24/7. 
That is a service.
Using a one off fee during this process the hubs funds allocated to you in support of your channel are also locked and they are not making money. The fees won't be a one off, they will likely become a subscription service or interest rate, much like a the lending going on at Bitfinex. 
How many of us are going to lock funds in lightning to make micro-payments that we are charged a secondary fee for?
You have $100 of bitcoin, pay a $20 on chain transaction to get on the lightning network, then pay  2% or more of whats left to hubs so they route your payments and don't prematurely close your channel before you are ready.
It doesn't need to scale to 10 million , because it won't have that many users.

There have been two block size increases already, each taking a different path.
The fork that must not be named and segwit.
You need to choose, choose wisely.

No we had a more cohesive community with less animosity and aggression.
The community reverted to version 0.7 then skipped version 0.8 and carried on as if nothing happened.


It isn't pre-mined and it isn't an alt . 
It's a fork.
I believe you know this , you are just expressing your animosity and aggression.

There is also no standard implemented for signing a message.
