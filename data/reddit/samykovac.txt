anybody cares to explain, why steemit could not use bitcoins? but instead had to invent their own "steem" ... smells much like onecoin and many others :-(.

great video. I like the analogy of "What would you hire bitcoin for? What it can do for you? " Everybody should be asking these questions ...

I am European and Gyft works for me OK ;-). You can eventually use a generic e-mail like Hotmail and even invent a country of residence when registering, they do not check it.

He he he, imitation is the highest form of flattery. Tokens? They stole the idea from bitcoin. Even if bitcoin will not replace credit card industry, it sure forces them to innovate. Unfortunately, as mentioned in one of the comments, we - customers - will at the end pay for the innovation :-(.

I just had a payment reversed, that I send to Bitcurex exchange in Poland. I use Tatra Banka in Slovakia, which is part of Raiffeisen group. They only said that it was not executed "based on internal policy of the bank" and even charged me a fee of 15 EUR. I filled official complaint, so far no response. I will let you know if I have any news.
EDIT: My payment reference included word bitcoin. But it was not my first payment to Bitcurex, and it always included word bitcoin. My last successful payment to them was 2 weeks ago. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 17:56:59
me too ;-)
it works worldwide, except for buy/sell, that needs a US account or CC.
@_date: 2014-02-12 02:56:58
cool, and of course 3% bonus applies to every purchase in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-02-26 19:07:11
I got it also :-(. I see a bigger risk than e-mail leaks ... they have copy of my ID etc. which they required for verification :-o.
@_date: 2014-02-20 19:31:40
I see one crucial difference. Paypal as payment system depends on one company, Paypal :-o. Bitcoin is distributed / decentralized. So there is more competition and much more space and incentive for innovation. I think bitcoin will grow and mature much faster than Paypal did ;-)
@_date: 2014-04-07 19:52:38
I think it is legit, but not the first one out there. I have visa debit card from Bitcurex eur.bitcurex.com . They don't sell it anymore, but mine works great and should be good until expiry date :-o. Recharge takes max. 24 hours. I sell BTC and they fund it with EUR. Works worldwide.
@_date: 2014-09-25 21:56:57
I see, thanks. I will check it out.
EDIT: The site is work in progress. Better give them some time and wait for official announcement.
@_date: 2014-04-04 06:21:23
I saw it on BTC China FB account as well, it is legit. So we can finally take a deep breath and rise again ;-)
@_date: 2014-09-22 03:46:21
He has more things wrong ... there is not a market where you can borrow BTC and short it ... what about bitfinex? many people make money these days shorting bitcoin. and "open order book where you can see the stops". that is nonsense. yes, people try to guess the stops and trigger them, but they are not visible. I agree, that he pushes his gold agenda more that he gives reasonable talk about bitcoin. that is sad. ... and gold is down as well, how about that?
@_date: 2014-10-14 04:25:37
Nice. OP should also check out  for Mexico.
@_date: 2014-02-03 04:02:16
also merchants like  offer 3% off (in points) when paying with Bitcoin. so if you discount 1% premium, you still save 2% :-o.

look nice, but the prices are worse than at localbitcoins? needs much more liquidity to be viable option. good work though and good luck.

Well, I am not based in US, so I do not have to do all this bullshit calculations. Does it even apply when paying abroad? And as far as the value goes, yes, the planet earth counts in USD, right? I mean, in many third world countries bitcoin is better protection for your wealth than national currency. I understand that this analogy has its flaws, but still I like it.
@_date: 2014-09-27 01:44:45
I checked WSJ, FT, NYT ... nobody is reporting this news. Another proof the media are bought as well.
@_date: 2014-10-15 01:27:37
cool, and when paying with bitcoin, you get 3% cashback ;-).
@_date: 2015-05-22 23:41:29
Nice article. I had similar idea ... make bitcoin "default currency" on Ebay, or preffered one with nice discount and there you have a reason for milions of people to use it. I know there is Purse.io, but people somehow tend to trust "brand names".
@_date: 2015-05-20 05:22:08
I am curious, it the chip will have the bitcoin address hardcoded? That coudl rise privacy problems ... I mean, if I use my device for authentification, all my movements will be forever recorded on blockchain etc.

You could also set up an ad to sell bitcoins for mexican pesos and with a little patience you will get even better rate than volabit.

Try  , it works and the company is listed there. Funny thing is that ADVCASH also has a russian version of the site. And Belize, well, I wonder how much they are in fact regulated there? :-o. I would not trust them with too much money, but I am willing to try them out. Except they want my passport etc. and I am not sure I want my ID to end up in Belize somewhere :-(.

similar service is available in Mexico:  , withdrawals are possible at thousands of BBVA Bancomer ATMs.
@_date: 2016-01-22 05:25:25
I think their job is to confuse and misinform public. Their profits are on the line here. With bitcoin, who needs banks?
And by the way, with bitcoin you can also just "tap and go" or scan a qr code and go. How much faster is that then swipe and sign a paper voucher ... I mean, paper!
@_date: 2015-01-18 03:50:57
yes, this is nice to see. bitcoin = gold 2.0 ;-). But Mike should remember, that if his does not hold his private keys, it is not his bitcoin. looking at you, coinbase, circle, etc.

Excellent discussion, highly recommended.
@_date: 2017-03-22 01:22:35
My thoughts exactly. The only way to destroy bitcoin is to destroy the people's trust in it ... mess up with the comunity, spread the FUD, and above all, make the price crazy volatile (by spreading the FUD). Becasue you can not really argue with the code and math, you have to target people ... users and developers alike. But we will stay strong! :-)
@_date: 2017-03-27 02:30:17

What is the point of backing the currency by gold? the fact that you can not create more gold "out of thin air". But we already have a gold-like currency - bitcoin. Nobody can create bictoins "out of thin air". If only more people would understand that ...

I wonder if the brought with them enough EUR cash to keep the bitcoin ATM full and refill it when needed. Because they are not goining to be able to get EUR cash in Greece, that is for sure.
@_date: 2016-02-16 01:42:02
The 500 EUR note was useless anyway. No store would accept it, and if you try and deposit a big stack of them in a bank or change for smaller bills ... bank would probably call the police :-o. 500 bills only circulated among certain kind of people ... but if you would want to get it out of that circle, good luck. You can not cut it in 5 pieces and make it into 100 bills :-(.
Bitcoin on the other hand is perfectly divisible, and usable for anything and everything. May be "certain circles" will understand this fact and switch from 500 bills to bitcoins :-o. It will save them many troubles. I mean, you can take 1 BTC and cut it in pieces and then pay for a coffe or airline tickets or whatever :-).
@_date: 2016-02-03 02:33:11
As always, it will have no effect on money laundering and terrorist financing ... banks and USD are the preferred methods for both uses ... not tiny bitcoin (per market cap). But it will erode our privacy even more :-(. EU seems to be moving further and further towards totalitarian state ... Former Soviet Union will look like paradise ... KGB did not have wholesale surveilance ... no internet, no cellphones at that time ... sad news.
@_date: 2017-04-27 02:04:27
the price did not drop (yet), so no profit on shorts but definitely suspicious.
@_date: 2016-09-26 16:37:43
I think there is an ATM: 
@_date: 2016-09-05 03:31:58
And now banks are using them because it is easier than filling all the fileds in the bank transfer info ;-).

"The price of bitcoin reached $607.31 on Tuesday, almost triple its value a year ago, according to CoinDesk Bitcoin Price Index."
Did Bloomberg really say that? :-o It is true, of course, but mainstream media usualy don't publish positive stuff about bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-09-15 04:04:15
well, that is difficult task. would you have used iTunes encrypted backup, it may have worked ... you did not write down the long strings that you are supposed to type in when adding new entries to Google Authentificator, did you? :-( you may have to resolve it with each service then via some kind of "lost my 2FA" link or so.
@_date: 2016-09-05 01:16:43
Sure, that is my point as well. To use this "pay by square", one as to sign up with them etc. While bitcoin QRs are open source protocol, so much better than this clone. But on the other hand, it shows that banks are watching bitcoin closely ... and for a bank customer that will get used to scanning QRs, it is very little step to start using bitcoin ;-). The future is bright.

@_date: 2015-04-20 05:13:15
There is one other strong incentive to cash out - price volatility. By the time the dispensary will go and purchase materials and services, the bitcoin they hold may loose 10-20% of value/purchasing power. So ... unless there is an uptrend in price ... or materials and services are priced directly in bitcoin ... there will be no closed loops, everybody will still cash out, just in case ... and buy back later ... or use bitreserve.org ... or ???
@_date: 2015-09-11 00:41:43
I did not like this in the article:
"But ultimately this question of the public Bitcoin blockchain versus a private permissioned ledger is somewhat like VHS versus Betamax, Ludwin says. In the long run no one will remember or care."
Of course everybody will care. It is wrong comparision. It is about open vs. closed, not closed vs. closed as with videos. Sorry to hear that from otherwise bright guy.

that is true, but with certain exceptions ... you have to report it soon enough etc. ... and of course, the victim's time spend trying to resove it ... time is money :-o.
@_date: 2015-09-16 03:45:05
so .. once I but my 100 USD worth of bitcoin in "lock", I loose 0.75 USD, no matter what happens to exchange rate? well, I may just as well keep it in bitcoins and risk that it will go up in value :-o. now the price is really low ;-).
 
on the other hand, here is an interesting use case ... "lock" 100 USD in coinapult, get Gyft app ... and when you need to buy something ... get the 100 USD out, loose 0.75%, buy gift card, get 3% bonus ... so you can use Mycelium / Coinapult as your bank, Gyft sells gift cards for hundreds of shops for your daily shopping, and you get a nice bonus :-).
@_date: 2015-04-05 15:53:38
Good point! ;-).
I noticed that Coinbase does not even state exchange rate on checkout. Only ammount in USD and in BTC, so I have to count it myself :-(.

he he he, and so who says bitcoin is not mainstream enough ;-).
@_date: 2015-09-19 03:34:09
the thing is that bitcoin is pseudonymous and can be almost anonymous if done right. how would government make you divulge all your public addresses? that will be a complete end of financial privacy and so it will never work. on the other hand, if government wants to push it on people, people will demand the same from them, e.g. disclose public addresses of government offices, and then we could see all their movements on the blockchain. what could be better for open society and democracy? :-o. to wrap it up, I think it will never work and people will run to cash and bitcoin. and will avoid all the "private blockchain" nonsense that banks want to promote.

It's all in Polish! :-( Luckily I stopped trading there some time ago ...
@_date: 2015-11-14 16:53:15
I can see a positive side to it ... many people are scared of bitcoins because they hear it is ireversible and "be your own bank" ... but if you by accident send someone 10 000 usd instead of 1000, your bank can help you reverse it ... in most cases anyway ... I think may be even Coinbase can reverse bitcoin (!) transfers between its users ... so this policy is closer to how standard banks work and that may be more user-friendly, so to speak :-o.
@_date: 2017-05-22 03:18:02
may be this run up to $2000 was the insider buying ;-).

it is already possible to do that in Czech republic, buy and sell: 
@_date: 2017-05-20 22:35:13
Strangely it is cheaper to buy with credit card then bitcoin ... why pay 0.5 EUR fee on bitcoin transaction? :-(. Oh and another funny thing is when you buy bitcoin from their ATM and then use it at their online shop, you loose even more because of the difference between the bitcoin sell price at ATM and for how much they take it at the store ... really sad for bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-05-04 22:56:38

I like trezor, and paper wallets. I don't think you need multiple trezors ... if the one you have breaks, you can restore your bitcoins to a new one. Just make sure you have a backup (24 words) stored somewhere safely.
@_date: 2015-10-06 05:50:42
I think they are trying to tap into remittances and such. For migrant workes in the US it is much easier to get bitcoins that credit card. Also, instead of sending money over to Mexico using Western Union or similar service, now they can just buy bitcoins in the US and directly over the internet pay utility bills of their mexican relatives ( and recharge cellphones ( and now also buy household appliances etc. Cost savings are probably important. For Famsa it is also a win, lower processing fees, no chargebacks or problems like "billing address is in US, but shipping address in Mexico" . Congratulations and good luck. I hope more businesses will join the "mexican bitcoin wave" :-).
@_date: 2016-05-05 00:22:03
Yes, the 500 EUR is basically useless ... you can only hoard it or deposit it in the bank ... or use it to pay in cash for shady stuff :-o.
