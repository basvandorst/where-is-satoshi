Don't let me discourage you since what you're doing is probably right. I will just take a second here to vent about the airgapping and paper walleting.
&lt;vent&gt;What all these precautions tell me is that people do not trust their own computers. They assume they are compromised or may become so.
It's like, it's ok if a robber is walking around my house, watching me sleep at night, checking out my pr0n collection, etc., but as long as he doesn't touch me that's fine. NO. It is not OK.
If you cannot trust your own PC then you got bigger problems than where to store your satoshis. I am using my PC for bitcoining for a few years now, and no coins went anywhere. This tells me either that my stash is not big enough to take, or the attacker doesn't want to alert me, they are playing the long con. Because granted, if my bitcoins disappear I'm going to know immediately that this PC is being watched. In fact, I may even welcome this helpful revelation.&lt;/vent&gt;
The rest of you folks please carry on, taking the precautions to silly degrees, epoxying shut ports and so on. I may eat crow one day when I'm hacked, but right now I've got a balance between convenience and peace of mind that works well enough for me.

Just as a quick PSA, Visa and MasterCard are payment processors. They don't issue cards, the banks do. So technically you are not their customer, the banks are.
Example: Chase bank MasterCard card - you are a customer of Chase, Chase is a customer of MasterCard. Got that? Good.
So by closing your CC account with your bank you aren't telling shit to MasterCard. Your bank incurs the expense of finding you as a customer, stamping and mailing you the physical card, etc.
Edit: You don't have to like them but they are just trying to defend their turf. They make money on transactions and see bitcoin as a threat. Things can get ugly, especially when you're talking billions in revenue. Horse buggy whip makers were very much against motor cars too.

And you know this based on some evidence, I'm sure. What are your examples of long-running decentralized and transparent monetary system? There are none.
People's ingenuity is not to be dismissed lightly. Bankers invented CDOs and CDSs and MBSs and sold those things as "products" to relatively intelligent investors, who probably did due diligence research. I have no doubt there are ways to fuck with people's money even in a decentralized and transparent monetary system. It will involve smoke and mirrors and may largely rely on some gullibility, but come on, we just can't assume "decentralized and transparent" to be a clusterfuck free panacea.

The nodes share the blockchain similar to bittorrent (I understand it's not done in quite the same way.) So the question is why did it take an hour to download 23GB boostrap.dat file with bittorrent and then a much much much longer time (many more hours) to download blocks past 317,000 (not counting "importing from disk" time)? Is uploading blocks to other nodes really that poorly optimized?
EDIT: 8333 open. Download is all done (but again, took a while, hence the question). 23 connections to bitcoind right now.

That's not exactly meaningful. Transactions are what's stored into the blocks. And yes, addresses are part of transactions. Assuming you have some old address and it was never used then it doesn't exist in either blockchain yet. You send some coin there, the transaction will land into either the 1mb chain or 20mb chain. When you got the address has no relevance.

Couple things here... so the assumption is that the blockchain is never going away? Devs don't break something in bitcoin? Regulations and zero transaction privacy won't drive away users? Miners don't quit when subsidy rewards dry up? Isn't it a bit premature to assume that bitcoin will still be here 50 years from now?
Second, and probably more pressing point is security of private keys is still an issue. People often show up here whining that their 0.002BTC was swiped or they somehow lost it.

Huge blocks will propagate slower and may not be accepted. Miners still like the block finder reward so they want their solved block to be the first. They will compromise between taking lots of transactions with high fees and limiting block size, or lose out on both.

Hash of (some data about previous block, plus data about transactions in mem pool, plus randomly selected number) needs to match some criteria, i.e. leading zeroes. This is hard to do and this is proof of work.
Verifying that the hash value matches the criteria is one hash operation, very fast and easy, once the randomly selected number is known. Verifying that the block is correct is not the proof of work. A tiny 300MH/s USB miner can verify every block in existence in 1/1000 of a second.

I was surprised to learn about Universal Basic Income a while ago. Free money, what a concept!
So, let's see how much $ do we need? Before calculating that, need to determine who is eligible. Are there age cutoffs? i.e. does a 3 year old get money? same amount as a 30 year old? Do you have to be a citizen? Do you have to have a "UBI card," i.e. properly registered into the system? Do you have to prove worthiness in any way? Can you read, for example? What if you can't? Let's get ridiculous - user without legs does not need to buy socks and shoes - is their income lower? or higher because of the disability?
So, ok we're down to 300 million qualified people out of 320 million.
$1000 per month - that's 3.6 Trillion dollars a year. That's more than IRS collects in taxes. So 1K per month is not going to work. And $500/month won't even cover rent in many places...

@_date: 2015-08-12 20:12:58
I am not sure exactly what constitutes a full verification of a block to be accepted as valid by the network. If 3000 nodes say it's a valid block, wouldn't pools have no choice but to agree and accept it? How about 30 nodes? 2 or 3 nodes? So I can see what you're saying about creating blocks on top of B'(N) would make a longer chain with more work and thus B'(N) would be "definitely more valid" than B(N) was when it was first advertised. But, there can be seconds to over an hour between blocks. I imagine in some ways this behavior is thwarted, perhaps because it's not profitable in long or short term. Otherwise we would have a few blocks orphaned every day now (maybe we do?).
As for leaving the pool - there are a few choices. Principle - I stick to bitcoin core with its 1MB blocks no matter what. Or economic incentives - I jump to XT with 8MB blocks and it makes sense that majority of other players will jump to this chain as well. I best do it now, as soon as possible. Other players observe the scene and watch as hashpower tanks on Core and explodes on XT, so they too make the choice to move to XT (hypothetically).

Aright, I'm not an economist or investor or any kind of pundit. But look how easy this is:
1) Calculate average cost of production for 10 (or let's say 50) most efficient mines.
2) Add 30% to above cost.
There. I just "valued" it. What's weird about it is googling "cost of gold production" gives me $1200, which is above spot price. I thought only bitcoin miners mine at a loss..

To clarify this, if price goes up, people will invest into more hashing capacity in hopes of profiting, which in turn raises difficulty. Price does not raise difficulty.
Yes, the electricity costs will rise as long as people will believe that they can profit by investing into mining. At some point though, there will be a break even price where adding more mining will not make economic sense. And that point may be where to effectively compete minimum investment is a million dollar facility. Minimum. So there won't be too many takers.

IoT is its own standalone idea and it has nothing to do with bitcoin.
The idea is basically that various objects will have sensors collecting data and sending it somewhere (possibly receiving also). A simplified example would be your fridge sensing milk is going low and adding milk to shopping list on your smartphone. With bitcoin it may even order said milk to be delivered by a local grocery courier the next day.
It probably won't involve random items talking to each other over the Internet for no reason. Your toaster is not going to start an online relationship with the microwave. But these appliances could sense needing repairs or some other attention, and communicate this somewhere to a central hub, where information is then processed, made useful, and presented in an attractive way to you, the owner.

No. This conclusion is wrong. It does not cost this much in electricity. The electricity cost is relatively fixed over mid to long term. It only goes up if more hashing capacity is added or power co bumps up rates. If bitcoin price doubles in a month it does not at all mean that now miners are spending twice as much on electricity as they did a month ago.
Also, mining is not done to mine bitcoins, it's done to confirm transactions. Initial distribution of coins to miners is a bootstrap incentive. Smart people went from CPU mining to GPU mining to ASIC mining, a progression which by some accounts was not foreseen by anyone, even Satoshi. If bitcoin is around for the long haul, there may be geothermal, wind, solar, or other renewable energy solutions. At some point hashing speed may stabilize where no one would be incentivized to add more, thus difficulty will be stable, and power costs to run hashing equipment will be fixed with only minor variations.

As satisfying it would be to cancel some cards and bitch out the evil banks for their usurious practices, a couple reasons to keep cool (among many):
1. Most likely you're going to talk to a person who is just doing their job, unhappy with their own shitty lot. Your tongue-lashing about the FED and corporations owning this country's politicians, etc., are going to fall on deaf ears at best or just aggravate another human being who may even agree with you (but bills gotta be paid, so they are working the phones at cust serv @ whatever bank), at worst.
2. They do have on file: all your info, name, address, dob, social security  purchase history, and so on. They can ruin your credit history, they can put a star next to your customer record ("upload this one straight to NSA/FBI" star) and you may get some unwanted attention.
So if you're going to close your cards, be polite, say you got too many cards and trying to organize your accounts or whatever. 
Don't close your oldest card if you are young (under 35 lets say), that one is good for you "length" of credit history.

Please review. 
Solving a block is kind of a misnomer. It's more of a "guess the value that will hash to a certain other value." So all miners guess, by taking some known values adding in their guess, then hashing all of that. If the resulting hash meets certain criteria, that's the winning guess.
Hashing functions are one way, they are irreversible in practice. The network currently tries 3.4 peta guesses per second. Brilliant minds can't really compete. Although a better algorithm for the nonce vs trying every possible value might help.

I have placed small orders with localbitcoins.com and with coinbase.com in the last few days. Will return soon and post results.
Edit1: Coinbase.com, signed up. Logged in. Went to my bank website and changed password to temporary string. Allowed bitcoin to Verify bank account using my login ID and this password. Changed bank password back to my own. Verified phone. Bought some coins. All on day one. However, wait for the first batch of coins is 4 days. Cannot place any other orders until first order completes.
Edit1.5 After first coinbase order is done you can place multiple orders. Still must wait 4 business days to get coins. My first order for about $450 was cancelled by the system - marked as high risk. The order was cancelled when I was expecting to get the coins, so 4 days waiting. Not cool. Smaller orders have gone through though and now I've bought 5.1 coins at once as the largest order.
Edit2 : Doing a cash by mail deal on localbitcoins.com using their Escrow to hold the coins. Put cash into envelope, mailed it. The seller has good feedback, 100% rating. Responds to messages. So far so good. Unfortunately cannot place any other Escrow type orders until this one completes.
Edit3: Seller on localbitcoins.com released escrow and I got my coins minus 0.003BTC fee as localbitcoins.com states. This service works. This was my first coin and with postage and all the hassles ended up costing me quite a bit. I was still glad to get it.
Edit4: Also looking into  although can't recommmend at the moment - devs are currently in the process of patching the code so the site has been down. Must use TOR to access.
Edit5: Another service I started using is campbx.com I like it quite a bit though getting cash into it is through money orders and that is kinda slow so forget jumping on a shor term deal if account has no funds in it.

Blockchain stores inputs and outputs of transaction. For my bitcoins to exist in my address they had to have come there from some other address or from block reward. The blockchain that I want to be the "right one" is the one where the inputs into my addresses are stored. Those could be inputs form transactions with which I've managed to triple-spend into my own addresses multiplying the balances. Yeah this would have to be super quiet with only the pool owners and the wealthy attacker in the loop.

"One service didn’t work. It simply returned the same Bitcoins, un-laundered."
What? There is no way to uniquely identify a "bitcoin" unit. Bitcoins don't even exist. There are unspent inputs and spent outputs in a transaction. The transactions are linked with addresses. The input in your address is augmented by the amount received. You never get "the same" bitcoins in any transaction. It's not like they are numbered.

Why is multibit not an option? No blockchain download (except if importing undated private keys).
Put password on the wallets and then backup your .wallet files (not compatible with wallet.dat type) for safekeeping. Wallet files store your private keys along with addresses you sent payments to and labels you've given to them. If you don't necessarily need those labels, export just the private keys (every time you add new receiving addresses) in encrypted format and backup those separately (can always import those privkeys into a new wallet after reinstall of the OS)

There is a 7 transactions per second limit. That's a max rate of 604,800 transactions per 24 hours (7x60x60x24). Not needing any particular confirmation speed I set the fee in my client to 0.0001. That's 60.48 BTC in fees per 24 hours. This can vary as some clients set the fee higher to 0.0005 and some micro-transactions don't have fees at all.
Mining today at nominal rate of 6 blocks per hour finds 144 blocks per day. That would be 3600 BTC in daily reward at current 25BTC / block rate.
Daily transaction fees (60.48BTC) are looking to surpass daily block reward (56.25) sometime around block 1470000 (when reward halves to 0.390625BTC/block), which given rough estimate of 6 blocks per hour will happen in 23.5 years. (Current block discovery rate appears to be higher than nominal, so that's an approximation.) It is estimated that final bitcoins will be rewarded around the year 2140.

Buying a mining contract has nothing to do with your computer. It is specifically meant for "other people's equipment" to do the mining. They own the equipment, they mine with it, they (in theory) pay you your share. As others stated, there is no guarantee you will be paid, there is not really much of a recourse if you are not paid, and most companies selling mining contracts don't have the equipment in place yet. They are selling you future risk for up-front cash. By the time they will be set up and running 2GH may be producing pitiful amounts of BTC per day; most likely not enough to earn back what you paid, let alone make a profit.

Because every day more and more people want to get in on the game, and add their mining equipment to the pool, the difficulty adjusts higher to maintain the nominal 1 block/10 min block generation rate. Difficulty rises every 2 weeks. Equipment turned on today will generate bitcoins for some time until the network hashrate will become so high as to make the equipment obsolete. At current BTC price a $6000 dollar 2TH box has an approximate max lifespan and max profit of $18K. If you could get one, that is. And guarantee the price of BTC will not drop below $195 when you sell it. And guarantee the difficulty will not adjust at rates much higher than predicted. All those variables affect the outcome. So how many $6000 boxes can you afford to throw in now and keep adding as you go along? That's even if you could get one of those.. shipping estimated for January 2014.

Low volume is better for buyers, the coins are cheaper than on coinbase and trading fees are 0.055% (compared to coinbase 1% + 0.15 bank fee for each transaction). You can also set your own limit price unlike on coinbase and it will trigger the order if price drops to where you set it.

a) this depends on how good your "50 character Passphrase" really is. It also depends on whether you always enter it only on trusted computers so it's never keylogged.
b) that's a pretty good idea. sha256 is a one way hashing algorithm so if you hash your "50 character Passphrase" it is in theory, and currently in practice, not possible to reverse back to your passphrase. I think the danger here is if some folks try to do this to a simple passphrase, like "hi" to get the hashed value and believe that that string is a secure password to use, since it looks so long and random. It is not. Again, same warning about keyloggers or screencaptures. Really good passwords often fall when they are entered in an observed environment.

 wallet is nice. No, it doesn't store the blockchain. They use /dev/urandom for random number generation now since v0.65. If in doubt about random number gen and creating a key on Android device, create an empty wallet with desktop client like multibit or qt then import the private key into the cell phone app. (If you create new wallet instead of importing old you don't drag all the transactions history with it.) Transfers are just as fast as they are with anything else - notification is within seconds, then you need at least one confirmation, 6 to be pretty certain. It takes 3 to maybe 10 minutes to confirm transactions.

Transactions are public and permanent. If you simply transfer from one address to another those two are linked forever. Knowing either new or old address will let someone follow the chain forward or backward. It's not trivial, but there are tools that can assist with this.
When you send to a mixing service, your BTC goes into a pool with everybody else's mixed BTC - murderers for hire, drug dealers, the mafia, everyone who's using the mixing service. Then you withdraw to one of your new fresh clean addresses. If nobody knows it's yours (i.e. you never use it to, say, buy something and have it shipped to your name and address) then you are technically safe. Nobody can reliably prove that you got some some bitcoins out. It's clear that someone did, but can't tell who.

Ebay. You can probably get 2 for that price. 333MH/s is not bad, about 4-5 shares per minute. Consider that pools like eclipsemc currently pay 0.00000064 BTC per share. As others said 1 of these is not going to even pay for itself at half that price.
They get hot. I pulled off heatsinks from chips on an old motherboard and rubberbanded them to the miners. Chugging along, seems to help with the hashrate and lowering HW errors.
You will get some hardware errors, about 1% is ok. Also there will be some rejected shares, about 0.1% is ok. The worst is Segmentation Fault error. The miner software dies and needs to be restarted. If you aren't around, no mining is happening until it's fixed.
BTC value does change, unpredictably - it could drop to $65 again or lower. Mining difficulty, however, increases at a rather noticeable clip - about 20% every two weeks. A large number of these little things were the best you could do a while ago as far as hardware availability. Today, as people adding their 60GH singles to the network, these USB guys can probably make you just enough for an occasional roll with satoshidice :)

The tracking and taxing opportunities are lost.
Let's say Bob earns 300K a year. Pays 35% in federal tax, also add state and local. Let's say Bob's favorite relative hits some kind of good or bad situation and Bob gives them $60K. Gifts up to 10K are tax free I think, but anything over that becomes the relative's "income" and now the relative has to pay income tax on this money, the money that was already taxed(!) when Bob earned it. Simple transfer from Bob to the relative and the gov gets a cut. And if the transfer is in cash, anything 10K and over will be watched when withdrawn and deposited and a CTR will be needed. CTR is a form that will go from the bank to, you guessed it, the government, with all your details, Name/Address/DOB/SS type/shoe size/favorite color.
At least at the moment people shuttle around huge sums of BTC address to address with no taxes and no gov forms. It is very likely that large balance addresses are being watched though, even if they can't be connected reliably to an individual just yet.
USD is reserve currency, so lots of countries recognize it and people there readily accept it for both public and private payments. This means there is a lot of demand for USD everywhere. (Also oil is priced in USD and USA fights wars to ensure that it does, which also keeps demand for USD high since countries wanting to buy oil will need to buy USD first, then buy oil with USD). This high demand ensures high valuation of USD against some other currencies. This is great for imports and bad for exports. USA is a consumer nation so it import way way more than they export. Strong dollar is good. Enter bitcoin. It has all these great features. More and more people use it. Demand for USD falls. USD exchange rate against other currencies starts to fall. Weak dollar is good for exports but USA exports obesity and diabetes (that's a joke, forget where I seen it) so in general success of BTC is a negative for USD.

You're looking at around 500Mh/s so approx $0.25 per 24hr at current exchange rate and difficulty. Power consumption will be about 130 watts extra since mining will run the card at considerable load. That's about ~3Kw per day, which is roughly 10 cents each, depending on where you are. So, you'll generate some heat and kill the card sooner for no gain. Don't do it.

I think the point they are trying to make is that you cannot move a LOT of bitcoin anonymously. I mean so much that someone would bother tracking it. Who cares about your $200 weed order on SR, you know?
Take a big player, someone with, oh let's say 20,000BTC. It would be impossible to move this through TorATM or localbitcoins in a reasonable amount of time. That's just.. a LOT of money! And if you were to try to use bitcoinfog.. now I don't know their volume but if you put in 20,000BTC and take out 19,998 that's certainly clear as day. So you'll break it up, into small irregular chunks, a few coins here, a few coins there... That's a lot of addresses to manage, a few hundred to a thousand of them. Not impossible but still. 
Where are you coins coming from? Does bitcoinfog send you each transaction from a fresh address or from one big honking pool address? If from one address, then all 1000 of your addresses are linked to bitcoinfog (which is immediately suspicious).

Sounds a bit confusing. To clarify, the difficulty can change up 4x at once, but it can change up or down depending on how quickly blocks are being found.
"The adjustment could be as much as 400% up or down; or as little as 0%." Zero percent being the smallest possible adjustment, i.e. difficulty stays the same.
Edit: The above is wrong as others have mentioned. I must have been drunk.
The max increase can be 300% of current which would make the {current + increase} add up to a max of 4 times the current difficulty. The max decrease can be 75% of current which would make {current + decrease} (decrease is negative, obviously) add up to a max of 1/4 of the current difficulty. How's that?

Investors in the trust can only buy baskets of 50K shares, so at $20.09 a pop better get yer checkbook ready to write out a minimum $1,004,500 just to get in. Those investors (banks or registered brokers) are free to float their shares on exchanges in smaller denominations, however.
There are 1M shares, each share is said to be equivalent to 0.2BTC, so the trust better have 200K BTC ready to distribute on demand.
While inaccessibility to private keys (i.e. lost keys) is clearly at the very top of the risks section, the statements conclude with "could adversely affect an investment in the Shares." WTF?

Methinks you're talking about encrypting text, like for example, your shipping address.
In linux (and perhaps cygwin if on Windows)
gpg --gen-key
gpg --export -a &gt; mypublic.key.txt
This mypublic.key.txt file will have first line like this -----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK----- with the rest a bunch of gibberish. This mypublic.key.txt file or its entire contents is what you give to everyone - it's public. The private key will be in your keyring on your PC. If you share your public key, people can encrypt things with it, but only you could decrypt it since only you have the private key. If you post your public key somewhere I'll encrypt a message for you and post it on pastebin or something if you like.
If you want to securely send your address to JoeBob, you need JoeBob's public key. JoeBob needs to give it to you.
gpg --import "JoeBob's key file"
Then you can encrypt messages to JoeBob and only he can read them.
gpg -e -r "JoeBob" -a message-to-joe.txt
The portion after -r is the name on the key or email address - you will see this info right after importing JoeBob's key with gpg --import "JoeBob's key file"

* It does not have to be a concentrated group effort to pull off the attack. It can be one bad player, who either doesn't understand the repercussions, or doesn't care, and destroys things just to be able to double spend a few hundred bitcoins.
* The government's ability to do this is most certainly within realm of possibility. Remember, they print unlimited amounts of money, hire the best people, and can build a chip foundry the size of Intel's, or multiples of those, if they had to.
* Word would get out within days.. The NSA spying thing was kept under wraps for years until Edward Snowden situation.
* Waste of taxpayer money. Well, the government wastes taxpayer money all the time so that's never a reason not to do something. ( every time you see an explosion, that's $1.4 million Tomahawk missile.) Think about it, BTC is replacing taxable currency the gov controls with non-taxable uncontrollable one. BTC with 1.6 billion market cap, and granted most of that doesn't move, but if it did, states miss out on 6% or 7% sales and federal missing out on 35% income tax per year. That's hundreds of millions. If they could spend 100 million on taking over some pools and throwing down their own asic farms to subvert bitcoin, that would be an excellent long term ROI.

Consumer purchasing is 73% of the US economy (ref wikipedia). This is: people buying stuff. A lot of it is staples like food, utilities, meds. And a whole lot of it is shit they don't need. Latest iphones, playstations, big screen TVs, 18HP riding lawn mower for a 1/3 acre backyard to keep up with the Joneses. Credit enables this buying up of stuff. People buy today cause they know they only need to pay the minimum payment on the credit card every month. When things get tough, credit card is used more cautiously, or not at all, thus causing "drop in aggregate demand." To maintain equilibrium, the price points shift down along the supply curve (and this looks like deflation). Maybe if the average consumer only purchased what they needed and not whatever they wanted, the demand and prices would be at their lower equilibrium and there wouldn't be observable "drops" to correlate with recessions and depressions.

In theory, all miners then are subject to same hassles that Mt Gox is experiencing (they failed to get MSB license, so they got accounts frozen, i.e. their funds confiscated). In practice Mt Gox was a much larger, more visible, target.

Yo, it's a fledgling currency mechanism, not a way of life. If I'm into some product or idea, no preaching is generally required.
Drive a ford, use tide detergent. See, kinda silly to be on a soapbox about those. Same with bitcoin. Unless someone asks, don't feel compelled to run out and find converts.

I am very very sorry about using lmgtfy, wanted to try it for soo long and couldn't resist the opportunity.

ECDSA. Break? probably not with current tech. But I imagine they are building rainbow tables of SHA-256 hashed passwords.

I have not used this so can't vouch for it but the idea is slick 
 has a paper wallet tab and those look pretty cool too. With this one you don't give control of the money to some other intermediate party.

Power supply is included, right? Can i get one with red heatsinks?

Could be. Don't know.

Service is finding a proper block to hold transactions that other users make using bitcoin. Without blocks there is no blockchain, without blockchain there is no place to store inputs and outputs to transactions, and without inputs/outputs it's just millions of key pairs where nothing of value is happening.
Eventually when all of the coins are mined (in other words when the BTC payout for finding a block is halved so many times as to be 1/2 of a satoshi which can't split in two due to current system being limited to 8 decimal places) the assumption is that there will be so many transactions that miners will still mine to collect transaction fees. Today the fees represent much much smaller chunk of what miners make. It is way better to find a block and get 25BTC than to just collect 0.0001BTC each to include some transaction into a block. The 7 transactions per second limitation is kind of problematic and somehow will need to be addressed as we get closer to saturating the limit.

I am not arguing the numbers, only the terminology: $133/BTC is not bitcoin's value, it is the current exchange rate. The two are not the same thing. A bottle of water may cost a $1 at the convenience store, but if you are lost in the desert for 2 days you'd be willing to pay ten or twenty times that for that bottle. Same bottle of water, but it is much more valuable to you then.
