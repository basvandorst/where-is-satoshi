This sounds like the perfect application for IBM's rain concept. Everyone downloads the xyz wallet and is promised a rain of Bitcoin at the conference. It really is a cool concept and the best part is users don't need to think or do anything it just happens(location based). The tech will sell itself as valuable and even familiar btc users will be incentivised to dl the wallet for the experience.

i agree with the first part wholeheartedly. Lets get some west exchanges with zerio fees and shake things up. Westerners will be shocked at how nice it is. The problem is how do you make money to fund your exchange and innovate(like okcoin is doing). The answer is VC money. Have the ideal get the funding and figure out longterm profits later.

This is the most impact-full thing I have read in a while. Everything about it is fascinating.

Once the basic income is initiated it will have profound impacts on current prices of everything. Everything will go up for everyone equally because everyone will receive the same amounts. If you have a job this would just be a supplement.
Buying food will be the same as it is now for the poor but they will have more dignity and confidence because they control the aspects of their lives and not the poverty of having no money/options. If you are frugal enough one can climb out of poverty, but this is currently impossible to do for many being unemployed and having no options.
This system would bring on a boon like we have never seen before. Money would be moving around and creating new markets outside and inside the corporate system.
This can be deployed anecdotal in spot locations around the world and proven to work but what about when it's applied to everyone in a geographic area(city/state/country)? That may have a completely different outcome. The value given to the homeless right now in the experiments are worth current value and not future value once prices equalize with inflation. Over time this might just make the amount of money of subsidies worthless(*unless the income increased with inflation).
I think a better option is to give high school students, when they leave school, $5-30k(or more/less depending on where located) to use however they want(most will lose it all), but they had a chance and most of the time it would be their fault if they don't make it in the free market(either business or job skill development or both). This does not fix the current homeless problem but it is a pre-active strategy. update: im not sure how this would work because most people need the fear of not having a job to keep them motivated(too bad for those that are independent i guess).
I can go on and on... This video really got me thinking...

They only allow you to share in the revenue generated from crowd-funding. They don't allow you to own it all, -as with btc. If they setup a way to divide the btc funding that would be innovation.

And ppl wonder why btc-e is as anonymous as possible. Agents will kidnap your family and make you do exactly as they say. Big money makes kings and kings do as they please.

~~I have an update. I signed up yesterday and sent 0.1 btc. After an hour it still showed pending under wallet status so I sent in a ticket. It is now the next day and it's still showing pending status. I'm glad I only sent a testing amount.~~
I just checked again and it now shows complete.

What if you are a government entity that wants to see bitcoin burn? I remember early on ppl were buying bitcoins just to destroy them(anti bitcoiners).

This is probably taken out of context. He could be saying that its a free market and if the big boys corps don't like cryptocoins nothing is stopping them from trying to compete.

The idea of selling and buying back is very appealing because this is essentially what I do on an exchange anyway. This would be a great way to diversify. What are the fees?
If I can get this to work(getting ready to test it) I will never use a btc exchange again. All we need is coinapult and coinbase/circle. This drastically reduces risk by eliminating the need of exchanges(btc/usd) for non daytraders.
I have a feeling this service is going to be very popular.

i tracked it for a few days and did not find it useful. I dont think i know how to read it correctly either.

They need an incentive other than find work or live under a bridge. Some people have skills but do not have a paper confirming those skills and are deemed un hire able. These people would rather look for other means of support than flipping burgers or sweeping floors wasting their skills(they still have pride). They try to compete in the free market but they have no money, so they always lose because its rigged overwhelmingly against them.


Would be giving everyone something for free. In this case it would seam free but only for a while before market forces took place. In the end the poor would have money that they couldn't buy anything with because prices are inflated. This is better than the current situation of having no money. At lease they could save and be frugal to reach a means. 
I suspect this could perpetrate substance abuse, but my stance on that is let everything be legal and everyone wont want it anymore(it will stop being cool like it is now)(who wants to destroy their mind an body)(if they do its because they have nothing else to live for). In the case of producing productive citizens(the cream always rises to the top unless blocked in some way).
-I'm still not convinced that a basic income would be euphorically beneficial for more than an initial period because of economic rules. I also recognize that the current system does not work for everyone and people fall through the cracks. This problem can't be left to the public to solve. All they can say is get a job, because that is what has worked for them.

Let content creators charge for the good stuff and give away the basic stuff. This model works well in games. If you have to pay to unlock a character/items in game you value that character/items much more. This needs to work completely on the blockchain for many reasons(security/abuse).

skullcoin did this a while ago, it still is a good idea.

Rigging the fight. This is a problem in large arenas. A solution is to keep the bets small and friendly. Let the turtle out run the hare. Security in numbers of occurrences. Let the status of the winner be on merit of skill long term and not just on the amount of short term earnings. Also check for 'hw/sw cheats', and the likes, and disqualify ppl when tested positive.(this is arena only - person to person bets would not be restricted)(if arena speculation happens outside of the btc soft escrow wallet then forget about trying to prevent rigging)

This is how non compliance in any fashion is dealt with(not only in Adam's case). Any low opportunity to destroy you is used against you. It's not a fair fight(people generally fight against each other honorably and fairly within disputes. Rulers have no honor and resort to soft kill systems. -Be careful and choose your fights wisely &amp; tactfully.
