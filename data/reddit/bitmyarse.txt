The US government likes bitcoin because it can disrupt the Chinese and Russian economies.  The US is sneaky like that. They have no interest in regulating bitcoin at this point because it does not represent a challenge to the US dollar.

Yeah, don't trust AV, I don't even run it.  I scan my system with hitman pro once a month to check for anything, but for the most part my system is locked down due to how I browse the internet.  You are better off developing internet habits that prevent this type of mischief. 
If you are uncertain about something, then do it in a virtual system.  If anything goes wrong or you are uncertain, then delete the system or roll back to a previous snapshot.

It looks like it is heading that way, which is disturbing as an investor, but forks are not a bad thing as long as it improves the bitcoin protocol.  Imagine the close door meetings that lead to tcp/ip over spx/ipx aka Microsoft/Novell protocol wars. At least this is public and conscience will win eventually.  Hopefully bitcoin is the vhs to betamax.

It is easy to root your Android phone.  Pretty much the first thing most people do.  Most sites recommend it to save battery life.
"these tokens are NOT designed in our app to be secret and have not been granted any extra permission to perform any additional action on our product. We’re aware that they’re published on Github and do not believe this to be a security risk."

@_date: 2014-06-14 01:10:41
Honestly, you are better off mining Peercoin and using BTCe to convert to BTC when the price is right.  I usually make an extra .5 to 1 btc when I trade my mined Peercoins versus mining btc directly.
Maybe ghash should use some of their extra hash to start a Peercoin pool.  Reliability has improved, but it could be better.

uh, so it is a new pool?  If 51% of the hardware hash power joins this node or pool, how does this resolve the current 51% issue?

If one node or operator had control of the hash then it would be no different than the issue we have now.  What is in place to prevent one operator from owning multiple nodes?
@_date: 2014-06-14 02:30:54
Why?  I am suggesting a solution for a reoccurring issue with bitcoin.  I own a good bit of Bitcoins and would like to see its value increase.  I also own Peercoin, Litecoin and several other coins. The solution for PoW and bitcoin is in the alt coins.  The developers just need to wake up and implement something.

@_date: 2014-06-14 00:42:33
Agreed, I still can't wrap my mind around the fact that people who probably don't mine with any significant investment, single out miners and a pool for deficiencies in PoW. Why are they not bitching at the developers to come up with a solution?
Do they really think that an organization with billions in reserves (Apple, Google, Amazon, Microsoft, IBM, etc) and a vested interest in seeing bitcoin fail so that they can promote their own digital currency will just play nice because the community asks?

He is right about generosity.  Blue chips, not so much at this point for a risk versed investor.  Porn and VR ingratiation might be a good investment, but not much to invest in yet.  Doubt it will be Facebook with their new acquisition.
Anything related to fossil fuels is a better short term investment for a return in your life time.  Bitcoin, best bet for a bubble investment.  Reminds me of the 90s with the internet.  I see at least 3 more years of ipo type fun, but I am not an investment professional.

@_date: 2014-06-14 07:27:59
Their hash fluctuates, well most mining hash fluctuates.  This is why it is humorous to see people commenting on this issue that obviously have never mined using equipment that hashes at these levels.  They will be back up to 50%+ tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-06-14 04:18:42

@_date: 2014-06-15 07:58:03
Merge mining and alt-coin mining with zero fees would work.  
Can you afford a run a pool that can support 50+ petahash?
What are you plans if you exceed 40% of the network hash?
Honestly, miners can tolerate variance for the most part, but when you have thousands, if not millions invested in equipment, you really can not tolerate a risk towards reliably.

There is not much benefit right now.  Merchant adoption has increased, but most do not offer a discount for purchases using BTC.  You will also lose some consumer rights if using it as a currency.

2 -3 million for tape out, then fabrication for how ever many units to exceed current bitcoin hash rates.  It might cost what 10 - 20 million to exceed the current hash rate with 3rd gen asics?  Seems pretty cheap to topple an 8 billion market cap to promote your own digital currency.  
@_date: 2014-06-14 04:06:00
I have been mining for two years.  P2Pools will not resolve the issue.  The PoW issue will always exist until the developers decide to implement/supplement a better solution to PoW.
To add to this, asic systems are at the level now where you need data center hosting due to power requirements, 3k+ socket requirements. Spend some time researching the equipment on the market and look at the cost to deploy the equipment to support bitcoin before you arbitrarily ask us to switch pools.
It is only going to get more centralized until the incentive to own the most hash is resolved.

@_date: 2014-06-14 01:58:32
It still does not solve the problem that someone can buy 51% of the network hash rate in hardware, mine solo and cause network problems.  It is very affordable now with asics for some organizations or governments that have a vested interest in promoting their own digital currency to use these tactics.
Sorry, joining a P2Pool or sabotaging ghash does not resolve the underlining issue.  We really need to address the PoW issue in the protocol now rather than later.
@_date: 2014-06-14 00:54:08
This is really not a solution.  Today it is ghash and tomorrow it could be China, US, Google, Amazon or whoever.  Do you really think the issue is with ghash?

We focus like Netflix did.  They caught some flack the past couple of years with broadcasters and rate changes.  Now ABC, NBC, CBS as well as many other broadcasters and production companies come to them and ask if they would like to pick up the series when they get cancelled by "Hollywood" aka nielsen.  How does this relate to bitcoin? I am not sure, but we are on the cusp of something similar.
