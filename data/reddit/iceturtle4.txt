I think if this Tether thing becomes an issue, then yes.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:30:29
lol. OK.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:27:15
I'd look beyond what Coinbase sells at the time... lots of other promising coins out there.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:29:43
I think that's mis-information. I believe an increase in block size was always the plan... why that hasn't happened yet is beyond me. Maybe BCH is on to something.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:18:06


And that's for you! I'll assume you now discard your belief, yes? Or are you as dishonest with yourself as you are to others? Playa, please.
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:12:33
Lol. Yes! I see the light!

This always made me laugh: [

This is a good question. I have my credentials on paper that I've given to my fiance.
I've wondered this too... even a few coins 10 years from now could be money worth fighting for if you have a relative that had a coinbase account.
@_date: 2014-02-14 01:58:39
Awesome! Thank you!
@_date: 2014-03-21 19:45:13
is 10 considered a lot? I know it's all relative, but generally speaking? 
@_date: 2018-05-01 20:16:46
Short answer is yes. If you display an iPhone though, thats a different story.

What do most people consider a "Life changing value" in this thread? 5k? 10k? 100k? More?
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:42:09
Maybe the community has highs and lows... just like...

I run a small web design firm and we hold out bitcoins, because we believe there value to be more than money. Not an everyday purchase, but if you are interested, check us out!

never mind, I figured it out.

ooooops. Thank you!

Here we go as promised! (actually a day late, sorry)
A little disappointed that we only got about 450 responses when the last one had 3k. Kind of discouraging. But interesting info none the less, no real surprises to me, other than the pool of people claiming 50+ bitcoins... anyone else shocked by that? Am I just a poor peasant with a handful of coins?
Enjoy everyone! I'll give it another go in fall/winter.

Added. Good idea.
@_date: 2014-07-16 19:13:37
Not sure. I actually posted TWICE hoping to get more traction. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 21:01:42
I find that tech-lovers (those to get the gadgets first, are on all social networks, etc) know about it, but only know headlines. The news of gox, price boom, price fall etc. So they "know" about it, but don't KNOW what it really is. To them it's something to talk about, something to gossip about. No real "opinions" about it, because it has not proven itself very useful to them. It's a topic of conversation like the latest episode of some TV show.
To the tech people who write code, web, etc. I feel they understand it, and see what it CAN do, not what it IS doing.
Honestly I'm the only one I know with bitcoin, but I also consider myself the most tech-driven of anyone I know, but far from the top.
@_date: 2014-01-15 20:37:00
how can I make sure API is disabled?
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:00:38
I appreciate your thoughtfulness and concern. I've had moments of doubt too - not about bitcoin, but adoption. I still believe because I think the adoption will grow with those who want it to grow. Enough people want bitcoin to happen, enough smart people who create the code and internet and this digital space that so many use.
I've always found the internet to be a place that so many people use, but so few actually create. Those who create it are the true gatekeepers, and it's my opinion they/we want it to happen.
@_date: 2014-07-13 02:04:00
haha! I actually know one of these guys. We did improv together. I'll let him know! ;)
@_date: 2014-01-08 20:23:20
I'm sorry! I guess I could see how that could be risky... No up-votes anyway... just was curious as to the majority of reddit bitcoin users.

Thinking Monday. Give it the weekend.

You WERE using 2FA? Sorry, can you explain how that happened then? I'm not being a dick, I actually am wondering, isn't there a send 2FA as well?
@_date: 2016-11-08 08:22:01
Well, I don't think it will happen, but don't think it's impossible too.
@_date: 2018-06-06 05:21:46
Same. Would love it if someone could explain exactly how you go about attempts by to solve these. In an ELI5 sort of way... pretty please? ��
@_date: 2019-06-01 20:06:30
I thought it's just a store of value though? I thought we're not suppose to spend it on small purchases?
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:22:29
I experience it both places. The idea the proportions are way out of whack is not something I’m experiencing. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:47:12
The question really is - do we switch to Bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2019-02-12 21:40:29
How  much has he lost since then? Not being rude, but the timeline of your story suggests he might have.
@_date: 2019-06-22 19:06:04
Kraken and Coinbase are both great! I have and continue to use both with little to no issues.
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:30:40
Would it be a wash with the fees though? I keep seeing all the high fee discussion and how we're not supposed to use for everyday transactions. ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:51:50
It's not conspiracy, it's actually happening and I'm quite scared we'll see it take down bitcoin much like MtGox did. But this time it's at such a high point with so many regular people (vs just computer nerds back when it was MtGox) buying in, it will tarnish the entire crypto currency world. Many will lose thousands and the governments will step and declare how dangerous this all is and we might see the end.
I certainly hope not... but this tether thing is very real and unregulated.
@_date: 2019-02-20 18:57:45
Yes! I am part of r/btc and have been with bitcoin and r/Bitcoin since 2013. I have equal parts BTC and BCH. I think most that have been around as long or longer than I are all about cryptocurrency succeeding as a whole but have been discouraged by some of the censorship this sub had going on at one time. Right now it is IMO easier to use BCH as peer to peer money and that's what interests me. I don't hate on Bitcoin, I want it to work out too. Success for any coin is success for the ecosystem as a whole. I'm not sure why we can't all see that? Why fight each other? I'll happily post this video over there if you won't, I don't think there's any actually real active users over there that wouldn't at least inform themselves or give it a considerate watch.
@_date: 2019-06-22 17:24:20
That’s my thoughts too... just seems so odd!
@_date: 2019-06-29 17:52:45
Awesome! Has anyone paid yet? How are you handling the high fees?
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:57:11
GET OUT OF TETHER ASAP.
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:24:59
Love it! Rising tides lifts all boats!
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:00:31
I’m sorry that’s your experience with it! Mine is different but that doesn’t make yours wrong.
@_date: 2019-02-20 22:21:48
I think that happens on both sides honestly. I mean... even the title of this post is a bit antagonistic. Hopefully there's enough of us in each to keep level heads about it all and realize in the end we're all on the same team and that fiat is the true enemy I suppose.
@_date: 2019-02-21 00:42:57
I don’t know what else to tell you my man... maybe the universe will Freaky Friday us one day.
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:15:59
Oh shit. I didn't know it wasn't "barrels" either.
@_date: 2019-01-12 15:14:31
Been in bitcoin since 2012, no need to school me bro. Good luck, I want nothing but the best for all crypto, I’m just saying the attacks and name calling don’t help the cause. I’m sorry you feel the need to resort to that... for what? 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:39:32
I see a slow decline as people sell wanting to take profits... you figure a large portion of people bought in at 5k+, so as we inch closer to that, people will sell as to not want to take a loss.
Probably similar to 2014... we'll slowly creep down over the next few months... stabilize around 5k until another big event happens triggering a bull run... although this time with ETH and Bitcoin Cash... I'm not sure people will wait... they'll just move over to a coin with more promise and better results.
Overall nobody can be sure - but I know nobody is pouring new money in right now, and lack of LN makes it virtually useless...
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:06:24
Whoa. It's ok buddy. I just said to ask this question to a different crowd and see for their self. No need to get your tits in a twist.
@_date: 2019-01-12 16:28:58
Ah ya got me! I’ve been exposed!! Lol. At this point I just feel bad for you. ��‍♂️ 
@_date: 2019-01-12 14:46:57
@_date: 2018-02-10 01:24:16
Until the next bull run... then we’ll be right where we were in December and BCH will start looking good to some people.
@_date: 2018-03-22 02:51:26
I just sorta feel bad for you is all.

and here's a tip for you!
Next time instead of butter on your popcorn, try some coconut oil. OMG I tried this and it was amazing. Healthier (kind of) and something about it gives it an delicious, almost movie theater tasting quality about it!
@_date: 2019-05-16 04:12:50
I think increasing the block size figured that out.
@_date: 2018-12-11 17:16:16
Because all the buying that got us here were from people trying to get rich quick. Even my Mom was like "how do I get me some of that bitcoin?" for no other reason than she heard the value keeps going up. ALL of those people sold when it started to go down, and now here we are at a price before all the hype. Let's get some adoption, ease of use and more secure ways to hold your coins and then we might see the price go back up.
