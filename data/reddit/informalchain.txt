Sorry to hear. Ask your bank and coinsquare both to do a MT103 trace. It normally would take 5-7 business days. I have heard similar horror stories from someone I know that TD doing dodgy things holding funds that deal with crypto exchanges. Interestingly his funds appeared as soon as he formally requested the bank to do a trace.

G20 will be back in July to create FUD. SEC will continue it's tantrums in Summer. I expect fall onward this year for Bitcoin to rise and shine.

You wake up and tether is busted and made illegal to trade...how the hell then would you trade it for Bitcoin or alts? Exchanges will refuse to redeem or trade tether.

Hong Kong is a money laundering cesspool. China taking over may be bad for the independence of HK but it could stop dirty money flooding the west.

If tether is busted and made illegal then how would you trade for Bitcoin? Exchanges will not redeem or trade tether.

Didn't facebook do a similar thing while working on their own coin libra? Perhaps we should expect a google coin soon?

Global villains meeting to plot the hero's downfall. They want to set an example by making the hero a martyr. Though yet to be seen how successful they can be against the sheer raging math power of the hero. It all sounds like a sci-fi phenomenon happening realtime. Interesting times we live in.

Idiot tweet. The only argument left for Bitcoin is low supply and store of value nonsense. The real purpose (peer-to-peer currency) has been killed by lack of new devs and speculations. Now add futures market into this gong show and you have a pure speculative asset. Once a great idea has been morphed into a musical chairs Ponzi by greedy humans.

The reserves are only arbitrary based on expected future interest.

Bakkt will be making losses if they don't see enough trading interest. So they got to manipulate the market in some manner, and depending on which direction some of their major customers want to see bitcoin's price go next. One path for them is to sell their btc holdings to create a shorting interest to encourage big players trade in their platform. 
The risk for bakkt and their wall street customers is they can get burnt due to physical bitcoin settlement clause, since they now compete on a global asset that trades in many other unregulated exchanges.

The solution to all this pain is for the governments to accept Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies as currency and a form of legal tender. But they are adamant and refusing to accept this fact to scare, punish early adopters all to slow down mass adoption. Imo the market aka people decide what a currency is or not and it's value, not some beaurocrat or politician.

What can the exchanges do about this? Can they delist or something.
