These aren't the only operational security problems they're having...
Looks like they decided to censor this.   FTFY:

I'd hardly call identifying someone stealing from your customers only after a two week delay and a reddit post to get it done as "going so far out of my way".    It seems quite relevant that attacks on your site are broader than those described in this blog post.

Unleash the sock puppet army!     
Seriously though nothing in my comment was untrue.    And in a blog post  about bad operational security, it could not be more relevant.

We only used the site to test and understand some technical aspects of their implementation. We fully intended to abandon the account. They don't require you to set a password initially, we only set one after we had trouble and knew we may need to access the account for support purposes. The main issue here is they ignored 4 emails for over two weeks and only addressed this after we posted to reddit. It was a small amount of coins, we don't care about that aspect of it.
The reason this comment was posted here is that they seem to have a trend of failing to monitor their systems for malicious activity. We only used the site for a few minutes, so if coins were stolen they must have people doing constant brute force attacks against all users.

Yes, as indicated in the post you removed, I did use a very weak password, simply because I had not intended to use the account again.   In both cases (your blog post and the brute force attacks) you experience behavior which ought to be highly detectable (inordinate volume of bets / login attempts).    As a user of your service, I make no apology for not following reasonable security practices on my password.  As the site operator, you do have the obligation to run a secure site, if you want it to have a good reputation.   Further,  my complaint is largely about your "customer service".   I had asked that you comment on that post to help clear the air, instead you deleted it.   You seem not to fully appreciate the relationship between your lax attitudes on these points and likely your lack of "coding ability" and the resulting failures of the site.

Your blog post and reddit promotion are not intended as underhanded marketing efforts?
And by hours looking into it, you mean your developer's hours right?    Sorry it was such a bother for you to run your site...

This is certainly one advantage of an on-chain game.   Not feasible to filter bitcoin transactions by location.

If you're looking for an honest game, we've been offering a fair and provable on-chain dice since April 2013.    
We also agree with what redditchampsys says.   Once you find a trustworthy place to play, play responsibly.  You should always treat games of chance as a GAME.

Good job being on top of that, chief.   World saved.

It would have just been an empty post had nobody commented.   I really was just checking why my other, more informative and on-topic post had not shown because I was banned or if it was just that post. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:25:56
Banned or not.    You never know with this sub.
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:28:44
apparently not banned, just my completely politically agnostic comment to help a user understand facts was....
@_date: 2017-03-13 09:34:57
I expect it will never hit the front page.   It would not be necessary if it were not for overzealous moderation policy.

To be fair they're stored in an encrypted wallet file.   So if you've used a password with sufficient entropy it should be relatively secure, so long as your browser / computer are not compromised.
The wallet related issues that have been experienced with bc.i have been mostly related to broken random number generators on the host device.   
Of course an unreliable blockchain is not a very good basis to operate your wallet from, so there are plenty of reasons that it is reasonable to consider using other wallets.

So long as the rules miners apply to deciding which transactions are allowed into their mempool are known, it is fairly straight forward to know which transactions have a high enough likelihood of being mined to build a business with the acceptable loss of accepting unconfirmed transactions.
Making it easier to double spend a transaction solves which problem exactly?    RBF-FSS makes sense, there are good reason to want to add fees to existing transactions, and even add additional outputs.   But we should not be encouraging people to send transactions that they then can trivially reverse.   There is no good reason for this.
We've seen the argument that this is just making clear what is already the case (that zero conf tx are insecure).   But its also already the case that if you send a transaction it could be mined seconds later.   So, there's no guarantee that your doublespend button on your wallet is going to work, either.   All it does is muddy the water and make it far less likely to know which transactions are going to get mined. 
@_date: 2015-07-20 10:17:24
    We have been following this thread and similar ones trying to understand where the "0-conf is doomed so let's go ahead and implement RBF" mindset is coming from.   Your response here makes clear the source of the misinformation.  Thank you for commenting frankly on this topic.
Consider all the other things you hear in the media, and how often sensationalized they are.   When you hear about someone being double spent, you're not hearing about the thousands of unsuccessful attempts.   It would appear that your opinion is shaped by a selection bias skewed toward a belief that the small number of successful attempts represent a (much) larger quantity than they actually do.    Consider it this way, if you knew nothing of Bitcoin, and you heard about some Bitcoin hacks....you may very well conclude that Bitcoin is insecure (as many in the general public have).    
The actual truth is, so long as the Bitcoin network operates as Satoshi designed it, with a majority of honest participants, with the presumption that those participants resist efforts to double spend legitimate transactions (whether confirmed or not), it is very possible to operate a business model which can tolerate a small amount of double spending.

It makes sense to require a minimum fee ratio when accepting unconfirmed transactions.   Sites like ours for example do require min fee as well as significant network propagation in order to be processed unconfirmed.   You're right to be critical of someone associating fee and confirmation count.   Confirmation count and total transaction value maybe. 
@_date: 2015-02-16 07:05:18
We won't disagree that we (SatoshiBones) copied S'dice's business model when we launched in April 2013, but emulating an idea vs. a direct rip-off of design, art, and text is not just in poor taste, it's an infringement of IP which will not go unchallenged.   At least put a LITTLE bit of effort into making your site unique!
@_date: 2015-02-16 06:49:22
I have every confidence that a site willing to rip off design, artwork, copy, and code verbatim will follow only the highest ethical framework in it's dealings with customers!
