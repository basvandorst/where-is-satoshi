Do you think that the transaction fee is too low for it to be confirmed?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:23:41
Transaction A
transaction B
Transaction B last character might not be right, i need to speak with the sender to show me the transaction ID again.  the picture he showed me is a bit cut off
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:12:11
ok thanks,
so I guess coinbase will have the answer to the second transaction of BTC 0.1?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:14:09
Yo here’s is the second transaction ID 
But it’s not showing in blockchain
It’s been three days now 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:49:20
i bought another 0.1 from the same sender
so does that mean the 2nd transaction the this address: 1JwdozLPVQC7cpteCo9RWj7dhbcKXWB2rZ 
could still be pending?
and this 1HMaZjoJ9dJJNxEPjLTBfSpik4TrpqufQc is different?
if it is, why is 1HMaZjoJ9dJJNxEPjLTBfSpik4TrpqufQc  in the same transaction ID as my address?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:06:07
But in the transaction
The sender did send it to the same first address That was spent
And he tried to send the second transaction to the same first address but now it created a second address which is the change address
And now this second address is formed and unspent 
Is there a way to get it back to the sender or it’s losy in that new address
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:56:51
But the sender sent it to the same address
So who own owns that address?  I paid for that bitcoin 
So it’s gone forever?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:11:54
Yes I can provide both...
@_date: 2017-12-05 11:01:52
I FaceTime him so it was live.  I did see him send it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:46:56
Bare in mind the senders btc wallet is 30 weeks behind.  Could that affect the transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:04:04
ok will do,
So basically, the 2nd transaction could be in limbo somewhere.
but this unspent address:
1HMaZjoJ9dJJNxEPjLTBfSpik4TrpqufQc 
has nothing to do with me then?
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:24:13
sorry im new to reddit but thanks for the link
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:14:03
Sure bare with me
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:42:00
he took the picture of both transaction.  he was using bitcoin - wallet.
it did say both transaction was sent to this address
1JwdozLPVQC7cpteCo9RWj7dhbcKXWB2rZ 
i saw him do it live when i facetime him.  he did send it to me.
im new to all of this.
im using coinbase and when i received my first bitcoin.  it only showed 1 transaction, and when he sent another, it showed 2.  but the second one is that new address.
im absolutely confused with all of this.  i actually thought sending two separate transaction to the same address would work.  i didnt know it would create another address within the same address 
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:31:31
how can i send the pictures to you on reddit?
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:50:13
So how can I retrieve it?
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:02:35
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:10:07
My question now is
If a sender sends a transaction to A address 
And the sends another to A address
Could you receiver bitcoin in the same address in two different transaction?
@_date: 2017-12-03 06:57:25
i did not make this transaction
