I'm not sure the Libertarian philosophy would work for all of America though.  Yes, there are small communities that they would do wonders for to get their business off the ground, but I think some places (like Massachussetts due to our roads nearly constantly needing to be fixed due to snow) where the libertarian ideology doesn't work.

A lot of people do, but a lot of people in those parties also dislike Trump and Clinton.  I'd say it's around 50% of the voting population that dislikes them with around 25% actually liking each of them.  
The 50% that dislike them is a bigger voting block, but they need to be unified which is difficult.  Either the Libertarians or the Greens need to find a common ground between pissed off conservatives and pissed off liberals to pull this off.  
IF (big if) they succeed in uniting the 50% of the population that dislike Trump and Hillary they will crush them easily.

What if nobody votes for the republicans or Democrats and we vote green and Libertarian?

I agree with you, but there's actually a chance this election.  remember, only 25% of the voting population support Clinton and Trump.  The other 50% dislike them.  If the Libertarians can united pissed off Librals and pissed off Republicans they can win.  
However, the rules state that if no majority is reached they the house decides between the top 3 candidates.  Therefore, with the current house, the republicans will give it to Trump unless the greens out preform him.  In that case they'd likely give it to the libertarians.

I've heard bad things about the Koch's.  I don't think they'd want no government, I think they'd want government to help only them.
