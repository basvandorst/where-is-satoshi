Why don't you buy a hardware wallet, it's much better than using a online wallet with multisig. Anyways I believe you are looking for something like this.
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:21:26
How we are supposed to know, we don't run redditand there are over 8000 users here.
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:59:18
Use wallets that allow you to set custom fees. Such as Electrum
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:47:12
For example check this transaction. It's 6124 (bytes) 2777ed2410b09bc408ffe70ffa3de872debd922a4b66270b979fa1df9c664b9f

@_date: 2017-09-01 09:29:10
We will redesign our site once people start using it, and  I don't believe design doesn't affects our services. We not tracking anything nor asking any data for free transactions from users. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:28:38
0.00006BTC or  (5-10 satoshi per byte) is normal, but right now it's like 200 satoshi for higher priority. You can check fees here bitaps.com or 
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:43:04
You can try localbitcoins.com and find a local seller who can sell for cash. Please make sure to do deal with high feedback users only.
@_date: 2017-09-01 08:42:00
It's free for less than 500 byte transactions. We want to avoid large size/dust transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:12:49
No we are not.
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:13:42
Sorry sir but you are wrong, please feel free to try our site first.
@_date: 2017-09-01 15:21:03
Yes Lightning is awesome :)
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:09:41
Sorry but there's no other way, you have to send bitcoins from your electrum wallet to trezor wallet. However you can choose to pay lowest fees and use a transaction accelerator service like ours for speedy transfer.
@_date: 2017-10-14 00:01:06
Im sorry for your loss brother but thats something we cannot help with.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:51:47
What do you mean?
@_date: 2017-10-05 19:02:20
Let's see buddy.
@_date: 2017-10-13 22:06:18
Sorry someone else was on support. We are not going to implement ads.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:49:16
Its $4, we don't have ads to be clicked at this time
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:23:46
We removed it because we didn't wanted to post multiple thread on reddit and we recently made our site free. It was fully paid service before.
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:54:57
I don't think it was done by attacker, it might be those people sending transactions who don't have any technical knowledge about bitcoins. We received over 250 request in past 24 hours on  and all had low transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:03:25
Thank you
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:27:00
send 2 tx of the same size to different addys
put 1 in the accelerator and 1 not
you'll be amazed
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:23:52
Use our site,  thousands of users are using it daily.

@_date: 2017-09-01 10:18:37
Someone who have submitted 0BTC Fees tx, I would to inform you that it might take few hours but your tx will confirm.
@_date: 2017-09-01 12:06:49
Thank you and Not sure what you meant by pepes but if you have large tx, please pm us, we will accelerate it for free.
@_date: 2017-10-28 16:00:12


Thats what everyone said 10 hours ago as well lmao
@_date: 2017-09-01 16:55:34
Sorry but you can't override that once coins are sent, If you have any pending transaction, you can use confirmtx.com
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:20:10
You could have saved fees and used confirmtx.com
@_date: 2017-09-02 14:28:39
Seed does not contains any imported address. Don't you remember if you have imported any address in electrum? You must be using some wallet before that.
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:16:49
It was posted 6 days ago, We registered here 1 day ago
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:53:01
Then you should try to download the old electrum client. All previous versions are available here 
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:26:15
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:27:13

2e1fca53148718bd4d00eeebed510a9417a96a5bbd09be395c51afe776954ef2 It is confirmed now
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:21:43
It's high because there are over 70thousand unconfirmed transactions. if you want to skip the que you either have to use a transaction accelerator(confirmtx.com or viabtc.com ) or you can pay higher fees to get your transaction included in next 2-3 blocks.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:39:25
I just checked coinspace wallet, it doesn't have manual fees option and looks Bad. I think you should use either basic Bitcoin wallet on Android or mycellium wallet. As for address change, yes it's normal and meant to keep your transaction little private by generating a new addresses.
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:50:35
I've never seen a blockmining taking this long. It's around 89 minutes since last block.
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:44:49
@_date: 2017-10-05 18:55:18
That's 3 years ago, I assume this happened after a long time.
@_date: 2017-09-01 10:45:35
For large size transactions only. Such as 2000byte tx. Btc.com charges around 30$ for acceleration while we will do that in just 4$.
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:59:18
I stated there were 85k unconfirmed transactions, was i wrong?
Our site never asks for a private key, just a transaction hash so where did you even get a private key concept from?
If your tx is over 500 bytes we ask for $4, nothing more or less. 
Yes my account is 6 weeks old and we are ranked first page on google, go ahead an search for bitcoin accelerator. 
It's not a scam, if any person is visiting an accelerator site and entering their private keys that is pure ignorance. We aren't here to rob anyone blind, thats why our service is a low price of $4 REGARDLESS of the tx fee. Meanwhile "trusted" competitors are charging 10x+ that amount. 
Don't try to spread fud about my service, please don't use my service if you doubt it. Your beware post is nothing but bullshit. I didn't work hard on this project for people to post "beware". Show me some respect and quit being over dramatic. I am apart of the community as are you.
@_date: 2017-10-13 18:49:36
He's a hater/troll.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:23:00
Not normal, there are over 70 thousand unconfirmed transactions so transaction fees is higher right now to get confirmations faster. You can always pay low fees and use a free Bitcoin transaction accelerator.
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:15:02
I know nothing about it, contact their support.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:08:28
This is correct, most people do same mistake. Please note this: If you are trying to accelerate your transaction please make sure there's no other unconfirmed transaction in your wallet or your transaction is not from some site which keeps sending unconfirmed payments. These kinds of transaction can not be accelerated.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:17:15
Trezor is best and it's best to calculate fees manually via bitaps.com or bitcoinfees21.co
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:10:18
If it's in que you just need to wait. Your transaction is confirmed now.
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:52:49
We don't run coinhive, we did at one point but it reduced my user base by 1/2
@_date: 2017-09-01 11:19:04
Please check whatever you want, we are providing a free service,there's nothing that's weird or shady in it. Please try our site and viabtc at the same time with 2 different tx's and check which one gets confirmed faster.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:05:41
Your transaction was confirmed. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:46:51
If you saved the passphrase you can use it to generate a new wallet in mycellium,no transfer is required and yes you can set tx priority in mycellium.
@_date: 2017-10-13 23:59:55
How did it work out?
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:44:45
Nope, pushtx.btc.com's transactions are confirmed by BTC.com pool and confirmtx.com's transctions are confirmed by antpool. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 21:44:43
Its free but suit yourself
@_date: 2017-09-02 15:54:36
Are you using same pc? If yes check C:\Users\*YourUsername*\AppData\Roaming\Bitcoin and see if you are able to find any wallet.dat file.
@_date: 2017-10-14 01:27:35
Ah okay but thats not malicious, not sure why thats happening either tbh.
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:23:41

@_date: 2017-10-16 21:28:27
Thank you for the constructive criticism, its all I ask opposed to just BEWARE.
