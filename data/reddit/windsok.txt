I believe it's the same argument James Hilliard made on the dev list:
"2. BIP70 requires large complex PKI dependencies such as X.509 and TLS
support(usually via openssl) which have a large attack surface and
poor track record when it comes to vulnerabilities."

Any BTC market is also a Satoshi market, they are just different unit denominations.
@_date: 2018-01-03 07:45:42
I think the question is why does it require access to the JSON-RPC interface? Why can't it just use the normal Peer-to-Peer connection to the trusted node? (eg. this is how it seems to work in breadwallet, you give it the IP address of the trusted node, and it connects to that node, and requests headers, relays transactions, etc through the normal P2P layer via a connection to only that node)
Samurai must be doing something extra or special that needs JSON-RPC access, or maybe JSON-RPC adds some extra privacy?

Background / Context: 


But Bitcoin was not broken that day. A grueling struggle ensued, and over the course of several hours, the entire BearWhale ask wall was demolished, satoshi by satoshi. The vigilant light of a future without fiat inspired the bull soldiers to conquer this foe, or die trying.
By the early morning, Eastern Standard Time, the BearWhale had been defeated; his ask wall consumed. In its wake, the bodies of fallen comrades littered the landscape, speculation on the source and purpose of BearWhale consumed the narrative, and exchange owners around the world went out for champagne after collecting 0.2% of the bloodshed.
To commemorate this exalted day, ShapeShift.io commissioned two leading community artists to render their impression of The Slaying of BearWhale.

They have moved enough hashrate into BCH to overtake BTC in the number of blocks generated before the next BCH difficulty adjustment.

Basically your node is configured to fail a payment if the routing fees are more than 0.5% of the payment.
Couple of solutions:
1) paint  more pixels so your payment is larger, and the fees will drop below 0.5%
2) open another channel that will charge less routing fees. Eg. a channel directly with satoshis.place, or another well connected node (I recommend rompert.com)
3) change the config of your node to allow a higher fee %

Could you elaborate more on how that would work? thanks!
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:32:00
Correct, Bitfinex was the first exchange to use both the BCH ticker and the BCash name.
It's all outlined in this blog post - 
In summary, BCash was originally pushing the use of the BCC ticker symbol. However, Bitfinex had already used BCC for their Bitcoin Core chain split tokens for their Bitcoin Unlimited chain split markets, so they were unable to use BCC. Additionally, Bitfinex felt that the name 'Bitcoin Cash' would lead to confusion of users, so they chose to name the coin 'Bcash' on their platform.
It does go to show the power and dominance of Bitfinex, that the entire ecosystem has also moved to listing Bcash as BCH. Bitfinex chain split markets for Segwit2x were also instrumental in showing the lack of market support for B2X. Makes you wonder about all the recent Bitfinex FUD, and who would have an incentive to attack Bitfinex...

Time value of money. If you have BT1 then you can't actually do anything with those funds other than to wait for the exchange to convert it to BTC.

Interesting stuff, thanks for your work.
I'm curious how dropzone queries and post transactions to the blockchain. It looks like it can be used without needing a local full node.
eg. I just installed it and could run this straight away:
    $ dropzone profile seller show 17Q4MX2hmktmpuUKHFuoRmS5MfB5XPbhod

Yes, each card is registered as an asset on the bitcoin blockchain via the counterparty protocol. The number issued varies per card. For example, there are only 3 JONGPEPE in existence.

Create a wallet on rarepepewallet.com and flip over each card to see the buy/sell orders.
Another way would be via sites like xcpdex.com, eg. here is the market for RAREPEPE/PEPECASH - 
@_date: 2017-04-09 12:06:26
@_date: 2017-04-09 10:04:17
The value is purely based on supply and demand. rarepepewallet.com  allows you to trade cards on the Counterparty Decentralized Exchange  (DEX) for either PEPECASH or XCP, though most trades these days are done in PEPECASH.
The DEX is like a normal exchange with buy and sell orders, except it is completely decentralized, and runs on top of the bitcoin blockchain.
You could also use counterwallet.io to access the exchange.

All the way back in 2011, the original creator of collected donations with the intention of spending them on Reddit ads promoting However, the rate of donations and BTC price increases outpaced the rate of spending, so the ad fund ended up with an unexpected surplus which has to this day not been fully exhausted.
So far, the ad fund has been used to pay for:
* Some Reddit ads. (1.878 BTC)
* Sponsorship of an esport tournament. (1 BTC)
* Sponsorship of Axiom esports. (7.47999117 BTC)
The total amount collected and spent is always listed at the bottom of the sidebar. Additional donations are no longer accepted.
moderators do not have time to figure out good ways of spending this money, and we don't want to just blow it on some mostly-useless AdSense or whatever. So we leave it to the users of to figure out how to spend the money effectively. The process is:
1. Come up with an idea and create a detailed plan. You'll have to do all of the work on executing the idea. Since it's the *ad fund*, your idea must have something to do with *advertising* Bitcoin and/or 2. Make a post to with your plan. If it receives fairly widespread support, you can move forward.
3. Send mail to modmail stating a budget and a time limit. If theymos approves your plan, you will be reimbursed from the ad fund up to the amount specified in your budget after your idea is complete, assuming this occurs within the time limit.

This is pretty much consistent with the statement put out by most major exchanges when it looked like a Bitcoin Unlimited hard fork might activate - 
I expect that these exchanges will also follow those guidelines for the 2x fork. However, one key point of those guidelines is that they will not support any contentious fork that does not have strong 2-way replay protection.
