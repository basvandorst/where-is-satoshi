It's one of those things that I'm sure anyone could google and find an abundance of forum posts or conspiracy sites claiming to have a system.
I was just curious to hear if this user had seen any correlation.

I wasn't claiming there's psychic merit to trading on astrology. Just consider though, maybe the whales in the more superstitious countries are basing their moves on astrology.

Thought this was a joke, but googled and there actually is an astrological event for anyone wondering.
How do you think it will impact the price? I'm genuinely curious if you have you noticed correlation in the past?
I've heard of stock traders looking at astrology for market predictions, as fringe as it sounds. It's possibly a self-fulfilling thing, with whales in the more superstitious countries basing their moves on astrology too.

I wasn't expecting such an-depth reply! Still an interesting thing to consider nonetheless, thanks!

Did you manage to figure it out?
[I made this album]( of all the hidden stuff I found, but I've given up figuring out the cipher.

It does look nice, but I can see it looking dated quickly. 
Think about how money would look if it was redesigned in the 90s, hyper colours and gradients everywhere. Whereas the current design is kinda timeless.

Haha, I thought I was taking a risk buying 1btc :)
