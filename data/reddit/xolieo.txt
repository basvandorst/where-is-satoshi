Now that the DDOS method has been published, it will probably get worse until the method of exploit is patched. It will last as long as the attacker(s) wants it to. Which is most likely as long as it is effective in lowering the price of bitcoin.

Honestly, as a seller, accepting bitcoin through a service like Coinbase or BitPay has no downside. You can accept the payment as 100% fiat. Ontop of that they pay a lower transaction fee than if they had used Paypal or a major credit card company for the transaction. 
Transaction processors like Coinbase and BitPay take all the risk.

Without a time machine, nobody can say for sure. Because the price is purely based on speculation this is a high risk/ high reward investment. Not something I would put a high % of my savings into if I was close to retirement.
**Previous performance is not an indication of the future.** That's not to say that this is the end of the rise of Bitcoin. If you are going to invest, do it because you want to. Do it because you accept the risk. Do it for whatever reason you want. Just don't do it because it did extremely well in the past.

Paper wallets with tamper evident seals are perhaps the best way to store coins physically. Tamper evident seals keep the private key hidden until you break the seal. If someone accesses your wallet without your knowledge, you will know due to the seal being broken up.

First, the address is useless. Addresses point to a wallet, most of the time a temporary link. They are not the wallet themselves
Second, your key will open your wallet. Without your wallet, which i assume has been deleted, you are SOL.

The going price on a 7GHs miner is between $500-$600 so let's assume you just purchased it at $500 and started mining right this second and never stopped. 
According to [this]( you would see $601 after selling the coin you acquired from mining at $2k USD/BTC. A whopping $101 profit.
If you had put that money into buying a single bitcoin at $600 you would see a $1,400 profit. 
See where I'm going with this?
Mining could become profitable with a monster price increase, buy buying coin and holding will always be more profitable.
