Is which country this incident took place?

Crypto is NOT for that *average people*.


That *someone* is blessed with slavery for his/her lifetime.

Is that new?
@_date: 2018-05-12 17:19:33
Bitcoin is the new asset class.
@_date: 2014-11-06 20:35:32
It is very new. But +ve feedback are coming from the market.

Which is the best alternative right now?
1. Bisq.network - If u accept stolen FIAT, u r fucked. No way to trace back the sender.
2. Paxful.com - Mobile no. authentication is mandatory and based in US.
3. HodlHodl.com - Low volume. Hard to find a buyer/seller at an acceptable price.
4. Remitano.com - Multiple scam accusations against them, e.g. locking out fund and asking for ID verification. Appears to be Chinese, though incorporated in Seychelles.

The only rational explanation is either chain-bet is mining its own Tx or paying a miner to do the same.

That is not how it works at enterprise scale. You need to automate a lot of things, from payment to taxation.
