Of course anyone can. You just need a brokerage account that operated on Euronext

Good practice would be to add a source to the graph though. Otherwise people will indeed go off the name of the person that posted it
EDIT: downvoting common sense, you people are unbelievable

You started off with saying that because Libra isnt on track of succeeding Bitcoin has zero chance. 
Are current UX and technological hurdles limiting adoption at the moment? Of course, but even despite those hurdles, quite some people are already buying into the sector.
Price swings are mainly due to it being a totally new asset class, the market is still deciding what the network is really worth. Markets tend do do that... when it becomes more clear where its heading, price will inevitably stabilize.
I dont see europe or USA rushing towards banning bitcoin. So far only fascist regimes that are afraid of losing control on their people have been banning or trying to ban bitcoin.. So i dont think its that disruptive to the status quo, only when you have shit policies surpressing your population or have no clue about monetary policy and causing your currency to hyperinflate

A decentralized currency will get much more leniency compared to a private company that could ultimately get leverage on sovereign countries. Its comparing apples to oranges.
Europe doesnt trust facebook for one bit and have been challenging them with everything they do. We have way more stringent privacy laws like for example GDPR. Anything coming from Fb will be challenged. This issue is unrelated to bitcoins situation.. 
Europe and US have been increasingly more positive towards the industry as a whole, contrary to the Libra project.
Market manipulation can be reduced significantly by maturing as well. As liquidity increases, manipulation becomes more difficult

Given the technical difficulties the industry is still facing, plenty of people are already buying into it.
Currently there are still some obvious hurdles:
- industry as a whole is lacking maturity
- there are still some legal hurdles which have been impacting development &amp; adoption. 
- countries that could really make use of it, have banned it because they’re afraid people will want to secure some sovereinty over their money.
- UX issues (part of lacking maturity as a technology but worth to be mentioned on its own)

Because no middle man having any control over the ledger or a company known for breaching its customers privacy having control over the ledger are exactly the same?

Its the same with most banks lately in Europe, tighter controls on KYC &amp;AML
