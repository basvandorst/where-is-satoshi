Why do we simply not let transaction fees solve the problem?

Is that phone actually producing about double what I you get out of a normal 6950?

It only looks like a lot because the pins have a diameter of 1000km. I'm not even joking.

Jag menar det. Med ett enskilt bolag står du personligen ansvarig om allt går åt pipsvängen. Hoppas allt går väl, om du fortfarande är kvar om någon månad kommer jag troligtvis föra ut några rundor från min Miner genom dig.

A password hash should take as long time as possible to compute. The longer it takes the harder a brute-force attack on the database will be if someone gains access to it. If the computation takes long enough the attacker may deem it not even worth trying.

Could we please stop littering comments saying "+1" around us? It's not contributing anything to the technical discussion and in most cases has the opposite of the intended effect.

Socialist as in social security and social welfare, not the economical system.

Om du känner för att göra en post i [så har även där min uppröst. Men kom ihåg att den tvåprocentiga delen av varje transaktion du gör kan verka väldigt avskräckande för gemene man. Så det kanske passar med någon slags promotion i samband med posten, vad vet jag.

Ah, I see!
Helt orelaterad fråga: Driver du Kapiton som ett enskilt bolag, handelsbolag eller aktiebolag?
@_date: 2012-10-25 19:54:58
Oh, a private tracker and pyramid scheme at the same time!
@_date: 2012-06-27 06:39:30
So we meet again, guy who made my wallpaper.
@_date: 2012-04-20 16:40:03
Så hur går jag till väga för att överföra SEK från mitt Kaption-konto till en vanlig svensk bank?
@_date: 2012-06-08 07:04:41
That someone is most likely someone who runs a market or mining guild.
@_date: 2012-09-08 18:48:09
So you're thinking welfare trough donations?
@_date: 2012-10-25 21:01:01


And it charges users for downloads. Doesn't that mean that you'll have to register to the tracker?
@_date: 2012-09-17 11:03:45
So this was some anarchist propaganda fallowed by a commercial for what seemed like a scam?

I have wanted to ask this or a while now. All my bank accounts are in Swedish currency, located in Sweden. If I would like to transfer money into a Mt. Gox wallet, how would I go about it and which fees would I pay to whom?
@_date: 2011-10-23 01:39:17
Well he has a point which is: If it becomes impossible to trade state currencies with Bitcoins then it's soon to vanish.
@_date: 2011-10-23 02:41:03
Well didn't Mt.Gox just shut down their Euro transfers? And how do you know that it's far off? Once BitCoins gets some sort of presence it will happen.
@_date: 2011-09-02 14:18:04
How come an International Wire is cheaper than a Euro Bank Transfer?
@_date: 2011-09-02 16:46:01
So when your SEPA transfers come back online; Is it going to be cheaper to do a SEPA transfer than an international wire?
@_date: 2011-10-08 17:16:39
So what are namecoins and why do they exist?
@_date: 2011-12-16 16:05:11
By the way, is there any reason why you would like to have a transaction fee on your transaction? Does it make it more secure in any way?
@_date: 2013-08-04 21:05:18
Well wasn't there this British collage guy who got extradited to the US for hosting a site with links to video streams? Something which wasn't illegal in the UK.

They do it because the more people using TOR the safer it gets. But on the other hand it makes these exploits possible.

I find the term Neoclassical hard to comprehend...

You can open up a bug in launchpad and then wait. But I wouldn't invest too much hope in it. They have had completely broken applications in their repositories over multiple versions of Ubuntu. If I recall correctly it was either kdenlive or rosegarden that was just plain broken, did not even start. Above that even paying customers get abysmal support from Canonical so I the answer is probably no.

The thing is that there is no way to know if Windows has a backdoor so one shouldn't trust it, especially since we know fully well that other Microsoft products like Skype and Outlook do have them. Microsoft denies the allegations that Windows has one but since the code isn't available we can't demonstrate that there isn't.
So yeah, you are pretty well of just using the TOR browser. But you can also end up with your encrypted emails sent over TOR in the next days news paper like a political activist in Bangladesh.
@_date: 2013-01-29 22:21:03
They won't since they by all chances don't have any. 
@_date: 2013-06-26 23:50:42
Well there are banks that don't have any human contact with it's customers so I can definitely say that the statement is true: There are banks in Sweden that don't handle cash.
@_date: 2013-01-29 21:25:27
You are gaining ill will which is a real thing.
