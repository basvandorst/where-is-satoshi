i think that people should start looking at the BLOCKCHAIN as a technique that changes their lives for the better in terms of safety, speed of treatment and many other aspects.
the problem is that the bubble is rooted in their minds. and there is a saying that every vessel empties what is in it which means that the bubble speaks only about itself

Blockchain for education may be a new concept, but technologists already see a myriad of possibilities. Still, there are others who find more question than answers – and understandably so. Much of what we know about blockchain today is based on our knowledge of or experience with Bitcoin. And given regulatory barriers and the bureaucratic intricacies of most school systems, it’s hard to predict whether educational institutions will adopt the technology.
But you have to remember that most of the groundbreaking concepts we enjoy today—the internet, outsourcing, telecommuting, online payment processing, and even e Learning—were met with the same initial trepidation. So, while the future of blockchain in education is hard to say with pinpoint accuracy, from this vantage point, it definitely looks exciting.
