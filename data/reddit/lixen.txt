Many of the major Core contributors have voiced the opinion that they were unlikely to contribute to Bitcoin if their plan for it didn't go as they wished.
So I don't see much difference there, and it's perfectly reasonable to feel the same way about any other dev making such statements (through actions or through words).
(I don't necessarily agree with the notion that such people "can't be trusted", however. It's also perfectly reasonable that if the path
that is actually taken is too different from your vision of what it should be, that you would lose interest in pursuing it further. That shouldn't imply a violation of trust.)


Can you elaborate, and show me what substantiates it?
I'd also like to hear more about how it would work.
I think in the first place, implementations that accept any blocksize are probably intended as a blanket vote for any blocksize increase. The goal is probably not in the first place to become a new reference client. The reasoning being that if a node switches to such implementation, that he doesn't have to worry about any possible blocksize changing hardforks in the future.
But don't quote me on that, I'm just guessing.

Finally you pose some actual arguments in favor of RBF (I never said there are none).
My corrections of your misinformation were just to show less critical readers that RBF in no way allows for safer 0-conf transactions, as you were implying with your "merchant can request higher fee" line of reasoning.
Additionally, as "trivial" as people seem to call double spending current 0-conf transactions, RBF will make it *even more* trivial with guaranteed success.
Currently, people will apparently not go through the effort of ripping off merchants at PoS when they need to find ways to send their double spending transactions to specific miners (and hope they mine them), with an uncertain success chance.
With RBF, everyone will basically have the functionality built-in in his wallet with 100% success.
Advocate all you want for the up-sides of RBF, but don't sell it as something it is not, and don't misinform people that current 0-conf tx is as easy to double spent as RBF would-be.
@_date: 2015-12-31 11:14:05


Hand-waving on your side. Always a strong argument.


It is very relevant when discussing orphan rate. Your orphan rate is determined by how long it takes your block to propagate etc, which is unrelated to the size of the blocks of other miners.


So where the issue then? If fees made up for it, then it seems miners have no issue with the increases in the past and it didn't cause centralization pressure (as explained above, small miners could still mine small blocks to keep their orphan rate in check, *if this was actually relevant*).


Centralization solves a lot of issues for miners. I contest that a minor blocksize difference is responsible for this centralization, or in other words: these centralizing changes are beneficial to miners no matter the blocksize.
In addition to leveling the playing field with improvements we can come up with, we also need to grow the userbase and the number of miners to increase decentralization. Keeping an artificial restriction, not based on technical limits, will not make miners give up centralization improvements they can make.
@_date: 2015-12-31 09:17:23
You're mostly discussing semantics and I think you're missing the point.


No one is arguing to remove the distinction between these two. The argument is to not push Bitcoin towards either. Bitcoin shouldn't be used exclusively as a settlement for a layer 2 application. Neither should Bitcoin exclusively be used as a layer 1 application without extending it with layer 2 applications.
Bitcoin should stay neutral to how people use it and should not favor one above the other. There is no dichotomy in how it can be used (even if a lot of people try to make it seem that way).
@_date: 2015-12-21 10:53:46


Again, that's a non argument, considering the thief already received the goods at the moment he issues the RBF tx. He loses nothing in trying to recover as much as possible from the transaction.


These other offsets are applicable to the current transactions as well. Reality remains that RBF would introduce additional risk compared to the current 0-conf transactions.


Then please stick to highlighting the benefits, instead of adding misinformation to the discussion about the downsides.

I believe a 2mb cap would likely still be insufficient to handle transaction spikes during increased activity periods. That's only a factor 2 larger than the current cap, which we are hitting already quite often.
Having an 8mb cap in a period we don't need it won't do any harm (blocks will simply be smaller than the cap).
On the other hand, having a cap of 2mb (which is probably sufficient most of the time), and then seeing a spike in transactions (such as during the last run up in price) can be detrimental to the public opinion due to bitcoin not behaving the way users expect (e.g. "I paid the standard fee and my tx didn't make it into a block for 2 hours").

Stop spouting this nonsense. A would-be thief can issue a RBF transaction with a fee worth 50% of the actual transaction, he doesn't stand to lose anything as he already received the goods.
This is no protection against theft.
Additionally, the child transaction can just as well be used without the RBF, so it's in no way an argument for RBF.

Transactions are made to addresses, not to public keys. So the public key doesn't need to be known to make a valid transaction.
An address is derived from a public key, or from a script (which can contain public keys).
Edit: for clarification, I'm talking about the public keys of a receiving address not needing to be known by the network. Obviously, a sending address will expose its public keys.

Hold on here, I'm not arguing against a change. I'm all for increasing the cap. All I'm saying is I'm more in favor of a permanent solution now rather than quickly settling on the 20MB cap.
Why not combine the dynamic cap (in stead of a hard cap) and combine this with a dynamic max block size based on the size of previous blocks. Then we won't have to worry or even think about 'what if' in 10 years time.

This is demonstrably false.
The pool with the highest hashrate now has about 24%.

Lets suppose your numbers are correct (you should really provide sources if you want to throw around numbers): is this such a big surprise, considering most people use SPV wallets now, whereas practically everyone used the default client (i.e. a node) before.

@_date: 2015-06-02 08:30:01
It *is* artificial scarcity if you keep the max block size down for no other reason than making it scarce.
Ideally, the max block size should be about two times higher than the average amount of data needed per block (e.g. if average block is 500kB, then the max block size should be around 1MB). Then there is practically no scarcity (abundant block space) and the network is still protected from spam (a spammer can at most double the growth rate of the blockchain).

When a bank lends you USD, they don't give you a briefcase full of $100 bills, they just change a number on their internal ledger.
Simialrly, when a (hypothetical) bitcoin bank wants to lend you bitcoins, they wouldn't fork over actual on-chain bitcoins. They would simply change a number in their internal ledger.
Cash and bitcoin are largely equivalent. You can have on-chain transactions (equivalent to actual cash transactions) or off-chain transactions (e.g. Coinbase-to-Coinbase) (equivalent to Bank-to-Bank).
This means that fractional reserve banking is just as easy with bitcoin as it is with cash, and the system crashes when everyone would suddenly decide to withdraw their Bitcoins/cash.
There's really no difference if people don't change their behavior and if they don't change how they store their Bitcoins/cash.

If we're going to post hyperboles, let me have a go:
A smal, restricted blocksize could lead to lower interest of users of the network, leading to fewer participants, fewer miners, lower security, and an ecosystem more vulnerable to centralizing forces (easier to get hold of a large part of the network if there's less competition).
Claim what you want, reality is that the claim that increasing blocksize is the strongest contributor to centralization pressure has little actual substance to it.

Why would any of this stop someone willing to steal from just re-issuing a RBF transaction with an even higher fee?
Even if he has to put a fee worth half the transaction, he still gets the other half back.
@_date: 2015-06-01 11:45:54
A free market would be letting the miners decide which transaction they include and which not. Let the fee find an equilibrium based on this rather than creating an artificial scarcity in block space.
The block size limit should serve as a protection against DDOS-ing the network, not as a way to force fees higher.

If you had actually followed the debates around this topic more thoroughly, you'd know that nothing about the [alternative proposal]( is 'vague as all hell'.
It sounds like you just jumped in recently and without reading any discussion started shouting "20MB NOW IS ONLY OPTION"
Also, now you're some sort of coding expert that claims something is uncodable in a viable way without researching or understanding the actual alternative proposal? Easy to shoot down alternatives like this, but I'll let others decide whether or not such an alternative is a viable option or not.
If time is an issue, then the idea can be explored further while a simpler solution is implemented.


Haven't you been reading what I said? I *do* support 20MB, I just think that before deciding, we still have time to explore better alternatives that won't require us to face a bigger issue of implementing a fork 10 years later with more adoption, and thus a way higher risk.


If the issue turns out to be too urgent, the 20MB fix *will* be implemented, and the discussion about alternatives will still stay relevant for a fix that will be needed in the future. Downside will be, as stated, that it will be much harder to implement another hard fork in the future when there's more at stake.
I have the feeling you're just arguing for the sake of it and that you're putting words in my mouth... I'm not your enemy, your energy is better spent convincing people opposed to any change.

If more than 50% of the miners are willing to deliberately create empty blocks, then we have a bigger problem than the max block size...
@_date: 2015-06-08 10:54:57


The elastic block cap doesn't solve the max block size limit (the writer even states so himself). It is a solution to a different problem: how bitcoin fails when reaching a hard limit. The elastic block cap provides a soft limit, but doesn't solve anything about the actual limit.
An elastic block cap could play part in a solution by allowing for a dynamic max block size. It would prevent miners from artificially increasing the max block size, since this would cost them too much.
@_date: 2015-12-03 12:34:01


Many blocks are in this range because blocks aren't produced in a constant 1 block per 10 minute fashion. For example, a block that is produced after 2 minutes can only include so many transactions.
Additionally, the blockchain should be able to handle transaction spikes in stead of creating a backlog when there is a temporary increase in demand.
So it's not as simple as claiming 1mb blocks is enough because some blocks are only 200kb.
@_date: 2015-06-08 12:51:21
It's not as easy as you put it.
A transaction that is broadcasted on one chain is usually equally valid on the other chain (depends a bit on what changes exactly are implemented). In this case, they'd need to make sure the initial transaction for selling their bonds happens only on the new chain (that they plan to abandon afterwards), which is far from trivial. A different option would be to create two different transactions on the different chains, but again, this isn't trivial, and the receiving party could easily spot this.
Additionally, if there are enough miners that join forces to 'switch back to the old fork', which would probably require more than 51%, then of course there are bigger issues than those you stated...
To put it even stronger, 51% of miners colluding has nothing to do with a hard fork, they could technically similar stuff without needing to collide. And your notion of 'overtaking the new fork side' doesn't make sense: two forks aren't in competition with each other based on blockchain size.
To conclude, I'd like to offer the following saying used in my area: *if my aunt had a penis, it would be my uncle*. There are a lot of hypothetical scenario's that just aren't relevant, or that have far more severe consequences even without taking the initial proposition into account.

The drive from 54k to 100Mbit was not 1 stretch to get to HD video, it was multiple improvements to go from a to b to c, to eventually go to HD video.
Bandwidth isn't simply driven by one idea or tech to aim for. It's more of a continuous push *and* pull drive. Tech X requires a new speed, and once you obtain it, people think of ways they can use it. They come up with Y, which just barely works on this speed, which then creates a new drive for increased speeds, etc.
It's easy now to look back and say that HD video has been the driving factor in all of this, but that was hardly the goal back when we had 56k modems. Was the term HD even coined yet?
Similarly, it is very hard to think about which technologies will continue to drive a speed improvement in the future. Extending the video to higher quality/resolution etc. sounds logic enough, but there's no reason to assume there won't be many other drivers.
Considering that the current tendency is to put everything online (cloud storage/services), to make all devices connected (internet of things), to have more and more communication channels online, I see no reason to believe the demand for increased speeds will diminish anytime soon.

Your post made no mention of what you just quoted here, so I don't see how I failed to address anything you said.
I stand by my claim that there are other major factors playing a role in mining centralization:
- Cheap electricity in China
- Lower variance on income when mining with a bigger pool
If blocksize were the major constraint, then for sure mining pools would simply mine smaller blocks. Why did they lift the soft limits if blocksize had a major impact on orphan rate? It's easy to go around claiming things without backing it up with some actual data. Just looking at real-world behavior of miners tells a different story, though.
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:27:34
That sounds like a decent set-up. Thanks for elaborating.
@_date: 2015-06-08 15:13:44


Except that it doesn't. 
Your scenario happens when a forking event fails and people revert to a pre-fork, and the issue of basically having a double spend performed against you is easily mitigated if you just hold out of making important transactions during this relatively short, time-critical period.
Edit: in addition, my point above stands: *if we focus on the essence and make sure Bitcoin doesn't come crashing down* implies not initiating a fork unless it is clear enough that the general public is in consensus about it (e.g. won't split up 1/3 vs 2/3)
@_date: 2015-06-16 12:01:36
So then let the miner decide which transactions to include that have a sufficiently high fee to offset an increased orphan rate.

You're missing the point completely. I'm no fan of centralization, *no one here is*, or we wouldn't be interested in Bitcoin. I'm just stating a *fact*! Miners will always tend to centralize. Pinning that issue on the current discussion point is just foolish. There are many issues causing centralization, which need to be tackled. You are the one claiming the blocksize is the sole major responsible factor for centralized pressure among the miners, when that is unlikely to be true.
Miners will centralize with a blocksize of 1MB or with a blocksize of 10MB. Preventing the network to grow by restricting blocksize will not solve the centralization issue.


I'm dumbfounded... Having a stronger decentralized network is *exactly that*: increasing the number of stakeholders with a say in the network. This means increasing the number of nodes, increasing the number of participants, and definitely also increasing the number of miners.
@_date: 2015-06-09 11:22:46
Simply raising the max block size without thinking forward is just pushing the problem some time in the future. What will happen when in 10 years we are reaching the 20MB cap? Will it be just as easy to hard-fork and create a higher max block cap, considering that by then the network has probably grown?
I think what is saying is he's more in favor of building a dynamic max block size that adapts based on demand (with possible penalties to create a disincentive for artificially growing it by filling blocks with spam). This would be a lasting solution.

There's a few numbers (one more meaningful than the other of course) that indicate it, such as total amount of transactions, amount of merchants signed up with bitpay/coinbase, etc. These numbers give an indication (they are no fool-proof method though, but you go by what you have).
Next to numbers, there's the amount of large companies that have started accepting it or have hinted at developing a strategy.
As for previous web currencies, given their growth in adoption when they existed, I see a clear indication that there is a demand for such a thing. What usually went wrong was regulatory issues.


With development I'm talking about a broader spectrum of services being offered related to bitcoin. As you said, the decentralized ebay is way too difficult at the moment for the common man, but look at what existed 1 year ago. There are more stable exchanges, there are wallets offering multi-signature addresses. Multi-sig addresses are also beginning to be used by new services in order to be able to provide a service without having full control over customer funds.


It's a bit naive to think that bitcoin can't be regulated. Of course it can. Regulation can't physically stop it, but it can put a dent in it's adoption by the masses (look at what happened when China basically banned most applications). Regulation can also affect the influx of fiat by targetting banks. Sure, people can still buy in cash from someone else, but that's a more convoluted process than using an exchange.
If we have regulation in place that doesn't restrict the use of bitcoin too much, then that is a clear signal for the masses that this will likely not be 'banned' in the future. It would be a signal that bitcoin is OK, it would provide legitimacy to bitcoin.
In other words: if there's no regulation, then the masses will be skeptical because there's a grey zone concerning the legality. The good thing about regulation would not be the regulation itself, but the fact that it removes some uncertainties.

You're mixing up 'max block size' and effective 'block size'. Miners determine the size of the blocks they mine (no larger than max block size), but the *max block size* is determined by all full nodes, not by what the miners mine.

It's not even about the example gave. It's about leaving choices to the individuals. 
People should be able to buy bitcoins using coinbase to send them to whoever they want (not using coinbase). This is covered by the ACH wire and bitcoin transfer to you.
People should also be able to spend bitcoins at merchants, if they chose to. How these merchants handle this is again up to them, if they prefer not to expose them to the volatility risk, they use coinbase or bitpay, which sells the bitcoins on their behalf.
When used in conjunction, these two separate mechanisms appear to have 2 obsolete steps (the Bitcoin part) and this *is* obsolete (except for some edge cases), but that doesn't mean Bitcoin is obsolete for all reasons. The 2 mechanisms above are needed on their own, because not everyone will want to use just another 'PayPal' to buy things online. Not everyone will be able to either.

Building a company is not a zero-sum game. Stock are also not a zero-sum game.

You should account for the difference in global population at different times. So basically get a 'per capita' count in stead of an absolute number.
In other words (and I'm just making up some numbers here): if in 2000, 100.000 people died in wars on a total global population of 6 billion, and in 1927 40.000 people died in wars on a total population of 2 billion, then you could argue that 1927 was worse.

He's saying that, because the risk exists, he's willing to guarantee her she won't lose anything by accepting the bitcoins. Not because bitcoins never drop in value, but because he's willing to pay a bit more if it would drop, to give her the chance of discovering it in a risk-free manner.

Well, to be fair, you're not sending dollars, but IOU's denominated in dollars. This means that you'd have to trust the issuer, which reduces the utility significantly.

You're just creating meta-problems. Calling the 'multitude of proposals' a problem. How is sharing ideas a problem? It's safe to say that everyone who is in favor of a change would rather see any change than none. So the support for the 20MB block cap isn't diminished by proposing more lasting alternatives.


I don't think that's the case.
Everyone who supports change (even the ones 'opposed' to 20MB blocks cause they think there's a better alternative) will likely support the change that will eventually be implemented. Exploring the optimal one is exactly what needs to be done, given of course that this discussion doesn't stretch out for months.
If the devs end up implementing just the 20MB fix, then the dynamic block cap people won't suddenly prefer 'no change'.

Sorry, what you're saying doesn't make much sense.
Banks can provide you interest because the money you deposit is being invested (in loans, etc.)
You can't have interest without an investment.
If you decide to deposit your bitcoins in a bank (giving them control of the private key offcourse), then there is nothing stopping them from using it to make investments (basically running a fractional reserve), lending it to people, in order to get a positive return on it, part of which they could pay you as interest.

Ah ok, that is absolutely correct. I thought you were implying that the hard fork could make other things break without necessarily breaking Bitcoin itself.
In general, I don't think it's necessary to consider too detailed what-if scenario's that are contingent on Bitcoin failing. If we focus on the essence and make sure Bitcoin doesn't come crashing down, it is unlikely that layers built on top of it will break if the changes we make aren't changes of the core protocol functionality.
@_date: 2014-08-26 10:58:34
Interest is simply paying to lend money. Someone gives up current spending power, so requires a compensation for it, by asking for an increqsed future spending power.
Inflation is kept in place to increase the tendency to lend money, due to it reducing in value if kept stagnant.
So interest has nothing to do with inflation. It works with or without inflation. If I lend bitcoin to someone, I would expect interest on it, because I am giving up my ability to spend it now.

Thanks for the reply. I'll elaborate a bit why I said what I said.
Firs of all, I'm not trying to personally attack people currently involved or the technological idea behind Quark.
Why I believe it is a "scam" is because Quark was mined almost completely in a very short period (I know it's got a permanent reward structure), which makes it effectively a premined coin, made with the purpose of the creators to just cash in on the boom of altcoins.
Now you may claim that before launching QuarkCoin, the creator announced it and it's release date, but that doesn't change the equation much. It's a bit like saying 'Here's my new coin, it will be completely mined withing 1 hour'. Doing so is done with the full realization that the majority of coins can be mined by yourself because initially, few people will be aware of it. I'd say QuarkCoin found the best balance between being able to mine as much as possible early on for the creators without making it too obvious to scare off entrants later on.
You can also claim that the situation was similar for Bitcoin, as early on, almost no one was interested and few people could mine a lot of coins. This would be a false comparison, since Bitcoin was not made with the idea to 'cash in on a popular trend to make easy money'. There was no expectation of easy riches for the creator and early miners of bitcoin.

Turn it however you like. Until there are precedents of colored coin 'contracts' being uphold by legal systems over the world, it stays theory. The legal system doesn't always work how it should, nor are all rulings of all judges always logical.

You're judging the sustainability of investments in start-ups by the size of the market cap? Mind expanding on that a bit?
IMO, most investments in this ecosphere are investments made with an outlook of at least 1 year. So the pricepoint at this moment, and even in 3 months, doesn't really play a big factor in whether or not the investments will turn out to be sustainable.
Also note that most startups (in all sectors) fail. Bitcoin won't be an exception.

Some part of the bitcoin price is speculative, derived from it's future expected utility. But another part of its value comes from its current utility value. It being useful as a transaction medium is what makes it valuable to me *Today*.
If all people who are in it solely for its speculative value would start to drop out, and no new speculators would be attracted, that's where you claim the "pyramid scheme" ends. There would still, however, be quite a few people (me included), who still see value in bitcoin for its possible uses. Those people would continue to use it.
There's no pyramid scheme which requires any new users. That would only have been the case if bitcoin itself had no utility and people only bought it with the expectation of it growing in value due to new people entering.

Again, you keep using the official exchange rate (ask anyone in argentina how easy it is to exchange at this official exchange rate), which is far from the actual (black market) exchange rate of about 11 peso's to the dollar. This would bring your prices for bitcoins to 7204 ARS / 11 = 654 USD, or right on par with the market.
There's a reason why their bitcoins are so expensive, the reason is their currency isn't worth anything, and the 'official' exchange rate is arbitrary and not real in practice.

Even if people that want to raise the blocksize are just in it for the money, how can anyone oppose a change that keeps bitcoin as inclusive as possible?
A modest blocksize increase has practically no downsides, it still allows layer 2 solutions (which will definitely be needed), while simultaneously increasing the utility of bitcoin as a layer 1 tool.
The notion that bitcoin can still grow in other directions to become significant (while probably true) is a poor argument for keeping the blocksize smaller than technology and consensus allow. For bitcoin to be as successful as possible on all fronts, it needs to grow on all fronts (taking into account technological constraints).

You can still keep large amounts of gold or cash at a bank, same for bitcoin, you could keep those at a bank.
The thing to realize is that, with bitcoin, you at least aren't obliged to keep it at a bank, and it will be more secure than keeping gold or cash in your home (which is illustrated by OP's story). If done properly, it will even be more secure than holding gold at a bank, or anything for that matter.

Bitcoin probably can't compete if the payment process remains the same. Changing the process could probably increase through-put.
Bitcoin allows payments to be sent by anyone with an internet connection without the need of passing by a physical POS. A merchant/bar/etc could have an app (or alternatives) which enable the customer to initiate a transfer. The check-out would then become more of a verification.

The relevant metric should be how much CO2 created per unit of value transfer, lets say $1 (just arbitrary).
Then to determine whether or not this is an enormous waste of energy, we'd need to compare it to the alternatives. How much energy is used and CO2 created by the current banking system / visa / paypall / etc. How much per $1 of value transferred?
For all we know (I didn't find any numbers), Bitcoin could turn out to be the more ecological option. But maybe it isn't. All I'm saying is to look at the bigger picture, the energy isn't simply 'wasted', it's consumed to provide a service. It might be wasteful compared to alternatives, or it might not be.

Money Laundering laws prevent people getting around taxation as well. So if you believe bitcoin will make corruption worse, then with the same mechanism, it will increase the amount of people evading taxes.

My argument is quite basic at it's core: the utility of money and the desirability comes from the fact that other people want it. Other people using it (and thus repeatedly accepting it for value) is a clear indication people want it. If you can't even argue against that, then that tells more about your argument than about mine. And shouting 'it's wrong' repeatedly doesn't make it so.
Your argument just sticks to the basics (you only really argued that increased velocity means lower value, without considering an expanding user base) and doesn't consider the whole picture, that's why your argument is incomplete.

You compare a government collapsing to bitcoin exchanges going offline to support your point, but you fail to see that one could just as well compare the government continuing to exist to exchanges not going offline.
Bottom line remains that people place value in fiat currency because a government exists, which leads to them trusting the value of the currency to remain. *No one* would place value in a currency if they don't trust in its value, even if a government 'supports' it.

Not really.
Every receiving address would be a new address, unknown to anyone except the receiver and the sender.
This makes it impossible to know where bitcoins are coming from and where they are going. If you would send money to someone, and monitor that address, then eventually, when it gets spent, it will be sent to a completely new address which you (nor anyone else) knows anything about. So you couldn't tell anything about that transaction, except for that it happened.

The current pricing of bitcoin is based on a speculative value of future utility. Of all features of bitcoin, the transaction properties (no boundaries, pseudonomous, quick) are most talked about. I think it's safe to assume people valuing it's future utility do so based on it being used as a transaction medium in the future.
If that doesn't materialize by people using it more (rather than holding it more), then it is not far-fetched to believe the speculative value will go down (why keep it around if no one seems to be interested in using it?).
I fail to see how that assessment is in any way 'absurd'.
Furthermore, everyone *does* make a choice in how they participate in the bitcoin ecosystem. You can opt to hold in hopes of a higher speculative value, or participate in transacting with bitcoin in hopes of trying to materialize this speculative value into something substantial.
Now I'm not saying holding and using it are mutually exclusive, but people chosing to hold it in hopes of it rising in value should be aware of where bitcoin's value comes from.
In other words:
* Holding reduces supply and could push the price higher
* Using it increases demand, which is a far more sustainable way of increasing the price
Chose what *you* do with your bitcoin, I hope it's a healthy mix of both.
Edit: Another note on your second paragraph. It's a description of a system in equilibrium, in which increased velocity indeed reduced the valuation. In a system not yet in equilibrium, velocity, and more generally how much people tend to use something, can (next to a direct effect on the value) also impact the adoption and the utility. So I think you're neglecting other mechanisms at work.

Often insured up to a certain amount only.
And even then, governments have already confiscated deposits (even the US government has...).
*Properly* secured 'fucking' bitcoins can't be lost and can't be stolen (note the emphasis of 'properly', most bitcoins aren't stored/secured properly, hence some of the stories you see here on the frontpage of No one is interested in the non-evenet of bitcoins not going missing). 
Bitcoins don't need to be insured. But you *still* could. Already, there are insurance companies offering insurance to companies holding bitcoins for others.
Don't get me wrong, I trust my bank and my government, and I hold most of my wealth there. I'm just pointing out your fallacies, because *you* are the one shouting about all the supposed downsides to bitcoin.

Lets assume, for the sake of the argument, that your percentages are correct. (I know you didn't state them as fact, but more as general indication, to make a point).
Anyway, if it were true, then that would mean that the money in bitcoin now came from wealthy individuals. The growth potential remaining would then come slightly more from less wealthy individuals, meaning it would be slightly less than a situation in which Bitcoiners were average people. 
So while I might be underestimating the growth potential (do note I do still believe the growth potential is high!), the argument you used was more supportive of the idea that people generally overestimate it.

That's not a concern for merchants in the short-term, since they generally can't use bitcoins anyway to pay their costs.

All data is in the *decentralized* blockchain.
Centralized webpages that process and display the information from the blockchain are just there for convenience.
Any company that needs reliable data will probably not get it from centralized websites. They could just get it from the blockchain itself by running a full node.
Individuals that want reliable data can just check their client which either runs a full node or syncs with one. Again, here is no need for trust in a centralized webpage. Only some trust in one of many full nodes.
Anyway, this is basically a non-issue. As soon as something fishy happens, it will soon be caught (very easy to verify data) and everyone will move away from the fishy service.

I'm personally not sold on the idea of companies selling ASICs or hashing power myself, but there *is* one thing you're overlooking.
Selling shares frees up capital to invest more. The net effect for a company could be positive. Here's a simplified example: lets presume a miner costs $1000 and its return is $1200.
* Company (A) buys 1 miner and lets is mine to create a $200 profit.
* Company (B) buys 1 miner and sells a 'share' signifying 90% of a miner for $1000, invest that money to buy another miner for $1000. The return is now $2400, of which $1080 (90% of $1200) goes to the owner of the share. The profit for the company is now $320.
In general, scaling operations can lead to a profit that is proportionally larger than the unscaled operation. The reason this works is that the company could probably buy the same miners for a lower price than an individual consumer, due to buying larger quantities.

I like how you call a single downvote "being downvoted so hard".
But to get to the core of your post, it's somewhat true that BTC currently doesn't offer that much added utility over current payment methods. The reason being that it can only offer a lot of benefits if it becomes more useful in itself by not needing exchanges or re-conversion to the existing system. Guess what could cause that? Increased adoption. So it's a bit of the chicken and the egg question.
Which brings me to the next point. The thing BTC really offers is not some get-rich-quick dream (although I'm sure there's plenty of people with that vantage point). What bitcoin offers is increased utility, on the condition that it is adopted. That's enough incentive for a lot of people to be involved in bitcoin.
You don't seem to really know much about bitcoin exchanges, because there are plenty exchanges (and 'brokers') operating in North America. CaVirtex in Canada to name one. Coinbase (not really an exchange) in the US, Kraken in a limited amount of states. If you consider that to be "ZERO", then you might need to go back to math class.
What exactly is your real problem with Bitcoin? Because I don't believe your arguments are what is really bothering you.

As for the rest of your reply, I'm all for trying to educate people by showing what is 'wrong' (according to us) with the current system, but the point remains that most people are content with the current system, and they are only interested if something new makes things easier for them.
The difference between the current system, and the bitcoin system resembling the current system is the freedom of choice, financial freedom (and I explained this in my previous post already).
Your ideal would be just as oppressing as the current system, forcing everyone to use only bitcoin, and nothing in addition. That wouldn't be financial freedom.

Maybe my wording was poorly chosen, as the existing legal framework should already be capable of solving disputes.

This is indeed the danger with fiat currencies, but one must realize that the collapse of said currency isn't directly because of the mismanagement, it is due to the lack of trust that this mismanagement causes. In essence, the only thing giving value to fiat currencies isn't some sort of imaginary backing (because there is none), but it is trust placed in the ecosystem of this currency. Whether or not the ecosystem of Bitcoin could grow to sufficient proportion to obtain a similar trust is debatable, but claiming that it inherently doesn't have any value just doesn't make much sense. 


A debatable topic, but I believe this is far from a problem for Bitcoin. The trust that would be placed in Bitcoin and its value would come from the belief in this unforgeability, combined with the trust that others keep valuing it. This creates a networking effect which is very unlikely to allow "millions of unforgeable currencies" in the ecosystem. Why would I place value in a new altcoin when I already have Bitcoin?


Volume of a currency is an increase in spending/transactions in said currency. I don't see any link with "diversifying between stocks of the same market". Diversification between stocks lead to a lower volatility of your total portfolio in a completely different way that an increase in transactional volume could lead to a lower volatility of a currency.
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:01:07


It's not at all 'insanely' untrue.
Buying bitcoins on an exchange is no different from buying other currencies. You pay an exchange fee, which is not fundamental to the system. It wouldn't really be fair to explain to a USD user that EUR transactions come at a large fee solely due to the exchange rate. That's a conversion fee, not a transaction fee.
As for the actual transaction fee, coins that have been unspent for a sufficient time period can be sent without a transaction fee! So it is totally possible to use the system without paying transaction fees.
So even though I agree that it's a bit more complicated than just calling it "transactions for free", it is not at all far from the truth.

*You* are the one who started the whole 'pegging' discussion. Suddenly, when we're discussing other assets than bitcoin, it's perfectly ok if the 'pegging' you're talking about is simply done by the market.
But if the same is done for bitcoin, in which the market also derives it's value generally based on whatever stuff happens, then that doesn't count as being pegged?

I fully agree with what you say here. There's a few points I can make to put in perspective the fact that the owner called the cops, but I'll stick to one:
You have stated multiple times in other posts that the owner isn't "really accepting" bitcoin, but he's accepting pesos through a payment processor. If that is your stance, then please, explain to me what is the difference (from a legal stance) between a *credit card* and *bitcoin through payment processor*?
Surely in both cases, he's "really accepting" pesos, so both payment mechanisms should be treated equally. If for either of both, the network goes down, why should the owner look for a solution with credit card, but not with bitcoin?
Calling the cops on someone who *wants* to pay, using a service you claimed to accept, is jumping the gun a little. The meaning of "legal tender" doesn't even enter this equation.

I just made a very minor edit to my first sentence to better reflect my view.
It wasn't so much about buying into bitcoin (although it *was* risky the stronger the hype became), but more on buying bitcoin on Mt.Gox, which had shown it wasn't really reliable due to multiple issues it had.
I can imagine some situations where you'd end up with money/bitcoins on Mt.Gox without really being at fault, but most people that had coins on Gox took a risk, knowingly, and lost. It's a pity, but I don't really feel bad for them.

To be fair, once all coins are mined, the monetary base will shrink as coins are lost. The demand for coins will likely rise as the global population grows.

Here's what you're forgetting: identity theft is far easier and more widespread. Just think of all the places where you hand out your identity, all the services for which you have to show an id, or even scan and send an id. If at any point, there is a breach in either your security or a third party's security, your identity could be out in the open. In bitcoin, your private key is never exposed. The only way to get to your private key is by breaking your personal security.
I will concede that keeping bitcoins secured isn't as easy for the average joe as it should be, but that argument doesn't stand up against how easily your identity could be stolen (and you couldn't even do anything against it).

That's not really the assumption, though.
Fees that are charged are not directly related to the cost of transactions (and thus not directly related to the efficiency of a system), but to what the market is willing to pay for a certain service.
In a centralized system, people can't avoid relatively high fees, because there is barely any competition in the space (due to it being centralized).
In a decentralized system, there is massive competition to process transactions ("everyone can participate"), leading to lower fees than in a centralized system. Fees in such system will thus more reflect the actual cost of processing transactions.

If they receive bitcoin, they can safely convert it to fiat almost instantly, as they don't have to worry about chargebacks.
If they receive a payment in Fiat, they have no guarantee that a chargeback will not happen, and thus it would be very risky to convert it to bitcoin and send those to a would-be receiver. They can't charge-back the bitcoin transaction. So they'd need additional layers of protection in place for such transactions, possibly raise fees for such transactions to account for fraud etc.

Statistically speaking, if you expect the price to go up, investing the intended amount immediately (given that it is available) yields the best return.
The downside is that the variance on the possible return is higher, and if you're unlucky, it's possible you invest at a peak.
So cost averaging over time leads to a lower return on average, but it will also make you not exposed to the risk of buying in on a peak.

That's a very good point. I guess a lot of people will have the feeling that the distribution model is/was unfair. And I'd say I agree with that sentiment for the most part. I'd say the bitcoin distribution model *is* somewhat unfair. The thing that counterbalances this, is the risk coupled to it. For a high risk system to survive, the reward must be proportional to this risk, which leads to higher rewards at the beginning than later on. In retrospect, when you already know the outcome, the risk doesn't appear the same, and the distribution/reward model appears unfair.
You could probably argue the same for Quark, but for some reason, it appears more unfair to me. Maybe it's perception, maybe it's because Quark is at a later stage (mining-wise), but a part remains the premeditated setup to ride the altcoin boom (which is why I consider most altcoins 'scammy'). Altcoins in general prey on the people who have the feeling they 'missed out' on the bitcoin boom by introducing marginal 'improvement'.

This is a conclusion based on only part of the equation.
All the bitcoins sold by merchants are bought by someone (every sale must have a buyer and a seller).

Because we have hardly any hard figures, we can't really conclude anything. We can only guess whether or not merchants instantly converting leads to downward pressure or positive pressure.

That's not evidence supporting your statement. This is simply supply and demand mechanics. Due to a failing Gox, people couldn't get their fiat money out, so there's a localized increased demand for BTC, thus higher prices.
There is no 'faked pump of the price', only Gox failing.

(Before the rest of this post, my reply wasn't so much about the efficiency of a market, but more about the part I quoted. That this insider trader would somehow prevent some people from buying in at an inflated price.)
From the perspective of the 'correct' market value being reached, insider trading is no different than other trading.
The issue is that insider trading leads to people being in a disadvantage by not having the same information. Without this information, the insider trader can probably sell into an order book and achieve an overall higher value for his holding. If everyone gets the information at the same time, this order book will probably thin out quite a bit, and the playing field is at least even.
The equilibrium market value will be reached at a later time, but most likely with less resistance putting no one at a disadvantage, because everyone had the same info at the same time.

If velocity goes up, then that means people hold it for shorter time periods, meaning that the same amount of bitcoins could support a higher demand.
The existing bitcoin users could start using it more often (but keeping their total amount of bitcoins in balance equal). This would lead to a higher velocity without increasing the demand for bitcoins.
The higher the velocity of a currenty, the less of it you need to support an equal amount of traded value.

That doesn't even make sense. Coinbase derives it's price from Bitcoin exchanges. So as long as Coinbase just sits there holding the bitcoins they received in processing a merchant transaction, the price won't move. It's only at the time Coinbase would actually sell bitcoins on an exchange that they would influence the price.
If Coinbase holds the bitcoins and waits for a buyer, then this would even alleviate the direct negative effect on the price.
But even if it wouldn't function like this, my initial point would *still* stand. To determine the net effect on the price, you'd still need to factor in both effects (selling of bitcoin vs possible increase in demand).

There are 1 million blockchain.info accounts, if I recall correctly. Combined with all other services etc. I wouldn't be surprised there are more than 1 million people involved in bitcoin. Not much of a stretch to see 1 million people owning some bitcoin or a fraction of a bitcoin. I'd even say that not even 10% of bitcoin users has a blockchain.info account.
Using a different approach shows there are currently 2,400,000 bitcoin addresses with a positive balance. People usually own multiple addresses, but then again, funds of different people on exchanges are usually pooled, leading to &lt;1 addresses per person for a lot of online wallets. So my guess is about 2 million people owning bitcoin isn't too far off.
This would indicate there is still a lot of potential growth in user base. The question is: in which way does this relate to actual potential growth in price?
We have to take into account that the current price, to great effect, reflects the expected future potential of bitcoin. So it's hard to determine just how much margin there is still left.
I believe it is still quite a bit, but claiming something along the lines of "only 1% of everyone has bitcoin now, thus it will grow x100 still" isn't correct.

We will probably only ever be able to model things, to approximate it. The goal is indeed to continue and improve our understanding of reality. If we need different theories for different scenarios, this indeed means that we should continue looking for better ones that describe reality better.
All of this, however, doesn't mean that current models and theories can't be used for technological progress. Engineers shouldn't wait for complete theories. If you see the shadow of an octahedron as a square, and your model allows you to make meaningful predictions, then there is nothing wrong with using this model. No one implied you shouldn't continue looking for a better model, that is the outset of scientific research.

If Mt.Gox opens withdrawals, everyone on Gox holding cash now will want to buy Bitcoins to get their money out of Gox. Since it is very likely most people will prefer to withdraw their coins instead of selling them at below market value on Gox, the demand will outpace the supply on Gox.
Price on Gox will likely surpass other exchanges due to this short bitcoin supply and the high demand from people wanting to get out of Gox. This might cause the inverse of what happened now and might lead to price rises on other exchanges.
Another effect might be that prices on other exchanges slip a bit due to additional supply (that is, if most people decide to get out of Bitcoin). But on the other hand, reinstated confidence might also lead to more people buying on other exchanges, and thus higher buying pressure.
Don't take all of this as anything more than another possible scenario. It's impossible to predict exactly what would happen.
But all of this was a bit besides my point. My point is that no matter what scenario you consider, concluding anything on the long-term is pointless. Worse things have happened with bitcoin in the past, and it's still here. This doesn't guarantee that this time it will be the same, but it does show that there's no way to predict what will happen, especially long-term.

That's just plain wrong and misguided.
There are two major reasons people buy (and hoard) bitcoins:
* Because they expect more people to want to buy and hoard bitcoins in the future
* Because they expect bitcoin to become a major currency in the future
Hoarding bitcoins really only plays into the first point, as it doesn't create an incentive to use it as a currency or to build facilities/services to use it as a currency.
Using bitcoins *does* serve both points, as it is a step towards a better acceptance as a currency and incentivises the development of services. In addition, something that is a desirable currency automatically becomes an interesting store of value, something to hoard more of. People will *know* they'll always be able to get rid of it for another token of value because there would be an established market for it as a currency.
Don't let a very rudimentary market model (hoarding decreases supply) fool you into believing that it is the most important aspect of getting to increased adoption and a higher price...
@_date: 2014-04-07 08:09:46


I see where you're coming from, and it's true to some extent, but I'd like to add something.
If I talk about bitcoin to people, it's not so much about wanting them to invest in order for my value to appreciate. It's more about wanting other people to enter the ecosystem, in order to make the technology more viable, more usable, and make it evolve and grow faster.
Much like in the early days of the internet. In the beginning, there was as good as no benefit over fax and telephone, but as more and more people joined and the technology grew, it became immensely more useful.
Technologies that rely on some sort of networking effect will always have the 'chicken or the egg' problem. And if everyone would reason there's no use for them to join now, then a lot of major technologies would never have existed.

I'll start off with the main conclusion:
You're making hilariously desperate efforts in proving a point, but the main point you brought up (transaction volume) is an argument on the side that transaction volume has gone *up* more than the graphs seem to indicate (due to lower % of fake transactions now than the past years).
Try again.




The projections aren't as high as hoped/expected, that doesn't give an indication of whether or not adoption increased/decreased...


This is a nice one, read a little further: *A few weeks ago I made a script to look for transaction chains like this in the blockchain, and it turned out they have been going on every day since mid-2010. Currently they account for 20-25% of tx volume but the percentage was much higher in the past (up to 50-60% for some days in 2012). For most of 2014 it was about 15%.*
This seems to indicate that the percentage of faked transactions used to be higher in 2012 and 2013 than in 2014. So that means the actual increase in useful transactions is higher than what we see.
You're giving links to a source that undermine your claim massively. Thanks for that.


Again only an indication that adoption isn't as fast as hoped/expected, doesn't support your claim of no-adoption in any way.


Again, same point as before.


And some more anecdotal information saying nothing else than that some people don't like it. This doesn't mean anything either.


So you're susprised that a price decline of bitcoin leads to lower purchasing power and thus less spending than expected? And you're comparing their initial bitcoin revenue (at a time they were one of a few companies accepting it and it was quite hyped) to their revenue now? This is the only part of your claim that carries any weight, and it isn't even much.

The main flaw in the article is in the following part:


The writer completely ignores that those new bitcoin customers are into bitcoin for a reason. Irrespective of what this reason is (be it to speculate or to use it, etc.), it doesn't change due to Microsoft's announcement, so it is much more likely that they *will* buy the amount they spent. If they wanted to diminish their stake in bitcoin, there's no reason they wouldn't already have done so before the announcement by simply selling some.
So it's unlikely that Microsoft will create a net downward pressure on the price. The same goes for any merchant accepting bitcoin payments.

If it's just to see the current price, then they don't need a chart for it. Stock charts are designed to see price movement in time, so there isn't a single reason to plot one in non-log scale.

You're correct.
People should start using it more in order to create a more robust, stable ecosystem. Just hoarding it makes it very susceptible to volatility, since the liquidity would be a lot lower.
More people using it would increase utility and would likely lead to more people wanting to use it. It's this positive feedback loop that would spread it's adoption faster than exclusively hoarding it.

Agreed that the situation isn't ideal, but the transaction fee is not in place to reward miners (it only constitutes very little of the total reward). It is in place to avoid bloating/spamming of the network and the blockchain. 
If there was no transaction fee, the whole network would likely be unusable due to a few malicious players that could send out a massive amount of tiny transactions, which would lead to a very large amount of bandwidth usage and storage needed to store a massively bloated blockchain.

Where do you get $3/GHash?
$3 at current bitcoin price (~$800/BTC) is 3.75 mBTC.
1 GHash is about 0.000005% of the total hashing power.
It would thus on average get 0.00125 mBTC per block (at current block reward of 25).
Ignoring the rising hashing power, this means that the investment of 3.75 mBTC would be earned back in about 3000 blocks or with average block time taken at 10 minutes, in about 21 days.
Rising total network power and difficulty leads to a larger time than the 21 days estimate, but still, this doesn't look like such a bad deal...

Ok, this post finally makes it clearer how you see things.
You shouldn't however claim any theory to be "correct" or "incorrect". That doesn't make much sense in a scientific setting. Different theories can hold merrit in different scenario's, and you could rank them in accuracy given the scenario.
Theories are useful if they show a good predictability of phenomenons. You should indeed not use quantum mechanics to describe planetary movement (although it does *not* break down on a macro scale!) Planets still show wave-like characteristics. The amplitude of these waves is, however, negligible compared to the size of the planets. This makes quantum mechanics not useful to describe phenomenons of planetary movement because they would overcomplicate things.
Newtonian physics do not describe the complete picture (and you probably claim it is thus "wrong"), but the fact remains that for most day-to-day problems, they are more than sufficient in predicting gravitational phenomenons. There is no need for a more complete, more complex theory when you simply need to construct a house.
In a similar fashion, quantum mechanics still doesn't describe the whole picture, but this doesn't mean it isn't useful for describing and predicting certain phenomenons.
Your theory (with the vortexes), could very well be a more complete one (I didn't have the time to check up on it). This should be falsifiable, modern science can verify if this theory holds any merit, and if it doesn't then this is likely because it doesn't describe phenomenons any better than existing theories (and not because modern science would be dogmatic, because it is the opposite...). If it does describe phenomenons more accurately, then all the better, but it will likely still fall short of some things we didn't even think about up til now.
I think you have a wrong vision of the goal of science. The goal is to create theories that can model reality as best as possible. Claiming a theory is "incorrect" is probably expressing badly that a theory is incomplete (as in: doesn't describe all physical phenomenons), but an incomplete theory can still predict and model accurately within its constraints, and thus provide tools to build applications.

In my opinion, the bitcoin network growing in value will be inherently coupled to the bitcoin currency growing in value.
The internet as a whole gained value due to more and more information being transferred to more different parties and services that joined. Similarly, the bitcoin network will increase in value as a whole by more people and services using it and building on top of it. 
For the internet, this growth was simple and was possible due to more infrastructure increasing the amount of data transfer necessary. For bitcoin, however, there are a limited amount of mechanisms that would allow the amount of transferred value to increase:
* Increasing the amount of bitcoins available for use
* Increasing the velocity of bitcoins, so that the same number can be used by more people
* Increase in price of bitcoins, so that the same number of bitcoins can be used by more people
The first mechanism is limited, due to the nature of the bitcoin supply. The second mechanism will likely increase as well when more people use and accept it, but it will reach a limit (probably close to the velocity of fiat currencies). The only mechanism that can continue to allow the value of the bitcoin network to grow further is the third.

Of course you don't invest in the service Bitcoin provides by buying bitcoins. But again, similarly, you don't invest in a company product or service by buying stock on a stock exchange. You buy the stock from a previous stock owner, and none of that money goes towards the company producing anything.
The only stock money that goes to the company is in the issuing of new stock (I only consider the basic mechanisms of stock and stock issuing here). Then, again, in Bitcoin, new issued bitcoins are rewarded to the miners, who are providing the service. So equally, the initial sale of a Bitcoin is money that flows to the miners to provide the service.
Now you can argue about the actual utility of Bitcoin and the value it actually brings, but that would be sidestepping the point here, similar arguments could even be made for various companies.
The main point which I'm trying to convey is that there is no difference between Bitcoin and stock concerning the aspects we're discussing here (the zero-sum question and *how* value is determined for stock and bitcoin).

Not agreeing with what is said doesn't mean I didn't read it... Don't jump to conclusions and try to debate me on the points at hand, and don't use some defense-mechanism by claiming I didn't read it.
Your claim that hoarding the currency somehow increases liquidity is laughable, that's not how it work. Hoarding something has an inverse effect on its liquidity...
The market cap point is somewhat valid, but it is also a clear example of diminishing returns. It's true you do need a sizable market cap in order to be able to facilitate larger transactions, but this effect on making the currency more useful wears out pretty quickly, especially when everyone hoards it and no one has interest in using it as a currency.
So I stand by my claim that there's no better way to speed up adoption and increased utility than by using it. I must admit I would also prefer to have it the easy way and just keep my bitcoins safely doing nothing to get rich, but claiming that's what is best doesn't magically make it so...

On the lowest level, the current financial transfer system is also irreversible and also places the security burden on the participants. The difference is there is no option for anyone to participate in it. In bitcoin, this option *is* present, and if you don't want to, you can use systems built on top of it, which would have the same functionality you have now.
It's not about forcing anyone, it's about providing a choice.


In bitcoinpedia, here's how it *could* work (as opposed to how you painted the picture): People have the title in the form of a 2 out of 3 addresses, one held by the actual owner, 2 held by two different third parties. Transferring the title requires 2 parties to agree. If the thief hacks your phone, he could try to transfer the title to his name, but neither of the third parties would agree, as the transfer wasn't initiated by you. If either of the two third parties would make a mistake, you have your title and the other third party to enforce your claim.
And that's just *one* hypothesis of how you could arrange it in bitcointopia.

You didn't lose USD, but you *did* lose value.
I'm tired of reading this. At any given point in time, you have the value of your assets at that point in time. The fact that something is still in Bitcoin doesn't mean its value is any less real.
If you have bitcoins, and the price drops, you lose value. Whether or not you cash it out is quite irrelevant.

A lot of people also have all their funds online:

The short-term effect of people using it might indeed be negative, but in the big picture, we need it all. We need more bitcoin services, but this would only make sense if people also use it more and indicate they would continue using it even more if these additional services were to surface.
Paying a service that immediately converts to USD might not help the price, but it helps the ecosystem of bitcoin *a lot*. It shows that there is a growing group of people willing to use bitcoin. That is the most important aspect in the long-term.

Using the coinbase wallet app is risky because coinbase often doesn't immediately broadcast transactions.
For this purpose, it's safer to use an app that holds the private keys itself and that can immediately broadcasts the transaction without depending on 3rd party servers (e.g. Mycelium).
@_date: 2014-09-01 12:49:18
If you leave out 2 and 3, then the transaction changes from a bitcoin transaction into a coinbase (paypal-like) transaction. You leave out all people not using coinbase (due to having no access to it, or no desire to use a third party).
The goal is not to force everyone to use bitcoin, nor to force everyone to use coinbase. The goal is to let the choice to the individuals. People who don't care about bitcoin could use coinbase, which could net them a reduction in fees. People who don't use coinbase can still just as well send bitcoins to the merchant (which will be converted to local currency for the merchant).
So, on the surface, it looks like an unnecessary 2 extra steps (which, in the example you give, are indeed redundant). But these extra steps are not simply added to use some arbitrary currency, they are the core transactions which are needed not to exclude anyone. Step 1 and 2 combined and step 3 and 4 combined are in fact two separate options which should work separately, otherwise you lose a large chunk of the things you could do.

I was simply pointing out the irrelevance of your statement. Too many bitcoin opponents just fall back on their standard comments without putting any effort in their posts whatsoever.


What, which metric indicates this 'collapse' you're talking about... Seriously? At most there was a decline, calling that a 'collapse' is in all ways exaggerating.
And even if the total sales went down, it could still go hand in hand with more users using it (though spending less per use). I'm not making claims as to whether this would be good or bad, but it wouldn't fit with your 'collapse on any metric' story.
And another point, you're probably comparing hype/bubble data with the current trends, which also doesn't consider the whole picture. Of course people will be more enthusiastic during a hype/price-spike period, which makes it hard to say something conclusive about the overall trend.
As much as bitcoin enthusiasts need to put things in perspective and look at a broader picture, the same can very well be said about bitcoin opponents...

Thinking it was a good idea doesn't make it one.
Weighing the pro's:
* marketability (having a 'cool' address)
* recognisability (people can verify more easily that they are sending to the correct address)
versus the cons:
* reduced security due to repeatedly using the same address and thus exposing the public key
* reduced privacy for the user of the address, everyone can link the address to you/your business and see exactly how many funds you receive
* reduced privacy for the sender because he links his addresses to yours
* The verification of the address by looking at the beginning of the vanity address can easily be abused (and has been). It's quite trivial for an attacker to generate a vanity address with the same leading characters and then pretending to be you. This is probably the main point making it definitely a bad idea, because the only point going in favor of vanity addresses is the strongest weakness it has as well... You get the feeling of security, while in fact, it's probably reduced.
Indicates it's probably not such a good idea, no matter what "thousands" think. Granted, some of the cons are general bad practices possible with regular addresses as well, but vanity addresses force you into those bad practices.

Bitcoin is a token of value, merchants accept that value and convert it to something not exposing them to risks (quite logical thing to do).

You understand very little of the scientific method of research.
Your hypothesis for the mechanism of flipping a coin could be studied and indeed would show a predictability of 50%. If there were no better model to describe flipping a coin, yours would be accepted as being the most accurate. There is no absolute "correctness" in science. If a better model would be found, this would be posed as a new hypothesis. After scientific study could show that a new model (predicting 50% heads *and* 50% tails) would have a better predictability and description of a phenomenon, this would become the newly accepted model. No one would proclaim this to be 100% correct or claim it describes things outside its scope.
Your claim that anything quantum is wrong because it doesn't describe all possible phenomenons in the universe stays laughable and indicates you understand very little of what the purpose an methods of modern science are.

BitPay is the way to go, IMO, until Coinbase truly steps it up. Haven't heard many positive stories yet about Coinbase.
Using and legitimizing Coinbase also leads to more people using their wallet, which is known to work horribly by delaying transactions instead of sending them directly. Every week there's a new story of someone in a restaurant or store trying to pay a BitPay invoice from a Coinbase wallet, only for the invoice to time out and the person having to pay in a different way, all due to the transaction never actually being sent on the blockchain until it's already way too late.

A few point here.
Calling 3% small is just not understanding the slim profit margins that are present in a competitive environment.
There's different mechanisms determining the price of a product. The main one being a value-based price, e.g. putting it at the highest price the majority of people will want to pay. So here, psychology plays a huge role, as you point out, and bitcoin appears to not bring any added value here.
Next, price gets determined by competition. Competition pushes down this value based price towards the cost based minimum that one could ask for a product or service. A lower minimum profitable price inevitably allows for more competition in the market space, and thus generally leads to a lower price.
It appears you stick to the first mechanism, and keep ignoring the second.
Besides that, you must not do groceries very often? Or generally buy things very often? Where I shop, a $4.85 valued product in a competitive market (e.g. food) doesn't get rounded up to $4.99, which happens to be about 3%.
I'd say believing lower costs *don't* affect the price in any way is the naive stance to take.

You couldn't be more wrong on this point.
Companies need to pay suppliers and/or justify decisions towards stakeholders. As long as Bitcoin is volatile (which will probably remain for quite some time still), the *only* way for them to partake in the Bitcoin economy is to use solutions provided by intermediary parties like Bitpay.
This is already one part of the transaction chain filled in (customer -&gt; merchant). Other parts are hard to fill in due to the nature of Bitcoin being still a rather immature technology.
Your claim that already using Bitcoin for just a part of the chain is "redundant" and "not particularly helpful" is plain wrong.
This creates utility for Bitcoin, which is *very* helpful, and even *necessary* for Bitcoin to grow. Only this will lead to further adoption and eventually more stability and utility in other parts of the transactional chain (merchant -&gt; supplier) or (company -&gt; employee).

All inputs of a transaction are unrelated because they represent individual transactions on addresses never used before (and thus impossible to link to anything).
All outputs are equally all new addresses generated for the specific transaction (and thus also impossible to link to anything).
No matter how much statistical analysis you perform, you won't have any data since all addresses have only ever been used once. *Only* the sender and receiver can identify the addresses.
This is exactly what a tumbler tries to (poorly) accomplish. Why a tumbler is a poor solution is because people use addresses in a bad way (regarding anonymity). Statistical analysis can, in a tumbler situation, be useful because there are input and exit points. With stealth addresses and proper use of the bitcoin protocol, there are *no* input and exit points. Every single transaction goes to a new address, preventing such a situation to arise.
Please read up on stealth addresses before arguing any further.

You might want to read up some more on the bitcoin protocol. The address is a hash of the public key. This means that exposing the public key leads to one layer of security (the hash to get the address) being removed. Granted, it's still probably secure enough, but who knows what technological advances happen in the cryptography world.


Agreed, there is a limited amount of businesses where removing financial privacy is not undesired. Charities, for example, could use a model to 'prove' the received funds are spent in a certain way. But for the majority of businesses, it would not be favorable.


Well, since you like to argue *for* vanity addresses, it seems you don't hold your privacy that high. And a lot of new or uninformed people could pick it up not realizing the consequences. Why even go there when it can be prevented from the start?


True, but that doesn't make vanity addresses any better. The fact that it provides little benefit and allows for easier scamming of people just shows that it *is* a bad idea. This last claim is a bit like having a diamond *doom button* on your keyboard that blows up your PC when you push it. It might look pretty and cool, and you can pay attention not to push it, but that doesn't all of a sudden make it a good idea.

The private keys are calculated based off a seed by taking a hash of the seed. Since a hash is a one-way function, the resulting private key doesn't give any info about the seed, and thus doesn't provide any way to obtain other private keys that would be generated by it.
Here's a basic example (not actually the way most deterministic wallets work, but a simplified example): *To generate a private key take SHA256(string + n), where n is an ASCII-coded number that starts from 1 and increments as additional keys are needed.*

Overwriting with zeros doesn't completely remove the data (depending on how many overwrites happened).

I think your concern is correct. If both your computer (which stores one of your keys) and your Bitgo account were compromised, your bitcoins would probably be stolen.
This can somewhat be mitigated by using 2FA, good passwords and other common security practices, but a breach of this kind would render this m-of-n solution to webwallets not any safer than regular webwallets.
The security benefit lies in being protected against a breach of the security of the service provider, which would already be a step forward. You could remove most of the trust you'd need to place in a third party.

As compared to what exactly? I don't have any numbers, but I'm positive the current banking system consumes quite a lot of energy as well. All comes down to which alternative is the least energy consuming. (Don't ask me, I wouldn't know, I just wanted to point out that isolating the energy consumption of bitcoin doesn't really make sense)


Regular people were not sophisticated enough to use the internet anno 1985. While your point is not untrue, it is rather irrelevant. It's not because something doesn't work yet now, that it therefore will never work.


Somewhat valid point. It's a hurdle bitcoin should overcome, maybe it won't, but I believe it will.


Basically the same as the previous point.


Not invalid, but extremely unlikely and costly.


A point which definitely slows down adoption, but not something that can't be avoided. Dedicated hardware can basically get around this.


In most practical instances, you wouldn't need confirmations. Truly trying to double spend is way too costly for low value transactions. High value transactions rarely require a processing time shorter than what bitcoin provides.


Valid point. And probably one of the main reasons one would still stay away from bitcoin for now. This will likely go down as adoption improves.


Cash is also irreversible, but it is still used quite a lot. A value transfer method without third party can, per definition, not be reversible. That doesn't stop anyone from using the possibilities the system has (such as multisignature addresses in bitcoin) to build this feature on top of it.


Don't really see how this would be an issue...

Lets presume the percentages are correct.
2% owns Bitcoins


They say 'only', but this is quite a big number. It means that 16% of the participants that don't own bitcoin claim they would consider using it.


It's not surprising that most people think more highly as gold. But then again, at least 3% of non-bitcoin holders prefer it over gold! If the poll would be representative of the US population, this means that (when comparing to current holders) there is 1.5 times as many people that don't hold it (yet) but see more value and potential in it than in gold.


Only a minority see it as a threat to the global economy. Hurting the U.S. dollar is likely inevitable if it would continue to gain major traction. So nothing alarming here either.

Not too hard to think of a system.
2-of-2 addresses could be used. Someone wanting to buy in to Counterparty has one of the private keys, the charity has the other. During the "proof-of-burn" period, people would send the amount they want to put in into the 2-of-2 address. As soon as this period is over, the "start amount of XCP's" is determined, and then the charity initiates the action of trying to get the funds from the 2-of-2 address. Either the one buying into XCP signs with his key to fund the charity, or he doesn't (and then the coins are essentially burned).
Probably different schemes can be thought out to create similar functionality of making bitcoins end up at a charity.

That's very true when you're talking about stock.
The reason being that stock doesn't get increased utility (and thus value) from more people having and using it (edit: you can't really 'use' a stock anyway). When too many people are interested in it and buy it only because they expect it to increase in value, it is very likely to be overvalued.
This is a point where bitcoin is fundamentally different from stock. More people owning and using bitcoin increases its utility. So even though a lot of people might be buying it because they expect it to increase in value, them doing so actually creates more utility, and thus increases its value.

An address has a matching public key and private key. "Generating an address" is simply generating a private key, from this private key, a public key can be calculated and an accompanying address.
The password you're talking about is simply a password for the encryption of your private key. This is not related to how bitcoin works or the blockchain.

To the outside world, there is 0 difference between someone who modifies part of the parameters of a core node and recompiles, and someone who uses a client that has the parameter configurable to change it. 
The thing that prevents users from changing a parameter is not whether or not it is configurable in the client (because a user that wants to change something already has the option to do so).
What *does* prevent a user from changing a parameter is, as you also stated, the consensus, which is reached through game theory at work.

Well, as I see it, for Bitcoin to continue to bring value, the most important parameter is the amount of transactions that can be processed. This parameter going up likely means more people using it for a more diverse set of things.
All other parameters are secondary. If the amount of nodes decreasing is an issue (and I agree that it would likely not be beneficial), then a solution must be found for this issue, but not by preventing progress on the primary parameter.
The number of nodes decreasing is not as detrimental as people not being able to send transactions in a reasonable time. One affects the utility directly, the other is an issue for which a solution can be researched without affecting the utility.

Consensus-as-a-rule doesn't exist, people aren't following consensus because it's imposed as a rule, they follow consensus because it's in their best interest. Determining what is in people's best interest is done by game theory.
As stated in my previous post, there is 0 difference on consensus / incentive / game theory level between being able to change parameters via a slider or by having to change some code and recompile. The only thing that changes is the method to make such change, not whether or not it's possible to make it.

On a more serious note: you're missing the point of bitcoin, and you don't seem to truly understand what added value it brings.
There is nothing wrong with a re-purposed PayPal. What is wrong is that you'd be forced to use it due to no alternative. Bitcoin brings the added value here that the underlying value transfer can happens in bitcoin instead of on an internal ledger. This means that if either the buyer or the seller opts to use this third party, the other party will *not* be forced to use it as well (such as is the case for PayPal now). They can stick to using plain bitcoin, or even use another third party.
In the cases where both receiving and sending party happen to be using the same third party, the value transfer will happen on an internal ledger, but that's fine, because they both chose to use it. And it *still* doesn't force anyone else to use the same third party if they want to transact with them.
And *that* is the whole point to bitcoin and financial freedom. That is the reason why there is nothing bad about PayPal-like third parties making use of Bitcoin. Even the contrary, it will lower the threshold for new people using bitcoin, and it can never force anyone to use their system.

A few remarks.
You are comparing different aspects to arrive at your conclusion. For Bitcoin, you're talking about money in in the form of mining expenses and money out in the form of reduced transaction cost. In company stock, this would correspond to operational costs and value of the product/service. Which could also be negative for a company.
Second, in reality, the price of a company stock is only determined by the market, by supply and demand of a given stock. This market perception is influenced by how the company performs, but there is no real coupling between the stock value and the produced assets. For bitcoin, the same argument could be made. The price of a unit is only determined by supply and demand. This is, again, influenced by how the protocol performs and what happens in the bitcoin sphere, but is again not coupled to the actual benefit (or downside) the technology could bring, only influenced by it.
So I don't see the difference between bitcoin and stock, or any other asset for that matter.

It all depends on the topology of the network around a specific node. 
If it's a well connected node on which a lot of other nodes rely, then generally, it will be sending each transaction it receives multiple times. In such a case the bandwidth savings of thin blocks will probably be closer to 15%.
If it's a lesser connected node, an edge node, then the bandwidth savings can be closer to 50%.

If bitcoin is worth $1, the total value of all bitcoins (currently) would be $13 million.
Now what if you would like to make a huge transaction of $50 million?
This is a bit of an extreme example to illustrate the point, but similarly, if 1 million people want to make a transaction of $50 at about the same time, you wouldn't have enough value in bitcoin to support this. Or the velocity would need to be very high.
@_date: 2015-01-26 15:58:28


This is valid only to a certain degree. To be able to transfer large amounts, a sufficiently high price is needed. The causality direction of high value transfers, however, will rather be price determining it's use, and not desired use determining it's price (i.e. if someone wants to transfer more than he can with bitcoin, that person will rather choose a different vehicle than increase the price of bitcoin by buying with a ton of slippage).
For most applications, the price *is* actually quite separate from the utility.
Price will also be determined by velocity. The velocity of bitcoin could go up alongside the demand for coins, and thus not necessarily lead to a price rise.


These investors could just as well invest in Bitcoin companies, rather than invest in bitcoin directly. So, again, no guarantee for a price rise.
The most likely is a combination of effects, and bitcoin rising in price as utility and adoption rises, but theoretically speaking, this is no absolute law.

That's not entirely true. Following the spirit/definition of EB and AD, the current nodes have the equivalent of EB =1 MB and AD = infinity. With those settings, a configurable node would function exactly as current nodes do.


Doing so would be trivial. If that's the reason you're ridiculing the whole idea, then I don't find such evaluation sincere.
I didn't find the answer to my question though, maybe I misunderstood your post: Is it not true that miners can make this change in the code and recompile themselves? What is preventing miners from doing so Today?

To be able to somewhat indicate what fiatleak claims to indicate, you'd have to be able to know the previous price the same bitcoin (or part of) was traded at. The fiat "entering" bitcoin would then be the difference in price of the same bitcoin changing hands (e.g. is a bitcoin was traded at $500 3 weeks ago, and the same bitcoin is now sold at $900, then you could say that $400 entered the bitcoin market. Still a bit of a stretch, but the with some imagination...)

The volume of trades to get to the correct price if everyone knows the info is lower than if only one big seller knows the info.

The outflow is not due to companies accepting BTC and insta-trading them for USD, however, it's due to people wanting to reduce their holding, and thus not re-buying what they spend.
And if no companies would accept BTC and insta-trade, then the incentive to keep bitcoin would diminish (the point you don't seem to address), and people would reduce their holding even more by selling on an exchange.

Well, here you're omitting *velocity* from your equation. If the velocity of bitcoin remains the same, then you're right, and bitcoin can only gain in price.

Edit: my reply was not towards the quoted section, but more general.
That is assuming a very optimistic scenario where Bitcoin practically replaces all functionality of fiat money, which would probably take a while.
What about the stages in between, where bitcoin might gain a lot of adoption in certain areas with high velocity? Then the price wouldn't necessarily be a good indicator of adoption at that stage.
In general, an increase in adoption will lead to an increase in price, but not always and certainly not always at the same rate. So people shouldn't shoot down bitcoin when the price isn't rising along with the adoption, and neither should they expect at all times that if they see increased adoption, that the price must naturally rise along with it. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 17:19:01
I'm sorry, but you're misreading the formulae in the link you gave.
P is not the 'price of the currency', it is the price level corresponding to the real outputs. P*Q is the total output (i.e. the total value of all transactions). If you doubt this, please re-read the article carefully, or try to find additional sources.
The price of the currency is part of the total money supply M, which you could re-write as:
*M = p x m*
*p* = price of currency
*m* = units of currency
resulting in the total equation of:
*p x m x V = P x Q*
For practical purposes, you should keep P*Q together as they represent the total output.
So in general, if the total output (P*Q) goes up (i.e. adoption increases and people use it more), then you can have this either by an increase of price of a unit of currency (small p), or an increase of the total units of currency (small m, this is pre-determined for Bitcoin) or by increasing velocity (V).
Theoretically, you could even have a larger total output combined with a decrease of price of the currency if the velocity went up more than the price declined.

I don't agree. A can-kick solution is inherently a small-effort solution (hence the name 'can-kick').

I'm sorry, but this is a poor argument.
The part of the price of gold determined by actual utility in industry is only a fraction of it's total value. If all demand besides industrial demand were to suddenly vanish, the price of gold would collapse. There's hardly any stability provided by this small part of the demand.
Stability is only provided when the majority of the demand is non-speculative and rather constant (such as other industrial resources than gold). But even for oil, there is no stability, since the production can vary wildly (just check the last year's oil price evolution).
Bottom line is that the examples you gave for stable commodities due to non-speculative value are rather poorly chosen. The price of bitcoin will likely become more stable as speculation decreases and usage increases.

I never argued that the goal was moved. Clearly the current BU proposal goes way beyond what was initially a simple proposal to bump to 2MB blocksize.
I argue against the notion that "the goalpost was moved" as if BU was a reaction to SegWit. Such claim is dishonest at best. BU was started beginning 2015 (its subreddit was created in May 2015) while the first mentions of SegWit date from end of 2015 (around the time of the Hong Kong scaling conference).
The reason for BU was the idea that most alternative proposals would just lead to the same debate at a later point, and it tries to come up with a solution to avoid such scenario's. You might disagree with this notion, or with how it's done, but there is no malice here, and there certainly was no "moving the goalpost as reaction to segwit".




Have you read about flextrans? A proposal that could bring similar advantages to bitcoin as segwit? There's more to the story than simply removing the blocksize limit. Core aren't the only ones working on ways to scale bitcoin, but for some reason, people keep thinking they have the sole claim to the truth.
Bottom line is, you're free to stand by what you believe in, and I encourage you to do so, but you should make sure to always keep looking for the complete story. Stay critical and don't take anything for granted.

Stealing would imply someone taking something that is not rightfully theirs.
When you engaged in the agreement to make the purchase that you ordered, you *agreed* to pay them $200 and they *agreed* to, in turn, return you XXX BTC. If the value of the amount of BTC agreed upon changes afterwards, the agreement made doesn't change!
You can, at most, be upset about them not delivering them at the moment of purchase, but then again, that also depends on what the terms of the agreement were. You were probably fully aware that there could be a delay on the transaction.
At the time of placing the order, they reserve an amount of BTC for it and they deliver it at the moment they receive your payment. This works both ways (price goes up or down), but that is *irrelevant*. What *is* relevant is that they are fulfilling their agreement.
Now stop crying because the price of bitcoin dropped after you bought.

I think you are painting an extreme image of what is actually going on.


People demand a small increase in blocksize to kick the can down the road to give headroom for scaling solutions. This request is supported by so many because it hardly impacts network costs and decentralization.
So don't pretend we are requesting infinite size blocks without regard for anything.


**No one** holds the "no matter what" idea. That's a nice narative to support your argument, but it's simply not true.


This is not happening to bitcoin. I see no pitchforks and I see no one storm any place. Unless, of course, you're speaking figuratively, but then the first part of your claim is wrong: when the power cuts out for no reason, or when internet stops / or is inexplicably expensive compared to competitors, then people definitely (figuratively) get their pitchforks to storm those service providers.
So the bottom line of my argument is that you should stop painting this extreme black and white picture of the situation.
@_date: 2016-03-08 18:19:44


An increase in demand for transaction space can be addressed by either reducing this demand (increasing fees) or by increasing supply. Literally *everyone* wants the second path of increased supply. The discussion is between whether to create some additional supply in the short term through a max blocksize increase to be followed by other improvements after, versus offering additional supply through segwit and LN (which would take a bit longer to materialize).
Try to start by understanding the view of those you are arguing against. You don't have to agree (it's a free world), but claiming others don't understand how fees work shows your lack of understanding of the debate.

It's not the same, though.
Someone selling bitcoins causes a pure negative pressure on the price.
Someone offering a service or good for bitcoins, after which bitcoins get converted immediately, has both a negative pressure on price (the selling part) *and* a positive pressure on price (demand for bitcoin going up due to being able to use it).
The actual net effect on the price remains just a guess for anyone, because it's as good as impossible to quantify the change in demand and the total amount of good sold.

"A contentious hardfork is contentious."
Thanks for stating the obvious. Maybe if Core had tried to compromise from the start in offering a can-kick max blocksize increase, then they would have had more time to look for a solution without the majority of the community worrying about it.
In stead, they chose to stall and delay everything so that according to their claims, we are still at a point where a hard-fork can't be performed within the next 12 months. If they are genuinely interested in performing a hard fork, then maybe they should have included something more substantial in their roadmap.

Well now it's not about the whitepaper, but how people coded and interpreted that vision? How about Satoshi himself that coded the 1mb and stated it can easily be removed at a later stage. If that doesn't indicate to you that the vision of the whitepaper was to not have this limit used as a fee-pressure mechanism, then I don't know what would.
There are arguments to be made for using a limit to create fee-pressure, but saying it was the vision from the start is far from reality.

Your interpretation is slightly off / incomplete, IMO. Here's the quote from the whitepaper:

He never stated that fees would/should rise, only that the incentive can transition entirely to fees. This can be accomplished in two ways:
* Rising fees (as you stated)
* **Increasing amount of transactions**
I believe that the second mechanism is far more important, and when strong enough, could even yield a larger total reward with decreasing individual fee amount.

You'll have to expand on this, because it doesn't make much sense IMO. I don't understand the logial step from potentially fewer nodes (unlikely with a small blocksize increase) to a centralized bitcoin under Coinbase control. It actually does sound like a bit of a stretch...


The current release of Classic doesn't include SegWit, but there is major support for the features SegWit brings. There is some debate around what the best approach is for including it, but it is highly unlikely that it would not eventually make it into a Classic release.

If you're going to use the rhetoric that it's in the white paper from the beginning, then let's also remember that the max blocksize was not in it from the beginning and was implemented as a temporary measure to protect from DoS attack vectors.
Obviously, the goal is to have a diminishing block reward compensated by an increase in price combined with an increase in total transaction fees. I don't see any implication in the white paper of increasing the per-fee value.

Right now you would be right. The question is if this will remain the same in a scenario where B U would become the majority of mining.
Additionally, if Chinese miners decide to go with B U, then I would assume they would do it only if the Chinese public was in favor of it as well (i.e. why change if you're the only one that desires to do so). Guess who were the drivers of the most recent price growth...

You're using practically the most expensive of all sorts of commercial  storage: SSD. Additionally, storage is becoming cheaper at a faster rate than the proposed blocksize scalings. Storage isn't the bottleneck.
Concerning the bandwidth: SegWit allows basically up to 4MB blocks (depending on which transactions are sent). While at first, it is likely that this will in reality be just under 2MB, it does allow for more bandwidth usage (similarly that a 2MB max blocksize increase will at first also not generate 2MB blocks all of a sudden).
Now don't get me wrong, I am in favor of SegWit as well, it brings many good things, but if you opposes 2MB blocks on the basis of bandwidth/storage, then you should be aware that SegWit isn't any better in that regard (and potentially worse).

Your argument is also "having your cake and eating it", as you put it.
SegWit increases the effective block-size, not the actual blocksize. 
SegWit in Core's approach would still have 1mb blocks, with an effective blocksize of about 1.75mb.
Equivalently, SegWit in Classis's approach would still only have 2mb blocks, with an effective blocksize that is higher. 
Claiming Classic would have 8mb blocks is incorrect and disingenuous, considering the main strength of SegWit (when used in argument to support Core) was that it leads to an effective increase in blocksize without increasing the actual blocksize.

A lot of things that exist in present day were deemed impossible at some point in history. Until you provide some sort of proof to substantiate your claim, I'll stick to acknowledging that currently, it looks unlikely.

No matter how you look at the issue, politics will always play a part in it. If we decide to require 'near absolute consensus', then politics will just as well allow people to prevent a change from happening.

This should be the key part of what you said.
We still have a growing number of transactions and a rapidly changing ecosystem, so we are far from a point where we can be at equilibrium. 
Let's keep bitcoin inclusive until we get to an equilibrium, where we can use the information learned along the way to make it work for everyone.
If we keep the 1mb limit, then we give up the opportunity to have total fee payout increased by having a larger number of transactions.

Considering that bitcoin strives to take out the middlemen, it is not unlikely to think the majority of the economic consensus is determined by the actual users.
In such a scenario, the difference between *one-man-one-vote* and *one-dollar-one-vote* becomes very small. The consensus by majority mechanism will then strongly resemble a democracy in which a vote is cast by running a certain client implementation.

Sigh... I didn't think I'd need to spell it out, but here goes:
Their webwallet is part of what draws users towards them, and is an important piece in their business model.
Those transactions on which they charge a fee (trades, etc.) all happen off-chain, so they are no stimulus for increased blocksize.
The point that it can be argued that they would benefit from increased use of their centralized webwallet (and thus from a limited blocksize) still stands.
For future reference, it's not because you add something in a discussion, that all of a sudden, a point sombody makes is refuted. To do that, you have to argue against the specific point, not just say "it's not completely technically as you said, so your point is invalid." That's not really how it works.

Even if he is against LN, how does increasing the blocksize secure people using his service? If anything, it allows for more transactions on-chain, leading to fewer on his centralized webwallet.
Additionally, increasing the blocksize to 2MB has no impact on LN. There will still be demand for payment channels and for the solutions that LN could bring.

That goes for both 'sides' of the debate. It can be argued that the support for Core appears a lot larger than it is due to initial censoring tactics etc.


Looking at the top developers to bitcoin, especially the most vocal ones (that probably influence the developers with a smaller contribution), it is quite clear that there is a disagreement on which path to take to move forward.
@_date: 2016-01-20 00:46:00


Your first argument was about the whitepaper and what was in it, the original vision.
Since that argument didn't hold, you've now changed to the total opposite of claiming the original whitepaper no longer holds.
Which one is it?


The protocol that was put in place 4 years ago never suggested to create some fee market. That happens to be a current side-effect of an anti DoS measure that was taken then.
Stop spinning things to suit your needs and contemplating about what would or would not have been intended in the past, try to argue based on merits.
My argument is that we don't need a fee market currently, since the block subsidy is still substantial. Delaying an introduction of a fee market allows the network to continue growing in a very inclusive manner. Likely, less fee pressure would be needed in a future where more transactions are allowed.
But I'm starting to repeat myself, and you keep changing direction, so I'm calling it quits here.

That happens to be *exactly* the point. People didn't know and didn't care because it was not relevant at the time. Furthermore, the soft-cap was increased multiple times through soft-fork, giving a strong indication that the intent was to continue doing so when required. That is the reason why people expect it to be lifted now, since its intent was just an anti DoS / anti-spam measure, not a fee-pressure mechanism.
If I (and others) had known at the beginning, I'm sure more people would have voiced their concerns and ideas about it.
Or are you implying that the goal of the 1mb cap was to create fee pressure from the beginning? If not the case, then it's quite irrelevant whether I knew about the cap or not, as that has no bearing on the social contract I signed up for.
@_date: 2016-01-29 17:20:25


You must be using a different Bitcoin than I am.
The one I use has a blockchain on which everyone that runs a node gets to decide on what types of blocks they accept as valid. The longest valid chain is what determines consensus. This consensus mechanism is fundamental to Bitcoin.
You should try reading the whitepaper.

Then you certainly must have seen the vote about keeping the 21 million cap, which is practically unanimous in favor of it.
Anyone can make nonsense argument: "*keeping the core governance model means that since few devs impose their views on the masses, they could raise the 21 millions cap and impose it on us*"

As I said in my previous post, it is sent around, but it is not time-crucial. It can be sent during the following 1 minute or so, and it should pose no issue (the reason is that nodes should generally already be aware of transactions and their proofs prior to receiving a block they are put in).
I'm not a SegWit expert, but that has been the explanation given by Core from the start, when it was initially proposed, so I see no reason to doubt that this is how it works.

We don't want bitcoin because it might lead to PayPal lowering their fees. We want bitcoin because it adds tremendous utility. Helping bitcoin adoption in any way *is* helping it to achieve that goal. More people using it, thus reducing the overall cost of value-transfer.
The selling point for bitcoin remains unchanged if PayPal would use bitcoin. What would happen is the addition of a selling point of *having the option* to use bitcoin in a known, probably less tech-knowledge required method for an aditional fee.
@_date: 2016-01-19 15:41:12
Agreed with practically everything you said.
Just one remark I'd like to add on the following:


I think it would be helpful if we made work of how to quantify decentralization. Everyone now seems to have his own idea about this and about what is acceptable. Finding a method of measuring this would simplify discussing what we think would be sufficient.
Additionally, I'm not convinced at all that the blocksize is the main factor driving miner centralization. We should also try to find what all factors are that drive miner centralization (and also other types of centralization). This would help us determine the previously mentioned quantification of decentralization, and this would help tremendously in finding ways to battle it.
These are topics that will hopefully receive further study.

$5 is also comparable to 1-2 days of work at minimum wage in India ([source]( Being able to do just 1 transaction for the cost of 1-2 days of work would very much be a 'force of oppression', to use your words.

I agree wholeheartedly with you that we can only come stronger out of this if we try to behave better towards people who don't share the same idea.
I also agree with you that the Core developers are very valuable to Bitcoin. They have done a tremendous amount of work, and I hope they will continue to do so.
The only issue I have at this moment is that I don't agree with the direction they have proposed. That doesn't take away that they are valuable to Bitcoin, and I hope that if a different path is chosen by the community, that the Core devs can reconcile with the new path to continue to provide valuable input.

I simplified the idea of "not arbitrarily constraining the amount of transactions and keeping the base bitcoin protocol layer as open and inclusive as possible (as also indicated by increasing the soft cap multiple time)" into the current practical meaning of increasing the 1mb max block limit.

How would reducing the number of influencers/voices (by fearing the creation of something resembling democracy) undermine bitcoin. What does he prefer?

To get this data, we can look at the average blocksize prior to the attack, which seems to be around 80% of the max blocksize. So that's likely closer to the actual number.
The argument made by remains the same.
@_date: 2016-01-19 10:49:53
We only need a "fee market" at the time bitcoin price stops growing at a factor of x2 every 4 years (concurrent with the halving rate of the block reward). If bitcoin is to become what we all hope (something that will know increasing major adoption), then that shouldn't be an issue in the short term.
So we should use this period to allow bitcoin to grow (according to technical constraints) in order to increase the total amount of transactions that will eventually be needed to generate fees.
There is no need to artificially constrain transaction right now to increase fees.

I read up a bit on SegWit and I think you're right. It seems that such complementary project is needed to turn SegWit into what I thought it would already do.
There is not necessarily an issue, though. All the benefits from SegWit can be included without creating a potential blocksize issue by altering the proposed way to count normal transactions and SegWit transactions.
So if we replace the proposed rule of
    base * 4 + segwit &lt;= 4,000,000 bytes
by an alternative such as the following:
    base * 2 + segwit &lt;= 4,000,000 bytes
Then the max blocksize for regular transactions remains the 2mb that Classic proposes, and the max blocksize if all transactions would become segwit will approximate 4mb (which is what the SegWit proposal under core would do).
Such modification would alleviate your concern of allowing 8mb blocks, would it not?
@_date: 2017-03-05 21:44:03


Everyone knows that Bitcoin is determined by what software users run. That means the users are in control of bitcoin, and also of the development of it. No matter what a developer codes, if users decide not to use it, then the developer is powerless.
Claiming people who propose an alternative bit of code want "control over the development" is totally misunderstanding the fundamental way that bitcoin works.

Transactions *are* primary. How you do it (on-blockchain or with layer-2 solutions) isn't. But as long as there are no layer-2 solutions, the protocol must be adapted to accommodate all additional traffic (sometimes with the cost of reducing other parameters). You can have as many nodes as you like, if no one uses it, then there is no value.
As stated before:

This is not really 'the opposite', this is rather in addition to. The practicality of the scenario you describe is larger with a higher threshold (i.e. it's harder to pull off with a lower threshold).
If you have 6% in a 95% threshold scenario, then you are almost guaranteed to be able to pull it off (since your 6% can effectively revert support and block the proposal after activating).
If you have 6% in a 75% scenario, reaching the threshold is likely to generate additional support, and increasing the likelihood that your 6% won't be able to change much (e.g. if support keeps rising to &gt;81%).
The other side of the coin is that if pulling off such scenario is successful, it would probably be more detrimental in a scenario with the 75% threshold due to creating a larger schism between miners (as opposed to only splitting of a small part when doing so in a 95% threshold scenario).
Edit: this is exactly the discussion we should have been holding since the beginning, to determine the up- and downsides of various thresholds.

Here's how I understand it (don't take my words too litteraly, it's possible that my understanding is not exact): 
A transaction exists out of tx data (inputs and outputs) and witness data (i.e. proofs, or signatures etc.).
Assuming that all transactions are broadcast prior to a block, it means that everyone should already have the tx data and the witness data.
This means when a block is created, the miner effectively only has to say which tx's he includes (he can decide to leave out some low-fee transactions, for example). He includes the tx data in the block that will form part of the blockchain, which is the history of transactions. The proof doesn't need to be stored in the blockchain, it only serves to show that the current transactions that are put in a block are actually valid.
For transactions that are eventually multiple blocks deep (e.g. 100 blocks), the proof is certainly not needed anymore, considering that the network basically validated that they are the valid history.
The only question that I currently still have is the following: how do transactions that are never broadcast (i.e. delivered directly to a miner) playing in to this?

@_date: 2016-01-19 10:59:30
You're misunderstanding SegWit slightly, I think.
The addition to a block is not part of the actual block, and is not a critical point when looking at propagation times, etc. The issue with an 8mb block is that propagation times regarding China (for example) can pose an issue. This would not be the case in a 2mb+6mb Segwit block. Only the relay of the 2mb actual block is time-crucial, the rest of the data can be spread out over a longer period.
So conclusions pose no opposition to 2mb block + SegWit.

That's a bit easy.
Try forming an argument in stead of just claiming I don't understand something.
If anything, you seem to not understand that the base premise of Bitcoin is to process transactions (maybe you should re-read the whitepaper?). Without this, it is worthless. If it wouldn't process transactions, it would mean it is either incapable of doing so or that no one is interested anymore. Both would be far more detrimental than the amount of nodes.

If a hardfork takes 12 months to perform, then not putting it in a more detailed manner on the roadmap worries me.
The same "a few months is too soon" anti-fork argument was also made 8 months ago, if they had added it to some roadmap at that time, we could have had a scheduled hard-fork in 4 months. 
Instead, the idea of a hard-fork was hand-waved aside just like Core and it's supporters are doing now. It just looks like a disingenuous stalling tactic.

Here's why I didn't care to provide substance, and why everyone was so curious to see your 'proof that Bitcoin can never scale on-chain':
* In his 1842 book The Positive Philosophy, the French philosopher Auguste Comte wrote of the stars: “We can never learn their internal constitution, nor, in regard to some of them, how heat is absorbed by their atmosphere.” In a similar vein, he said of the planets: “We can never know anything of their chemical or mineralogical structure; and, much less, that of organized beings living on their surface.”
* The number of scientists and engineers who confidently stated that heavier-than-air flight was impossible in the run-up to the Wright brothers’ flight is too large to count. Lord Kelvin is probably the best-known. In 1895 he stated that “heavier-than-air flying machines are impossible”, only to be proved definitively wrong just eight years later.
* On 29 December 1934, Albert Einstein was quoted in the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette as saying, “There is not the slightest indication that [nuclear energy] will ever be obtainable. It would mean that the atom would have to be shattered at will.” This followed the discovery that year by Enrico Fermi that if you bombard uranium with neutrons, the uranium atoms split up into lighter elements, releasing energy.
I could go on, but you will probably ignore it anyway with some hand-waving gesture.

The road to get where we are now on this subject has proven to have been very hard so far. If this BIP ends up being implemented and changed to, then that wouldn't invalidate the fact that changing fundamental rules of the system is hard.


Yes, because changing the 21 million would be just as "controversial" as changing from 1 mb max blocksize to 2 mb mx blocksize.
Ever heard of the slippery slope falacy?
@_date: 2016-01-21 14:51:41
Sure, but that argument goes both ways. I joined bitcoin with the social contract in mind of eventually removing the 1mb max block limit (before it is turned into a fee pressure mechanic). If a small group of devs can impose their will despite this social contract, then I will make my own conclusions.
Each is free to make his own conclusions and explain his ideas and fears, but stating them as fact and extrapolating extreme consequences from them serves no one. 
@_date: 2016-01-25 23:33:35


According to your concerns: isn't the current policy determined by core developers voting on github?
My answer: it's not, because in the end, it's consensus that determines the policy that is used. This surpasses whatever implementation is used. So worrying about which mechanism some group uses to find out what to implement is pointless.
@_date: 2016-01-19 10:39:13
I agree to some extent, but on the other hand I dread the idea of having to go through this each time the community ideas and those of Core are misaligned.
I prefer to have the community switch reference client, not to ostracize the Core devs, but to set a precedent that makes it clear that changing reference client is a viable path that can be taken again in the future if needed.
Of course, for contingency and safety of the network, it would be better to have a coordinated hard-fork.
@_date: 2016-03-10 09:30:56
@_date: 2016-01-19 13:32:20
There's two separate issues:
* The hard-fork question. Can it be done safely or not?
* The scaling solution: will 2mb blocks cause issues of decentralization, etc.
My stance on the first issue is that if we want to guarantee a long-term healthy development path for bitcoin, then for sure we will need to implement changes requiring a hard-fork eventually. In that regard, it's important to start looking for a process (which is open to debate) that would make the likelihood of success as high as possible. 
Core saying that even the idea of a hard-fork is out of the question doesn't really help this debate much. To me, it seems very unlikely that we will never need a hard fork, so might as well start the discussion about it now (especially based on Core claims that rolling out a hard-fork requires a long lead-time). 
I don't agree with the slippery slope argument. It has been demonstrated already that an effective blocksize increase can be performed via Soft-fork, even a max coin cap can be increased via special mechanics in a soft-fork. Furthermore, some rules are practically set in stone due to the social contract everyone basically signed up for when getting involved in Bitcoin.
My stance on the second issue (scaling solution) is that the only limit we should impose is one of technical limitation. It is unlikely that a moderate increase of the max blocksize would significantly affect nodes and miners.

I don't believe there are two different largest groups. There's the two small extreme groups, and then there's a third majority in the middle. People such as yourself and me, that want SegWit, that don't want a chain split / community split. There's only minor differences within this group concerning when and how to perform a hardfork to add features.
The thing that bothers me most is that if we want to add some hard fork wish list items to bitcoin, we really should have started planning a hard for 2 years ago. A lof of people (including Core developers) keep claiming 1 month, 3 months, 1 year (almost any timeframe) is too short for a hard fork. Well if that is so, then we should definitely start planning it now instead of postponing it.

The problem is that there are plenty of reasons to oppose SegWit as a softfork, and there's plenty of reasons to support ideas that go beyond a simple blocksize increase, but when you explain this to a proponent of SegWit, they say "but SegWit=bigger blocks, it's what you want."
Both 'sides' are guilty of sticking their heads in the sand. Everyone seems to be blind about other people's ideas, and if presented with an opinion that differs from one's own, the usual reply is "you're a sockpuppet troll".

@_date: 2017-08-11 09:12:32


The two most active groups are not the two largest groups though.
I personally never wanted a hard fork. I consider Bitcoin Cash an abomination and I find it hard to see a way in which it would help Bitcoin further.
I want SegWit and I want the SegWit chain to also have a larger max blocksize. A small portion might have split off from Bitcoin with their stupid hard fork, but I fear that the split (if it happens) with the 2x part of SegWit2x will likely be a larger divide.
For that reason, I advocate reconciliation rather than dividing Bitcoin even more. The whole narative of "standing up against oppressors" is lost on me. Bitcoin works *because* everyone follows his personal incentives, *not* despite of it.

Not only for soft forks, also for hardforks that are implemented with a threshold activation. The principle is exactly the same. The difference is what happens with non-upgraded clients, which doesn't change the fact that it's basically a hashing power weighted vote.
Concerning the "only miners get a vote", it's also important to note that while they cast the vote, the end power lies with the full nodes that can still chose to accept or reject blocks based on what they feel about the changes. This is again, exactly the same in both softfork and hardfork. In hardfork, a client can chose not to upgrade in order to reject the new changes. In softfork, a client could chose to reject the new types of blocks (by way of implementing another softfork to do so, if necessary).

The 95% threshold for SegWit activation is a very democracy-like feature (as it should be); it is a vote of hashing power for the acceptance (or rejection) of a newly proposed feature.
You can claim that Bitcoin in no way resembles a democracy, but that doesn't change the fact that proposed changes get accepted or rejected based on what is practically a hashing power weighed vote.

You know just as well as anyone that moving forward without miner support is a high-risk venture. It's not impossible, because users have the power to do so if needed, but it's very undesirable. That is the reason why miners also share in the power over consensus changes.
@_date: 2016-12-06 23:43:55
How can there be a "power grab" is Core is not in power (as they self proclaim).
Truth is there is no power grab, if another client were to become the new dominant client, there is no reason why at a later point, it couldn't shift back to the initial client (or to a third implementation).
It's all participants combined that are in power, as should be.
If anything, the fact that we have never seen a complete shift in dominant client / dev team would be an indicator that we are all just sheep, and Core is indeed in control. *That* would be a bad sign, but I still believe *we* are the ones in control (just haven't actually demonstrated it yet).

That's not the assumption.
The assumption is that not allowing for bigger blocks while no alternative exists yet stems growth. A slowed growth is the only logical result of not allowing for an increase in transactions per second.
The real discussion is about how to alleviate this issue.


Exactly, due to lack of alternatives, Bitcoin currently doesn't allow more transactions on the network, and thus currently growth is slowed.


While I'm in favor of 2nd layer tx systems, I don't agree they should be the only path taken. It would be interesting if you would share the reasons why you believe they're the only way to scale, rather than simply asserting it.

@_date: 2016-12-08 22:22:50
You're misunderstanding the way bitcoin works. Bitcoin is secure due to miners, thus claiming they play almost no part in the decision making process is a ridiculous statement.
If all users decide to implement a change and essentially fork the miners off the network, then have fun with your insecure chain. Changing pow doesn't mitigate the fact that suddenly, there's a lot less money being spent on proof of work, thus essentially your security is compromised.
The reality is that miners are not the sole deciders when changes are proposed because it's a combination of users and miners. Claiming miners don't even hold some power is just preposturous. The fact that different groups put effort into lobbying with miners is a clear indicator that they hold significant power.
@_date: 2015-08-11 20:54:00
The incentives for users and miners are mostly aligned.
Users want a more useful coin, which will likely be more valuable due to being more useful.
Miners also want a more valuable coin, so their incentive is to opt for a coin that will be more useful for users. It's not in their interest to vote for a coin that a majority of users doesn't stand behind.
It *is*, however, the miners that secure the coin, so it makes sense to let them vote for it, that way everyone has some guarantee that the coin stays secure while still picking an option that keeps bitcoin useful for everyone.

That is perfectly normal. The new wallet (with no funds in it) is totally independant from the original wallet (with funds in it). This test just serves to check whether it happens with any wallet, or only with the original wallet with funds in it.

To me, it's clear which side didn't want to work together to implement a blocksize increase to 2mb (which would pose no threat to mining centralization). If they didn't agree on the method or the timeframe, they could have made suggestions on how to approach it. Instead they decided not to even try to find a compromise, and look where we are now. It didn't happen, and people are unhappy. Good result? I think not.
I know where I'm placing the blame.

Arguing against a block size increase =/= saying that you're working out the details to implement it
@_date: 2015-08-13 13:54:23
Aren't miners able to impose a soft limit on the blocks they produce?
Shouldn't we let the so-called 'fee marked' decide on its own what the block limit should be?
The hard limit should be a technological limit, not an artificial limit. It's quite clear that the current state of network bandwidth can facilitate larger blocks, and it's far from given that decreasing number of nodes (or other measures of centralization) are caused by an increase in block size.
@_date: 2015-08-19 08:53:13
The technical part of your argument is what you should focus on. That's what matters. If the current state of bandwidth, etc. isn't sufficient to handle 8MB blocks, then provide some more insight in this.
Here's the part of your (and others) reasoning that doesn't make sense:


A rational miner will only include the transactions that add to his profit. If a transaction with a too low fee would result in a higher risk of his block being orphaned, and the fee doesn't outweigh the loss in case of being orphaned, then he won't include it.
This will naturally bring fees to a level where a miner stays profitable, without the need to artificially limit the supply. There is no need to artificially create a fee market... It already exists, and will always exist.

So that is why the Chinese miners (who, at the beginning of this whole debate, were considered to be a pain point when it comes to bandwith) are indicating being opposed of 8Mb blocks? Except they are *not*.
And that is also why the tests run by Gavin indicate that 8Mb blocks would be an issue? Except they did not.
I would like to see you (and other block-increase opponents) substantiate your claim.
@_date: 2015-08-23 09:54:52
The max block size is now 1MB, a minimum increase of this upper limit of 10% would yield a max block size limit of 1.1MB.
Such a mechanic can guarantee that there is  lower bound to how the max block size limit increases, as opposed to staying at a constant level of 1MB.
It seems, however, that this concept is too hard for you to grasp.

The problem is they have *not*. They are claiming that a higher blocks lead to dangerous increase of centralization, but this has not been substantiated.
On the other hand, the devs in favor of an increase have run tests and have shown that 8mb blocks would cause no issues on a technical level, and that current bandwith can handle it fine (confirmed by Chinese miners).

Aah, thanks for clarifying. I'm sure OP indeed meant the block size limit should be 1.61051, a number without units. The '10 percent annual growth' is totally unrelated to this previous number. This is not at all about a minimum increase in block size limit.

I think this reasoning is backwards.
Taxes are taken in something that is valuable. Initially, farmers had to hand over part of their harvest as a tax. The harvest didn't become valuable because it was being used as tax.
Later on, any entity imposing taxes does so using something that is already considered as valuable.
Similarly, USD (or other currencies) are demanded by governmens as taxes because they are valuable and form a relatively simpel means of collecting tax, not the other way around.
Companies and people using currencies value them in the first place because others value them, because they know others will accept them, not because they so happen to need them for taxes.

I don't even know where to begin with this...
You *do* engineer things for normal every day use, while taking into account worst case scenario when possible. That is literally how engineering works! If all engineering projects that have a theoretical "worst case scenario" that could break them (or in this case 'make a proposed improvement suboptimal') would have been scrapped, then we likely wouldn't have all the technology we have now.
Also, since your "worst case scenario" when talking about thin blocks is still at least as good as the current P2P scenario, then what is really the problem?
Furthermore, we can empirically determine that miners seem to participate in the relay network, so why are you assuming they wouldn't participate in a thin-blocks scheme due to animosity?
Lastly, even if they were to act 100% out of self-interest, reaching 51% of miners *quickly* (to ensure you don't have a stale block) by far outweighs the minor benefit of not reaching the remaining 49% of miners (or reaching them with a delay). This incentive would definitely make miners adopt propagation improvements.

It is indeed circular, but that is the nature of a currency: it has value because other people perceive it to have value. Money is only valuable because you know that other people find those pieces of paper in your wallet valuable.

If we actually look at some data to try to deduce what can cause miners to drop out, we can notice that the only drop in estimated network total hashrate ever happens to coincide with a steep drop in price of bitcoin, or in other words, due to a strong decrease in actual reward. It doesn't sound like an illogic conclusion to expect a lower reward will put downward pressure on miner count, due to lowering the total reward.
Also, did you miss the part where I says "all else equal"? Please give me 1 logical hypothetical reason why we would not see a decrease in miner count after a reward halving, *when all other factors remain equal*.
I will also stress again (even though you ignored it completely) that the actual point why we even started to debate, is that you don't care about miners not surviving, and thus you don't care about miner decentralization. Just shows that you don't argue from that point when trying to defend 1mb blocks.
@_date: 2016-02-16 22:35:17


The people that are against Classic are opposed to it not due to the 2mb max blocksize increase, but due to the method by which it wants to go through with a hard-fork.
With this in mind, in a scenario where enough miner support would be present to trigger the fork, the most likely scenario (IMO) would be to remove the contention (and possible ecosystem split) by incorporating the 2mb 'patch' into Core.
I understand people who oppose it at this stage, but if a fork were to be triggered, the best action would seem to be to go along with it, *considering the actual change itself is not the controversial part*.
I stressed that part, because this reasoning is only valid when it comes to a proposed change that is generally accepted on principle.
I hope I worded my reasoning clear enough, it's not always easy to put it in writing. In any case, thanks for your level-headed reply.

You stated you didn't care if miners survived the half points. When a lower block reward leads to fewer miners (as in "they don't survive a half point"), then that likely leads to increased centralization.
Anyone who cares about miner decentralization should care about miners surviving half points.

If there hadn't been such a strong voice supporting Classic, we most likely wouldn't have seen a counter-reaction from some Core members to provide the roadmap they have Today.

At least now we have a clear view on both the roadmap ideas *and* the timeline for it.

Not really. 
Samson is telling Brian that he should "run this fork" exclusively. As long as there isn't enough adoption, *there is no fork*. So his logic already breaks down at this point.
Additionally, Brian advocating that miners start running Classic is in hopes that enough of them do in order to adopt this fork. If not enough of them do, and the fork doesn't happen, then none of those miners lose anything. No one has to make an 'all-in' choice now. Another point where his logic doesn't really make sense.
So, yes, Samson's logic *is* wrong.

Each node will request a new block once. That means that on average, each node will transfer a block once (i.e. some nodes will transfer it to multiple peers, other nodes will never transfer it).
So that means that some (usually well-connected) nodes will have a bandwidth saving of only 12%, while other nodes can have a bandwidth saving of up to 50% (nodes that are not well connected and receive almost no requests to transmit a block).

Firstly, let me quote your words verbatim, as a reminder for which discussion we're having here:


If you state that you don't care about miners surviving something, then that carries the implication that you don't really care about miner centralization.
Secondly, on the topic of block reward and miner count: I doubt you will find *anyone* who will dispute that a reward halving (all else equal) creates a downward pressure on miner count.
That doesn't mean that a reward halving can't be offset by an increase of bitcoin price to yield an equal or larger effective block reward, but that's besides the point.

I'd say Brian is probably in a better position than you (considering his involvement in the ecosystem) to judge to which extent such people exist.
Additionally, who is to say there aren't early adopters with significant stakes in bitcoin that would pull out if the proposed roadmap by Core isn't aligned with their vision?
Both sides can basically make this same argument, which is a rather poor argument for either side. I suggest we stick to arguments about what we know.
@_date: 2016-02-19 14:24:33


But you were not talking about max load (which is still an average daily use scenario), you were talking about a worst case scenario in adversarial conditions. 
But don't bother to come up with a better analogy to defending your point. It's irrelevant, because the worst case scenario with thin blocks is still at least as good as the current propagation in the P2P network.
You're basically saying (to make a bridge analogy): "it's no use making cars smaller and lighter to accommodate more traffic on the bridge because the worst case scenario stays the same."
@_date: 2016-02-19 10:06:33

If enough transactions are done in Bitcoin, merchants who do accept it can pay less on transaction costs and thus receive a larger margin. 
The story doesn't end there, however. By way of competition between these merchants, prices will feel a downward pressure.
So in the short term, the merchants will benefit. Then, lagging a bit behind, prices can decrease. This will only happen if a large enough part of transactions are low-fee transactions.
@_date: 2017-09-27 20:56:46
I'm not mad about anything. Maybe you are projecting. I'm merely pointing out that the fees in 2012 were a lot different because there was no talk of a fee market as there is now.

You don't even realize that it is called an "effective blocksize" because it has the same effects as a blocksize increase.

Yes, correct, my mistake, I see now that I mis-explained what I wanted to say. There's basically 2 effects of a spam-attack:
- Filling up blocks to increase load on the network (bandwidth, storage, memory) - The point you correctly corrected that this gets worse with larger blocks
- Increasing minimum fee of transactions in order to congest the network in order for normal transactions to become stuck / delayed - This gets better with larger blocks
I wanted to say (and I corrected it now in my original reply) that obtaining the second effect with a spam attack becomes more expensive with larger blocks. That is the thing that a BCH proponent would be pointing at, as he wouldn't consider the first effect an issue.
[Explanation for those interested - At any given time, there is a certain demand for transactions, and a given supply of transaction space. Let's simplify things and assume there is a demand for 5 transactions, at respective fees of 1, 1, 1, 2, 3 sat/byte.
Then assume a blocksize that can hold 5 transactions: without an attack, all transactions go through. To attack this system, you can create 5 transactions with fee 4 sat/ byte to price out all 5 transactions, for a total cost of 20 sat/byte.
Now assume a blocksize that can hold 10 transactions. In such case, an attacker would need to make 10 transactions at 4 sat/byte to price out all other transactions, for a total cost of 40 sat/byte.]

While I agree with this premise, I'll explain why I disagree with the current strategy of trying to make a fee market happen asap: the actual value of the block reward is practically higher than ever (despite 2 times halving of the reward). The halving schedule is relatively slow, meaning there is plenty of time to keep fees low while we have a substantial miner subsidy. Promoting high fees right now, while a Layer 2 system is not usable yet, sounds to me like placing the cart before the horse.

It certainly can ([here]( a chart of the average blocktime with a moving average of 90 days). Disregarding the very early days, we see that it hovers around 10 minutes, generally being lower than 10 minutes. Even with a moving average of 90 days, which is about 6 difficulty retargets, it has still dipped significantly under 10 minutes at times when miners added a lot of hashing power in a short period.
@_date: 2017-10-26 06:52:58
That's basically how it works, except that difficulty isn't changed after each block, it is only changed every 2016 blocks. So each 2016 blocks, it looks at the average time for those blocks, then retargets in order to be able to expect a block every 10 minutes.

Thanks for finally elaborating.


You're explaining exactly my point.
You can make rules for yourself, you can approach it in different ways to try and track transactions. On a technical level, however, coins don't have a history.
Some situations are clear (if there has been no consolidation of multiple utxo), but more often than not, there's no way to tell. And that answers OPs question: there's (usually) no way to tell how old your coins are or in which block they were mined, because you can usually 'trace' them back to different blocks, depending on which arbitrary set of rules you follow.

You're arguing against your own point.
You claim the analogy breaks down cause Bitcoin doesn't hold any benefits over current methods, yet then you indicate that for email, the benefits weren't very clear when it was first introduced.
The same could be true for Bitcoin, it still has potential to bring more to the table that is unclear for us at the moment.
Only time will tell if Bitcoin will be a change as big as email, it doesn't make much sense to claim it will not. At the moment, it could still be, and that's the potential that leads people to invest in it (they don't usually invest for the sake of investing).
@_date: 2017-10-03 07:03:36
The analogy falls flat because hugoland was responding to the point being about control. So your analogy reads:
*Coinjaf: "We're protecting our house against a group that wants to take control."*
*Hugoland: "If that were true, you could have implemented the 2mb to keep control and pulled the rug out from the would-be overtakers' feet!"*
This logic approach (if the issue would really not be with the 2mb, as coinjaf posed) stands in contrast to the absurd measure of burning your house down to protect against someone else burning your house down. So your analogy doesn't properly convey the conversation between Coinjaf and Hugoland.
The point being that hugoland is correct in pointing out that the issue isn't about control. It's about the belief that a hardfork would be an unnecessary risk to take in such short timeframe.
All the people being afraid about some takeover or companies seezing control don't understand that bitcoin is defined by its users. If the s2x hardfork happens and is fails, it will be because users aren't onboard. Equally, if it succeeds, it will be because users approve of it.
@_date: 2017-10-03 20:47:26
Again, you are still missing the point that coinjaf said that the flammable materials are not the issue (to continue in your analogy).
Then you also missed that someone replied to him with a conditional statement "if the burnable materials aren't the issue, then..."

You can do this, or you could just as well use any other arbitrary rule.
The bottom line stays that this is all meaningless on a technical level and that coins don't have an absolute history, which has been my point from the start.
(And I don't understand why this is such a controversial topic... the technology is what it is, it works the way it does. This shouldn't even be up for debate. You could have said 'no there is no absolute history, but there exist various methods of trying to track bitcoins back to their origin, using various set of arbitrary rules')

Add a few more steps of transaction history, and there are no meaningful conclusions to be made and no 'age' of their coins to deduce.

There definitely *is* a potential benefit for banks. They can leverage bitcoin as their settling mechanism to reduce friction and cost of managing normal Fiat transactions done by their customers.


This isn't completely correct IMO. It has been designed to put 'the people' back in control of the monetary system, instead of just a select group such as banks.
It lets people bypass banks if they desire, but banks or bank-like entities can still provide valuable services. They can no longer control the system, though.

It's as the top commenter in this thread says: bitcoins are like water or gold, you merge them together and there's no meaningful way of splitting them.
You can somewhat 'track bitcoins' by looking for patterns (e.g. if a very specific amount of bitcoins is put through a mixer, and you find a new output somewhere of this same amount, it is very likely that it belongs to the same person). But such methods aren't to be confused by thinking there is some sort of history to a coin. There is no 1-to-1 relation between new and old bitcoins on the newtwork.

Your math checks out, but the logic where you start out from is inherently flawed.
If A gives you 5 $1 bills, and B gives you 5 $1 bills, and then you proceed to give $5 to person C, you could use all bills received from A, or all bills from B, or you could split it 50/50.
With fiat, there is a way to determine what the history of the notes is, since they have serial numbers. With bitcoin, however, there is no way to determine any absolute history, because you can't tell whether the BTC you received originated from A or from B.
Is logic really that hard for you?

Person A has an unspent tx of 5 BTC, person B has a similar unspent tx of 5 BTC. They both send their tx to person C, who now holds 10 BTC. Person C then sends 10 BTC to person D.

@_date: 2015-04-20 07:55:51

Person D then sends 5 BTC to person E and 5 BTC to person F.

Yes they are, for small amounts.

The discussion you were having about intrinsic value is more about semantics.
What you mean with intrinsic value is value derived from intrinsic properties. In a literal sense, obviously an object can't actually hold an intrinsic value. It's a pointless debate when you both mean different things.
The real point is that claiming bitcoin doesn't have intrinsic properties (and thus intrinsic value according to your interpretation) because it's not something physical is wrong.
The intrinsic property is you can send it around on a distributed network. This is what gives it value.
Is this value correct, given the functionality it currently has? Maybe not.
Is the value of gold correct, given its functionality (in electonics)? Definitely not.

Lotteries are successful because for a low priced entry, you stand to gain a large multiple.
If someone could chose between two lottery tickets that each cost $1, the first ticket has 50% chance of winning $1, the other ticket has 1% chance of winning $100, then most people would chose the second ticket. You don't play to win a dollar, you play to win a substantial amount.
So the 'big smart players' will often win a little bit relative to their total entry, but they are the ones creating a huge pot. Some of the times they will lose, and someone else stand to win a high multiple for a low entry fee, which is exactly how a lottery works.
For a regular player, it doesn't matter if the pot is funded by a large number of other small-ball players or if it's funded by 1 player with a huge entry.

Current bandwidth constraints are determined not by the total bandwidth required (i.e. 1 MB every 10 minutes), but by the bandwidth required to propagate a block (i.e. 1 MB in a few seconds).
The proposed solution would shift the constraint from scenario 2 (how to propagate a block as quickly as possible) to scenario 1 (the bandwidth would be more equally spread over the block interval).
So while the total bandwidth would be about the same (or slightly more due to added overhead), the peak bandwidth requirement would go down.

Not quite. There is empirical data that suggests the changes of the last few years make most users not run full nodes. This is likely mostly due to SPV wallets rendering the reference client not needed for most users. This was the case long before we approached the 1MB limit. Hard to verify actual causalities, but I doubt the 1MB limit we're approaching is playing a big role in the diminished node numbers.


A few days of testing might not be enough to make final conclusions, but they are a strong argument against the thought that 8MB blocks would be an issue when it comes down to bandwidth/processing of blocks.


This is IMO the only argument that has some merit. Something to reflect on, however: the relevant point is not whether this 41% is above/under predicted bandwidth growth, but if the actual max block size would ever exceed a level that is manageable by enough nodes.


Considering we're bumping into the 1MB limit frequently already, that even LN would require a larger blocksize than 1MB, and that (hopefully) more people get interested and start using bitcoin, I don't agree at all with your last statement.

I got that point.
As for chain bloat, that remains the same. This new idea doesn't solve that, as the total information to be stored would remain the same.
Concerning bandwidth, there *is* a difference. Currently, large blocks are an issue due to the risk of being orphaned during the time it takes to transmit it. They need a certain bandwidth just to be able to transmit a block as fast as possible, for the rest of the 10 minutes the bandwidth is not completely used. This would no longer be an issue, since the key block (the one that yields the block reward) doesn't increase with higher tx rates. You can have a lower bandwidth that is constantly used, leading to the same total data transmitted.

The key blocks are constant size, and thus pose no increased risk of orphanage when tx rates increase.
Microblocks are created continuously, which means the tx rate can increase significantly. For an equal tx rate, in stead of needing to process 1 big block every 10 minutes, now you would need to process multiple smaller blocks during this 10 minutes. Additionally, larger 'microblocks' would not result in an increase in orphaned blocks.
It doesn't solve all problems (e.g. you would still need to keep all tx's in mempool), but it does tackle bandwidth and orphan rate, which seem to be the major concern for nodes that have a limited connection.

That doesn't mean that no other technology can bring anything of value or that it is per definition worse (it isn't), but it does mean that jumping ship has a low likelihood due to where bitcoin already stands.

Why should simply locking bitcoins (or any money) generate interest?
Interest is generated by using money to make more money, not by stashing it somewhere.
Edit: to clarify, "using money to make more money" means producing goods or a service (requires money) in order to turn a profit (make more money than you initially had). That is the source of interest: value creation.

Bridges *are* designed based on compromise: you make a compromise between the cost of building and the number of lanes you put on it. You make compromises when determining where to build it. Etc. 
Aircrafts *are* designed based on compromises: higher top speed means higher cost. Larger aircraft carries more people but has a higher operational cost. Etc.
Why would we build a global currency protocol based on compromises? Because there are multiple roads to the same end-goal. Each road has it's benefits and downsides that are poorly captured in solely technical speak.

I'm not thinking Bitcoin is the best now, and that's probably also not what others are thinking, most do think that the small improvements over bitcoin will likely be too small to warrant jumping ship rather than incorporating them into bitcoin.

The end user will generally not care about how exactly he can use bitcoin. He'll care about where he can use it, how easy it is to use, and what the bottom line cost of using it is. 
For those reasons, I advocate an increased blocksize to allow this problem to be tackled from multiple angles,rather than putting all eggs in one basket. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 08:18:34
What is stopping miners from mining bigger blocks today, other than the fact that nodes would reject larger blocks? It isn't the software, for sure, as they can quite easily modify it themselves.
If there were EC, then that would serve only as a coordination mechanism on the network. It wouldn't really give any more power to miners than they have today.
The bottom line is that nodes determine what the blocksize is by accepting or rejecting blocks. EC doesn't change this.

While I find the idea behind it solid, reality is that User Activated anything is easily susceptible to sybil attacks, and therefore it stands in direct opposition to the goal of Bitcoin.

Theymos is not anti-censorship, he imposes it both here and on bitcointalk.org, which is bad. I'm not sure what you were trying to ask here...


Again, what? You don't 'keep consensus' by censoring the debate. Consensus is kept by having a debate and finding a conclusion that is somewhat satisfactory to all.
Censoring a debate can create the illusion of consensus, as in "yeah, there's consensus cause everyone agrees". Easy if the ones not agreeing don't have the right to speak.


And again, what? There were plenty of discussion in which a part (with plenty of support) was practically actively ignored, rather than carrying on the debate. There were faults made at both sides of the discussion, but saying "Some refused to participate in that" is blatantly wrong.
It's only now that just 1 developer (Mike) seems to have given up on participating in some IRL discussions because he stopped believing they would be useful. I don't completely agree with him on this, and would prefer him to keep participating, but all of the things you mention happened way before Mike got this feeling.

That's a statement that can only be made after the fact. At first, do you think everyone thought the benefits of email were so abundantly enormous? Sending a message practically instantly was not new, people could fax it just as well, they said.
Your argument is very similar, and that's normal. The benefits don't *appear* to be very significant, but that doesn't mean it will remain that way. 
I'm convinced the benefits will be enormous as well, given time to build additional services on top of it, and to integrate it more into existing systems.

Considering all the alt-coins that have come and gone, I think you're overestimating the likelihood of everyone jumping ship to a 'better coin'.
A new coin must not simply be better (that won't suffice), it must be *significantly* better in order for the improvements to outweigh the downside of having to move over to a different coin.
And if the difference isn't large enough, then the things making the new coin better could just be implemented in bitcoin.

Do some research? I've been in this subreddit the whole time this thing unwinded. Maybe you should do some research and have a look at how things went down and what actions have been taken.
You simply claiming Theymos isn't censoring because he didn't ban scammers and because he once said he doesn't censor really doesn't mean much when faced with the decisions he has taken here.


I thought I made it clear that my stance on the censoring and my stance on the ideas are not influenced by each other.


This is really stretching it. It certainly happened, but it was no different than any other temporary hype of something eventful happening.


So to avoid seeing/hearing what the community thinks and votes for (hey, isn't that how reddit is supposed to work?), it's better to have 1 person start blanket banning/deleting everything that has to do with something he doesn't like?

It's more likely that the 0.02% is rounded down value not showing trailing numbers.
The simplest is:
    N x (Profit per bitcoin) = $5.16
    N x ($543.64 - $543.52) = $5.16
    N = $5.16 / $0.12
    N = 43
Calculating the ROI with this value yields:
    $5.16 / (43 x $543.52) = 0.022078% ≈ 0.02%
Which confirms the assumption that the 0.02 is probably rounded down. This indicates that 43 bitcoins is more likely than 47.46 bitcoins.

I had a good chuckle at this claim.


No it's not... Moderation is removing people that don't abide by the rules. Removing scammers is a perfectly acceptable example of moderation. Implementing new rules to stifle one side of a debate is *not* moderation, it is definitely censoring.


I haven't seen any pushing. All I saw was a "well, here is my solution, because I don't believe we'll find a compromise, take it if you like it, leave it if you don't".
You can only wait for so long to come to a conclusion before just letting people decide. Waiting indefinitely to come to a consensus would be detrimental for making progress. I could understand if you'd believe he jumped the gun and didn't give enough time to continue the debate, but claiming he's pushing something to people is just not correct.


I already said I didn't really agree with Hearn not participating in the workshops etc. (I understand some of his frustrations, but not participating isn't going to achieve much).

As for the weight of contributions, it's easy to argue that a few earlier commits carry a lot more weight in the success of bitcoin than a long list of commits late into the project.
Too bad you missed to boat a bit on bitcoin. You've contributed quite well, but all in all, your contributions don't mean much when compared to hal finney and other's early contributions.
As much as you like to, there's really no need to pretend you are the big shot in bitcoin. You are not.

Your hindsight is indeed 20/20. Of course *now* the upsides are crystal clear. Not so much when it just got invented (as I already stated): many people were saying those inventions were pointless, since they had horses and they had fax.


Would you rather I repeat myself with predictable points you heard before and which you apparently find insufficient upsides? I won't change you staying oblivious to the fact that your reaction towards bitcoin now is quite similar to people's reactions to other inventions earlier.
Now don't get me wrong, I'm not saying bitcoin is a done deal, it still needs to prove itself (or continue to prove itself), and things still need to be built and expanded on top of it, in order for it to manifest it's upsides.
The difference is I see moderate benefits and much potential (which might not substantiate), and you see nothing, just as most people saw no improvement in email until after it substantiated. That's all fine, and there are probably multiple inventions where most people saw no potential, and where not much came of it. No need to get heated due to a difference in opinion.
@_date: 2015-03-05 11:42:15
They're not meant to be condescending. They're just the most clear examples from technologies where the benefits and the impact it would bring were far from obvious at the beginning.
At the same time, staying realistic, there are probably a dozen inventions that showed potential but didn't make it.
My point is it's easy to ask "*of what use is this to me, or to anyone?*" but one has to recognize that this same question can be posed of any new technology that isn't completely proven yet. I rather discuss about shortcomings or issues instead of answering this contrived question, hence my response to show the question doesn't bring much new to the discussion.

@_date: 2017-05-12 13:22:09
So, let me continue on these two statements (which you put in bold for their importance)


 


I agree with these statements. That is **exactly** the point that I'm making.
Let's say everyone switches to EC, but (as I explained before) configures their nodes to accept only block sizes that the community has deemed safe for the network, **then there is no difference with the current situation**.
So EC itself is not responsible for the fears you have.
You can advocate against a blocksize increase, which could have effects on node count, but that's not the topic I'm arguing about.
Claiming, however, that EC gives power to miners is **wrong**, the power is (and always will be) in the hands of the whole network. **All nodes accepting or rejecting blocks is what determines the consensus.**
@_date: 2015-11-24 16:15:46


The max blocksize should be set to allow for transaction peaks. It's perfectly fine if for the majority of the time it's not filled.
As for the subsidy-vs-fees argument: if the cost of the increased orphan risk by adding a transaction is higher than the fee gained from it, then a miner won't include it. There is no need for a blocksize limit to create a 'fee market'.
Maybe an increase to 2MB in the next year would be enough for now, and maybe a more conservative increase schedule would suffice. I just hope we get to see additional client implementations so that we can test multiple setups to make a choice.
@_date: 2015-10-01 12:27:57


I agree with this sentiment, but I don't agree that blanket banning / deleting almost everything and anything related to XT was the a good solution. It alienated an equally valid part of the community. 
A good solution would have been to use the methods and tools already in place such as deleting comments for going too much off-topic in a discussion and preventing duplicate posts about a topic to get through. If that would prove to be too much effort (not unlikely), something such as a daily discussion thread about blocksize to concentrate this part of the content could have worked as well. Many more options would probably have worked without exiling so many people.


It depends a bit on how you'd define quality. Some aspects have improved, but I can't really see much positive in not hearing all sides of the topic.

Correct, that's all we can say with certainty from the information we have.
With high likelihood, though, we can assume it's 43 btc, due to the order of the values in the spreadsheet (values to the right generally use those to the left in their formulas due to the way we populate cells from left to right). 
So ignoring the percentage, we can make the calculation I did above to come to this number of 43 btc.
@_date: 2015-02-24 12:52:08
Ok, I see what you're saying now, but your initial analogy only serves to confuse (due to the very different incentives between miners and the us gov). You should have just said why you believe it will not affect the value of bitcoin (as you did now), and leave out the analogy IMO.
Secondly, the miners can't change just anything about the protocol, not without the users agreeing with the change. There are different levels of protocol change that require different sets of participants to agree.
As for the rest, you're correct. If the majority of users (and not only miners) either want a proposed change or at least don't oppose it, then the value of bitcoin will hardly be affected. But if 95% of miners want a change which is opposed by the majority of users, then such a change would definitely have negative consequences for the miners.
End result: bitcoin would function as intended, the majority of all participants (again, not just miners) determines the taken path.
@_date: 2017-07-04 06:17:53
I have the same experience as yours, based on talking with real people in the real world.
@_date: 2015-02-24 14:03:23


So if miners change the protocol, that wouldn't be fatal, but if others do, it would? You have to pick a stance here.
Who created a block can be seen, and if that entity of group consistently orphans perfectly valid blocks and replaces them with blocks with less transactions, then it can be pretty clear that this is a bad actor.
Any node that doesn't comply with the new miners protocol change can verify for themselves if the transactions they create are consistently not present in blocks that are orphaning blocks where their transaction was present.
So even though I agree a mining entity or group holding 51% or more of the network would be bad, it's not due to the reasons you believe. They can't just go ahead and change the protocol to their liking if the majority of also non-miner users don't agree.
It's quite simple, if the majority of users decide not to use a certain protocol fork, then it doesn't matter at all how much hashing power would support it. It's the users who determine where the value is at (by buying, selling, using and trading bitcoin), no matter how you look at it.
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:07:45
In the current system, the rich invest their money so that it grows about equal with the market growth. So they get richer by not really doing anything but making their money available. Their value increases about proportionally with global growth.
In a system around bitcoin, if the rich just sit on their money, then there are no investments, and there would be no global growth in the economy. If they are to become wealthier from their money, they need to invest it in order to gain from a growing economy.
I see no difference except for a modified mechanism.
@_date: 2017-07-11 08:10:44
Except that the transaction is 1mb in size, it's under the sigop limit, yet it's too large for a regular 1mb block (due to overhead being part of a block).
This transaction would be perfectly valid to create the hard-forking block.

Yeah, sorry about those parts in my last comments. I got side-tracked a bit there. I had the attack mechanism correct in my head initially, but then jumped on a part of your post without keeping the mechanism in the back of my head.
So, here's a few remarks, back on track.
Lets consider your scenario with 3 branches. The attackers would need significantly more hashing power than 51%, because they need more than the existing 'good' miners to attack the old chain, and then still have enough mining power to secure the new chain (which could otherwise be attacked by a part of the old chain), leading to a game of back-and-forth, definitely destroying value.
Next, in your scenario, users basically get the option between joining the new chain which requires them to change their client (a protocol change) or remain with the old chain which will be rendered practically useless by the attack. Considering that switching to the new chain requires a protocol change, they could just as well perform a protocol change to fend off the attacking miners, if they decide they don't want to join the new chain.
If the majority of the users decide this, then the new miner chain will be useless because no users use it (it only gets mined), and a new user-determined chain will take off with whatever measure to fend off the attacking miners (this could, as an extreme example, be a modification in hashing algorithm, or using different hashing algorithms for alternating blocks, or as a less extreme example, have changed block acceptance rules)

The outset of the debate, however, is that they change the mining reward, which isn't playing according to the protocol at all.


The 'unknown' are unknown in the sense that their IP addresses aren't matched to an entity such as a mining pool. By recurrence, it is possible to see when someone is repeatedly 'breaking the rules' that users would set for accepting blocks.
Additionally, there are other strategies that could be used, in varying degree of protocol change agreed upon by users in order to block out bad actors trying to force people to adopt a protocol change that is not supported by users.

Since we're still at 1mb blocks, I think it's safe to state that the miners don't have any of the power you're talking about. If they did, for sure they would already have moved to larger blocks.
Reality is that the network holds the power.
Implementing SegWit or hardforking to Emergent Consensus doesn't change anything to who is in power, as it always will be the nodes and the community that runs them.

Well, even without the bounty transaction, it doesn't take much longer than 10-20 minutes for the network to naturally create &gt;1mb of transactions.
The worst case scenario on main-net would be that at the hardfork point, the 2x chain would stall for 10-20 minutes to wait for enough transactions to create a block larger than 1mb.
So activation doesn't hinge on anything.
What happened is more of a failure of testnet due to the way it operates. I prefer they spend their time on important things rather than on pre-conceiving ways that testnet could fail that aren't possible on mainnet.
Core developers calling this a massive failure of the SegWit2x devs is intelectually dishonest.

They have about 18 days to make sure the SegWit activation has no issues.

(I deliberately won't go into the specifics of SegWit2x development, as they are irrelevant for the point I'm making)


To me, the permissionlessness of Bitcoin doesn't depend on how one of the clients is managed. The permissionlessness comes from the fact that anyone can modify an open source client, use a different client, or generally run whatever software he wants. Consensus is formed by what all participants run.
If open source code is provided alongside a client, it means anyone can build on top of it, expand it, change it, etc. This is permissionless.
Let's say a hypothetical Bitcoin_Z client is made in a closed development fashion, but when complete, it is provided including the source code. If then, due to having features everyone wants, it's adopted as the new reference client, then nothing is stopping BitcoinCore developers to create a BitcoinCore2 client that is build starting from Bitcoin_Z. And no one can really stop people from running this new better BitcoinCore2 client. This is what permissionless means, and this is why all the FUD about who is or is not in control of bitcoin is meaningless. Bitcoin is in control of everyone who participates in it, and no one needs permission to add innovation. You only need to convince the rest of the participants.

@_date: 2017-07-11 08:07:43


Except that no testnet5 miner was mining with default settings.
The real reason was that there were not enough transactions in the mempool, which is something that won't happen on mainnet, due to the existence of the bounty transaction that is itself 1mb in size.
@_date: 2015-02-10 15:34:04
Agreed with you here.
But how it would actually play out is anyone's guess though, considering the complexity of the situation and the amount of different actors with varying goals.
Additionally, whether someone chooses between a low risk-free return or a higher return with a certain degree of risk will depend on the risk-aversion of that person. These options are available in both systems. Higher gains are associated with higher risks, and I see no compelling reason why suddenly everyone would decide to go exclusively for the low-risk option, when currently, that isn't the case either.
People claiming a deflationary currency doesn't allow an expanding economy also fail to note that this would still be possible with an increase of velocity rather than an increase of the monetary base.
Now I'm not claiming a deflationary currency is perfect and will fix all worlds' problems, I'm just not convinced the supposed doom-scenarios would play out like all opponents claim.

It's more like a trainstation with trains. (Appologies for the wall of text, I tried to keep it short, but it's not as simple to explain in layman's terms)
Mainnet (current real bitcoin) is like a busy train station. There's 1 big locomotive pulling all wagons. These wagons are designed to carry 1000 passengers each, and a new one is added to the train about every 10 minutes.
Now some people want to increase the wagons to double the size some time in the future (about 6000 wagons down the train), to be able to carry 2000 people. For this, some changes need to be made to the locomotive. A smaller train station has been created to test a couple of things, but since it's only a test station, only a small group of people involved in the testing gets on the train. To ensure no confusion between the unmodified locomotive and the modified one, at the specified wagon number, a wagon needs to be added that carries over 1000 people. If a larger wagon was added with fewer than 1000 people, no one would be able to distinguish it from a smaller wagon.
What happened is that someone went to the test train station and brought 6000 wagons. Now the new wagon should become a larger one, but since this is a test station, there are not enough people to fill the wagon to more than 1000. It was unforeseen and not planned for because this test was expected to be performed some other day. Nothing crashed however, and as soon as someone went to find more people, everything continued as expected. Additionally, when performed in the real train station, the 'issue' would not arise because there are, at all times, enough passengers to fill the wagon to above 1000 passengers.

Not really. Of course this is one of the reasons, but far from "mainly".
It mainly is more valuable than other decentralized blockchains due to first mover advantage, Many people haven't even heard about bitcoin yet, let alone some obscure altcoins. The reason why bitcoin is valued so high is because it is eventually the first thing people learn about.
It's immutability is important, but many other coins share similar immutability.

@_date: 2015-11-13 12:25:17
I think no one will disagree with that. What people disagree about is the effects certain changes would have.
Lets assume that an increase in blocksize would lead to a lower percentage of full nodes among participants, but an increase in total participants, then it could very well be that the end result would be more nodes in absolute terms.
Then there's also disagreement about what constitutes 'decentralization', how should it be measured? Is decentralization increased by having more nodes in absolute terms, or should we strive to have more nodes in relative terms? Or maybe the geographical distribution of full nodes is equally important.
Without empirical evidence, it's all just hypotheses, and blank statements like yours are applicable to all sides of the discussion.

It's really hard to estimate the total amount of users. Equally important is to make clear what you would understand as user. For example, why would someone holding just 1 bitcoin be excluded from the users, what about 0.1 bitcoin? How often does one need to 'use' some bitcoins (and how many) in order to qualify?
Without determining this, there's really not much of a point.
For example, if the 200k-400k figure would be the number of people who came in touch with any amount of bitcoin in some way, then that number would seem rather small. If the same figure would be the amount of users who make use of at least 0.5 bitcoin on a monthly basis, then that number would seem quite large.
@_date: 2017-07-11 11:34:57


I agree completely, and it is indeed a problem. Sadly, it's a problem for any change we might decide to make to bitcoin, be it by hard or by soft fork.


I'm not up-to-date with what is or is not currently being tested, but currently, the things to test should be mostly concerning the SegWit activation and general stability to ensure that the first step goes smoothly. After SegWit activation, there is still 3 months of time to do additional testing concerning the hardfork activation.


While I agree that the timeframe is quite short, and I understand the concerns relating to testing on such a tight deadline, this current event shouldn't change anyone's evaluation in a significant way. If anything, it demonstrated that nothing came crashing down.

Not quite right, though. A change in block reward would cause a hard fork. All nodes would reject any block created with a reward that is not compatible with what they expect.

@_date: 2017-07-12 06:36:44


What I'd like to hear is which measure is used to quantify decentralization, and how much of this measure is enough to consider the system decentralized enough.
Simply claiming that any loss of decentralization is disastrous is false. It's (just as with all things in life) a trade-off. A slight reduction in decentralization can lead to an increase in utility. So rather than making blanket statements, we should be looking into determining some 'state of decentralization', and then determine what is sufficient.

Bitcoin is fundamentally different than fiat, but not in this way.

The reason why this wouldn't work is quite simple. Nodes could quite easily ignore any blocks from the 51% majority as soon as they notice they are orphaning blocks on purpose.
So again, it comes down to consent between the majority of all users. If the majority of users don't want to yield to the miners, then the miners will just be left mining their own fork of bitcoin which no one uses, and there wouldn't be a thing they could do about it.
If the majority of users agrees to the change, then the miners wouldn't need to use any special tactics.
There are a lot of myths going around about what power someone actually has with 51% mining power, but it's not as much as often portrayed.

I've enjoyed this discussion, but I'm afraid we can go on indefinitely. So here are a few last remarks.
I won't continue on my first point much more cause that was only to show that 51% would not be enough in a situation where there would be no alternative (which I believe there is). So I'll just continue on this alternative.
The "Red Button Solution" is not the solution I proposed. A solution could be to implement mining as follows: the new hashing algorithm would only be applicable to every *other* block, whereas the original hashing algorithm would remain valid for the other blocks (1 block with new algo, one block with old, and so on). This would prevent the attacking miners from effectively blocking transactions, while still not excluding existing miners that don't support the newly proposed chain. That's just a simple (probably not optimal) solution I can come up with that keeps the blockchain secure while thwarting the attack you proposed.
Also, the minority miners don't have an incentive to switch over to the new chain if the majority of uses aren't accepting those blocks, because the mining rewards obtained there are worthless as long as users don't accept it.
Bottom line is (as stated before): users provide value, not miners, so it is the users who determine what protocol changes are accepted.
If you would like to argue that the majority of users would support (or at least not oppose) the change we are discussing, then that's a different discussion.
Your belief seems to be that people start putting value in what is mined, whereas I believe miners mine what is valuable, which is  determined by users.


Ignoring blocks that are mined in a new chain that is not accepted by the majority of users makes perfect sense. Why should they care? The 'new bitcoin' in that chain is worthless if other people don't recognize it either. They don't become instantly worthless, they *already are* worthless from the start, until users accept those blocks. So here again, it's the users that determine what is valuable, not the miners.

Indeed, but this is a continuous process. Just look back to a year ago, to a few months ago, etc. Improvements are made daily.
An entire ecosystem needs to be expanded around bitcoin. In the same way that fiat money would be hard to use if there were no banks, online payment services, etc. built around it.
If it isn't accessible enough yet, then the price might be a bit inflated, and a correction might happen. But a year after any 'pop', the price will again reach new highs. That is the nature of the beast.

Well I explained you why it wouldn't be flawed for the same reason.
The US would want to abandon the silver standard, because they don't necessarily benefit from a strong dollar. They benefit from an inflating dollar.
The Miners would *not* want to abandon the current model, because doing so would undermine the confidence people have in bitcoin, and thus undermine the value. They don't benefit from a dropping value because they are paid in it.
@_date: 2015-02-24 09:46:40
Not really though. The US government has a net *debt* of USD, so they benefit by inflation of the dollar. In addition, being able to manipulate the value benefits them greatly.
Miners would benefit with deflation of BTC value, and they have significantly less power in manipulating bitcoin. So they are less likely to do something that is bad for the value of bitcoin.

A stock doesn't gain utility by being bought by more and more people. A significant price increase in a stock, while no underlying change happened in the company of said stock, means the stock is likely overpriced and might be in a bubble.
Bitcoin's utility goes up when more people use it (see *networking effect*). It's value isn't tied to a company whose value it represents. It represents a combination of its current utility value combined with its expected future utility value.
So it might be overvalued now (although that solely depends on the future expeced utility value), but it is unlikely to be a true bubble as in a stock bubble.

The point of Bitcoin is to be able to decide for yourself how to manage it, be it by yourself completely or use a third party such as a bank for additional services.
@_date: 2015-02-17 09:40:02
A few remarks here.


It is certainly not a fundamental flaw of bitcoin any more than it is a fundamental flaw of cash/gold. Current volatility is an issue on some levels, but it's not fundamental to bitcoin in any way, and is likely to reduce in the future.


Here you're comparing fraud in a transaction with plain theft, how is this even remotely comparable? If you hold a large chunk of cash under your mattress, and someone breaks into your house to steal it, it's equally gone as if he stole your bitcoin.
Bottom line is that in reality, bitcoin will most likely not be the interface level used by the majority of people (in a similar way that cash isn't used by the majority Today either). Infrastructure will be built on top of it (e.g. Coinbase) that will eventually allow insurance/charge-back due to being able to provide that in their closed system (similarly to existing companies doing the same for transactions in USD, etc.).
The main benefits of bitcoin will be the freedom to use whatever interface level you feel comfortable with, alongside cutting transaction costs for things built on top of bitcoin (e.g. coinbase charges a lower transaction fee than PayPal due to bitcoin being cheaper to use than the banking system).
@_date: 2013-12-08 16:06:59
Adoption will indeed lead to a higher price, leading to increased interest in bitcoin as a commodity. This will in turn lead to increased adoption... And this will go on.
It will go on until the price inevitably flattens out. Compared to other commodities, however, Bitcoin is very easily transferable. This in combination with bitcoin establishing its value as a commodity, will likely lead to it becoming used for transfer of wealth as well, and thus it will be used as a currency.
Just look at gold. The only reason it is no longer used as a money is that it is not practical. If gold were as easily transferable as bitcoins, it would without a doubt still be used as such.
As for the deflation aspect. People will not lower their living standard significantly to save money. Also keep in mind that the deflation will likely be a small percentage. In the current inflationary regime, people still save money, and in a slightly deflationary regime, people will just as much still spend money.
It is not a valid approach to consider extreme deflation to draw conclusions and apply those to a situation in which there would be a small amount of deflation.
Now suppose people are hoarding bitcoins because of this moderate amount of deflation. This hoarding combined with deflation would increase the purchasing power of everyone holding this deflationary currency. Since purchasing power increases overall, demand for goods will increase. Higher demand for goods lead to an increase in production, or if that is not possible, an increase in price.
@_date: 2017-06-20 09:26:30

The price floor on all money is zero. Just look at the Zimbabwean dollar, which is worth practically nothing. This is irrelevant, however. A store of value should be able to retain its value. The only thing making that so for the USD or for gold is people's trust that tomorrow someone will still value it about the same. The 'bottom value' is irrelevant for anything worth significantly more than this bottom value. There is no reason that Bitcoin couldn't reach a point where adoption and trust in it would be high enough for it to be an effective store of value.

They can regulate it in any way they want. They could tax it, ban it, etc.
Whether people would agree to these regulations and follow them is a different question, because the government can't really control it. But I'm positive most people wouldn't really be inclined to break the law...
But an underground movement would certainly form.
Regulation is just that: creating rules and laws for people to abide.
Or an analogy: the government has regulated how fast you are allowed to drive. It is you, however, who controls how fast you actually drive. Not following the regulations exposes you to the risk of getting caught and paying a fine. They can even take away your drivers licence. That still doesn't stop you from jumping in a car and driving as fast as you like. (Do note that my analogy isn't perfect, but I hope you get the idea)

In essence, bitcoin is a digital form of 'cash'.
Due to its nature, you can send it to anyone in the world at any time with only a fraction of the fee you'd pay using the banking system, and they'll receive it nearly instant. The possibilities of such a global payment system, requiring no intermediate parties, is invaluable.
Next to these practical benefits, bitcoin is under the control of no single entity. No government or company can directly control bitcoin. They can't print more (devaluing the currency), they can't seize it (*), the can't lock your 'account', etc. You, and only you, are ever in control of your bitcoins.
These are, to me, the most valuable aspects of Bitcoin, without going into too much detail.
Edit: (*) Do note that by this I mean they can't seize properly secure bitcoins. In the same way they couldn't seize cash that they have no physical access to, they can't seize bitcoins to which they don't have 'electronical' access (the private key).

No. I think you are misunderstanding how a merchant would set it up.
As noted in previous comments a bit higher on, the merchant immediately (and often automatically via Bitpay) exchanges the received bitcoins to dollars.
The net result is:
* Client pays with bitcoins, which is easy, fast and secure.
* Vendor doesn't pay any fees, allowing him to effectively sell at a lower price.
* Vendor effectively receives dollars, because the bitcoins are exchanged immediately.

Chinese exchanges having 0% fees caused an inflated volume, making western bitcoiners believe there was a massive influx in China.
This Chinese influx, which did exist, was likely not as huge as everyone seems to believe.
The exodus of Chinese investors, which is unlikely to be as large as the preceding influx, supported by positive news on other fronts, will not cause a complete reversal of the price run-up.

Did you even understand what I said?
If he had spent an equal amount in cash on the ASIC, which would have been $15 000 (@ 5$/BTC), you believe that would have been a good idea, right?
Well that $15 000 would have been able to buy him 3000 BTC extra, which would now be worth $312 000 (@ $104/BTC). So buying the ASIC with cash would have been an equally bad idea. He should have bought bitcoins directly with it.
Bottom line is: the error is not in what currency he bought the ASIC because they are interchangeable. The error he made is not investing more in bitcoin (which at that time, no one could have predicted with certainty that it would be worth as much today).

Thanks for the answer, but I'm still left with a lot of questions. Do you happen to know of a place where colored coins are explained in an ELI5 fashion?
As for the questions I have: I thought that bitcoins entering the same address are indistinguishable. If an address receives 2 times 0.1 bitcoin, and then sends out 0.12 (and 0.8 to a change address), then there's no way to tell which came from which.
Do colored coins use a separate client to keep track of them, and if so, where are they tracked if not in the blockchain? Are colored coins lost when 'mixing' them with a regular bitcoin client?

The regulation states financial institutions can't treat bitcoin as a currency, they can't deal in bitcoin, can't create bitcoin derivatives or anything related to bitcoin.
A payment processor is *not* a financial institution, and can thus provide services related to bitcoin.
People are not prohibited to treat bitcoin in any way the like, so long as they take the risk themselves (nothing changed here...). So they are definitely not prohibited from trading bitcoin and they are not prohibited from trading it for goods.
So I believe my points still stand.
@_date: 2013-10-20 11:10:02
I think the reason for the linear correlation (can you give a source that supports this?) would rather be the following:
Higher hashrate means less money to be made by joining the bitcoin miners. People that are interested in bitcoin, and believe the price will rise, will thus more likely invest in alternatives rather than in mining hardware. The first alternative is buying bitcoin directly, driving up the price.
I don't believe the miners holding on to their mined bitcoins weighs in to the equation. At least not significantly compared to the new influx of money into bitcoin, and the general trend of people to hold on to their bitcoins expecting a price rally.

You're making valid points.
Bitcoin is still in no way a *safe haven*. It might one day become one when proper regulation is in place and adoption is more widespread.
The current value might not reflect its current utility, and it is likely overpriced at this instant.
The main point, however, with respect to Peter Schiffs, is that he claims it is a bubble as a whole and that it will never succeed for some reasons he never stated. He doesn't argue why he thinks so, because he probably doesn't understand anything about it, except that it's currently going up in price due to increased demand.

The discussion there is exactly the same as it is here. Some people explaining why they think it is good news, and some explaining the contrary...
Only difference is that on the hackers forum, a lot more people are off-topic.
And to get back to the topic: if the news means that companies similar to coinbase can't operate in China, then it would indeed be bad news. That is not the case, however...
If the goal of this regulation was to try to destroy bitcoin in China, they would have just banned it, like they did with plenty of things... The fact that they didn't outright ban it shows that they want to see this thing develop some more before deciding on it (in a more controlled environment). I personally didn't expect them to do anything else, and I can now exclude an outright ban in the short-term.
To me, that sounds rather good than bad.

To become a miner, you have to run separate mining software. Everyone is free to become a miner. At this moment, however, specialized hardware is needed to be of any use as a miner. The two 'tasks' you mention are the goal, rather than the task. The task is to solve a cryptographic problem to a sufficient degree. Once solved, you gain newly mined coins and transaction fees as a reward. The task exists purely to create competition among miners and to create a constant influx of new bitcoins, distributed in a random manner along the miners, with chances decided by a distribution weighted by processing power.
So in essense, dedicating some processing power to mining gives you a chance (proportional to the total mining power) of solving the current problem. Solving the current problem rewards you with a fixed set of Bitcoins. In addition, you add a bunch of transactions to the blockchain and receive their transaction fees.
The difficulty of the problem is adjusted with respect to the total processing power of all miners combined, in order to guarantee a somewhat constant influx of new bitcoins.
I hope all of this makes some sense... I'm not an expert in the actual details though...

Since originally there were no non-mining users, one can argue that the non-mining users are the thing that was not original. For sure UASF is a disingenuous way of trying to force change, as it's impossible to determine if/which of the "voting" users have anything at stake.
Of all the information we have, we know for sure that miners have something at stake. The BIP process was introduced to enable a coordination mechanism for upgrades, not as a voting mechanism. But equally, we shouldn't turn node count into some sort of voting mechanism, as it's impossible to know if an economic majority supports something purely based on node count.

Looks secure to me.
But please do as much research into brain wallets as you can before deciding on which pass-phrase to use. They are often way less secure than you would think.
Basically, if it has been written anywhere before, it's bad. If it's too short, it's bad.
Any good brain-wallet pass-phrase has a lot of randomness/entropy in it. For example, the Electrum seed is 12 words randomly selected from a 1628 word library, or 1628^12 , approximately equal to 2^128 . Thus equal to a 128 bit random binary number.

Bitcoin is what it is due to 'evangelists' spreading the word. If no one would have bothered to do so initially, it would never have gotten to where it is now. Patience is good, but doesn't help anything. New technologies need people to drive them, either by building systems around them, or by spreading the word. If everyone would sit back and 'be patient', nothing would come of it.

The exchange is usually done in BTC to USD or vice versa. In practice, a lot of these transactions are done with conversion of EUR or Yen to USD by the exchange.
The fact that someone would withdraw to EUR or Yen makes no difference over someone withdrawing to USD.
All BTC/Money exchanges weigh in equally in the BTC/USD rate determination.
So your arguments don't really hold up.
@_date: 2013-10-21 18:09:39
Here's why:
- *The volatile* aspect of bitcoins is true. Not placing it in a proper context by explaining that this is not inherent to bitcoin, but inherent to any medium with low adoption, shows the subjective view of the author, painting bitcoin off as if it's volatility will prevent it from being useful (which is in no way true, and which will become a none-issue if mainstream-adoption would take place).
- Phrasing it as *criticized for its relatively inflexible supply* clearly shows the negative subjective view of the writer. Other people praise it's supply model. An objective way of stating it is what was written above, that the total supply is fixed. A more in-depth explanation about the supply model is found below.
- *High risk of loss* is also rather subjective. If used properly, the risk of loss is lower than storing money in a bank, but the phrasing again indicates the personal subjective view of the writer. An objective way of giving the facts would be to explain how it works, how it could be compromised, how one could lose it, and the means to prevent losing it.
- *Minimal use in trade* is somewhat correct, but not properly contextualizing it by explaining that the uses are expanding quite significantly and that the potential usage in trade are vast shows again the subjective view of the author of that sentence.  
- The *shady online currency* is a term taken out of its context. CNN stated in the same sentence that bitcoin is gaining legitimacy. If this doesn't show the subjectivity of the writer, then what does?
- The *money laundering*, which is true for all currencies, is also properly contextualized by the FBI, which stated that they have no record yet of significant money laundering cases using bitcoin. So again, this piece of 'info' is taken out of its context, suiting the view of the writer.
Basically, the writer(s) of those lines portrayed bitcoin one sided negative, instead of remaining neutral.
These points do deserve a spot on the Bitcoin page, but *with* the proper context, and given in an objective manner.
@_date: 2013-12-26 16:00:08

Security model looks very good, as far as I can tell:
* You can enable 2FA not only for login/withdrawal, but also for changing settings and for placing orders.
* You can have mails they send you be encrypted with a PGP
* You can "lock" your account settings for up to 30 days, so that potential intruders can't change withdrawal addresses etc.

I believe the logic is incorrect.
The fact that mining technologies are not (yet) developed for Litecoin is due to it's bad adoption and still rather risky prospects.

Due to the increasing difficulty, the value of an ASIC drops faster than the bitcoins it could generate.

Error in your reasoning.
Any valuation of a choice to be made should take all costs into account, including investment costs.
@_date: 2013-10-15 15:50:28
You're showing nothing new.
An investment can, in part or in full, be a sunk cost. That is, however, irrelevant to calculating the profitability of a project. Even if the best option would be to continue mining (rather than selling the equipment), the net profitability of the mining operation would be negative, due to the initial investment.
Whether the best option is to continue mining or to sell the ASIC is a different discussion. The point that mining is unprofitable for most miners remains standing. 
EDIT: if someone asks you whether mining is profitable or not, and you say 'it is profitable, if you don't take into account the initial investment,' they will either ask you if it is profitable including initial investment, or call you a joker.

We've already seen a few stories (exceptions, generally) of people being paid in bitcoins.
I believe this will increase. People will be paid more and more in bitcoin as the usability of it increases.
Closing the 'loop' allows for more and more transfers, in all parts of the chain, to be performed by bitcoin. This will stabilize the value even more than high volumes on exchanges.
Do note that this is all long-long-term expectations... We won't be seeing such a bitcoin economy anytime soon, but this scenario is not unlikely in a situation that bitcoin continues to gain adoption.
@_date: 2013-06-13 16:27:17
Your logic is flawed.
At the time they purchased the product, bitcoins were only worth so much. Buying with bitcoin or with cash is essentially equivalent, because the two are interchangeable. 
If you believe their choice of spending 3000 BTC on an ASIC was bad, then spending cash that could buy 3000 BTC on an ASIC is an equally bad choice. If you believe spending cash to buy an ASIC is a good idea, then spending BTC to buy it is an equally good idea, because you can just re-buy the BTC with the cash you save.
TL;DR: there's no difference between buying with BTC or buying with cash.

That is not at all what you are saying now.
Also, the title doesn't say mining is *NEVER* profitable. It says it isn't profitable, which means that it is in general unprofitable, which is true.
I also never said that mining is never profitable, I defend the title in the generalization it makes, not in claiming that there is no single case where mining is profitable...

This 'intrinsic value' is in itself worthless, however.
Fiat currency has the 'intrinsic value' that you can physically give it to someone standing next to you with easy. Or fiat currency can (if we're talking about bills) be burned for heat. This intrinsic value is worthless however. 
If no one would use bitcoins, then being able to send one to someone anywhere in the world is rather pointless, thus it doesn't have any *real* intrinsic value. Claiming it does is just misunderstanding the true meaning behind 'intrinsic value'.

Don't you see the error in this? You're claiming that people are well off if they bought the miner with USD, but if they bought it with BTC, they should have bought BTC instead?
It doesn't matter with which they bought the miner, because the opportunity cost remains the same.
If they bought with USD, the opportunity cost is that they could have bought BTC with it.
If they bought with BTC, the opportunity cost is that they could have kept their BTC.
Both those that bought with BTC as with USD could have taken a different option netting them an equal amount of BTC, higher than what they'll be able to mine.

It's "pro" for people holding bitcoins and hoping for their value to increase.
If the goal of a merchant is purely to add another payment method without wanting to do any speculation on the value of bitcoins themselves, then losing time by having to explain it is, at least in part, a downside. Upside from explaining it is potentially increased sales due to the consumers becoming aware of potentially lower transaction costs, that might reflect in the price.

These are good questions! Questions that anyone coming into contact with bitcoin thought to themselves at first.


To answer this question, I'll explain a bit how the system works. On a technological level, the bitcoin network basically has users and providers. Bitcoin is called decentralized because everyone can join in helping to be a provider, there is no single entity 'providing' the bitcoin service, it is a bit like torrents or other peer-to-peer networks. The users simply use the network by sending and receiving transactions. The providers process these transactions in a process called *mining*. The reward for mining is a fixed reward (creation of new bitcoins, essentially "out of thin air") combined with the transaction fees. These transaction fees are basically voluntarily, as a user can set these himself, and are in the order of magnitude of a few dollar cents. If you want your transactions to be processed in a timely fasion, you would set the fee at a certain 'recommended value' (a few cents). If there is no rush on the transaction, you can even set the fee to 0, it will eventually be processed anyway. So this is the reason why transactions in Bitcoin (a small fixed maximum value) are considered to have significantly lower fees than VISA (~3%), or western union (~10%), or the banking system. Besides the fee, a transaction propagates nearly instant through the network.


Bitcoin is called secure because the network itself is virtually unhackable. It is impossible to hack more bitcoins into existance, to fake transactions or to duplicate bitcoins.
Bitcoins that someone owns can, however, definitely be stolen, if improperly secured. In essence you have an address which stores your bitcoins. This address has a private key and a public key. The public key is used to notify the network who you are and where you can receive bitcoins, the private key is used to spend bitcoins. As long as no one knows your private key, it is impossible for them to steal your bitcoins. This private key can be seen as the code to a safe in your house where you would store physical cash, but instead purely digital. 
The main issue is that this concept is new to a lot of people, which can lead to user mistakes. It is important to inform yourself before acquiring bitcoins. If, for example, you store your private key insecurely, a hacker could compromise your computer's security, and steal the private key, then transfer the funds to an address of his. Or if you are careless and don't have back-ups of this key, and your hard drive crashes, you could lose this key, meaning you effectively lost access to your bitcoins. Since there is no central entity in control, this also means you won't see those bitcoins back ever.
If informed properly, bitcoins can be stored more securely than even cash in a bank vault.


I didn't express myself optimally by using the word "they". There isn't really a "they" in bitcoin. There are the miners (see my answer to the first question) who provide the service of processing transactions, and by doing this, bitcoins are created *at a fixed rate*, diminishing over time. But there is no one that can take control over bitcoin. The only "danger" is if a single entity would gain control of an overwhelming amount of processing power, but the required amount is too costly in comparisson with the benefit it would bring.
In general: bitcoin can be tricky, and it would be wise to be informed about different aspects before throwing yourself into this world. New companies and tools are being created to bridge the gap between all the technical things and real user-friendliness.
I believe everyone can benefit from it, and as time passes, it will become easier and easier to enter it, as more and more services are built on top of it.
If anything is unclear, please ask, I don't have time to read and rewrite my post... :p

You're missing the point...
Let's go over the 5 sources given:
- Source 15 is from April 2012: hardly relevant about a new subject that is quickly evolving.
- Source 16 is in fact a nuanced statement from which only one side is portrayed in the intro. That's not an objective representation of the info in the article, that is manipulation by the person who uses that article as a source to make claims in accordance with his personal views.
- Source 17 is a sensationalist article from someone with no economic understanding, as the person is mixing the terms 'money' and 'currency' as if they mean the same. The article can hardly be called an objective view.
- Source 18 is an article from April 2011: same conclusion as source 15. It discusses the bitcoin 'experiment' up to that point. Its views are not up to date with current developments. The new conclusion by the writer might still be negative, but the point stands that the article itself is not really relevant in the discussion anymore as it is severely outdated.
- Source 19: The only objective source in the list of five. This discusses a study performed in April 2013 and states facts, rather than opinions.
So to conclude: only 1 of the 5 sources used to support the statement is objective and somewhat relevant. The others are just picked to support the individual view of the writer of the statement in the introduction.
Now I'm not saying his meaning isn't worth something, I'm only saying that statements based more on subjective things than on objective facts should be properly contextualized.

50% of the miners would somehow have to coordinate this effort...
I doubt there would ever be market enough to accommodate that amount of short-selling. Not to mention that it would be pretty obvious if it were to happen, and the miners participating would forfeit their investment in ASICs being totally worthless after such a stunt.
So in theory possible, but in practice not realistic.

Anything can be done if a consensus is reached on the network. If a majority agrees on something, then it can be implemented.
Manipulating anything however, in such a way, can have severe consequences on the price people value bitcoin at. If people see that miners manipulate things in a detrimental way, trust in the system and in the integrity is lost.
So in reality, the miners would have no incentive to do so, since doing so would net them more bitcoins, but whose value would probably tank.

Reads a lot easier. I don't really understand the economical terms... What is *%K*?
I don't agree with your overall assessment, though (unless I am misinterpreting it).
This will most likely be just a correction of an over-eager upward trend. The low for this correction stands at around $150 (Bitstamp), which is still a nice gain compared to pre-SR shutdown prices. The trend will likely continue. So holding a long-term short position will not pay-off, I believe.
There are plenty exchanges that are unaffected by the things happening to Mt.Gox (which aren't really bitcoin-related, but more operational problems which any business could face). And also important to note is that there is more to Bitcoin than what happens in the US. Mt.Gox isn't really affected in Europe and Asia.
The shutting down of SR created an increase in confidence in bitcoin and will cause an overall growth.

Currency *as we know it* is a sovereign system. Doesn't mean other systems couldn't work. Telephony was a system over the wire... Things change.
Which brings me to the next point... Changing a system happens a lot more often than only when it fails. It changes when there is a need for improvement, or it changes when a previously unexisting need is created by a new system.
You can question the utility and the added value of bitcoin, and you can question whether it will ever be adopted or if it might work. Those would be valid points to bring up. But painting it off as if there is a giant secret, a scam, behind it... That's just adding nothing to the discussion.

The feds don't have 600,000 BTC.
600,000 is the alleged commission taken over the years that SR was up. A big part of that was already spend on working costs. And the remainder is still in the possession DPR.
The feds could seize about 27,000 bitcoins (last I checked). Which could, at most, create a small impact.

These *shake-outs* are a necessary evil. I don't like them either, but the next time the price climbs up, it will do so with increased confidence, rather than being held up with everyone twitching nervously, almost expecting something to go wrong.
One year ago, "news" similar to this would have caused a far larger decrease in price and confidence than now. And next time some rumors pop up, it will be reflected even less in the price.
These steps will keep happening, and they will benefit stability and confidence in the long run.

I agree that in general this is true. However, the recent increase in hashrate is not proportional to the price increase. I believe the increased hashrate is preceding the expected price growth, and will now prevent more people from joining in mining. A lot of people will likely instead invest in bitcoin directly, driving up the price.
So to a certain degree, hashrate also influences Bitcoin price. But offcourse not as much as Bitcoin price determines hashrate.

The transitional period will likely not be abrupt, but rather have a period in which fiat and crypto live side by side. Some countries will transition earlier, some later.
As long as there is this slow transition period still using both currencies, en gradually easing towards more and more cryptocurrencies, no one will really be left behind.

There is certainly a high difficulty level in Bitcoin. That is why infrastructure needs to be built on top of the protocol to facilitate handling of bitcoins. Looking at the past year, the improvement is immense.
Stories like OP's will remain prevalent even with improved infrastructure, because the possibility of using low-level means of handling bitcoins remain, and should remain. Only when adoption is truly mainstream, will things like this happen way less frequent.

I'm not opposed to inflation, just to make that clear, and I would have no problem with an inflationary alt-coin.
I just don't believe all the horror stories, and I have yet to see statistics of an actual problem concerning moderate deflation.
Just a quick glimpse of the [Japanese saving rate]( indicates to me that their deflation is apparently not leading to increased savings... Who is to say the problems in Japan aren't caused by other factors. Why even pick out the one country with deflation, when there are so many with inflation that have worse problems.
From a consumer perspective, there is barely a difference between moderate inflation and moderate deflation. People still save during inflation, and people wouldn't hold off spending in a moderate deflation. Buying things makes people happy, hoarding doesn't. So unless deflation would grow out of hand, nothing will change from a consumer perspective.
From an investor perspective, there could be a problem, but this topic is equally controversial. Many people believe otherwise as well.

I can agree on the fact that stating the generalization that mining is unprofitable is not correct.
In your case, you are indeed turning a profit mining, but isolated cases should also not lead to globalized statements that mining is profitable.
And as to why someone would stop mining if their revenues exceed their marginal cost? Here's some learning for you to do: [Opportunity Cost]( Mining equipment is overvalued. If the current trends continue, most people would be better off selling their ASIC for BTC than to continue mining with it.
@_date: 2013-10-15 06:38:04
If 0.11 BTC is significant some day, then the optimal option would obviously be to sell the mining equipment and buy BTC with it directly.
The only meaningful way to look at it is considering how much BTC you could obtain by selling it (*A*) versus how much BTC you can reasonably expect to mine (*B*).
If *A* is larger than *B*, then no matter what the price of bitcoin is, and no matter what the future price will be, it is better to sell the miner. (or vice versa)

In retrospect, you can see peaks because you just locate the maximum pricepoint before which the price started dropping.
In real-time, you see a price going up, but how are you to determine if it reached a peak, or if it will continue to go up higher? Small decreases are natural and in no way determine if a peak has reached. These small drops are also not predictable. And when the real drop happens, you will only be able to tell afterwards or during the actual fall. And that will already be too late.

I think that increasing the utility value of bitcoin for a consumer (by allowing him to purchase goods without touching fiat) is helping the bitcoin economy expand tremendously.
The added value of being able to actually use bitcoins probably drives up the price more than the bitpay selling the bitcoins they receive in transactions would drive the price down.

Depending on the implementation of these regulations that will eventually inevitably come, they could very well have a positive impact!
If regulations don't *ban* bitcoin, but rather just give them a legal frame to work in, then that would be immensely positive news.
@_date: 2013-12-05 14:33:44
Look at it this way: 
Regulations have to come eventually in all parts of the world. Short term, these regulations will look restricting (because they are) and cause a bit of a stir and panic. The "good" part about this news is that they don't make Bitcoin illegal, which they very well could have done. Long term, these regulations are a necessary 'evil' to go towards a mainstream adoption.
So in essence, the fact that this somewhat bad news is not terrible, is in itself good news. Now China has some regulation in place, a legal framework, that doesn't go completely against Bitcoin.

This is a natural first step, necessary for any and all businesses adding Bitcoin as a payment option until bitcoin holds a more stable value.
Since no one expects any company to truly accept bitcoins (since they can't do anything with it themselves), this is quite an impressive step towards adoption.

Without going into detail about what should/can be expected, it's in the best interest of the ATM owner to give the 100% as a reward to encourage people in general to report issues.
If people can chose between "no action" and keeping their windfall or "taking action" and having to hand in part of it, I'm positive a lot of people would go for option 1. Offering the option of "taking action" *and* keeping the windfall will sway most people into taking action.

Sorry for the late reply (edit: and for the long reply, I tried to keep it as structured as possible).
You are comparing apples to pears, and then taking the wrong conclusion from it.
Lets first go from your two situations. The error of the second situation is then not going into 30k cash debt. This could get 30k worth of bitcoins, which would later be worth 300k. And you obtained the exact same result (which was my point all along).
But even more so, in your first situation, not buying the machine with the 30k cash, but instead investing it as well in bitcoins would leave you with 600k in the end, and a 30k cash debt. Or a net outcome of 570k, but no machine, which is far better.
So to conclude, *comparing equal start situations shows that the error is not which currency was invested, but how much was invested in total*. And secondly, we can also see that investing in the machine turned out to be a bad idea in itself (which would have been totally different had it arrived at the time as advertised, which he couldn't have known either).
And lastly, a bit of a sidenote, you shouldn't evaluate decisions purely on their outcome. If I give you 10 to 1 odds on me flipping a coin and it landing on heads. And you decide to gamble $100, hoping to win $1000. If it then lands tails, you still made a good decision, it just ended poorly due to bad luck.

Bitcoin was mainly experimental. I don't think Satoshi ever even thought it would have grown this big.
So chances that he envisioned all of this as a grand scheme to get rich are small.
And even if he somehow foresaw all of this, the Bitcoin protocol can work irrespective of his vision/plan. If he becomes rich (might not be the case because he might have lost control of a lot of the bitcoins he mined early on), then it's not really that different from other people who came up with good ideas that worked (e.g. Mark Zuckerberg, etc.).

There would be no "periodical cash-out". It would be a continuous process. Any bitcoin coming in would be cashed out that very same moment, because a merchant wouldn't expose himself to the volatility. And any bitcoin spent and re-sold on an exchange wouldn't need "new money". If a bitcoin is spent, it is done so by someone placing value in its usage. This person would re-buy it.
As many said in this thread, a liquidity problem would only occur when trust in Bitcoin was lost.
@_date: 2013-11-19 11:02:47
The problem is the following:
You see the price dropping, as does everyone else. If it keeps dropping, everyone will start to 'panic' and think "*this is the crash*" everyone will put in sell orders. But because everyone is doing so at the same time, and there are barely any buyers, the chance of your sell order being filled in is low (because it is likely someone else put a lower priced sell order in before someone decided to buy your bitcoins). You see the price dropped below your sell order without it filling in, so you retract your sell order and put a new one lower than the current lowest sell order. Since everyone is doing this, the price tanks, and barely anyone sold any coins.

This transaction fee is in dollar (edit: the actual fee is in bitcoin *offcourse*! but the transaction fee mentioned a few posts up was in dollar, hence the clarification of the question... don't downvote me because you don't understand what the question was...). This fee goes to the miner that processes your transaction. Basically a payment for the processing power that sustains the bitcoin network.
EDIT: If anyone feels the need to chip in some more downvotes, at least tell me where I am wrong...

If it is written in law, which is agreed upon by the majority, it is by definition their "*right*" to take your money. This might not "*make it right*" in your eyes, but still, you were stretching the definition.

Holding on to the one last shred of a point you have doesn't validate the rest of your statements.

I had heard that there was a difference, but didn't look too much further in it and just assumed that ASICs could be designed in a similar fashion as for Bitcoin.
But I think that in general this difference isn't seen as a large enough one. Especially since SHA256 seems to be working out for Bitcoin, so it's not seen as a problem at all.
Why this is, I believe, is because cheaper hardware makes mining more accessible in general, not really favoring anyone either. So proportionally, in the long run, it will likely get as distributed.

The point is that they are not properly contextualized and painted in a way according to the writer's view. Not that the statements themselves are wrong.
The same information can be given in an unbiased, neutral way, as it should be.
Information on Wikipedia should not be editorialized, it should not be interpreted by the writer and should be portrayed in a neutral way.
My explanation above should be sufficient to show that this was not the case.
Edit: example: If I make the statement "*The united states has invaded many countries and caused a lot of grief for a lot of families*". This statement would be true as well, but without the proper context, this information doesn't leave the reader to form his own opinion.

I somewhat agree that moving to bitcoin can reduce a lot of the costs by not having to pay for things like the one offered by OP.
On the other hand, it is important to make bitcoin accessible for everyone. This solution still offers the benefits of bitcoin (low transaction fees) while keeping it accessible to both non-te-savy merchants and non-tech-savvy buyers.
The bottom line is that it is all about who you're trying to target as a merchant, and where you want to go in the long-term. If you only want to target tech-savvy people and don't care about anything else, then you can save money by not spending money on this 'shit'.
If you want to target a broader audience, and future-proof your point-of-sale, or if you're not very tech-savvy, but still want to accept bitcoin, etc... Then this solution is quite good.

Irreversible and instantaneous payments allow for platforms to be built onto it that offer slow reversible payments (e.g. bank-like off-chain transactions offered by a company).
If the core is slow and reversible, you can't really offer instantaneous and irreversible transfer.
Security is something that can be improved. Time-to-transfer can't all of a sudden be made instantaneous for a lot of legacy transfer methods.
I hope that somewhat explains why these are features. This doesn't mean that these features don't come with risks. For example, a car driving fast is a feature, the fact that you need to have adequate security, adequate seatbelts and brakes, etc. doesn't all of a sudden make it not a feature anymore.

A slight nuance: the whole point of bitcoin is *not to force people* to use other people to manage their money.

If it would ever become what so many hope, and your current bitcoins turn out to be a fortune, it will only be so due to mainstream adoption of it and integration of it in existing systems.
For this reason, it seems unlikely you'd have to convert it back into a local currency when you could just use bitcoin.
