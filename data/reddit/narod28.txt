You get confirmations instantly? Between another coinbase account? :) If you send it out to me on my software wallet (electrum), you think it will be instant? Or if you pay for something in real life with it, let's say a coffee in Japan (I've heard many streets shops support it there) - you think it's going to be instant?
Transaction will be, but you have to wait for confirmations if you want to use these funds that you send.

I’m not, using electrum on my pc, good old fashion way :)

So does lightning node owners get something from transactions later when this network scales a lot to the point where most of the bitcoin users will use it?
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:34:46
Two blocks in few minutes... without my transaction... guess 20 sat is low again?
@_date: 2018-05-12 07:51:20
What are you talking about? I just received 4 BTC from this!
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:25:47
The f guys what’s up with blocks... been waiting for hour already for confirmation. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:23:09
oh lol... that was a joke, I though everyone would understand
@_date: 2018-05-14 15:32:43
Fu.. that’s what I hate about BTC... even when you put normal fee... it’s still can stuck for hours 
@_date: 2018-05-14 21:17:58
And what's even more interesting, how few hours ago 1 block was found in like 1 hour 20 minutes and NO ONE here said a thing besides me and 2 other people... which really shows how much in reality people use bitcoin... Some of us use it yeah, but most of the people here go on praying "I SEE 9K TODAY!" while selling and buying BTC inside some bitfinex without even using it in real life at all. That shows that real value of this thing is WAY LESS than even 8k.
Sorry for the rant, just tired of this thing messing up my plans when it's important, and working like magic when I don't give a fuck.
@_date: 2018-05-12 09:24:45
But isn't the first nodes would get more than like 100,000 created node? Or every node in the network is treated completely the same?

Oh seriously, okay I get all that HODL feeling and that stuff... but beyond that shit you guys seriously believe that it will sometime go even more than 1 mil for 1 btc ? :) Really? Give me a break. This shit can die off in just a few years. Yeah blockchain technology is the future for something, but bitcoin... I don't know about that.

Is this real?

@_date: 2017-09-15 15:46:07
fuck should've bought on 2970... that's when I blinked for few hours hoping it to got down even more and it's in 3600 now
jesus fuck could have made thousands in few hours
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:25:50
I was always interested how does that work? For example there were a recent fork... how can I get same value in new coin that I had in BTC?
I use offline wallet on mine PC.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:26:26
lol people are so dumb...
block this domain from ever posting here
@_date: 2018-03-26 09:46:18
Do you guys think it will go at least till 9500 by the end of this month?
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:15:16
shit stop... need 12k!
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:28:38
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:11:50
Why? Cause it's better than BTC? 
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:00:41
Dude doesn't even know that it was some ad screen come on. They just randomly brute into such computers and install their software.
The real question is the fuck owner of this screen used so low security password?
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:46:07

F**King shit again I missed 8k to sell it, going down now
@_date: 2018-04-25 19:52:17
Have unconfirmed outgoing transaction with 7 sats for like 4 hours already fuck! And I thought 5 sats is pretty fast to get confirmation nowadays. Yesterday received bunch of transactions with 5 sats in minutes...
Also receiving transactions now with 60 sats!!!! and still no confirmations for 1 hour already.
@_date: 2018-04-09 14:59:10
Ok no problem... wait im sending
but I only have 1.12 shit sorry cant help
@_date: 2018-04-16 07:53:05

expect ATH?
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:05:17
It got confirmed after 8 hours
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:41:30
My trx got confirmed (the ones with 7 sats)... good luck to yours!
But I was waiting like 8 hours :(
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:46:15
Do you even read my post?
I told you I EARN money in BTC. I don't invest anything EVER in BTC or any other crypto.
@_date: 2018-04-06 06:24:33
@_date: 2018-04-13 23:53:30
Going to sleep, it better not be less than 7900 when I wake up in 7 hours.
(This means it will probably be like 6k considering my luck with this shit...)
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:11:13
Nah I'm not trading, I earn parts of my profits in btc... so I either hodl or get rid of it right away.
Have been hodling since 15k in January because someone told me that (yup it hit 20k, so it will bounce back pretty soon LOL), couldn't take this shit anymore (and needed cash actually) so sold yesterday.
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:08:33
Fuck, I've had a few transactions yesterday with 5 sats per byte get confirmed in like next or 3 blocks easily.
Why is this happening now?
@_date: 2018-04-25 13:04:29
So is there any chance it's going to get back to at least 9500 today?
@_date: 2018-04-25 11:28:03
F**K and I believed in 10k in next few days.
Should've sold on 9700
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:47:28
Does anyone know what's the normal transaction fee now? 
Put 7 satoshies per byte (total fee 2$ something dollars) for a quite big transaction, it's been unconfirmed for over 1 hour now.
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:21:26
Lol what? We expecting 10k here dude
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:18:50
I just sold the shit I've been hodling since January when I got it when it was 15k (I didn't buy I just receive payments in it). Whole 2017 I've fucking sold the same hour I received and was butthurting remembering how April 2017 I've sold 2 BTC for some shitting 2 thousands or so. Then all of the sudden I decide to hodl in January and here we are now... 
But I've sold all of it (I need money anyway this month, so probably it wont hit 10k in April again), so expect ALL TIME HIGH knowing my luck. You welcome guys
I just hate that I didn't sold 12 hours ago at 9700 :(
@_date: 2018-04-25 21:14:59
Yeah looks like but still a lot of unconfirmed transactions.
Received that trx with 60 sats... well of course I didn't had doubts about it.
@_date: 2018-04-26 23:05:54
Hmm... the fuck I sold at 9150 yesterday? :))
But still doesnt look like a healthy grow... probably gonna go down anyway at some point, maybe before 10k or after 10k.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:23:09
I still need to sell it by the end of the month (need money) so hope I've made the right choice... cause I sure don't believe it will hit 10k this month. Later in 2018 - SURE, but I need fiat now.
