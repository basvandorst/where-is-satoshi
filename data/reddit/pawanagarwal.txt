:-X...I believe at this time you are the one on the side of ignorance...here are some links for you:
1) Jan 9th Financial times article:  Key excerpts: "China is moving to wipe out its bitcoin mining industry following concerns of excessive electricity consumption and financial risk, in the latest sign of Beijing’s hostility to cryptocurrencies." "A multi-agency task force has instructed provincial governments to “actively guide” companies in their respective regions to exit the cryptocurrency mining industry, according to a document seen by the Financial Times"

dont think so. When stock market goes down, everything goes down with it.

You are right. Government will try to control it, but I feel eventually they will fail. Bitcoin is a store of value. If China blocks trading via internet, people will take physical trezor wallets with bitcoins and sell it in china. Nobody can stop that. There will always be a market for that. 
Jinni is out of the bottle.

Adding links from Financial Times, Forbes &amp; other publications with articles on China banning bitcoin mining. This is for people who are questioning this question and asking me to do my research. Financial times is very reputable and reliable source of information.

Agreed...if a miner is ready to spend fiat...he can buy Bch with fiat money and then pay for bitmain miners...that does not explain why they started accepting fiat...

it is likely...if main street drops further then easy money in system goes down and risky assets like bitcoin fall further..

It's not that simple my friend...it will be hard to make ASICs anywhere other than China because of hardware expertise there. 
For mining operations, there are very few better place than China with cheaper electricity...May be Quebec...but labor and other operational costs will be expensive..

No one is saying we will be better off with China banning it. We are definitely worse off. Question is how much worse and will people do anything to participate in crypto.
Take a scenario...when rout is halted..let’s say at 1k/2k or whatever usd. Let’s assume Chinese people are banned to invest in it and then BTC starts to rise...do you think then Chinese people will just sit and let others make profit or they will find a way to jump in..I bet they will find a way to jump in and when they demand will come!!
