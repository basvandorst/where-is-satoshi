It doesn't matter at all whether the currency is deflating or inflating. When one gives out a loan they are loaning value not items. When the loan is paid back it is paid in an amount equivalent to the initial value.

No shit; that is why he is asking.

But how can they know it's yours? Sure, it is clear that money spent from say 16ZvPb21H6e8BhrWNuPyZj4RUcfygn8enj came from 1KecDYadohxk8MCDqKF8SBEMhCUNveAsCj but that doesn't prove that the owner of the latter owns the private key of the former.
Also, I don't mean just having one input and 200 outputs. I mean having one or more inputs then a random number of outputs which are then moved again to another set of random outputs and another and another.

"&lt; 1 second" While technically correct, this statement is not completely honest because merchants will usually wait for network confirmations.

Can you give me an example of one of these "basic cross validation techniques"? The only way I see these being tracked is if you are using the same IP address for all the transactions.

Tutanota asks for data I don't wish to give and that I don't believe it should have.

Lots of people are complaining about this "system down" bs but there is a very simple solution: Ask up front.
There; not too hard, eh?
@_date: 2016-07-16 04:30:30
Sure, if my opinion doesn't conform with yours it's clearly "off-topic" and "silly". GFYS I thought we were having a serious discussion.
@_date: 2016-07-16 03:50:20
I'm speaking for the opposite. People *do* need to understand a lot about Bitcoin to use it properly and securely.

Where is the changelog?
@_date: 2016-07-16 03:22:56
By "understand Bitcoin" I don't mean "understand the blockchain" or even "understand the Bitcoin protocol." Simple things like transaction inputs/outputs goes over people's heads. And the less you know the less secure you are. Your regular Joe has never heard of "signing" or can deal with huge, human meaningless addresses. Hell, people have trouble coming up with a proper password.
Ignorance -&gt; Insecurity -&gt; Theft -&gt; Anger
Changing the system or the documentation are the only solutions I see here.

I understand it. I'm arguing that


So we need to make it easier to understand or change it.

The guy has a point. It takes me several weeks of work to explain to someone what Bitcoin is let alone why they should use it. We need either better informational videos or an interface that doesn't compromise security and independence for ease of use.

That sounds like a really good option! Thanks again!

I agree that people that don't understand Bitcoin can't properly and shouldn't use it. It's what I'm saying. It's a problem we can and should fix.
@_date: 2016-07-18 02:16:47
I mean in Core.
@_date: 2016-07-16 04:06:24
You say this as if secure Bitcoin transactions were as simple as handing a bill or swiping a card. I'm sorry but that is just not the case for most people.

I know I can do it all from the console. I want to know if the vanilla client lets me, say, send from a 2/3 multisig relatively simply from the GUI.

Weapon from massacre bought with cash... ban the dollar!
@_date: 2016-07-18 02:57:09
Alright; thanks. I suppose I over estimated the Bitcoin protocol (or at least it's main client).
