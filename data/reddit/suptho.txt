What does the commodity do? Nothing. 
It’s absolutely, 100%, *not* a commodity. Commodities are physical, real, tangible things that have value OTHER THAN the dollar amount that people are willing to pay for them. For example, agricultural products are commodities because you can make food with them.

No it’s not, you moron. Bitcoin has zero utility except as a currency.
@_date: 2019-07-07 16:24:20
So you have zero clue what utility means. Got it. Please stop replying to me, I've lost enough IQ points for one day.
@_date: 2019-07-07 13:07:26
And what would that be? Please look up the definition of utility before you answer.

The CME is looking pretty silly for even attempting to host this insanity. Taking a credibility hit.

Dude, you really don't know the difference between futures and options, do you? They're two entirely different derivatives and professions. There's no way you're this nooby
I'd be butthurt too if I got owned as bad as you just did

Professional futures trader here
Prediction: the CME is going to suspend the release of bitcoin futures indefinitely due to excessive volatility and instability. The result will be a big drop in the price. 
This isn't a serious market, this is a circus. The exchanges can't even stay online.

I suppose you're right. I still think it'd be beneficial for bitcoin to split though. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:35:54
I understand that.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:34:49
I understand that. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:38:15
I understand all of that. However, if bitcoin actually becomes the future of currency, are you really going to go to the store and ask the baker for 0.0000000001 bitcoin worth of bread?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:51:36
I suppose. It'd be just be pretty convoluted to name and remember all the multiples...
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:53:25
Right, this is what I was referring to. I think it's likely to happen if bitcoin is here to stay for a long time.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:30:24
When stocks become really expensive, like $1000+, companies do "stock splits" to bring the price down to a reasonable level to entice more people to invest. So: say you hold 1 share of a company trading at $1000. It decides to do a 10/1 stock split. Your 1 share becomes 10 shares when the new stock price becomes $100.
Has there ever been talk of bitcoin doing something similar? Is this even possible?
Edit: Guys I understand that bitcoins are divisible. I'm saying that people would be more inclined to buy bitcoin if 1 bitcoin was like $50 as opposed to $10,000.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:35:46
I understand that.

It's proof that the subjective theory of value is wrong, hahaha
@_date: 2013-11-22 01:03:57


What the fuck does that mean? That literally made zero sense.
Bottom line: gold can be use to make shit, bitcoin can't. I can't believe I'm even trying to argue that point, it's not debatable. It's a fact. If you disagree with that, you're wrong, plain and simple. I will be ignoring any further replies from you, I'm losing IQ points.

@_date: 2013-11-21 23:43:04
Do you really not get it? Bitcoin IN ITSELF serves literally no purpose. None. Gold has many many uses - industrial, aesthetic, etc. Bitcoin in and of itself has literally no value. You can't do anything with a bitcoin besides send it to someone else. That's the point Peter was making in the video. How can you not wrap your mind around that simple concept?
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:08:42
You're not getting it... gold has intrinsic value because people actually use gold itself (ex: industrial uses, jewelry etc). The same cannot be said for bitcoin, and he's right in that respect.
@_date: 2013-11-21 23:15:06
Yes, the same way any other clothing accessory has intrinsic value. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 06:19:01

I'm going to have to refer you to my 5th sentence, when I say exactly that. The second sentence was a typo, I was on my phone. But extremely good shit my man, you have a firm grasp on the English language (except for the word "intrinsic"). Give yourself a pat on the back.
Your argument continues to fall apart the more you try to convince yourself that bitcoin has intrinsic value. I highly suggest googling the following terms: first, "intrinsic", and when you finally understand that word, "uses for gold". I think you just may be surprised at what you find. Start here: [Uses of Gold in Industry, Medicine, Computers, Electronics, Jewelry](
Now, enlighten me. What can I do with a bitcoin? Can I make anything with it? Can I wear it? Can I do *anything* with it? The answer is no. Hopefully you're beginning to see the holes in your argument.
**tl;dr: You're wrong.**
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:48:30
Actually yes, those assumptions are correct. It's still frustrating though, because instead if being able to recoup some of my losses (bought at $850) I have to watch it dip and then rocket until the 11th. Not investing more than you can afford to lose is common sense.
