Hmm... maybe I completely misunderstood what I thought was now available. I agree that stablecoins are still pretty experimental and I also don’t want to trade crypto to crypto. 
I’ll need to find out if what I want to do is even possible. Surely there is an exchange that allows you to trade with btc in a forex type market. They show bitcoin against the US dollar on trade view [here](

Ok I’ll check out shapeshift. I’m assuming I was wrong about only being able to trade crypto to crypto and I can trade btcusd or even gbpusd?
I’ll look into trezor and any software for keeping keys locally on my computer would have to work with Mac. I used to have a program called armoury, will that be any good?

Sounds perfect, as long as they don’t sell without letting people know they are planning too. 
Is there not a limit to bitcoins? 21 million I thought? So once that number is reached what happens to the miners?

It looks like shapeshift is for coin to coin? I will be looking to trade coin against currencies. I think trade view looks to suit my needs? And then Trezor for a wallet.

I’m in the U.K.  I’m guessing in this day and age local butcoins has been clamped down on? A few years ago I had and spent some bitcoins and I bet the guy in Ireland who accepted cash in the post was not paying tax. I guess he cashed in on the lax regulations at that time. 
Your right maybe just keeping crypto is the best but that’s not so much trading. I’ll need to do a lot more research into stable coins if I’m going to go for it. Otherwise I might just save in bitcoin and trade forex for the time being.

I’m still not 100% how stablecoins work so I’ll probably avoid them. 
I’ve not come across such stocks before. I’m going to assume the value is directly tied to btc? Is it a holding company with a large balance of btc or something? I could prove interesting and an easier way to trade btc for me, and then I can just buy some btc and save it when I have some liquid cash.
