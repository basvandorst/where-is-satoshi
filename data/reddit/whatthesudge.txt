I feel like tipping is a great incentive but because of the expectations of the US it feels like people are jaded and don't like tipping. As an Aussie who has visited the US, I would definitely tip back home if they provide great service, I just would appreciate it being the norm.

Compared to Hawaii ( at the very least from where I can compare) Australia has a better base service. That is I can walk into any Aussie restaurant and enjoy a good meal with good service. But that also being said, Australia can get lazy with food because they aren't seeking tips! I have had my fair share of average meals for sure 
For me where it changes is when people are expected to pay. I've been on multiple cruises where tipping is optional and honestly, I've come across some incredible waiters and bar staff who go above and beyond! And those are the people I am willing to pay tips to.

Unfortunately it's more of a Brazilian grill situation but it's worth every btc ��

That's exactly it! BTC may be volatile but if people can accept $400k usd for a lambo in BTC, others can be fine if people spend $20-40 usd on a meal
