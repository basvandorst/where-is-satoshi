Same story here but, I also made donations to the EFF and Wikileaks for a grand total of 10 btc...it’s really been tough these past couple weeks.  It was a funny story when it was 10-20-30k but, now it’s starting to sting a little.  I take solace in knowing that had I been holding since those early days, I’d have greatly reduced my stack by taking profits.  Learned my lesson.  I’ll die before I sell my ETH for less than life changing cash.

You’re fucking embarrassing.

Good luck with the fees on those small transactions.

Heavy stuff dude.  Maybe you should just dictate the next episode of InfoWars.

Yeah, I dot really care.  If you wanna call a whole country retarded maybe you should look up how many people live there...or else you’ll sound a tad bit retarded.  
And oh, why worthless?  The Bundesbank is literally the only reason your money isn’t toilet paper.

What are you talking about?  Hopefully you’re German, bc if your not, your opinion is fucking worthless.  How hilarious is it that Germany conquered Europe without firing a bullet this time?  Crafty motherfuckers.

I saw the opposite last week.  Some dude pumped about 10k in bills into a BTC ATM at a gas station by my parents place.  He had several fat wads in envelopes he was pumping in as fast as possible.  I wanted to say something about the fees while I was checking out but, I figured he was probably just some idiot wanting to wash money.  God bless.

This is why I always thought bitcoin would fail...everything cool and open source always dies.  I’d love to have the 10 btc (now $80,000) dollars I donated to the EFF and Wikileaks back in the day but, life ain’t fair.

Anyone still romanticizing Woodstock should eat a bullet for dinner.  Congrats on going to one shitty music festival grandpa...

What I wrote had nothing to do with people FOMOing in BTC.  I'm just saying 1k isn't a lot of money.  He could buy 1 share of Amazon...would that be a better investment?  Maybe.  Maybe not.  In all honesty, I think bitcoin is going to be torn to shreds by the miners.  Everything revolutionary and decentralized has failed...I don't think this will be any different.

If someone is working at 16, and interested in Blockchain, odds are 1k won't be life changing for very long.  Seriously, I understand people have very different financial situations but, 1k is objectively not a ton of money.

I have one around the corner from me.  It takes cash, gives a qr code for a 6% fee, and I believe you needed to give it a phone # to txt.  Don’t remember exactly, I used it a year back just to see how they worked.  
@_date: 2018-04-23 02:39:48
It is.
