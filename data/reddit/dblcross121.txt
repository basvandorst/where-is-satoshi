Farmer has ordinary income for the sale of the egg.  The amount of income is equal to the average price of 1 BTC on the day of the transaction. This is also the same amount of the farmer's basis in the bitcoin he received. 
Boy has ordinary income for the sale of the lemonade.  The amount of income is equal to the average price of .5 BTC on the day of the transaction. This is also the same amount of the boy's basis in the bitcoin he received.

Are you using google chrome?  When I do it, I have to right click in the upper right hand corner of the first document that opens (there's a little PDF symbol there), and select "open in Adobe."  Then I decline the update that's offered, and it finally opens.  Convoluted I know.

This is not law, it's just a public notice of how the IRS interprets the law.  It is not entitled to much deference in Court, so it can certainly be challenged.  However, most people don't want to be the one litigating the notice.

Your question opens a large can of worms.  Normally, futures contracts are subject to the mark-to-market rules that basically eliminate the realization requirement.  However, its fairly clear that these rules do not apply to bitcoin futures (see section 1256).  Thus, I am not sure of the best way to tax bitcoin futures, to be honest.  I would have to do more research on the issue.  
Your second question is more straight forward.  That is because dividends are taxable to the recipient, so yes, you would owe taxes upon their distribution regardless of whether you sold them in the future.  The tax rate would depend on whether the dividends are "qualified dividends," which I would need more information to determine.

Thank you.  The capital gains in 2013 followed by total loss of funds in 2014 is certainly a very harsh result.  There is an interesting argument that the taxpayer never had constructive receipt of their gains after the last known MtGox cash withdrawal (which occurred sometime in July), so that might provide some relief for those who care to make it.

That's a good question.  The conclusion that foreign bitcoin exchange accounts are subject to FBAR reporting is not as strong when the account *never* contained USD.

Nice call on the statute of limitations issue, I definitely overlooked a few things.  
As for the foreign currency treatment, I guess that it is the "conservative approach" in that it results in a higher tax rate, which the IRS always like to see.  Of course if you had large losses, I'm guessing they would take issue with the characterization.  I've seen a lot of different CPAs say they are going to go with the foreign currency treatment, so you're not alone in that regard.

Yes, you offset losses and gains at the end of the year when figuring your total net gain or loss.  Just keep track of each individual transaction and your tax prep software will take care of the rest.

Actually a person who receives property as a gift is treated as having the same acquisition date as the person who gave it to them.  So, it's possible to sell it the next day and have long term capital gain, depending on the holding period of the original owner. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 15:10:49
I'm not sure why that person thinks you didn't open an account under your name with MtGox.  When you sent those funds to MtGox, you no doubt created an account (which was probably verified by sending in your personal information), and those funds were credited to that account.  You then  used MtGox's brokerage services to purchase bitcoins with those funds, which were then held in that account as well.  Eventually you transferred the bitcoins out of the account and into a paper wallet.  That is not analogous to a car dealership.  That is analogous to a brokerage account. 
In any case, there is no right or wrong answer here until we get official guidance from FinCEN. Myself and other attorneys I know consider it very likely that bitcoin accounts are subject to the FBAR requirement, others might disagree.  Regardless, those with MtGox accounts are in a vulnerable position and it might not be the best course of action for them to gamble on the FBAR requirements.

Qualified dividends receive capital gains treatment (i.e. 15% tax rate).  They have to be paid by a domestic corporation though, which I doubt the entity you're referring to would be.  
If you liquidated the stock, you would probably have realized gains.  Given that you are investing in bitcoin futures, your tax situation is particularly complex.  I would suggest seeking out a good CPA or tax attorney to prepare your taxes.

No, the *payor* is the one required to issue a 1099.  You are not required to file a 1099 in this situation because the transaction is not in the course of your trade or business (there are other reasons why you wouldn't file in this situation but aren't worth discussing).

I should clarify that part of the post.  The penalties apply only when a person has underreported his/her taxable income.  This is not possible with a basis of zero. Therefore, they would not have any penalties.

Sure.  It's still [Amount Realized] - [Basis].  IF the bitcoin is worth less, you'll have a smaller Amount Realized, which may result in a loss depending on basis. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 02:54:44
First point: yes, just keep good records of your bitcoin holdings. 
Second point: You've got the general idea correct.  The problem presented by bitcoin mining is how to match up expenses with income.  Allocating everything to basis - and foregoing a current deduction for depreciation on the mining rigs - is one possible solution.  I cannot say for certain whether it is correct (no one really can), but it doesn't strike me as unreasonable.  
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:54:00
Technically, the theoretical cup of coffee is a taxable transaction.  Whether you bother to report $0.50 of gain is of course up to you, just know that it is required by law.  
Obviously the purchase of something larger will have a greater amount of gain, in which case the impetus to report it becomes much greater.
In neither case is a 1099 required to be filed.

May I ask if your tax advisor is an attorney? 
There's room for disagreement of the application of the BSA and FACTA to bitcoin exchange accounts in certain circumstances, but I don't think any of the other tax attorneys  I've discussed this issue with would agree with your advisor in this case.  At the end of the day, you're the one on the hook not your advisor.  I would suggest obtaining a second opinion after a full discussion of the facts in your case.  
@_date: 2014-06-05 22:56:00
Very surprising.  However, I would caution that the notice does not say anything about bitcoin exchange accounts that held USD in excess of $10,000.  
Edit:  I should add that its not surprising as far as bitcoin holdings in a paper wallet are concerned.  But I would like to get official word from the IRS via a written notice before conlcuding that it intends to exclude exchange accounts from the filing requirements.

It's called the "kiddie tax." Basically, it requires your parents to recognize income to the extent that your tax bracket is smaller than theirs.  This is meant to keep parents from shifting income to their kids in order to pay less taxes.  
@_date: 2014-04-01 02:49:03
No, because you would end up in exactly the same position as before the gift.  This is  because your friend inherits your basis in the bitcoins, which you then inherit back from him.

@_date: 2014-01-04 04:14:06


I meant that it will compute your net gain after you input the details for each transaction (amount realized, basis, holding period).  
Note that the wash sale rules probably do not apply to bitcoins at this time.  You should consult directly with a tax professional on this point, but many commentators (including myself) do not believe that bitcoins are "shares in stock or securities." 
@_date: 2014-01-03 21:54:24
**.......Continued from Post Above.....**
**Topic 2: Recognition** 
** How do I calculate my gain or loss?** *
Gain or loss is calculated first on each bitcoin transaction, then on an aggregate basis by combining all your gains and losses to produce a net figure.  Your tax preparation software will automatically perform these calculations, so the actual mechanics aren't really necessary for you to understand.  However, you'll have to know the basics in order to enter the correct information into the software. 
Basically, gain or loss is computed by taking the sales price of each bitcoin and subtracting its cost.  The technical terms are “amount realized” and “basis.”  Although simple in concept, determining amount realized and basis can be quite complex, as we’ll see below.  
 
*Edit:  A good tool for calculating your gain or loss in bitcoin transactions is available for free at    
** What is my Basis?**  
Generally, basis is equal to cost.  So, if you purchase 1 BTC for $500, then your basis is $500.  You can also add to this amount any acquisition costs like broker commissions or wire transfer fees.   So, let's assume a 1% fee and a $5 wire transfer fee.  This would mean your basis is $500 + $5 + $5 = $510.00.  If you later sell that bitcoin for $900, your gain would be [$900] - [$510] = [$390]. 
** How do I determine my basis in each bitcoin?** *
If you’ve acquired bitcoins at different times and at different prices, determining basis can be quite complex.  This is because bitcoins are fungible.  Once a bitcoin is purchased, it becomes indistinguishable from the other bitcoins stored in the same wallet or account.  In a subsequent sale or exchange, there is no way to trace the cost or acquisition date of the bitcoin being transferred out.  
 
Contrary to what you might have heard, it is not acceptable to arbitrarily choose the bitcoin with the highest cost or most preferable tax impact.  The IRS requires you to use a system with rules that will produce a reasonable and consistent result.   The default system (and the one generally preferred by the IRS) is to assume that your bitcoins are sold in the order they were acquired.  Thus, the first bitcoin you purchase is assumed to be first bitcoin you sell.  This is called the FIFO method ("First in, First Out").   
There are some other methods available, such as LIFO ("Last In, First Out") and Average Cost Basis, but it’s not clear if bitcoins are eligible for these alternatives.   So, I would caution against using any system other than FIFO without guidance from a tax advisor or instructions from the IRS.  ~~Note: If bitcoins are classified as a foreign currency, then it becomes possible to use any method you want, as long as the chosen method is reasonable, you use it year-to-year, and it does not always give you the bitcoin with the highest cost available.  As discussed below, it is still uncertain whether bitcoins can qualify as a foreign currency, so again I must urge caution in deciding to take this position.~~ *Edit:  IRS Notice 2014-21 clarified that bitcoins are not a foreign currency for income tax purposes.*
 
I'll note that it's theoretically possible to avoid this problem altogether if you keep each and every bitcoin purchase in separate wallets or accounts.  This would allow you to trace the actual cost of each bitcoin you later sell or exchange, alleviating the need for the FIFO (or alternative) method.        
 
Either way, determining cost will require some detailed record keeping.  I will discuss record keeping in more detail below, but remember that the burden to prove basis is on you.  The IRS will not give you the benefit of the doubt here.  If you cannot prove the cost of each bitcoin, they will assume it was $0.  Obviously you don't want that to happen, so keep good records of your bitcoin purchases. 
** What if I mined my bitcoins, what is my basis then?**
 
IRS Notice 2014-21 clarifies the treatment for bitcoin miners.  Specifically, miners must recognize income for each bitcoin mined during the taxable year.  The amount of income is equal to the market price of bitcoin on the day it is awarded on the blockchain.  This also becomes the miner's basis in the bitcoin going forward and will be used to calculate gain/loss in the future when the bitcoin is sold.  
For example, assume you mine 1 bitcoin in 2013.  On the day it was mined, the market price of bitcoin was $1,000.  You have $1,000 of taxable income in 2013.  Going forward, your basis in the bitcoin is $1,000.  If you later sell the bitcoin for $1,200, you have a taxable gain of $1,200 - $1,000 = $200.  See below for the character of this gain. 
You mining expenses, such as electricity, would not be included into basis.  Instead, they would be deductible in the taxable year as an expense.  Miners will need to determine if their mining activity rises to the level of a trade or business, which is a highly factual determination. 
~~This is a very difficult question to answer with any degree of certainty.  The problem is that bitcoin mining is a completely unique activity that yields an even more unique  product.   To reach an answer, one must resolve some difficult tax issues.  Namely, what is bitcoin mining and how do we classify the bitcoins it produces?~~  
~~Unfortunately, addressing these two issues would be a lengthy and detailed post in itself, so I cannot fully address them here.   Suffice it to say that bitcoin miners will need a very competent tax advisor to make sure their gains are properly reported.~~
~~Not to leave you without any guidance whatsoever, the answer will most likely depend on the size and scope of your mining activity.  Large scale miners should probably treat themselves as a manufacturing business, and the bitcoins they produce as inventory held for sale to customers.  Such bitcoin miners would not determine their gains in the same manner as normal investors.  They would compute income at the end of the year by figuring their  total sales and then subtracting "cost of goods sold."  The latter would take into account the cost of producing bitcoins, such as electricity.  Other expenses, like depreciation on the mining rig, would presumably be deductible as an ordinary business expenses.  Obviously this implicates some complex accounting rules that are far beyond this post.  A tax advisor with some knowledge of these rules would be needed to accurately determine your tax liability.~~  
 
~~Smaller mining operations  can probably get away with treating their mining as an "activity for the production of income," as opposed to a manufacturing business.  In such a case, they would follow the same rules for determining gain or loss as normal investors.  I suspect their basis in this case would be determined by allocating their mining costs on a pro rata basis, assuming they can reasonably track and allocate such expenses (like electricity).   The safest and most conservative approach, on the other hand, would be to use a basis of zero.   Depreciation and other indirect expenses would likely be deductible as an itemized expense, similar to a general investor (see below).~~  
~~I must emphasize that neither of these treatments is a perfect fit.  I expect different tax advisors to reach different conclusions on the correct treatment.  The goal in any case is to use the best method of matching income to expenses, whatever that is.  Presumably the IRS will respect your chosen method as long as you can convincingly argue that it is the best at accomplishing this goal.~~    
 
** What if I received my bitcoins as payment, what is my basis then?** 
If you sell goods or services and accept bitcoin as payment, your basis in those bitcoins is equal their fair market value at the time they were received.  Generally, this is determined by reference to the average market price on that day.  Thus, if you wrote a software program for someone and received 1 BTC as payment on November 1st, your basis in those bitcoins is equal to the average price of 1 BTC on that day.  
The choice of which exchange to use for this purpose (e.g. Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, etc.) is up to you.  Whichever exchange you choose,  you should have a reasonable explanation for your choice.  You should also stick with that choice when computing your gains in the future.    Arbitrarily picking exchange prices that best suit your tax interests will not be acceptable to the IRS in a subsequent audit. 
** What if I received my bitcoins as a gift, what is my basis then?** *
It depends.  Generally, you inherit the basis of anything given to you as a gift.  This means you would take the same basis as the friend who gave you the bitcoins.  However, an important exception applies if the friend’s basis was more than the market value of the bitcoins at the time of the gift (i.e. the bitcoins had a built in loss).
In that case, you would wait to determine your basis until you sell or exchange the gifted bitcoins in the future.   When the time comes, you would use the following rules: 
* First, calculate your gain/loss using your friend’s basis.  
* If this results in a gain, then the default rule applies and nothing changes.     
* If this results in a loss, however, then you do not inherit your friend’s basis.  Instead, you must use the market value of the bitcoins on the date of the gift and recalculate your gains/loss.   
* After recalculating, you must check if you still have a loss.  If yes, then proceed with using the market value as your basis.  However, if the recalculation results in a gain, then the tax law says to ignore the gain and report nothing.  To be clear, you have no gain or loss in this situation.  
Now that last point might confuse many readers, so here is an example to demonstrate.   Assume you received bitcoins worth $750 at the time of the gift.  Your friend’s basis was $1000.  This triggers the exception discussed above and you have to wait until you sell the bitcoins in the future to determine your basis.  Consider three alternative sale prices: 
* Sale Price = $1200.  Using your friend’s basis of $1000, this creates a gain of $200.  Therefore, you inherit your friend’s basis and have a realized gain of $200.  No problem.  
* Sales Price = $600.  Using your friend’s basis of $1000, this creates a loss of $400.  Therefore, you cannot inherit your friend’s basis.   Instead, you must use the value of the bitcoins on the date of the gift, which was $750.  Therefore, you have a loss of $150.  No Problem.  
* Sales Price of $900.  Using your friend’s basis of $1000, this creates a loss of $100.  Therefore, you cannot use your friend’s basis.  Instead, you must recalculate your gain/loss using the value of bitcoin on the date of the gift.  Now you have a gain of $150.  Therefore, you disregard the sale and have no gain or loss to report.  
This is a perplexing tax treatment.  It might help to think of this rule as preventing your friend from shifting bitcoin losses to your tax return.  This is why you get to inherit his basis only if it would create a gain on the subsequent sale.  If not, then the amount of his loss is extinguished and you get to recognize only the amount of loss that accrued after the gift occurred.  This also explains why you would have no gain or loss if the market price of bitcoin has increased since the time of the gift but is still less than your friend’s original basis.    
In any case, when receiving bitcoins as a gift, make sure to ask the person what his or her basis was in the bitcoin, as well as their acquisition date (which you always inherit).   Lastly, write down the date of the gift and the market price of bitcoins on that day.  
~~ ** How do I determine  Amount Realized (i.e. Sales Price)?** 
This depends on the transaction and if you sold bitcoins for cash or exchanged them for goods/services.  
In the case of a sale, amount realized is equal to sales price, less any selling costs you incur in the transaction (like commissions or wire transfer fees).  So, if you sell a bitcoin for $900 and incur a 1% transaction fee, your amount realized is $900 - $9 = $891.00.  
If you exchanged bitcoins for goods or services (instead of selling them), then amount realized is more complicated.  This is essentially a barter transaction, where the default rule is to use the fair market value of the goods or services received in the exchange.  For example, if you purchased a laptop on November 29th with bitcoins, your amount realized would be equal to the Fair Market Value of the laptop on that date.  The easiest way to determine Fair Market Value is by reference to the sales price, although an alternative method can be used if yields a more accurate value.  
Presumably, the sales price of most goods or services will be denominated in dollars (even though payment is made in bitcoin).  Thus, if the laptop's price was $1,500, you can safely assume that it's FMV was also $1,500. If the sales price is denominated in bitcoin (instead of dollars), you'll have to convert it into dollars using the average exchange price on that day.  As mentioned above, the choice of which exchange to use for this purpose (e.g. Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, etc.) is up to you.  The most conservative option would be to use the price from the exchange that you purchased the bitcoin in the first place.  Whichever exchange you choose,  you should have a reasonable explanation for your choice.  You should also stick with that choice when computing your gains in the future.    Arbitrarily picking exchange prices that best suit your tax interests will not be acceptable to the IRS in a subsequent audit. 
**TL; DR:** Gain is determined by subtracting basis from amount realized.  Basis is generally equal to cost, but special rules must be followed (such as FIFO) if your bitcoins are mixed together.  Amount realized is generally equal to sales price.  If goods or property were received instead of cash, then amount realized is equal to the FMV of the property received.

Both.  It is generally advisable to gift appreciated property rather than cash for the very reason you just identified:  the donor gets to avoid paying tax on the appreciation. 
Note that the recipient *generally* inherits the basis of the donor, so this is more of a tax delay than a tax avoidance.

Any bitcoin exchange that offers an exportable spreadsheet would have a significant leg up on such an app.

You aren't the only one, unfortunately.  The IRS expects people who don't know their basis to make a reasonable and good faith effort of determining it.  If it's really impossible, the safest bet is to use $0.  A good tax preparer might be able to help you figure something out.  Good luck.

Just stopping by to say this is correct.  
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:36:12
Well for instance you could use coinbase, and as long as you have a zero balance there, any transfers into coinbase for the purposes of selling would still be traceable. 
My point in the comment above had more to do with keeping a wallet for "transactions" which contains bitcoins purchased at more recent prices.  This would allow someone with low-basis coins to avoid having to recognize large gains when using bitcoins as a payment method.

I should've clarified that "everyone" refers to other tax professionals who comment on bitcoin tax issues. Many of us hoped for foreign currency treatment, but didn't really expect to happen at this early juncture.
The IRS notice is just an interpretation of the law, it is by no means final.  The next step is to start developing regulations, which are based on public comment.  So, there is still plenty of opportunity shape the taxation of bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-26 22:16:36
There's no specific ruling on the proper method for bitcoins.  So, we have to look at other types of assets for guidance, where the availability of LIFO is generally quite restricted.  Therefore, it's reasonable to assume that it will be the same case for bitcoins. It's not advisable to use LIFO because you could end up having to pay significant taxes plus penalties and interest in the future. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 03:47:06
You file during April with your regular tax return.  The quarterly requirement you referred to has to do with the payment of estimated taxes.  This usually isn't a problem because of the witholding on your paycheck.  However, if you have extra income in the form of capital gains, you might be required to make additional estimated tax payments.  This will depend on your particular tax situation, so you should ask your CPA or tax preparer.  Generally, if this is the first year you have increased income from capital gains, you won't have a problem.  But, you should double check with a tax professional to be sure. 
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:34:46

I should've said "money" not currency.  The notice you sight is of limited application to miners and doesn't provide any guidance on this issue.  However, the director of FinCEN testified in Congress back in November and said the official position is that current regulatory authority encompassed Bitcoin transactions.  
At the end of the day, it's really just semantics anyways.  Whether bitcoins are "property" or "currency" doesn't really change the nature of the deposit account at MtGox and the brokerage services provided there, which under most interpretations falls under the Bank Secrecy Act's FBAR requirement.  
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:37:29
In theory, a person who has lost bitcoins would be allowed a casualty loss.  However, that loss would be equal to the amount of his or her basis (so it would probably be much less than millions of dollars).  There are some tests that must be met for casualty losses, though, so you'd need to consult with a tax professional with your exact situation.

I'm not really sure I follow your example.  I haven't heard of stocks that issue dividends in the form of cryptocurrencies. 
In any case, it sounds like you do not know your basis in the bitcoins/cryptocurrencies you currently own.  The safest option is to just assume it is zero, which will obviously result in you paying more tax than you should.  The second option is to take your best guess, whatever that is.  As long as you make a good faith effort, you can avoid penalties if you're subsequently audited.

However, despite it's non-traditional appearance, MtGox provided *very* traditional financial services.  In particular, MtGox provided deposit accounts for fiat and brokerage services for Bitcoins.

@_date: 2014-01-04 02:41:23
Your example implicates the issue of matching expenses and income.  That is why the purchase of bitcoin is not a deductible expense.  You will have to wait until the bitcoin is sold in the future, at which time you can subtract the cost from the sales price.  This is the basic principle of calculating gain/loss. 
The cost of the minding hardware is a much more complicated question.  Generally, the purchase of equipment cannot be deducted all at once.  Instead, it must be spread out over a number of years (this is called depreciation and reflects the issue of matching expenses with income).  There are certain exceptions that would apply if the mining activity qualifies as an actual business.  I would suggest you consult with a tax professional to make sure you get the treatment right.  
Incorporation generally has nothing to do with this issue.

Thanks for your comment.  The rules for wash sales are provided under section 1091 of the IRC and specifically address only "shares of stock or securities."   Therefore, they would apply only if bitcoins are a share of stock or a security.
Since I don't think anyone can argue that bitcoins are a share of stock, the determination rests on whether bitcoins are "securities."  Unfortunately, section 1091 does not provide us with a definition of "securities. " So we have to look at other code sections for an idea of what it means.  One code section, Section 1236, defines a security as "any share of stock in any corporation, certificate of stock or interest in any corporation, note, bond, debenture, or evidence of indebtedness, or any evidence of an interest in or right to subscribe to or purchase any of the foregoing."  Bitcoins would not appear to meet this definition.  Other code sections use similar definitions, including tax court decisions on matters involving the meaning of "securities."  Therefore, without some action by Congress or the IRS, I do not see how bitcoins would be subject to section 1091.  Perhaps there is something I am overlooking, though.  
I suspect that the accountant and Greg Broiles are speaking more to the fact that bitcoin *should* be subject to the wash sale rules.  I do not disagree in that regard.  However, until bitcoins are brought within the definition of "shares of stock" or "securities,"  that is not technically the case.

**.......Continued from Post Above.....**
**Topic 5: Deductions** *
~~ ** What kind of expenses can I deduct as an investor?** * 
You are permitted to deduct investment related expenses as an "itemized deduction."  However, this deduction is fairly meaningless for most investors.  This is because you must actually itemize your deductions instead of taking the standard deduction, which many taxpayers do not.  Additionally, such expenses fall within the category of "miscellaneous itemized deduction," which are only deductible to the extent they exceed 2% of your Adjusted Gross Income.   The 2% floor is particularly troublesome because most “miscellaneous itemized deductions” are pretty insignificant, particularly investment related expenses.   Recall that you've already accounted for commissions and wire transfer fees in determining "amount realized" and "basis."  Your remaining expenses might include: 
* Interest paid on funds that you borrowed in order to invest (limited to the amount of your net gains),
* Rent expense for a safety deposit box (this could arguably be extended to include the cost USB drives for cold storage),
* Consulting fees for the tax treatment of bitcoin,
* Depreciation on equipment used in the production of income, such as your computer (however, you'll have to allocate the cost of the equipment between personal use and investment use, which is likely to reduce this deduction substantially in most cases).  
In most cases, these deductions will be quite small.  Other expenses may or may not be available to you, depending on your specific situation, though.  You should consult with your tax advisor to be certain of your deductible expenses.   There are also a myriad of resources online if you have questions about what kinds of expenses are deductible by investors. 
~~ ** kind of expenses can I deduct as a miner?**
If your mining operation is substantial and continuous enough to be considered an actual business, then you can deduct all of your ordinary and necessary expenses.   This would include the cost of electricity and depreciation on your mining rig, among others.  If your mining operation is not substantial or continuous, you would deduct expenses like an ordinary investor. 
As mentioned above, the tax treatment of bitcoin miners is exceptionally uncertain.   So, its important that you obtain the advice of a tax professional with regards to whether or not your activity rises to the level of a trade or business.   
**Topic 6: Record Keeping** *
~~ ** What kinds of records should I keep?** 
You are required to maintain records sufficient for determining the amount of your gain or loss, as well as the holding period of your bitcoins.  This is a flexible standard and depends on the circumstances.  Ideally, you should maintain a log of all your bitcoin acquisitions and dispositions, including the price, date, and related address of each transaction.   Many exchanges make this information available to you in the form of a downloadable spreadsheet.    
 
~~ ** How long should I keep my records?** *
The IRS can generally go back and audit your tax returns for a period of 3 years.  That period is extended to 6 years if your tax return omitted more than 25% of your income.  Finally, there is no time limit if you are charged with civil fraud or never filed your tax returns.   Thus, it is advisable that you save your records for at least three years after filing your tax return, although you might consider keeping them at least six years to be safe.
~~ ** What if I don't maintain records?** 
You are required by law to maintain records, so failing to do so will result in civil penalties if you are subsequently audited *and* owe additional tax.  This means that if you have no records of your bitcoin purchases/acquisitions, you might consider claiming a zero basis and characterize your gains as short-term if you want to avoid penalties.   This makes sure you’ve paid the maximum amount of tax possible on your gains, and hence there cannot be any additional tax to which a penalty can attach.  
Penalties aside, it is in your best interest to maintain records because the burden is on you to prove your basis.  Thus, if you cannot reasonably establish your purchase price, the IRS will assume it is zero.  The same goes for holding period (which would cause you to lose the benefit of the lower long term capital gains rate).  
 
This assumption can be disastrous if you engage in a lot of bitcoin transactions.  For example, consider a day trader who buys $2,000 worth of bitcoins after seeing a specific market signal, which he then sells shortly after for a small profit of $100.  He does this once per day.  If he is subsequently audited and lacks the necessary documentation to prove his basis, the IRS will assume it was zero.  Thus, he would be taxable on $2,100 of gain every single day, instead of just $100.  That is a total taxable gain of $766,500 for the year, compared to $36,500if he had kept adequate records.   In addition, he would be subject to penalties on top of the additional tax.
**Topic 7: Foreign account reporting** 
The requirements to report foreign accounts are complex and convoluted, such that many taxpayers and tax preparers overlook them entirely.  However, the penalties for doing so are severe - even criminal in some cases.  Therefore, I feel compelled to address the reporting requirements for foreign accounts even though I rarely see any questions on this issue. 
 
~~ ** What are the foreign account reporting requirements?** 
There are two separate reporting requirements under federal law, each created by a different statute (The Bank Secrecy Act and the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act).   Although the exact wording is different between the two statutes, they generally require reporting of financial accounts held at foreign financial institutions.  Whether bitcoin wallets and exchange accounts fall meet the definitions for these terms is debatable.  
~~ ** Do the reporting requirements apply to bitcoins kept in paper wallets?** *
Probably not.   It's pretty difficult to imagine that a paper wallet containing your bitcoins would qualify as a “financial account” held at “foreign financial institution”.  Thus, it’s fairly safe to assume that paper wallets are not subject to the reporting requirements.
 
~~ ** What about accounts at a foreign bitcoin exchanges (such as Mt. Gox or BTC-e)?** *
These are probably subject to the reporting requirements.  The answer basically depends on whether foreign bitcoin exchanges are "foreign financial institutions," and whether an account with one of them is indeed a "financial account." 
Unfortunately, an analysis of the specific meanings of these terms and the myriad of regulations that apply is too large of a task for this post.  However, I will say that the definitions for these terms are exceptionally broad and you would have a hard time arguing that foreign bitcoin exchange accounts are not covered by the reporting requirements.  After all, they accept deposits of fiat and provide brokerage services, which are traditional characteristics of a financial accounts and financial institutions.  
In any case, it’s advisable to err on the side of caution here.  As you'll see below, the penalties for failing to file foreign account disclosures are tremendously harsh, so it’s likely that you’re better off assuming that you should report such accounts (subject to the minimum balance requirements)  until told otherwise.  At the very least, you should consult with a tax attorney if you have a foreign bitcoin account with a balance higher than the minimum thresholds discussed below.  There are many complex strategy considerations here that an attorney can help you navigate.
** What about e-wallet accounts (such as blockchain.info)?** *
These are probably not subject to the reporting requirements, although it depends on the nature of your account.  The most important factor is whether you give custody of your bitcoins to the e-wallet provider.  If you do, then your e-wallet probably qualifies as a “deposit account,” which would bring it within the reporting requirements.  Of course, there is still the question of whether the e-wallet provider is a “financial institution,” but given the extremely broad definitions used by the BSA and FACTA, it’s probably fair to assume that any business accepting deposits on behalf of customers is a “financial institution” – even deposits of bitcoins.  Therefore, e-wallet accounts that take custody of your bitcoins are likely subject to the reporting requirements.  
On the other hand, if you maintain control of the e-wallet and the provider has no access to your bitcoins, then it’s unlikely your e-wallet is a “financial account.”  Without a financial account, you cannot be subject to the reporting requirements. 
A good test for whether your account is custodial or noncustodial is to check if you are given a personal key for the wallet.  Most custodial e-wallets do not provide you with a personal key, meaning that you must request a transfer of your bitcoin, which they then execute.  A noncustodial e-wallet, on the other hand, gives you the personal key and you can transfer bitcoins out of the wallet without any interaction with the e-wallet provider.  They have no access to your bitcoins and essentially just generate a valid wallet address for you without keeping any control over your account.  Therefore, it would be unlikely that they are maintaining an account on your behalf.
Again, though, I must emphasize an abundance of caution here.  If your e-wallet account is greater than the minimum thresholds, you should consider talking with a knowledgeable attorney to make sure you are not subject to the reporting requirements.  
~~ ** What is the minimum account balance for reporting the reporting requirements?** 
Remember there are two separate reporting requirements.  The first arises under the Bank Secrecy Act and has a minimum account threshold of $10,000. The test if whether the total aggregate value of all your foreign accounts exceeds $10,000 at any point during the year.  If so, you must report the highest balance for each account by filing an FBAR with the IRS.  This form is filed separate from your income tax return and must be received by June 30th of each year.  
 
The second filing requirement arises under the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act (FACTA).  This requirement has a minimum threshold of $75,000 during the year, except for the last day of the year when it is lowered to $50,000.  Thus, if the aggregate value of your accounts is less than $75,000 during the year, you will still have to report them if their value is greater than $50,000 on December 31st.   The reporting is done by filing a Form 8928 with your income tax return.  This form reports the highest balance of each account during the year.  Note: this is in addition to the FBAR filing.  
  
~~ ** What is the penalty for failing to file an FBAR?** 
The penalty for failure to file an FBAR under the BSA varies depending on "willfulness."  If your failure to file was not willful, the penalty is capped $10,000.  If your failure was willful, the penalty is the greater of $100,000 or 50% of the highest account balance for each account.   Criminal penalties can also apply.    
Willfulness is defined generally as the intentional disregard of a known legal duty.  The IRS will typically asserts willfulness if you fail to file FBARs in multiple years.  Otherwise, the determination will depend on your knowledge, sophistication, and experience as an investor.  
~~ ** What is the penalty for failing to file a Form 8938?** 
The penalty for failing to file a Form 8938 with your tax return is an automatic $10,000.00, increased up to $60,000 if you fail to file after receiving notice from the IRS.  Criminal penalties may also apply.  
At the end of the day, the penalties for both the FBAR and Form 8938 are severe.  It is not worth the risk of failing to file these forms, just as it is not worth the risk of failing to report your gains. 
The taxation of bitcoins presents some complicated questions.  I hope my answers have been helpful, although I expect they probably generate more questions than they answer.  Such is the nature of most tax discussions, though.  Please feel free to ask any other questions, I'll do my best to answer them.

Money laundering is outside my area (its more of a white collar criminal thing) and the rules are quite complex.  Generally, though, honest profits from bitcoin would not implicate money laundering issues.  My point in the post, though, is that large money transfers can trigger an i*nvestigation*.

**Continued from Above**
** How long should I wait to repurchase after selling my bitcoins for a loss?**
Unfortunately, there is no clear answer to this question.  Traditionally, the amount of time required to pass in order for a transaction to gain "economic substance" depended on the volatility of the market. The more volatile, the less time was needed.  And visa-versa.  
It goes without saying that bitcoin is an extremely volatile asset, so we can probably safely assume that you do not need to wait very long.  30 days (which is the requirement under Section 1091 for wash sales of stocks and securities) is certainly long enough, but would essentially defeat the point.  Conversely, waiting only a matter of minutes is almost as certainly not long enough.  
So, where does the magic number lie?  It's impossible to say for certain.  One day is definitely on the low end and probably the shortest amount of time that you could conceivably get away with (but it would still be quite risky).  I would tend to think something in the three to five day range is more appropriate, with a week or more being a safer choice for those who want to eliminate the risk of the economic substance doctrine as much as possible.  At the end of the day, the decision is up to you --  just keep in mind that longer is better.  
*Example: Instead of immediately repurchasing the bitcoins he sold, Bob from the previous example waits five days to make the repurchase.  In the mean time, the price of bitcoin fluctuates 5% each day, but ends up at almost the exact same price that he sold them.  Bob repurchases the same amount of bitcoin at this price.  If Bob were audited, he would have a strong argument that the transaction did not lack economic substance because he exposed himself to the market risk of bitcoin, regardless of the fact that he was able to repurchase at the same price five days later.* 
** Should I use wash sales to generate losses by the end of the year?**
Maybe.  Typically the strategy of "taking losses" is used to offset gains that you might've had on other investments during the year.  In that case, using a wash sale to generate losses could help reduce your taxes considerably.  
On the other hand, a wash sale essentially resets your cost basis and holding period.  By that I mean you now own the bitcoin at the new purchase price and the new purchase date.  So, you'll have to weigh the possibility of higher capital gains in the future, as well as the possibility of losing long-term status,   against the current year tax savings.  
At the end of the day, losses on bitcoins are treated just the same as losses on shares of stock, with one exception: the wash sale rules of Section 1091 do not apply.   Regardless, a wash sale lacking economic substance can be invalidated by the IRS, so it's a good idea to wait at least a few of days before repurchasing. 
I'll try to answer any questions, but keep in mind this is general information only and not legal advice.

The conclusion that foreign bitcoin exchange accounts are subject to FBAR reporting is not as strong when the account never contained USD.

As it stands, that is not the case.  Thus, my post reflects the correct way to report income tax on bitcoin gains.  
@_date: 2014-03-27 01:27:00
That's an interesting question.  There's no correct answer and it highlights the flaw in the IRS's ruling.  You'd have to take a best guess at valuing the coins, perhaps by relating the price back from the date it was added to the exchange (with a reasonable discount for the time difference).
@_date: 2014-01-22 18:46:55
Yes, assuming the bitcoin has appreciated in value since you purchased it. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 15:08:42
There's a FinCEN ruling on that issue, miners are generally not MSBs.
@_date: 2014-03-31 20:40:36
Good question.  There is ultimately no difference in tax consequences between these transactions.  In each case, bitcoin is being exchanged for property, which triggers taxation.  The amount of the tax would be determined subtracting the original cost from your "amount realized."  
1. Coinbase:  Amount realized equals the sales price. 
2. Gyft:  Amount realized equals the value of the gift card. 
3. Bitcoin Store: Amount realized equals the value of the computer. 
Assuming the sales price, gift card value, and computer price are all the same, the tax would also be the same. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:27:05
You will net your gains and losses against each other at the end of the year (the actual computation is a little messy because of the difference between long term and short term capital gains, but your tax prep software will do it automatically).   So, just keep track of each transaction and it won't actually be as bad as you think.

Ok fine, I'll bite.  You didn't provide any compelling counter argument in the first place that I needed to refute.  Your focus on whether bitcoins are indeed "property" as opposed to "currency" and continued reference to a FinCEN notice dealing with the categorization of Money Service Businesses indicates that you yourself are lacking in regulatory knowledge.  
In any case, my point with this post is not to spiral down some overly technical discussion of FinCEN definitions, but is instead to point out that myself and a number of other attorneys I know who practice this area of the law have considered this issue and determined that a strong argument exists in favor of applying the FBAR reporting requirements.  Its not 100% certain, nothing ever is.  But because MtGox holders in particular are now in a vulnerable position, it might not be wise to cling to narrow or technical interpretations of the FBAR requirements.  You may very well find yourself litigating those in court if you choose to take that approach.

Interesting.  I'm not making any special offers or soliciting business, so I'm honestly a bit surprised to see your comment.  I'd be happy to undergo whatever verification process the mods of this sub feel is appropriate.  
In any case, you're right that no one *knows* whether FinCEN considers bitcoin accounts at foreign exchanges to be within the FBAR filing requirements.  That's because FinCEN hasn't directly addressed the issue.   However, a number of respected attorneys besides myself have reached the same conclusion on this issue.  That is based not only on the very broad terminology employed by the Bank Secrecy Act, but also testimony by the director of FinCEN before Congress back in Novemeber, during which he said that bitcoin transactions fall within the regulatory authority of FinCEN.  
I made this post to make people aware of the risk they face thanks to the collapse of MtGox.  That's not FUD.  My goal was also not to write a lengthy analysis full of legal citations, which very few people would read.

It does not appear that the wash sale rules apply to bitcoins.  The statute specifically applies to "Shares of stock and securities," which arguably does not include bitcoins.  That doesn't mean the IRS won't try to enforce them.

Yes I tend to agree that certainty is a good think when it comes to Wallstreet.

You might be thinking of the wash sales rules, which do not currently apply to bitcoins.  Using your example, the person would have a gain of $1,000 on the sale.  Then he or she would now own bitcoins with a basis of $500.  The two transactions are not related for tax purposes.

Interesting, I'd like to learn more about that feature.
@_date: 2014-01-04 00:24:50
Actually a log prepared at a time that is contemporaneous with the transaction would be considered fairly persuasive by the IRS.  It's not a slam dunk, but it would still get you somewhere.

In your example, I am inclined to think that the Mr. Gox and Coinbase bitcoin have not been comingled.  Thus, they are still traceable and the person can treat the sale of bitcoin on coinbase as separate from any bitcoin on Mt. Gox.  However, this is not a resolved issue.

A tip in this context is arguably gratuitous, which makes it a gift.  You are permitted to gift up to ~$14,000 (the amount changes each year for inflation) per person per year tax free.  So, there is no recognition here. 
Note that not all tips are gifts, so it will depend on the circumstances.

Nothing changes.  There would presumably be a deduction available for the interest paid on the borrowed money, though.

Just your taxes (you'd have $799 of taxable gain).

Part 1 is correct.
Part 2 is pretty much incorrect.  The gain on bitcoins is still taxable.  Your analogy to credit card rewards is interesting, but not technically accurate.  Note that it took years for the IRS to resolve the question of whether credit card rewards are taxable, and you can bet that the credit card company's spent a good deal of money lobbying for the eventual outcome (not-taxable).  Now if only we had someone to lobby on behalf of bitcoin...

I've seen a response from them saying that they are not going to issue 1099s, so I think the answer is no.  Obviously that can change at any moment.  They are still subject to reporting requirements under FinCEN though (for potential money laundering activities).

You're absolutely correct.  As I mentioned in my post, the taxation of bitcoin as a non-currency is the biggest threat to its future.

**.......Continued from Post Above.....**
**Topic 3  Character**
~~ ** Are my gains "capital gains?"** 
Probably.  The first hurdle to clear is the classification of bitcoins as a capital asset, because capital gains treatment applies only to capital assets.   This is actually a pretty easy hurdle to clear because the definition of a capital asset includes all forms of property  by default, unless specifically excluded.  So, if you look at the list of excluded property under § 1221(a) of the code, you'll see that bitcoins are not excluded by name, nor would they fall within any of the excluded categories.  (keep in mind that this is not true if bitcoins are held as inventory in a trade or business, which might be the case if you mine bitcoins, nor is it true if bitcoins are classified as a self-created intangible asset like a copyright or artistic composition, which is unlikely but possible).
Thus, bitcoins are a capital asset in the hands of most taxpayers and qualify for capital gains treatment.  If you were lucky enough to buy your bitcoins more than a year ago, then your gains would qualify for the lower preferential tax rate given to long term capital gains (probably 15%, but it depends on your income level).  
If you held you bitcoins for one year or less, then the gains are characterized as short term capital gains, which are taxed at ordinary income tax rates (i.e. the same rate as your paycheck).  
~~Note that a different characterization would apply if bitcoins are treated as a foreign currency.  Whether bitcoins will be so treated is uncertain, but if you're curious, read the answer below.~~  *Edit: IRS Notice 2014-21 concluded that bitcoins are not foreign currency.*
 
~~ ** What if I mined my bitcoins?** 
IRS Notice 2014-21 clarified that bitcoin miners have income in the year the bitcoin is mined.  The notice is silent as to the character of this income, but it is probably ordinary.  
When the miner later sells the bitcoin, the gain is also taxable.  The character of that gain is probably capital for the reasons discussed above.  However, if your mining activity rises to the level of a "trade or business" and you bitcoins can be considered as "inventory held for sale to customers," than the gain is ordinary income.     
Whether your bitcoins are "inventory" depends on the facts and circumstances of your particular situation. Generally, if you sell bitcoins to an exchange, your bitcoins are probably not inventory. If you sell them to a specific person or list of persons/companies, then it's possible they are inventory.  I suggest consulting with a competent tax advisor to determine whether your activity is a "trade or business" and whether your bitcoins are "inventory held for sale to customers."  
*edited to reflect IRS 2014-21*
~~ ** What if I'm a "day trader?"** 
Generally, the tax treatment for day traders is the same as a regular investor.  Of course there are exceptions to this rule, such as the mark-to-market regime, but they would not apply to bitcoins without some affirmative directive by the IRS.    
There is also the possibility of your day-trading activities rising to the level of an actual business (which would make your gains and losses "ordinary.")    The IRS is extremely stingy when it comes to classifying day-traders in this manner, though, so it's unlikely you have anything to worry about here.   However, you should consult with a  tax advisor to be sure about your status. 
 
~~ ** What if Bitcoins are classified as a collectible?** 
As a collectible, the gains would still be "capital gains," but the lower tax rate given to long term capital gains would be fixed at 28% (instead of the 15% most taxpayers would use).  However, it's pretty unlikely at this point that bitcoins would be classified as a collectible.  First, bitcoins are not specifically named in the code section that defines "collectibles."  Second, collectibles are traditionally limited to tangible assets, whereas bitcoins are intangible assets.  (Note: there might be an argument that physical bitcoins, such as those made by Casacius, are "collectibles."  However, that would still require some declaration by the IRS or Congres to make certain).  Thus, for now, it's safe to conclude that bitcoins are not a collectible and regular long-term capital gains treatment applies.  *Note: IRS Notice 2014-21 is silent as to this issue.*
~~ ** What if bitcoins are treated as a foreign currency?** 
*Edit:  IRS Notice 2014-21 clarifies that bitcoins are not a foreign currency.* 
As a foreign currency,  bitcoins would be disqualified from capital gains treatment  (even though still technically a capital asset).  In other words,  all bitcoin  gains would be taxable at ordinary income tax rates regardless of holding period.  Although this sounds like bad news for bitcoin investors, there are  some caveats that arguably outweigh the negatives of this outcome .  
The biggest is the exception under the foreign currency rules for "personal transactions."  Under this exception, gains of less than $200 are tax free as long as the transaction is not for investment or business purposes.   Remember that without this exception, every exchange of bitcoins for goods or services would trigger taxable gain, which creates a significant burden on the use of bitcoin for day-to-day transactions.   Thus, this exception is a potential game changer for the future of bitcoin.  Assuming that most consumer transactions would generate less than $200 of gain, there would be no tax consequences to the use of bitcoin for personal spending.   The implications of this outcome cannot be overstated. 
If the gains are greater than $200 (on personal transactions), they are no longer tax free.  However, instead of being taxed as ordinary income, the code allows them to be treated as capital gains instead.  Thus, the gains would be eligible for the lower tax rate given to long-term capital gains .   Although not as significant as the $200 exemption mentioned above, this still offers a benefit to consumers who use bitcoin for day-to-day personal transactions.  
Just to be clear, any gains on non-personal transactions would be ordinary income.   So, investors would lose the lower tax rate given to long-term capital gains.  However, this isn't as bad as it sounds.  First, many investors - particularly day traders - do not hold bitcoin for longer than one-year anyways, so their tax rate is effectively unchanged.  Second, because they are no longer "capital," bitcoin losses would be fully deductible (i.e. not subject to the $3,000 limitation discussed below).  Finally, investors stand to benefit indirectly from the $200 exemption mentioned above.  That is because this exemption should help propel the  wide spread use of bitcoin, is likely to be the greatest catalyst for future market appreciation.    
~~ ** So, are bitcoins foreign currency?** 
*Edit:  IRS Notice 2014-21 clarifies that bitcoins are not a foreign currency.* 
It is impossible to say at this point whether bitcoins are a foreign currency for purposes of income taxation.   No US court has directly addressed this issue, nor has the IRS published any guidance . The closest we've come is an obscure federal court decision written by a Magistrate judge involving bank fraud chargers (which has nothing to do with taxation) and a ruling by FinCen that bitcoin is not a currency.  However, the FinCen ruling uses an extremely narrow definition of currency that has no application whatsoever to the issue of taxation.   
Thus, bitcoin users and tax professionals are left to guess as to it's proper classification.  The conservative approach is to treat bitcoin as a normal capital asset until some further guidance is issued by the IRS.  This is consistent with the general attitude towards bitcoin expressed by the IRS, as well as some notable legal scholarship on the issue.  When dealing with uncertainties such as this, it is generally advisable to proceed with the most cautious option available, which would be treating bitcoin as a capital asset (not a foreign currency).  
This is not to say that you would be without a basis for treating bitcoin as a foreign currency.  Indeed,  bitcoins are intended to serve as a medium exchange and lack any other functional purpose.  Unlike gold, silver or other commodities that have served as currency in the past, bitcoins do not have any industrial or commercial usefulness aside from exchange.  This arguably makes them much more similar to a currency than a commodity or other capital asset. 
Of course, the fact that bitcoins are not minted by any foreign government or bank casts some doubt as to whether they are truly foreign.  However, the internal revenue code does not employ the term foreign currency.  It distinguishes currency as being functional or nonfunctional.  Further, it declares that only the US dollar can be a functional currency.  Thus, the fact that bitcoin is not produced by a foreign government is not actually relevant, because any currency that is not the US dollar is automatically a non-functional currency and therefore subject to the foreign currency rules.  
In the end, the decision of whether to treat bitcoins as a foreign currency is up to you (and your tax advisor).  The trouble is that the IRS could subsequently try to undo your elected treatment and assess the additional tax that would  result.  Of course, it's possible that the IRS will ultimately agree with your  treatment of bitcoin as a foreign currency, in which case you would not be at any risk by adopting the treatment early.  I wish I could provide a more concrete recommendation here, but at this point it's just too uncertain.  
**Tl; DR:** Your gains are most likely characterized as "capital gains."  If bitcoins are determined to be a foreign currency, the characterization would be different.  Additionally, there are other exceptions that might apply (particularly if you are a bitcoin miner or a very active day trader).  
**Topic 4: Losses** *
** What happens if end up with an overall loss (instead of a gain) from my bitcoins?** 
First, remember that gains and losses are combined at the end of the year to reach the amount of your “net gain.”  If you had more losses than gains, however, then you will end up with a "net loss."  Given the two large market crashes bitcoin suffered in 2013, it's possible that some of you will find yourself in this position.   Net losses are deductible on your tax return, but there are some important limitations depending on whether they are characterized as "capital" or "ordinary" (character is discussed above).  
 
** Can I deduct my net losses if they are “capital?"**  
Yes, but subject to a $3,000 maximum per year.   This limitation is painfully low if you have substantial losses.  Fortunately, any losses in excess of that amount can be carried forward and deducted in subsequent tax years (still subject to the $3,000 maximum each year).  There is no limit to how long you carry your capital losses.  
 
** Can I deduct my net losses if they are "ordinary?"** 
Yes.  Ordinary losses are fully deductible and not subject to the $3,000 limitation mentioned above.  If your net losses are so big that they offset all of your other taxable income, you get to carry the unused losses back two -years (by amending your prior tax returns) as a Net Operating Loss.  Any remaining NOL can then be carried forward for an additional twenty years.  
 
Keep in mind that most bitcoin holders will not have "ordinary losses."  The only time your losses will be characterized as ordinary is if (1) you are in engaged in a trade or business with bitcoins as inventory (which is possible in the case of bitcoin miners, although it is still unresolved), or  (2) bitcoins are categorized as a foreign currency and your losses did not arise from a "personal transaction."    
*Note: this answer ignores the possibility of passive activity or at-risk limitations, which may be applicable and need to be addressed on a case-by-case basis with a tax professional.*

That would be playing it safe, but not necessarily correct.  There's a strong argument that bitcoins are a commodity - not a foreign currency - and hence should be treated as capital gains.
