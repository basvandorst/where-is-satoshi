I'm pretty sure he means the [File System API]( not local storage as LS would have no use in the streaming/encryption/decryption of files.

I think I might have figured it out!
Do ye remember the guy who posted an obfuscated version of his private key a few weeks back? In the end it turned out he randomly rearranged  the characters of the address and then converted it to binary (There might have been another step). Anyway- this address was impossible to figure out so the result was that 1/2BTC were lost forever. 
Anyway, before we realised the competition was pointless we were all making the same kind of guesses as to what the address was - Importing a shit load of the same private keys in the process. 
In comes slavik0329. He swept the 6BTC from a key-  which then got sent to one of the aforementioned addresses. Someone else realised and sent it off away to the safety of one of their other addresses. 
This might not be it. But maybe maybe...
I'm very sorry for the loss of your coins slavik0329. =[
Here's a link to the competition:

Looks like it's a 404 - is the same if you enter a clue address that doesnt exist.

Oddly they've used the css property text-transform: uppercase;  on their address which makes it impossible to send them coins unless you look at the source..
