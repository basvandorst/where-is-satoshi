If you talk to a journalist and don't assume they have an agenda, you're gonna have a bad time. If their story is not interesting, they don't get printed. If you want to see this in practice, watch Frost-Nixon. Something like 40 hours of interviews, all for a 5 minute clip.

I'm absolutely certain you don't understand the certainty of Bitcoin! It can't possibly fail! ;)

There is if they say there is. You're thinking of people who are divorcing, that's when the rule gets applied.

No, but you can write off the losses against other gains or income.

Barter is generally reportable though. If you build me a table and I fix your car, we have both received payment for services and must declare the fair market value of the thing we received as "income".

I'm in Canada, but it's true in the US also. Looks like you need to have held the asset for at least 12 months:

Whatever you sold (5 bitcoins), you need to declare the gains on that. So you have to figure out what that $700 of bitcoin initially cost you. Now, if you're always buying and selling into a pool, there's no way to prove exactly which bitcoins you sold and link them to a purchase price. I think you can choose yourself, so if you bought some at $700, you can just claim that those were the ones you sold, and claim zero gain. Or maybe you have to average the price of all previous purchases or something. I'm sure the IRS published a formula for this.
If you mined them, I'm guessing the whole value is a capital gain, but I'm not sure.
