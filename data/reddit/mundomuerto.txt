Are you suggesting that this is a non-issue because loans won't be necessary in a bitcoin economy?

I think I'm missing something. Where is the incentive to lend money at a negative interest? Wouldn't saving it be more profitable to the lender?

I'm not even sure if I would call it a trick. Bitcoin is building faith in the idea of decentralized digital currency already. As more people become open to the idea and would like to use the coin I wonder if it would not benefit them to instead start a new currency with an infrastructure established from day one (working exchanges, functional miners, etc).

Interesting. I don't know if I would consider loans necessary for an economy but they certainly grease the gears for business owners. How would you propose businesses cover expenses during early production and start-up? Down payments from large accounts might work in very small companies, still, it seems like paying interest for equipment is worth the price of outsourcing cash flow problems.
Home construction, for example, where neither the producer nor the consumer can afford the product all at once. How does a loan-free economy shoulder that burden in the interim? Smaller homes?

I don't look at this as something we would want but something they might want and we might not be able to stop. Assuming we represent less than 1% of the eventual digital currency users wouldn't there be an incentive for the late adopters to use their majority to force acceptance of a new currency?

I think this idea is getting dismissed a little too quickly due to everyone's vested interest in the current coins. I've been curious myself about the effects of an economic re-roll, so-to-speak, if the currency ever becomes too concentrated. This is a scary thought to those of us who have bought in. Right now I would guess the number of current users is a small fraction of the eventual total once it becomes mainstream. Wouldn't it make sense for a large influx of new users to just force adoption of a new coin to offset the early adopter advantage?

Earned 250btc last July using a home machine and an office machine that I left on for a few weeks. I foolishly lost interest with generating because I thought it was too slow. D'oh.
Now they're trading around a $1. You can imagine my frantic search for the old flash drive when I read that.
