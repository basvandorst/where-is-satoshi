I don't agree with keeping money on an exchange either, but I can see their reasoning. Some people want to be able to make quick moves (i.e. reacting to breaking news that may affect the market). It takes about an hour (6 confirmations) to get BTC into an exchange.

People keep on saying this, but I don't agree. It can establish itself only in the role as an alternative to Western Union. Or it can be the dominant global currency. Or it can exist purely as a decentralized ledger for other uses aside from money transfer. Or it can be nothing. There are a lot of possibilities, each giving bitcoin a different potential valuation.

That's what I mean. Would a segregation of some part of the Internet cause long-term damage to the network. If so, how large of a part and for how long?

A vanity address is fine for just receiving small amounts. Set up something to automatically transfer money to a safe wallet immediately.

People have problem withdrawing $ from Gox. So your money will be stuck in gox until you buy BTC again at their inflated price. Thus negating your original "arbitrage".

I would sell because most people won't understand this fact. Then I'll buy back in at the bottom when they realize it doesn't have much practical implication.

I agree that these number mean very little. But day trading does not count towards a payment transfer -- buying and selling on an exchange doesn't have anything to do with the blockchain.
Satoshi dice, moving BTC between wallets, and transaction 'change' however, do count towards this inflated volume.

Appropriately, I've bought magic cards with bitcoin.

It's not ASIC proof. People have just been slower to create scrypt ASICs since most of the demand have been for SHA-256 hashing.

I'm not saying it's a great idea. But if you wanted to get a vanity address like OPs with 11 specific characters in a row, no vanity address generator will find that in any reasonable amount of time.

Say if China is segregated for a week. With so many transactions in China, wouldn't this orphaned fork destroy people's confidence in bitcoin?

The idea is anything created by the computer may leave a digital trail...

Lets say Google suddenly turned on a huge ASIC farm that is 1000 Terahashes (about 25% of the entire mining network). They won't suddenly start mining BTC hand over fist. The network difficulty will adjust to this new influx of computing power to ensure that bitcoins are released at a relatively constant rate. They will get a larger share of that pie, but it won't topple BTC overnight by any means...

I think mastercoin (a protocol, not an altcoin) has a lot of potential to implement something like this.

I made a post about this the other day but didn't get much response.
What would happen if a country like china decided to block internet traffic in and out of its country for a week? As I understand, this will segregate a bunch of miners and create a large fork of the blockchain. When connection is reestablished, will the forked chain from China be orphaned and how will this affect bitcoin as a whole? I imagine it would expose a vulnerability and create a lot of panic.
Second question: does the slow confirmation time of transactions and/or the required transaction fee increase as more people use bitcoin affect bitcoins future?
Last week I sent a transaction on blockchain without including a fee and it never got confirmed. The transaction eventually got cancelled.

ASICS aren't breaking encryption. If you are referring to using brute force to break encryption (which is how you might use an ASIC to try to do so), this isn't and will never be practical regardless of computational advances.

Sometimes when pronounced in chinese, the numbers phonetically sound like other chinese words. But not in this case, 123 is just 1-2-3.

If they were to do that, they wouldn't be putting it all into one wallet.
