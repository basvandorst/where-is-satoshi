Bitcoin went from 10k to 20k in a few weeks

Yep this guy knows what he's talking about. Stock market definitely not a bubble like crypto.

The best poker players do not frequently end up bankrupt.

Guy mad that he can't afford GPUs to play video games calling people losers. Reddit is amazing.

Do you think this is the first time bitcoin has dipped?

Why so jealous?

If you want fast transactions and low fees, use PayPal. That's not what makes Bitcoin important.

It's unlimited in the sense that we can use 100% or 0% of the sun's energy and it will have no difference on how fast the sun dies.

I didn't even compare them, so sure

There actually aren't hundreds of fiat currencies that have worked. My point is that Venezuela is not an isolated case.
@_date: 2019-03-19 18:54:42
There are literally hundreds of fiat currencies that have failed.
@_date: 2019-03-19 21:12:56
Not comparable at all. I can fork a github project and start mining in 10 minutes and create a new cryptocurrency. Not so easy to spin up a government and military to back a fiat currency.
@_date: 2019-03-19 21:32:40
Of course there have been hundreds of fiat currencies.
(not every entry on that list is valid imo, some of those currencies were just replaced with other currencies, like the EURO, but still interesting)

What’s a median of exchange?

Better than buying when the market is euphoric
@_date: 2018-03-01 16:58:16
They can't. People will shill the inflation argument forever because it's what they've been taught.
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:15:02
You're wrong. I know people with thousands in their bank account, making essentially 0% in interest, who don't want to invest in things because it's unknown/scary to them.

USD is as much monopoly money as USDT
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:00:08


lol

Maybe it's not supposed to be hodled but it certainly is by many. Poor people don't buy stocks or other investments, they just put their money in the bank. It doesn't even occur to many that it's a bad idea, and that there are alternatives.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:26:55
Lmao go play video games kid. When you grow up you'll realize time is the only currency that matters, and you wasted it.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:30:03
Foolish, yes, stupid, probably. Pretty rich though. No thanks to my 401k.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:34:03
Tether worse than gox? Are you high? Tether has like $2b marketcap. Gox was 90% of bitcoin trading volume.

You're an absolute clown if you think there would be no personal computer without Microsoft.
@_date: 2018-04-17 22:29:53
In a situation like this, why is it worse to have bitcoin than anything else, other than cash in your mattress? If there's no internet/banks/etc, traditional investments will be just as useless.
