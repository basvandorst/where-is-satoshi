Quote from Rusty Russel: 
"If the block size doesn’t increase (or doesn’t increase in time): we’ll see transactions get slower, and fees become the significant factor in whether your transaction gets processed quickly.  People will change behaviour: I’m not going to spend 20c to send you 50c!"

They probably already have a lot more hashing power than 50%. 
If this problem does not get mathematically resolved, bitcoin will get replaced by a more secure coin. It is not acceptable that a mining pool has more than 50% hashing power since they obviously own bitcoin now.

That's what I have been saying. Traffic jams can be fun, sometimes you can even leave your car for a walk when being stuck in traffic. The same works for Bitcoin, when the mempool is above 5MB I am not even thinking about trying to use the network and by the time you get back (usually only a couple days later) the congestion resolved and you can use it again. I love it.
@_date: 2016-11-11 09:19:18
Nice app. It would be good if you could put a time lock on it. So that the needed combined parts could not be decrypted until a predefined certain date is reached.
@_date: 2016-11-14 11:52:46
Since a couple of years I meet occasionally a professional localbitcoins trader. And this time he asked me if it would make sense to consider adapting new (litecoin or monero) cryptocurrencies while the bitcoin network gets congested.
Generally I advised against using other cryptocurrencies because of the high fluctuation risk and rather avoid trading Bitcoin while blocks are full. The mempool can be checked at  and helps to get an idea how congested the mempool is.
But when congestion turns out to be a normal state of the Bitcoin network I will change my mind of alternative cryptocurrencies.

Cold storage should be a secure option not to lose your coins on the xt chain. 
In case you use a bitcoin core wallet.dat file and you happen to receive coins from the core blockchain after the the hard fork, I am not sure if you can use that wallet.dat file on the xt blockchain anymore since you received coins from core.
And if core loses its value, you will not be able to spend your coins on xt.
Can someone confirm this since I am not sure if it is correct?

Banks and Merchants Can Join In Minutes
The Mycelium card network is an entirely self-sufficient secure and inexpensive payment system that is based on the blockchain. The cards communicate with the blockchain through hubs in a range of about 30 meters. The hubs do not require any installation just plug them into your router and you are good to go.
Self-sufficient Payment Network
Equipping plastic payment cards of the regular size with a comparatively powerful processor, a display, a keyboard and a wireless unit opens up the avenue to use the blockchain as a backbone for the network of cards which is more functional, safe and inexpensive compared to current centralized systems such as VISA/MC/AmEx.
Blockchain Based
A digital asset such as fiat currency can be used on top of the blockchain. The advantage given by using the blockchain as the backbone for such asset manipulation is that banks, merchants and consumers can rely on the blockchain's transparency, immutability, ease of transfer and non-counterfeitability to operate with digital money with unprecedented security and ease.

Remember that btc24 got shot down out of Germany. Even though there is some bitcoin liquidity in Berlin, the german prosecutors can take vigorously drastic measures when a court order is being pursued.

Thank you for you comments. Yes, you are right I should rethink the 5% part.
Do you have any other suggestions?

php does not seem the right tool for such a task. Scala could be more appropriate. Why scala?
Scala is object-oriented: Scala is a pure object-oriented language in the sense that every value is an object. Types and behavior of objects are described by classes and traits. Class abstractions are extended by subclassing and a flexible mixin-based composition mechanism as a clean replacement for multiple inheritance.
Scala is functional: Scala is also a functional language in the sense that every function is a value. Scala provides a lightweight syntax for defining anonymous functions, it supports higher-order functions, it allows functions to be nested, and supports currying. Scala's case classes and its built-in support for pattern matching model algebraic types used in many functional programming languages.
Scala is statically typed: Scala is equipped with an expressive type system that enforces statically that abstractions are used in a safe and coherent manner.
Scala is extensible: The design of Scala acknowledges the fact that in practice, the development of domain-specific applications often requires domain-specific language extensions. Scala provides a unique combination of language mechanisms that make it easy to smoothly add new language constructs in form of libraries:
any method may be used as an infix or postfix operator, and
closures are constructed automatically depending on the expected type (target typing).
A joint use of both features facilitates the definition of new statements without extending the syntax and without using macro-like meta-programming facilities.
Scala interoperates with Java and .NET: Scala is designed to interoperate well with popular programming environments like the Java 2 Runtime Environment (JRE) and the .NET Framework (CLR). In particular, the interaction with mainstream object-oriented languages like Java and C# is as smooth as possible. Scala has the same compilation model (separate compilation, dynamic class loading) like Java and C# and allows access to thousands of high-quality libraries.
Here is a good scala developer:

Bitcoin wants to go through the roof but bad servers are holding it back. Find a way to decentralize the trading platform and it will start rising like you have not seen it yet.

I would love to come but I guess that I am too far away.
