Yes, and that is how the vast majority of people will get them.

Does your app include a widget? It wasn't mentioned on google play

This person wouldn't have know about the Internet back in the day either... It takes time to build the platform and mindshare

Thanks, I installed your app to try it out as I'm only really interested in a price widget.
For me, I only care about the BitStamp price so the cycling between different exchanges kills the usefulness of the widget for me.

Mining shouldn't matter to the vast majority of users just as the vast majority of email users don't run their own email server.

Apologies. Perhaps you should mention BIP38 on your homepage? I did a quick search  on your homepage and assumed that you weren't using it when I didn't find a mention. Good luck

In x years time you'll send him bitcoins. What's your point?

I discovered a bug in coinbase which resulted in my account being credited with 1BTC by mistake. I contacted both their support and their bug bounty emails a week ago but have only had one boilerplate response. I like their product but their support is terrible.

Yep, we need to teach people about security and the importance of protecting private keys. Products like these hold us back in that effort.
EDIT: missed the BIP38 in the title somehow. self downvoting

That's not true at all and neither is the premise of your post. Creating an account with coinbase is similar to creating a gmail account, neither requires running a server or knowing anything technical such as SMPT, firewalls, operating systems, mining etc. You should spend some time familiarising yourself with the technology.
