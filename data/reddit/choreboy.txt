Just throwing in my 2 cents. They stole from me too. They sent the closing email but then I could not withdraw and they would not respond to my support requests, then poof they were gone.

TIL there are a vast amount more idiots in this country than I'd like to believe.

Actually, I only bought. It was Doge, but it works the same.
I had a USD balance, I put in an order for X Doge @ $Y each. It was the going rate at the time, and nobody was biting. So I bumped up how much I was willing to pay per doge slightly which brought down the amount I could get. I got a partial order fill. I bumped up slightly more and got more filled. I got my total filled in about 4 orders.
As far as getting USD to VoS, I sent a cashier's check by registered mail. The total for that was $18, it would have cost $50 to wire funds ($35 on my end plus $15 they pay and charge back to you).

The $18 fee was the charge from the Post Office for sending registered mail. My bank would have charged me $35 to wire money (your bank may vary), VoS gets charged $15 to receive wired money (which they charge back to you).
For the trades I did, there's a 1% fee from VoS.

I just did my first few transactions on VoS. Everything was smooth as butter. These guys are the real deal.

*You* may not care, but what if it's a future POTUS that would have saved us all and solved our problems, but his campaign was squashed by blackmail threatening to release vids of him wankin' at his computer?
