One could say that cryptocurrencies are a dime a dozen. Once bitcoin was introduced, the model was defined and anyone can create a new one. There was once a site that could create new ones on demand.  It was funny, but it just highlighted the most important: bitcoin has the support needed to succeed and mind share of the market.  That I think is really the most important difference.
I don't really subscribe to the idea that bitcoin will go to the moon and holders will be rich. Maybe it will happen, maybe not. I just doubt it.  But, it does look like an excellent tool for paying for goods and services around the world.  The problem it has at present, though, is a very low transaction rate.  Bitcoin can't support all the transactions of Walmart in a day, let alone the world.
Still, it has that support foundation that could allow it to improve.  Other currencies totally lack that support.

I did not know about the fee, but I do know there is an "exit tax" for certain "covered expatriates" ( 2008).  So, if you happen to own a business outside the US and never knew you were a US citizen and are moderately wealthy, you can owe a lot of tax.  And, if you were an "accidental US citizen" (and that can happen if you just happened to be born in the US and never lived there), you actually owe back taxes on all of your working years, possibly.  It's nasty.

When I said "FRN", I'm referring to Federal Reserve Notes -- i.e., the US Dollar.
When I started out, I was flat broke and married. Not a great situation, but I didn't worry about it.  I just didn't take on debt.  I worked and paid rent.  I recall vividly not even having spare change for a Coke.
After getting stable employment, my colleague told me something I'll never forget.  He didn't create the expression, but I forgot who said it originally.  What he said was, "Cash in the bank is the slowest way to go broke."  He encouraged me to invest.  I also _understood_ compounded growth, but I never really "played with the numbers".
I finally sat down one day when I was 31 and decided, like you, "I'm fucked."  I had a good job, but nothing substantial in savings; one good vacation could have wiped me out.  Literally, this was 8 years I let go by and ignoring my colleague's advice.
I created a spreadsheet similar to this one:
I got it.  It clicked.  And I've been diligently putting money aside ever since.
Feel free to copy it and play around with the numbers.  The earlier you start, the more prepared you'll be for retirement.  Sadly, far too many Americans (and I suspect others around the world) assume the government will be there to support them.  It's not a great retirement when you're squeezing pennies like you have to do when you're young, especially when it even hurts to squeeze pennies.
I'm nowhere near retirement, yet, but I'm well on my way to meeting my goal of not being broke when that day comes.  And as I get older and I see my own parents, aunts, uncles, etc. entering retirement and complaining about how little Social Security is, I feel even better about the fact I didn't wait too late.
And if you get get into the habit, you'll feel far less stressed about money, since you'll have some in case there really is an emergency.

I'm not following you argument.  People invest in gold and hope it will rise. People invest in Bitcoin and hope it will rise. People invest in stocks in hopes they rise.
I didn't use the word "earn".
Even so, I would still encourage that poor person to invest at least 10% of what they earn.  Good investments will rise and, on average, most investors in the stock market see an 8% return on investment.  Compound that over 30 years, and makes for a nicer retirement.
I appreciate a person so poor they don't have a dime to their name can't invest. That said, I think most understand my point. And if you don't, try. I wish I had understood this when I was 20.

As I understand it (from 10,000 meters away)...
First there was Bitcoin.  Then Bitcoin developers and miners had disagreements about how the project should move forward.  Rather than continue to have the debates, make concessions, and reach a consensus, people just went their separate ways and Bitcoin code was forked.
Now we have Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, with supporters in each camp claiming that _they_ are users of the _real_ Bitcoin.  They had disagreement with each other before the fork and they have disagreements after the fork.  Both sides will say the other is illegitimate (or use stronger language).
Both have value, because the camps appear to be fairly sizably split.  Plus, those who had Bitcoin before the hard fork own both BTC and BCH now, and most people just do not care.  That helped immediately create value in the new coin.  If I were to go fork Bitcoin or Bitcoin Cash in the same way, it might also be successful.  After all, there will be a fairly large number of people who would say, "Cool!  I own Bitcoin-α coins now!"
IMO, the rivalry is destructive to both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash.  Each side is trying to move forward, while bashing the other side.  Not everyone is, of course.  Some just view these as more-or-less the same as Litecoin or any other coin, buying and selling in hopes to make a profit.  However, I think the rivalry is helping to potentially derail Bitcoin and crypto-currencies in general.  How can the general public trust either?  How can they be sure there will not be another fork and they just lose their money due to disagreement among developers and users?

There are many, including Amazon, Google, etc.  IMO, Amazon is over-priced now, but I might be wrong.  They definitely have room for growth; I'm just concerned that their revenue is out of line.
Anyway, these kinds of companies come along from time-to-time.  You just have to monitor them carefully.  You don't need to be an early investor.  That's not so significant for any stock you want to hold long-term.

I would not go so far as to say gold was backing anything. Gold wasn't performing too well until the mid 2000s. Not sure what all drove that price, but I do know Chinese gold purchasing was a factor.  We've seen the same with Bitcoin.  There was a while where many people I know in China had a "fever" to buy gold.  Then it was Bitcoin in more recent years.
If you take a step back and look at what drives the global economy, it's really business and real-estate.  So while you're correct that a stock is not currency and that Coke did well where some others did not, "on average" I suspect if you were careful with investing during that period of time, you could have earned the same or more money.
It is interesting to note, though, that gold tends to not lose value (even gaining value) when business slumps.  We saw that with the Great Depression and the "Great Recession", though I still think China was the bigger influence in the latter.

I don't know what the policies would be for certificates. If I owned the domain name paypsl.com, for example, and a certificate authority revoked my certificate claiming I ran a scam site, there might also be legal recourse to sue them for lost revenue, defamation, etc. Not saying it's right, but that nonsense would not surprise me.
Another general issue with certificates is that so many companies can crate them. I'm sure there is more then one unscrupulous or sloppy CA.

That's not quite the same comparison.  You want choices when it comes to internet service providers, because you want competition that might help lower your bill. These are companies out for a profit and you don't want them to control everything.
Bitcoin is different. It's not owned or controlled by anyone. Having multiple competing currencies only serves to confuse the market.
Consider email. Nearly a universal service that works with nearly every entity you interact with on the internet.
Now consider instant messaging. So many protocols exist that the service is categorically a near failure. At least within one company, it works. But, how do people in a company IM with people outside? XMPP is the only standard that gained fairly good support (and even Google was on board for a while), but the consumer-focused companies wanted it all for themselves. So, we have XMPP, SIMPLE, ICQ, AOL, Skype, Google Hangouts, iMessage, WeChat, Facebook, WhatsApp, and others. It's a mess.
So if we hope to have a globally accepted currency, we should not have so many options for doing essentially the same thing. I don't have much bitcoin (just a petty amount to tinker), but I appreciate the potential to make my life easier paying for goods around the world. But if I have to maintain 10 different currencies, I'd prefer to just use Visa or MasterCard.
Choice is good when competition helps the consumer, but choice is not good when it creates fragmentation. Just look at email vs. IM. We don't want the Internet currency to go the same way as IM.

The only problem with this argument about the 1% is that the very wealthy who control this country is by far less than 1%. I don't know what that percentage really is, but I'm thinking it's more like 0.1% or 0.01%.

Yeah, valid points.  Most significant is the question of what will drug sellers use if there is no bitcoin? The answer is the same, entirely anonymous cash they use today.
Perhaps bitcoin helped hide the identity of the sellers, I guess. But, it's not so hard for law enforcement. I assume they have dogs looking for shipments. Large numbers of shipments are easier to discover. Anyway, drugs existed before and will exist going forward. The government is just wasting too much money and energy trying to criminalize the trade.
While I'd prefer drug abuse didn't exist, I just don't think current laws are the least bit useful. Likely, it just creates a more dangerous environment.

Bitcoin might, because it's highly speculative.
For a long time, people have said Bitcoin will either go to $1M or go to $0.  They might be right.  It's been quite an interesting rollercoaster ride so far.  Sadly, it's one I can't really stomach.  I'll just have to sit on the sidelines and watch everyone go bust or get rich. :)

I agree with you entirely that people shouldn't complain because early adopters have lots of bitcoin.  That's just stupid statements of a jealous person.  Having not enough bitcoin to buy a good dinner, I still say congratulations to them if it takes off and they make a fortune.
But if it has already taken off, then I'd say prospects are not looking so good. The value keeps falling.  It's good that more merchants are on board, but I have no incentive to buy coins.  I do have incentive to use my cash-back credit card, though.
I'm really a bitcoin fan and would love to see an easier online payment option.  However, if I have to do that by spending 1% or more to get bitcoins and then watch the value deteriorate over time, that's not interesting.  If the value even held steady, I still waste 1%.
What would be awesome is if coinbase an bitpay would sell coins at no fee, charging merchants to exchange coins (as they do now).  Merchants have zero risk and I'd be more inclined to buy bitcoins for my next Microsoft purchase, for example.
Anyway, bitcoins have a long way to go to truly take off.  It's still extremely tiny right now.

I disagree. That's like saying QR codes stand against what bitcoins stand for.

Call it what it is.  It's the currency of the Internet.  "Bitcoin: The Internet Currency".
Unlike other "digital" things that work on a computer that is not connected to the Internet, Bitcoin only works there. Of course, one can make physical coins or paper wallets that have bitcoins associated with them, but one still needs the Internet to do anything with them.

Yes, really. There are a list of charges. Each one can and should be countered and objected to. The argument may not work, but it might. Chipping away at charges is like defeating the claims of a patent: you just have to point out where something does not fit exactly and you can defeat it. The reverse is true when writing software per some rigid specification.  It must be exactly right and not almost right. If it's just a little wrong, it's wrong.

It has a lot to do with it. If the RMB floated freely, we'd see prices rise.  But, you're right.  It is the massive scale of fiat currencies that bring stability -- more so than the RMB being pegged to the dollar.  The RMB pegged to the dollar does keep things more stable, though.  It's two massive currencies that are fixed in relation, thus making that scale even larger.

I dunno the "how".  But, building a P2P name resolution system is not something new.  I thought that was the whole idea behind "namecoin", though I'll confess I've not looked at it.
I have some high-level ideas.  You get a domain name purchased with bitcoins. Perhaps this purchase is recorded in a domain name ledger (references the bitcoin blockchain), separate from the Bitcoin blockchain.  You could use the private key to update the IP addresses associated with the domain name (i.e., the nameservers for the name).  That info would also go into the parallel system that records names.  Signatures can all be validated.  All things have a lifetime and expire after a year and are removed from the distributed DNS system.
As I said, I've not thought a lot about it, but I am sure it's doable.

I'm positive on bitcoin as a currency, but hitting a $10,000 mark really seems a bit of a stretch in any near timeframe. Of course, I would have said the same of $1,000.  The reason I say this is that, though Visa has a big market cap and billions are sent to families all over the world, those coins are bought and sold and recycled. Coinbase and similar companies stand to make a lot, but why would high volume buy and sell orders on an exchange lead to higher prices? Prices will only go up if people hoard coins. So long as they're not scarce, prices won't rise.  Plus, you don't want it to rise too fast. It scares the average person away.

You seem to be arguing against me and with me at the same time. Why would a person pay 7% more for bitcoins and have the hassle of shipping? And shipping overseas is an even bigger hassle with customs documentation.  Makes no sense.
I fully agree with you that there are cheaper alternatives to Coinbase. That's all the more reason people don't need to pay a 7% premium to buy bitcoins.
If it were the other way, it would make sense. If somebody will pay me 7% to buy something for them, I might consider doing it. I doubt I would due to money laundering concerns, but maybe some will.

I do believe that 5% would do it for the average consumer. The currency exchange really wouldn't be a big deal if nearly every merchant accepted bitcoin. I agree doing it for one store would be a hassle.

It wouldn't surprise me if the same existed today, but I bet it says nothing of bitcoin in any agreement.

I'm not one who is of the mind that bitcoin is going "to the moon" over the next year, but even I agree it's a useful means of exchange and, therefore, has some value greater then 0. I think the tulip nonsense is just that. A reasonable price now might be $200, but the price is whatever the market decides. Value will be related to its utility, and the more merchants getting on board, the stronger it will be, even if the price holds steady.

Price drop looked encouraging to me as one who'd like to buy bitcoin, but my wife said "no". She looked at a plot of the daily price over the past 12 months, declared it a clear bubble. In the face of the news coming out of China and the hassle with IRS rules, she didn't think it was a wise move.  She asked for median prices over the past 12 months, throwing out the month where the price went over $1K.  Turns out, the median is around $138.  She said to buy it then. :-)  She's pretty confident that the real supporting price is probably around that price.

That's not a problem. Note that these hacks presented don't actually touch the phone. Rather, they're manipulating the telephone core network.  There is no way to send a request to the phone and request arbitrary data stored on the phone through the mobile signaling interface.  You'd be much more at risk of an app grabbing that data and sending it over IP.  That's why iPhone and Android devices have the security models they do.  So long as the device is not jailbroken/rooted, an app cannot reach into the private data directory of your wallet and get a key.

Wow. You're really over-thinking this. And, not in the right way, IMO. Bitcoins will have whatever value the market decides. You can't assume anything about inflation and bitcoin value, for example.
Bitcoin might be worth $100M in days if the USD goes bust. But, that's not really what you're trying to understand.
If bitcoin becomes widely accepted globally then the price will go to the moon, as fewer people will convert it to fiat.  The increased value is highly dependent on merchants accepting it.  Otherwise, it will languish.

They control it in the sense that, if you do something illegal -- or something they believe is illegal -- they can and will take your domain away.  They control it in the sense that the US Government decides who runs the global DNS services, who allocates IP addresses, etc.  Sure, you can run services in parallel to the standard services, but then you effectively separate yourself from the "public Internet", though you're not getting away from the IP address assignment controls.

Worse, it has two flaws: it sounds like a shorthand for bitcoin, which will confuse, and the unit doesn't even come close to the meaning of bit in computer terminology. The bitcoin geeks need to step outside the nerd circle and get name suggestions from real people. The term bits is as nerdy as hell. Call it a dumb statement all you want, but it is.

Completely agree.  It's like investing in the Mastercard or Visa network infrastructure -- those companies did not "invest" in fiat currencies, per se.
All the VC funding going into Bitcoin will make it an attractive currency, but it does not mean the Bitcoin price will go through the roof. The rise in recent months has been amazing, but the "real world" market is one where you buy coins, use them at a merchant, they convert to fiat, and the cycle starts over.  BitPay, Coinbase, and others profit.  Bitcoin will be a useful monetary instrument that could displace a lot of revenue earned by credit card companies and Western Union.
But so long as coins are continually made and cycled like this, it's not necessarily the case that the value of a bitcoin will go through the roof anytime soon. Really, it would be much better if the price was more stable and rose steadily with market growth.  This growth we have seen in recent months is unsustainable.
My wife pegged the Bitcoin price at $138, looking at the median price over the past year and throwing out the month where the price shot over $1000.  She said that's a good support price.  I think she's right.

Lower prices only mean miners with high costs go out of business. The network hash rate might drop as a result. However, neither affect the price of bitcoin. Miners might demand more transaction fees, but that would only hurt bitcoin and small miners will accept the lower fees.

My understanding from the IRS (totally independent of Bitcoin, but applicable to Bitcoin) is that if you pay somebody (not a company, but a person) to perform a service (e.g., hire a person to paint your house) and the cost was over $600, you're required to provide that person a 1099.
Is my understanding wrong?

Heavens, no. If she were, I'd have made a fortune and retired already. But, he logic is reasonable. She factors in things like the median price for each month, three months, boom induced largely by China's participation, pull back due to Gox, merchants convert BTC to USD, etc. She admits she might be wrong, but I think she's considered this carefully.
@_date: 2014-12-01 14:58:53
This is a swipe fee, but I think there are still those 2.9% charges the payment professor will charge. So a debit card will cost a merchant on a $100 sale $2.90 + $0.21.  And that 2.9% might be more or less, but that seems typical.
@_date: 2014-12-30 00:35:55
I finally got a chance to look at the video.  Yeah, this is all doable with the right access to the carrier's core network.  You can imagine any government likely has its hooks into the network.  It's a bit harder for the average Joe to do this.  However, there are many, many smaller service providers around the world that create a lot of opportunities for exploit.
However, even though this exists with legacy networks and, as the presenter pointed out, many of the flaws brought over into the LTE networks, these security issues are not unique to phone networks.
You know how when you visit your bank's web site you get a lock icon and you feel secure about the interaction.  Just as your phone call can get intercepted and re-routed without you knowing it, so can your visit to your bank's web site.  You can buy a certificate from many companies selling them.  There are hundreds, if not thousands, of companies selling them.  Even Wells Fargo -- a bank! -- is a root-level certificate authority that can, if it wanted, produce perfectly valid certificates that your browser will accept when you visit a competitor.  So, just imagine that it only takes one of these companies to produce a bogus certificate.  This has happened before, BTW, so I'm not even talking hypothetically.
Now, with a certificate in hand, it needs to be possible to intercept your DNS queries.  Just like the SS7 protocols, DNS is largely insecure today.  You can ask for the address of your bank and a hacker can return the address of his/her proxy server.  With the bogus certificate installed, you get a lock icon and all your traffic looks secure, but all of it is intercepted.
On IP networks, DNSSEC exists, but relatively few domains actually implement it.  There is also a new technology called DANE that, when used with DNSSEC, would prevent an attackers from being able to carry out the exploit I just described.  Right now, no browsers support DANE.  Windows machines do not validate DNS queries using DNSSEC, either.  (I doubt most end-user operating systems do, though Linux can be configured to enforce DNSSEC.  I run my own DNS server in my house and enable DNSSEC enforcement to help thwart some of these kinds of attacks.)
Security is really a big problem with just about every protocol out there.
But back to your original question: being able to intercept or manipulate your telephone calls (going over LTE or 3G) is not going to impact bitcoin.  Bitcoin transactions could be blocked by an attacker on the IP network (either in the LTE core or outside).  However, the way that Bitcoin is designed, the only thing an attacker can do is try to block the transaction from going through.  No coins will be lost of transferred to the wrong party.
@_date: 2014-12-30 01:13:52
You're absolutely right. However, it's a huge problem for merchants, as they take the loss (at least in the US). One would think between merchant risk and high transaction fees, merchants would do something like offer 5% off for using bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-09 15:08:57
But, drug dealers existed before and will exist after. Bitcoin makes it easier to send payments, but the goods still have to be mailed and the bitcoin ledger allows law enforcement to follow the money.
No bitcoin, they just exchange cash. That's worse for law enforcement.

You just put them down as a capital loss just like the sale of stock.  They will either be short-term or long-term losses depending on whether you held for a year.

I've had one lender ask for no statements at all (possibly because my credit score and history with them), while I had one ask for several months (&gt;2) and scrutinize a single check deposit that was 1% of my account balance. I told them what it was and they then asked for proof. I told them I wasn't wasting my time over it and they gave up.
Lenders do some silly things. I appreciate trying to protect bank depositors and shareholders, but seeing a regular steam of payroll deposits, healthy balance, and only this one cash deposit should not, IMO, be an issue.
So to see a rejection based on bitcoin is not  surprising.
And this loan was for a house and did take months. You're right that they wanted more statements, but kept harping over that one transaction.
@_date: 2014-04-27 17:20:39
That was one recommended to me recently. I put about 0.05 BTC there. So far, no problem.
@_date: 2014-10-09 21:36:56
Rebound to what? Granted the sale of 30,000 coins wasn't a small matter, but look at the price for this entire year. It's a gradual decline. And, understandably. The tax crap is definitely one reason I'm not buying. I'd buy and use it if I didn't have to report a gain on the sale.
Like I said, there is a huge potential, but there's a boat anchor holding it down.
Even if it were not so constrained, though, I think the price is too high considering the global volume.  Prices for bitcoin inflated unreasonably when China started buying. If all of those buyers became big users, I'd value it higher.
For now, a reasonable price is around $150 until some event occurs that warrants a higher valuation.
@_date: 2014-03-31 04:25:49
Right. But as it relates to BTC-E, the problem is that would-be Chinese investors will have a hard time getting money to the exchange. The $50k limit is what I've heard before.

Is the site behind the domain new or old?  I see they're somehow trying to use readable names rather than the cryptic Bitcoin addresses that are bit challenging for most normal people to really understand.  [I've said it before]( but I think it would be really cool if people could just send a person money to an address like paulej for example.  Using WebFinger makes that simple and secure.
@_date: 2014-10-27 04:55:35
Yeah, they literally virtually are. There's also a reason several countries wish it weren't that way. If there was a better solution, the FRN would be dropped quickly. And if America keeps printing paper bills like there's no tomorrow, it will get replaced with a new global reserve currency. There's only so much devaluation that can occur.

It can be used as part encryption software to ensure that the encrypted file is not modified. It can also be used in secure VoIP applications to ensure RTP packets are not modified in flight. It can also be used to produce a hash of a file on disk to see if the file is changed in the future.
Basically, if you want to detect any slight change in a string of bits, hashing functions like SHA-1/256/512 will do that.

@_date: 2014-03-30 00:53:07
Don't shoot the messenger. I'm just reporting the facts.
I agree that, depending on how you use Bitcoin, it should be treated like a currency. I'd argue the same for gold if we could use gold as money these days.
If Bitcoin had a steady value versus the dollar, this likely wouldn't be an issue. But the government does not like its citizens being enriched anything, so they want their share of taxes. :)
@_date: 2014-12-24 04:19:25
That might be true if the cost of a bitcoin versus the dollar didn't rather continually fall through the floor. Whoever is buying coins are truly risk takers.
But, if bitcoin takes off, all of what you said is true.
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:03:29
I'm pretty sure it was. I have been watching bitcoin for a year. The run was driven by China, definitely. It's likely to settle at about $143 if China blocks investment in the country.
@_date: 2014-01-02 14:25:38
I absolutely agree with you that a human readable address is important. One solution is to use WebFinger. I wrote a blog entry showing both a naked address and use of the forthcoming payments API [here](
Using WebFinger, one could use his/her own email address or some address provided by a wallet service like paulej Requests are sent over TLS and it's possible for the server to charge addresses automatically. What the servers return to the client is a bitcoin URI. The user never has to see the ugly string of characters. Most people, especially those who understand tech, sorely underestimate how users get confused by something like a bitcoin address.
@_date: 2014-03-29 03:54:02
It actually came up since yesterday.  Watch out for April 15. If China puts on the brakes, we might see an exponential decline, looking like a mirror image of the November rise.

I'd love to use bitcoin for purchasing stuff online, but it's not very practical for me now, because
* Few merchants accept it
* I don't have it integrated with my browser
* The IRS tax implications are a PITA
I'd be thrilled to have a wallet right in the browser. It would be cool if the browser had a secure wallet in which I could keep funds and use for making payments. To me, that's one of the really exciting things about bitcoins. Yeah, I could use a credit or debit card, but those are not entirely painless. It's actually the frustration of entering in all those numbers that drives me to use PayPal whenever possible. If I could remove that one extra layer, I would.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:44:03
And remember that you can carry the remaining loss over to next year.
@_date: 2014-03-29 03:24:29
That's a bit around the world and back. It's a nice service for spending bitcoin at places that don't take it. To be most useful, though, bitcoin needs to be accepted directly by merchants and it needs to be painless to send money right from within the browser.  PayPal still makes this easier.  Bitcoin needs to (and could) do better.
@_date: 2014-09-30 06:44:13

I dying think you've missed anything. My wording might have made my statement read oddly.  China presents no problem for people who want to send money to China.

You want to read a publication by a bank to argue my point? All that does is reaffirm the strange notion that "money" is created out of debt, and we know governments are guilty of that same trap.  The fact is, it does not create more money. However, my ex-wife thinks like this too. She could have $10,000 in credit card debt, but thinks she's got money when she gets paid on Friday, totally ignoring the debt she has.
What I said is that it does not have to be that way. At least in the US, it's written right into the constitution that the government has the power to "coin money and regulate the value thereof" (Article I, Section 8).  And it should.  It should never borrow from a bank to have the privilege to print money.
@_date: 2014-08-28 15:42:03
I think calling it "powerful" is an overstatement. We're talking about a very narrow function of hashing data. It has not much more power than that.
My desktop computer, I'd argue, has more power, because I can actually do something useful with it.
That's not to say the mining effort isn't important, but that calling these hashing devices create the most powerful computer network doesn't seem right.
@_date: 2014-08-30 17:29:48
I did not say it wasn't useful. I took exception to calling it "powerful". It does one thing: hash. And, it only supports a single set of hashing operations. It's not powerful in the sense that we can do various tasks.
I'd say all those bots used to send out spam and launch DDoS attacks are far more powerful. They can be programmed to do many things.  But the bitcoin network does one thing only.  Useful, but not "powerful".

They don't even have to go that far. AES wasn't even created in the United States. As I said, much cryptography work happens outside the US. Also, the US allows export of open source, like OpenSSL.

@_date: 2014-12-01 21:21:54

Old people? I get crap about Bitcoin from my 19 year old son. As far as he's concerned, Bitcoin is no better than virtual currency he might buy in a video game. He works, gets paid USD, and spends USD. Back in July, I told him to put $1K in bitcoin. He thought I was stupid. When I later reminded him that he could have paid off his car with that, he was unmoved.
Bottom line is that there are both young and old who believe bitcoin has a future. What you hear in terms of negative comments are from those who just don't see the light. I'm not sure how I can even convince my son of the benefits. Showing them that you can make money goes nowhere with this group.
That said, I'm not holding BTC. It's not that I don't believe it has incredible benefit, but I don't see the right market conditions for a significant rise in value at the moment. I would not hesitate to use it to pay for goods or services, though, if it would save money or make it easier. Occasionally, I see such opportunities, but we have a long way to go.
@_date: 2014-04-11 01:39:47
Yeah, and they likely won't. Early on, they said private citizens can do with bitcoin what they want. But, they don't want the bank involved. Problem is, it makes liquidity a challenge. If it's a challenge, then the number engaged will drop. You get roughly the same result.
@_date: 2014-11-05 00:01:55
The governments regulate the currency and the value. Competition with banks? No, that's not it. Banks could accept BTC today, if they wanted.  And what government is enthusiastic about this competition with their currency?
I'd argue that it doesn't matter to most governments. They see bitcoin as a hobby or investment. It's not big enough to take the place of any government currency.  One day in the future?  Unlikely.
That's not to say bitcoin doesn't have a place in the global economy. I think it does. It's great at what it does, and I see it as an enabler of micro payments, cheap international remittance, safe online purchases, etc.  This gives it value, but I don't think it will ever be valued like gold.

If you don't like PayPal, you have options, including Dwolla, Google, and Venmo. PayPal gets annoying because of all of the fraud and AML crap they have. Others might be as bad if they were as heavily used.
EBay's biggest problem is its fees. It's highway robbery, really.  It would be good if eBay spent time growing their business rather than growing revenue through fees.
But bitcoin isn't going to change much, if anything. You might sidestep PayPal, but you could offer to pay on eBay today using bitcoin. EBay fees are inescapable.

The fact is, though, that high prices for bitcoin turn a lot of people off. And give the rapid rise to $1000, a 70% drop, etc., if we see that much volatility over the next year, I don't think it will be good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-04-16 05:05:38
But there needs to be a steady, organic growth. When bitcoin hit $1k, there were many who were turned off by the price. It was not widely used and expensive. If it hits $2500 this year, it will be doubly too expensive and not widely used. The value should be properly aligned with market acceptance. Then, the value can be justified. A slow, steady rise is far better than what we have now.

Agreed.  But consumers _always_ go for bargains.  If a person knew he or she could get 5% off every purchase at Target using bitcoins, for example, they'd be buying bitcoins each day before they go shopping.
Widespread adoption of bitcoin would benefit merchants who can cut into credit card fees and eliminate credit card fraud, counterfeit bills, etc.  Therefore, merchants really should be pushing for adoption.
That said, the bitcoin network would just fall over on itself.  It could not possibly handle all of the transactions of even one chain of stores like Target, let alone the whole world.
So many problems need to be solved before Bitcoin becomes a major force.

What I was speaking to is why VCs are putting money into bitcoin companies. They're not investing in bitcoins. Rather, they're investing in the infrastructure. They're trying to be the next Visa or MasterCard. There's a lot of money to be made in cycling coins in and out of fiat.
And of course my wife has no crystal ball. It's a speculative market that rises and falls like crazy. But it is interesting to look at the median price and discarding stastical outliers. It does not mean that's the price, but if China is shut out, I tend to think she's right.

Fiat currency could be debt-free money, but most countries choose to borrow. Given what I've learned about banks, I think it's because the banks actually control the government, not the other way around. The US government, for example, has authority to print money and regulate its value. So, no need to borrow. Seriously, none. They can't print uncontrollably, as that forces value to 0, but so does borrowing too much.
Why can't we get rid of the notion that a country must borrow money when its authorized to just create it out of thin air as it is?

There are no bits currently reserved for accounting. Pretty sure the IETF would poo on any suggestion of the sort, too. There are bits in the IP header for precedence and that might be associated with a charging function by some service providers, but that's not the intent.
Putting any kind if financial info into either the IP or TCP header is a bad idea. For one thing, there's no security there. Second, you don't want anything added to every IP packet that's not critical.  You could have an IP header extension, but that would break a lot of routers and firewalls that assume a fixed 20 byte IP header.
It's best to keep any financial transactions in the application signaling layer where they can be secured.

Bitcoin hasn't even gone mainstream yet.  By comparison to all other financial transactions, Bitcoin accounts for a very, very, very small part. If most people started using it daily, the blockchain would explode in size and, even if I can afford the hard drives to store it, why would I want to?  As discussed  if Bitcoin handled as many transactions as Visa, you'd need 32TB of disk space to hold one year of transaction data.  Got that sitting around?  That's just one year.
My question is entirely valid.  Somehow, the blockchain has to be managed and very few companies would be able to manage it.
My guess is that big, major companies would eventually control Bitcoin entirely.

Those are small banks. They're not the "too big to fail" banks. Also, the fact they went out of business does not mean they are really in much worse shape than the acquiring bank.  The acquiring bank would assume all of the debt of the bank (usually depositors / creditors), but also assume ownership of all outstanding loans.  Those loans == cash.  The FDIC might step in and provide some funding to cover the difference between the loan amounts and the cash on hand.
The fact is there is NOT enough cash in the bank to cover all of the depositors' funds. If everyone went down to his or her local bank to withdraw, the bank would be broke.  And if enough people did this at enough banks, the FDIC would go broke.  Their insurance system only requires a very small amount of funding.
But, don't worry... all will be saved by the infinite power of the printing press.  The government will just print more dollars.  You'll take those and then put them back into what you consider a "safe" bank... and then they'll pull the funds back out of circulation again.

If the IRS demands it, they might be required to provide a brokerage report with your SSN to the IRS.  Remember the IRS treats bitcoins like stocks or gold.
They might also need to know your credit history, so they don't get scammed.
They definitely don't want to get scammed, so they want to know how to find you.

If I were to do the same analysis this year, I suspect it would still be about $150. Nothing has really changed to support a higher price. There is wider usage now, but there are also more coins in the world.
There is a support base for bitcoin, but as demonstrated today, it's not $300 or higher.

It would be most useful if there is bidirectional communication. If you just want to control the start and stop of a DDoS attack, reading from the block chain works.

It's definitely possible. There's continual growing interest.  But, how long-lived that interest will be remains to be seen.
What we need is a better measuring stick. Measuring against the dollar is really not good, unless you preface it with some assumption that the dollar will maintain current purchasing power or something.
A few decades ago, a new car or new house was much cheaper. If you had $100K on hand, that could go a very long way. Today, far less.  So keeping dollars is a waste.

Actually, the current decline in bitcoin price is a bit different than history. Historically, there were sharp increases and crashes that then led to higher prices. On average, prices rose steadily.

Agreed. Something interesting to consider, though, is that many goods are purchased with prices in RMB or RMB presented in USD.  Seriously, tons of money flow from the US to China.  Chinese sellers can put USD prices on invoices, because of the fixed relationship between the USD and RMB.

There are never facts to support any price on a speculative investment. It's an estimate based on some mathematical modeling.  My wife pegged it at $138 about six or eight months ago, I forget how long.  This was based on the historical, normal, organic growth of bitcoin.  What we saw late last year was an unnatural growth that peaked at about $1200.  It was entirely out of proportion with reality.  I'm "asstimating" it might be valued now at $150, though my guess is as good as the next person's. However, the $138 was not a number arrived at by simply pulling a number out of the air.

"Not renewing control of DNS" really does give a false impression. Not trying to be argumentative, but if I didn't know what was going on, it would sound that way.
There are governments around the world that want the UN, likely via its ITU arm, to manage IANA functions and DNS. However, there are those who do not want government control at all. Rather, they want an international, independent organization to manage it.  The Internet Society is a good candidate, though they are a US nonprofit, I think. That might cause heartburn for some.  But, they're definitely a reasonable choice.
In the end, I can definitely say that DNS isn't going away.  But, I fully support any effort for a decentralized DNS like namecoin. The US government is unlikely to stop seizing domain names like gambling sites and Megaupload. While I don't want to encourage violation of laws, the US has a real problem with enforcing laws and presumption of innocence. In the case of Megaupload, basically the company was forced out of business without having a single day in court to argue innocence.  I can't say whether they were guilty of piracy or not, but Napster, YouTube, and other American companies were either ignored (YouTube) or had their day in court (Napster).

If I had a retail business, I'd still accept credit cards, but would give a 5% discount to bitcoin users. If all businesses did that, I suspect credit card use would drop.  Many use credit cards because they actually have no money.  Thus, they're not going away.  However, many use them only because it's not practical to carry around a bunch of money all the time.

This article is insane.  "If Bitcoin ever became a real currency, it would suffer from the crippling problems of the gold standard."  I think it was crippling, because we didn't have enough to pay debts owed.  That, and the fact that it's manipulated in the market. Bitcoin could be manipulated, but left alone, either would not be an issue.
This article is all about how deflationary money is bad, arguing that it puts off spending. I don't agree.  You either need something or you don't.  But, I can understand how people might say this.  The US, especially, is one where out-of-control spending is essential for proper functioning of society.  Thus, the average American is broke all the time.
Perhaps more importantly, ignoring the fact that Bitcoin prices have been up and down in wild swings, over the long-term, I would not expect the deflationary nature of bitcoin to be huge.  Over a 100 year period, sure: the value of your money grows.  Over a year? You'd not notice it once the currency starts to stabilize.

So, is there a coordinated effort to provide feedback? Clearly, some world prefer Bitcoin be treated as a currency, but treating it as property has benefits for anyone who might want to make speculative investments.
For certain, if I bought bitcoin so I could turn around in a day or two to buy something online, the tax paperwork simply isn't worth anyone's time. Yet, I guess it's nonetheless required. There are definitely changes needed to allow bitcoin to be useful as a currency.
@_date: 2014-12-29 07:08:56
This is key. If you spend bitcoin and don't buy more, you're basically contributing to a price decline.
Knowing that, I'm doing nothing to address that. Who the heck wants to fill out pages and pages of tax documents in the US to report gains/losses relating to every single transaction? I don't, so I just don't use bitcoin.
We need to get bitcoin reclassified as a foreign currency.  I'd buy and use it then.

It is hard to peg a fair price, but $175 is likely a more accurate number right now.  And I don't say that to be negative on bitcoin.  The reality is it's still scarcely used.  Most nontechnical people have trouble using it.

A couple of months ago, people were saying that bitcoin has a support base at $500. That's been proven wrong. It's really hard to speculative about what the bottom will be, but I remember feeling very comfortable the $150 price. A new study might be needed, though, as much has changed over the past several months. We have both wider adoption and more coins that dilute the value.  Still think $150 is closer to the right price.

Visa is far bigger than 100x. Just in the United States alone, there were a total of 73 billion credit and debit card transactions in 2012 (source: 
I think the max number of transactions per second bitcoin can handle is about 6, while big payment networks and handling about 2300 per second.  And just think of the storage costs.
Total number of bitcoin transactions is 57 million consuming 30GB of space. If my math is right, you'd need 38TB of disk space to hold the same number of transactions as occur in the credit and debit card network in the US alone.
If bitcoin could get only 5% of the US transactions, it would be about 2TB of disk space annually.
In short it doesn't scale to meet the needs of a real payment system. Who in their right mind would pay for that much storage space? And how would you store it?  The core software would have to be rewritten to partition the data in some scalable way.  Maybe professional bitcoin mining companies?  In the end, you're back to having something like Visa and MasterCard control the network.
Bitcoin can be successful, but shouldn't attempt to take over significantly as a real payment method due to scaling issues.

OK, I see you point now.  If we see a single or just two miners getting all the coins, I'd believe this could happen.  But I assume serious miners are staying competitive with all costs. Also, if a miner or two drove the price down like that, everyone would lose confidence.

Calling it a "bet" is right. And, they're likely to fail. Not only are the odds against them, we've never successfully mined anything in space.

Energy is not what backs it.  If there was one miner or 1,000,000 miners, the same number of bitcoins would be produced.
But, I appreciate the fact that there is (or likely will be) an relatively stable proportion of miners to the present value of bitcoin or bitcoin transactions.  The more reward, the more people want to mine.  The less its worth, the fewer will want to mine.
However, I do not think we should attribute the value of bitcoin to mining.  This is a function of the network, but not in itself what gives value.

I could write a bunch of text (and did, but deleted it since not everyone on this forum cares about this side discussion), but the bottom line is that if you carefully manage your home purchases and work interest rates and tax deductions to your favor, you can own your home after some number of years and save money.
You can do that or you can pay somebody else your entire life so you can have a place to live.

I like to use my mother as a good example of "what would it take to get her to use bitcoins?" The first hurdle is that there is no advantage to her. She doesn't send money internationally. She shops with cash and credit cards.
Give her a 5% discount and she might jump on board.  Merchants should do that, as bitcoin offers benefits to them. No charge backs, no risk.
The other hurdle is taxation.  Who wants to track every transaction?  IRS needs to classify bitcoin like a foreign currency.  If you buy it to use in small quantities, no tax implications. If you hodl like gold, then there would be. They do this with foreign currency.

Tax treatment is truly a problem for bitcoin. The IRS treats it like a stock. That doesn't make a lot of sense, though it works fine for those who are truly investing in it.  For those using it as money, it's painful. And I'm sure that was their intent.  I get the impression that those with power still pull strings to keep it that way.
This must change, though. We have one agency declaring it money, the courts have called it money, and only the IRS calls it something else.  The IRS stands alone among federal agencies.  They're responsible for holding back the technology.

That drop can be ignored, as it was early on in a time of great uncertainty. Also ignore the crazy $1100 run, as that was artificial in that it was hype.  Take the time from about Jan 2013, throw out anything over $600, and try to estimate the price. I'd venture to guess that prediction models would show a price of $175 to $200.  There is an established base for bitcoin and you can visually see it in the graphs.  The fall all of this past year was totally unexpected by me, but I do expect it to settle at a point on that curve you'll plot.  Heck, maybe trow out all of 2014 just to make plotting simpler. I'll bet you'll arrive at an fairly accurate base value in the range I mention. Might be slightly higher, but it's not $400 or more.

Yeah, it will fall. That then means there are fewer miners, so easier to mine and those remaining miners make a profit. If Bitcoin rises, more miners will jump in and the difficulty will rise.
I think this was entirely expected, which is why the difficulty adjusts so that the number of coins mined remains relatively constant.

I still fail to see where this says the United States cannot default. Sure, the debt is valid debt.  But there is a point at which debt cannot be repaid if it gets too high.
I believe the US Currency was the reserve currency, simply because, at the time, we had one of the better GDP to debt ratios and because the US economy was so huge.  It still is huge, but China is poised to take the lead position with its massive economy. They're already calling for a new world reserve currency.
If that happens, we could no longer print our way out of debt (wrong, I know, but it looks like it). If our economy deteriorates, default may happen.
I see nothing so far that makes that an impossibility. Clauses in a Constitution can't prevent it.

One can attempt to interpret it that way. However, you are no doubt aware of the expression "you can't squeeze blood out of a turnip."  If the debt continues to grow and is not controlled, there *will* be a point at which the United States cannot pay the debt.
Personally, I do not agree that this says the US cannot default.  At the time this was written, the notion of default was unquestionable; it wouldn't be necessary.  However, as the US debt grows with respect to the GDP, we increase the risk of default.  We're not there, yet, but how many years at the current rate of debt growth might it be?
So, we have a piece of paper that says the debt shall not be questioned.  Nobody questions it.  It's acknowledged as being real.  However, the ability to pay that debt is surely questioned.  It's arrogance to think we can borrow without control and not default.
Or are you saying that when we reach that point of no return, we just hand the country over to debt collectors?  At that point, they would not want the run-down dump the US would be by then.
I think a more appropriate interpretation is simply that the US will take responsibility for its debt, but you cannot jump to that final conclusion that default is impossible.  Nobody would want to default, but a growing debt without bound will lead to total economic destruction.

Likely the reason why is that if these companies make a sale in Germany, for example, and process the payment on BitPay, there is a tax liability in both Germany and the US. If they keep that money outside the US, at least there are no US taxes. So, you can blame it on tax code.

Is selling bitcoins through LBC a violation of Coinbase's TOS? I looked, and the only thing I saw related to that was the MSB section that says "you confirm that you will not use Coinbase Services to accept payments..."  Selling bitcoins to somebody at your local McDonald's is not using Coinbase to *accept* payments.
Anyway, this is all a load of manure (referring to all of the money laundering and KNC requirements). All these laws exist, but they don't stop the huge, powerful drug cartels.

If the stock market crashes, then we're all eating dirt. Seriously. The stock market is indicative of the health of the economy and everything is relative to it, including jobs. If we see a crash and the crash isn't corrected, then the unemployment lines grow to a point where we cannot support everyone.  Crime rises. People starve.  Welfare goes broke, so forget that.
Bottom line: chill. It will recover.  It is also a good time to make money, because it will recover.  It wouldn't surprise me, though, that if there is a crash, it's brought on by those in control to further inflate their wealth while the rest are saying, "I'm glad I got out before I lost everything."
In our modern society, owning companies is the way to financial security.  I wouldn't run for "cash".  We already know that's not safe.  Bitcoin?  Who knows, but diversity of assets is generally good.  The problem is that the system can be controlled by the world's banks with the support of the State.  So, not sure that's any safer than anything else.

This post seems to flawed in many ways.
China might have cheap electricity, but that's about all you say that might be correct. That said, you can produce your own electricity if you created a large enough mining business.  The heat from miners could drive engines, solar panels could provide needed power, and if you have a really big operation, perhaps use wind power.
China has a lot of mountains? They also have a lot of desert.  The US has both features, too.
And what does it matter that it's a communist country.  The US can take over any business it wants or shut it down. And they have.  Business with most companies in China is about like any in the US. And the US has state owned businesses, like the postal service and Freddie Mac. My city provides my electric service.  There are many such examples.
China's internet is good internally. Connectivity to the rest of the world is also excellent, but most traffic is subject to deep packet inspection.  That slows down most things.  However, there are ways to get direct, clean connections around the Great Firewall of China.  Many companies do.  Plus they only need a few to help convey blocks found.
Manufacturing in China is cheaper, so go manufacture there. Or Mexico. Or...
Don't be so worried about China. If bitcoin ever becomes truly huge, you'll need to worry about every government trying to control it. And that will lead to stable currency or failure.

With a hard fork, I assume there would be two separate blockchains.  Given that, you should effectively have two sets of coins.  But, I don't want to steer you in the wrong direction.  I've only passively monitored Bitcoin for a while.  I sold nearly all of my coins a few years ago, because I really could not deal with the crazy ups and downs anymore.  I'm still keenly interested to see something like Bitcoin be a success, but I would personally prefer to use it to pay for stuff, rather than just hold it and hope it goes to the moon.  But the fact I don't have any bitcoins of significance likely means it will go to the moon.  Now if I bought a bunch tomorrow, it would surely tank.  That has largely been how things go with me and investing in general. :)  I'll do the community a favor and stay out of it.

I never subscribe to such doom &amp; gloom. In the event that we have a total collapse, we're all going to be eating dirt. There will be rioting, looting, and anarchy, especially from those predisposed to criminal tendencies. The rest will be defending themselves.
Given that, governments aren't going to allow a total collapse.
You have to keep in mind that the entire economy is smoke and mirrors, anyway.  What is real, though, are demands for goods and services. That is the fundamental driver in society.  That will drive any economic recovery.
If we have a serious collapse, I'd strongly suggest we get rid of the fed and central banking system. Those are the reasons why there is any turmoil in the first place. Replace them with the government actually controlling the money, move away from ever having government debt, and let trade work naturally.
But I'm sure nobody wants to be eating dirt, so there will be a solution in place.
Bitcoin won't help if there was a total collapse, as we wouldn't have the infrastructure to support it. Gold would work.

So, I'm wrong.  Still, that 6% dividend is paid out to the private shareholders.  So, it's not the government managing the money.
And from that Wikipedia article:


In short, it's not the government managing the money.  The government has some input, but the bank is absolutely controlled by its shareholders at the end of the day.  It's all smoke and mirrors.  We don't need this kind of arrangement to have a functioning treasury.
Before 1913 when this scheme was put into place, we had no federal income taxes.  The federal government didn't need to charge federal taxes, because it could manage debt by collecting duties and printing money.  With the introduction of the federal reserve system, the nation became debt-based.  The government borrowed the money it needed and we then starting having a national debt that had to be paid back by taxes levied on people.  That is was brought about the federal income tax.
Yeah, this is a totally corrupt system.  There is absolutely NO reason the US government should be borrowing money from anyone and paying interest.

Yes it is. Look at the national debt before the federal reserve vs. after.  Except for the civil war, it actually was pretty good for a while, even going to $0 in one year.  Looking at the inflation rate is not nearly the same as looking at our debt per capita or debt per GDP numbers.




How can you say this is unstable?  The system today is borrowing from the banks and paying interest, with money coming in through taxes.  Before the federal reserve system, we used gold to back the money we printed, which was sorta true until we went off the gold standard. At that point, we actually didn't have the gold to back the money, so it was a big lie, really.  Now, money is backed through a guarantee to strip you of your last dime, as necessary, to pay people the government borrows money from.
If our government was in complete control of the money, then we would not be beholden to creditors.  I don't see how that is in any way unstable.




Yes, precisely.  They funded the federal government for years.  You can still have free trade.  You're confusing the concept of free trade with taxes.  If you think tariffs are a bad idea, then we should perhaps repeal all state sales taxes, too.  Most countries in the world have tariffs on goods.  The US has insanely low tariffs, but the duties collected on those could be a huge boost to the federal budget.




That doesn't provide evidence that it's a good thing.  Just look at the debt per person in the tables I posted before.  It's just gone up like crazy since the federal reserve was introduced.

I went to a US Mint once to watch them print pallet loads of $100 bills. They made it a point to say that the money is sent to their customer (just one!): the Federal Reserve Banks.  Yet, those banks are not owned by the government.  They're owned by shareholders and we don't even know who they are.  Does not not smell like a scam?
During the most recent recession, the government felt it necessary to increase money supply. If it were in control of the money, it could just print it and put people to work, then later recover they excess printed money through taxation.  But that's not how it works: it borrowed that money and now we have to pay interest on that money.  The fact the government has to borrow money tells you it's a scam.
Just think how much easier it would be on all of us if we did not have to pay the wealthy shareholders of the federal reserve interest on money the government has to borrow in order to operate.

How coins get assigned to an address is history I don't need for 50 years. What's important to users of bitcoin is what address has money right now.  As part of the mining step, miners could propose  deleting old blocks and certain old transactions, while inserting a claim that +address X has 395 bitcoins.". That now bcomes part of the blockchain.  It really doesn't matter how X got those 395 bitcoins, but when the block is sent out, the assertion will be verified.  Once verified, the history is purged.
Anyone could keep every transaction forever, if they want, but there's no reason for most nodes to grow their blockchain database indefinitely.

Nah, we just borrow money and pay interest, plus dividends on federal reserve profits, because ... what?
Let's look at this another way: why is there any reason to have private banks or individuals as shareholders? We did not need it before 1913 when the grand FED scheme was crafted.
Why doesn't the treasury print money and put that into the treasury?  Why does the country feel compelled to borrow money from banks or individuals?
You see, these rich bankers got together and ... well, here we are.  This is definitely a scheme to profit some very wealthy folks and they like to keep it just as it is, meanwhile the debt is growing so large we can barely manage to pay the interest due.  At some point, we will fail to do that.  And at that point, the government will create things like "negative interest rates" to pay the real owners of this country.  They'll decide to raid the 401ks.  They will demand you hand over your gold (which they actually did once already).

Of course, but so does borrowing.  Either way, we're inflating the money.  Note before that I said we should remove the excess through taxes.  The federal government has done that since the beginning, but they just used taxes on imports.  They managed the money very well until the federal reserve came along.


If it had not happened already, sure.  Given that these are the realities that happen when the government gets into bad shape, it's not fear mongering.  In fact, the FDIC, Federal Reserve, and the Bank of England have _already_ discussed plans to do essentially steal your money once the economy goes to hell (  Reading through that and other documents, including your depositor agreement with a bank, will show that you're merely an unsecured creditor to the bank.  Though the FDIC offers insurance, the amount can be changed.  Negative interest rates have been used in other countries.  And the US did steal everyone's gold once.  (Well, they gave everyone market value for it with "federal reserve notes".  Then the gold price immediately shot up from $20 to $35, if memory serves, since the gold was out of Americans' hands.)
I'm still looking for a compelling argument for why we need the federal reserve.  One cannot be made, except by those in control of the money.  The big bankers in 1913 made their case, likely with bribes.  They got what they asked for.  Now we're a nation of debtors.
As I said, the treasury managed the money and debt just fine before the federal reserve.  Thus, there is no valid argument for having that system which is absolutely controlled by the people in power.  It's a racket.

Pruning and discarding is reasonable. One doesn't need a record. What one needs is a current view.  Certainly, somebody can record everything is they wish, but it has little value. Is somebody going to dispute an old transaction? No. There's nobody to take it up with, anyway.
Keeping a certain history, like 6 months, plus a record showing all addresses with coins is all that's needed.

While supportive of bitcoin, I can't dismiss the possibility that bitcoin might get replaced by something else. Before the web, people used FTP much more than they do now. UUCP was big. USENET was extremely popular. People used gopher and other tools to share information on the internet.
HTTP has largely displaced the use of many other protocols. Some protocols have disappeared with time, because there were better tools.
So don't laugh away the possibility that bitcoin might get replaced with something better.  If it's really a lot better, people will jump on board.  They won't jump on board if it's only marginally better, though.  HTTP has its warts, but there would be negligible benefit to trying to recreate that.
@_date: 2015-03-10 08:06:24
That's a good question, but the biggest elephant in the room, IMO, is the theoretical 51% attack, which I assert isn't so theoretical if some well-funded entity took interest (e.g., world banks or governments).  Just imagine if the world banks got on board and decided all transaction fees would be 3%.  If they controlled most of the hashing power, they could set the rules.
The other issue is the ever-growing block chain.  I have raised that point and been shot down over it, but I do have my limits and the current data set is nearly reaching that limit.  The network needs to be self-pruning.  Anyone with an interest could keep all the history, but I don't need it.
The other major problem is the supportable transaction rate.  At present, the bitcoin network can hardly match the transaction rate of a single Walmart.  It definitely can't support the transaction volume of all Walmart stores. By no stretch of the imagination can it support even a healthy fraction of the global transactions per second.  It needs better scalability.
It might be possible to tweak bitcoin to address every point. Or, another solution might come along and solve everything.
What other big items need to be addressed?  Whatever protocol can solve them could displace bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-11 01:09:30
Why would masses mine when they have so little hope of earning coins?  At the current network hash rate, I could never hope to earn even one coin with a small miner.  So I wouldn't buy one. Once big players have so much invested in mining, small miners would just disappear.  And they won't get blocked easily.  It's a distributed system and they can relay results through any one of hundreds or thousands of cloud service providers.
Storing coin information differently would truly be wonderful. The block chain is big and too big IMO.  Who wants to waste all the bandwidth and storage cost?  I've got 15TB of storage space, but I don't think the current size is reasonable.  It's a waste of money.  I ask myself why I even keep running a node.  After the machine bites the dust, I likely won't.
The incentives just aren't there for most people, which lends itself to big corporate control.
And you raise a good point that an alternative could be introduced that does give incentive.  Imagine Walmart creating the "Walton".  Whatever you buy with the waltons give you a 5% discount at Walmart or Sam's. Every redneck in America will take sudden interest.  Maybe its a coin issued by the national banks in America.  Storing that coin in the bank might be free, whereas they might charge $25/mo to store USD.  I guarantee nearly every American household will jump ship to the bank coin to avoid that $25 monthly fiat currency storage fee, especially if conversion is made free.
Bitcoin represents freedom from the establishment, but honestly most people don't care about that.  That makes bitcoin a hard sell and, if the concept grows, will prompt action from the establishment.

Is this Australian law you're talking about?  In the US, it doesn't really matter if it's a currency or an asset (it's classified both ways by different departments -- whatever gives their department some control!), taxes are always due on any profit made.  The IRS demands taxes to be paid on your illegal drug or child porn operation: they don't care at all about the fact it's illegal, only wanting their share.  That's just how unethical the tax folks are.  In the US, the only question was "what is the tax rate" and the IRS settled that by classifying it as an asset.
But at the time Bitcoin was created, it was just a concept with a very slim chance of it really making it big.  It did make it big (in relative terms, of course), so the real Satoshi might be sitting on a huge amount of "potential" value.  Unless transacted, then even under Australian law, where is the tax avoidance?

The problem is that borrowing and fractional reserves go hand in hand. That's true even without the federal reserve.
If I deposit $1000 with the bank, then somebody borrows $500 and the person receiving the $500 deposits it in the bank, the bank will claim to have $2000 in assets. That's a flawed system that has operated long before the fed.
Even if the bank didn't count the loan as an asset, they'd still claim to have $1500, which it doesn't actually have.  But, at least that would be closer to the truth.
So maybe the problem isn't borrowing, but the flawed approach accountants follow.  Even the IRS forces that kind of broken logic on businesses.  For example, if your business earns $100K in revenue and you use $75K to buy equipment to run your business, only a fraction of that $75K can be deducted as depreciation.  The balance is an asset and taxes due on that revenue.  If you paid employees, rent, utilities, etc. $25K, you'd have to borrow to pay taxes.  In short, the IRS wants its money even if that means reducing the purchasing power of a business.  Of course, the super-wealthy are OK with that, because they have the money to buy whatever: land, buildings, etc.  SMBs, though, are controlled.
So, they borrow in early years and pay more taxes.  And so it goes until they have money to escape that initial choke hold on their finances.
Anyway, where I'm going with that is that I agree the system is corrupt and tailored to benefit those with lots of money.
Borrowing is virtually forced on every citizen these days.  And, except in instances where we can peg the loan against an fixed asset that's not likely to drop in value, I still think loans are a bad idea. I appreciate the benefit to the borrower, but it's not good for those of us who are not in control of our own money and forced to live with the consequences of bad loans.

Yeah, that's certainly a problem.  The low cost loans right now are so crazy, I was actually paid to borrow money the last time I bought a car.  I'm not joking.  I was going to borrow from my credit union, but the car dealer offered a lower rate and the first month payment.  The first month payment was more than the total of 48 months of very low interest.  Thus, I was effectively paid to take the loan.
Tell me that is not messed up.

Not being a financial wizard, I can't help but think as I read that that the root of all financial problems is borrowing money.
I appreciate that some borrowing is necessary, such as buying a house, when everything purchased is with borrowed money, there's a growing problem waiting to explode.
At least with a house, there is a real value that another will accept in exchange for currency.  So effectively, a house is like money.  Financing weapons, retirement, roads, etc. is like destroying money.
Interesting question are who is profiting from this excessive borrowing and why doesn't it just stop?

It is still bad, even without the government.  The problem is how the banks represent their assets.  Fed or no fed, government or not, if I have $100 and loan it out, I shouldn't say I still have $100 and loan it again.  Banks do that all the time.  You wouldn't do that yourself, likely, because if you loaned out the $100, it's really not in your hand now.  But banks get that same money back from the next depositor.
So, you're right that loans themselves are not bad, but the way banks do accounting with respect to those loans is horrible.
@_date: 2015-03-08 04:23:05
Completely agree.  I've heard a lot of reasons for not getting into the bitcoin game and the fact that someone might be wealthy already or get wealthy is nowhere on that list.
The average person I talk to doesn't consider bitcoin as a safe investment. Considering its short history, I cannot blame them.
Further, most people don't even invest.  So, most are not buying bitcoins for investment purposes, anyway.  Why would the average person buy bitcoins?  There presently is no compelling reason to, and so they don't.  That would change if they could go to Amazon and get a 5% or 10% discount.  Until something like that happens, most people will remain uninterested.
Most people who do invest are investing in businesses.  Why?  Because regardless of what currency is popular today, you will still need to buy food, gasoline, etc., and you'll use currency to do it.  Companies that provide essential services are great investments that can weather economic downturns -- most of the time.  And, importantly, if the economy is so bad that we're all eating dirt, nobody will have computers to tinker with bitcoins.
There are also looming questions of who will control bitcoin.  Appreciating that it's fully distributed, any government or perhaps the G20 countries could set up a data center or series of data centers and entirely control it.  And what if lawmakers passed a law next week making it really difficult to even buy or accept bitcoins (of course with all good intentions of preventing money laundering while still allowing the anonymous paper dollar)?  Governments can clobber bitcoin with laws if they wanted.
I've not personally bought or spent any bitcoins in 2014, because I don't want to deal with the IRS tax headaches.  With every single transaction reportable like a stock sale, it's simply not worth my time.  I filled all that out on my 2013 taxes and I don't want to do it again.  There may be a few more like me who don't want to deal with the IRS implications.  And I won't personally buy bitcoin hoping to make a fortune.  I would buy it and use it if there were services I could only pay for via bitcoin, but that doesn't exist.
I do appreciate that not everyone has a credit card and so bitcoin could fill a need for many people who want to buy goods and services online, but there are still few places that accept it.
@_date: 2015-02-16 16:46:58
Yes, I understand, but it's not just due diligence.  Let's say I owned the theater building the supposed new owner acquired.  He borrowed $2M from the bank and paid me. The banks treat that loan as an asset.  Then I deposit the $2M in the bank.  Then the bank claims $4M in assets.
This one is slightly more justified since this is property.  It can be sold to repay the loan.  But, if there are lots of loans with weak support, that's the problem.
Housing loans themselves were not the problem.  The recession happened, people lost jobs, there were too many houses on the market, prices went down, banks were under water.  Banks ought not loan without that traditional 20% down.  That would have helped.
But, I think bank accounting needs fixing, too.

What's this fear and greed nonsense? Banks will adopt it if it helps them more efficiently send money around the world or track assets. As it is, the banks use dinosaur processes and they know it.  They really need a good ledger like the blockchain, even if for internal use.
But they don't fear bitcoin.  Bitcoin doesn't scale.  The network chokes on just a few transactions per second.  One or two Walmart stores would strain the bitcoin network.
Bitcoin might be a good place to store your money, like gold or stocks.  It's speculative, but so are all investments.  However, I'm even more skeptical about that these days given the growing size of the blockchain, consuming lots of storage and bandwidth.  Nodes are dropping off.  Who will be left controlling the network?
I know pruning was recently introduced in the core client, but pruning needs to happen as a matter of practice.  There's no sense carrying forward old transaction details for historical purposes in the bitcoin network.

Bit banks are short money, because of how they count assets.  Those assets in the form of loans are assets, but they're also a liability (in the sense that they are a risk).
So the housing market crashed, as you explained, and banks were short of cash.  The real problem was that so many home loans were issued on about 100% of the value.  Oddly, too, most banks just hand the loan over to Fannie Mae/ Freddie Mac.  They just service the loans.  So I'm wondering how much of the problem was left in the banks hands.  I can tell you for sure that my last home loan, which was for about 50% of the home value, was almost immediately sold to Fannie Mae.
I completely forgot what stated the initial fear and selling, but if loans were only on 80% or less of the reasonable value, we wouldn't have such a problem.
That said, my own county tax assessor is as guilty as them all, appraising my home about 25% higher than it's actually worth.  I argued against the appraisal, too, but they kept it high so they could earn more tax dollars.
I have yet to understand why we tolerate property taxes. Lose your job and the government will put you on the street for failure to pay property taxes.  Totally illogical.  Taxes should come only from income producing activities.  I wouldn't mind a local income tax paid regardless of where you work, but I hate property taxes with a passion.

This is true, but China is catching up fast.  Perhaps more importantly, China dwarfs the United States in terms of BTC exchanges.  Heck, AFAIK, the US doesn't even have a sizable exchange.  There is CampBX, but people are having trouble there with verification and depositing funds. So, their volume is low.  America has to look to Europe and Asia for Bitcoin.
There is Coinbase, of course, which almost negates the need for anyone buying bitcoins to go to an exchange.  Still, I still believe what the Senate says will have no negative impact on bitcoin, given they have so little representation in the United States. But, if the Senate says anything positive, it will give the currency a boost.
Likely, they will not say anything positive. Why would they want to encourage competition? Why upset the big banks and people behind them that own this country?

One does not actually send money via email.  Rather, one is using an email-style address.  Say I want to send money to you.  I know your email address (or your wallet address) as loki  I tell my client to send 20 BTC to that address.  It performs a WebFinger query to your WebFinger account (which is over TLS).  It gets either the actually bitcoin address or a bitcoin payments URI.  From either, it then knows how to send money to you.

Are you concerned about securing the server or securing the employee's computer? Coinbase could have 1,000 servers in the central office or in the cloud and be secured in the same way no matter if the employee is local or remote.  It's not the servers that are the concern, but the fact data can be copied from those servers to the employee's local computer.  But, one can copy data locally or remotely.  The best any company can do is give employees a "dumb terminal" (e.g., a chromebook) and try real hard to prevent copying data from said terminal.  However, data can still be copied with effort.
You can't really ask for more than limiting employee's access to information.  For example, the system should not share a complete SSN.  Even my local bank branch officer cannot see my SSN on her system.  She said all she can do is allow me to enter it and the system will validate it.  Basically, my data is shared only on a need to know basis.  And, I would guess Coinbase would do the same.

There are certain laws that are absolutely ones that should be known, like "you cannot murder people."  But, "you can't take somebody's money and move it to another account in their name" is hardly the same kind of offense.  I can appreciate a fine, but not this.

It sounds like your teacher is clueless and does not have the mental capacity to educate herself on Bitcoin to see what you're writing about.  Washing a car or doing other chores in the house is hardly the "age level" of a bright person in the 8th grade.  My son was into robotics in 7th grade!

I'll give you a vote, because I fully agree with you.  Thus the reason for asking the question in this post.  Bitcoin is very interesting and has potential, but its full potential is encumbered by complexity that the average user neither wants to bother with nor cares to learn.
I don't think that will stop casual use,  though. For example, I can imagine people might buy a little just to use as "petty funds" to pay for things on web sites.  But, to use bitcoin for more than "petty funds", it must get simpler.

That was to get rid of Americans so they don't have to deal with the US Government. That's not the same as trying to conform with US laws.
IMO, US laws go overboard.  Nobody can predict how well any company will perform.  So, the SEC cannot protect investors against bad investments.  The SEC also is not needed to protect a person against liars and cheats.  There are already laws for that.
So, the SEC can only create rules that make it more challenging for legitimate fund seekers. That's about it.

Personally, I have no financial interest in seeing Bitcoin take off.  I'm not one sitting on a pile of coins :-)
However, I nonetheless would like to see it succeed, as I see it as a far simpler transaction system than the existing establishment. Periodically, our business has to wire money internationally and it's a pain.  It more convenient than credit or debit cards, since I don't have to worry about my bank block my cards for some suspicious activity.  (Happens traveling internationally sometimes and it's absolutely infuriating.)  I'd love to be able to buy breakfast with my Android Bitcoin wallet.
I rarely write checks any longer.  Everything is paid electronically.  Still, those electronic payments are not always hassle free.  To pay for something on eBay or Amazon, I still have to enter credentials.  The merchants are still at risk that somebody stole my credit card.  I see bitcoin as that "next step" in electronic payments, making it easier for me to make payments and safer for merchants.  The fact transactions costs are lower is all that much better -- especially for those $30 international transfers and then money exchange fees.

I asked about this once. The contents I got back were interesting. One idea was that companies like Coinbase would settle many transactions off the blockchain when both the sender and receiver are Coinbase customers. They could have peering relations with some other companies, settling all exchanges daily or weekly.
Another idea was that the  blockchain would be truncated. There is no need for old data to remain on the blockchain if a given address has no bitcoins. So perhaps only addresses that have a balance and the last 200 blocks are retained. That would significantly reduce the size of the data files.

It doesn't have to be 100% random, so long as the random bits are at least, say, 90-bits or more.  A selection of truly random words also works, but nobody can remember a string of of long random words any more than they can remember a strong password of about 16 characters long.
My strategy involves written down random passwords hashed with a secret password that is not written down; specifically I use this:   That way, a real password is never written anywhere.  Passwords always require two "keys", basically.
Of course, somebody might be able to obtain the hashed value, such as by using key logging software.  If they're able to do that, they're able to get any kind of passphrase or password.
That's why having web sites use 2FA, where there is a trusted intermediary that can produce a one-time password used in conjunction with the usual password is very useful.  Not too many sites offer 2FA of some sort, but that trend is on the rise.

Even that can be applied to use of fiat currency.  The only thing that provides consumer protection is a credit card, and that is only made possible because everyone essentially pays a "tax" on every transaction.  Further, the merchant that accepts a stolen credit card is basically robbed of, not only the merchandise he/she sold to the bearer of a stolen credit card, but is often subjected to a recovery fee of anywhere from $10 to $25 depending on the merchant agreement.
There has often been discussion of escrow services to high value transactions to help protect consumers.  That's a reasonable way to go and I don't see this as a roadblock to successful bitcoin usage.
@_date: 2013-12-18 22:11:22

I think it's important to note that the illegal use of BTC can be equally applied to USD. It is well established that the USD is the most widely used currency for money laundering and drugs.  For that matter, "money laundering" is a stupid law that was created because the government could not actually prove that a real crime was committed. If BTC is used for truly illegal activity, as was apparently the case with Silk Road, then the government will eventually catch the person behind the illegal activity.  In fact, they stand a better chance with BTC than USD since there is a digital trail to follow.
I'm not blinded by great wealth, since I think I arrived way late to the Bitcoin party for that. Even so, I see a lot of potential in using Bitcoin.  Given the positive remarks I'm hearing from the US and Chinese authorities, along with widespread adoption and use around the world, it's has a bright future.
With Branson taking interest, Newegg hinting that it might accept it, etc. I think it's fairly evident that the path forward looks pretty good.  Already, it's possible to buy just about anything in the US via gyft.com.
I'm thinking $800 is not unreal.  The current market cap for BTC is about US$9.36B. That's a lot, but that's a small amount of money on the global scale.  Consider just one major company: Apple raked in US$37B in a single quarter.  So, the world-wide value of BTC is just 1/4 of Apple's quarterly revenue.  In other words, BTC is still a tiny amount of money.

I doubt this will happen. There has to be a reason to declare bitcoins illegal, basically. While the big banks might try to argue that Bitcoin is used for illegal activities, the fact is (and will likely remain) that the USD is still the king of the hill in terms of illegal activities. Importantly, the US Government is not the international authority over Bitcoin. It would take an international effort to shutter bitcoin. The big banks might try, but I think they would run a real risk of exposing their true intentions and it would backfire.
Besides, I think it makes a whole lot more sense for the big banks to get together and be the miners of the future.  Then they can dictate transactions fees, etc. The world's banks can control the bitcoin money supply.

However, it was Bitcoin that attracted me to Dwolla and I did hope that I could use the service for that.  Keeping the service only as a means of giving my son his allowance is hardly justifiable, so I'll probably cancel.  Really, I have no other use for Dwolla at all.

If you ran that on your own server, that would be a valid concern.  It would have to be secured.  However, if this is used on sites like Coinbase, then Coinbase would take precaution to ensure that the WebFinger database is not compromised.

The payments API is good for online-shopping. It looks like a reasonable way forward. However, I still think WebFinger can play an important role.
What WebFinger would make simpler is when somebody wants to send me money knowing only my email address. The user enters my email address and the wallet software issues a WebFinger query to get my bitcoin address.
What's presently shown in my example is static, but it would not have to be. For example, if I used blockchain.info as my wallet, I might put something like this into WebFinger:
    {
      "rel" : "
      "href" : "bitcoin:17XoqvUCrf12H7Vc7c7uDxib8FDMXFx2p6?request=
    }
Now, when the user enters my email address, they basically get back a payment API address.  I would assume the subsequent query the wallet makes to blockchain.info would contain the actual address to which payments should be sent (versus the static 17XoqvUCrf12H7Vc7c7uDxib8FDMXFx2p6).  If not, then we could simply do this:
    {
      "rel" : "
      "href" : "
    }
The expectation there is that this would return an address to which bitcoins can be sent.
I put this all together in a [new blog post]( that I hope might be helpful.

That's true, but given the ease of sending bitcoins, I can't imagine operators of such services would want to hold coins for a while for the sake of not increasing the size of the blockchain.  Granted, they might if the transactions are so small that the fees are not worth it.  But, l'm assuming most or all of these 500M/day are not pointless transactions.

It took 3-4 weeks before I got a reply to my inquiry.  I re-sent my KYC documentation and I guess it might be another 3-4 weeks.

Cold storage options are good, but they concern me. Things burn, things get stolen, paper fades, toner falls off pages, flash drives break, etc.  That's not to say cold storage is a bad idea, but I personally would not put my only copy in cold storage.  At the very least, I suppose put it in cold storage in multiple locations.
Another thing that concerns me about some cold storage options is the generation of keys.  I generated a key the other day using "vanitygen" that was rejected by bitcoind as an invalid key.  I made no mistake.  The key was generated in one SSH window and I was trying to copy and paste it into another SSH window.  Fortunately, it was a newly created address not targeted for use in cold storage, but it did give me reason to be concerned if there are some algorithms out there that are not generating correct keys.  I have not had this issue with vanitygen before, but now I will definitely validate any generated key before just assuming it is good.

I understand people might be upset with Mt. Gox, but the real evil-doer here is the US Government for taking $5M away from them. Seriously. If there were licenses and such that they needed, then the government should approach them and enumerate those requirements, not just take their money and point out where they are violating the law. Those laws exist for a reason, but it wasn't to prevent Mt. Gox from conducting legitimate business.
Anyway, folks might disagree, but I think we should cut Mt Gox some slack. They're trying to get into compliance with US law. I think the government ought to recognize that and return their funds. After all, "their funds" are actually the funds of people who have money at Mt. Gox.

Except that this literally does send an email, I think.  What I had in mind was that I could tell you to send me money to paulej for example.  You would just go to your client and enter that address.  It would perform a WebFinger query to coinbase.com and get an address to which to send money.  The rest works the same from there.
The nice thing about this is that if this became a normal part of clients, then it could be implemented consistently on any domain (Coinbase, Blockchain, Google, any business domain, or even your personal domain if you're so technically inclined).  I believe this would make using Bitcoins simpler for the average person.

It's a little more complicated than just being an arm of the government.  The 12 regional banks issue "shares" to the private banks.  Basically, the 12 Federal Reserve banks are controlled by the member banks.  Effectively, they "own" the Federal Reserve.  This "ownership" by banks in the Federal Reserve, by every appearance, means those big banks control the Federal Reserve.  This is a complex balancing act between the Federal Government, the US Mint, and the big banks.  At the end of the day, the banks control everything and if my memory serves, it was JP Morgan that was who led the charge to create the Federal Reserve.  Effectively, they are the beneficiaries of the nation's debt, member banks earn interest from customers, etc.  They literally control everything aspect of the economy.

No, I think they see an opportunity here.  After all, they're in the business of finance, not the business of US Dollars. And as a business, their goal is to profit.
With this new global money system, there will be many who do not have a clue how to manage their money (i.e., their secret keys).  Likely, they will need a bank to hold money for them.  And I'm sure they will be quite happy to constantly earn 2% converting currency.

Yes, it would take way longer than that.

As I noted to Loki-L, the user does not set up an email server.  The way I would expect it to work is their email provider would implement WebFinger, into which there would be a user-friendly way of entering one's bitcoin address.  Alternatively, when they sign up for a wallet somewhere (like Blockchain), Blockchain would provide them with an email-style address.  Email is not involved at all.  It's just an address that looks like an email address.
Users are now comfortable with sending stuff to user  Bitcoin address are extremely long and difficult for the average user, IMO.  Whether it's WebFinger or something else, "we need something my mother can understand."

Sometime over the past year or so, China proposed replacing the USD with a new country-independent currency. So, yeah... They do not want to soil their currency.

Right, so you don't share highly confidential information. There is no reason to provide a Coinbase rep with your full SSN, for example.  They don't need it and should not be able to see it.  There should be just enough information to address the customer problems, which are likely going to be "where's my funds?" or "who stole my bitcoins?!?" One should expect that customer service can see account balances and transaction histories, but not banking information, SSN, identity documents, or other personal data.

Try walking in to deposit $11K in cash.  You will be questioned.  They're obligated to report the transaction to the government.

So ate you taking the lesson learned an buying back in?

I didn't understand what you were suggesting, but what I was proposing is:
* I give my account identifier to you (e.g., paulej
* You put that into your bitcoin software when you want to send me money
* Your Bitcoin client issues an HTTPS GET to coinbase.com to get the WebFinger JSON object that corresponds to 'acct:paulej
* That JSON object would contain either an address or another HTTPS URI that would returns the address (the latter is useful for the proposed "payments" scheme being developed, but also allows for the JSON object to be static)
* With that query, your client now has my actual bitcoin address to which to send funds

This is good to know.  I personally think Coinbase has a very good chance at success, too.  The off-the-block chain transactions make a heck of a lot of sense, especially for enabling micro-payments.
The privacy aspects of transactions, quite frankly, are not much of a concern to most people.  So, I don't see that as a negative thing.  For the minority who care, they will always have the option to move a certain amount to their mobile phone wallet (as an example), perhaps via an easy-to-use mixing service first.
The beauty of Bitcoin is the fact that it can actually meet the needs of just about anyone.  If you want privacy, you can have it.  If you want to be your own bank, you can.  If you want to outsource your "bank" to Coinbase, you can do that.  Bitcoin makes it possible to truly implement a global micro-payment system, which I personally think is a major benefit that is not discussed enough.  As much as I hate "pay walls" when visiting web sites, I could actually tolerate one that allowed me to pay some petty amount in bitcoins.  And, it allows you to send money to anyone in the world in an instant.
It's unfortunate I didn't get into the game long ago, but I've definitely been sold on the benefits of Bitcoin.

Out of curiosity, are your transactions for purchases only, sales only, or both?  Perhaps they're concerned that you might be laundering money.  Still, they should give you an opportunity to explain.
Sadly, banks are put under pressure by the government to report everything you do with your money.  Try going down to the bank and depositing $10K.  They'll question you like you're a criminal.  It's truly pathetic.  As far as I can tell, the government does its very best to control every aspect of your life.  You're just middle class laborers who should be held to answer to authority and controlled.

Who wrote the software? It's not a violation of the GPL for the owner to re-license the software using a different license.

There is still a risk with that. Paper can fade, flash drives can be lost or destroyed.

Got it. Thanks for clarifying. Not sure how I missed that point.

Interesting you were in the queue before him. I think this only goes to prove that the company sends these out as a reaction to an attempt to get a refund.  What is their logic here?

The KYC laws are not there to protect exchanges. They're there so that the "terrists" cannot fund activities without the government then being able to track that after-the-fact.  (Yeah.. after-the-fact. The government really has no ability to prevent anything, but they do want to be able to provide people with an answer when something does happen.)
Mixing services are not a problem.  Your bank is the biggest mixing service in town.  They take all kinds of money, legal and otherwise, and mix it together. Your dollar likely has a trace of cocaine on it.  Really.
What is illegal is using mixing services for the purpose of hiding money used in an illegal activity.  But then that law exists only because the government wants to have two charges to throw at somebody: 1) the illegal activity and 2) money laundering.  The US Government (and state governments) seem to love making laws that make everything leading up to and after the illegal activity illegal to maximize jail time... which is why we have more people in jail per capita than any country in the world.
In the end, though, the KYC laws are there just to help track down who did what after-the-fact.

'The FBI initially seized over 26,000 Bitcoins. I asked the FBI spokesperson what the plan is for those cryptocoins. “We will download the Bitcoin and store them,” she said.'
Oh, that cracks me up.  The FBI downloaded the coins.  I believe a few people have "downloaded" those coins.

What explicit statement is there about it? Bitcoin is not officially recognized as either a currency or commodity by the laws of the United States. One court called it a currency, but during senate hearings it was referred to as a commodity, too. I think most would view it as money. People sell money, gold, and other things all the time.
So do they forbid virtual goods entirely?
Not being argumentative; I don't know what PayPal's policy states.

I think the latter part there is key. Few people around the world now really trust the US government. I'm a US person and I don't trust them much, either. When the government decides somebody does something illegal, proven or not, they'll just take away the person's assets. Without their assets, they can't really defend themselves very well. Add to that the fact that we've seen prosecutors lie so many times just to win... I've lost most confidence on the judicial system.

I'm not one of those people fortunate enough to have gotten into Bitcoin early, but I certainly would not discourage people from buying a little. Most people can't afford a large gold bar, either, which is why people sell smaller good bars like 5mg.
I think the high price of bitcoins should actually serve to support the currency. It clearly has a strong support base at this point. Value, while still speculative, should continue to grow with even more widespread adoption.
Further, while bitcoin might seem expensive, the total market cap is still less than Apple's quarterly profit. I'd say it still has a very long way to grow.

Well, you can't say that CampBX's price is not reflective of the market, because they are an exchange.  It is the market :-)  That said, their customer service is lacking.  I've been trying now for at least 6 weeks to get verified.  I've had one successful exchange with support and the reply was "we did not receive the KNC documents."  So, I sent it immediately and asked, "Did you receive them?"  Nothing.  CampBX is, from what folks have determined, perhaps just a two-person business.  But, gee... how are they supposed to get business if they demand KNC papers and then don't do anything with them?  I'm still willing to give them a chance, as I assume they're just overwhelmed, but they need to hire a dedicated person or two just to respond to support inquiries.  With 33,000+ customers, I think they should be able to swing it.
That said, I've used Coinbase and it's been great. "It just works."  I've not had to talk to support :-)

To be fair, businesses must price in fiat currencies. It's still too volatile to price in BTC. If the price of BTC changes overnight, you either scare customers away our you go broke, or both.
@_date: 2013-12-10 07:03:38
Actually, money flowing out into BTC should increase the value of the dollar. However, Bitcoin is still so small that it would not affect anything more than about, what?, five minutes of the government's printing press output?

Likely not, since you apparently entered the wrong start time. :-)
