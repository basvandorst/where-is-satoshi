Really? Tell that to Nvidia, they have market shortage due to miners. 
Sure you can use ASIC's or FPGA's but they are useless for anything besides mining. Reality is people like me have rig's for cryptoanalysis , not to mine.

It is that easy, long as you can buy GPU's. Any developer/sysadmin could set up a stratum long as they can follow instructions.

You can 'mine' more than cryptocurrency, you can sieve private keys for money, you can crack BIP32 recovery keys on lost wallet's for money. There is a lot you can do to make a profit with CPU or GPU.

I can't understand spending 11k on BTC, when you can spend that money on GPU's and setup your own stratum.

My point is it's better to sell shovel's during a gold rush then mine gold. I made more than what a decent miner makes just running a script and rainbow tables in a few week's recovering people's wallet's with BIP32 mnemonic passwords. 
How many ASIC's have you seen loaded with sha or scrypt? That's all they PCB will ever do. FPGA's are more useful but most aren't full programmable, Xlinix from my experience is the only manufacture that really allow's full reprogramming. 
You will make more money selling ASIC's or FPGA's on amazon to miner's than mining itself.

I can mine my own with my server's, I don't need to buy it. Also that wouldn't even be enough to move to any wallet.
