But people who have open futures contracts on the price at $11k also have the ability to buy a shit ton of bitcoin and can easily manipulate price to send the price down. They are playing with millions and millions of dollars, it is so easy for them right now!
The only thing making it worse is all of us “regular” people going along with it! Lol if nobody sold because they thought futures market would make us dip, it wouldn’t dip...but they see the initial sell off from Wallstreet types and start dumping.

Worth a watch...
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:40:38
Is there a maximum for the futures bet? Where does it say they are only putting down $20k (Or there about)?
I read something about them having to put down 4 or 5x what they are betting. They did that to help prevent people manipulating the market...but when it’s this easy to manipulate, is it really that much of a risk?

The right thing to do would be dollar cost average your way in....but if I was getting one, I’d just go all in lol to be honest with you ��
(This is not financial advice, the statement represented here does reflect the opinions of management) lol ✌�� good luck

Appreciate the in depth analysis, good work! ����
@_date: 2018-01-26 17:44:32
Great info! Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-11 05:22:50
����  Good team talk!

I believe it’s because of a large hack in Japan. Could be wrong...nobody knows anything, least of all me
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:43:14
I’m not following what you’re trying to say here...could you maybe explain a little more clearly 
@_date: 2018-01-29 10:44:52
Your uncle?? �� ooooookay ����
@_date: 2018-01-25 05:56:48
Do you need to buy a whole one in one go? Why not dollar cost average your way in over the coming weeks. $1-2k a week and see how it goes...it may come down again before we (potentially) really take off

So tell us what did you do about it to improve your position? How is it working out for you?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:05:40
Are you referring to Bitconnect? There’s advertisements for that online... I don’t know much about it, lots of people claim it’s a Ponzi scheme though.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:38:55
There’s a lot of anticipating going on here...lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:53:29
He gets it �������� I feel like a lot of people are unaware of this!!
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:01:36
Absolutely.... that video floating around on YouTube is a must watch for anyone concerned about the futures markets.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:55:16
This feed could get ugly... Lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:09:37
Lol ����‍♂️ you make it sound like a bad thing?!
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:17:57
Don’t panic....if you’re that worried and the money is important to you I would consider selling.
If you don’t need the money now and can wait a few months, hold...this market is pretty wild but should recover soon enough. You’ll get used to it!
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:22:17
Majority of alt coins prices are linked to BTC so it only makes sense.
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:17:05
Yea...I’m sceptical on this too lol would be good news though!
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:40:04
You should have never jumped off the train. Get back on ASAP and learn to either anticipate the dips or not panic sell! Good luck! ����
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:30:31
Fuck yea!! ���� stay strong!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:54:35
Looks like people taking profits from their alt coin gains over the past week and putting it back into BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:03:36
Absolutely...get your coins that you really like 3-6 and just hold onto those bitches for dear life! I was trying to trade and got burned too many times too...only really saw my money fly up when I left the shit alone lol ����
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:13:59
Exactly...nobody knows where the bottom or top is, it’s easy to say once the moment has gone that you should have bought/sold at a certain point.
There’s a ton of people who were selling at 10k saying it went up too fast and felt it was going to correct...missing out on the other $9.5k gains they could have made
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:29:51
Do you think it’ll never go back up? Or are you just trying to increase your stack? Dips are dips...we needed a correction. When it gets around $9-10k I’ll start dollar cost averaging my money in. Yolooooo!!
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:37:46
I literally just gave up trading... after losing a ton on the Lisk price movement today and having some bad luck in the past. I took all my coins off exchanges and even deleted blockfolio. No more refreshing that thing every 5 mins watching money go up and down like a lunatic.
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:11:27
Don’t beat yourself up about that...nobody can predict the future. Something could have caused bitcoin to go way down and you wouldn’t be complaining at all. You did what felt right at the time...don’t sweat it! We’re still early to this party in the long run ��������
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:45:12
Search under $ markets, not BTC markets. Top left hand corner of the home screen.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:44:52
That whole thread is amazing!! Lol thanks for sharing 
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:47:46
Got into crypto in June. I worked out how much I have put in and how much I would be up if I just left in the 3 main coins...BTC LTC and ETH...
At the moment I’m break even having invested in multiple Alt coins...would have almost doubled my investment if I had just left it.
Doing the math on that was certainly an eye opener!
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:00:39
Me too, even when we were going down I didn’t see him. Maybe last time we went down the cart came completely off the fucking rails lol glad to see him shooting upwards and loving life again ��
@_date: 2018-02-10 19:44:46
All crypto is linked to btc, including eth. Bitcoin was the first and is store of value.
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:01:42
Looks like a glitch, don’t panic!! Lol

The price of every other currency is measure in Satoshi’s. A Satoshi is a fraction of a bitcoin.
If my coin is 0.00051390 satoshis and the value of Bitcoin is $8130. Then my coin is worth $4.28 (roughly)
So if the value of bitcoin doubles and goes up to $16260 and the value of my coin stays the same, still 0.00051390, then as the value of bitcoin is higher, the $ value of my coin has also gone up and will be $8.51.
Basically everything is tied to the value of bitcoin. Bitcoin goes up, it all goes up, bitcoin goes down, it all goes down.
Best thing to do to see how your coin is performing against bitcoin is to check it in bitcoin value not $. Your coin may appear to have lost $ value but it may have actually gone up against bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:22:07
Lol fair point...I think maybe people would expect it to have some kind of correlation to crypto market...maybe people will take money from stock market and ride crypto up.
It’ll be interesting that’s for sure!
