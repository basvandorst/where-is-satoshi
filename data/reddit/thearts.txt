Just in time for retirement 8)
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:52:16
WTF did I just watch...
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:38:36
Holy crap me to. I didn't realize it wasn't Chapelle till I read your comment.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:16:27
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:46:12
that is exactly what I thought it was. In prep for January.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:09:24
I could be wrong, but from my understanding CPU mining doesn't add much hash power, but I guess anything helps.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:04:47
@_date: 2017-12-25 00:06:45
You left the ghostbuster trap on the table again.
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:00:27
A little here and there never hurts as long as you only invest with what you can afford to lose. I think learning how  exchanges work and also learning through experience is always nice.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:52:59
Exactly. I only have money I "can lose and be okay" invested in bitcoin, but seeing it tank made me sell at a real bad time. Just going to let it ride.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:41:02
This is my dilemma too! I feel like eventually maybe the other coins will catch up. But bitcoin is steamrolling.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:28:47
Wow sorry to hear, so messed up.
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:47:54
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:20:14
$61,568,000 if BTC is 13,000 a coin.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:49:58
This is my dream. Well done.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:21:03
Wow that is pretty huge if this a permanent thing for BofA. Quite a large bank here in the states.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:44:52
Ok cool cool, phew. TY for the context.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:14:21
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:05:11
What does this mean!?
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:26:33
Grats OP this is my dream.
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:39:54
The new one or the old one before you were a millionaire? Just kidding :) btc to the moon!
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:06:15
Yep! I've been trying not to stress, but that FUD...got to resist it! Be safe though.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:37:46
How huge? ELI5?
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:00:59
Sounds like a bad move imo. Goodluck.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:04:32
Very true if you look at it from that POV. If you think things are going to recover then this is a sale.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:01:51
Good points. I guess it is just a risk!
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:15:14
Me too! I'm in the pitch dark thinking wtf
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:30:04
This is me too brother, the life without student debt is the dream. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:18:04
Good man.
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:35:30
Honestly man, people can only speculate. No one truely knows. 
Have a safely net, be smart about it. There is no "minimum" amount you can put in, unlike stocks. Toss 10 bucks in and see how you feel.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:04:23
No, but I paint and play video games. I think I will do those more.
@_date: 2017-12-18 21:27:35
♫ You've got Bitcoin! ♫
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:33:14
Wait... so if someone uses BofA they can't withdraw money from coinbase?
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:50:40
Yep, I thought this would be going much worse. I am surprised at how much stability we are seeing.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:05:09
So true, it really is a fun ride. Probably the most exciting thing going on, history in the making.
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:19:44
You are not alone. HODL &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:30:23
Let me check my magic 8 ball.
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:12:50
Context, this was years ago when bitcoin was likely around 35 a coin.  
I thought it was only for dark web stuff and for people to buy drugs.  
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:20:56
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:40:42
I'd buy the dip if I had more cash :) I almost feel like taking a second job just for bitcoin LOL
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:05:43
That's a good point. Great place to get a general feel for the mood of things.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:51:50
Chicks want the digital seed.
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:03:38
Keep it up!
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:36:24
Yep wasn't my proudest moment.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:06:38
Me to friend me too. It is an emotional rollercoaster!
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:37:48
2013 they said the same thing. 2017 and we are going strong. That said, be safe only invest what you can lose and still be stable.
Btw bitcoin futures got approved. I'm on mobile, Google it brah.
@_date: 2017-12-07 10:16:29
Holding till it's at a point where my student loans are paid off. That'd be sweet liberation for me.
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:02:42
Stop I can only get so hard.
@_date: 2017-12-05 04:33:25
Coinbase is the most user friendly for beginners. It is very straight forward easy to start.
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:50:49
Mind sharing the platforms? You can PM if you'd be more comfy.
Thank you.
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:07:41
My life
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:51:37
Good idea on the unsubbing. 
I am in this for the long haul so I am just going to let it do it's thing and check in every once in a while.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:52:07
Good idea on the stop-loss. I should research that more.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:17:31
Please go to the moon so I can pay off my student loans please go to the moon so I can liberate myself. Bitcoin I trust you &lt;3
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:10:00
So going to watch this at work. 
@_date: 2014-01-18 22:22:35
Check out [Bitdazzle]( 
It is sort of like the Etsy of Bitcoin but they also sell Tech items.
I have a small Bitdazzle store of my art prints for cheap, about 10$ equivalent of Bitcoin a pop. [My Store](
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:31:20
It is guaranteed to be maybe.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:12:22
I would go with this if that was me. Yes 1k is 1/5th of your savings. You are young and can make mistakes and learn from them. I wouldn't put the full 5k in though (I am a bit more conservative.)
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:56:47
I am right there with ya man! I could've paid off my student loans if I had put just paid the minimum and put everything else in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:02:30
Diversify Diversify Diversify. I love bitcoin but please don't put all your eggs in one basket. Buy some stocks on Robinhood, buy some bitcoin, put some in savings.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:08:58
Not to get off topic. But it has been speculated that "wall street" has already been manipulating the shit out of bitcoin. Noone can prove this true or false.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:25:49
Welcome to the show!
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:30:04
Wouldn't we all! &lt;3
@_date: 2017-11-10 18:44:15
So do you still get the ammount coins at the price you bought that at?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:35:07
Eh playing it safe is the smart when we can't predict the future. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:00:16
Yup, I'd be happy with having made just enough to pay off my student loans, never mind getting a Ferrari!
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:55:04
This is exactly what I picture a redditor at the NYSE to look like. I mean that with love.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:28:25
You are not wrong, there is an o in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:57:42
Coinbase.com open an account attach your bank account or a debit card. Buy bitcoin. It is that easy.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:37:26
Guess I am one of the only ones that doesn't mind the fee for how easy and user friendly Coinbase is. /shrug 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:00:23
Invenst what you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:59:14
I wish. Cheaper coins!
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:54:52
But...but...the Millennials! We must generalize them into one basket! It's easier! \s
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:31:04
I have had 0 issues. Using them 2 years.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:31:03
Even if it did crash harder, many of us said the same thing in 2013 "damn I bought at 1k!" and look where it is today. HODL!
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:00:34
Yup, I'd be happy with having made just enough to pay off my student loans, never mind getting a Ferrari!
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:04:20
I know more people would be pissed, but as someone just getting in... that is my dream.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:03:26
I'll take one brisket please. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 23:59:52
Cloud Strife is pleased.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:33:58
I noticed this too, with a portfolio of mostly Tech stocks. I can't say it has a correlation by fact, but I find it hard to believe tech stocks going down would help bitcoin in any way, only neutral or negatively.
That said, I bought into the Tech dip on some of my holdings :) discount prices!
@_date: 2017-11-13 02:22:34
You are posting this in r/bitcoin, to be honest it really should be a mix of investments. I might get downvoted, a percentage should go into bitcoin for sure, BUT please add to your savings account and once you are 18 also open up an account on Robinhood and invest in the stock market as well. Don't put all your eggs in one basket. You will learn that one day the hard way or the easy way.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:13:34
Yep, I was in college and only thinking about beer money. I had put 50 bucks on bitcoin in like 2013 (about .5 btc), forgot about it, remembered in 2014 and was like "I can buy some stuff for the party this weekend, let me withdraw it all!" 
I could've paid off my students loans with just that in if I had cached out at BTC 20k  
@_date: 2019-04-02 20:17:20
What if you have a terrible memory and are sure you would lose your private key, so you'd rather Coinbase and Robinhood each hold onto your stuff?
