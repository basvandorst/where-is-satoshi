Only idiots buy bitcoins on coinbase or similar exchanges. Buying a crypto build for anonymity with an account linked to your bank and name defeats the purpose. ALWAYS buy bitcoin in cash, in person, and be careful who you buy from (Law inforcement do such transactions to do money laundering accusations)

it would not change anything about bitcoin, however the price could be impacted because casual investor who leave coins on exchange would be scared.

 There is a difference between a owning an asset and admitting that owning that asset might contain political, economical or other risks. I think what you mean is that bitcoin (and other public blockchain) escape the political risks when owning it. However there are some other risks like security(being stolen keys, forgetting passwords etc) and technological (encryption getting broken and other).

Will get down voted for that but ETH is a legitimate project which has been hit hard in this bear market. I would sell some btc to buy some more eth. The idea here is selling btc which is high compared to eth to buy eth which is cheap compared to btc, it's usually the good investment.  Also the market often rewards contrarian views.

Small is a relative term. 1300$ is not small when you only have 1 bitcoin. But it can be very small if you owns a few hundreds which many early investors do. Not because they were early investors that they are not guilible or financial geniuses.

At the point we are right now I would only consider 2 cryptocurrencies as really used currencies, BTC and BCH because they have adoption outside the crypto ecosystem. I have personnally used them both to buy things that are not crypto related.

There is no such thing as clean or dirty money, only money. Saying that some money is not ''clean'' because it as been used in activities that some goverment deemed bad hinder the value of said money in relation to other, its against the principal of fungibility- an essential part of money.
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:35:04
That's exactly right. You don't own the money you think you have in the bank. You are an unsecured  creditor of the bank (most states cover up to 100k if lost of deposits). The only money you own is the  bills you carry or the ones you have in a safe you own, not a rented one.

They probably only accept bitcoin through bitpay and don't even manage a wallet. Btc gets change into fiat and dropped in their bank account the next day. 
@_date: 2018-09-07 19:42:29
That's very small. In fact it's about the premium you pay buying gold. You would pay 5%+ for silver. And about 10%+ buying bitcoin anonymously.

This is an excellent answer in every aspect. Up vote and I want op to see that your not alone thinking exactly the same 
@_date: 2018-08-29 11:57:04
Shapeshift is the best exchange out there, no KYC no signup. I have used it hundreds of times and I would say that long waiting times only happened a few times (5-10) out of maybe 200+ transactions. I would often do many transactions at the same time on deferent browser windows to bypass the maximum per trade.
@_date: 2018-08-27 14:03:32
PayPal bans crypto related accounts anyway. That's not the way you buy bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-08-10 11:47:44
I'm glad actually that people that let their crypto on exchange lose it. If they let it on the exchange they don't understand crypto and they are not worthy of it. The idea behind Bitcoin wasn't to replace HSBC with Binance.
@_date: 2018-08-10 12:03:27
trading should only be done with small amounts that you are willing to lose, which is absolutely not the case here we are talking people depositing and storing their crypto on a exchange. Decentralized exchanges will solve some of that problem. The ''traders'' using their day doing TA on bitcoin are basically playing a casino game, there is no value added to what they do they just transfer some money from one to another giving a cut at the house which as very little impact on the actual price.
@_date: 2018-05-20 14:00:31

The people who got arrested for that are people that were doing this as a buisness. Like buying on conbase and selling cash at a premium. Its not illegal to buy bitcoin for cash casually.

Bitcoin was designed to be a P2P electronic cash system. Which was anonymous at first, put the responsability and the power into the hands of the individual (the user).

I'm anarcho-capitalist/voluntarist so I don't believe in goverment, be it Trump or any other president in any country. I'm just saying that it doesn't make sense from an economic stand point.

Yes I do. In fact OP said its account has not beed touch for 10+ days. If you trade that would not be a problem. You want to trade? You deposit fiat at 8am, trade at 8:15 and withdraw at 8:30 back to your wallet. You don't just leave your hard earned money in someone else's hands.

The only pattern there is to some very limited  extent is imitation. The guys who learned the same technical stuff react the same way.

@_date: 2018-10-17 21:01:35
100$ is a small amount for bitcoin, i find that bitcoin is way more useful for bigger transactions. I have moved high 5 figures amount in bitcoin and the most fees i paid was like 80$ in december 2017 but it was still a small fee relative to the amount.

Demand will diminish because price will be higher because of tariff. US could start making some products but usually when talking about China US won't be competitive.

Yes and who would lose thoses imports? american consumers and buisnesses. the average american is actually BENEFITING from the huge trade defecits with china and many other countries. It gives american consumers and buisnesses cheaper stuff when they produce nothing in value in return. Eventually what will happen is the US dollar will go down in value, therefore making every american poorer and making capital investment in factories profitable since the price of the workforce will be lower. That is the only way to reduce the trade defecit in the US.

you sell for cash in person in small amounts. Law enforcement agency will sometimes send agents make large cash crypto purchase to do blockchain analysis and money laudering charges.

People in 3rd world country have the highest birth rates. They make children and give them shitty lifes and few opportunity. Many possible reasons for this here are some explanations;
- birth control availability

@_date: 2019-01-23 15:31:26
1.5% to 2% is very small. You probably won't get better than that whatever you do. I have often done SWIFT wires for 80$USD. 
- buying bitcoin anonymously for cash will cost you around 10% generally
- buying gold bullion will cost you about 2%
- currency exchange vary between currencies but anywhere between 1-5%
- Buying silver bullion will cost you about 5-10% depending on the size
- International SWIFT wire transfers are about 80$ USD
- Sending cash in the mail will cost you shipping + insurance cost.

I never bought bitcoin on any exchange. I bought all my coins for cash from someone I knew  and from ethereum that I used to mine and traded on shapeshift on tor browser when they had no KYC.

@_date: 2018-02-28 20:50:04
1- you never buy bitcoin with wire transfers on exchanges like coinbase. Always use bitcoin ATM with cash or localbitcoins
2- never say on social media and other that you own bitcoins
3- if it is a relatively small amount, you can cash out progressively for cash, the same way you bought.
4- If its a very large sum, lets say hundreds of thousands you can buy gold with your bitcoins and let your gold stored offshore like in Hong Kong. Then you can sell some of your gold for a wire transfer in an offshore account. its preferable that the wire would be in anything except US dollars (euros, swiss francs). The account could also be belonging to a buisness you own or a foundation. 
5- You can now spend this money with a debit card. Large purchases like real estate should be made outside your home country or through shell corporations.

It could be for tax reasons. Also, you want as much privacy as possible dealing in cryptos. Current financial institutions are mostly hostile towards crypto. You also want privacy so people won't try the ''5$ wrench attack''
Bitcoin was made to be ''An anonymous peer to peer cash system''. When buying it with cards you defeats some of the point behind bitcoin. But nowadays I guess people aren't interested in the principle, just making a buck.

I would also add that even if most drugs are illegal in most countries and its enforce harder then before, it has never been easier to get theses drugs. Making something illegal doesnt stop people from getting it. Ultimately the people chose what they want, be it legal or not.

Common people get caught by buying fancy cars and homes they wouldnt be able to afford on their disclosed income.

They will only look at big trackable transactions like cash deposits, car purchase, real estate, plane trips and so on.

Bitcoin was first adopted by the anarchist/libertarian community. So you should expect theses people to be against taxation, and that is the people who owns the most bitcoins. Secondly, being honest is admitting that theft is immoral, be it committed by an individual, a corporation or a government. As such, the income tax is theft since its taking property from an indiviual or a corporation without his/its consent. The only solution to this is repealing the income tax or make it voluntary, that means repealing the income tax.

swift international wires are around 80$ if they permit you to send that much out of your country

If you had a real "wallet" no 3rd parties could block your funds.

I would say to stay away from coinbase because of KYC however there are plenty of other reasons regularly listed here also. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 19:00:42
Perfect I hope it's stays that way. Not such thing as clean or dirty money. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 00:01:02
I believe in btc but havent bought it in years and its not because i dont have money.

A couple of point regarding my situation. My will is relatively simple, because;
1- I don't have any children
2- I'm not married
3- I don't have a large family and even without a will the money will go to the right persons (my parents mostly)
4- my will isn't notarized because I'm still young(ish) and all the reasons above.
5- I don't only own bitcoin and I'm not savy enough about multi-sig wallets.
@_date: 2018-12-12 13:34:30
a few millions if talking from ath. I'm still up overall though.
@_date: 2018-12-22 18:41:05
thats why you sell the bitcoin for cash in the first place, no exchange, no kyc. Another option is to buy your stuff directly with bitcoin
@_date: 2018-12-20 03:31:56
Buy at atm or p2p cash 
@_date: 2018-12-21 00:33:15
Just sell on Localbitcoins.com? 
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:18:24
if people are scared, then the rally will be sold into. Its more difficult to go up now because we have to climb that wall of worries.
@_date: 2018-12-12 20:39:37
thats exactly what you don't do, trade outside the site.
EDIT: just looking at the link and the guy trades on Paypal, that immediately is a huge redflag because of chargeback and would avoid like the plague.

I have back ups at some family members. They are encrypted but the decryption key is in my will. 
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:57:42
All exchanges are bad due to KYC, and goes against the principle of bitcoin: a P2P electronic cash system.
Replacing the word ''bank'' by ''exchange'' which censor people on the same KYC/AML or country of origin rules is pointless. Transacting electronically with each other without 3rd party is the real magic. We already have cash for P2P in person transactions.
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:09:21
Of course that I agree.

The millionnaires created are the people who trade with your money, not their and take a commission for it.

The movie is entertaining but you shouldn't take any advice from a fraudster lol

Still too many shitcoins aren't dead yet. Bear market is not over. It might be in bitcoin but I don't think it is on a global coinmarketcap perspective. 
@_date: 2018-12-13 00:32:34
its Bitconnect 2.0 better and improved version!
No really its just a scam. Thats what socialist goverments do, scam their own people.

@_date: 2018-12-27 13:40:02
Buy P2P and receive with a real wallet. Coinbase is not a wallet. With a wallet no one can put your money on ''hold''
@_date: 2018-12-13 13:38:10
too many people own a bitcoin, 21 would be more interesting. 100 btc even more
@_date: 2018-12-21 01:55:06
This is exactly on point. It needs to be on top for for all thoses looking to buy bitcoin with PayPal, credit card and no fees with all the KYC in the world.
@_date: 2018-12-05 14:48:21
The futures allows people to bet on bitcoin without actually having bitcoin. In that sense, in can have the effect of reducing demand for real coins.
@_date: 2018-12-22 23:20:40
I bought stocks, gold and I have some shares in private businesses also on top of my crypto holdings. I always had that (before crypto) and always will. I don't own much local currency at all and don't own real estate at the moment because of the current debt/real estate bubble (I have owned real estate in the past). 
@_date: 2018-12-12 23:39:04
he is screwing around. This is a scary motherfucker that guy.
@_date: 2018-12-17 21:16:05
I knew about bitcoin before it went to 1200$ in 2013. I didn't buy precisely because I said to myself that I had missed the boat on that one and the price was rising too fast. Well you know what when it crashed to 200$ I bought my first coin cause I felt it was a ''fair'' price. So I totally understand people not buying because they ''missed'' the boat. However we are maybe close to a good buying opportunity, who knows.
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:28:28
PayPal is reversible therefore trading bitcoin for PayPal is high risk so most of the time you would get scammed or pay a high risk premium. 
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:41:22
We already have paper money for costless in person anonymous transactions. 
@_date: 2018-12-30 03:16:15
That's the correct way of buying bitcoin. No exchange no KYC. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 14:12:24
Bitcoin was created has digital cash, anonymous. KYC goes against one of the core principle of Bitcoin. See what Andreas Antonopoulos thinks about KYC. Some exchanges dont require KYC for trading crypto/crypto within X amount per day.
@_date: 2018-12-16 21:05:29
Technical analysis is bullshit. 50 euro is not worth the time anyway. Better to have 50 euro worth of bitcoin than 0 though. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 20:31:52
You're too poor to use bitcoin. If you went to localbitoins or atm and you bought a few coins you could buy anything you want without any ID, no verification and more privacy than a credit card. That's what bitcoin is about. Your bad experience is due to you not having enough currency and dealing with 3rd party (exchange).
@_date: 2018-12-01 19:21:43
Rip Mr Lahey.

robinhood is only to bet on bitcoin. not to actually buy bitcoin.

Not here.

whales aint tricking anybody. this is conspiracy bs right here.
@_date: 2018-12-01 22:52:56
Just buy at an atm for cash or use p2p like Localbitcoins.com 
@_date: 2018-12-02 23:54:17
It was in the beginning until companies figured out to do chain analysis. You can have a binance account without KYC and trade 2 btc per day. Shapeshift used to let you trade no KYC also. There is also hitbtc but I would be careful with that one. If you want fiat gateway you need to go bitcoin atm, Localbitcoins.com, bisq, paxful and craigslist. 
@_date: 2018-12-02 01:36:16
Climate change all the time. It's bullshit 
@_date: 2018-12-01 01:09:18
I think it's peercoin which was one of the first if not the first proof of stake coin. 
@_date: 2018-12-16 20:13:30
That is a very legit PayPal trade, no scam which is surprising you should never trade bitcoin on PayPal to begin with. 
@_date: 2018-12-15 14:22:42
very nice
@_date: 2018-12-20 14:12:43
No exchange is good for buying bitcoin. The only good way is to trade p2p for them or mine them, the second isn't really an option anymore.

You have to include equipment cost and depreciation. So no its not profitable at 0.06$/kwh.
