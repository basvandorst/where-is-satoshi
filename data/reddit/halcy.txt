the bitcoin reddit statement of the month
@_date: 2014-10-05 13:25:16
It's really funny how the interests of people who want to make money _off_ bitcoin, who post threads like these, are somewhat opposed to the interests of anybody who would like to use bitcoins to... actually buy things.

Best practices: Do not store money on a probably terribly insecure computer you set up yourself, instead convert money into dollars right away.

Or maybe he's just a moron. You know, like a lot of the people who run bitcoin-related websites.
@_date: 2014-04-08 02:07:42
It's potentially worse than that, still, for some bitcoin-related services.
Since this reveals fairly random memory batches, if the server has anything that may compromise the services wallet in memory, that may leak. Same for usernames / passwords.
There is no indication of people actively exploiting this yet, so probably no reason to panic (beyond the part where storing money on a computer system that is connected to the internet is just generally a reason to be constantly in a state of panic), but updating ASAP is definitely advised - and then changing every private key, SSL or bitcoin or whatever, and possibly other credentials (passwords etc) and secret information that the server may have had in memory, to avoid potential terrible damage later on.
edit: I should say that this is all for servers, mind you. While a malicious server exploiting a client is possible (I believe, I am not familiar enough with TLS), that direction is rather less likely because it is more of a pain and a less nice target.

When anybody promises you free money, "probably a scam" really _is_ the reasonable assumption, wouldn't you say?
@_date: 2014-03-06 14:48:01
Nonsense. A bank and credit card companies have processes for resolving disputes and detering fraud. Bitcoin doesn't.
@_date: 2014-05-16 23:43:45
No. "But your time is worth more" type arguments are usually nonsense - you cannot magically conjure up paid work whenever it is convenient.

I do not want to buy Bitcoins. I want to buy things, using bitcoins. I do not _care_ about bitcoins, beyond that they could be a great tool enabling me to buy and sell things without having to pay too many fees, from anybody, or maybe to do cool things that I can't even think of right now, but at no point in the process are bitcoins a thing I wish to own more than I wish to own any other currency. For me, the exact "price" does not matter, but the fantasy based pricing driven rollercoaster that is "bitcoin investing" does. 
I really do somewhat hope that the price crashes and that people using bitcoin as an "investment" rather than as a tool to do things move on to something else.

He claimed that Megaupload was not a project of his and tried to pay off websites to not mention him in connection with it before, but then, if it was him trying to be quiet about a new scam or whatever, he'd probably not call it anything with "mega" in the name.
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:35:16
Just what bitcoin needs - attention from high-profile criminal scammers.
@_date: 2015-01-20 10:58:01
Funny how the english internet has so little mention of how he, well, got out of the whole running a caling card fraud scam and piracy bbs thing by selling out everybody he worked with and all his users, data and all, to the police, and then worked for one of germanys most notorious antipiracy lawyers for a while.
It really is a marvel of modern branding that people keep trusting this guy.

I like my money to be secured by it being not a file on a computer, or at least being a file on a computer of someone who is actually good at security and responsible when shit happens and not some anonymous dude in china.
That has worked out pretty well for me, thus far. Certainly better than the twice-weekly "oh god somebody made a website with bitcoins but it is not safe" thing going on here.
@_date: 2012-08-15 21:49:38
Your e-mail verification is like, 
That's maybe not a good idea! Anybody can create any amount of accounts for any mail address! And no captcha, so they could automate it, too! In light of giving new signups 0.1btc, that seems worrisome!
Worse, your app uses seems to use GET requests throughout and doesn't use any kind of MAC, it doesn't look like even a simple referer check is in place! That makes XSRF so easy it's not even funny anymore. ***I could literally make a website that, when someone visits it while logged in, transfers all the bitcoins from that users account to some address***, or even just a fake image that someone could embed on forums where external images are allowed that does the same thing.
It took me about 10 minutes from first opening your website to finding all of that, I'm sure there's more gems hidden in there. I don't think your website is at all secure and I am not sure you understand security at all.
**edit:** You send verification mails for withdrawals, but... the mail address can be changed via XSRF too! Also the password! Making noticing what's going on hard, and acting upon it harder!  And you don't seem to send verification mails for that! Or, since you log in by mail address, someone could just steal accounts outright, I guess that's easier! What the hell I didn't expect _that_ to work so I didn't even try at first! Just shut your site down and go do something else before someone gets hurt!
**edit 2:** I CAN SET TWO ACCOUNTS TO THE SAME MAIL ADDRESS?? I... am spent what the fuck is going oooooon this is a complete clusterfuck
@_date: 2012-08-16 05:22:33


That's no verification! I can just pick any mail and put it there! It doesn't have to be mine! It doesn't even have to be valid!


It is not, and you're not using double submitted cookies, nor any other prevention mechanism.


Earlier, I did, so apparently I can - could, really, since you quick-fixed that, but in the process... (see edit)
(Different reply)


That does not matter for this kind of attack. Tricking someone into visiting a website where it is possible, maybe one you control, or even one the user trusts (think facebook or myspace or any forum that allows signature pictures) suffices. 




Now, this is the part that is most worrying, really. Your reaction. Making a website that is supposed to handle peoples money, but is so insecure someone without any special training can break it in a matter of minutes is already not great, but then flat-out lying when somebody goes out of their way to - for free, as a service to you and your customers - point out problems in your setup is not just rude, it is also highly unprofessional.
Admit you screwed up, shut down to prevent any further damage, and go hire someone who can patch your system up.


Oh man, I should start charging people those kinds of rates! I'm not very good, either, but if I'm better than a 90 bucks per hour guy, I could easily charge a hundred!)
**edit:** Also your mail quickfix is not only broken, it dumps SQL errors to users, leaking info about your db scheme... and you don't use prepared statements or anything else so I could just SQL inject there! Or... anywhere else, really, it turns out?? Your site is open to all kinds of trivial attacks, I find it hard to believe that nobody noticed that in MONTHS and that your "90 bucks/hour" security consultant didn't catch that.
I'm not going to get any further into this. Christ. 
I'd say "...unless you give me a lot of money for it", but you don't seem to be the kind of person I'd want to do business with.
@_date: 2015-04-15 18:43:31
So, what you're doing is providing a means to commit copyright infringement for money? Like, you're screwing people who make stuff out of money to make some for yourself?
Amazing. 
@_date: 2015-04-13 14:49:05
Maybe what you perceive to be "anti-bitcoin" is in reality "wishing bitcoin to be good in some way or other, but being very angry at the state of it and the community and ecosystem around it", and/or disagreement of what cryptocurrencies can and should do.
That, and quite frankly, some comments on reddit bitcoin are so far out that it's a bit hard to keep serious.
@_date: 2015-04-15 21:17:22
So, apparently in reddit bitcoin, you get downvoted for pointing out what the common use case of a _paid_ service - "obtain content without the content creator seeing a dime, but without the risk of getting caught" - is, as long as that service is being paid for with bitcoins.
Mind you, download torrents through that service as much as you want, use it, I don't care - but be aware that when you _pay_ for piracy, you are paying money to leeches, to people who contribute nothing and profit of other peoples work, instead of people who actually make stuff - and with that, all the "wouldn't have bought it anyways" types of excuses are off the table.
@_date: 2015-04-16 12:22:55
Years and years of greed? Not every, nor even I would think the majority these days, of people who create works that are for better or worse protected only by IP law (people who write software, be it custom-made, consumer, or open source, people who make music, be it for for direct release or for inclusion in some bigger thing, people who write, be it books, technical manuals, web pages, whatever, et cetera), are part of some big corporation or rights society or w/e.
I certainly agree IP law as it is now is inadequate in all its forms. Software patents are complete madness, copyright terms are extremely long, actually defending yourself against somebody who has more money than you taking your shit and selling it is extremely hard, fines are such that many services would rather err on the side of taking things down plenty, ... - reform is as desperately needed as it is unlikely. However, the general idea that *people who do work ought to have control over the things they create, even if those things are easy to duplicate once finished* is a sound one.
@_date: 2015-04-16 13:16:09
There is no "war" here, and you're conflating for-private-use piracy and infringement as a business - such as when some guy takes another persons music and starts selling it, when some agency takes somebodys photo off flickr and uses it in an ad, when a clothing manufacturer sells shirts with pictures off deviantart, when a router company takes a strong-copyleft software package and slaps it on their routers but refuses to contribute back, and: when a company lets you give them money to let you pirate stuff. The former is a fact of life (but alternate compensation models exist and work - as it turns out, creative people are creative), but the latter is _quite_ stoppable.
@_date: 2013-04-12 12:40:19
Obviously not.
@_date: 2013-11-16 16:51:49
A different perspective: Maybe many MORE people would be involved with bitcoin if scamming and tax evasion weren't so terrifyingly easy. I can't wait for the day when bitcoin will become actually useful for me, assuming it ever does, and actually having some working way to combat scammers is a bit of a neccesity for that. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:05:47
By which you mean "around 640$", after taking mtgox being unable to not fuck up for once (or, if you prefer conspiracy theories, FIXING THE PRICE!!11!!) into account.
