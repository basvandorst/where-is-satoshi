You are completely right. Unfortunately, I think this is not how people's psychology works. People tend to show off only good things and keep bad things to themselves. When average Joe sees his neighbor talking about how he made some money on an investment (he won't tell you that he also lost a lot before), our average Joe thinks he has no time to research the investment for himself because he might lose the opportunity. So many people were posting information about crypto on Twitter, Facebook, etc. Most of them thought they were smart to earn money on this crypto bull market (one would be dumb to not earn money in this bull market when prices of almost every coin skyrocketed)

You are right. Maybe many people started with what they could afford to lose. However, after seeing this rapid increase in prices, they just kept adding more and more funds because of greed. I really hope it works out for everyone.

Many people also don't understand stock market, but it is fancy these days to tell everyone that they should invest in something. People who do not understand stocks, invest in Apple, Google, Facebook and other blue chip companies. People who do not understand crypto, invest in Bitcoin....some in Ethereum and Litecoin. 
I don't see anything wrong with people trying to make money. No matter how much you learn about stocks, real estate, bonds, crypto, etc., it is never enough because many factors still are not under our control. We are all gambling (some invest what they can afford to lose, others go all-in).

People are panicking now because they bought it for 17k-19k and now they are losing their money. Just because the price went up after previous so called "dips," it doesn't mean it will happen again.
I never understood people who wanted their investments to decline in price so they can just buy more of it.  Do not blindly throw your dumb money in the markets after smart money just because the price went down. In the end, you can and probably will get burned by thinking that you are "cost-averaging" your investments. 
I hope no one feels like they are experts just because they made some money on cryptocurrencies. You would be really dumb to not make money in this hyped bull market (I am not saying the increase in price is fair or unfair). Just hope that your investment will bring the highest ROI you hoped for and when you think you achieved it, just find another great opportunity instead of waiting for the price to go down so you can buy more of the same. 
This is my opinion and I would love to hear other people's opinions (not hatred and blind HODL AND BUT ON DIPS).

When it goes up, people who couldn't ride it, want a dip so they can buy cheaper and enjoy the same gains (in hindsight, no one likes lost opportunity). 
When it goes down, people who could ride it, scream that the 'bubble' has popped because they either lost some of their gains or even their principal since 30% decline requires 43% increase in price just to break even (in reality, no one wants to see the big and bold number on their Blockfolio/Coin Profit/etc. app to decline). 
Both groups have smarts and dumbs. The sad part of the story is that we don't know which ones we are until it is too late.

Most people heard of Buffett's "Be fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful," and now everyone thinks they are the professional investors. Stop posting the same "advice." There is so much behind investing, including luck, but you all just keep repeating the same phrase you heard on TV.

No, you don't understand what I am saying.
The parallel with BTC and stocks (mostly because BTC doesn't provide products or services) is not great but I will try to show you what I mean.
If you buy the products/services of Apple, Microsoft, Tesla or any other company, then you are supporting them by providing your capital for their products/services. If you buy the shares of these companies, then you do not really support tech just by investing in tech. If not you, someone else would own these shares anyways. They are there, and it doesn't matter if you own them or your neighbor, or any other SMALL investor. 
If you are buying BTC and then sending them to your Nano Ledger cold wallet, you aren't supporting any cause besides your dreams to become richer. It is like holding the shares or U.S. currency and thinking that you are helping the company or economy. 
However, if you do things, such as accepting BTC in your own business, educating others about it (not just HODL, to the moon, etc.), asking other businesses to use it by showing them how it benefits them, building amazing things on top of the BTC platform, and yes, by writing code as well, then you are supporting the tech.

Blockchain might be something that is not corrupted and easily manipulated, but the ecosystem around cryptocurrency, such as exchanges, ICOs, public figures, different projects have shown that as of now, they all might easily be manipulated.
@_date: 2018-06-25 19:28:28
Well, by buying and holding BTC, you aren't really helping the tech. If it wasn't you, someone else would be owning the same BTC. It is like any shares of any company. If you own 1 share of Apple, it doesn't mean you support Apple. Someone would own it anyways.

Or 15 years ago, or 30 years ago, or 50 years ago, or 1,000,000+ years ago.... Nothing, you could have bought something to eat with it at least.

Or it might turn them away from this tech. After 2008 bubble, many people were scared to buy houses and only preferred to rent. They felt the pain of losing their homes and it is harder to persuade them now that this time everything is different and bubbles won't happen again, which in capitalism is impossible due to the cyclical movements of markets.

What can you buy with BTC? How is it an excellent medium of exchange? As of this moment, what can you purchase with BTC? Do you know what medium of exchange is? 
Store of value? This cryptocurrency is so volatile. In my opinion, there are two options; one shows that BTC can be a great store of value and one shows that it is shit as a store of value.
1). If you can purchase many things with BTC and you do not need to convert them to USD, then it is a great store of value since it was built to be a deflationary coin (which is not really good for economy in general, but it is another story). Example: you have 1 BTC and it equals to 1 BTC. Today, you need to buy bread and it is 0.5 BTC, in 1 year it will cost 0.4 BTC. This is good. 
2). This case scenario is bad for BTC as a store of value, if you need to convert it to another currency to purchase something. 
Example: You have 1 BTC you bought for $10 yesterday and you need to convert it to USD today because you can't buy anything necessary for everyday life. Today, when you convert your BTC, it might be $2, or $10, or $50. In this case, it is not a good store of value, since this is merely a speculating. 
In general, if an asset is very volatile, it is not a good store of value. If you put your $10 under your pillow and then check it one day and you see you have only $2 left and then another day it is $50 dollars, then it means your pillow is not a good store of value. The same with BTC, as long as it "attached" to fiat money and the price keeps jumping from one extreme to another, then it is not a store of value. It is a mere speculation.

For fucks sake, it is time for you to define what Bitcoin is: currency or asset? The OP is comparing Bitcoin to Venezuelan Bolivars, which means he or she is defining it as a currency. In this case, Bitcoin is worthless as currency since it doesn't fully satisfy any of the prerequisites needed to be called a currency, which are medium of exchange, store of value, and a unit of account. If you think it is a currency, then comparing it to USD is a waste of your time. You might say shit about the system that supplies the USD, such as Federal Reserve, banks, etc., but comparing currency (BTC) against currency (USD) is completely retarded.
If you think BTC is an asset, then I would want to hear from you what makes it an asset and I will gladly take my words back. Give us some of your non-retarded ass logic. If you can't, then fuck off!

Correct. However, you don't earn a dollar and sit on it for 15 years. You either spend it right away, invest it in something relatively safe (banks, U.S. Treasury) to decrease the effect of inflation, invest in something more risky, such as stocks, real estate, alternatives, or even start your own small business. There are many ways to keep up with inflation. I think that many people are not literate enough to know how to avoid inflation, but at least they can do something with the currently available currencies unlike the one whose owners just keep saying "HODL, To the moon, I am in for the tech."
With fiat money, you can at least predict inflation most of the time. With BTC, if someone bought it 7 months ago for $20,000, now that person has the same amount of BTC but only $6,500. In the end, if he/she wants to spend money, he/she will have to convert it in dollars, which means a loss of $13,500 in 6 months. I think this is much worse than our usual inflation in fiat currency.

You are correct. However, we are talking about our Average Joe who heard of BTC only when it peaked recently. Only the die-hard fans and people close to tech knew about BTC for the first years of BTC existence. 
We are saying that inflation is bad for our Average Joe, but BTC also screwed with him well. 
This tech has a lot of potential. It just needs to be more stable and usable. Otherwise, why would anyone buy something so volatile and not usable in everyday life besides for speculation reasons?

May I ask if there are any reasons why you chose exactly those numbers? Is that what your research says or just another random guess?

He does. The money he is losing right now could be spent/invested on other things that would actually bring more money. Maybe look up "opportunity cost?"

"It already is" is a complete opposite of "Bitcoin will be the future currency on the internet" lol
I would take Jack's words with a grain of salt. He is also the one controlling Square payment processing systems, so he has his own agenda in all of this shit.

It actually is. I have been using it for 4-5 years and had 0 issues with them.

I know that BTC has been around for 10 years. I am asking you why did you include that in your previous message to the other person? How was it relevant? 
Could you explain to me what Bitcoin is if it is not a business? Is it a currency, commodity or something new that we have never had?
@_date: 2019-02-18 01:22:55
Why specifically 10 years and not 15 or 5? 
And yes, every business starts with just $0.

Rat poison can make you a lot of money. For example, if you sell rat poison to people who have problems with rats and other rodents. It doesn't mean it is for everyone and if it is any good.

Warren Buffet didn't have this power when he started investing. He amassed his fortune and now people respect his opinion and therefore buy what he buys.

These types of memes get a lot of upvotes on this subreddit. Is it because people actually agree with these baseless statements or because they are funny?

How did it work? How did the salesperson explain to his boss that he/she accepted BTC instead $?
