As a start, you can encrypt it with gpg on windows.  Here's a short guide.

I think you are right about this attack being for revenge.  However, I do think what I described above could be motivation for a real attack, as long as mining pools are centrally organized.
It is all about probability and comparative advantage of different hardware.
Top of the line GPUs can easily top 1ghash/s, while an older dual core cpu like my server can get 1-1.5mhash/s.  I assume that the majority of botnet machines are in the 1mhash/s range, but you probably don't get to use the full cpu.  If you have a bot net of ~1000-2000 average machines, you might get a the equivalent of a top gpu.
This attack is only viable if the mining pool has a centralized point to attack.  I am assuming that the individual miners work independently, but the the work must be verified by the central servers in order to keep track of payouts (is this a valid assumption?).  
If you manage to take out the central servers, you would temporarily stop the entire pool from mining since the central servers can't verify the work and claim the blocks.  There are ways to make a more decentralized mining pool, but then you have to devote more computation to cross-checking the work of your peers to make sure nobody is trying to cheat the system.
For every miner you stop, your chance slightly increases (along with everyone else still mining).  If you have X% chance mining coins, and you take out someone with Y%, then your new chance X'=~(1+0.01\*Y)\*X.
So let's set up a little scenario:  (these numbers are completely made up, but illustrate the point)
The attackers have 1000-2000 shitty machines, with a total chance is 0.0001% since they suck at hashing
The attackers also have a much smaller pool of decent mining machines with a total chance of 0.01%.
The pool being attacked has 2%.
If it is possible to knock the pool offline with the shitty machines, the probability of success with the others becomes:
X' = (1 +0.01 * 2) * 0.01 = 1.02*0.01 = 0.0102%
This would double the effectiveness of the shitty machines.
With a little work, you could derive an algorithm to allocate machines to ddos vs hashing in a way that would maximize your chance of success.

It is a risk.  The value is not stable, there are major trust issues with the exchanges, and there are several legal hurdles on the horizon.
It is a gamble, but so are all investments.
If you call Bitcoin a ponzi scheme, you are just telling everyone that you are ignorant of how bitcoin works.

No, the work done in mining is actually verifying the integrity of transactions.  When all the coins have been mined, the network will rely on transaction fees for the hashing work to be done.

Woke up and checked Dwolla, Pending...
Checked Bitcoin, over $10... fuck.
When it's down, it's never long enough for Dwolla.  Probably means I'm just too slow to start the transfers.
@_date: 2011-08-03 22:50:28
That is troubling.  When did they rollback?
I'd still say mtgox is the safest third-party, but they are far from perfect.
I would say the recent Dwolla incident highlighted the immaturity of the market best.  Where everyone is trying to avoid accepting liability for fraudulent trades.  That is the service an exchange provides.

Well there was the guy who almost got rich mining 25,000btc and then had them stolen.
@_date: 2011-08-04 09:05:07
This is not required to actually use bitcoin, but they have the program store the entire history so you can completely verify a transaction back to when the coins were mined.  This way you can spot if someone is trying to use fake coins.
Eventually they will rewrite it to hash most of the transactions instead of keep the entire chain.
@_date: 2011-07-20 02:03:36
Without looking deep into it, I'd guess it's a mining pool or an exchange.  They commonly have large pools and lots of smaller transactions.
Edit: Disregard this, I misread OP.

The idea of an e-wallet is that you can access your coins safely and remotely.  If you can't transfer coins in and out, then it won't be very appealing.
In this case, you are placing all of your trust in the encryption of your wallet, which is perfectly reasonable.  But, if your faith is entirely in the cryptography and not the bank, why not just store your encrypted wallet in your private dropbox or something?
I would also add that the weakest point in this plan is storing the private key to decrypt the wallet.  You need to keep that as secure as an unencrypted wallet.  If you have a good scheme for keeping that secure, then why not use that for your wallets.
A bank gives you a lot of convenience.
What we need is reputable e-wallet services which are legitimately registered businesses, transparent, and have publicly known owners.
Bitcoin is an amazing currency which will have a huge impact in what we will expect from a monetary system.  It does not immediately invalidate all of our economic traditions like trust based banking.
@_date: 2011-08-10 18:45:08
I agree.  The problem comes down to nobody wanting to take liability for fraud.  They are running a currency exchange, accepting liability is their job.

If you successfully ddos the pool, you could reduce the overall difficulty.  Since the hashing hardware is getting sort of specialized, I imagine that most botnet computers wouldn't be that good for mining.  If the the attackers have a good mining setup as well, using the botnet to ddos other miners *might* improve their odds more than using the botnet to mine.
That's the only thing I can think of, and I don't know enough about the numbers involved to say if it is a reasonable guess or not.

Once Dwolla gets your money, it should take a few hours to send it to mtgox.  If you use Dwolla to pull directly from your bank account to mtgox, that takes an extra day or two from my experience.  Using Dwolla will take a few days.
The fastest way to get btc is buying them directly from another user, but that can be risky.
@_date: 2011-07-01 21:40:24
I just heard the mtgox press release on the [bitcoin show](  The old passwords were hashed but unsalted.  The active accounts were salted.

Here are some of the better passwords: 
If this db wasn't plaintext, then the attackers would need rainbow tables with mixed case, numbers, and specials up to 18 characters.  I doubt this db was hashed.
Also, why is this being hosted by another exchange?  Are they hoping it makes them look trustworthy or something?
@_date: 2011-08-03 20:07:44
Can you show me where they are lying and continuing to use bad code?
Since the hacking incident, they have gone to great length to ensure they are following all the latest security practices, and even going as far as introducing hardware security.  Can you show me an e-wallet place that offers two-factor authentication?
I don't like the fact that everything in the exchange is done with "mtgox bitcoins", which allowed the attackers to flood the exchange.  I think they've secured things enough to prevent that from happening again, but I'd like to see them introduce an e-wallet service which wouldn't be susceptible to this.

Thanks for the Zynga article, I hadn't seen that.  I know there has been recognition of other virtual assets in video games, but they were always been tied up with the copyright/IP of the game company.
I'm not arguing against virtual property or bitcoins as virtual property.  But, it will have to go to court, as with zynga, before it is actually recognized.
It's clear that they have value and are property, but it wouldn't be the first time the courts ignored the obvious.  The zynga case hinged on the fact that you had zynga as a central authority/issuer.  With no such legal entity responsible and liable for bitcoin, it isn't guaranteed to follow the precedent of zynga.
The need for zynga as the issuer seemed to rely on the fact that the currency was infinite in supply.  So I imagine the case would come down to arguing no need for an issuer because bitcoins are not infinite in supply.  However this isn't 100% accurate, since a majority of the network could decide to start double-spending coins to make more (not at all likely, but possible).
I think a lot of the outcome will depend on the mainstream political views of bitcoins.

I'm wondering if mtgox signed a special contract with Dwolla, more strict than the standard terms, forcing Dwolla to eat any losses from fraud.

The currency having a deflationary model is done as an incentive to hold bitcoins, but that is both savings and spending.
By the time all the bitcoins are mined, there will be enough merchants accepting bitcoin that you can buy at least half of the goods and services you need.  (If there aren't, bitcoin will likely be dead.)  Since you have to spend some money every month, would you rather hold your spending money in a currency that rises in value or one that falls?
If a lot of bitcoins are taken out of circulation because they are being horded, the value of those in circulation will rise accordingly.  And, as everyone else has mentioned, the bitcoins are infinitely divisible, all global commerce could be done with a single bitcoin.
@_date: 2011-07-25 19:11:57
You first need to prove to a court that bitcoins are property since there is no tangible good.
@_date: 2011-07-25 19:06:22
Sure, but when you go to court, what property will you claim is yours?  All you really have is a private key.  If someone hacks your computer for the private key, that would fall under Computer Fraud, accessing an unauthorized computer.  But if you can't prove the hacking, there's not much you can charge them with.
You could try to copyright your private key, and then if someone stole your bitcoins, you could sue them for IP infringement.
