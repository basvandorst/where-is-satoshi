I'm fine with the rich getting richer, but not if it prevents new people from getting rich. This is why Litecoin would be nice, ASICs are pretty much impossible.

Find me one website that has no affiliation with Bitcoin and accepts Dwolla.
Also, it's in the first paragraph of the Wikipedia page.

Let's just hope all this good news isn't voided with another blockchain fork to spread panic.
@_date: 2013-08-22 23:37:35
Why not UPS or FedEx? Seems kind of ironic to use Bitcoin to give the US Government money.
@_date: 2013-08-29 11:40:47
Should be really be encouraging larger and larger pools?
@_date: 2013-08-31 04:08:11
I think my dog and two cats have bigger problems than BTC if I die
@_date: 2013-08-31 14:16:12
Now you put that .003 that gave you to good use, buy a cruise ticket or something.
@_date: 2013-08-29 11:42:52
No... I'd say being uncareful is the best way to cause a 200BTC fee.
@_date: 2013-08-31 14:24:32
It did, in medieval times.
@_date: 2013-08-23 14:46:32
But let's be honest, a governmental attack is more likely than an ice storm the likes of which haven't been seen since 1997.
@_date: 2013-08-23 18:20:44


There's your problem.
@_date: 2013-08-31 23:43:49
Exactly. During the unintended fork, one single pool changed their version and fixed it. While this was convenient, the fact that the actions of one person can so drastically affect the network is _scary_.

I learned this when I sold my 75 Litecoins for $0.80 the day before they shot to $5
@_date: 2013-08-31 14:22:17
We can dream
@_date: 2013-08-23 15:15:49
Fair enough, but that doesn't change the fact that for every normal website you find, I can find 50 Bitcoin related sites with half the effort.
@_date: 2013-08-26 05:54:21
DON'T FUCK UP. I lost 2BTC doing this improperly.
@_date: 2013-08-23 03:56:15
They have the fucking audacity to _tell you_ that they're closing your account because they don't like the legal things you're doing with your money?

"Okay, before the burial, can I just go ahead and write down that number on his arm?"
@_date: 2013-09-01 06:23:52
But if I remember correctly he told them about it and returned their money.
@_date: 2013-08-24 03:14:32
Yeah. You can never be sure a bar of silver is real unless you pay more than it's worth to have it tested. With Bitcoin, there's plenty of ways to get scammed, but once you see your wallet balance go up, you're all set.
@_date: 2013-08-29 23:17:49


You're basically saying "there's 'downloading bitcoin and clicking send' easy, and then there's 'writing for Wired' easy". I'm sure Wired appreciates that.
@_date: 2013-08-31 22:21:40
__Bad__ idea.
@_date: 2013-08-30 20:34:55
no, to the ground to give everyone _one_ last chance to buy, then to Andromeda

If you deny that Dwolla exists primarily because of Bitcoin, you're delusional.
@_date: 2013-08-24 02:24:53
Sounds nice, but wouldn't they require existing infrastructure? If the government can get away with "disallow access to any non-.gov sites and all non-HTTP protocols", can't they just as easily say "disconnect all your clients from any network outside their house"?
@_date: 2013-08-23 14:31:27
I'm more concerned with a temporary lack of internet. Say the EU disabled internet access for it's citizens for a day. Except for the 10 of them that have Casacious coins or paper wallets with nice round amounts that they can trade, nobody there can trade bitcoin during that time. As soon as it goes back online, probably 50% of those users (maybe 30% of all users) immediately sell because they've lost faith in Bitcoin, and many miners probably sell their equipment.
And that, my friends, is how governments destroy something without touching it.
Irrelevant: We should see if [cyberbunker]( would be willing to host a bitcoin mining rig.

You want to talk about ridicule and failure? Using "noone" as if it's a word.
@_date: 2013-08-23 05:43:50
You'll notice it just links to "no one"
@_date: 2013-08-31 14:17:43
When he said "average" the first time, he meant "typical".
@_date: 2013-09-01 08:16:11
You can grow some common sense and start using Bitcoin-qt, bitcoind, or any other offline wallet.
@_date: 2013-08-29 23:15:13
I know, right? Like a few years ago when LA made murder illegal, that should have solved everything.
