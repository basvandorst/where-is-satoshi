Unfortunately for now we don't offer VPS hosting. If this Web hosting goes well we will expand our bussiness on VPS.

Well, sorry if that offends you. If I would randomly advertise I would use sponsored links, but for this occasion I wanted to put it as a normal link. Again, sorry if that is against some of your rules.

Yep, now I understand that. Since in 2 days of advertising I didn't get any customers. I am thinking about adding few services like VPS and seed boxes.  But I will still maintain Web hosting since I have few customers from past and I don't want to abandon them...

Yes, we are using latest version of WHMCS/cPanel for all our services.

I am not saying this as hosting owner, I am just telling you this as friend. If you don't believe me just go on forum like webhostingtalk and see what they wrote there.
Whenever you see unlimited disk space hosting just go away from it. They are lying before they even sell you something. And most of unlimited hosters have "fair use" policy where they limit your resources.

All that is great if somebody just want to make bunch of money. But I want to offer services that I have a lot of experience with. So I can help everyone that is using my services. So I think I will stick with Web Hosting,  VPS,  Game Servers, Seedbox and similar.
Anyway thanks for suggestions.

Yes, I saw that there is problem with pricing table on mobile version and I am working on it. I hope I will fix it soon but PC version is working fine you should check it if you have time.

First, almost all web hosting companies are the same on the surface they use same tool and same plans a lot of them even same price. But there are a lot of things behind that surface that is making them different.
You can all see what I have written on the website. SSD Disk, Weekly Backups, EU Servers. But there are a lot of things that you can't see like support quality, uptime. That is what makes all web hosters different. I am active on more than 10 subreddits trying to prove to you that we offer great support even before you buy our product.
And at the end, what do you think where should I advertise my host when I start accepting Bitcoin. I am advertising where I think people would be interested in it.
