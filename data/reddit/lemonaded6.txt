Well, if you say so, it must be true. Thank you for the heads up, kind stranger.

Where do people keep hearing this? Losses are absolutely counted.

I think he meant his fiat value went from 5k to 4k.

Ok, from what I understand, the wash sale rule is pretty unfair to day traders, but it is not as bad as you seem to think. If you make a loss and buy back into the same property within 30 days then it is considered a wash and you can't claim a loss on it. 
However, the amount you did lose would be added to your current buy in, so if you sold again without making a gain, you could still then count it as a loss. 
ex. Buy at $150, sell at $200 = $50 gain. This gain is taxable. Buy $150 again, sell at $50 = $100 loss. This loss would count against your gain unless you buy into it again within 30 days. If you do, its a wash and isn't counted, but it does get added to your new buy in value. Say you buy in again at $25, the 100 loss gets added to $25, so you are actually buying at $125 value. If you then sold your $25 (valued $125) at $50, its actually still a $75 loss, instead of a new $25 gain. As long as you don't buy in again within 30 days, then that loss would count. 
The only time wash sales can hurt you is when you buy and sell in December-January. If you have a loss in December but you buy back in January within 30 days, you can't use that loss for current tax year, and you could end up paying more in taxes if you have previous realized gains. However, a loss would be applicable for the next tax year if you sold again, assuming you avoid more wash sales. 
Like I said, it can be unfair to day traders because thats a lot to keep track of, and if you are trading the same property in December-January, and you have a large loss that is washed for that tax year, it can hurt pretty bad right then, but it'll still work out later on.
Keep in mind that I am not a professional, but this is my understanding at the moment.

After a quick search because I was curious as well, I think you can simply gift them their share of coins and the amount of time you owned them should carry over, as well as your buy in price.
