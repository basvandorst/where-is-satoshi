If bitcoin were to actually be the future it'd be more like the fall of humanity. The fact that we are wasting resources to generate artificially scarce text documents is bad enough - that we are actually attributing value to this garbage is beyond ridiculous. Primitive man would never have been this stupid.
First of all, if humanity was moving forward we wouldn't need a (supposedly) highly secured network of who owes who what... we would all just do things for each other. There's no reason our current fiat system wouldn't suffice as acceptable currency, the only reason it's failing is because of greed and abuse of power. Crypto is just the next step in that failure.
Secondly - bitcoins not decentralized, that's just the sales pitch. There's a few people at the top getting rich and fighting each other for control while chumps keep throwing money at them.
It's a pyramid scheme buddy, not salvation

Nah, you've got it all wrong. Primitive man woulda had his mind blown by all sorts of technology, but never this. You'd point to block chain and then he'd point to a fidget spinner and laugh at you.
Blockchain is not the thinking that tamed fire. Primitive man tamed fire to solve a problem. He continued to create to solve more problems... and in the end he solved so many problems he didn't know to do - so now he just creates them.
Now look at you - you're concerning yourself with someone else's technology solving really big (and utterly pointless) mathematically problems as if that's of value to anybody anywhere. I guarantee if I spent a week with you I could point out a dozen simple tasks you can't complete to an acceptable standard, a dozen basic skills your lacking, a dozen social problems you've no idea how to deal with, a dozen minor health issues you're ignoring and a dozen mental issues you think your hiding... most of which have been brought on through technology... and yet you don't even concern yourself with fixing these problems. Don't try and tell me a bunch of worthless text documents are a valuable part of our evolution when you can't get the basics right for yourself.
Anyways you seem balls deep in blockchain so I'll leave you to it

Lol when they decided to use our electronics and social media to spy and control us (for our own protection ��) there weren't any major riots... I'm pretty sure they can do what they want

Mate I honestly have no idea how this shit works but if I'm to take a guess someone in big finance is responsible for this years initial rise to $5k and now they are continuing to manipulate the market. I don't think China news or Dimon news or anything like it has anything to do with the dips, but they just use it to divert focus from the fact it's being manipulated. This is all just speculation on my part because bitcoin confuses the shit out of me

Bitcoin is still just fiat and credit cards... or are you using crypto for all your day to day transactions...?
@_date: 2017-09-27 15:27:46
Dude you should totally not do that. Save some money and invest but don't risk serious debt on a gamble!

But for btc to hit $100k wouldn't that mean people would have to pump $1-2 trillion dollars into it? That's 100 million people with a spare $10,000-20,000 you'll have to find... considering the struggle to hit $70 bln took 8 years it's hard to imagine it not crashing long before then...

What I find weird is why no one talked about what kicked this current good run off... like over a billion dollars got dumped into bitcoin in the space of two minutes rising it $200+ bucks instantly and no one said anything... and now it's been climbing ever since. Seems a bit dodgy to me after a fortnight of drops and a week of doing nothing

If bitcoin ever grew beyond control governments could just ban it and if you're found linked to it they could fine you/throw you in jail. Interest would die overnight if this happened in your region.
Anyways if you move large sums of money around it's going to have to return to fiat at some point and you'll have to pay tax soooo it changes nothing really

I reckon if and when they get around to creating a government backed crypto they'll approach companies like Microsoft, apple and google and use everyone in the world's hardware to mine crypto for them just like they already use it for data mining. Bitcoin won't be much of a big deal by then

I say we have to be better than we are, you say that I make you lose faith in humanity. Then you thank a text document generator for restoring your faith... that's ridiculous.
And how is it restoring your faith? You made a few thousand bucks off your initial investment? A few hundred? Is that how easy your faith is bought?
@_date: 2017-09-29 02:25:39
No you don't... but you do make 100% of your payments in fiat, give or take a little. You can't convince people the change to bitcoin is worth it if you can't even change your own habits
