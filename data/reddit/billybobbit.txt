Any system that is centralized is destined for failure. People do not want these mega corporations that are only interested in how to use and abuse the people to make themselves rich.

It is not available for firefox yet. 
Regarding your paranoia, I will conjecture that the folks at unsystem are pretty up to date on what is secure and what is not. Knowing that, I further assume that chromium is ok for darkwallet. Chromium (by the way) is the open-source version of chrome, and if you check out the sandbox and other technologies it has, it may even be more secure than firefox. 
Don't forget, theses guys have produced the ONLY wallet that will give true privacy and dignity back to the people. It is astounding how everyone else is terrified to demand their basic human dignity back.

This offers a tiny fraction of what Bitcoin offers while desperately trying to maintain control of the customers.

Part of it was a publicity stunt for Lawsky (which backfired cuz now he looks like an idiot) but the second and more important part was that the banks told him to "Move your ass" - so that's what he did.

Why is this on the front page?
It is **major** news for all of us here. You see Bitcoin is basically money with alot of extras. So we are very interested if the banks will be stealing our fiat money. Now if we have our money in Bitcoins, well, we won't be affected by the up-coming bank failures.

Yes, but its important to see the problems that come with such a proposal. Many times, the downside outweighs the upside. That being said, what op proposed is already being done with different forms of payment. In fact its been going on for thousands of years. Nothing new here.

I think the next step should be to work with private wallets. Centralized wallets are vulnerable and threaten your long-term viability. In other words, if they get blocked, or have some other problem, your service goes down the tubes. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 17:26:03
I don't want to nitpick as we agree that phones are not safe, but what did you expect Apple to say? Yeah we backdoor everything in exchange for various "favors" in our highly competitive market. 
The physical access you refer to was in 2008. That was 6 years ago! Further, since Apple jumped on board the PRISM program, is it so hard to imagine that they had backdoored everything maybe a year or 2 ago - or more? 
"0 day exploits" are not really 0-day anymore. As we found out, Microsoft held back patches after updating various agencies of 0days. I don't remember if we have written proof that Apple does the same and don't feel like searching now, but come on. I give it a 99% yes.
Anyway, we all know these big corps are the same same shit. Google is no better, and the broken rng in android was a glaring example ("Oh sorry your bitcoins got stolen, we made a mistake"). My first point is the one to pay attention to first. As is now, you can only begin to approach a secure phone if you build the os yourself.

Does it matter? Does a petty comparison to one of SO MANY drug markets have any relevance here. DarkMarket is genius. It gives us, the people, tools to function freely and with dignity. It represents so much more than a limited, very narrow reference to drugs. We do not have the freedom to use our money as we choose today.

I think most people would have no problem paying taxes if they were first of all a fair amount, and second, spent on things that benefitted society. Spending HUGE portions of tax money on wars to make your friends rich, and spying on your population will never be accepted. Further, stealing more money from your citizens by printing after you already took so much to spend on stuff nobody wants adds insult to injury. If the gross abuse of tax-money spending was corrected, the problem of collecting taxes would most probably vanish. Maybe in the future, the govt will crowdfund their projects...

Use your brain just a tad before getting all self-righteous. If routers are compromised by hacker gangs (backdoors can be used by others also by the way), then your BITCOINS are much easier to steal. If you are a hardcore tech guy, you can defend, but the majority will have a problem.

To compete with bitcoin fees, companies would have to function permanently in the red (given their current models of extortion). There is no company that can compete based on the dated traditional financial system. The only way is to integrate (as stated above) and look for profits elsewhere.

I said "over time". If you look back, all the big empires fell, ultimately, through greed and abuses of the ruled. You can argue the details, but it always boils down to wanting more, and abusing the people. As we move forward in time, things speed up. It will not take ~1500 years this time like for the Roman empire. Look at our tech advances in the last 100 years. It will probably happen in our lifetime.

Zynga may have brought some new interest to Bitcoin, but it has nothing to do with price increase. Bitcoin will always be going up because of what it is and what it offers the people of this planet.

Your question shows that you have very limited understanding of what Bitcoin is and what its potential is. I suggest you read up on what it is and what it does. Then, read up on the amount of venture capital that has been poured into it this year alone, and what those companies are working on. After that, check out all the open-source projects on github. Then you will be beginning to understand what you are talking about.
So, no, the shutdown of silkroad 2 will have no effect on the use and potential of Bitcoin. In fact, we're all curious how fast silkroad3 will take to be up and running - even though there are many many other clones of silkroad already.

Violation of privacy??
I think we should start with our governments when it comes to violations of privacy. They are far beyond this little prank.
Second step is for the corporations that were hosting those photos (did someone say apple?) to tighten up their program. You see, they are so concentrated on putting in back doors for spying, that these things are inevitable. If there are back doors, others will find them and use them. That is guaranteed.
Third step is to learn a lesson here: If you do not want sensitive information of yours published, learn how to keep it secure. If you do not know how to keep it secure, sit down and learn. If you are too lazy, don't take the damn photos.
I see no reason in blowing this trivial thing out of proportion. I'm sure there are plenty of high profilers out there with compromising photos/vids who have not been hacked. Maybe they are not lazy people....

They have a good track record and have been around a long time. Yes they could run off with your money, but then again, so can any exchange. I don't see mark karpeles getting punished.
The good thing is they don't bust your ass with all the bullshit paperwork the other exchanges ask for. It is the Americans who are pushing the whole "money laundering" myth, so they are probably out of reach of the Americans. However, they are obviously "in reach" of the Russians...

Yeah, ok. After everyone voiced their opinion already, Xapo comes out to join the herd months later. 
This post does not deal with the flagrant violations to freedom and privacy inherent in bitclicense but takes a very careful and almost ass-kissy stance. 
This post says, "Finally, the bitcoin industry has come to embrace and expend vast resources to comply with the existing Anti-Money Laundering and compliance frameworks applicable to banks and money transmitters.  The goal is to boost customer protection and confidence - and we as an industry have done so because our customers, not regulators, demand it."
Who are they trying to kid?
EDIT: Due to obvious misunderstanding (or xapo downvotes), I will clarify my last statement: What customers are demanding Anti Money Laundering and compliance frameworks?? I sure don't know of any.

Its actually a wake up call that there are still MANY people who think that banks are looking out for their customers. Here's some things to think about. Banks have been rigging libor as well as forex among other things. Banks play with their customers money like they were at a casino, lose it, then go crying to x central bank to get bailed out with tax money. Banks WAY overcharge in fees. Banks will callously bet against their clients if they can make money (JP morgan and subprime). Banks censor you by telling you what you can and cannot do with YOUR money...the list goes on and I'm tired.

Regulation is a knee-jerk, fear reaction by the banking industry which manifests in regulation created by their employees in various regulatory depts. This had to happen and is part of the natural evolution of our social systems. Old and no longer useful systems and beliefs rarely die off quietly, but the end result is always the same. No amount of kicking and screaming will change your expiration date...

There are many ways the banks could insert themselves into the Bitcoin economy.
Exchange service.
Secure storage.
Investment opportunities.
They will have to let go of the old paradigm of control and censorship to cover up massive fraud. This will be the hardest part for the banks. Those that can, will continue profitably. Those that don't, well, they will join the likes of the wagon companies that fought the automobile and blockbuster.
@_date: 2014-01-15 19:45:11
Guys, banks are not going away. They are made up of very smart and powerful people. They will be part of the future btc landscape and stand to profit well from it. They would do well as exchanges. It would be good for everyone. A Serious exchange is basically non-existent in the US. Maybe they've reserved that position for the banks...
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:51:08
If coinbase wants to do the right thing, why don't they publicly complain about the pressure they are receiving to spy on their users? Banks are getting dropped because they have become instruments of censorship and abuse. Coinbase is doing the same thing but in the name of bitcoin. It cannot end well...

Ok, I got the name wrong, its Courtyard of the Wise. I remembered something about "wise." Anyway, I read your long explanation above and see you have to conform to your local mafia bosses (regulators). I think its important to remember that the whole theme behind Bitcoin is to do away with the abuses on privacy conducted by the current banking system. It should be obvious to everyone that it is nobody's business what one does with his / her money. If you have been convicted of a crime, ok, then I can understand them checking your bank account. But not automatically spying on everyone with no conviction. That is insanity. Anyway, I understand its difficult for you as the machines are fixed, and centralized, and therefore vulnerable to violence and extortion. Keep your minds open for new possibilities guys...

I appreciate exchanges are pressured by various agencies, but exchanges are becoming MORE invasive than banks. It is easier to open a bank account than to get "verified" on an exchange. Unless you guys come up with some solutions, you will be out of business soon. The whole Bitcoin movement is squarely in opposition to these policies. Do not underestimate the imagination of the people to route around such obstructions.

He is right. The era of fiat is coming to a close. There is no more that can be done about it than could be done when the printing press was invented. Evolution waits for no one.

Yes, DarkWallet is setting a new standard. Although it is in another category (not third party storage), it will definitely raise the bar for all wallet services. The current condition of Blockchain is **not** acceptable for such a widely used service. Also, I never understood why they continue to use a **broken** mixer. Either use a real mixer or don't offer a mixing service at all. As is, they are **misleading** their customers.

I am interested in your services and will pay in Bitcoin. However, I have 2 questions:
1. You mention Skype alot on your site. Is that your VOIP offering? Skype is confirmed spyware and is not interesting to any individual or business with the slightest concern for security or privacy.
2. Your business is located in the US. What backdoor policy are you required to uphold as a business based in the US. What steps have you taken to protect your client's privacy? Cloud services based in the US are generally not trusted outside of the US. 
People on this forum tend to be more technically advanced and interested in companies that actively promote security and defend privacy (just sayin...).

Yes. Its ridiculous. They cannot ban software. Once it's open-sourced, it can never be shut down. Imagine trying to pick up hundreds of people scattered around the world who contribute to the code. Oh, and those people **know** how to use cryptography to cover their tracks. Further, I imagine even the average sheeple will not like the idea that the govt **demands** to listen in on **all** human interactions. Maybe that's what it will take to wake up all the dummies who vote for these people.

Yep. Wooops, not such a great "invention" by facebook after all. And basing it on the crumbling foundation of credit cards is just about as smart as ApplePay. When control is your motivator, innovation suffers...heavily.
@_date: 2015-03-14 06:30:01


What?? Fail!!
@_date: 2015-03-14 11:55:35
Because the first server you connect to knows all your future addresses plus your real ip. Changes after that do not take back that info. 
@_date: 2015-03-15 07:15:50
Rather than being a surly little fuck, why don't you **add** what I missed. Why don't you help rather than be miserable. Trust me, you will feel better.
@_date: 2015-03-18 08:56:39
When you spend from your address, the value you sent goes to one address and the change goes to another - your address. There is a link here. If at some point you make an identifiable transaction, a transaction on an exchange, an airplane ticket, or anything else that can tie to you, someone can trace back alot of information about you on the blockchain. Also, if you did not have enough in one address to make a purchase, your wallet will pull from another one of your addresses (or change addresses). Now these addresses are linked, also to the new change address. If you are not *extremely* careful (to the point of Bitcoin becoming unusable), you will leave a trail...forever.

This is good advice. The only wallet that actually gives you the *pseudoanonymity* that everyone is talking about for Bitcoin is Bitcoin core with Tor. All other wallets go from bad to worse regarding privacy although their security can be good.
@_date: 2015-03-16 07:03:52
Yes, it is only effective for casual use. But it is during casual use that most mistakes are made, so its a good thing.
@_date: 2015-03-15 07:12:47
@_date: 2015-03-14 11:45:20
There is no claim that Tor stops govt surveillance. It is a first step for increasing your privacy from zero.
@_date: 2015-03-13 20:12:48
Its very simply done in the settings of either client. You have to be careful with electrum, however, it sneakily rushes to connect before you have time to change the settings. It also doesn't allow you to change the network settings until you actually connect. So, you have to force it through tor at connection and then change the settings. Sneaky sneaky and I don't like it - and I'm not even starting on SPV that it uses also. Bitcoin-qt, on the other hand seems benign and is easy to route through tor. It may be a bit of a hassle, but its waaay better to run a full node than a thin client.

Looks very cool! I have been waiting for something like this.
Please explain where the coins I am buying come from. Do you hold a pot of each currency? Are your limits based on the sizes of the pots?

its a **beginners guide**. A starting point. There is no claim that this solves all privacy concerns.

Whoever didn't know that blockchain.info is spyware is not well informed.

As I said above, I "eagerly await the new implementations."
@_date: 2015-03-14 09:14:58
yes. Goto settings and follow instructions above.
@_date: 2015-03-14 09:20:39
This does not work. In offline mode when I hit "network" it says "you are using electrum in offline mode. Restart electrum if you want to get connected." 
That looks really bad. Why is it so difficult to change network settings before initial connect??
@_date: 2015-03-16 07:09:45
TextSecure is the best msg app out there from a security point of view. However, its one significant drawback is that it forces you to use your phone number, so all your textsecure contacts end up in your regular contacts. Besides this reducing deniability, you are also required to use Google services for push. Almost everything Google is rushing and pushing to upload your contacts (along with all other identifying info). I wonder why...?
I understand that Moxie made this for the masses, and has it in the program to change, but right now its a problem. You also can't use it on tablets.
Having said that, I think Moxie is the man for this type of thing and eagerly await the new implementations. 
@_date: 2015-03-14 09:14:12
Yes, thanks, I forgot to add the settings change for proxychains. Another method is to goto Network settings &gt; proxy settings &gt; manual &gt; and fill in the "Socks host." That's how it is on my system so it will be a variation of this on other systems. This is a **basic** (not foolproof) way of routing through Tor Browser.
Oh, and nice pics :)
@_date: 2015-03-18 09:02:41
Good point, but lists have not been established - yet. Chainalysis are trying right now. If there were established white and black lists, all the coins stolen on Gox would be blacklisted and become worthless (or reduced value) over night. But what happens when you get blacklisted for your political views, or the coins you received for selling your used computer on ebay came 5 times removed from some "crime" and are all of sudden worth less? It gets complicated.
@_date: 2015-03-14 09:41:31
If all your internet traffic is routed through your VPN, then you should be fine, except for in extreme cases.
@_date: 2015-03-14 09:25:56
Also a step in the right direction but your ISP know which VPN you are using. In an extreme case, your VPN could get attacked or coerced. VPN and Tor, and we're getting better.
@_date: 2015-02-25 06:05:25
Yeah, and then use thin wallets where the servers you depend on link all your addresses and then attach them to your IP. Bitcoin is not private guys. If we're not careful we'll end up in a system much worse than the present one.
@_date: 2015-02-19 07:08:51
Funny enough, you have come up with the solution! All this revolutionary stuff would not come into being if our governments did not try to oppress and exploit us.
@_date: 2015-02-24 07:14:04
I thought Fidor was partnered with Kraken....
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:17:19
Don't forget that all SPV servers (Electrum servers are SPV) **can** log your addresses. All transactions, therefore, done on an Electrum wallet can be traced back to you. If you don't use tor (even one time), your IP is tagged onto your address list. This just makes it easier to identify you.
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:01:29
That's a good solution, but how does that help the masses who think they are transacting privately?
@_date: 2015-02-01 07:53:59
This should be required viewing in all high schools of America and Europe.
@_date: 2015-02-22 15:59:36
If I don't like it and want to use another one, what would you suggest?
@_date: 2015-02-18 07:13:10
And my point was not dismissing your point, but adding to it. I say that yes, its not coinbase's fault, but the government's fault. We need to support solutions that challenge this abusive stance of the govt. In fact, this abusive stance of the govt adds unnecessary costs to all financial companies in trying to turn them into policemen.
@_date: 2015-03-14 09:20:39
Its a start, and the more people that use Tor the less it "marks" you.
@_date: 2015-02-18 06:39:24
KYC/AML are the tools of the government to big brother and control everyone. We need to support technologies that make these tools useless. The founding fathers of America are rolling in their graves watching their descendants decimate the freedoms they laid their lives on the line for!
@_date: 2015-02-23 06:20:46
If the exchange scene was not so ridiculous in its requirements, this would not be an issue. If banks were not such nosy thieves, this also would not happen. These are the growing pains of extracting ourselves from an abusive system.

The American tech market has lost a lot of business because of this obsessive spying and it will lose a lot more. Does anyone know how we can defend against a company that we trusted sending us malware as Odom describes?

Exactly, who paid him to write an article promoting the safety and stability of the current banking system? The current banking house of cards has already started to collapse. It is getting propped up by various bail-outs and printing programs, but essentially is on its way out.


Are you sure?


This just tries to scare people away from **taking responsibility for their own lives.** Sheep are much easier to control.
@_date: 2015-03-11 06:21:17
Financial laws are neither fair nor logical. They are created to support monopolies and corruption. All this crypto stuff was created to challenge this unfair and exploitative environment. The crazy thing is that there are many people like you who are afraid to imagine doing what they want with their **own** money, let alone **demanding** their right to think for themselves. 
@_date: 2015-02-23 05:59:29
Almost all "secure" connections are made over https. So this is NOT good at all for Bitcoin users. SSL was compromised long ago by the NSA. Those continuing to rely on it for important stuff will be crying one day. Vulnerabilities created by the NSA are exploited by hacker gangs more and more. The hard part of their work is already done for them.
@_date: 2015-02-17 16:41:03
If this works as claimed, its definitely a good thing.
@_date: 2015-02-25 06:13:51
No, but all the sites that you will use bitcoin with do use https. 
@_date: 2015-02-27 06:18:06
Besides this idiot, Bitcoin is **far** from anonymous, and thin wallets make it downright public. Don't fool yourselves. If privacy is not increased, there will be a lot of problems with thefts, hacking, etc.
@_date: 2015-02-18 07:05:43
This wise piece of art displays the adaptive mechanism of nature. With such a root system, the plant will easily route new leaves and growth around the finger that attempts to control it. The finger will then have to move to "squash" the new growth. When it does, 10 more growths will sprout out in other locations, nourished by the huge root system. This then becomes a lost game for the thumb playing whack a mole.

Right now, the cards are stacked heavily against whistle blowers. They are persecuted by the state and end up either in prison or hiding for the rest of their lives. Now imagine if they could get their information out there anonymously. Imagine if they even had a monetary motivation for getting the information out there. I believe this would reduce government corruption, dishonesty, and theft greatly. As is, governments are waaaay out of control. Of course, all things can be used for evil also. 
Don't forget that criminals are breathing the same air that you breathe. Ban oxygen! Oh wait...
@_date: 2015-02-24 06:39:18
Great. I **really** hope you have implemented some privacy feature(s). As is, it provides zero privacy, and a little privacy if you use Tor. As more and more crimes are committed by tracking people, wallets that do not offer privacy are ultimately hurting Bitcoin, as users will get scared away by the fact that it is so easy for **anyone** to follow their financial activity and status.
@_date: 2015-02-19 07:24:52

For non-techies, install tor browser bundle and set the wallets to 127.0.0.1 and 9150 and socks5. Then run the browser bundle before starting the wallet.

Thank you for your great work. When will we see something that gives us some privacy in our transactions like coinjoin or similar?
@_date: 2015-02-13 06:31:43
This is a very important truth you discovered, but too deep for most people to confront. This is how evolution works. It is a gradual and never ending process, constantly moving towards improvement. It is fascinating to watch as the old and dying (systems / institutions/ ideas) struggle to stay relevant. Its not only about Bitcoin, but the philosophy behind it. Life waits for no one. You're either growing or decaying.

I disagree. This makes us think about the anonymity issue for bitcoins. A simple solution would not have received the same attention. Many (actually most) times, people need a slap in the face to wake up. The ignorant must learn to appreciate privacy if there is to be any hope in the future. Otherwise we find ourselves in a long line of sheep on the way to the slaughterhouse.
@_date: 2013-11-16 13:33:12
hahaha. God and Israel are large parts of the massive problems america finds itself in today. I am tempted to rant here but will try to stick to the subject. I was referring to the constitution, democracy, respect for the citizens, (somewhat) free markets - the land of opportunity. America is quickly becoming a giant prison with big brother breathing down your neck at every turn.
@_date: 2013-12-11 16:23:01
I have a friend who's bitcoins were lost and then refunded by btc-e about a year ago, and believe they are solid. It will be hard to grow further and handle really large amounts of money being anonymous though. I believe they should look into setting up a serious company with offices and so forth. This will do wonders for new people trusting them.

Although they may have their own problems in Russia, they are correct about the dollar. I think the whole world now understands that the dollar is doomed.

Banks are the most powerful entities today. To think they will disappear is delusional. They will re-position themselves. That they show serious interest in Bitcoin means Bitcoin is solid. What their plans and agendas are is inconsequential. The smart people will come out on top and the dumb ones on the bottom. This has been the same since we discovered caves. 
Bitcoin gives everyone a chance to re-position him/herself. It will not change human nature.

I don't think he means btc was made to avoid taxes (although it does bring to light the illegitimacy of the present taxation system). I think he meant that btc does not need any govt to impose taxes on it in order for it to gain legitimacy. The inverse is actually true. Govts will gain legitimacy when people decide to contribute taxes voluntarily to their programs.

1. Thefts have been going on since the beginning of time. I am referring to the protocol. It is solid to date.
2. If you think it is ok for regulators to be up your ass spying on every movement you make with your money, and on top of that dictating where and how you are permitted to spend it, then i don't understand why you'd be interested in bitcoin, or in this forum, in the first place.
3. "Clumsy for transfers"? I disagree. It would be redundant to explain here how bitcoin transfers work.
4. Ok, here you sound like you work for CNN or something. The govt lowering the value of the people's savings because they need to finance some wars or something is not OK. They take MORE than enough in taxes. If they want more, they should say so. Printing money is a sneaky way of duping the ignorant.
5. What government? Do you think the US govt can ban exchanges in China or Russia or India? Exchanges simply move to more friendly environments.

Sorry if not clear. I will clarify. "Foundation" was meant generally to imply many things including only one solution which is bitcoind. I didn't mean to imply the foundation owns bicoind or j (although they do have a significant say in its development). I wanted to imply that several platforms to choose from will enrich the environment and bring out the best in each team working on each platform. This environment benefits all.

Exactly! As the value of btc increases more and more merchants will want it.

Hi jim618. thanks for your reply and sorry if i offended you. After donating what has turned into a considerably large amount to the Bitcoin Foundation, and knowing that the guys there like Gavin are rich men now, I was surprised that something so fundamental as proxy capability was missing from the default wallet. I am also concerned by the many comments Mike Hearn has been making about "criminals." He seems to be trying to balance privacy with foiling "criminals." Common sense tells us that is an impossible feat. And that feat comes after the impossible hurdle of defining a "criminal". Against this backdrop, I imagine you can see how I would be upset at a reduction in privacy in the client. Thanks for your hard work, and maybe we should have the option to donate directly to the coders rather than to the bitcoin foundation.

You seem to miss the point. I am not trying to hide. I simply would like a more secure environment when entering bitcoin info. Using tor, Gyft, right now, is unusable. It continues to be unusable even after allowing scripting. That, in and of itself, is an indicator. I find it curious you don't know what HTTPS is although you're a web developer.

I propose a character validation system here on Reddi. We can call it CVS:
Alex Waters: Sellout == True, Trust == None, Scammer == True
Matt Mellon: Due to being born into a banking family, Trust == None, ass-kissing to the system == FULL FORCE to keep the cushy lifestyle.
Yifu Guo: Thief == True, Sellout == True, Scammer == True
I propose all coins that ever touch these guys to be rejected out of hand by the community. How's that for validation BITCHES?!

Bitcoin is interesting in that it actually gives everyone economic incentive to do it right. Any attempts at centralization or censorship will automatically reduce its value. It is valuable BECAUSE it is private and decentralized. So in this case, we have to work hard at KEEPING it private and decentralized in order to INCREASE the value of our holdings.

I know America is a big player in global economics, but it is by no means the only player. US regulation is NOT a do or die for bitcoin. If the US over-regulates, businesses will move elsewhere and America will lose tax revenue - and that is a priority for them.

Now THAT is a good observation. Why would that money move to Bitcoin? Well, I would say the law of human nature would describe that. 
Here's your choice:
1. Leave your money in the bank where each month it will lose some of its value.
2. Invest your money in bitcoin and the value of your money will increase.

Who gives a shit about dropbox??
Guys, dropbox was mentioned in the Prism docs as coming on board soon. They are glamorized spyware. This was pointed out a couple of months ago in this sub. Even if that were not the case, only people with the lowest tech understanding would use an inferior service like that! 
Minimum requirement for cloud service is absolutely no way they could ever view your data. I can only think of 2 such services that offer that now. At least one accepts btc.

LeoPanthera, I'm sorry but the link you posted is Dropbox's weak and ridiculous response to the Snowden revelations. Dropbox was specifically mentioned in the Prism portfolio as "coming on board soon." After that was revealed, they and the other traitorous companies that were named all rushed to do some pr for damage control. In the future, do your homework bud - or do you have some agenda here?
@_date: 2013-12-05 09:38:38
I disagree. Banks can fight but they cannot win. They are not dumb and they know this. They can continue to make a lot of money by embracing bitcoin. Banks can all become exchanges as a first step. They would get a huge amount of business only from that. They could offer escrow services, they can still give out loans. With a little imagination, there are MANY ways for them to make money.

@_date: 2013-11-20 11:11:15
I disagree. OP is correct: BTC cannot be regulated. If they regulate US businesses (as they can ONLY regulate US businesses), they will cripple their economy as business shifts overseas. Cant order from an American business (or don't want to), no prob, I'll order from China or Brazil or wherever. Can't set up a globally competitive business in the US? No prob, off to Hong Kong or Switzerland, etc I go.

I think the Chinese govt's move was well thought out. What happened was a bunch of  idiots misunderstood what it meant and panicked. Then we got a bunch of mis-informed articles which led to a dip in the market. The idiots on the Western side panicked without even knowing why they were panicking. 
It didn't last long, and China has not lost much. They learned today that bitcoiners tend to be hysterical.

My favorite analogy I read was somewhere here on reddit, but i can't remember where to give due credit: x(100) years ago, specialists predicted that horseshit would be 3 floors deep in most major cities so projects were started to deal with the situation. No one could imagine what the real solution would be - except a few such as Henry Ford and Benz. This solution developed into another problem whose solution we have yet to see...

Mike Hearn is a human. Even if his intentions are 'good' it is not his place to make legal or not legal decisions, or to facilitate that decision making process for others. Mike has not fully understood what he is saying (nor his position in the bigger picture), and as a result has already affected the market. Does he not understand that a move like that will destroy bitcoin over night? People will simply switch to another altcoin. Until everything is properly decentralized, nobody is going to put too much money into this thing. And yes, this bitcoin foundation thing needs ALOT more transparency.

I don't think there are any "presumptions" here. Mike Hearn expressed a very specific desire for something he dubbed "redlisting." He also expressed his desire to combat "criminals." Combating "criminals" is not his job. His job is to protect a NEUTRAL protocol, not to become a tool of the feds (consciously or unconsciously). He has condemned himself. If wants to be James Bond, he should change job!

A bubble does not re-inflate after a couple of days. A bubble is based on false information, and when that is discovered, then bubble bursts. It does not re-inflate. Bitcoin is going steadily up. It has nothing to do with a bubble. The wild swings are due to a few speculators with deep pockets and ALOT of amateurs trying to make a quick buck.
You could call Bitcoin a bubble if a security flaw was discovered and everyone abandoned it. Then the bubble would be burst and that would be the end of the story. A new protocol would be a new story.

I really think so much weight on govt's stance is unwarranted. This is something that cannot be stopped. Their somewhat positive stance is based on this fact. There is absolutely no other reason for them to accept a reduction in control. Regulation may delay growth, but by no means can it stop it. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 12:25:59
Govts have control now because people still want their fiat paper. Control is already in the people's hand but they don't exercise it.
