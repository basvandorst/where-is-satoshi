Technically they *are* all small bubbles. They, pop, the price corrects, and we return to normal growth until it happens again.

Aaaand it's gone.

It's  *achomlishmed.* Because he has the biggest brain with the best words...

Yeah, why would you vote for an out of touch pervert when you can vote for an incumbent rapist, racist, instead?   �� �� ��
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:15:47
That is the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:13:18
Right? My butthole is going to be puckered at least until Christmas.
@_date: 2019-08-28 21:59:31
Yep, I've heard that before, like 10000 times over the last 10 years.

He bought in at 19k and says he it was the biggest money mistake of his life, which he will never repeat... but also says that his predictions are never wrong. And he also frequents T\_D. Yeah, I don't think your gonna be owing that guy a coke... or anything for that matter, even if his broken clock is right once or twice.
He also recommends to not trust anybody's advice, and instead buy and sell based on your gut feelings. I know that trading based on my emotions is absolutely the best thing to do! You can't lose with that strategy!

That's how you get some murders on your hands :P

Put it in gold?

I’m pretty sure I have a least a trillion grains of sand in my yard

That is terrible advice for anybody.

Any (R) president would have signed the tax cut into law. That was Paul Ryan's baby, not Trump's. He literally did nothing, except sign it.  In fact, Trump hasn't done much at all, other than golf and rage tweet... because he is a fucking hack.
And no, the stock market has not been rising. While seeing some steep rises and drops, on average it has been fairly stagnant for like a year and a half. Trickle down corporate welfare tax cuts don't work. They never have and never will. We have seen this before. The rich choose to pocket the extra money, not pass it down to the labor force.
Trump is a grifter. A successful one, I'll give him that, but he's a grifter through and through.

You don’t need any news source to look at a graph of the stock market and see it improving steadily over roughly the last decade, until the recent instability.
@_date: 2019-06-21 13:41:09
And now it’s flat and unstable... it’s almost like the temporary gains were just due to a massive tax cut for corporations...

There is no record of his billions, since he won't release his tax returns. He's a charlatan, and an idiot.
@_date: 2018-02-12 04:49:03
Did I say everybody's tax returns should be public? No. I said his should, because he's a public servant who has the most power in the land, should be held to a higher standard, and should allow the people to make sure he is working for them and doesn't have conflicts of interest. He should be held accountable to the people, as should anybody else in his position.
Just because he has worked on multiple projects doesn't mean he is successful, or billionaire. Virtually every business he has run fails, while he bankrupts it and everybody else involved loses a shit ton of money. That's why US banks won't lend to him anymore. He is a conman who stiffs contractors, invents a fake ass school and pays out 25 mil once he is sued for it, trump steaks, trump casinos, etc... His entire act is a sham. He knows business about as well as he knows politics, governing or leadership... which is laughable at best. The only thing he knows how to do well is con dumb ass motherfuckers into joining his failed business ventures or his failed presidency.

Then 8500, then 7000, then 10k, then 15k, then 5k, then 20k... :)
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:57:35
He is way worse.

Everything?
