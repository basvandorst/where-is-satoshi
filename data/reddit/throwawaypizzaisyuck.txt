It's been very easy to do on bcash basixally ever since it forked. One of many reason the coins is unsafe for holding wealth

The economy of value should start first with safe storage and then move on to safe exchange. Bitcoin is doing just that. Being able to exchange doesn't matter if your value is seized or inorganically devalued and Bitcoin as a community understands this. The ability to exchange is really important and Bitcoin has a challenge ahead in this regard, but it shouldn't be the most fundamental priority because it's useless without the foundation of storage.

Or even just that it makes sense why everyone keeps calling it a bubble

They know if they don't rely on the bitcoin name and leave it up to organic growth they'll wither away

Looks great. I would like to buy or make one. Would you share the design or sell for a reasonable price?

This is a big challenge for crypto to overcome, and the early treatment is appears to be smart contracts

Id love to spin up my own LND node on Ubunutu, anyone have ELI5 instructions for that?
@_date: 2017-09-20 01:52:35
You called it. I did what you suggested and it was in fact updated every time I opened it. I guess I just had to let it appear to hang for a long long time. Now it's back to syncing and almost done. 
Add 1 more full node to the network. Thanks for everyones help!

I don't seem to be able to load the app far enough to get to the logs. It's hanging during the loading page.

You think so? I left it for 10 hours today and it still said 0%. I suppose I could leave it longer

I’ve only recently looked into the number of nodes facilitating bitcoin and was shocked to learn how few there were. Lots of the best onboarding literature and videos for newcomers relies on the security and reliability of a globally distributed network and the inability to hack all ledgers simultaneously. Under 10,000 reachable nodes doesn’t seem an insurmountable challenge in this day and age, but maybe I’m missing something. If I’m not, then it doesn’t instill the confidence in the system that it needs.
I want to run a full node but don’t currently have a secondary computer to run 24/7. I will probably end up buying a second cheap computer to operate as a full node just so I can contribute to the health and security of bitcoin, but I’m sure there are plenty of people in my shoes who want to run a node but without the ability to take on extra expense to do so.
The process to set up a secure wallet for normies is difficult enough and the ask to set up a full node is not unsubstantial itself, contributing to low adoption IMO: 
My questions to the community are:
•	While I understand the more nodes the better, at what # of sufficiently distributed nodes is the ledger “secure”?
•	Are there any community outreach initiatives around getting bitcoin nodes set up? Should there be?

I'm Canadian and I've travelled to the UK a few times in the past few years. I just recently returned from a trip over there and brought a few pounds in bills back to the UK with me that I received on my last trip probably 8 months ago.
When trying to pay for things across the pond, I received absolutely horrified looks from merchants when I slapped this bad boy down on the table. Apparently UK merchants don't accept legal tender its government issued, and they were well within their right to tell me to find some other sucker to unload my "old" money on.
In all fairness, I was eventually able to find someone nice enough to accept the bills and was advised that banks may still convert it to new bills for me. Also, this may be a UK-specific policy and perhaps other governments stand by older currency, but needless to say issuing money that "expires" is bullshit.
When given those shocked and pitiful looks while trying to spend this, the first thing I thought was score 1 more for bitcoin.

Not sure what you mean. I let my app download and sync all the blocks for days
