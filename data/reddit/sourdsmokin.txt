How about legitimacy, a stamp of approval, and a vote of confidence for corporate entities to utilize Bitcoin without fear of impending crackdown? Just those kind of things.
@_date: 2014-07-19 04:56:15
As much as I hate to say it, Bitcoin has really stagnated in consumer adoption. The majority of people don't necessarily want nor care about the idea of decentralized currencies. They care more about security than freedom when it comes to their money, and most fiat (the USD) is doing just fine.

I know on bitfloor you can place a limit order, so that when you think the price is going up or down, you can automatically ride the wave once your specified price point has been reached.

I'm glad you held firm in your conviction in the face of ignorance. People often hate things they don't understand, and it's not always easy to bring them into the light. They will learn, though, just as people had to learn about "magic money" credit cards back in the day.

Hate to break it to you, but the Silk Road is back. The Winklevii are pushing through their ETF and the upcoming Senate hearing(s) could establish some bonafide validity to this magic money we've been toying with. Big players are then soon to follow (i.e. Amazon, eBay, blah blah blah) 
@_date: 2013-11-08 06:13:42
The hashing power isn't great enough to make any return with the difficulty as it is, due to manufacturers pumping out ASIC chips designed specifically for mining bitcoin. Scrypt coins (i.e. litecoin, etc.) use a different protocol, useless for ASIC miners. GPU mining is still (somewhat) productive for those coins. At this point, as others have stated, you're really just better off piecing out the cards on ebay/craigslist and buying BTC straight up.

Barring a plea deal, this seizure could take several months to liquidate to USD, as I'm sure they won't touch it while a trial is ongoing.

The thing is, Western Union's infrastructure is everywhere. In every little third world hovel on the planet, chances are you will find a shop that transacts Western Union money. The internet is far less prevalent worldwide. Google and other companies are trying to fix that, but when all you need is a telephone and a pin number to pick up the money your benefactor sent home, it's hard to compete. Long term, that is sure to change.

I wholeheartedly agree. I think the stickied FAQ has helped cut down some of the noob posts, but this subreddit has been growing evermore toxic against really attracting the people who we need on our side the most.

I think the max is somewhere in the $100,000 to $1 million range. With inflation and time, though, that could be even higher. That would give it a $21 trillion market cap. If we're talking New World Order currency levels, replacing money as we know it, the moon is the limit.

I wouldn't put more than half into BTC, especially if you aren't up to speed on how to store it securely. Hackers can grab it in an instant if you aren't careful. That said, most Americans use coinbase.com to buy their bitcoins. Just be sure to enable 2 factor authentication in the settings when you create an account. Your coins will be pretty safe there, but if you want 100% security, look into creating a paper wallet on bitaddress.org.

Make sure you set up 2 factor authorization on blockchain.info. For paper wallets, most people use bitaddress.org. Save the web page to your computer, generate the address, then send the coin from your online wallet to the "load and verify" public key.

There will always be fluctuations, but it will reach a point of relative stability. If a BTC is worth $1 million USD in the future, a 10 or 20 thousand dollar drop is only a 1-2% change in it's relative value.

God these memes suck.
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:19:20
Yes, always. Sell only to those with lots of positive feedback if you're worried.
@_date: 2013-11-14 07:38:12
Oh, you're right. I guess I really meant to say an S-curve, combining the best of both worlds.
@_date: 2013-11-18 18:31:19
Jesus, you're only the 23rd person to post this today.

Source? What is the impetus for a large rally next week?
@_date: 2013-11-09 04:51:55
$500 by next Wednesday.
@_date: 2013-11-03 21:29:51
No it doesn't.
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:24:10
Dude is smart as fuck.
@_date: 2013-11-12 00:53:29
Localbitcoins maybe? Maybe?
@_date: 2013-11-14 04:29:47
Growth in technologies tends to follow a logarithmic, rather than a linear curve. BTC could be gaining thousands of dollars in value per day sometime in the (relatively near) future.
@_date: 2013-11-27 20:24:23
No. People who own a total of 51% are not willing to part with them.
@_date: 2013-11-15 07:10:33
I will travel to your area and leave this minute at $20000 per coin.
@_date: 2013-12-25 20:00:17
Dem white fudge Oreos.... MMMMmmmm.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:51:58
Is that like writing a bad check?
@_date: 2013-11-16 21:33:39
Who here is going to Subway tonight?
@_date: 2013-11-20 17:47:11
Not really. People just don't understand that with Bitpay/Coinbase, you can have the USD equivalent deposited directly into your business account.
@_date: 2013-11-18 17:22:35
Haha this is awesome.
@_date: 2013-10-27 05:43:24
Holy shit. Trey Parker, is that you?

If no one else has access to the phone, then it shouldn't be a problem.
@_date: 2013-11-13 04:13:14
Winklevii here. We're transferring 3000 BTC to your address for the kind words. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 07:27:05
The bigger problem is that not enough people have even heard of Bitcoin. If and when awareness reaches critical mass and utility expands to universal levels, $100k coins are definitely not out of the question. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 03:35:16
Ouch, dude. That sucks.
@_date: 2013-11-09 18:53:51
No one knows. You'll be kicking yourself if you never buy in, though.
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:45:53
Cold wallet/paper wallet is the ultimate safehouse. It's the Fort Knox of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:33:11
No decisions were made. That's why they call it a hearing.
@_date: 2013-11-05 02:54:57
Still lots of gullible people on eBay.
@_date: 2013-11-13 15:57:24
You did not just ask who that is. I know you didn't!

@_date: 2013-12-08 08:20:07
Quite. I'll just leave this here.

Do it now, price is going to be up $50 buy noon.

Western Union/Paypal/Banks all have positives to gain by incorporating Bitcoin, no matter the price. It's not simply an "us vs them" game. Bitcoin is good for all.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:55:36
FIVE. FIVE DOLLAR. FIVE DOLLAR FOOTLAUONG! any any any

In 10 years: "wow! I wish I had a whole bitcoin! You rich bastard!"
@_date: 2013-11-21 19:30:36
Brilliant post, even if it's just a rumor. People in this community will be mad at Starbucks if they don't actually follow through.
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:00:01
Seriously. I have never fucking heard of Ripple before today.

I want 1 quark in gold, please.

It's still extremely rare. Most people won't even hear about it after the senate hearing, as it's on C-SPAN 3. We're still an exclusive club.

What boggles my mind is how people in third world countries always seem to have a smile on their face.
@_date: 2013-11-04 03:33:51
I sold it under the CPU/processor category on eBay. Fiat is paper money (i.e. Dollars, Euros, Pounds).  
@_date: 2013-11-20 03:39:18
It could go higher in the short-term, yes. But not a whole lot of new infrastructure has been created to support the price as it is today. It's been mostly speculative, with few new merchants accepting it or big time hedge funds and ETFs swooping in.
@_date: 2013-11-07 21:03:04
Bitcoin is indeed superior as far as remittances go. Western Union will have to adapt and become it's own escrow/exchange to compete and still justify the transaction fees.
@_date: 2013-11-05 23:29:27
How does one operate a "vegan" deli?
@_date: 2013-11-18 07:52:48
About 3-5 business days.

Is it possible for Americans to open a European bank account for faster deposits from Gox? Possible arbitrage opportunity.
@_date: 2013-11-03 22:46:06
PM me if you would like to buy a PS4 or Xbox One with BTC directly from me. We can even do escrow if you want.

Pretty sure that's how it works. 
@_date: 2013-11-17 05:03:20
Less than 0.0001%. There are maybe 200,000 people in the world who own any denomination of BTC, though there's really no way to tell.

My Uncle saw the man on the grassy knoll.
@_date: 2013-11-09 14:31:00
Thank you, super cool Asian man! We're all going to be rich very soon, and owning an entire bitcoin will be a status symbol of wealth.
@_date: 2013-11-13 09:26:22
You should just wear a Bitcoin shirt everywhere you go.
@_date: 2013-12-04 05:45:48
That's cool as hell. I'm still waiting for my Iraqi Dinars to revaluate, but I'm thinking Bitcoin has a much better chance.
@_date: 2013-12-01 01:11:00
Gotta buy 'em all, gotta buy 'em all.
@_date: 2013-11-14 17:39:35
Probably the same as if you buy through localbitcoins.
@_date: 2013-11-16 07:57:37
Fiat, by definition, is issued by a government.
@_date: 2013-10-27 05:50:43
$12-$80 million? That's the most optimistic projection I've heard yet.
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:19:40
Me too. Sideways trading is really boring to watch. I guess a boring Bitcoin is a better Bitcoin?
