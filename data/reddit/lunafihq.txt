Great resource! A few suggestions: 
You may want to add more to wallets (hot wallets, cold, etc) or define them as paper wallets, etc. 
You might want to mention they aren't actually stored in the wallet but the network keeps track of balances. 
You might want to include seed, private key, public key. 
There are also newer terms like initial bug offering and initial mining offering as alternatives to ICO.

Got to love the dedication. I wish I could say I was doing something better.

Good luck and keep us posted! We are cheering you on!

$10k by the end of the year. Don't worry :)

We can agree that it shouldn't be that expensive (have you seen Western Union fees??), but we have to agree it wasn't Satoshi's original intent to make it a "cheap" decentralized cash system. There is more than 1 team trying to make it cheaper. Someone will be successful if we are patient.

Bitcoin wasn't designed to provide "free" crypto. It was designed to be a decentralized peer to peer cash system. Everyone that says we should rush this sounds like a project manager rushing software engineers to deliver on imaginary deadlines. People are working hard to build a system the right way and the added pressure won't help. It will all come together and there will be innovative technogies that come out of it. Fees may be high but they are decided by the sender. So if you don't want to pay it, lower it. Western Union fees are even higher. So it still beats the competition.

Don't worry! It will go up to a new ATH in a month :)

FWIW we've got a [weekly newsletter]( which includes a summary of the past week's market actions and news as well as a highlight of short term and long term coins to look into. We've also got a [daily online newspaper]( with the day's top crypto and blockchain news. Some of you might appreciate the content.

 has both the form you would fill out and the instructions on how to fill out. There are a few "exempt" cases that could qualify (i.e. if it's a spouse that isn't a u.s. citizen).

You could argue that you gifted him that (if you keep records) and he gifted you money, but it would sound sketchy. You should probably pay taxes.

you could look at hard forks as income and pay the approriate tax on it. Then when you sell you subtract the proceeds from the cost basis (which would be opening day prices and not 0 in this case)

If you sold it yes. If you just bought it and haven't sold yet then no.

Unfortunately no. You have a taxable event on selling Bitcoin (from the price you bought it). Then you will have a taxable event from the price you bought the alt coin to the time you sold it. Note: fees also need to be taken in account.

There is a yearly limit of 14k per person you gift money to. If over 14k, the sender needs to file a gift tax form. If under 14k, you don't need to do anything. The receiver doesn't need to file anything.

Makes sense. Ill edit my comment as I agree with you.

They may not be able to track it now, but they have unlimited resources and unlimited time. They will find a way to tax you.

Remember, the IRS requires you to self report these capital gains. You can write down whatever you want, but you take a risk of auditing. The IRS will probably go after big fishes first, but it will eventually streamline finding people that evade or incorrectly pay. The fee may be small now, but in 10 years that gain can be huge (with interest)

Edited: I believe cost basis would be 0 unless you deem it as income then my answer would change.

Judging by how the government wants as much money as possible, it is taxable.

It's probable that we will see custodial options similar to banks for cryptocurrencies. With crypto, you have the option to be in complete control of your own private keys, but if you like the comfort of trusting someone else to manage your money for you that's totally fine and businesses can be built around it. The important part is that you still have the option to own your private keys if you want to.

Lightning Network won't affect fees until ppl can actually use it to pay for daily goods. That's still a ways away, we need more channels open, more nodes, and more liquidity available. That will come with time as the applications that use LN and make it more accessible to users are developed, and as more stores start accepting it. There's a network effect with LN where we need to reach larger adoption before it really becomes useful. When it does, it will start chewing away at on\-chain transaction fees since a lot will be off\-chain. Until then, help support LN and persuade vendors to support it :\)

It's possible they sell it OTC instead of on the order books \(it's really what they're supposed to do\). If they do, then prices won't be affected at all.

There's no such thing as an "actual physical Bitcoin", this is very sketchy. It could contain a private key written on a note inside of it, but even then there's no guarantee the wallet it correlates to has any BTC in it.

Miners could signal their support before the fork, to gauge how much hash power each chain would retain. It was decided that the chain with the most hash power is the real BTC, as is the case in most hard forks
