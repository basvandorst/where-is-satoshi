@_date: 2014-04-05 11:06:00
which network?
@_date: 2014-10-30 16:34:33
I've bought on eBay before and didn't do a chargeback, not all customers are scammers.

@_date: 2014-04-06 00:09:51
Oh good. Now that I have you here... What kind of container is an sst and what does it stand for?
@_date: 2014-04-06 00:07:53

Friend in need is not a friend indeed.

Seems like a regular exchange and only send or rx between mx and argentina.   My aunt is an old retired teacher she knows nothing of btc and dont want her to have to sell with an exchange i need something simple like wu where she just enter a pin and gets cash.   Doesnt seem like theres anything like that right now. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 20:20:04
Necesito una tiendita que yo le pueda mandar btc de aca y que ella valla y le den pesos. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 20:14:27
That is unfortunate. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 22:51:52
Shes right in the center,  state of jalisco near guadalajara,  whatever would be easiest,  she doesn't like technology,  if i could give her some code or pin which she can use at atm or bank or store, whatever and never has to deal with btc just pesos would be ideal. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 20:28:00
I just tried to register to check it out and us resident accounts are not allowed lol. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 08:42:59
Much obliged. 
@_date: 2016-06-06 08:16:43
Is there an eta? 
@_date: 2016-06-28 20:25:43
Unfortunately no atms near my aunt. 
@_date: 2016-06-28 20:25:17
Thanks that looks promising,  unfortunately my aunt is very electronic illiterate and doesnt even want a cell phone,  i need something where i could deposit btc and she can cash out,  will do some reading on bitso see if i can make it work,  again,  tyvm. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:19:11
But the app doesnt do what it said it would when i downloaded it,  its worthless to me now so why wouldnt i rate it 1 star?  
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:17:52
Are you ignorant?  The company's employees and/or their accounts are being posting 5 star reviews as if they were regular customers,  thats honest to you? 
@_date: 2016-06-28 23:35:34
Shes like a nun type,  very religious as in doesnt own many possessions no bank acct,  cc,  cell phone,  she finally agreed to take some money,  was hoping to save the almost 10% fee wu charges. 
@_date: 2016-06-23 11:16:23
Dude,  as long as you dont sell you haven't lost a cent,  just you wait. 
@_date: 2017-01-26 23:54:39
Hardware wallet or paper wallet. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 09:59:50
You know darn well you didnt get receipts for every  gc you used thats just bs,  you know why you were banned. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:20:09
I did too,  but whe n i went to buy btc i didnt pass verification or whatever and it never even let me buy lol probably for the best. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 16:10:41
Then obviously that wasnt the reason why... Think for a sec you cant possibly be this stupid.

I got the name mismatch thing, somewhere i had entered "Sniperman" as a name which needed to be my real name, changed it, but still have no access. 
@_date: 2018-07-08 19:15:45
Eh not too much, i bought a couple on ebay then another set on amazon with a discount, probably 5 bucks for 2 dont really remember.  Comes in its only lil plastic [case]( 
@_date: 2018-07-08 18:27:25
[Do]( you like [mine? ](
@_date: 2016-10-02 13:57:05
Does that happen with ff too? 
@_date: 2017-05-19 20:23:00
Coinbase lets you sell and deposit to pp
@_date: 2017-05-01 08:51:04
Midlife crisis already? 
@_date: 2017-07-28 10:18:11
They dont support the fork... That means you dont get forked coins.  I dunno what will come of bcc but i like having my options. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 22:28:58
On the app?  It happened to me too this time and previously, use the website. 
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:17:47
Im not an expert, but this is how I understand it... The blockchain will split, bcc will start at the fork so the same amount you have in btc will be what you have in bcc.  So have your coins where you have your private keys, at the fork move your btc elsewhere (safety measure)  and then import that wallet that now does not have any btc into an exchange/wallet that supports bcc and do with then as you please. 
@_date: 2016-07-09 10:13:59
You realky think theres a chance itll bomb rapidly? 
@_date: 2016-07-09 11:51:20
I honestly think min 700 is going to be the new benchmark,  we were at 500 for too long.   The prize is halving and everyday we arebtgatbmuch closer to mining the final block. 
@_date: 2013-11-20 01:50:06
as i was watching i kept thinking to myself, this dude is like the tony stark of bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-03-21 15:20:21
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:45:27
Its nice to see more companys using bitcoin and any discount is better tha none, but i agree with you.
