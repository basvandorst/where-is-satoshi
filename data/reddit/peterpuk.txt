Wow, checks...
When I think of checks, it reminds me of going to the bank with my mother and see the cashier getting a cylinder with money out of a tube. To me, that was magic back in the eighties. 
I have never used a check myself, they seem to have been discontinued in 2002 in Europe:
To me, these kind of stories make me less optimistic for Bitcoin. The reason is that a lot Bitcoin enthusiasts compare Bitcoin to the US payment systems and conclude that Bitcoin is better. Maybe Bitcoin is superior in a lot of ways to the US payment systems, but it may be inferior to other systems used around the world. 
So when banks/merchants around the world face competition from Bitcoin, those banks/merchants have more options than just accepting defeat and start using Bitcoin. 
For instance, credit cards are a lot less used in the Netherlands compared to the USA. In the Netherlands, most people use iDeal for e-commerce and Bitcoin in its current form has no advantages over iDeal.
So what I'm trying to say is that the USA is not the best benchmark for Bitcoin's achievements.

In the Netherlands, we have an online payment system called iDeal, which resembles Bitcoin more than it resembles credit cards in some ways. There are no chargebacks and money is guaranteed within seconds:
This site claims that 80% of all online purchases in the Netherlands are performed with iDeal (Dutch):
So your claim that irreversibility of transactions are a big hurdle does not seem to be true (in the Netherlnds at least).

There are probably more similar systems around the world, but I think this example is enough to prove my point.
