I think in the section "Steps to protect bitcoin wallets are taken by the user as well, with strong passwords and authentication features that are very easy to use. With Bitcoin, you are your own bank" you should include examples of what strong password is/isn't and what 2 factor authorisation is/what apps you can use e.g. google authenticate.

They have said no fees, but lots of ForEx companies offer the same. They (ForEx companies) don't have fees, just a good spread between buy and sell (i.e. they buy for one price and sell at a higher price). I guess this is the same model circle will use.

I think the theory would go: If shops can offer a lower price, people will buy there more often. So although the shop doesn't see the 2% gain as it's passed on to customers, they see an increase in sales.

Bitcoin allows you to send money instantly to anyone anywhere in the world over the internet for very little cost.
The Bitcoin network is not run by a company or government, but by the people for the people.
Anyone can join the network by downloading a "wallet" for free.
The total number of Bitcoins is limited to 21 million, and they can be divided to 8 decimal places.
All bitcoin transactions are recorded on a public ledger called "the blockchain", because the ledger is public it is almost impossible to commit fraud with bitcoin.
The public ledger or "blockchain" is secured by the consenus of the network of Bitcoin users. Because the network is so big, it would take a huge amount of computing power to disrupt this network. 
Since it's inception, Bitcoin use has grown exponentially.

The article explains that banks create money when their customers take out a loan. None of my friends studying economics at Cambridge have been taught this, and I've flipped through their textbooks looking for this. The sections on money creation in these texts are all about the money multiplier theory of money creation.

Yes that's what the theory states, but that's not how money is actually created. No deposit is required, just someone willing to take out a loan.
Edi: To be clear, economic students get taught that the central bank has ultimate control of the amount of money in circulation, when in fact this is not the case as high street banks can literally just create money by issuing loans.

Taken directly from the link at the bottom:
1. Money should only be created through a democratic and transparent body working in the public interest.
We’d like to see the power to create money transferred to a democratic, accountable and transparent process, where everyone knows who has the power to create money, how much money they create, and how that money will be used. However this process is set up – whether it’s the Bank of England or a new committee that decides whether to create money, it must be accountable to Parliament and protected from abuse by vested interests. We also want to see safeguards that ensure that the right amount of money is created – not too much (causing bubbles and a financial crisis) and not too little (causing a recession).
2. Money should be created free of debt
3. Money should come into the real (non-financial) economy before it reaches financial markets and property bubbles
4. Banks should not be allowed to create money
In the short-term: Sovereign Money Creation
Sovereign Money (Cover)When we rely on banks to create most of our money, then the only way of getting more money into the economy – and allowing it to grow – is to encourage people to go further into debt. This is why UK government policy is focused on ‘getting banks lending again’ and encouraging people to borrow more for mortgages. But the financial crisis was caused by a huge build-up in private debt, so allowing that debt to increase even further could lead us into another crisis.
What we need right now is to have a way of getting extra money into the economy, but without relying on households borrowing even more. This can happen if the Bank of England creates money and transfers it to the government to be spent into the real economy (rather than the financial or property markets). Our Sovereign Money proposal explains how this could work, how it would lead to a boost in jobs and employment, and how it would make the current debt-fuelled recovery into a sustainable one.
In the Long Term:
Ultimately, we think that the economy would be more stable and society better off if we completely remove the power that banks have to create money. These ideas have been around since the 1930s, but we’ve done a lot of work to update them for the modern financial system.

Nice one. Here are my suggestions:
"extremely lower" is not great English... try "vastly", or 
"much" lower. Or perhaps "so much lower you will see the benefits to your bottom line within a month". Or perhaps even "you're probably paying around 2% for cards, you'd pay X amount for bitcoin"
Why not mention bitpay as well as coinbase?
"on the rise" sounds a bit weak, try "bitcoin use is growing exponentially"
Don't "beg", just "ask".

"Fractional Reserve Banking is generally well-understood by anyone who takes a few minutes to learn how it works. "
I do not think this is the case at all. Economic students have been  taught the "money multiplier" theory of fractional reserve banking, which is not correct at all (and they are still, I have friends who study econmics at Cambridge and I've seen their textbooks). They are not taught that private high-street banks create money by issuing loans, which the BofE has just stated they do. If more people realised that we have given the power to create money to high-street banks, I think there would be calls for this to change. Indeed, organisation like  are calling for fundamental changes to the way money is created.

Yes they do. That is exactly what the bank of England has just said. Here is a quote from Mervin King (made in a speech to the South Wales Chamber of Commerce at The Millenium Centre, Cardiff on 23rd October 2012:
 "When banks extend loans to their customers, they create money by crediting their customers’ accounts."

I don't know why you're being downvoted. The point of ethereum is to make "building things on top" so much easier. Bitcoin's script is intentionally limited, so you have to do work-arounds to implement some really cool features on top of it.

I'm afraid that until an exchange manages to utilise the UK's free, more or less instant bank transfer system, it doesn't matter to me whether they're a UK company or not, they only compete on the same level as any European exchange if they are using SEPA transfers to take my money.

I would point out that there is some talk in the community that jan 31st will see a price reduction based on it being the deadline for 3rd party financial companies to stop bitcoin activities. If there is no drop on or near this date, I forsee a little rally. For this reason, I would dollar cost average from now to after this period to hedge against potential wild swings in the market.

Because while they share many beliefs with typical bitcoiners, the guys at positive money want the power to create money to be (essentially) in the hands of the state (via a separate body). Because bitcoin creation can't be controlled, they wouldn't advocate it's adoption over their proposals. 
I really respect their work, and I think it's probably fair to say that these guys are the reason money creation is being debated by the UK parliament.

I would suggest that Co-Op bank's principles are better than other bank's (even after the recent changes) if you are about what they use their money to fund (e.g. Barclays/HSBC/NatWest will happily fund arms manufacturers whereas Co-Op won't.

The main difference (from what I have gathered) is that BTC can be converted to MPesa using this service, which people without internet can have on non-smart phones, and they don't need a bank account either. It looks like the best remittance service using Bitcoin in the world so far to me. Not needing a bank to receive international remittance is a pretty huge deal.

I think perhaps you miss my point. The idea that banks won't get in to bitcoin because it would tarnish their reputations is ridiculous.

If they really have around a 15 minute time period in which the price is locked in to sell, they are going to get a flood of people using the service during a crash, putting in orders to sell, then waiting 10 minutes for the price to drop more on exchanges where they can restock.

From reading positivemoney.org.uk's work, my understanding is that in fact there are no restrictions to the amount that can be created by private banks (through the issuance of loans).

I can;t see why not... I'm using both regularly. My feeling is that transferwise won't be necessary when more people in more countries are using bitcoin, as they essentially act as a middleman for people who want to do remittance between themselves, and once both parties in this exchange can use bitcoin to do it, they won't need transferwise.

paying off debts reduces the amount of money in the economy, not increase it.

To me it doesn't really fit with those proposals, but it is another way to take the power to create money away form private institutions which is something that I believe should happen.

Airbnb renters pay in advance, owners get paid 2 days after the guest checks in, so airbnb hold lots of cash balance. If they accepted bitcoin, they would hold a big bitcoin balance. I'm not sure how willing owners would be to accept bitcoin because if the value crashed between the time the booking was made (sometimes months in advance) and the stay, they would end up receiving an amount in BTC which is significantly less than they would "usually" rent their apartment out for. Only people who are already in to BTC and belivie in its future would accept this risk.
9flats, who I think ask for payment nearer the booked date already do accept BTC

Maybe my logic is flawed, but if they just hoard it rather than spend it,then it seems to me that this will have less effect on inflation than if the same money was distributed evenly amongst the population and spent by them?

Similar proposals made by  who advocate for sovereign money, are what got me interested in monetary policy in the first place. This in turn s what led to me finding out about bitcoin. I'm actually a strong advocate of both ideas. Both are vastly better than the system we have now. I highly recommend you take some time to look through positive money's proposals... they make a lot of sense and are really interesting. They are certainly not "going full Karl Marx".
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:59:20
The intro video is OK, but doesn't address your concerns, which their full proposals do. Saying their ideas are niave after watching a 3 minute video is ignorant in the truest sense of the word. Calling me naive for believing in the benefits of their system is insulting, particularly when you are niave to their ideas.
I think we'll have to agree to disagree.  It will be interesting to see if Iceland do go down this route so we can see these ideas in action. I believe that they would bring prosperity to the nation.
@_date: 2015-04-10 12:47:29
OK, so it was in response to the Icelandic sovereign money proposal not about bitcoin, and I did leave off the word "alone" from the end of that quote, but that's still a remarkable statement from a former FSA chairman.
@_date: 2015-04-02 09:40:49
Have you read (in-depth) the proposals set out by positivemoney.org.uk? I think you are arguing against something which I'm not advocating. 
Giving the keys of money creation to government would lead (and has historically) led to inappropriate spending. They argue for a system in which an independent "monetary creation committee" would decide how much money gets created.
Please read their ideas before responding again. Particularly the answers to common critiques section, from which I have copied this: 
The Money Creation Committee would be responsible for just two things: a) identifying the increase in the money stock needed to promote non-inflationary growth, and b) keeping an eye out for a shortage of credit to the real economy. They are not responsible for deciding how to spend newly created money, as this decision is given to the elected government (just as with the decision on how to spend all tax revenue). Neither are they responsible for deciding which businesses get loans or investment, as this decision remains with banks (and the savers who provide them with funds). The job of lending is left to the markets.
After a lot of reading on the idea, I am persuaded that it is "vastly better than the system we have now", so I stand firmly by that claim.

I'm sorry but you are talking bollocks. Canada has removed reserve requirements. Just google it. I just did and the top result was a paper written by the bank of Canada called "Implementation of Monetary Policy in aRegime with Zero Reserve Requirements"
The following is from moneyterms.co.uk/reserve-requirement/:
"Reserve requirements have tended to fall over the years because the effectiveness of reserve requirements have been questioned. Banks have found methods for circumventing them. Some countries (including the UK and Canada) have eliminated reserve requirements altogether or lowered them to negligible levels. This appears to have worked well. Their reasons include:
-Banks have found ways of circumventing reserve requirements. 
-Banks in the US commonly sweep money overnight from accounts that are subject to a reserve requirement to accounts that are not. 
-The extra cost increases costs to banks compared to other ways of financing debt, distorting the market."

Hi Danny, as an investor in NEOBEE, I'm really excited about this. Congratulations on a fantastic achievement, you continually impress.
I also realise that this info is being released before you wanted it to be. Now that it has been though, could you clarify what sort of prices we might expect per BTC over, say, the bitstamp price?

I've been considering the idea of starting a donation page for the next big disaster (like the Tsunami or the Phillipines), but pre-emptively. So people donate and the BTC sit there until a crisis occurs, at which point the (hopefully by then much more valuable) BTC get sold and given to charity. A $10 dollar donation today could make an absolutely huge difference in the future.
@_date: 2013-12-04 16:23:03
Good luck. For buying your bitcoins, use localbitcoins.com. Use a trusted (high feedback score) seller.

That is not a Gandhi quote. He actually said "stop misquoting me". Nicholas Klein did once say in a trade union address:
"And, my friends, in this story you have a history of this entire movement. First they ignore you. Then they ridicule you. And then they attack you and want to burn you. And then they build monuments to you" Which I actually think is better.
@_date: 2013-10-08 09:23:07
That is awesome news, but please dont get greedy on the fees... Transferwise now send remittances for .5% we need a Btc option to beat that, not western union. Also bear in mind anyone can do a btc remittance for one percent by opening a bitpay seller account.
@_date: 2013-04-17 09:40:12
No problem. Thanks anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-05 16:05:36
I think he massively underestimates the potential of BTC's market cap. If a few more hedge funds come to play next year, things will look radically different. Also, why won't a BTC player dominate on the world remittance market? The average fee is around 9% for gods sake... there' so much money to be made there by a company using BTC as their back-end (like NEOBEE will be next year).
@_date: 2013-11-11 09:49:03
I decided right from the outset that I will give half of any profits I make to charity... it's free money, I don't deserve it... to be honest 50% still seems a bit much but I'm a greedy bastard and want to help myself and those I love.

I am in Bitcoin for the same reason I have donated to positivemoney.org.uk; because I want to put some of my money towards changing the way money is created. I believe the "money issued as debt" way of creating money is simply ridiculous and I want that to change. 
I can't deny that the idea of that the fact that it would make me rich if BTC does survive the huge amount of resistance it will face from governments and financial institutions keeps me more interested in it than I am in the work of the guys at positivemoney though.

It doesn't make sense right now, there are cheaper ways to send money than localbitcoins.com. I send money from the UK to Italy fairly regularly and Transferwise is still the cheapest method. I can't understand why someone in the BTC world hasn't made a cheaper way to do it yet, but I'm sure it will come in time.

I'm sure it is, I'm just saying that when I had heard that the BIT had raised 70 million, I imagined more than 90 people had invested in it, and that finding this out was surprising to me.

Well, the price could go down too over the time it takes to get into an exchange, then you'd be paying a premium and getting stuck with overpriced coins.

@_date: 2013-10-07 13:12:55
Jumping on to this conspiracy bandwagon, perhaps having a huge headstart in mining bitcoins as "satoshi" did would mean they would care less about the USD losing it's power, as they'd have such a huge chunk of XBT?

All the media attention is sustaining these prices, and as more people find out about BTC, the price goes up because they want some. People who bought at the all time high just over a week ago are up $100 per Bitcoin.

How are you, and how much are you going to spend on marketing?
What will your fees (if any) be?

My point is that a rational actor who sees the same item for sale in two places and it's cheaper in one of those places will buy from there. The shop offering the discount gets more sales and therefore more profit, so it makes sense for them to offer the discount if they can.
@_date: 2013-10-26 08:46:28
He talks about profit limitations and wealth redistribution because he's pissed off about economic inequality. It seems clear to me that a model in which 180 Russians own more than 350000000 other Russians needs to be changed. 
I take his point on voting and recycling etc being pressure valves but I don't agree with not voting, or not recycling... just vote for someone you actually agree with, not one of the corporate-backed assholes the main parties put forward.

It's a bit hidden for some reason, but I think you can do it... on the main screen, under "you send" next to 1000 there is a drop down box... select "other", then on the screen which pops up there is another drop down box in which you can find United States dollar. Hope that helps : )

@_date: 2013-09-27 09:05:02
I think the biggest risk is that the establishment (central bankers), will see it as a threat and decide to ruin Bitcoin. The market cap of BTC is just tiny, and it would be easy to tank the market if you had enough cash. This is what stops me from putting more money in.

What we need is what the cypriots get next year.. Neo bank and the bee payment network.

Slightly off topic, but was there ever a good explanation given for the SR logo being in the background of the takedown notice?

Danny (CEO of NEOBEE) has confirmed here:

Yeah, but one can assume that at least some of the people who were clueless/stupid enough to throw away their hard drives would also be stupid enough to have an easily brute-forced password.

Nice. I'll give it a go: 1F3m8p4taUbfhAwzDtTgdNkuUV9EiDfZRc

Yeah, in the UK most transfers are pretty much instant now. We're still buying bitcoin (at localbitcoin prices) over here, so don't worry!

That appears to be a US site, I don;t want to have to pay shipping and then import tax... thanks though.

NeoBee just demo'd their POS system at the cyprus investor show today too. Things are a-changing. The Bee system can be used with Bee debit cards, or any wallet.

I have no idea why you're being downvoted...

"People are going to buy at that website or store regardless if they accept BTCs or not." 
I would choose to shop at somewhere offering a discount over one which wasn't.

Looks good, but two reddit posts and 0 feedback on clinging... I just can't bring myself to do it... too many scammers out there.

Thanks so much for your well thought out and informative answer, and for the tip!
Is there a thread which explains how the tipbot works, so I might brighten someone elses day in the future?
@_date: 2013-10-18 13:01:33
Bugger. Thanks for the heads-up.

Hustle-free? Excellent! I hate getting hussled when I'm buying booze. May I suggest stocking zubrowka bison grass flavoured vodka? I will buy lots from you if the price is right... I currently buy for £20 a bottle here in the UK, please beat that!

No, English is not my first language, I meant I would like to see his bum.

They will enable funding from around 250000 locations in the UK alone, and they will be launching in 6 EU countries. This will be from early 2014.

Is the network standard for a transfer fee really $1 now? That's got to change.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:00:35
Yes, I really struggle to see where they got their numbers from. It just seems obvious that if BTC really takes off with the global populace, it will be worth vastly more than it's current valuation.
@_date: 2013-11-28 12:29:22
Nice one Tabby : )
Mind if I ask where you're based? I have a few mates who are writers/artists (do you know of mr penfold?) who I've been trying to get interested in BTC. I'd like to put on the first BTC only gallery show in London. Would you be interested in taking part?
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:23:33
Go to Havelock investments, sign up, and then it's all pretty self-explanatory. Or you can buy direct from NEOBEE through  but be warned that the lmb site is not a market, so transfering the shares to another person might be difficult. Also the Havelock rate is slightly less right now, so it makes sense to buy there in my opinion.
@_date: 2013-11-27 16:30:20
Yes, I'm pretty disappointed. I'm sure it'll be great.
@_date: 2013-12-18 15:18:30
well that's one way of looking at it. Personally I believe private institutions being able to create money out of thin air is criminal, which is why I back BTC.
@_date: 2013-04-24 11:07:06
You could always use localbitcoins.com... Prices are higher, but not if you factor in the price increase while you've been waiting.*
*warning prices may go up or down!

Nice. The UK gov ihas already stated it will block websites with pornography and "extremist material".

I'd love to know the answer to this...
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:59:01
that was not one person.
@_date: 2013-10-29 15:39:03
This is good advice.

"Assuming Bitcoin becomes (1) a major player in both e- commerce and money transfer and (2) a significant store of value with a reputation close to silver, our fair value analysis implies a maximum market capitalization of Bitcoin of $15bn (1BTC = 1300 USD)."
What? I would love to see who's bum they pulled those numbers from.

Yes, you'd be buying the shares described in the prospectus. The last 90 days have been the only days shares have been available. The first couple of months were fairly quiet news-wise, and saw a steady drop, but now more details about the company and it's revenue streams (i.e. easyco.in/zip zap partnership, the cypriot university aceepting and using BTC and Neo's services etc) have been released, the share price is picking up again. Hope that helps.
