I don't agree with your world view but ok here:
Help!! I took advantage of parts of the organized crime system that benefit me and now I need help avoiding the parts I don't like!!!

This is the best post I've ever seen from this subreddit, grats.

No, it really does... Eminent Domain is real thing, and so are government services in this country, they have yet to be ruled unconstitutional if you haven't noticed. It's not true because I said it, it's true because that's the law, it is objectively true.

Wait what? So its moral to profit from selling murder and child porn?

Falsely reporting the source of income isn't a type of fraud?

There are people who compare all taxes to some kind of bully extorting you and therefore are theft (the gov'ment is literally robbing me!!!). There are a whole mess of reasons why this view is pretty extreme when considering how societies function, but the short answer is: Yes, a lot people (especially fervent bitcoin fans) think taxes are always equal bad.

Is slavery equal to drug trafficking, hired assassinations and potentially any other crime you need to hide the source of income from? Why is it moral to profit off of facilitating such an exchange?

Are you referring to the revenue ruling they issued clarifying bitcoin's status as property? This is not a new regulation, it is a clarification of bitcoin should be treated under the current revenue code. The regulation was always there, there was just no official statement until then.

The bottle caps would be taxable (though the value of a bottle cap would probably be so negligible no one would care), all income is gross income.
Treasure trove isn't a new concept and it extends to the fair market value of property (gold, your bottle caps, bitcoin etc.), not just cash.

The true heart of a bitcoiner. IF ONLY THIS DAMN FIAT WASN'T STOPPING ME FROM CARING!!

These are bitcoiners, context only matters when they want it to.

Ok? I get you disagree with the way the government works, but it in fact does work that way and have those powers, there is no opt-out feature you so desperately want to exist. I and many others think this is a good thing.
You turned an ironic snark about a guy who used a system to his advantage and then got bit in the ass as launching point to start advocating your tired nonaggression principal beliefs. I don't need to prove anything to you because you really aren't going to say anything I haven't seen repeated over and over again on this sub, so please save it.
@_date: 2014-12-19 05:53:07
From the shit that gets posted here I'd have to say yes.
@_date: 2014-07-28 22:47:01
Your metaphor is bad. 
Yes the government does have those rights.

Did you really jump from food and work safety standards to genocide based on username preference?

Well yeah when you break a law you are a criminal duh. If they force feed him he can always hang himself with his underwear, that'll show those men with guns.

Still nothing good to buy with bitcoin.

What do you mean morally owe? As opposed to legally owed?
The complaint alleges he knowingly allowed people from silk road to move money through their systems coming from illegal sources. Do you think that is ok? 
@_date: 2015-05-21 06:25:41
So you are cool with states deciding to be tyrannical so long as it isn't  federal?

You should discuss the most certain thing in life (besides death), tax consequences! If cryptocurrency becomes a mainstay you can bet every government on earth is going to want their due...

Doesn't child porn already accept it?

Do they immediately covert it into USD? Why not just give them that instead of fantasy dollars?
