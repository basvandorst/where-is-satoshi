The market accepted being manipulated to $18,000+ so why wouldn't it accept the reverse?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:29:43
I'm not really sure you had a point.
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:56:11
Please explain if its so simple.  The sarcasm would indicate the person meant the opposite, or at least different than, what was stated but the statement is in fact true so the sarcasm would indicate that the person doesnt know what they are talking about.  So break it down for me a wise one.

Setting it up as we speak, thanks!

Paying 20-30% in taxes on your income means you can't make money?  Are you mathematically illiterate?
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:29:00
No, you're not.  Stop bringing up questions you already know the answer to.  I have literally seen you argue the answer to this question in other posts.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:08:58
You aren't being taxed on the money you are risking, you're being taxed on the INCOME you made.  Pretty fucking simple concept.  It's literally called an INCOME tax, what's so hard to grasp about that?  I use post tax dollars to invest in the stock market and I am taxed on the gains.  I use tax dollar to purchase items and resell for a profit and I am taxed on the gains.  Why the fuck shouldn't you be taxed on you profits?
And by the way this is completely false:


They absolutely do regulate it.  The IRS has outlined EXACTLY how to handle the gains from bitcoin.  Stop being ignorant.

Coinbase isn't down...
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:10:54
What's the "/s" for?  If you don't make a profit from the bitcoin you aren't taxed.  It's pretty goddamn simple concept.  The IRS has provided very clear guidelines on the topic.

You don't want him to give out free money for a treasure hunt because you want free money to get your idea going?  Seems rather biased and hypocritical.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:11:48
No one is saying you need to pay tax on unrealized gains.  Stop being a fucking moron for just one second.

The devs don't make money off fees, the miners do.  
@_date: 2017-12-04 13:58:53
The IRS did release guidance on how exactly to handle bitcoin.  [It falls under capital gains taxes as it is an asset. It really couldn't have been made more clear.](  Not sure what exactly you might be confused about as this is 3.5 year old clarification directly from the IRS, not just "some website."
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:41:13
Or he just might be right.  I'm all about getting away with what you can to minimize your tax liability but to make the argument that profiting off of Bitcoin is not a taxable thing in the US is assinine.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:32:13
Feel free to explain your comment then.  There's really no other way to take it accept as insulting.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:06:14
A lame one at best.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:15:19
Thanks dude!
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:43:41


You did say that moron.
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:43:00
I appreciate the logic and rational discussion you are providing.  Your information may not be popular in this sub but you are 100% correct.

Still playing Rust?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:39:36
I'm right there with you dude.  I had unfortunately been mining with Nicehash for a bit longer and just hadn't gotten around to installing my own bitcoin wallet because of how big the blockchain download was so I lost a fair amount more.  Lesson learned I guess, starting that blockchain download as we speak.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:09:39
Are you attempting to insult someone for the amount of money they are willing/able to spend?  You should realize these kind of comments are in poor taste.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:07:08
You must be bad at math.  10% being the smallest double digit, if there were 10 of them no one else would  bitcoin.
