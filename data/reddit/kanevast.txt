I used to use Android about 5 or so years ago.
It was convenient in some ways but also much more buggy.
My car example essentially is supposed to express that Apple works exactly how it should and is designed very cleanly and well, I.e it’s a high quality product.
My more recent experiences with Android were using XiaoMi phones (a Chinese brand of android os phones) which are total rubbish.
How do you see android being ahead? Any specific examples ?
I used to be android and PC.
Then I started using Mac OS and OSi and felt everything was just more intuitive, didn’t crash and wasn’t a clusterfuck.

Yeah, I got 11 downvotes for laughing about an app being currently only available on Android.
I’d say it’s pretty funny.

Wow, just googled this and I’m surprised.
Essentially it says that more people outside “the west” use Android and that it’s essentially a Hyundai.
Whereas Apple iOS is more popular in western countries and is like a Ferrari or rolls royce.
I don’t disagree with ur view.
Still prefer Apple though, Android has always crashed a lot or just felt clunky and unfinished.

The claim that the app is good but it’s on Android.
That’s pretty funny to me cause I’m an Apple user.
I’m not saying the app that guy made is good or bad, I don’t know, as I can’t test it.
