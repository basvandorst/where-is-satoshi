Thank you, the clarification is much appreciated.

pmpl, hell this is funny :)
Thanks for making my evening.

You are correct, that was more of a "correction".
The gf asked me about "altcoins" a while back and why people call Ethereum that. My comment basically was "if you have seen all the copy the code and change it a bit" shyte most of the old-timers in BTC have seen, you would call anything crypto an alt. Ethereum needs to prove itself - I did enough research to think it is different enough and not the typical crap... but that is me... if I didn't do the research, I would also dismiss it as a "I have seen this movie before - more than once"
Don't really care either way, people are free to have their own opinions - that is what makes things interesting.
Anyway, we are in - need to get back on topic here :)

Yes Bitcoin supporters can have investments in other coins, e.g. me in ETH. Ethereum is not self-aware yet... well, if it is, it is not coming clean about it... yet.
I also had around 2.27 BTC (exchange -&gt; wallet) "stuck" for 90 minutes yesterday, have no real control over the fees, the exchange adds them - looking back the size of the fees seemed ok, my timing was probably just horrible. It was probably deemed spam, I'm honestly not sure what counts as valid anymore. Not complaining about it though, it wasn't urgent, just irritated me a bit...
@_date: 2016-01-27 14:26:49
Shhh... Don't let spam-boy know his tactics paid off. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:24:20
The way I see it, eg. IMHO the fees won't go. However having some slightly larger workspace would mean they won't increase to crazy levels either. 
How you implement the "slghtly larger workspace", well, let's see what wins out.  
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:26:37
Agreed. It s not perfect for everybody. But in the 3rd world chances are you have more trouble getting your grubby paws on bitcoing anyway - and it all adds up :(

Not flamebait (I know when specified with that monicker it typically is, but bear with me), I just want to clarify my understanding - 
I'm convinced I read that Blockstream doesn't really have a vested interest in LN, or rather basically have no developers assigned to it. (Bar 1, no doubt doing great work). 
This article points to "Blockstream's LN" - did I miss something?
@_date: 2016-03-01 18:01:19
ELI5 - so I buy coins off an exchange (like I did yesterday before getting caught in some backlog) - does that mean I always will need to wait to receive them since these are new?
I honestly don't like that at all. Well, I could live with it since transfers from my exchange to my wallet is not urgent, but still... I would prefer to have fast-ish transactions at any time.

In all fairness, there was a bit of a "dump" after it hit $6.25 the first time around.
Having said that, as an investor in both BTC &amp; ETH, I find ETH still undervalued. (Take that as a pump) It is no doubt interesting.
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:57:09
It has different reasons for the upswing, i.e. contracts.
It will have to go a long way to solve scaling issues. 
All, IMHO, of course. 
@_date: 2016-01-27 10:11:00
It is sad. A couple of trolls doing more damage than they should. Ethereum is interesting in its own right, but soamming is not the way to go no matter who you are.

Honestly, I believe my "problem" was legitimate. However, if I had to post that as a top-level post, I would probably be accused of all 3 categories and would come out -
1. Alt Coiners - looking at my post history, I post in the Ethereum forums. So that is a "Check".
2. Big Block Extremists - I visit and frequent both the competing forums, I have my own views on the matter, but I try to keep a clear head. I just want what is best in the long term. So, I guess based on my posting patterns, that is also a "Check".
3. Sock Puppet - Been on Reddit for a very long time, however this account is 1 month old. (Or so it tells me above). So that is a "Check"
3/3 "Checks" - I must be guilty of being one of the baddies :) 
Anyway... whatever causes this crap, it needs to go away. Spam, sizes, excuses, etc. - I honestly don't care too much, just don't want it around. 
I have had the gf on BTC for the last 2 months or so - we are in different countries, I have a very good reason (baby on the way) to send her funds, BTC is by far the best, fastest and cheapest option from my 3rd-world country to her 1st-world country. 
I really don't want to explain why transfers "don't go through" - we all want a stable network, we all want BTC to succeed, and for me, I don't want to make excuses for my chosen transfer network. (I don't have choices - BTC or wire transfers, and that is not an option when you have serious exchange controls in place.)

This. 
Having more information than most is important, not being a sheep (or lemming) even moreso. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:32:16
This. 
By design. Whether we lke it or not. Whether it agrees with our belefs or not.
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:16:28
I see what you did there...
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:21:31
Agreed. If I squint my eyes, I see something...
@_date: 2016-01-27 10:08:28
I feel like I missed out on a beer here. 
(Sorry, that is the only insight I can add)
@_date: 2016-01-28 19:14:13
Despite what some say - any useful payment system is quick. It needs ro be. 
@_date: 2016-01-28 18:19:48
Maybe in the future, but at this point only what has been discussed ad naseum - an increase. It is polarising enough as it stands. 
@_date: 2016-02-21 21:00:08


Nope, it is not what I had in mind when I bought by first piece of BTC.
Having said that - it became more of a transfer mechanism (where it does the job brilliantly) for me than a store of value. If the quote was not as true, I guess I would still have had quite a large longer-term holding.
