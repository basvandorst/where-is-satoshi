Great post! Thank you for laying out the big picture. I also was not aware of the NYA/S2X shadiness and fragility. I feel this new drama (another of many takeover attempts) will not end well for Roger, Jihan, Silbert, Bcash/BCC/BCH/ABC/S2X, same as all previous failures to coopt Bitcoin. Bitcoin is antifragile, Moneybadger don't care.
 This post by Core is also great in order to have clarity on the current situation:
Mods: as many have requested, please sticky the Core post, even if it's just for a short while.

Segwit + Lightning network= larger blocks (capacity), low fees and instant transactions. Then we have Blockstack and many more improvements to come. Bcash is just a pumped altcoin with no real value or network, it is unsafe and has a crappy code, the same for Segwit2X, and all their co-opt attempt predecessors: Bitcoin Unlimited, XT, Classic, etc.
With Bitcoin we get the best of all worlds, with competent developers and a strong and safe network. We can implement everything we need on layers on top, no need to mess with the main chain, which is what makes Bitcoin invincible: Immutability.

Wrong, the internet is decentralized, also, don't be so pessimistic and afraid,  even if the internet goes down, it will be only temporary, and anyway, bitcoin can be stored offline on paper or hardware wallets and transferred via radiofrequency/radiowaves, a peer-to-peer decentralised system is not going to disappear, the future systems will be decentralised and digital. And now Bitcoin does not depend on the internet: ”Bitcoin Comes From Satellites In Space”:

Bitcoin’s value derives from its current real uses (mainly for money transfers and remittances) its limited supply and scarcity (store of value) and its many potential uses. Also, behind the curtains there is a huge growth in the bitcoin ecosystem development that a regular folk can't see because it's ignored by the media.
If you buy for day trading you may lose money, but if you hold long term, it has been proven you get nice ROI. And bitcoin has barely started, think of the Internet/email in the 90's. A decentralized technology that has a valuable use it's not going to disappear, even if a few tyrannical governments try to "ban" it.
Check these great articles:
["What Gave Bitcoin Its Value?"]
["How do Bitcoins have value?"](
Bitcoin is becoming more and more practical by the week, like for worldwide cheap and fast money transfers (remittances) to 3rd world underbanked Countries. Email in the 90's: "It needs to be easier to send", or Internet then also: "It needs to be easier to use". Bitcoin is just beginning but it will have a huge impact, I think the future economy will be digital and decentralized.
Bitcoin is a worldwide-distributed decentralized peer-to-peer censorship-resistant trustless and permissionless deflationary system/currency (see [Blockchain](  technology) backed by mathematics, open source code, cryptography and the most powerful and secure decentralized computational network on the planet, orders of magnitude more powerful than google and government combined. There is a limit of 21 million bitcoins (divisible in smaller units). "Backed by Government" money is not backed by anything and is infinitely printed at will by Central Banks. Bitcoin is limited and decentralized.
**Receive and transfer money, from cents (micropayments) to thousands:**
* Cheap regardless of amount $$$ sent (new apps will make it cheaper)
* Borderless (no country can stop it from going in/out or confiscate)
* Trustless (nobody needs to trust anybody for it to work)
* Privacy (no need to expose personal information)
* Securely (encrypted cryptographically and can’t be confiscated)
* Permissionless (no approval from central powers needed)
* Instantly (from seconds to a few minutes)
* Open source (auditable by anybody)
* Worldwide distributed (from anywhere to anywhere on the planet)
* Censorship resistant (no government can stop its use)
* Peer-to-peer (no intermediaries with a cut)
* Portable (easier to carry/move than cash, gold and silver)
* Public ledger (transparent, seen by everybody)
* Scalable (each bitcoin is divisible down to 8 decimals)
* Decentralized (distributed with no single point of failure)
* Deflationary (its supply goes down with time until reaching 21 million ever)
* Immutable global registry (can’t be altered/hacked by nobody)
* No chargebacks-No fraud ('push' vs' 'pull' transactions).﻿
*And that’s just as currency, Bitcoin has many more uses and applications.*

In a few years you will be surprised by how cheap bitcoin was, we are still at a very early adoption stage  ;)

Yeah, the timing couldn't be better!
For all the newbies commenting here about how they "missed the boat" or they "panic-sold", remember to always Hodl! (and buy the dips/corrections). Always ignore the FUD, don't sell your coins or you will always regret it later. Also, remember all this regarding Bitcoin investment:
