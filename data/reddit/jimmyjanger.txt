I have to admit that crypto is very young and not fully developed. I believe it will be possible to loan money to someone and secure it with a smart contract. 
I have a counter question: are you happy with the current financial system?? -1% of the worlds population owns what percentage of the earth? -I live in Germany and here I get negative interest in my savings. -The average currency lasts 27 years, usually gets destroyed because of greedy institutions like banks. The banks survive because the people bail them out, whether they like it or not. Just look at the financial crisis in 2008. The banks all walked away while you and I are paying for it. -Venezuela hyperinflation Shall I continue?
To sum it up: something has to change and a p2p monetary system is better than the banking system that got us into this mess. Crypto is not perfect but better than what we have now and I chose better every single time.

IMO bitcoin is one of the best inventions in the financial sector ever. Bitcoin means power to the people as you don’t depend on banks or anyone else. I’m not surprised that there are institutions out there that want to see bitcoin fail as they have a lot!! to lose. In the meantime I’ll keep buying and do some dca. Bitcoin will stay and shoot up sooner or later. No doubt about that. That’s my 2 cents (or satoshi) :)

“On a basic level, bitcoin loans work like your standard term loan: It's borrowed money that you pay back plus interest and fees over a predetermined period of time. ... The easiest way to get a bitcoin loan is through a peer-to-peer platform that connects investors with borrowers, usually for a fee”
