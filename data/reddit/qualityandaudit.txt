Isn't Bitcoin "owned" by like three devs paid by one company owned by AXA?

So many new people here not realizing that DNM helped bitcoin grow and without them it would be nothing like it is today. Might have not taken off at all.

I keep seeing people think Markov retrenchments are necessary for a Dozhnejevsky-Zalman uplift.
I've been analyzing Bitcoin since 2006, and let me tell you, these oscillations mean nothing in the grand scheme.
If anything we're in a zebra market.

So LN is actually not a direct fix, we just hope it will take some of the load off the mempool that the other transactions can go through. 
Also you think common people want to bother learning about opening and closing some weird channels with different addresses and stuff? Why not just choose a coin that works out of the box

I still don't get the whole "if everyone used segwit right now overnight" argument.
How does presenting a hypothetical scenario that simply won't happen help anything? If everyone stopped killing each other the world would be a nicer place. Well yes, but that's not how it works.

Yeah, it's quite rubbish at the moment, either wait for ages or pay an exorbitant transaction fee. We're at 67k unconfirmed transactions and it looks like it's just getting worse.
I don't have much technical knowledge about how bitcoin works so perhaps someone more knowledgeable could explain why it's been this way since yesterday.
