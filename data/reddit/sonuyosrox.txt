i am still confused, as you said that fees are high in blockchain due to many small deposits, so if i have many small deposits in my ledger, the fees will rise there too?
@_date: 2019-07-19 06:23:45


So its like a 25th variable that changes everything??


But $89 difference? No matter how much high? Also can you tell me what you mean by highly fragmented?
1 more question, can i have multiple address in ledger?
@_date: 2019-07-19 07:01:22


So even in ledger if i have multiple small transaction, it will build up to the same amount as blockchain?
Also 1 more question, segwit (3) or native segwit (bc)?
@_date: 2019-07-19 08:23:57
oh, this is so confusing and bad.
Gotta wait till fees hit 1sat/byte and then send.
@_date: 2019-07-19 06:54:15
yea, so wen someone sends me the money, shouldnt it be signed then only as they are paying fees?
Compared to ledger where i pay so less fees compared to blockchain? it baffles me.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:46:58
Oh, this is a good info, however i still dont know how much bytes will ~0.3BTC take to transfer?
ELI5. I am very noob in this.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:34:49
I am kinda noob, please tell me more.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:50:55
I am using blockchain. It is asking me for $272 fees for 0.3BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-20 06:07:21
I actually sent using 1sat/byte about 10mins ago, got confirmed. :P
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:01:38
I have received tiny btc on multiple (i think so) address. So what to do now?Anyway to get it sorted with least amount of BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:18:03
$272 for fees?
@_date: 2019-06-29 04:24:25
I am not talking about buying, am talking about selling.
@_date: 2019-06-29 14:52:34
I ordered from ninjadodo
@_date: 2019-06-30 13:12:01
What are you planning to do?
I ended up ordering from Ledger.com and using Shopandship.com
I hope it works out as they handle customs.
@_date: 2019-06-29 08:11:54
Nano S is available, but X isn't :(
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:39:47


Thats what i use mate, i use LBC &amp; Blockchain.info.
LBC so i can sell with ease, and blockchain as backup.
@_date: 2019-06-29 15:07:32
Ninjadodo is indian company.
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:25:39
I am not buying binance, i meant binance.com, if i can keep my btc over there for elongated period and then exchange btc to usdc.
@_date: 2019-06-29 19:04:05
I just got S for now, I will see how it goes.
Then later will get X or another S.

50bucks for 1k$.
Now think someone is holiday, so 10BTC, thats 120k right away, 5% is $6k of that 120k.
@_date: 2019-06-28 07:18:29
I am not selling now, i am selling once it hits 20k, as thats my goal, but i cannot bring back home witout attracting government, thats why i need some place where i can convert my btc to fiat.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:06:40
But with the rising fees, it can take 3-5% fees with each transfer, wouldnt it?
@_date: 2019-06-28 06:52:44
Any other option?
@_date: 2019-06-28 10:37:32


Because nothing bad has ever happened when someone went to different country or their own country to get cash :v :P
@_date: 2019-06-29 18:20:23
I am gonna open it and check, don't worry.
@_date: 2019-06-28 11:24:19
No i wont, 20k would be enough for me, i dont need anymore too tbh.
