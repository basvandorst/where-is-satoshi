Gift cards are a great development tactic, a bridging mechanism.
Have you actually managed to 'sign anyone up on the spot,' and thereby get fiat for Btc?

Good idea, Chris. I
It's in the same vein is the thing that drives IndiaMikeZulu, a trust-based 'federation' of people with different talents. We should set up a hang-out place for Litecoin users who speak other languages. If Litecoiners enter non-English-speaking markets first, we get a head start.

Hey, Skitchen!
not only do I think you should mention it, but we need a movement to locate a Bitcoin-neutral bank, and announce that fact in the crypto-sphere, so people can move their accounts to that bank.
The libertarian and commercial aspects of cryptos have plenty of overlapping interests. Commercial developers are 'running block' for the phenomenon, and it would be very wise for us all to support them in their struggle with the bureaucracy.

Let's straighten out a coupla things here: most posters here are from nations in which 'vestigial democracy/affluence' allows considerable opposition to the government.
I lived for years in Indonesia, in part during the dictatorship, and recall the constant fear that constrains **every single thing you do or say every day**. 
These Chinese that you expect to buck the system, how do they know that their ISP isn't giving data to guys who rape people in cellars? How do they know that the waiter who looks over their shoulder in the cafe while they are sending cryptos isn't a snitch? How do they know that 'terrorists' or 'counter-revolutionaries' might not be sought for in their lounge room -- oh! and look! a Bitcoin wallet on a laptop!!
**Twenty-five years in prison**
The naivete of some Internet folk truly astounds me: babes in the woods!

I have been on the case for over two months, spoken on the phone to 25 banks and credit unions. 
It's La La Land: disingenousness, ignorance, suspicion, flat-out lies.
Still trying to get any one bank to state publicly that they won't shut the accounts of crypto users -- but cm's news trumps my work. Well done.
But most importantly, guys: **the left hand doesn't know what the right hand is doing**. One part of a bank will be helpful; another part unhelpful. What we need is a public statement from a bank to the effect that they are 'Bitcoin neutral.'

Okay, Australians: Flash Report, as fast as I can type:
# several crypto-accepting businesses in Australia already have in place sophisticated accounting systems, in one case, including a sub-modality that deals with capital gains tax issues. The actual integration of cryptos into these businesses seems well well within the work-a-day competencies of the people involved.
# There is at least one legal firm that has an idea, and Indiamikezulu itself has an accoutant paying attention to developments. The ATO has promised a set of regulations by the end of this tax year.
# The Attorney General advises Aus Trac, which is the point-man authority on money laundering and counter terrorism. The A.G. thinks (it's in an Aus Trac doc.) that Bitcoin 'is issued by a commercial enterprise.' So, they have no idea. So, Aus Trac will have no idea.
# of the Big Four, what's apparent is that . . . they both have no idea, and they are not prepared to discuss the issue. I get 'directed' to a 'Media Spokesperson,' who has me email, then doesn't reply. One bank's position is a logical fallacy. Another's 'answer' wasn't related to the question I asked. 
# It's also apparent that there's no coherency within the corporations. In several cases -- I am now on Telephone Call Number Eight (over three weeks) with one bank -- what's clear is that 'my supervisor' tells the Banking Consultant 'Oh yeh mumble mumble really busy gotta meeting' and that's supposed to be enough. One example is: 'No one uses Bank XYZ accounts to facilitate the purchase of cryptographic currencies.'
Then it gets weird, 'cause you have to start explaining that (a) you have Internet reports exactly to the effect that Bank XYZ's accounts are being used to facilitate purchases, and (b) you have spoken at length to an exchange owner who has a good relationship with Internal Team X of the Bank XYZ, and (c) it's a logical fallacy -- given the nature of crypto-fiat trading -- to say that Bank XYZ's accounts aren't being used to facilitate purchases (which they don't understand because they don't understand the nature of cryptos).
The right hand doesn't know what the left hand is doing.
# One bank only -- shan't name it 'til I get a clearer position -- not only didn't treat me like an idiot, but PUT ME THROUGH TO A DIRECTOR OF THE BANK, with whom I had a half hour conversation. I showed him com-http.us, where there are almost 300 cryptos indexed. He was surprised, to say the least.
Conclusion: every crypto user in Australia should start ringing banks, and explaining that they are intending customers who wanna know what the bank's position is. 
Now consider this, guys: overall, banks stand to lose at the hands of cryptos. Meanwhile, though, if one bank steps up to the plate, it can rip a great deal of business from the other banks in the interim.
So, we seek out that bank, and we shift our accounts to it. Full stop.

Sorry, Georgetronica, you logic is simply wrong. Those who want 'a currency free from controls and easily sent anywhere abroad' include many who want to use Bitcoin in ordinary commercial situations, not in the libertarian sense. 
You have clearly never lived in a brutal authoritarian nation, in which to confront the Government -- by using Bitcoin in ordinary commercial situations -- could result in torture and death.

Thanks, itip. IndiaMikeZulu has been involved in GAW for a while. We hold Paycoin -- not because we like corporate coins but because we think we need to understand the phenomenon (which we think is gonna just get bigger)

Remittance by crypto explained by trade-union organisers.
I lived in Indonesia, which provides many female workers to Saudi Arabia. The degree of extortion that these (underpaid) workers suffer, as they carry their cash out of one authoritarian nation and into another, is just heartbreaking. 
So, the possibility of such workers eventually being able to shoot their earnings from android wallet in Saudi to android wallet in their home village is wonderful.
@_date: 2015-11-22 05:46:27
I came in just the opposite direction, underpaid: 30 years in libertarian politics, and took up cryptos when I came across them.
@_date: 2015-03-08 03:12:32
What annoys me is the logic implicit in the alts-are-parasites perspective: Bitcoin champions libertarian technology, but should have the authority to forbid any libertarian activity that competes with it.
I put up with **years** of this while working with Leninists: freedom, yes! But freedom under out control . . .

I have a great deal to learn here, but the general principle appeals. (Disclaimer: I hold CBX . . . 'cause the general principle appeals.)

I am not a computer guy, b. My background is revolutionist (‘devolutionist’) theory and practice – over thirty years. My politics are ‘centrist’; but I worked for a long time on the left, as a libertarian (for example, I did my political apprenticeship with anarcho-syndicalists and anarcha-feminists in the mid-80’s). 
This milieu is dominated by Marxists and Maoists, who treat Every Other Left Faction as elements to be marshalled and talked down to and Instructed in The Proper Path.
[Anecdote: unsatisfied with the you-know-nothing-‘til-you’ve-read-Pamphlet-Seven attitude of the ‘leading comrades,’ I spent three months in Perth’s Alexander Library, reading up on the Russian revolution, in order to hold my own at the annual ‘party school.’ 
{Don’t scoff. The year before I did Marxist transitionalist economics, which is a purty damn interesting block of work to have under your belt 20 years later, when reading discourses on Bitcoin-fiat ‘hybridism.’}
During that time, I returned again and again to the leading comrades, saying, ‘Nah! The data in the Pamphlets is tendentious and over-simplified’
Ultimate response? After 12 weeks of preparation? They just **banned me** from party school.]
Feel free to ask any other questions you like. I have long personal experience with ‘party communists’ – Stalinists, Marxist-Leninists, Trotskyists, Maoists – and their attitudes to controlling information.
P.s.: the last 25 years has seen the advent of quality academic data on ‘the nature/nurture thing’ – which the left got flat-out wrong, and the right misjudged in the first place. Having a solid background in this field (it’s politics . . . ) I see the cryptographic-currency phenomenon as a fascinating anthropological experiment in which ‘trustless’ technology and good actors and bad actors and ignorance about the role of trust in human society and pseudonymity have all been shoveled into the Internet cement-mixer.
