The seed-words are your pin, but instead of 4 digits, that are very easy to crack, there are 24 words. Take a dictionary, pick any page and any word, then ask your friend to try pick the same word without looking. And do that 24 times in a row, and your friend must guess the correct word in the correct order.

Nothing, but in May the reward for every block mined is halved

Why is this bad? It's a free market, who are we to say what others can and cannot do?

"When lightning won't work out". It's a stupid question. How the fuck does he knows it won't work out? It's working right now and keeps improving. Answering that troll is pointless. "If X won't work we go for Y. -WHEN Y won't work what will you do then????!!"

I actually got a 4x4 Bitcoin module system, so send me btc for 4X returns!

Tjena! Today I started to play around with LN, and in only a few hours I've done 20 times more transactions than I have done on mainnet for years! Jävla fantastiskt är det!

Hello Mr 3 random words, I think you confused Bitcoin with Bitcoin cash abc
@_date: 2018-03-20 14:13:11
Yeah we'll just have to agree to disagree. For me it's just the opposite, I've never understood why we 10 years later should rely on the same exact code. I guess that's why bitcoin cash have so few developers ;). 
I don't want my every coffee purchase to be forever registered in the blockchain. And I don't want 0 confirmations to be standard when I pay. I root for Bitcoin, and we'll see what tech that will outlast the other, but probably not today!
@_date: 2018-03-20 11:15:33
Yeah, maybe you should read upon it yourself, I'm a bit bias on it. Also read up on antbleed! Both are very interesting! But in short asicboost is patented by bitmain, and all their own miners use it, and gives them about 20% more efficiency mining using a loophole. Segwit patches this loophole, resulting in bitmain losing 20% mining capacity on Bitcoin. This is why they forked just before segwit was activated.

Sometimes it's "the original Bitcoin" and sometimes it's "just a year old".

Nope, what makes you think and say this?

If i open a LN channel to a friend and I fund it with 1 BTC, can we send BTC to eachother? Im still trying to figure out how the receive works on LN. From what I understand I need to spend some to then recive some, but how does that work at first if none of us can receive? I hope someone understands what Im trying to ask.
@_date: 2019-01-11 07:05:18
Yeah, CEO is just a title, he can't be held responsible for what the company do! /s
@_date: 2019-01-07 17:01:50
Aaah, thanks! So if it's just me and a friend, to send him BTC over LN we both need to fund a channel with each others? Won't work if we both only funded 2 other channels? 
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:37:28
To summarize:
BCH was created by bitmain to still have use of their patent: asicboost: "no comment"
Antbleed: "fake news"
And yes we would be in a bad spot if bitmain stops mining bitcoin, but they wont. Bitcoin have 478 contribiutors and 238 new commits in the last week. Bitcoin Cash have 3 contributors and 64 new commits in the last week. BCH have always only been on lifesupport.

Im 50% sure the price will go up!
@_date: 2019-01-11 07:35:26
What are you trying to say? That the CEO is the only one who did not know?
@_date: 2018-03-20 06:35:06
Yes, the problem was asicboost was going to be useless with segwit, and bitmain miners would no longer have the unfair advantage.

I really don't like that argument. If I get sick, should I study to be a doctor? If I need a car, should I study engineering and make one? Oops got hungry gotta become a farmer.

I like bitcoin and I'd like to use it also, but I'm not going all in. I have exposure and I don't want less nor more. I for one would use something like this, if it existed. I could buy Bitcoin every week for the amount I've spent, but price movements can be brutal. And it's to much of a hassle to buy every day manually.
