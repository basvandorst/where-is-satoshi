I didn't like the one in August. We knew it was coming and the confusion surrounding the fork... Mt.Gox probably worse though.

ETH has a bigger ROI, not ripple?
@_date: 2017-11-22 16:57:42
ETH showed a 3671.5% increase. That's larger than the 2950.4% increase that Ripple showed. Dash showed 5315% gain, so yeah, that's better...
