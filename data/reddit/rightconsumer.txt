Correlation does not equal causation.

Two steps must be taken.
* Match technical know-how with sufficient financing to build a financial tool that will provide low-cost currency hedging insurance to retailers who choose to accept Bitcoin. They will purchase monthly insurance contracts that will compensate them in the case of a massive dive in Bitcoin price. On the contrary, if the price significantly increases, the retailer will then pay the profits to the hedging insurance company.
* Again match technical know-how with sufficient financing to build a US-based Bitcoin trading and banking platform. The platform will operate much like a TD Ameritrade or E-Trade. It will enable consumers to have direct access to their accounts on US soil. Additionally, the company will need to have comprehensive compliance programs to abide by federal and state broker/dealer regulations and tax regulations. This will enable the company to interact with US banks, providing nearly instant liquidity of Bitcoins should a consumer choose to convert his or her coins to US currency.

This is very cool, but you're nuts man! Let's say I pay you $990K. You accept the money in your wallet and Bitcoin hits a bump in the road and drops 20%-30%. That's a $200K-$300K loss. I truly wish you the best, but you've got to have iron balls to go through with this.

Yeah totally, because some eccentric multi-millionaire all of a sudden decided he/she would drop $1M buying an unstable currency using one of the most over-priced and illiquid exchanges available. That makes perfect sense.
This group needs to admit that Bitcoin will someday be an awesome currency, but in the meantime, it's being driven by speculators and money launderers/drug dealers. All of this "To The Moon" BS only fans the fire. **The focus should be on gaining merchant acceptance by providing hedging vehicles so merchants don't take huge currency risk and providing a better way to liquid Bitcoins into any currency faster than waiting on an overseas bank in Slovenia.**

I like how everybody assumes that this is a speculator. Speculators wouldn't waste their time with Mt. Gox. Especially those with $1M in liquid assets to invest. That only leaves one possibility. Money launderer/drug dealer.

Not true. As a business owner, I am comfortable leaving my liquid worth in US Dollars because it is the most stable currency available. If I made a big sale and left my money in a speculative currency, I could lose or gain a huge percentage of my buying power overnight. Until someone comes up with a simple and effective mechanism for hedging Bitcoin, it will not catch on with retailers.
