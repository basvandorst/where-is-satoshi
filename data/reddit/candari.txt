If you use the coinbase mobile app to verify, you skip the picture part. The webcam part was being wonky, and this took care of it for me.

There are definitely delays in API calls when the market is going crazy. It is just small hiccups though, and any decently written alert program should be able to fire one off quickly once it gets a message that is above/below the trigger thresholds.

It will go up, until it goes down. And then at some point, when it stops going down... it will go up.

I find it amusing how the ad on this page is for an alternative investment to bitcoin because the price is going down. That campaign clearly outlived its relevance.

So heard an ad today for a mortgage lender where one of the things they listed as a good use for your loan would be to buy the btc dip. Clearly a wise plan.

Think of the wallet as the key to a safety deposit box on the block chain, not the box itself. Backing up the wallet is making a copy of the key to the location of your coins, not backing up the actual coins. As long as you have the keys, you can get to the goods.

Biggest drop in points, yes. Percentage wise, there has been worse.

It really depends on the trading strategy you use as well. If you just throw it all in on what you assume is a dip, you will hit a point where you guessed wrong, and either have to sell at a loss or hodl until the price comes back up.
If you plan on doing several small orders as it goes up and down and keep some capital in reserve to handle the dips, you have to take minimum order size into account. On GDAX it is currently .001 btc which is just under $11. Unless they changed it since i checked last. So $50 would limit you to only having 4 concurrent orders out at current minimum order size.
