But what is better: Taking a long time to recover all of your files, and giving the virus creator nothing, or paying the ransom, and help further the fraud? Besides, we have the hardware and software writers in the cryptocoin community to write an effective program that can use GPUs and ASICs, and by repeating this on many victims, we may find a pattern that will help everyone.

So wait, he's calling for "common-sense reforms to areas such as... law enforcement" days after his pet project kills a man? I mean, it's not the only space destined craft to be aborted this week, but it is the only one that committed involuntary manslaughter.

Interesting thought: if you used your freebie to decrypt a reasonably sized file, then grabbed a copy of the same encrypted file, couldn't you "mine" the key pair by creating a tool that generates key pairs, and then tests to see if when it encrypts, it creates a bit perfect match of the imprisoned file? From there, you can use the key pair to decrypt the entire drive.

I feel like they put that up just so their support stops getting messages asking if they will start accepting bitcoin. This just means or question has to change to "can you move up your bitcoin integration?"

It's great to see how so many of the cryptocurrencies are using their wealth to improve the world.
Though, if they were smart, they would be growing tree-borgs. You know, trees with computers inside them? Because then, they could mine while they grow. A forest that's *ALSO* a pool!

While I didn't read deeply into this linked article, it does remind me of another article I read recently from reddit. [This one]( is truly creepy... and could be used for stealing private keys. Or redirecting a miner to a new pool for someone else's gain. Or anything wild like that.

I'll give this a try: 1Hr2bSNmUZVDF4qZ643wXTyu1U97WiuPyE
Thanks a bunch.

From what I've seen here, the only businesses that are seeing heat for using bitcoin in the US are those that exchange USD for bitcoin, those that give away bitcoin to encourage use, or those selling tools to mine bitcoin. I'm willing to be wrong, if you have an article about how a company that was selling legal products/services for bitcoin, got shut down, you would be right that this may not work in the US.
In the long run, this was a thought experiment to build a working system for coin operated machines. I'm not convinced that it wouldn't be allowed, because there are no refunds, and you cannot get change back after paying in bitcoin. No exchange of currencies was made, so they do not need to register as a currency exchange.

I think that it may be a better idea for the time being to suggest to all merchants/traders (okay, maybe enforce is a better term) to round all transactions to four decimal points, as the current rate of USD to BTC even still makes 0.0001 BTC worth very little. As the price per bitcoin increases, we can start using extra decimal places. Just because we CAN divide a bitcoin to 8 places doesn't mean we HAVE TO.

That would work at places like Dave and Busters, where the card system was already in place, but for an arcade to switch to that method would be much more expensive. The purchase of card sliders to install in every machine, along with the constant cost of purchasing new cards would not be worth it most places. I was mentally designing a system where coins could still be used, but also be supplemented by bitcoin.

I was so bummed when this bundle came out, because I've been between jobs, and didn't have the money to spend, even on (cheap games/charity). But then again, I also learned about bitcoins during this time, and while it basically cost me my entire bitcoin wallet, I am happy to say that the system works, and I was able to give my standard, albeit humble, donation again. Thanks for accepting bitcoins!

The hacker brings down the site for a short amount of time. After, a small amount of people panic and sell their bitcoins, lowering the price. The hackers then buy bitcoins at the lower price that they made happen. They wait for the market to re-stabilize, then sell their bitcoins for a profit.
Rinse, repeat.
EDIT: Or, like I said before, I'm crazy and paranoid.

After seeing MtGox's post about the Layer 7 DDoS attack using more than just a flood of traffic to DDoS the site, and something more like semi-legitimate orders of non-value to flood the site, which makes it harder to prevent, might this be the "step 2" of DDoS'es on MtGox?
The first DDoS attacks seemed to include all those 0.0001 transactions, which if done quickly enough has it's intended result. MtGox probably realized this, and added code to prevent attacks like that from resulting in a DDoS, probably preventing rapid trades between people *multiple times between the same people*.
All of these transactions now seem to be in increments of -0.0001 BTC each time, which may get around any preventative system they implemented. They also seem to be happening quickly enough that this may be the start of another DDoS attack. I would bet that when the amount gets back down to around 0.0010, they will loop back around and continue so the attack can continue.
Obviously, the way for hackers to benefit from the bitcoin system is by attacks like this, and every time MtGox tries to deter them, they will make a slight change in their attack pattern to make it work. This is just the way it's going to be.
Or I may just be crazy and paranoid. Who knows?

I've been using a GTX 460 as well for about a month now, and have earned  about .13 BTC with it. You know, enough to donate to Humble Bundle, and that's about it. But I'm getting closer to 65 Mhash/s, 80 with some slight overclocking. I'm not sure I can give you a lot of advice, but I can tell you I'm running GUIminer on Win7 64x and I've been using the extra flag "--vectors" which did add about 1 Mhash/s to my rate. If I had to guess from your image, you're running Linux (Ubuntu)? Maybe look into the video card driver you're using.

You seem to be running under the impression that the machines would take bitcoins instead of quarters or tokens. My idea is to add bitcoin as a payment option, without getting rid of the option to pay in quarters or tokens. People with USD use a change machine to get quarters/tokens, that are then used in the machines, while people with bitcoin can transfer from their wallet to the machine they want to play directly.
I agree with you that if the arcade were to only use bitcoin, there could be issue getting those without bitcoin currency to play with. Your system may actually be acceptable, with the argument that "since these bitcoin can only be used here, it is very similar to a system where an arcade takes your USD and gives you tokens that are sized and weighted to work only on arcade machines in this arcade". I still feel the best way is to accept both, and for people without bitcoin, force them to use quarters/tokens.
