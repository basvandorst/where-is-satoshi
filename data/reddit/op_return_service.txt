Yes, I believe I started with that example also.  The other problem is actually pushing a txn, as most services block the use.

For Now, [Here](
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:53:36
Does that limit you to a txn with only one output?
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:37:27
What happened with yours?  Everything looks functional besides the first "Stamp" page.  I like the idea, and am familiar with your encoding method.
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:26:08
I meant, in regards to other outputs.  Ie, you can build a txn with multiple regular outputs, just one OP_Return.
@_date: 2015-02-02 14:53:04
As far as I know, you have to push it from your own node, and be of a certain software version.  Blockchain.info and others block OP_Return push txn's.  So like I said, this was to make it easy for the general user.

The current 0.0005BTC fee is used as follows:
 - 0.0001 - network fee to publish OP_Return txn
 - 0.0001 - Paid to To address
 - 0.0001 - Paid to From address
 - 0.0002 - Fee collected by op-return.com
@_date: 2015-02-02 01:46:51
This just allows anyone to link any two addresses to an OP_Return script.  Basically a way to "tag" addresses with a message/link.
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:42:23
I've just found OP_return difficult to learn, and wanted to make it easier for others to experiment with.
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:41:48
Sure, I'll work on a tool to let anyone do it.
@_date: 2015-02-02 23:49:05
Odd how other more popular block explorers all discard this transaction.
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:45:37
Why?  OP_Return is the "proper" way to do something like this.
@_date: 2015-02-01 23:57:47
Here's a service I created to tag transactions like this, and to provide a message between addresses.
@_date: 2015-02-02 02:08:51
Correct.  
Currently this setup is just to test the market to see what user features might be desired for OP_Return.  OP_Return is currently not an easy transaction to build for the layman.  This makes it easy.
@_date: 2015-02-02 21:00:35
I'm only putting 40 chr of OP_return data, the rest is a centralized database to op-return.com. 
Though you may be correct that some miners accept and process larger OP_return txn's
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:59:41
There is a chr limit on OP_Return, and you can only have one per txn.  It's just easier to spend to those addresses as a way to mark them.
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:44:14
Yes, you can embed more data in a variety of other methods.  I believe currently the largest way to inject data is via a custom MultiSig process.  
@_date: 2015-02-02 18:08:32
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:41:50
I would bet 75% of users don't realize this problem.
@_date: 2015-02-02 13:58:16
The difference is that I'm hosting a database that links to the OP_Return data, ie the need for centralization.  
But sure, use coinb.in for your own OP_Return, although its still a little complex for most users wanting to put non-Hex data in.
@_date: 2015-02-03 00:51:32
OP_Return already facilitates a method to further this objective.  No OP_Return in alt-coins.
@_date: 2015-02-02 00:26:58
A use example
 
@_date: 2015-02-03 13:16:58
Well, the cats out of the bag now.
