Actually lowtax feels very deeply about bitcoins
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:06:37
And from that point onwards the Dogecoiners control the bitcoin network. I like this plan!
@_date: 2014-07-18 17:27:34
Lol, they're not "negotiating" with they're simply letting you know how things will be.
@_date: 2014-03-14 21:32:15
I take it you've never heard of "dividends".

True, you can mitigate risk of the lottery by buying a shitload of tickets, which is essentially how mining pools work.
Wait, for some reason that does not sound very convincing either.

Hmm yes let's pretend that actively facilitating a crime should not be a crime in itself.

It turns out that regulating "math" is unnecessary when you can just throw the users in jail.
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:22:19
If your time is worthless this is true. Once you factor in the cost of mining and the time spent it's a negative sum game.

This really is the stupidest thing I've read in a while, and that's saying something since I read regularly.

How will you ever even see Szabo's review when it's covered in a deluge of "reviews" written by idiots? Cf. reader comments on news articles, Reddit.
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:15:15
You have no coding skills and don't understand how the blockchain works, and yet believe that "the blockchain technology will change the face of financial services for the course of my career"?
Sounds real smart.
@_date: 2014-07-15 11:40:03
I'm saying that Reddit is a giant echo chamber where any informed opinions are quickly buried in an endless pile of shit, and that's exactly what will happen to your decentralized non-peer review system too.

Hmm, more (or maybe less) freedom, homeschooling, public subsidies for private entities. Sounds fascinating but why is this important or desirable?

The actual cost of a single BTC to BTC transfer is around 40 USD at the moment, which is insanely expensive. Who would have thought that a decentralized system is also supremely inefficient?!

True in the sense that you couldn't buy anything with bitcoin in Ukraine before and you still can't.
@_date: 2014-06-06 18:20:26
That sounded pretty inane, so I had to google it up to learn the source. Was not disappointed.
@_date: 2014-03-31 16:15:57
how about not

I tried this approach last week but the old geezer I had picked as my target turned out to be John Nash and he just laughed at me :(

Good news, everybody! A party that has been around for 20 years and has never won a single seat endorses bitcoin!

Too bad most bitcoiners are libertarians/ancaps, so here we are.
@_date: 2014-07-21 20:49:30
They don't want their customers to pay with bitcoin, they're not idiots or ideologues. All they want is money. You get more money when you add a 6 euro transaction fee to the price.

I bet it really inspires trust in Bitcoin in the common people when they see one of these unidirectional "ATMs". A box that takes your money and gives you magic beans but won't take them back, sounds legit.
@_date: 2014-06-13 16:35:14
Yes, and it failed.

What do you think bitcoin faucets are for?
@_date: 2014-07-09 18:07:26
And that *uncertainty* alone is enough to make any infrastructure based on the current blockchain a clear no-no for every prudent investor.
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:46:46
No worries, when the subsidy goes down the majority of miners will probably form a cartel and unilaterally restore the subsidy. If a minority tries to stick to the original protocol, they'll just 51% attack the competing chain to oblivion.

It's the miners' average revenue in BTC times USD/BTC exchange rate, divided by the average number transaction over some time period.
Miners' revenue consists of transaction fees and the current block subsidy. Almost all of this goes directly into paying for the mining equipment and electricity. If the subsidy goes down, either the transaction fees go up, or the network hashrate collapses.
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:59:12
It sure does, that's why the price is constantly falling unless it's being actively pumped by hucksters.
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:59:43
Yeah, much like Silk Road users and exchanges involved in money laundering are safely beyond the reach of law. Check and mate, FBI.
