Bitshares decentralized exchange... the only way to trade safe from hackers IMHO.
Ironically, I personally lost 3 btc on bter today because I was selling BTS for MaidSafe. bter closed operations in 15 minutes after I deposited 80000 BTS into it.
Come on, people! let's do bitshares bitusd exchange liquid and never be hacked again :)

Attacker split 7000 into 7 times 1000. All the 1000s are in that addresses. 
That addresses are 100% thief's
If thief starts 'mixing' that money, they will be lost forever.
But WHY ON THE EARTH doesn't bitcoin support 'blacklisting' of 100% thief's address? 
I think there is NO technical reasoon for this to be impossible.
Could anyone explain, why it is impossible on moral or business side? Are there any bitcoin devs here?
So I think it's better to make this stolen money LOST FOREVER than giving hackers opportunity to drink whiskey prepared from our blood.
There could be some kind of voting on hackers transactions. Or at least bitcoin could prohibit doing single transactions of more than 100 btc in one single day.
So it could take a week to stole all the 7000 in the example above.
Also. There is 2 opportunity. 
1) Either bter are not too smart people that they had 7000 btc in ONE SINGLE wallet.
They could have 10 wallets with 700 in each. and they had money to hire 10 people to enter passwords 24*7.
2) or Bter intentionally stolen all the 7000 themselves. I don't like this version since Bter was good exchange until today in my opinion (that blue BTS robot-avatar for example). They had good BTS support.

well, banning is hard thing.
Maybe top limit on transaction size? For example not more than 10 btc at time. One transaction is 10 minutes at least (for 6 confirmations). So for 7000 btc it will take 7000 minutes = 100 hours = 4 days.
So even if they need 1 day to understand their money is stolen, they would have only about 2000 btc lost.
For ordinal people it is not a problem. I can afford clicking 10 times to buy a car for 100 btc.
I think it would be a nice feature. Just like banks do with 'day spend limit' with creditcards.
