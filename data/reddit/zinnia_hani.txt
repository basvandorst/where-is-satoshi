Thats why GDPR exists in the EU

All of us is doing that. You're just flagging yourself to that "system" by telling them openly that you own bitcoins. Anyway.

They would also remove your data if you ask them to.

This has nothing to do with worry. The purpose is to make transactions anonymously ; I just find it counterintuitive to use bitcoin for a transaction that is going to be registered and linked to your name anyway.  
Now don't take me wrong, I'm not telling you that it isn't cool to be able to pay more and more things with BTC.

Whats the point if you still give your passport and your passenger data is still registered in governments databases?
@_date: 2019-04-29 21:26:25
You're still not anonymous when you take a flight because you have to submit your passport.

Oh I read an article about you not so long ago. Looking forward to read the stories!
@_date: 2019-05-11 08:11:19
Haha yeah

lmao same react

pretty much. EUR already wanted to become a second reference currency when it was created. Now that blockchain exists and adoption becomes reality there are legitimate chances for a cryptocurrency to become one.

I wonder how many 1 BTC unique hodlers there are.
@_date: 2019-05-10 16:04:30
BTC :D

If you jumped early enough you could have invested 40$ and own 40 BTC. That has nothing to do with the number of $ you invested, but the number of BTC you own today.

Your ex is a bitch man. But I understand your decision. Your kid is everything and no amount of money will change that.
Still, you shouldn't give her everything. You need money to give your son the best future possible. Think about that.

Is there any reason why you recommend buying on coinbase? What about other exchanges?
@_date: 2019-05-03 11:25:19
There's always a risk of forgetting it when you need them. Not to mention the risks of accident. No you should always encrypt them somewhere.
@_date: 2019-05-10 15:13:34
wow sorry. Cryptocurrencies!
@_date: 2019-05-13 09:29:30
I +1 this

Yep, doesnt give the persons number but you can guess its below 1M anyway.
