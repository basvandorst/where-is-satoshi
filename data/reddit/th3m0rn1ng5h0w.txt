Satoshi (probably) mailed cash to set up the anonymous email, then registered the domain using that email.

Excellent information thank you.

The old guard has put a lot of time and resources into traditional finance, unless you are special it's unlikely you can have lucrative success.
Artificial intelligence companies, and CRISPR companies, experienced a pretty big pump and fall back to reality. Some hidden gems are probably out there in life extension companies and sea-steading companies. IMO those are all going to be valuable.

If (and big IF) they colluded they could do some bad things like censor transactions or reverse transactions, hurt credibility of BTC, but they wouldn’t destroy the Bitcoin Blockchain. Other miners would want to continue the “right” chain and get the reward.
It continues to be an experiment in motivating miners to do the right thing, but 10 years in and it appears to be working.
@_date: 2019-07-21 03:04:03
Interesting problem. Where did you find this paper?
@_date: 2019-07-30 02:57:38
You're asking if the price was fabricated? It is unlikely the powers at be were able to fake volume on exchanges all around the world. It's more likely the free market went through a cycle.

BCH is a minority fork and as a consequence it is a less secure cryptocurrency. BCH supporters will tell you they are doing great with a large user base, support from miners, and better fundamentals... but **hash rate cannot lie** like a person can. More miners work to earn BTC than BCH because they know the value. Decentralization and censorship resistance are the only innovation crypto offers. Sending digital tokens over the internet is not innovation. BCH has lower fees, but it is more centralized and less censorship resistant.
If BCH wants to pursue a vision it doesn't make them evil, but what creates anger in a lot of people is their marketing/propaganda bending the truth to say BCH is Bitcoin. Consensus exists for a reason, and BTC is Bitcoin. Instead of working on BCH I've seen too many posts focusing on trashing BTC, and blaming a worldwide conspiracy that Bitcoin was hijacked instead of the actual truth: more people see value in BTC.

I'm surprised no one has said "don't invest what you can't afford to lose". That is the obvious answer, but just for fun below is one of the first statements ever made about Bitcoin.
"As an amusing thought experiment, imagine that Bitcoin is successful and becomes the dominant payment system in use throughout the world.  Then the total value of the currency should be equal to the total value of all the wealth in the world. Current estimates of total worldwide household wealth that I have found range from $100 trillion to $300 trillion. With 20 million coins, that gives each coin a value of about $10 million. So the possibility of generating coins today with a few cents of compute time may be quite a good bet, with a payoff of something like 100 million to 1! Even if the odds of Bitcoin succeeding to this degree are slim, are they really 100 million to one against? Something to think about..."

@_date: 2019-07-21 17:34:58
I’d also like to know this. That 1 million number gets mentioned a lot but I’ve never seen anyone provide the actual addresses.
Another point is that Satoshi could have started mining again with brand new addresses, so 1 mil could be an underestimate.

You can acquire new bitcoin by mining it, a very hard thing to do. Or you could get someone to give you some, or buy some from an exchange. There are lots of exchanges out there.
What can you “do” with it? The same things people have always done with money. Spend it or keep it.
@_date: 2019-11-17 05:26:06
XVG Verge is Bitcoin. It’s what I started working on when I got into the space. A store of value AND a means of exchange.
@_date: 2019-11-14 03:52:37
The basic timeline matches up. But if you look into Ross his story is pretty much all out there. He was working at and eventually took over this bookstore full time during the Satoshi years. It's unlikely he was managing that (and his personal life drama) while creating and testing Bitcoin.
If you find good evidence let me know, I was also interested in this theory. The Satoshi quote "I've moved on to other things" makes me think it's always possible they did something after Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-11-21 21:35:55
Bitcoin has many implementations so Bitcoin Core is not the only one. Bitcoin Core however is by far the most popular that users choose.
Also there are many contributors to Bitcoin Core, not just one company.
@_date: 2019-11-22 19:01:22
The “price” of Bitcoin is hard to define, because there are many exchanges with many different currencies. That may be why you are seeing different prices.
Remember the price is really just the most recent buyer and seller connecting, it is constantly changing.
@_date: 2019-11-14 04:27:03
Those are all fair points.
We do know when the powers that be got his laptop from him it was unlocked. If Satoshi stuff was on there I imagine it would show when they combed through it and even read his diary. Possible he completely restarted after releasing Bitcoin I don't know...
The "official record" clearly withheld info. about the murder for hire stuff, so it's definitely possible more things they found were purposely omitted. The judge certainly had things on her mind aside from the listed charges...
@_date: 2019-11-18 00:16:49
Satoshi claims to have started working on it in 2007, if you take them at their word.

It’s interesting to think about. The issue is who gets to decide what improvements to make, who picks the date to start, who determines the mining algorithm? The term “immaculate conception” for Bitcoin gets thrown around as a joke, but it’s a pretty accurate description. Satoshi being this mysterious figure that came and went is impossible to replicate now that cryptocurrency has attention.
@_date: 2019-11-23 04:05:34
You're on r/Bitcoin so many on here dismiss altcoins. 
Altcoins might promise new innovations, but as it stands today there are more miners trying to get Bitcoin than any other project by far.

I wouldn’t fixate on having a “whole” bitcoin, especially if your financial situation is making you choose that over Christmas... It’s your life but viewing it as 100,000,000 satoshis instead of 1 bitcoin might be a healthier way to view the goal.

The Bitcoin blockchain might not list your name next to each address, but if you bought coins on Coinbase they can follow where the coins went.
It would take some work, but tax collection is a big part of any government.

After double checking you are right. Satoshi stopped posting in public in 2010, but they allegedly continued emailing with certain people. No guarantee that these people aren't making up the emails... Mike Hearn shared his last message from Satoshi dated 4/23/2011 that seems credible:
"I've moved on to other things.  It's in good hands with Gavin and everyone."

You can buy bitcoin on an exchange. If it’s a small amount some might recommend to just leave it on the exchange. If it’s a large amount some might recommend that you buy a hardware wallet. Just google search the top two hardware wallets and pick one of those.
