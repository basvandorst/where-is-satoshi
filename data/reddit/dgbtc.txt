Forget abt this the NEO page is showing absolutely wrong graph. 
I was taken aback
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:03:34
It definitely will and it should.
But at what point of time is the question. 
It is at this point that BTC would start serving as an alternate currency and stop serving like a speculative asset. 
Point is the whole world is realizing the potential of this turning out to be a alternative currency and is trying to have a part of it. This has been leading to increase its price
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:08:03
There would be many I repeat many times when some altcoin prices would keep increasing. 
One would be tempted to give up BTC and exchange it for that currency. We will keep thinking that yes I will buy this back as 1.5 BTC once I am satisfied with the price.
Dont do that. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:52:02
Thank god, I was worried only I was having this wrong feeling, good to know there are similar minds.
My sister was pissed that I was complaining that BTC is not moving despite it being at ATH levels now
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:17:48
I would not like and store/hodl a Bitcoin which is just worth 4$. 
This might in effect bring the price down as this will reduce the hodlers

The exchanges in India charge a lot just like how the OP mentioned..
But you can't buy from outside either as Indian central bank and credit card companies doesn't allow you to buy from exchanges outside India. 
And echancges like coinbase doesn't allow Indian members to join them.
It's a mess. If Indian you have to buy bitcoins at extra cost that Indian exchanges sell at an pray the BTC increases in price to make good for extra cost.

The winklewoss Bros should be one.
But we are not sure of Satoshi has cashed out or not.
@_date: 2017-08-13 11:50:21
Please dont tell me you are in India. Cos it doesnt work that way for India unfortunately
@_date: 2017-08-08 10:04:26
the challenge would be to differentiate yourself from thousands of videos, articles and material available online. 
Ask yourself what extra knowledge do you have that someone cant find by browsing online
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:06:37
Wasnt it discussed that posting this GIF brought prices down and people were requested to not post it further
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:45:17
I guess thats whats is happening now, people who are selling has reduced and people who are buying are waiting for it to drop.
Notice that the day volume (in USD terms) is almost the same immaterial of what the price is. 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:26:25
Thanks I faced brickbats fir saying that
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:39:19
I dont know why everyone quotes Google search correlation.
I checked and the data is wrong.. This is how it looks 
The search trend for now is lesser than what we saw at May end

It would be great to have some Korean / Japanese buy it. 
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:39:49
That's why I specifically said openly..
Cos for all we know he might have sold his shares or might have distributed it.. no point tracking him
@_date: 2017-08-15 04:08:28
ITT many Westerners guessing why Korea and Japan are buying BTC
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:40:31
I agree to most of the point except this
" The creation of bitcoin itself is causing global inflation to all fiat currencies. "
There are tons of other problem world is facing causing this inflation, Cryptos are hardly a drop in the ocean.

It is just some content decided to make some people happy. There is not much substantiation, no proof just some hearsay. poor reporting
@_date: 2017-08-11 06:50:58
I would be interested to know the number of transactions laid out against even other coins, like NEM, NEO etc.
According to me, even they should be having similar number of transactions, but its just the higher cost of BTc that is resulting in high visibility
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:32:26
Not me, as I mentioned, there were views posted earlier that this was a bad luck thingy.. so just pointed that out
@_date: 2017-08-12 19:44:54
You will be unfortunately downvoted by the community.
Imagine this, the same sentence has been said and listening atleast a million times. So you are not first nor is the message new.
You are correct. The way it's happening now can be equated to buying Amazon shares during the times of dotcom bubble..
It sounds surreal. And at some point the speculation will stop and stability will start..
The point is no one knows where is this point.

If you are in US, first create an account in Coinbase. The interface is simple and as good as buying in a ecom website. 
It is pretty self explanatory and would help tons of noobs. 
Once you make yourself comfy then you can get into the likes of Altcoins through something like Poloniex
@_date: 2017-08-11 07:05:52
For same reason why someone would buy Gold store of value. 
But you are right we have some demand from Dark web that has been fueling BTC price rise as well
@_date: 2017-08-14 07:41:12
Always in case of such examples try to look into something whihc is already a store of value.
Gold is now the ultimate Store of Value (for most people). But it is still being traded. It will be the same.

Coingratulations. 
Take a sabatical from your office (if you are stil working) and tour the world.
@_date: 2017-08-15 01:39:03
How much did they say they have?? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 11:45:26
The viewpoint that everyone is blindly buying BTC for the assumed intrinsic value of it
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:25:40
One can watch that in coinmarkercap
@_date: 2017-08-01 01:19:04
Dint coinomi credit equal amount of Bcash for your BTC?
@_date: 2017-08-08 19:56:13
I wonder if this is going to affect the  BTC prices at all. Given that BTC prices are already peaked up.
@_date: 2017-09-02 18:14:29
For all you know..
He may never have the balls to sell it with anticipation of even higher price.
That's the curse of BTC never knowing when to sell
@_date: 2017-10-19 14:25:20
Do you have a credit card.
Open an account with CEX.io
Get these balance credited to your credit card and spend it.

Before you judge me look at the comments I just left now.
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:36:46
If even half of it would happen. Things will be different..
Whats true is BTC has a long way to go. Lets see how things stack up
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:39:09
That's cos a vast number of people have adopted wait and watch strategy instead of doing any transaction.
Which has led to a reduced traffic.
@_date: 2017-07-31 02:02:44
Let me set the context straight for my question.
Earlier we were tracking the Aug 1 date because there was an anxiety among ppl like me worried that BTC might fork.(which I don't like but it's topic for a diff day).
But now that I know it's forking anyway I am less worried.
There is no point tracking the metrics like how we did on July 21.
That was my question should I track any metric of just go by the flow 
@_date: 2017-07-24 01:33:50
What if even people with wallets stop it because of fear and decide to wait and watch  
Let me add that to comment as well
