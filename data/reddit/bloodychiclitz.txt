Looks like the BCH network is handling this spam attack quite well.  The miners are mining larger blocks as needed.  tx fees are still very small, only a tiny fraction of BTC fees, and most transactions are still confirmed within the next block or two, so the backlog is not as great as the BTC network.

Yes.  And it's always better to get your news from multiple sources.  Read various points of view before deciding anything.

Or ETH, or BCH.  All others are faster and lower tx fees than BTC nowadays.

Not in all situations.  It looks like this was a tip jar at a casual fast-food place or coffee place, or something like that. In the US those are not the sort of "mandatory" tips like we have in restaurants, or when you get your haircut, etc.  If there is a tip jar at a coffee place or a take-out food place, many people do not tip at all, and if you leave $1 you're one of the better customers.  (Regarding restaurants where you sit and they wait on you at a table, tips are definitely expected, somewhere in the range of 15-25% or even higher for really good service. If you eat in a sit-down restaurant and you leave less than 15% as a tip, it should be for a specific reason, such as service bad enough that you needed to speak with management about it).

\&gt; Alternative method is to get external disc, go to a bitcoiner, or someone who has fast internet, install core there, he will copy to you the 150GB to your disc. At home you then copy the index and chainstate folders to your core, it then synchronizes quickly and you will be able to spend your funds.
I'm curious, why would he need to do all of that...?  Unless I'm missing something OP just wanted to receive bitcoins as payment; that's it.  Receiving bitcoins is super\-easy and does not require any complicated steps.  He can just use a mobile wallet, or open an account with Coinbase or Bitstamp or something like that.  If he's going to be getting big money, then he could get a Ledger Nano or another hardware wallet.

Key BTC Core developers with commit access such as Greg Maxwell, Peter Wuille, Adam Back and Luke-Jr are also founders and/or principals or key employees of Blockstream - even if Maxwell supposedly is stepping out and Luke Jr is a contractor.

You really do not understand the concept of a distributed ledger, do you?

Sounds like your friend does not now the definition of the term "ponzi scheme".  You really shouldn't waste your time &amp; energy on someone when they fail to understand the definition of the word that is the basis for the argument.

If it follows the historical pattern, this would be correct. However, if the current recovery continues, this would be much earlier in the cycle than the last one (2014 was much like 2018, but 2015 was a solid bear market all year long for BTC, while 2019 is showing signs of strengthening a full year before the next halvening...)
