Its rubbish.  I have my BTC on a SegWit wallet - Nano S.
I never normally move some, but I wanted to buy something else - Tx just stuck.  130 S/B but kind of expected it to move.
Maybe it will be moved by next xmas ;-)

Are you shorting at the moment?
@_date: 2018-03-30 12:01:57
Currently LONG - 11.5K, 9.5K and 9.1K.  Extended my stop numerous times and debating to quit, extend stop and/or add a short.  I believe it will rebound......but interest rates on the positions mount up :-/
@_date: 2018-03-29 14:26:21
My spread betting.... :-(  killer interest rates man!
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:04:39

Good luck!
