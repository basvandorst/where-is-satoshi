Anyone knows why is USDT so high today ?

There is obviously no proof I can have. I can show you seeds which will make me lose 100 hands, even then people will say its just variance. But look at their threads and chats, its full of people saying BJ is rigged(but most of them don't know the reason)

Ok, you can pay me 4.99 BTC then and I will buy it.

I am also on a similar boat. ADHD and found an immense interest in bitcoin and loved the community. Feel free to message if I can help with anything. Cheers!

So if you keep buying, when do you sell ?

I don't want to influence your choice, but expecting it to quadruple is expecting a little too much practically. 
But good luck!

I got exactly the coins from the [old block you were looking for !](

Yes, sending bitcoin to charity would be a much better option if I was to snooze an alarm. I would be totally up for buying one.

I wish they had the feature to anonymize the IP addresses somehow, for those download torrents.

I am sorry to ask this question here. I have money invested in bitcoin and is currently on coinbase as well. 
What could happen if a fork takes place ? 
Supposedly if 2 coins get formed, will I have an option to chose which to go with(assuming my coins are in my local system wallet) ?
Or will i get both ?

Congrats. Good to see kind opeople out there :)

Will be interesting to see how this roles out. Thanks for the reply.

Yes, I plan on storing it to my local wallet. But how would things be if a split happens ? 
Wouldn't it be a win-win because the main fork coin will still be around the same price, and having a second coin would also be of some value ?

If I wanted to spend 6$ every month , I would rather just use a seedbox or something . I am willing to spend the amount one time, but recurring charges is where I don't have much interest in.
