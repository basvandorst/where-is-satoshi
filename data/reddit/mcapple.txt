This probably has more to do with a built in wallet in their devices using RFID, etc than bitcoin.

Not sure what you're asking but found a good explanation someone else wrote online that may help.
"Transactions are not "stored" in a hash tree, but rather the proof-of-work that says a block is authentic is based on hashing the Merkle tree input of all the transactions. The Merkle root and a nonce (salt) is what miners are hashing to find a high-difficulty solution. Since the final Merkle root hash is always a 32 byte word size, this gives several desirable properties:
1. The Merkle root input is always the same small size, making it a consistent amount of work, easily transmittable for pooled mining, and simplifying writing hashing algorithms and the dataset size used in hardware.
2. The "shape" of the input data looks nothing like transactions, so if there was a preimage attack for SHA256, the obfuscating layers of hashing make it more impenetrable.
3. The Merkle tree gives several layers of checksumming that could be used to validate individual transactions, verify the tree, or verify the block.
4. Transactions are broken into blocks, and the previous block's hash is included in the current block, making a long strong blockchain of valid transactions.
It's not really much hashing, considering that you only need recalculate it once per new transaction a miner receives, and generating a block typically takes 5000 trillion hashes anyway."

A lot of those things can and do gain value just from the fact that people are willing to speculate on them. I guess what I meant was that for all practical purposes when "paper" currency has no worth short of for starting a fire there is no speculation and no real value either to keep it alive. Maybe you'd have it going on the exchange at a rate of 1 BTC = 1,000,000,000,000,000 USD but at the point you could argue that it essentially has no value, that trade is never going to happen, no one is going to bother lowering the price (they have no good reason to) etc. I understand and agree with what you're saying in a technical sense but I think that you'd agree at that point there is virtually no value (or very very very low negligible value) whatsoever to the fiat and that results in the fabled zero liquidity.
Personally I believe it's more likely to reach gold like prices rather than "zero liquidity", at least for the foreseeable future.

The day that regular fiat is worthless, BTC is accepted everywhere, and there is no point whatsoever to sell BTC for fiat is the day the price is an effective 0/Null. It makes no sense to sell so no one does so there is no exchange value anymore.

Bad idea. I can create a bot to make new accounts and have them mention bitcoins faster than you can say "apple bottom jeans"
Should be done manually to maintain quality and not have it all go to waste
EDIT: Not that I would make the bot, I'm not a dick. But someone else out there is a dick.

well, in the bitcoin white paper he talks about using a merklee tree
as far as I understood this means if the blockchain gets too large we can drop the really old info and keep chugging along fine using the not-ancient-but-old-enough transactions to verify the new ones

If you light your wallet full of cash on fire, does it still exist?
Bad news is its gone. Worse news is you can't backup a wallet with cash like a bitcoin wallet.
So what it comes down to is not being retarded.

One of the few moments I regret choosing this username.
Apples are not currently used a currency, they are not purchased nor held nor stored offshore for the purpose of tax evasion, they are not passed down from generation to generation, you can't buy a car with them, they are not subject to money laundering regulation.
Hence why it's a fucking dumb example.
@_date: 2013-06-10 08:05:07
There is only so much you can do to prevent it, it's a cat and mouse game. I doubt the amount of bitcoin going out would even be worth it but if someone was bored the point is it's more than possible to do. And all of these problem can be solved by just doing manual tipping. :)

If you look at other articles online you will see that the "skynet botnet guy" did a tiny ddos as a test for whatever reason well after all the big ddos activity had already happened with other botnets, he's definitely not responsible.

Banytoshbot is right, you're going to have to keep changing the date two be 2 months back to avoid locking out all the new blood to the site, so my bots just sit here silently and wait. You made a post threshold? They need to have a score threshold too? Awesome, thanks for giving me 2 months to get all of those posts ready in a plausible (non-automated looking) amount of time. As for the scores, gee I wish i had a bunch of accounts to upvote each other's comments, oh wait! I DO!

Exactly I agree. If you're going to come here and invest in this shit and then kill your own investment by regulating it to death then you don't know what the hell you're investing in or why it even appeals to people in the first place.
Sorry if I sound like a bitter old man but lord almighty these people with their regulation. I know bitcoin is the wild west right now and I like it damn it.
