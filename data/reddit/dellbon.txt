How is that different now with fiat? You do realise how much of the wealth is in the hands of the top 0.1%, right?
The cost of capital to compete in most industries is now so great that only large corporations can afford it. Growth makes them richer at the expense of everyone else as their competition is eliminated through increasing cost of entry.

No, we're waiting for technology to catch up and the market cap to increase to the point where it becomes a non volatile medium of exchange. We'll sell in exchange for goods and services, not fiat.

So apparently he called the crashed, knows what caused the crash, yet calls the panacea to the cause "evil"?
Sounds about right.

The US/Wall St isn't the only country participating in this game.
Rest assured that billions in fiat from all over are waiting to buy the dips.

The mere threat of a lawsuit forced Ver to make a raft of changes to bitcoin.com.
The lawsuit is all but guaranteed to proceed after that admission of guilt.
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:55:13
Sure thing. Completely random behaviour on Ver's part. No fear whatsoever. Clown.
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:33:56
And at 5k, 4k, 3k and 2k. "No one wants bitcoin no mo'."
This dump is China/Ver trying desperately to maintain the peg after the whack bitmain cash got from the lawsuit today.

[How bout dat](
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:31:02
Heard this at 6500 a couple weeks ago. Fudsticks need to change the record.
@_date: 2018-05-01 12:50:03
Uhuh, you're a daytrading chump who misses out when the price spikes 1k in minutes.
You keep doing you, champ...
@_date: 2018-06-11 17:07:40
Which stops retail investors coming back. Nice one.
@_date: 2018-06-08 07:44:44
What a cunt. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 15:45:38
It's not a currency.
@_date: 2017-11-10 23:28:30
No it won't. Bcash and s2x were rejected for wanting to turn bitcoin into a currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:52:29
That's some nice hodling
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:47:48
They're scum too.
@_date: 2018-03-26 13:15:39
how heavy are your bags?
@_date: 2018-03-30 18:02:25
I can't believe Chinese would do this.

Andreas is the worst of the bad actors.
@_date: 2018-03-26 12:18:40
There is nothing to understand. It's pseudoscientific horseshit particularly in the crypto space.
@_date: 2018-03-20 12:50:06
Fuck you and your bullshit strawman.

Poor form, Ledger.
You needed to be on this months ago.
Hire some programmers you cheap fucks.

Supporting the fork is not deciding which chain will have the BTC ticker based solely on the hashrate within 48hrs of said fork.

@_date: 2018-04-01 13:50:53
Give up, Jihan. You and your commie pals aren't getting bitcoin below 6500.
@_date: 2018-04-06 10:26:08
Andreas was confident that the opposite was going to be the case...

I hope you miss out.
@_date: 2018-04-01 16:46:06
In accordance with the scriptures.

Those two pricks are amongst the worst bad actors in the space.
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:04:12

All these new Redditors who've been in the game for years suddenly registering to tell us they've reached the end of their tether and selling.
@_date: 2018-04-06 11:48:53
If you're intent on selling the bottom, sure.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:52:10
Then fuck off.
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:08:29
I'd suggest you stop looking at coindesk because it hit 9760 on bfx and gdax
@_date: 2018-04-01 14:14:48
It's China.

Coinbase FOMO unravelling once again.
@_date: 2018-04-25 12:04:47
Money is pulled from the space every Christmas.
Futures is nothing. You want to know where the volatility for the past 6 months has been coming from? China and their attempt to resuscitate Bitmain Cash. They would have pulled the same PnD and BTC shitfork avalanche to reset the market regardless of the introduction of regulated futures.
@_date: 2018-04-17 12:04:10
I love the smell of rekt shorters in the morning.
It smells like...victory.
