It's actually really easy, just choose the right numbers every week.

[No, I'm not.](
@_date: 2014-02-25 21:53:06
Of course! It's all so simple!

I know, but De Beers haven't had a monopoly of the diamond industry in decades.

The good old finger of shame!

It's more like 4-5 companies.

If you have ever played hearts you learn quickly that shooting the moon doesn't always pay off.

I remember all the post about individuals who just lost virtually everything because they decided to invest when bitcoin was between 800-900.
@_date: 2014-03-22 08:29:12
Or how little he makes if it goes down. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 07:30:59
Or better yet an extension cord to your neighbor. 
@_date: 2014-01-14 20:44:26
And if you don't completely kill bitcoin, just rinse and repeat.

I think if you bought every winning lotto ticket for the past year you would come out ahead.

Probably the same reason why I don't make my own whiskey, too much time and effort when I can buy a superior product for less. 
@_date: 2015-04-07 06:43:09
That's why when I'm asked for a random number I always go with "one". 
@_date: 2013-04-10 22:33:01
The trick is called an extension cord into your neighbors garage!

[Because it's not like you can just create smaller denomination coins]( Truth is there is nothing stopping countries from making coins that are 1/n in value. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:07:07
What about the problem that bitcoins being deflationary don't really work well for actual banking?
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:12:44
Déjà vu
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:08:44
Ouch...  
  
Just to be clear I'm not a financial adviser, but if your whole life savings is Bitcoin at the moment I'd highly recommend moving at least a decent amount out of bitcoin for it could be a long time for it to recover (if it does), and the risk might just not be worth it.

Don't buy into this bubble, the rate of growth is not sustainable.
@_date: 2013-04-02 02:43:28
The important question is, was it any good? 
@_date: 2013-04-05 19:11:17
1. Don't use bitcoins  
  
2. ?  
  
3. Profit!
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:09:30
It has had two very big crashes in the past, and honestly it looks like we're approaching a third, but who really knows. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:29:33
As someone that is purely watching Bitcoin from the sidelines I got to say props to you for returning the coins. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 04:45:13
[Crazy how small the last peak looked before the previous crash.]( Really wondering how this one will end. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 07:11:13
Also McDonalds try's to avoid putting too many stores close to each other to prevent excessive cannibalization of profits.
@_date: 2013-04-11 22:30:43
I thought exponential growth was always sustainable!
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:03:32
Depends on how much you invested. 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:05:43
Crash, Correction, Panic, or what ever. The only thing that really matters at this time is that the price is dropping pretty rapidly, and hopefully not too many people are overly invested.
