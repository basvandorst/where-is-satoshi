False. They even admit still a rumor in the piece.
Google has signed a deal to buy game-livestreaming firm Twitch for $1 billion, *confirmed sources familiar with the matter*.
Unnamed sources. Not real, until it is _real_.

So you are saying we should have 4chan find Tom? ;)
@_date: 2014-08-03 07:17:10
We technically don't.

I forgot that movie even existed. For that, I shall watch it this eve!

Learn to read?!? The article says it was a scoop a full two weeks before it happens. As in, it isn't live yet?
I expected FAR BETTER from YOU of all people because I liked your site but shit, you've lost a reader. If you couldn't take the time to read this before opening your trap then how can I trust your shit moving forward?
@_date: 2014-09-26 05:28:06
Also curious.
@_date: 2014-08-18 20:16:36
It kind of sucks that people with a weak hand see a sale that is actually not a bad thing and are just like... I'm out.
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:49:05
What if the same people who own the hosting company also own UpDown? What if they are linked to Exante? Oh shit.
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:31:10
Or they got his laptop.
Although the most likely outcome was a lawyer called him and he was like OH SHIT.

Yeah - but he has a pretty vast audience. Perhaps just a few of those people will give BTC a try.

I don't know man. I just went to Google and searched for some of those transactions. They would be considered for tax purposes and I very quickly came up with this:
Apparently those are records kept for tax purposes. Published free and in the clear on the interwebs.
So it would seem he was telling the truth as those are considered tax documents, not in the sense of like a tax return but something that is kept track of for tax reasons.
The scary part to me though is that the document clearly shows a GOVERNMENT is keeping track of bitcoin transactions.
EDIT: Why no one is outraged by the fact that a government is keeping track of bitcoin transactions with names - I am unsure.

RemindMe! 11 days "New whistleblower scared by this whole thing and doesn't release anything"

No, you do realize he said he was selling them off today. Right? Like he posted a blog stating that.
I don't think it is FUD when the dude stated a fact, THE head guy for Ethereum guy himself said TODAY, he would be SELLING the coins.
I don't think the guy who left that comment said they are to blame for making the price go down but rather the panic sell prompted by weak hands seeing that many coins suddenly being sold.
Those coins have been sold bro. Read it yourself. Over on the Ethereum blog.
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:43:46
Sort of seems like that is EXACTLY what he did. He emailed them asking for a story and got an email back saying pay for it.
Don't mince words here CCN guys. You are doing this and keep being caught for it over and over it.

I guess if the site is pumping something we all overlook the obvious scam pumping they are doing? We need to self-regulate now. Stop upvoting garbage from garbage scammers.

Outside of the journalists who have been doing some of the best reporting in our industry.

Vik, given the nature of the vanishing posts on hashtalk I can't believe anything you just said.
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:18:03
Google doesn't own Twitch.... yet.

I'm just going to leave this here:

They were definitely the BFL documents.
A lot of people ate words over that whole situation. He really proved himself on that one. He had previous statements that had been verified as fact but that one really sealed the deal for a lot of people.
I know it was before they were online. I think even some mainstream reporters were talking about it when it happened.
It was a really big deal for people in bitcoin.
It was for sure before they were public. It caused a bit of a stir.
@_date: 2015-01-20 21:40:40
Keirns didn't publish his letter though. Coin fire clearly had the letters. They said it was the second round of letters that had gone out. I am inclined to believe.
I am one of the people who remembers the pictures mike tweeted about bfl. They were legit. He got trolled really hard and then a few days later people apologized when they saw the exact letters on the ftc site. He didn't redact them and rumor has it someone got fired for leaking it to him.

You do understand that you are sending people to a site that supports a well known scam and we as a community are sick and tired of this.
We are standing up to it. Stop linking to sites that are promoting the Paycoin scam.
