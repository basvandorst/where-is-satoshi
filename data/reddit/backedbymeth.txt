Nobody knows who he is. I barely know what he does ("spreads the good word"?).
From Letterman's faq, but relevant imo:  


The best way for a "regular" person to get on the show is to spend years becoming a fabulously successful actor, musician, athlete, or other kind of beloved celebrity.
"Human interest" guests fall basically into two categories: topical, and people with unusual hobbies, talents, or obsessions.

Shrinking from the cold hand of death,  
I too shall gather up my feet,  
Shall soon resign this fleeting breath,  
And die, my fathers’ Blockchain to meet.  
Numbered among Thy people, I  
Expect with joy Thy face to see;  
Because Thou didst for sinners die,  
Satoshi, in death remember me.  
O that without a lingering groan  
I may the welcome word receive,  
My body with my charge lay down,  
And cease at once to work and live! Amen.

 except your butt.
@_date: 2015-03-20 20:17:09
Hardware: how do you know what's *actually* in a Trezor?  
Software: has the source code been audited?  
Do you compile it yourself?  
Do you compile it from an audited version, making sure that nothing has changed?  
Eww humans: how much do you know about the people making it?
@_date: 2015-03-22 21:58:24
Oh Lord, how may we please you today? Will a buttcoiner sacrifice please You?
@_date: 2015-03-25 23:41:52
I meant full/regular/whatever clients. With the blockchain and everything.

Please call Andreas by his proper name: God.

Glue and scissors.  
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:39:52
Why would someone recommend centralized security? Unless you have the source code for it **and know** that the firmware is made from it without changes you have no idea what they put in it.
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:41:54
Blind trust? Why not just say "keep your fingers crossed"?
@_date: 2015-03-20 20:51:20
If you want to pretend it's Fort Knox*1000 then go ahead, but it isn't nice to fool other people.  
Maybe accept that you'll have to trust the people behind Trezor instead of digging your heels in.

There can only be one blockchain, all others are fake.
@_date: 2015-03-21 00:45:42
Exactly! Either you've got something that you "know" is secure (the regular Bitcoin client) or something that you'll have to trust (exchanges, Trezor).  I wouldn't trust a Trezor but I'm not gonna bother people about *that*, it's getting trust and knowledge mixed up and saying that it's secure basically "because I trust it".
