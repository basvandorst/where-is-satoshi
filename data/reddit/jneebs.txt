How would you convince the average person that being paid in Bitcoin was worthwhile? (Imagine you're not preaching to the choir)

One man... one zipper... The fast paced world of Bitcoin. (insert cheesy 80's porn music here)... "I was just looking for a few extra bucks... But now I've humped my way to the top..." This summer be ready for the X-rated underdog film of the year... "Zipperz 1: From Doge Style To Bitcoin Billionaire."

It's a hypothetical questions. It's basically the "If you wont lottery..." question but with Bitcoin instead of a magic golden ticket. So tell me p-o-t-a-t-o what would you do?

Where abouts in the world would you do this?

How would you go about it? a classroom setting? Seminars? Town meetings? Word of mouth?

Top Reddit Questions:
We all now need proof of solvency. How are they doing this? What steps are they taking to proove they have what they say they have
Ask them how well Cryptos are being accepted over there. Are the people expressing strong interest in adoption? Thanks!
Ask them about their banking relations. Who specifically do they bank with and do they have an opinion about the long term viability of the arrangement?
Also find out whether they will go to the effort of obtaining a money changing license in Hong Kong (like 796.com did - but subsequently lost it). If not, why not?
Does it bother ANX that other companies are marketing themselves as being Hong Kong exchanges when they have very little to do with Hong Kong (e.g. 796 is run out of Shenzhen, China; Bitfinex is basically run remotely by some European dudes). Is this an opportunity for ANX, something to work with in terms of their branding?

What software do they use for version control?
Very important: Can you ask them if they like tacos? (digital, pink and food)

Good question! I can't say for certain at the moment but if it's similar to their trading platform it won't break your wallet. 
Edit: I'm sure they'll see this tomorrow during their business hours and can get back to you. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 17:01:25
Howdy! If any of you want to learn a bit about ANX I was able to have a sit down interview with their C.O.O.! Here's a link to the interview: 
They were all lovely people !

I asked them if I could create a blog post on my visit there and they told me they don't see why not but they had to ask management first. It's still over a month away though too.
@_date: 2014-06-04 06:14:58
Sounds plausible and interesting!

It was mid afternoon in quaint town nestled between the cyan shaded ocean and the lush green of the Okinawa mountains when I happened upon this post. Being a fan of success stories I spied the title hoping for a story to inspire. Then, in the millisecond before my forefinger was forced down upon the mouse, I saw the posters name... "Slutlord-Facist". It's a strong name demanding respect from sluts around the globe. T left the post much how I had found it though I left a little note. A note to tell OP best of luck ... and thanks for the interesting username. To the moon you fascist slutlorld you

I dunno yet. lol I just signed up a few days ago. So far I've collected 30800 satoshi but there's only a pay out once a week I guess. I've been using microwallet on other faucets and they have always paid out after I reached the limit. 
@_date: 2015-03-20 06:07:24
can i resubmit it without the referral link?
@_date: 2015-03-20 05:40:01
I just found this a few days ago so I haven't had a pay out yet but so far it's kind of fun. Has anyone else had a payout?
@_date: 2015-03-20 13:49:00
They just had a payment and it worked!
@_date: 2015-02-06 05:09:06
This is an awesome idea! Good work!
