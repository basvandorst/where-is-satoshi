i got mine a while ago but only just started to use it 
its pretty cool
when im at restaraunts and the dudes take my card to swipe the eftpos machine with it they look at it and ask some questions so its a good time for me to preach about bitcoin
the only downfall is it doesnt have a paypass function so you have to swipe and you cant change the pin number so i have to rememer a new number and sometimes i put in my bank accounts number just because i day dream 
but other then that its great
just didnt know about the fees 
you guys should get one 
cheers for the help

Over the credit card network 
So were just buying prepaid credit cards with bitcoin 
Won't there still be a fee from the eft transaction on the store side
Then a fee to convert our btc to fiat to do the transaction 
Then a btc transaction fee
I think this is going to be taking one step back in why we will all go from fiat to btc 
But then again one step forward for making btc easier to use..
But unless we get paid in btc there is no point as really what were doing is buying btc and selling them back to this xapo guy ???

So people have to buy a dedicated card reader for the POS with bitcoin software or can they use existing.. I'm guessing there would have to be a software change on pos so there would be cash function eftpos and then bitcoin? 
I don't see this taking off when buying a tablet for store would be easier... And cheaper and Everyone has a smart phone... Just scan there code...

yeah i was going to get really good looking dog harness's 
pet stores usually have very basic ones
thinking like call of duty style and studded vests ect 
be sick 
but not getting much feedback 
maybe bitcoin owers dont have pets
I host about 1014 to 1015 microbes in and on my body (This compares to only 1013 cells of human nature in my body).
No need for a cat.
do you live alone?
pets are great companions

Does anyone know if just confirming transactions needs the same hash power as mining?
Because if jet only needs a small amount someone could just make an app or wallet that confirms 
@_date: 2014-07-09 12:06:39
oh this sounds like a good idea for a wallet ap 
when people start using BTC for city shopping they can see were they spent there btc 
good idea mate

App is okay.
would be alot better if you could scan an adress
then nick name it and add it to a adress book
instead of just being on the camera with the last scan on the bottom..
unless there is more to the app i cant find??
