They also happen to be Filipino, who generally are an amiable and cheerful lot. 
Except for some depressed would-be millionaires. :(

Hey MGK
@_date: 2015-12-23 02:42:55
Yes, you can barely get free flights in first class with an American passport these days.

You're on Reddit instead of having sex on that buttery countertop. 
What is *wrong* with you man?
@_date: 2014-04-04 08:12:10
For some reason I have a hard spot in my pants for Radio Shack &gt;:)
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:44:40
He could also could have started as a billionaire....
@_date: 2014-03-29 01:43:04
You're hired.
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:57:27
Ok! Thank you for your reply. I retract any statements made pertaining to your sexual history.
You live in Japan? 
@_date: 2014-03-14 02:00:58
Those lips have done some serious lying.
@_date: 2014-03-28 00:07:27
There's wealth, and then there's power. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 12:04:09
Screenshots please.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:19:12
A few tears. She made a giant neon sign pointing towards that old man's house saying: 'THIS GUY IS WORTH A BILLION DOLLARS!' Incredible.
@_date: 2014-03-31 07:49:08
That's how you pronounce it! 
Bit-fine-ex is absolutely retarded. It's Bitfinex. Not Bitfine-X.
@_date: 2014-05-22 06:52:25
You ask this, just a mere number of hours after the news of a **$4.5 BILLION DIVORCE.** 
You know what, give her all of it now. You're an idiot for asking this.

VoS was my first exchange and my favourite. I hope that they reach No  I tell all my friends to go there. If there were bumper stickers, I'd use 'em!
@_date: 2014-08-03 05:38:34
Almost as if the Yakuza don't know torture to get information.
@_date: 2014-04-17 13:57:28
Whoa whoa what? What real estate collapse? 
Layman here. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:43:49
That's actually good news, bro.
@_date: 2014-03-07 19:24:46
Why wouldn't she be? She pointed the lens of the world towards an old man and said that he was a billionaire. Even bush-league criminal organizations wouldn't bat an eyelash at making a beeline there. If anything happens to him or his family, then the shit really will hit the fan. 
She knows that she's finished; she opened a Pandora's box that has ended her career.
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:54:37
A billionaire who becomes a millionaire is self made.

BITCOIN IS MY FAMILY
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:48:07
I want to be more pro-active into increasing BTC adoption in my community but I don't know where to start. Can anyone point me in the right direction? 
@_date: 2014-01-04 01:56:00
NICE TRY SEALANDER
@_date: 2014-03-28 11:10:22
Should be. I was the winner of hit show 'So You Think You Can Pedant'.
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:36:13
And other cryptos? Seeing as BTC is the poster boy for this, once it is dead, public trust and awareness of BTC and by association all the other coins will be destroyed, and public acceptance is will be hampered for the others and may hinder their growth to the point of death.
@_date: 2014-03-29 01:38:42
If I could afford to party
@_date: 2014-05-06 12:45:06
very nice. however I'd be very impressed if you could pull off the same thing with the charts in Poloniex;
@_date: 2014-02-13 22:59:11
Thats hilarious
@_date: 2014-03-10 03:09:19
YA DON'T SAY
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:43:05
Have you/would you? I hear that it is impossible to withdraw at this point in time. So if you're in gox, you're in until the bitter end or bounce back into regular pricing.
@_date: 2014-03-22 17:50:12
how much would you pay in Cali?
@_date: 2014-02-17 07:32:42
I asked about Bitcoin, not the answer from every potential sex partner you might have had.
@_date: 2014-03-31 14:34:55
I am Canadian, so it's not like we're got a vast cultural divide :) 
@_date: 2014-03-28 08:45:38
Yeah, they aren't even good at day, either!
@_date: 2014-04-09 17:41:42
"Waaaaaait a hot minute here! These ladyboys were supposed to be *cheap*!"
@_date: 2014-03-17 20:04:52
She's pretty much Erin at this point. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 10:51:21
You seem quite sure, the other exchanges prices seem to be following suit...
@_date: 2016-03-25 18:45:38
If it helps, they're on the subreddit. 
It would be ridiculous to think that they weren't.
@_date: 2016-03-25 18:46:04
We're also not 4chan. Other people are invested in this guy getting his money back.
@_date: 2016-03-25 19:55:11
Yes, they're reading I'm sure. 
Not good business for them if they aren't on point.
@_date: 2019-02-25 02:06:38


People already have committed suicide.
@_date: 2019-12-08 06:47:46


It’s the  form of payment used in drug trafficking and sex slavery.

I'm glad that it's worked out for you guys.
Interestingly, Bitcoin helped *cause* my depression.
Long story short, started a GPU farm, ran it for a couple months mining coins, trading etc.
Depression hit once again, let it all stagnate, lost a lot, morale completely gone. This in addition to a host of other troubles led me to my second suicide attempt last year. 
It's been a long road to recovery, and I haven't been able to bear to look at my wallets, and I have a ton of graphics cards, mostly 280x's just lying around here. 
It's hard to get going with crypto when getting out of bed is a monumental task.
@_date: 2015-11-27 11:23:34
Mined for a couple months before ASICS. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 00:52:55
Oh I've got everything. Gold psus, risers, mobos etc
@_date: 2017-07-11 16:52:45
I've got a ton of 280x's that I've barely used for mining as I got hit with severe depression.
Now I'm just sitting on them. Are they good enough to mine with?

Instructables: How To Take Care of Your Tree Of Liberty
1. Plant in good, well-draining soil. Add vermiculite if needed.
2. Water often, ensuring the roots are soaked. Rewater when the soil is dry two inches deep.
3. On occasion, you may want to refresh your tree with the blood of patriots and tyrants.

Oh I'm an experienced miner, just got sick
