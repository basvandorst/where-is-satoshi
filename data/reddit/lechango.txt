Depends on how bad it is, if it's really worse than 2008 then that probably means banks shut down, that means no one can buy bitcoin because their fiat is in limbo. People will need cash to buy food and necessities, so they'll either try and sell their BTC off for cash or use it to buy the necessities (if someone is willing to take it).

Welcome to Bitcoin. You shouldn't have to wait to send any transaction for free, but a 1 satoshi transaction with no miner fee will be ignored by miners for eternity, so it would never confirm anyway.

You can likely convert the python script on the second reply on this page to TI-BASIC: 
Not sure if you're also interested in generating wallet addresses from the public key, I believe this is a bit more involved. Someone has already written a script for a TI-89 that will do it all from generating a privkey from dice rolls to hashing out a wallet address:  The link to the source code is listed under the video, you can audit it or create your own based off of it if you like.

I think Satoshi's private keys may have been lost with the death of Dave Kleiman. 
For privacy reasons, I won't disclose his name, but I recently attended a training course and the instructor had met both Craig and Dave on multiple occasions. In his opinion, Craig/Dave likely did create Bitcoin. He said that Dave always carried around a flash drive that he guarded with his life. That drive could have contained the keys to the early blocks, and I'm sure it was encrypted with a password that only he knew.
Now it's possible that he split the keys with Craig, so Craig may actually have control of some of the keys for the first blocks, but maybe not the 1st block.
If Craig does have the keys to say block 3 or 4, he knows that he could provide proof of that, but then the skeptics would demand a signature of the first block, which he could not provide.

No, you don't have to compromise, that's just what they want you to believe. If all of a sudden millions of users started using [insert preferred altcoin], it would have no issues handling the load (assuming it had the capacity to begin with, which many alts do).
Netflix is a great service, I use it all the time because it is convenient. BitTorrent isn't a service, however, it is a protocol, like BTC. It also benefits from more users, the more people that act as nodes, the better it functions. This is because it is not artificially repressed, there's no torrent trackers that say "Hey, only 10 seeders max".

Don't think you'll find anywhere to purchase that amount with a debit card alone. The only ways are going to be either local with cash (high fees), ATM with cash (also high fees), or ACH or wire transfer to an exchange like Bitfinex or Bitstamp.
Another cash option is Libertyx, I believe the limit is $1000 a week per account, so you'd need to spread it out over multiple weeks, or have multiple phone numbers to create multiple accounts. Libertyx may actually be cheaper than transferring to an exchange as you won't have to pay trading fees or wire fees, and they offer pretty good exchange rates.

This is a good comparison, however Uber offers a good service that can scale without issue. Bitcoin is a great pioneer for cryptocurrency, but the path it is going down will either lead to "success" by those funding Blockstream who aim to turn it into a controllable and centralized system that they can then sell as a "solution" to large financial institutions, or it will simply die off and be replaced by newer technologies that are willing to offer truly decentralized and expandable blockchains.

Cheapest way will be to wire to an exchange, if you are in the US Bitfinex is probably your best bet for liquidity. What's nice about wiring to an exchange, is when it hits they will credit you fiat, not BTC, so you can then buy at the current price instead of using Coinbase, making a $30K order, and hoping it doesn't either get cancelled or risk there being a big price dip while you are waiting for it to clear you bank.

Basically a private key is just a random number, you can use dice, flip coins, or any other number of manual ways to generate a private key. 
Here's a site that explains how to generate with dice: 
Now generating the public key from the private key is a little more involved. I'm sure it's possible to do with a calculator and some time, but there are open source scripts that have been verified to be safe that will do this for you.

Right, I also believe blockchain technology and cryptocurrency is unstoppable, but I'm starting to lean more towards the possibility that Bitcoin is not the future of cryptocurrency, we still don't have a good solution to allow the payment network to scale, and I fear it's too late now, even if the perfect hardfork was already completely written (which it's not).
BTC was the first, and up until now it's done a great job doing what it's supposed to do, but it looks like it's time to pass the torch to another network that can handle the transaction volume without heavy fee competition.

If you want leverage and liquidity and no trading fees, you'll want to go over to one of the big Chinese exhanges. The big downside to these exhanges is the spotty connection at times, sometimes the front end sites just refuse to load, and even the APIs are spotty at time.
If you are just interested in no margin trading on a reliable platform, I'd say Coinbase exchange is the smoothest and likely most secure platform right now, and has the most liquidity of any regulated exchange.
Bitstamp has a good reputation, but the fees are high and the liquidity is awful. Bitfinex has the most volume as far as Western exhanges go and decent fees, however they have been known to flash crash/spike due to margin cascades. 
If you want anonymity, btc-e is the way to go. People can call them shady all they want, but they've probably been the most reliable exchange overall.
@_date: 2015-06-04 06:04:44
Normally anything under $10K you don't have to report anything, so shouldn't raise any red flags. However, if you normally use Coinbase/Circle and you've never bought any amount over $1k at a time, they may cancel your order just on suspicion that it's not you placing it. 
Also, do you have a plan to cash it out once you get there? You definitely don't want to use an ATM, that'll incur a pretty hefty fee most likely. You can try localbitcoins, if you'll be near Tokyo I've heard most young people speak English, so if you don't know Japanese you could likely still find a buyer. 
Also, beware, the Yen is having a real tough time right now, the dollar is absolutely killing it in Forex markets right now, if I were you I'd probably hold onto dollars as long as you can while you are there, maybe use bitcoin as a tool to exchange for Yen when needed if you can find a good way to sell it.

My advice would be to hold onto as much USD for as long as possible, if you want my honest opinion I see both Bitcoin and JPY not doing so well in USD terms for the foreseeable short to mid term. 
I just looked up ATMs in Tokyo on  and it looks like some have a 5% fee which isn't really too bad. In comparison, JPY lost about 2.5% of it's value against the dollar just this week, so do the math accordingly if, and most likely, the trend continues in the USD/JPY market.

Hi there,
Electrum is a very good wallet. But keep in mind coins stored locally on your computer are only as secure as your computer is. There are many targeted viruses that will not even be flagged by AV software that could potentially steal your coins.
If you are only planning on keeping a small amount in Electrum, and can deal with the risk of infection or hackers, then it should be fine for your purposes.
The safest way to store coin is offline on paper, or on a device isolated from the internet, or something that is made to be as secure as possible like a Trezor. 
All you need to do in order to store your coins on paper is generate a key pair, this is two strings of numbers, one that allows coins to be sent to it, and one that is private and allows you to import your balance in full to any wallet that supports private key importing. The easiest way to make a paper wallet is on bitaddress.org, their code is open source and has been verified to be safe. If you want to take an extra precaution you can save their website and open it up on a computer (preferably linux) that is not connected to the internet, this ensures that no current infection will be able to steal this information when you generate your paper wallet.
As far as earning coin, there's options like or apps like Lawnmower. I'm sure there are some sketchy survey sites that will pay you out in coin as well.

Congrats on the find, this is big for you. Instead of wasting the time to update the newest BitcoinQT with the whole blockchain (50+ GB), you'd be better off importing your private keys into a wallet like Mycellium or Coinkite so you can have instant access to your coins. 
But since this is such a large amount, for now I'd just make sure you have your private keys, and contact Secondmarket, they should be able to take them all off your hands.
Also I'd probably look into speaking with a tax lawyer that has experience with digital currency, with an amount of this size you're definitely going to have to pay some pretty hefty taxes, but you'll still come out with quite a bit of cash. 
Edit: Also, at the moment, on Bitfinex (who just by the way made their reserves transparent) there's only about $3 of slippage to sell 3000 coins, from there you could just wire the USD to your bank account. But like I said, prepare to do due diligence with capital gains taxes.

Well currently it costs the most efficient miners in China about 550 CNY (less than $100) to mine a coin. I feel this may be a sort of base price assuming difficulty stays somewhat stable as it has been. Of course with the current state of BTC and its inability to scale, this needs to be fixed before I will buy any more to hold onto.
Note, I still love to utilize BTC as a currency, I now get paid in it and hedge my risks accordingly with bitreserve, but as far as holding as an investment I'm not too sold that there will ever be another bubble in price.

There's only really one scenario where home mining is still worth it. That is, you live in a cold place, where you aren't paying for electricity, and your heater isn't very good. So now you can turn that free electricity into both heat and a small amount of BTC. 
@_date: 2015-12-19 23:47:25
I don't personally use BFX, I have nothing against it though and they have the most liquidity of any western exchange. 
Keep in mind that Bitfinex uses peer lending to facilitate leverage. This means to go long you must loan out $ against your coin, and pay interest on that loan. Right now rates on USD swaps are just over 0.05% a day, this means if you took out around a 3.3x leveraged loan right now you'd be paying about $8/day in interest. 
As far as getting orders filled, well you always have the option to place a limit order to close out and hope it fills so you avoid slippage. You also have the ability to market sell. Assuming that liquidity stays about where it is now, in the event you want to place a market order, you'd probably be looking at somewhere around $1 per btc in price slippage to sell what you need to to cover your loan, or conversely around the same amount of slippage to place a market buy order. Obviously this is heavily dependent on market conditions, I'm just looking at the orderbook at this exact point in time and there's plenty of orders on the books to fill either way.
Unless BFX has some major security breach and pulls a Gox, you should have no issue withdrawing your coin once you decide to. If you're keeping the position open long term, make sure you have two factor enabled obviously, and don't forget that you set up two factor when you finally do decide to withdraw. 
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:28:21
Hard to say, BTC is volatile, but alts are a whole other level. Because all alts are denominated in BTC normally if BTC takes a big hit, alts take an even bigger one. There are a few coins with direct USD pairs, but the markets still heavily rely on BTC arbitrage. After all, if you want to cash out an alt for $, how are you going to it? Yeah, convert back to BTC or LTC so you can find a buyer either on exchange or locally.

There's a couple ways you could code something like this, either with Bitcoin Core and JSON-RPC, or through an API like blockchain.info.
I'm not much of a programmer to be honest, but I have been able to write a javascript websocket client that will notify me when a certain address receives or sends a transaction. This could probably be easily expanded to a list of addresses without too much difficulty. Once the script detects a transaction, it can then call a function that references a list of all your private keys for those addresses, match the one it needs, and import it to your new wallet.
To be honest, it's something I probably could do given enough time, but it would take me a while as my coding fundamentals are a bit lacking. 
Edit: As far as security is concerned with your private keys, this script could run completely clientside most likely, so as long as your network is secure and the machine running the script is free of malware your private keys should be plenty safe.

Well lets say on average each gamer has the equivalent of one R9 280x graphics card. This card can hash at about 800kh/s. So with 45000 of these this works out to about 36gh/s.
Ok I'm just going to stop right there 36gh/s is nothing, it will never mine 2800 bitcoins in any sort of lifetime. 
Edit: OK, at current difficulty it would take 20164.18 years to mine 2800 bitcoins with 36gh/s. 
Edit 2: Oops, I think I messed up, I was thinking Scrypt mining rates which are in kh/s, sha-256 with gpu are in mh/s, so that would actually be 36th/s, substantially more power, you could actually mine around 138 coins a year with that at current difficulty.

I'm not trying to say that a particular altcoin is the Ferrari, what I'm really trying to get at is there is a coin for all classes of vehicle, not just supercars. If we want a truly decentralized ecosystem, it's going to be hard to do with one coin and one mining algorithm. 
When the Model T came out it was the first the chance for the general public (middle class) to get their own vehicle, Ford's market share spiked to almost 50% a few years after starting to produce the Model T. Comparing Bitcoin to the Model T is really giving BTC too much credit, it's never held even a small fraction of the payment processing market, or made any dent in terms of market cap as a currency. 
But who knows, maybe Bitcoin will make it through these challenges unscathed and better than ever, I have emotional attachment to BTC as well and would still like to see it succeed. 
After analyzing my analogy, you are right, it's not that good. If BTC was the Model T of cryptocurrency mass adoption would have already happened, this is not the case, I'd now retract and say BTC is more akin to the automobile industry in the late 1890s, a testing ground for great things to come.

You are right, Cryptocurrency is the wild west of financial markets, sure there's some regulation now in the US but that doesn't stop individuals from exploiting the network by flooding it while simultaneously shorting a fat stack of coin with high leverage. I'm actually surprised we haven't seen that happen yet, maybe this "stress test" on Monday will be legit and we will see then. 
I'd like to think we still have enough time to come to consensus and have a painless fork, but in reality I don't think this is the case. Either blocks will start to fill up due to normal traffic, or flooding attacks WILL occur and bring us to the same conclusion.
I don't care what anyone says, fee competition is not going to be good for the Bitcoin ecosystem. Just because BTC was the first coin and has so far amassed the biggest market cap is not reason enough to keep using it after fees become excessive.
I was also a long time hodler and proponent of BTC for a couple years, but it's outdated now. It's done well with current adoption rates, but now the ship is taking on water and won't stay afloat for long without a patch. 
Now here's the part where if I haven't already, I'll rake in the downvotes. This space isn't limited to Bitcoin, just like the social networking space wasn't limited to Myspace. As you mentioned, this is a free market, if Bitcoin fails, sure it won't be good for the public image of cryptocurrency, and it will probably slow adoption of cryptocurrency for some time. But, this space isn't going anywhere, I may have lost some faith in Bitcoin, but the fundamental idea of blockchains and coins is still revolutionary, and guess what, there's already coins out there that can scale past what BTC can if given the opportunity.

One idea that comes to mind is a fair voting system. Instead of using a blockchain to send funds, you could create one to send votes. Any registered voter receives a vote token, they can scan it at the voting booth and send it to the candidate of their choosing. No more dealing with counting votes, as they would already be accounted for with no way of cheating the system as all votes would be transparent.

While still a relatively small market cap, BTC is no longer such an easily manipulated market, gone are the days where a few large whales could move the price 10s or 100s of percent in a few days. This is mostly because we have multiple high volume exchanges now, even if a whale can play one of them with a million dollar bankroll, that's still not enough to influence the leading chinese exchanges near as much as what was possible when things were dependent only on Gox, Stamp, and BTC-E. 
IMO the price is dropping because less people are using it as an investment vehicle and are now using it more for what it was made for: a way to send money easily with very little cost. Merchants are cashing out loads of coin every day through bitpay and coinbase, this doesn't help the price. 
bear targets sitting at ~350, ~240, ~100. Doesn't look like any chance of strong recovery until early next year, possibly February if looking at long term fib time zones. I'm going to be stocking up at all of these levels assuming they are hit, I don't think 2014 is the year of BTC, but 2015 may be.

Most efficient miners right now are probably the bitmain antminer s3, they run about $550 a pop.

Thanks for the advice. I've definitely not made any gains, I'm in the red as of now. I've never cashed out any BTC to my bank account, but I have acted as a middleman for cash on localbitcoins as well as friends who were looking to obtain some. I've also traded a shit load of altcoins. Overall I'd say my total BTC purchases are in the 10s of thousands, but most of which were immediately sent to someone else, and the cash deposited into my bank account to cover the coinbase transactions.

so by the time you get it sold BTC will probably be in post-bubble mode slowly dropping from around $3000-$4000, not exactly a good time to buy, but do as you please.
@_date: 2014-11-10 23:05:43
there's too many unknown variables to say for sure how much of an impact BTC's inflation has on the price:
* Amount of miners that are long term holders
* Amount of mined coins sold off market
* Amount of mined coins dumped on exchanges with no intention of buying back
* Amount of legitimate volume on Chinese exchanges
Worldwide volume is already surpassing 500,000 coins for today, of course 80% or so of that is from Chinese no-fee exchanges. Also keep in mind, Western exchanges are dying, most traders are playing on OK or Huobi now even if they are American, as the liquidity and room for profit is much greater, and the features of these exchanges have surpassed those of the Western ones as well. 
The real question is, how close to that 300,000 number are we at in legitimate volume? Sure there's a hell of a lot of bot trading going on, but there's a hell of a lot of real orders going through on the Chinese exchanges as well.
@_date: 2014-07-10 04:14:20
I have also spent quite a lot of time on the markets, and I've experienced news causing huge swings (mostly dumps from China FUD). Recently news hasn't done much to the markets other than the auction, but it's much easier for bad news to spread fear than good news to encourage buys.

I think what he means is, he was able to get his coins instantly minutes after logging in for the first time. With coinbase you have to be verified for a month before you get instant buy privileges.

Indeed, in my opinion altcoins add to the value of BTC. As an altcoin trader my main focus is to increase the amount of btc I have, and this a common goal among many who trade altcoins.

Hi there, I have been managing a Skyhook for a while now. I believe it is very secure, however our particular unit had been flaky up until the latest firmware update.
The only way out of kiosk mode is with a password, there is no way to crack or bruteforce this password. There are not even any physical buttons that can be pressed on the tablet while the machine is locked. And even if someone is able to get the unit out of Kiosk mode, there's no chance of them getting access to your blockchain account. First off, the ATM configuration settings are secured with yet another password, and even if the "hacker" was able to get this password as well, there wouldn't be any way to extract the password to the blockchain account.
I have had issues keeping my skyhook up and running 24/7, the network connection would drop frequently, but it looks like the latest firmware update has corrected this issue. Even then the software can still lock up from time to time and the unit needs to be reset, so you will definitely need to check up on it from time to time.

Not really likely. You see on a blockchain there must be proof of work to create new currency. Banks can loan out money they don't have, that money doesn't come from anywhere, it's simply typed into the system and is created, adding onto the ever growing stack of debt that fuels the fiat-based money system. 
Basically what I'm getting at, how valuable is a blockchain without proof of work?

BTC is the frontrunner, it was the first and has the largest market cap, so if any of these cryptos will hit mainstream adoption it will be BTC first. Taking that into consideration, yes it is already 50% mined which means Undoubtedly some lucky individuals have loads that they spent little to nothing on mining or buying near the beginning. BTC isn't just a pump and dump, it's a big cycle of endless pumps and dumps, which tend to become less volatile as price rises.
It will take some more years to see if things keep on a similar trend in relation to total coins mined to price ratio, but the idea is that the more coins that are mined, the harder they are to mine, the more rare they become which drives the price over the long term. BTC has the best shot at the moment to make it to that long term based off it's previous history, there are few altcoins that have the chance to survive near as long.
@_date: 2014-04-16 00:32:18

I've been having issues with the Skyhook I manage off and on, here is a link to the most recent firmware, I would trying downloading it an imaging the SD card with WIN32DiskImager software (free download). It is quite large uncompressed and you will likely need a 32gb SD card. You will need to run Win32DiskImager as administrator for it to work.
After you have done so put it back in the rPi and try it again, it should let you set your password. I can't remember when I first got mine but it may have come with a default password to log in? 
If you're still having issues I would recommend contacting the people at Skyhook, they are very helpful and normally respond in a fairly quick manner. That link I sent you for the firmware was emailed to me directly from them, if you do not trust it I completely understand and would suggest you ask them directly for the firmware.

That's the price you pay for convenience. Show me another service that does the same thing without KYC. Until there's a Bitcoin ATM at every corner (and competition brings down markup to 1%) Coinbase is the only way to purchase BTC with a low markup and without wiring your money to an exchange (also requires identification verification) or buying through someone locally (not convenient). 
If you're worried about your identity getting stolen from hackers, I assume you don't use online banking either, or have ever bought anything online with a credit card.

I don't see any reason to remove the cap. The only way this is possible is for the whole network to "fork" into a completely separate network that allows for more than 21 million coins. In order for this to happen everyone would have to agree (not just one person as there is no central authority) to implement a new network, and for everyone to switch over to it. If the majority of users can't agree to switch over to the new fork, then both forks would exist until one eventually dies. I don't see any reason for this happen.

It's a Skyhook. We chose it mostly because of how inexpensive it is, so we could test the market here. Being a in a fairly rural area we aren't expecting much volume unless we decide to put it in a location with more traffic such as a bar.
As far as the machine itself, I won't lie we did have some issues with it at first. It's not hard to set up but it has a couple flaws, one being the WiFi doesn't work very well being it is enclosed in a quarter inch of steel. It runs off of a Raspberry Pi and sometimes it does lose network connection even plugged in to ethernet. To be honest I probably wouldn't leave this machine somewhere where it could not be checked on frequently, not because of security issues but because it is prone to losing network connection and needing to be rebooted.

I would suggest a bank deposit option at localbitcoins, it's one of the cheapest and fastest methods on the site. All you have to do is take cash to the specified bank, fill out the deposit form with the localbitcoins seller's account number, and hand the teller the cash. 
Also, you can open a bank account at 16, not sure but you may need to have a joint account with your parents, however this gives you access to a debit card and routing number which allows you to buy bitcoins by ACH transfer, however I'm not sure which websites allow those under the age of 18, I don't think coinbase does.

It's near impossible getting BTC at a good rate without KYC/AML. One idea is you can move to china, invest some stake in a mining farm, and get paid in btc. This only would be profitable in china though because they pay nothing or next to nothing for power and they get way better deals on ASICs.

I do imagine gas stations get hit pretty hard with fraud, the problem is accepting BTC isn't going to reduce the amount of fraud. No fraudster is going to go to a gas station, pull out his stolen credit card, see that they accept BTC and say, "Oh damn well they accept Bitcoin, I better go get some of those instead of using this stolen card". 
But as far as CC fees, the stations are probably paying somewhere around 2-3%, so that would be a decent discount, 10 cent cheaper gas still sounds like a pretty good incentive.

Well if you haven't bought any back yet then you'll need to do so via coinbase first obviously. If you aren't concerned about privacy and actually having your private keys then I feel it's perfectly fine to keep your coins with Coinbase, most will disagree, but as far as 3rd parties go, they don't get much more secure.
If you'd rather buy coins and then actually have fun control over your keys, you could use a web based wallet like Coinkite, or download a wallet onto your PC or smartphone, there are many options.

Transaction fees should be able to be a dynamically changing market, the problem with this is we've been spoiled by low transaction fees, and we've come to identify the next to nothing cost of sending a transaction as one of the most vital features of Bitcoin.
So lets say we do have a fee war, it starts costing almost a dollar, or maybe more just to post a transaction. But then over on the side there are other forks (alts) that have the ability to scale without the need for excessive transaction fees. Why keep using an outdated system that costs more when there are better alternatives?
Until now alts have not had any real advantage over BTC, BTC works, and is cheap to transact with, but if this isn't the case anymore, why use BTC?
@_date: 2015-05-07 22:09:35
Sure that will work just fine. However, if you're not buying coins through Circle, there's really very little reason to use it as a wallet. There are plenty of other wallet options that give you control of your private keys which means you actually have full control of your coins. Off the top of my head there is Mycelium for Android, Greenaddress, Bitcoin Core, Blockchain.info.
I'm not 100% sure about circle, but these other wallets I mentioned should receive the coins instantly. You can also send the coins out of your wallet instantly as well, where the confirmations come in to play depends on how many the receiving end requires. Some sites only require one confirmation, some none, normally one is pretty standard however. 
If you're interested in how exactly you are able to receive the coins instantly and send them out instantly here's a brief explanation: Each transaction shows up immediately on the network after it is sent and will show as "unconfirmed", the wallets I mentioned above accept unconfirmed transactions. When a transaction is signed it is stored in the next block to be mined, as soon as that block is mined it will be confirmed, on average this takes about 10 minutes. So if you buy from LibertyX, send to your personal wallet, and then send to an address that requires one confirmation, all back to back within a few minutes of each other, chances are all these transactions will be in the same block. As soon as this block is mined a confirmation will be applied to the transaction and the address you sent to requiring one confirmation will now be credited.

I fear you are correct, I've also been a proponent for BTC for a few years, what people don't realize is the nature of this decentralized ecosystem includes more than just BTC, altcoins are laughed at right now, but what's going to happen when a hard fork never happens?
Well, sadly, what will happen will be the crippling of faith in Bitcoin, the downtrend will not end, it will get worse, price will be pushed down to 2010 levels, miners will shut down, most will leave the crypto space entirely.
But there still is hope for crypto, there are already options that will not have problems scaling, after the public image disaster that will be caused by the abandonment of the current largest blockchain, it is going to take some time for people to migrate back to crypto.
But I do believe it will happen, people will realize BTC was just a beta version, they will see the technology exists to do it right this time around, and eventually the "new Bitcoin" will experience more adoption than the failed original Bitcoin experiment, and this time it will not have issues scaling.
We must put aside the notion that BTC is vital to the goals of cryptocurrency, it was a necessary step as a pioneer, but the goals it is trying to achieve are still possible with better and newer technology, it must be laid to rest eventually.

If you could divide gold seamlessly into tiny fractions like you could with Bitcoin, why wouldn't you want to use it for everyday transactions? While fiat currencies have failed time and time again, gold and silver have always been around as a backup, and as real money. Sure both gold and Bitcoin are very volatile, the reason is people don't use it for everyday transactions, they hoard it and speculate with it.
This may not change, even if BTC becomes widely used around the world people may still favor holding on to it, but because it is so easily divisible and transferable there is no reason why it couldn't be used as an everyday currency and a true form of money.

Nobody will listen, but I think this is how it will play out, BTC has been great up to this point, it works with the current userbase, but we are now seeing the implications of scaling up and it isn't looking good.
There are alts that don't and won't have this issue assuming they actually get to the point where they are "king-coin". Bitcoin is the beta test of cryptocurrency. We need to stop being in denial, stop dreaming of becoming rich off of Bitcoin, and instead further the development and reach of cryptocurrency by any means. I don't think this means is to keep patching holes in a sinking ship, the SS Bitcoin has had a very interesting and monumental journey, but the iceberg is waiting not too far ahead, it's time to deploy the lifeboats.

First off, you may have not wiped over it, you may have just wiped over the bootloader and your windows partition is not showing up at boot. Pull the drive and hook it up with a sata bridge or external enclosure to another machine and see if you can see a windows partition. If not, the data is still there, you'll want to use a software such as Recuva, Wondershare, or GetDataBack to scan for lost files, you can set them to look specifically for .dat files which is what your wallet should be. If you have a substantial amount of coin I recommend taking your hard drive to a reputable computer repair shop (cheap) or  worse case scenario a data recovery lab (not cheap, anywhere from a few hundred to few thousand).

If you're using an ATM you are probably doing it for privacy purposes, there is no more anonymous way to purchase BTC with cash at the moment (no not even Libertyx, they still require KYC/AML). 
If there was an easy way to obtain BTC at market value with cash anonymously then ATM fees would be lower, conversely if an option like this existed there wouldn't be much need for ATMs.

There are currently no options to buy BTC at market price without disclosing personal information for KYC/AML. You can try posting an ad on Localbitcoins indicating you are wanting to buy at market price, but you likely won't get any hits. 
You can also try Liberty-X to get coins at market price, but you will have to submit your personal information just like any other KYC/AML compliant exchange. 
You can also try finding a Bitcoin ATM, if you are in a metropolitan area you may even find some with fees as low as 3-6% above market, however I'd say average fees for bitcoin atms are around 7-10%.

The only reason anyone would trade on stamp is if they are a big whale who thinks they'll have an influence on the whole market by manipulating a single exchange, but even this strategy isn't very effective anymore, people realize Stamp is now irrelevant and are an example of a business that failed to keep up with the competition.

really just a bunch of numerology/ biblical prophecy bullshit. Last stock market crashes have occurred almost exactly 7 years apart in September. This year happens to the the Shemitah which is like the Sabbath of years, according to the texts it is supposed to usher in the clearing of all debts.
Actually I think the Shemitah year ends on the 13th not the 23rd, whatever. 
Anyway I'm not religious but for some reason this 7 year cycle is a very real phenomenon, if there's going to be a big stock market crash, I feel there is a good chance it will happen in September.

Well it looks like this still hasn't been explained simply. Yes all you need is a public key and corresponding private key in order to safely receive bitcoin.
In order to send bitcoin out you will need to import your private key into a wallet software, this will do all that technical txid transaction signing stuff and sync with the network, but through an easy to use and simple GUI.
Wallets that support private key import (off the top of my head): Mycellium for Android, Bitcoin core client for PC, blockchain.info web wallet. 
Also: the chances of generating the same private key/public key pair as another wallet with funds in it is astronomically low (impossible), you'd have better luck getting struck by lightning twice while simultaneously winning the lottery in every US state.

You could have a quad SLI Titan-X rig and still not be able to mine more than a few cents worth of BTC in a month. The reason is the encryption algorithm (SHA256) used in bitcoin is now dominated by ASICS, which are like GPUs but designed specifically for mining on SHA256, a $100 ASIC miner will blow any GPU out of the water 100 times over. 
But if you'd like to mine with your cards there is still some hope. Many altcoins (like Bitcoin but with different mining algorithms) can still only be mined with GPUs, there are no ASICs for their mining algorithms. You could likely break even on electricity costs by mining these altcoins and then exchanging them for Bitcoin.
The issue with the above method is first off, like I said you'll be lucky to mine more than what you pay in electricity. Also the liquidity in altcoin-&gt;btc markets is very poor, you may have an issue even finding a buyer for these altcoins.
If you really want a decent amount of bitcoin the only way to do so is to buy it, unless you want to run a multi-million dollar ASIC farm.

It's utility and security are reasons why in the future it may work well as a currency, but currently the problem of liquidity and volatility does not make it a good currency. What's funny is the problem BTC is destined to solve is also the problem that is holding it back, traditional banking. If there was a secure way to instantly transfer fiat currency electronically and securely for almost free than the currency aspect of BTC would not be as valuable, yet it's value as a speculative limited commodity would not be changed.
Eventually if there's enough liquidity to where it becomes somewhat stable than its use as a currency will outweigh its use as a commodity and would really be a game changer for the world of finance.

It's now apparent that the last bubble to 1100 USD was sparked by the Willy bot committing fraud on Mt Gox followed by the emerging exchanges in China. We're now reaching a price level that rests near the top of the April 2013 bubble, and we are starting to break down through this level as well. In my opinion the big money will start to pour in at any time, but if current levels do not hold I'd guess anywhere between $75 and $150 as a bottom before true trend reversal.
My advice would be to start cost average buying now, this downtrend has been nasty but btc is no where near dead, the market is more alive than ever.

I see what you're saying, now that I think about it you are correct. To be honest it is probably sufficient just to deposit to an exchange (say BTC-E) and make multiple withdraws of random amounts (so that one could not match an address based off of identical transaction amounts within a short time frame). Sure exchanging to LTC adds an extra layer but if you are sending it to the same exchange with the end goal to withdraw in Bitcoin, there's really no difference, your withdraw is going to be from the same hotwallet.

It's pretty much free to send btc to anyone, anywhere, the problem lies with the fees incurred by the banks on both the buy and sell side of things. For instance, you can buy BTC on Coinbase for a 1% fee and send it to someone across the world, now depending on where they are located they may have some troubles getting the BTC back to fiat cash without incurring fees. If you're sending to China, this is no big deal, they can send the coin to an exchange and withdraw to their back account right away for little to no fees. But say you're sending coin to someone in Turkey, well they're going to have a tough time to find someone to exchange the BTC for their local currency, they may find someone willing to exchange face-to-face but that person is likely going to want about a 10% premium for their services.

I don't think this phishing attempt will have much luck unless they can really do some serious SEO. 
What I would do is offer bitcoin payment for your pre-order through bitpay or coinbase, not only is it easy to set up but you'll only be charged a 1% processing fee which is probably more competitive than your other payment options, and you'll be paid in USD not bitcoin so there is no risk of volatility on your end.
If you do accept bitcoin as payment than hopefully those looking to purchase the game this way will not be led to this phishing site if this is indeed what they are planning to do, but instead to your real site.

It's all speculation, if someone is willing to pay a high interest rate in a major bear trend then that is their decision. On the other hand, the market trend could change any time and that high interest rate doesn't seem so bad anymore as they've made money on the price of BTC, and now you've lost money because the price rise has exceeded that of the interest you were collecting on. 
If it's increasing your coin count, then great, that is beneficial to you, the person taking out the loan may have made a bad decision, but on the flip side your choice to loan out the coin could be a bad decision as well depending on how the market decides to move.
As far as legality, I really wouldn't worry about that, if you do plan on cashing out your coin for USD you will want to report and capital gains to the IRS if you indeed have any, even with the interest you are making it likely isn't enough to keep you ahead in this trend, unless of course you are also a successful trader.

@_date: 2015-01-01 10:01:43
To my knowledge almost if not all casinos and exchanges will immediately release a withdraw to the blockchain as soon as it is requested, and they will receive deposits as soon as the required confirmation(s) have been verified. As far as the blockchain is concerned, it does work on a sort of FIFO system. When someone pushes a transaction to the blockchain it is has to be confirmed by being included in the data of the next block to be mined. On average a confirmation takes about 10 minutes. Someone may submit a transaction right after a block has been found and must wait on average another 10 minutes before their transaction receives a confirmation when the next block is found, and someone may submit a transaction one minute before a block is found and will only have to wait that one minute before their transaction receives a confirmation. 
Now say for instance on a particular exchange one person requests a withdraw and then another user requests one 3 minutes later, they both withdraw to wallets that require one confirmation. Most likely a block has not been found within this 3 minutes before the second user withdraws, so both transactions will confirm when the next block is discovered and both users will receive the coin in their respective wallets at the same exact time.

I might get hate or be called a shill for this, but I really like Coinbase's vault. It uses multsig and gives you control of 2 out of three of the keys it generates, it allows you to still retrieve your funds in the event that coinbase goes offline or allows the convenience of accessing the funds from their interface. 
@_date: 2015-01-06 07:35:20
you create all of the private keys yourself and keep them in different locations (either on paper or different devices), so even if you lose one of the keys you still have access to the funds. 
Really as far as security is concerned though, I think one BIP38 encrypted private key is plenty enough security. You could go the extra mile and make three BIP38 keys and assign a multisig transaction to their corresponding public addresses., but really the value in multisig is for escrow. Or if you are worried about the possibility of being tortured to give up your private key, then multisig also comes in handy as even if you hand it over the attacker still needs another, he'll probably still kill you but he won't get your bitcoins ;)
I do like how Coinbase has implemented it though, it gives you control of two of the keys and one key is controlled by them through means of your login credentials, meaning you can choose to sign the transaction via their interface or you can choose to bypass their server altogether and sign the transaction with the other two keys. I'm not familiar with how other local wallets implement it, I know through bitcoinD you can use a console command in order to create a multisig address, I'd imagine there is another wallet with a more user friendly GUI approach.

Another option that doesn't require downloading anything is to make a wallet on blockchain.info and using the import private key feature to sweep the funds to that wallet, then you can send to your Circle account.

yes they are two separate entities, okcoin.com is the international version and the volume is pretty poor for spot trading, however they do offer futures whereas okcoin.cn does not.
If you are only looking to play with no margin or 2x-4x margin than okcoin.cn is the way to go, it's still the market leader as far as I can tell. Peer lending on okcoin.cn does incur interest but it's only like .1% a day so it's worth it if you want to try trading with some small margin. 
@_date: 2015-01-10 03:39:23
When you trade on an exchange and an order you placed fills, it isn't processed through the blockchain, you have to trust the exchange's servers are accounting for yours and other's coins correctly. In this case an exchange could be running what's called a fractional reserve, this means they know not everybody is going to withdraw all at once, so they take some of the user's coins for themselves and then just hope there isn't a panic withdraw cascade which would cause them to run out of coin and leave anyone else who hasn't withdrawn out of luck.

I consider myself a bitcoin trader (albeit a not very good one). What I like about trading this market is you can risk as little as you want, you don't have to put $5K into a trading account to get started, hell you could start with just $5. 
As far as the ongoing downtrend, there are many opinions on this but what it comes down to is lack of demand. The exchange Mt Gox that went belly up last year was committing trading fraud on a large scale, they ran a bot nicknamed "Willy" that bought up the price relentlessly during the bubble to $1100. The downtrend in my opinion has nothing to do with China bans (in fact Chinese exchanges are just as alive as ever, and are among the better platforms to trade on as they do not take fees for non margined trading). The real reason for the downtrend is the market is to correct from the "fake" prices that resulted from this scam of an exchange. The good news is, there are now multiple exchanges with good volume and not one single exchange completely leads the market like during Gox times.
If you can afford to lose $600 then sure give it a go, but if that's still a lot of money for you I'd suggest starting with maybe just $100 or two. And as far as the market forces, it's almost completely speculation, it's similar to trading a commodity, there are no earning reports, just mining metrics and news.

The cheapest, but least convenient route would be to use Libertyx and stack qpay pins until you get enough. 
The second cheapest would be a wire transfer to an exchange like bitfinex. You will have to pay the wire transfer fee, plus the trading fee on BFX, but this will still be far cheaper than any LBC seller. Good thing about this is you can wait for a period of decent liquidity on the exchange, so you can place one buy order and then be done.

My best guess is this trojan was specifically designed to steal BTC. I haven't used Multibit but according to the website your private keys are stored encrypted locally on your machine.
This would mean all the virus would have to do is keylog the last time you logged into the wallet, it then sent your encrypted private key to the attacker and he was able to decrypt the key with your password.

If Bitcoin continues to succeed you should expect much much higher than $3400 per BTC come the next halvings. Just look at the trend so far, block rewards are not getting any less valuable in $ terms after halvings, the opposite really. 
The idea here is that once block rewards are completely gone that there will be so many transactions that miners still have the incentives to mine as they will be making as much in transaction fees as they did with block rewards + transaction fees. As the block reward goes down, the amount of transactions grows assuming adoption continues to rise.
Once the block reward runs out, there will still be blocks, just no reward for finding them, so the miners will still be securing the network by mining blocks, and they will have just as much incentive to do so as they will get just as much reward or more from including as many paying transactions as they can. 
But you are correct, artificially limiting the block size means those securing the network could be ripped off in the future, unless transaction fees on-chain rise very substantially. This isn't necessary however when the block size can just be lifted and they can instead include multiple times more transactions rather than forcing the small amount of transactions to be very costly. 
It's really a political thing, either you want people to be able to use Bitcoin freely without limit, or you want people to be forced to use second layers that are not Bitcoin to keep Bitcoin from being inexpensive to use.

You can move to China where the hardware is cheaper and the electricity is practically free, then it is profitable if you're spending a good few mil $ or more on hardware. Otherwise you're better off just buying BTC if you are interested in accumulating some.

Depends on the state. In Texas, if you have a machine like a Skyhook, which just pulls coin from a wallet and does not ever interact directly with an exchange, this is just considered a peer-to-peer sale so it does not require a money transmitter license. But, if you have an ATM that is linked directly to an exchange you would need a money transmitter license. 
@_date: 2015-08-05 22:34:32

This is a good question. First off, because of the nature of Bitcoin, while it may still be inflationary for a number of years, it is very similar to a precious metal in the fact it does have limited supply, and the more that is mined, the harder it is to find more. 
Because of the way our money system works today, we have been conditioned to believe that an inflationary currency is absolutely necessary, and while that is true for the current system it is not true in general. The problem is, a shift to using limited resources as currency will only happen after the current system fails/collapses and people then realize that excessive money printing and inflation is the cause.
Until then, BTC is acting more of an asset, while a risky one, to hedge against inflation just like precious metals. 
Also, the current block size limit and lack of payment network overlays does not leave much room to grow for adoption as a payment network. Of course, this can change, but there's a possibility it won't and BTC will not excel in this category but may still be very successful as a long term store of wealth.

Really, all you have to do is send to an intermediary wallet that has no identity tied to it (IE not your Circle/Coinbase). That's really all it takes to break the link in who owns the coins in the event that the place you bought the coins from gets subpeonaed. Sure, they can assume that intermediary wallet belongs to you, but there's no way to prove it.

This is due to the speed of processing the ACH transfer from your bank. Once you've been with Coinbase for a month and are fully verified they will give you access to instant buy up to $1000 a week where you receive the coin immediately before the transfer hits your account.
For a quicker solution, there's Libertyx.com or Circle offers I believe $100 in instant buy right off the bat.

I'd like to be optimistic and say that a good amount of users will adopt BTC and keep the site afloat, but in reality I don't think this is the case. 
Realistically I'd think less than 15% of users will want to buy BTC just to use this site, when they previously have had no experience with it. Maybe at most 5% of their payments are already through BTC, but of course I don't have this number either so just a guess. 
Obviously it's more of a market suited for BTC, unlike Overstock which did about $3mil in BTC sales last year (less than 1% of total sales), I'd guess that Backpage could proportionally do at least a few times more in BTC sales. 
Even so, I wouldn't expect any website other than those darkmarkets that have been established specifically to only run off of BTC, to be able to come even close to enough BTC only sales to keep the site afloat.

Cash. That's it. Of course most of these people probably aren't intelligent enough to know to chargeback a paypal transaction, but they can at any time with no consequence. 
Greendot has changed up moneypaks and gift visas so those don't work well anymore either. 
One option is to set up a bank account with the purpose of receiving cash deposits, and giving out your account number so those looking to buy btc from you can do so that way. I've heard of rare situations where cash deposits can be reversed, but it's still way less risky than paypal. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 03:59:55
Well aside from buying things you need/want with BTC, this is still kind of tough. You can cash out via Coinbase/Circle, keep in mind you'll have to wait a couple/few days for it to hit your bank account and you also have to provide all required KYC/AML information to these companies.

Unless of course you've got a different software on there I'm not aware of that actually works.

Imagine a chess clock where each participant scans or enters their ID number before each match. This clock will not only keep time but also record to the "Chesschain". This can work with 2 of 3 multisig, so as soon as the match ends both players record the result on the clock, in the rare event of a dispute the trusted 3rd party (the chess organization) will then finalize the result of the match. 
Any number of these "Chesschain" clocks can join a party and the system will automatically assign tournament brackets. In addition, the Chesschain will immediately update player rankings, and at the end of a tournament dispense prize money.
To take things even further, a compatible board could also be linked to the network. This could record all moves, automatically punch the clock when a piece is let go, and actively transmit game data to overhead screens (or to live online feeds) so spectators can watch many games at once.
So many possibilities!

I think this is what you're looking for: 
And AFAIK you have to implement the spending address into the multisig transaction when it is made (there should be no limitations on what address you can send to), there are third party clients that will allow you to create a multisig transaction at the time of sending to send to a specified address. 
@_date: 2015-04-04 21:58:09
Keep in mind any of these solutions include trusting a third party with your coins. If you live in an applicable state for Coinbase USD wallet, that is probably the best way to go. 
One way is just to transfer to an exchange sell for fiat and keep it as fiat until you'd like to cash out or buy back btc. If you already use coinbase, when you are ready to cash out for real to your bank account you can buy back btc, send to coinbase and cash out. The cheapest way to use this method is with a Chinese exchange as they do not charge fees for trading between fiat/btc.
Another service is Bitreserve, you can deposit BTC and then trade it in for an "e-card" for any other "real" currency. This still doesn't do much good because you can only use this e-card with someone else who will accept it, but at any time you can convert one of these cards back to btc for a 0.45% fee.

I still really like coinbase, with full verification I can still instant buy up to $1000 worth of btc a week. I've tried circle and it is great too, when they don't cancel your orders. I've never had more than 1 coinbase order be canceled, but my second purchase from circle was.
As far as Chinese exchanges, Huobi.com and OKcoin.cn are the market leaders and I've never had an issue with either of them outside of frontend lag during peak times, they also both havery English versions of the site. Keep in mind, unless you have a Chinese bank account you will not be able to withdraw fiat straight from either of these exchanges, you will need to transfer coin back to wherever you have your bank account linked to cash out.

I've thought about how something like this could work. Actual implementation of the below idea is above me, but here's how I'd imagine it working:
You receive a bill say for one whole BTC, it only contains one QR code on it. You open your "Bitbill" app on your phone and scan it or simply scan it at a point of sale terminal to accept it. As soon as you do so the amount of the bill will be displayed and ownership of the bill will be transferred to an identifier stored on the scanning device. 
These bills can also be generated from your wallet balance within the app and printed out, or you can chose to invalidate any bill you own and sweep the funds to your wallet. If you try and spend this bill now, the receiving end will recognize it is no longer valid. 
This app could potentially be built on a decentralized platform (possibly a sidechain?) so that there is no third party risk associated. And as you simply print out the bills, you will not have to order them from a centralized company and hope they haven't been sweeped by the time you receive them. 
After writing this all out it kind of seems impractical, why not just send BTC directly to your recipient? Well simply put this saves time. You no longer as a sending party have to pull out your phone to send the coin, and wait for the receiving party to pull theirs out so you can scan their public address and input the amount (and possibly wait for confirmations). This system would make it so the only thing that needs to be done is for the receiving end to scan the bill, and the transaction is done. This system could also facilitate automatic processing of left over change to the previous owner's wallet as that information will be stored within the bill. 
@_date: 2015-04-29 00:36:56
Price action may be somewhat, but the longer the price stays somewhat stable the bigger it will break one way or the other.
Transactions, however, have been growing at a steady pace, more people are using BTC as a method of wealth transfer than ever before. 
@_date: 2015-04-10 04:10:28
It could take way longer than an hour with 10 confirms (or way shorter), on average 1 confirmation takes 10 minutes, but it's really just dependent on how fast a block is found which can take anywhere between seconds and sometimes up to an hour or more on very rare occasions to just do a single confirmation. 
I can understand this company requiring one confirmation, that is pretty standard, but if I was running this site I wouldn't even want to have the security of 10 confirmation, I'd probably want to automatically convert that amount back to USD within a few minutes as a lot could happen in the market in 30 minutes to 2 hours.

@_date: 2015-04-23 08:47:51
So far the way this market has worked is the majority of the time the price will be on the decline, and every once in a while there is a major surge in demand resulting in a short lived bubble and then the process repeats. 
We also have to remember that Bitcoin is not even close to deflationary yet, blocks of 25 coins are mined into the system on average every 10 minutes. Eventually, almost 100 years from now when 99% of all coins are mined, this will not be the case, but until then there will likely be more supply than demand in the market, there is always a chance for big developments causing surges in demand, and there's also a chance something extremely big will cause a permanent demand that outweighs the rate of inflation.

Been managing a skyhook for almost a year now and volume  has just recently started to pick up (still very modest numbers however). I'm not sure what ATM you are planning on getting, and if it has the ability to restock itself from an exchange, but ours does not. In this case, as long as our current stock which is normally only a few coins is bought within a fairly timely manner, a good amount of profit is made. Considering the Skyhook only cost $1000 it has just recently paid itself off, but that was mostly because we were lucky to see a transaction a week until a couple months ago. 
In my state a money transmitter license is not required because the machine does not interact with a 3rd party exchange, it just sells coin from a personal hot wallet.
The biggest obstacle with the Skyhook has been keeping it up and online, previous firmwares were very buggy and the machine will still lock up and need to be rebooted from time to time. Just recently had an issue where API access became disabled and it would take a customers money and then return a transaction error. But when it does work it does the job.

Depending on where you live you may need a money transmitter license, or maybe you don't. If you purchase BTC through an ACH service like Coinbase or Circle your account will likely be flagged for any transfers to/from these companies for an amount greater than $1000 a day. 
If you stick strictly with cash, say you buy your coins locally or through a service like Libertx you won't have to worry about you bank or Coinbase/Circle/Insert Bitcoin "Bank" here placing holds on your accounts or asking for a money transmitter license.

By the time something like this happens (if it does) I believe it will be in part due to regulated exchanges. Now hear me out, I'm just as against regulation as everyone else, but lets face it, a regularly audited exchange with an existing proven and tested high frequency trading engine is what this is going to take. 
Coinbase has taken a good first step, while only available in 25 states, it does demonstrate how a professional trading platform should operate. The Winklevoss should be launching Gemini any time as well which should be very similar, and now the GBTC fund is about to start trading and hopefully COIN will be making it's appearance sometime soon. That's a lot of money ready to pour into trusted and insured platforms.

It's a high risk gamble, but it could pay off. IMO the price is at a low enough level to think about starting to cost average buy. It could very likely hit $100, maybe lower, or a large trend reversal could have started today, no one knows.

* Step 1: Find satoshi
* Step 2: torture him for his private keys, or dope him with scopolamine and ask for them
* Step 3: Transfer all of his coins to all major exchanges, dividing them proportional to each exchange's volume.
If you make it this far, just the sight of his coins moving, and even worse to an exchange (or all of them) would cause enough fear to drop the price likely into single digits before those transactions even confirmed. 
Now you've got ass loads of coins on all exchanges, the price is already near the verge of death. This is when you go for the kill, you market sell the orderbooks on all exchanges down to 0. You've just annihilated the Bitcoin market and all it took was kidnapping Nick Szabo ;)

Oh I'm not saying there's not, it's entirely possible BTC remains king of the crypto-land, but this will be because of additional centralized payment layers, like what 21inc is trying to accomplish. Yes 21 is trying to distribute the hashing power, but when it comes down to it they are in control of the pool, which means if successful, they basically dictate the network.

Here's how I see decentralized exchanges playing out in the future, however I could be completely wrong:
First off in order to get over the hurdle of transferring fiat securely, and instantaneously, we'd need crypto fiat. Obviously this is nothing like Bitcoin, there will not be limited supply, there may not even be mining, just a way to peg fiat value to a blockchain. There are already projects doing this, but so far there is not one clear leader in the space.
So say we do get to the point where all our fiat is digitized and secured cryptographically on a blockchain. We would probably see a very slow transition until eventually no one is using cash or debit cards any more, just this digital cash. At this point we can easily exchange our crypto fiat for Bitcoin with no third party, just by facilitating the use of both blockchains.
The question is, if we do end up with this secure, instantaneous cryptographic fiat payment network, will there be a need for Bitcoin? I'd wager yes, at this point ownership off all assets, and all sorts of contracts will be processed through blockchains. In the end, this digital cash will still have no limited supply, the same problems that is has today minus the outdated payment processing. Now people will start to think to themselves, "how can I protect my wealth against inflation"? 
The answer to that question may be Bitcoin, and it will be as simple as a single click of a button to exchange their fiat to BTC, or probably any other number of digitalized assets.

Well depending on the timeframe BTC has not been raising in price, the past year and a half have been full on brutal downtrend from $1100.
If you want my opinion, since we've seen a near 80% drop since the last top, it's starting to become attractive to start buying and holding. I'd cost average buy a little each week from now on if you are looking to "invest".
@_date: 2015-04-03 18:46:01
Also FYI if you are concerned about the exchange rate of Bitcoin changing before you are able to cash it out there are services that will let you hedge your coin to the current USD value at time of deposit.
Only issue with cashing out BTC is the easiest way to do so is through ACH (direct deposit) to a bank account, which of course leaves a paper trail. 
However you can use services like localbitcoins or mycelium trader app to sell your bitcoin for cash, and also charge a markup for your services (normally about 8-12%), so if you get a big enough client base paying in bitcoin, you may actually be able to squeeze some extra cash out by reselling it.
@_date: 2015-04-24 05:31:59
In essence pretty much, but with only one QR code that would connect to the "Bitbill" network and  be able to facilitate change. Here is how a transaction would look:
* Cashier asks for payment
* Customer hands over paper Bitbill or displays the QR on his phone
* Cashier scans Bitbill
* Change is automatically sent back to customer's Bitbill wallet
So now the customer has an option to either 
* A. Print Bitbills in different denominations for ease of use or for situations when you don't have a smartphone.
* B. Create Bitbills on the fly with one click or specify custom amount on their smartphone
@_date: 2015-09-26 02:23:07
News used to really move the price of BTC a few years ago, this was when you could count the number of exchanges on a single hand, and none of them offered leverage. 
Big enough news will still affect the price. Mostly, however, BTC is stuck in a slow perpetual downtrend now that people realize it cannot scale and is not good for use as a currency. But, as long as it can remain the largest blockchain, it will still hold value as the most secure and decentralized distributed ledger, which is still very practical for building on top of with sidechains that will allow for a higher capacity of transactions.

The biggest exchanges for spot trading with minimal (2-4x leverage) are Okcoin.cn, Huobi.com, and Btcchina.com. All these exchanges have a pretty good track record with no security breaches, a few mistakes and bugs have popped up rarely though. 
For more leverage, you'd want to check out futures. 796.com offers the most leverage (up to 50x), but Okcoin.com looks to be the market leader in terms of volume offering up to 20x leverage. I prefer Bitvc.com which is Huobi's futures platform because of their flash trade interface that includes real time data and one click orders priced in Yuan.

As far as buying goes (in the US) libertyx, coinbase, and circle are by far the easiest and quickest ways to get coin, however they are not the most anonymous. Personally, if I am transferring somewhere that I would not like to be public to coinbase/circle, I will first send the coins to an intermediary wallet like mycelium or breadwallet, then to xotika.

Are you interested in trading other major markets with BTC? I recently discovered 1broker.com which lets you trade CFDs on commodities like gold and oil, also a few major indices, and also some Forex pairs with adjustable leverage. Overall a solid platform from what I've seen so far, and no issues with liquidity as they are CFDs so the market data is just referenced and an orderbook system is not used.
If you'd like to give it a go consider using my referal link, or not, you won't hurt my feelings: 
Also note, personally I would not consider holding a CFD as a long term investment, I would rather actually own a real share or the physical commodity, but it's a lot of fun to play with some leverage on the short term.

Normal coinbase fees aren't really that bad, like 1%, however sometimes their buy price is a bit above exchanges like stamp and finex. 
To be honest there is not really a hassle free single exchange right now for both withdraw and deposit. If you are purchasing relatively large amounts ($2000 +) I'd recommend coughing up the wire transfer fee and wire to bitfinex, however if you only want a few hundred bucks worth the $25-40 wire fee won't be worth it. 
I wouldn't recommend stamp not because of their recent withdraw problems, but because their liquidity is terrible and getting an order filled isn't exactly guaranteed. 
It's actually easiest for the Chinese, the 0 fee exchanges like Huobi and OK have easy online banking transfers, which is funny because half the people here still think China wants nothing to do with crypto.

I know this is and I'll get hate for even mentioning alts, but the only way I can think of to trade in real time on a decentralized exchange is with a fiat backed coin. You see you can purchase bitusd or whatever and have a coin that is pegged to USD on this exchange, so you've pretty much got dollars now but with the security of a blockchain. From there you can now easily trade to BTC, LTC, whatever without placing trust in a centralized exchange.
There is no other way to make a real-time decentralized exchange. The holdback now is fiat, there currently isn't any way to transfer fiat securely and instantly without the possibility of chargebacks, this is why a truly real-time decentralized exchange will need a fiat pegged crypto to trade with.

Tradingview is great for charting. Cryptowat.ch is great for real-time charts and has a few drawing tools (Fibs and lines).

bitmaintech is pretty much the most reputable name in mining hardware right now. Keep in mind you probably will not pull out $200 worth of bitcoin out of a $200 investment, however it is a good way to learn a bit about bitcoin/blockchain and is a fun hobby.
So you've already got the PI, now all you need is some ASIC(s). If you were looking to spend a bit more I'd recommend the Antminer s5, however you can buy these little dudes as you wish for only $20 a pop and gradually add to your hashing power:  . If you go this route you will also need a powered USB hub to hook them up to that will then plug into your pi.
@_date: 2016-05-18 23:26:36
You could hook up a cheap USB asic to it that would likely be able to mine a Satoshi per day, problem is you'd need to let it run for multiple years just to cover the cost of the transaction fee to withdraw from the pool. 
Alternatively you could set it up to solo mine on the rpi's cpu. The chances of mining a block with that though are probably worse than getting struck by lighting 5 times in one minute while simultaneously winning every lottery in existance. 
@_date: 2016-05-21 00:22:18

No disagreement there. Miners can and will create a chain they think users will want. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 19:09:34
It's one of  two things, an empty threat, or a way to start a new coin. Once the activation date hits, hashrate will likely be somewhere under 5% of the current Bitcoin network. This means that it will take hours to find a single block, also meaning the difficulty will not adjust for months. A hard fork on the UASF minority chain will then occur to adjust the difficulty back down so the chain is usable. The market will then price in what it thinks this new fork is worth. Exchanges aren't just going to remove Bitcoin and replace it with this UASF fork, they aren't suicidal. I'm sure many will add the UASF fork as an additional asset, but many probably won't even bother.
Or they'll just call it off when the date approaches and they realize they have no miner support.

You do realize that almost 80% of the Bitcoins are already in circulation, but maybe 1-2% of those are on all exchanges combined at any given time. 
It's going to take about 100 years to mine the rest of them, meaning the banks would have to continuously buy all the Bitcoin on every exchange for 100 years, and then best case scenario they get maybe a 10% share of BTC, the other 90% are now insanely rich when denominated in the bankers fiat. The bankers have effectively devalued their fiat currency and made Bitcoin stronger. At that point it's unlikely Bitcoin is even denominated in fiat, but goods and services are denominated in Bitcoin instead. 
Now I'm not even taking into account the potentially unlimited amount of cryptocoins other than Bitcoin. What do you think that the banks are going to print money constantly to buy every other cryptocoin that pops up. Not to mention other coins are denominated in BTC, so if BTC goes up in fiat value, so do they without anyone even having to buy them. This would send their fiat into a hyperinflationary spiral, and only accelerate the growth of the cryptocurrency market, that is not a good plan for them.

Yeah, really sucks that Circle stopped selling BTC, they were by far the cheapest and quickest way to buy. 
Coinbase is honestly the only decent option nowadays to buy through ACH or credit card, but as you said their customer service is pretty bad and very slow. For less than $1000 at a time wire transfer really aren't worth it, but if you were wanting to make a fairly sizeable buy I'd wire transfer to Bitstamp or Bitfinex for the best rates. 
One service to look into that I haven't personally tried is Libertyx.com. There's apparently loads of cornerstores and such that have their vouchers on their billpay terminals, the trick is getting a competent cashier to find the button to sell you the voucher. Then you can exchange the voucher for BTC on the Libertyx site.

Well there's no risk of any trader failing to pay back a loan, either they pay it back, they get force liquidated, or the loan expires (while interest is being paid to the lenders daily). A trader can't withdraw funds he took out on margin. 
The risks are that the exchange goes dark or insolvent, that's it. You can't really put a number on that, you can judge an exchange's track record and hope for the best.
Also, while they call it peer lending, it's not decentralized. It's just a way for the exchanges to pool liquidity from those looking to lend instead of providing their own reserves to enable leverage for traders.

I see value in a hard fork to bigger blocks, you don't, but that doesn't mean every other user agrees with either your nor I. That's the beauty of this system, when there is a divide such as this, the miners can provide a new product to meet the demands of those not happy with the current path. Then the market forces can sort out which chain becomes more valuable. A free market at it's finest, what a time to be alive to witness it.

Not all coins are available for sale on exchange, actually only a tiny fraction of them are. If banks were to buy up every coin on every exchange, they'd have to pay a shit ton first off as they'd be buying up the price to who knows how high, remember somebody has to be offering coins to sell for them to buy. Then there's no coins left on the exchanges for a little while, the banks are stuck with a bunch of coins they severely overpaid for as the price then finds equilibrium when other market participants jump back in.
That would be a terrible idea for them, they would just make bitcoin even stronger by substantially raising the price and still being left with only a slim fraction of the total coin supply. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:51:05
possible sure, but to ever get to the point where the transaction fee costs less to withdraw than what you've mined would take an eternity with CPUs or GPUs. You can mine other coins with GPUs and trade them for Bitcoin though, or use Nicehash which does that for you automatically. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:46:23
You can't "buy all of them", you can only buy what people are willing to sell either on exchanges or OTC, only a very small fraction of the BTC currently in circulation is being offered for sale. 
As far as new coins that haven't been mined yet, that's only about 25% of them, and it's going to take about 100 years to mine the rest of them, with the block reward halving and make them more scarce every 4 years. 
But to answer your question, say someone does amass a massive stash, then it comes out that he's lost the keys or he's died and no one can decrypt them but they can still see his massive stash. This removes supply from the market making the rest of the BTC available for sale more valuable.

LN still has to write data for each transaction to a block which will still come around on average only every 10 minutes. So you could say that LN may have a more accurate "metronome", but Bitcoin itself will not (unless its on-chain block time is sped up by means of hard-fork).

But BTU doesn't exist as a blockchain, that's a futures token, right now there is only Bitcoin, no other competing Bitcoin forks are traded on exchanges. You can't buy BTU and then withdraw it anywhere. 


Precisely, so you agree that this all hinges on miner support, because it does. Currently the only known miner support is those on Slush pool, totaling a whopping 0.44% percent of the total network hashrate. Let's say 1% to be generous, that's not near enough to extend the chain faster than the legacy one. Exchanges are not going to take the risk in listing a gimped coin that has no security and no throughput, that would be insane. Miners aren't going to mine it without exchange support, exchanges aren't going to list it without miner support, it's dead in the water and Luke knows it, this is why he's planning to change the PoW when it inevitably fails to gain any sort of real support.

What came first, the Bitcoin or the Bitcoin market?
This really isn't a chicken and egg situtation, the miners can mine whatever chain they want, the market can push them and give incentives to meet their demands, but when you have a market that demands more than one implementation, you can't really say that one of those implementations is not "valid". If the market gives it value, and that chain can survive, it is plenty valid. It may not be "valid" to any other chain, but if that other chain becomes valued less, which is really Bitcoin?

A hard fork does not necessarily mean a prolonged chain-split for any amount of time. Bitcoin has already had a few hardforks in the early days and we still only have 1 Bitcoin chain. Any fork without replay/wipeout protection will either take over as the longest chain and become Bitcoin, or it will lose out to the other chain and be abandoned. 
Any fork with replay/wipeout protection is admittedly an altcoin, as it will not share the same transactions as the prior chain past its time of forking (however it will retain transaction history from prior to fork). However, if such a chain was able to garner more miner support and also be valued higher by the market, it would probably be safe to say that the old chain is the altcoin at that point. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 21:01:07
Not only does each coin have to be originally mined, every transaction must also be confirmed and included in the next block of coins to be mined.
You could say duplicate your wallet with one btc to another machine and not let it completely sync with the network (this just means receiving the newest block data that contains the newest transactions). So now both machines say you have one coin. Now say on one machine your wallet is up to date and synced with the latest blocks, and you send one coin to another address.
You can now go to your other machine with the unsynced wallet, and it will still show 1 coin. So now you try and send out that coin from this wallet. But you'll notice that coin that you didn't actually have will never send. Why? If you don't let the wallet sync to the latest blocks the transaction will never be posted to the newest block to be verified, and if you do let it sync to the newest blocks it won't send either, because as soon as it does sync you balance will correct to 0 as it will see the transaction you sent earlier in the newest block.

those are Segwit (Bip141) blocks, not Segwit2x, those are the orange ones (Bip91). The "NYA" in their coinbase text is just signaling intent, so they will likely actually start signaling Bip91 soon.

So you agree then, 87% does not support segwit on it's own.


That's actually not how the protocol works. Miners create a product and thus create the rules, then users decide which product (chain) they want to use. If the majority of users do not like the product the miners are creating, they simply abandon it for one that does suit their needs. This is basic economics. Of course miners have incentive to serve the users, otherwise they mine a worthless product, but in the end they are the ones that make the chain.

There is no Bitcoin without miners. Remember Bitcoin was around before any exchanges ever traded it. You can run all the non mining nodes you want, they aren't extending the chain and they are not including transactions into blocks on their own. This is not a proof-of-stake system, if you're looking for that I would encourage you to seek an alternative coin.

Contrary to what everyone else will tell you, if you have free electricity, you can make a profit. 
ASICs are getting faster, but more-so they are getting more efficient power wise. This means you can find some older units that hash just as fast as the newer ones, but they consume more power. If you don't have to pay for power, then you can use the advantage of cheaper hardware to hit your break even point sooner. 
So really it all comes down to what kind of deal you can find on some units, if you can get them for cheap enough you can turn a profit, and if the price of BTC happens to be a low point now, even better.

Miners have always had control over the blockchain, they do make the chain after all. Spin up all the non-mining nodes you want but it doesn't matter when proof-of-work advances and secures the chain. it's up to the market to incentivize the miners to meet its needs, if it can't then the market abandons those miners for ones who do satisfy their needs.

Competing, but half the same. Segwit2x first activates Segwit, the goal of Bip148, then 3 months after a hardfork to 2MB base block size occurs


That's up to the market to decide, that is its job.  


If Segwit2x does not activate before August 1st, Bip148's minority chain will, this will be a similar effect to a hard fork that does not have consensus as the Bip148 chain will be out of consensus with the majority of miners and wallet providers


There will be a hard fork as long as anyone is mining on the Segwit2x client come 3 months after Segwit activation (a soft fork). Whether or not this fork will be the majority chain is yet to be determined, but the incentives for it becoming the majority chain are good, considering that chain will have double the capacity of the current chain.


Yes, if they do not adhere to the consensus rules of the majority, they split off from it, this is what happens with Bip148 if Segwit2x does not activate before August 1st.  
@_date: 2017-07-14 11:24:46
It can't simply become an alt with its current code, with how it is right now it either becomes the majority chain, or it doesn't and is abandoned when no or next to no blocks are mined on it, or it gets some miners support but becomes severely shorter than the main chain allowing it be attacked soon causing miners to abandon it. Luke-Jr has expressed his intent to fork it again when it fails to become the majority chain, this would allow it to live on by adjusting the mining difficulty down or completely changing the proof-of-work algorithm altogether, but yes that very much will make it just another altcoin. The only similarity to the Bitcoin chain at that point would be previous transaction history of the chains before the split.

He's not wrong, read his post carefully again. 0x20000010 still signals the Bit 4 Bip91 activation, this is a prerequisite for the BTC1 client to start enforcing the orphaning of non-segwit signaling blocks.

Yeah good luck proving that (you can't, anyone can signal Bit 4 if they want right now no matter which client they're running).

currently 45% of the hash power supports segwit on it's own, 87% supports segwit along with a 2MB hardfork. You can't just group these two camps together, that would be a composition fallacy. 
This mess is no one's fault in particular, it's a strong difference in the vision of what the individuals of the ecosystem believe. Luckily, Bitcoin is built for this sort of thing, when the differences cannot be settled the chain is hard forked, and then a winner is found by the market.

Probably more trouble than it's worth to try and get an API to work with VB, as far as I know there aren't any APIs compatible with VB so you'd have to code an inbetween in another language first, so you may as well just use another language.
I'm just starting to get into coding with the [blockchain.info api]( So far it looks like the best way to work with it is to run a local webserver through an easy setup application like XAMPP or WAMP. From there you can use PHP and MYSQL and Websockets to do anything you need with the API. 
You could likely get the blockchain.info Websocket server to work with VB however it is only useful for real time transaction data and will not allow you to post any transactions to the network.

Segwit2x has not been officially released, that is scheduled for the 21st. You can see current intent to signal for it at 
If segwit2x does not activate segwit before August 1st then Bip148 will, but that doesn't mean it wins. On the contrary, the most likely scenario in this case is that is does not have anywhere near enough mining power to find blocks in any decent time, meaning it becomes the shortest chain and is abandoned, and nothing really changes as the main chain continues on.

BTC is not handle by banks, it is stored either on a local wallet (a program on his computer) or on an online wallet provider (similar to a bank, but for Bitcoin), or possibly on a paper wallet printed out.  
Now almost certainly either of these are password protected, if it's an online wallet you *might* be able to contact the company and provide proof of death to get the password reset and get access to account and retrieve the coins.
if it's a local wallet and it's encrypted with a password, and he's the only one who knew that password, those coins are good as gone. Nothing you need to do at that point.
If his family does have access to his computer, it would be worth looking to see if he has any of the following programs installed:
* Electrum
* BitcoinQT
* Armory
* Multibit
There are other local wallets, but those are the ones that come to mind.
If he stored his coins with an online wallet, the most popular by far in the US is Coinbase, so he may have an account with them. Otherwise there's many other wallets and exchanges as well, if his browser history is still present maybe you'd be able to find one of these sites where he may have kept his coins.
There's also a possibility he used a paper wallet. With Bitcoin, to have control of coins all you actually need are two "keys". A public address that the coins can be sent to, and a private key which can be used to export the coins to any other local software wallet. It may be worth looking around for a piece of paper that looks something like [this](
Another possibility is a hardware wallet, a little handheld electronic device specifically for storing Bitcoin. Common examples are [Trezor]( or [Ledger](
As you can see, there's literally hundreds of possibilities of where he may have stored his coins. But I guess to actually answer your question, his coins are almost certainly lost now and cannot be retrieved, unless you get lucky and find a paper wallet laying around, a local wallet that is not password protected (or he has his password written down somewhere), or you are able to work with an online wallet provider to recover his account. 
Hope this helps.

Doesn't matter what exchanges call it, matters what it's worth and if the miners have incentive to mine it based on that worth. I agree, the users do give the chain its value, but they do not make the chain, they simply choose which chain they want to use, giving it its value. 
The exchanges have killed Bip148s prospects by still not taking the substantial risk to admit they will list it. First it will need miner support. It is a bit of a catch-22, you won't get exchange support without miner support, and you won't get miner support without exchange support.
However, an exchange can't trade a chain that doesn't exist in the first place, and in Bitcoin's case, the chain needs proof-of-work. 
What's also great about proof-of-work, is it ensures that the chain with the most work is the longest which means that for it to survive without replay/wipeout protection it has to have more hashrate than its competitor to survive. Luckily for Bip148, Luke is just going to change the PoW algorithm, so it will be a whole new chain anyway that doesn't care about the value that has been built on top of the existing $billions of ASIC hardware, those that want to follow him can just leave Bitcoin behind. If you can't win by the existing rules that has had value built on top of, just change them and see if people follow, there's nothing wrong with that, but you can't expect the majority to jump off the cliff.

If UASF becomes the dominant chain after August 15th, you will be able to withdraw the BTC you bought for ETH on this pair, if it doesn't you get nothing, at least from what I understand. Now that Bip148 is going to be an altcoin you may still be able to withdraw it as long as the chain survives.

Nope, transactions do not effect the rate at which blocks are mined. This is solely determined by the network hashrate, which adjusts itself every two weeks as more hashrate is added or removed from the network. So say a lot of hashrate is added to the network right after a difficulty adjustment, you would expect blocks to be a bit quicker on average until the next adjustment.

I agree, they should act based on economic incentive, and they do. I'm not a huge fan of Segwit2x, to be honest I'd like to see it fall through, it's just looking likely at this point it will be pushed through based off of signaling intent, but intent does not equal action. And of course the hard-fork part can be backed out on by any miner after segwit is activated.
I think the issue still stands though with security as well. Let's say segwit is activated through the means of sw2x, and then the miners have a choice to either stay on the sw2x client or swap back to core. Neither of these choices are exactly the superior choice for security, the superior choice for security is the one that has the most hash power securing it. There's nothing fundamentally dangerous about 2mb blocks, the only "dangerous" part is the process of the hardfork itself, which is straightforward enough. If it comes to this, in my opinion miners who don't care so much about throughput still have to consider what is best for security, and as long as a decent chunk of them don't back out, then the rest won't want to either and staying on the sw2x will be the safe choice, but it definitely is a slippery slope. Basically what I'm trying to say, is it doesn't seem that backing out on the hardfork is the safe and secure choice, it's just as risky if not more risky than staying with the sw2x client.

It aint my code. But really, the only that matters is if the market takes it serious, if so nothing you or I individually can do will stop it from becoming Bitcoin. I know, the free market is a bitch, but it is what runs this ecosystem. 
The segwit code is identical to Core's, so I'm not sure what possible grievances you could have with it, the rest of Segwit2x is just the activation mechanisms to expedite Segwit activation, and then to hard fork to 2MB base block size 3 months later. It's performed as expected on Testnet5, regardless of the lies that have been told around here. It simply had to wait for enough transactions to fill a &gt;1mb block, something that is not an issue on the main-net with far more transaction volume and actual economic incentive. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 00:45:20
They should be terrified of the code, but not because it's complicated or badly designed, but because it's about to fork them off of the longest chain if they choose to resist. The Core devs are obviously concerned about their loss of control, but it's too late now for them to do anything about it, they don't dictate the direction of Bitcoin, they can only provide code and hope miners and economic entities use it. Looks like that time is up though, the majority is fed up with them.
The hardfork is only as dangerous as it is contentious, there's nothing complicated about raising the block size limit to 2MB. If 80%+ are already running the Segwit2x client there's no reason to drag it out past 3 months, that just gives more opportunity to back out, not prepare. 
There definitely will be a minority that gets left behind, hence is the nature of a hardfork, but the winning side will be apparent in short time and that minority will either hop over or ragequit.

Most likely nothing, looks like segwit will have already activated by then by means of Segwit2x.

I don't really disagree with anything you've said here, but miners can sacrifice short term profits to extend another fork if they believe that fork will be more valuable in the future. Of course they're not going to run themselves out of business if it doesn't pan out, and they'll hop back to the original chain if it appears they will never get a majority on their side. But if they do get a majority on their side exchanges are now forced to upgrade to this chain, if they do not they risk their funds on the old chain being wiped out. In this case, exchanges don't have a choice in the matter unless they want to go out of business. If they refuse to upgrade to the longest chain, the funds that they hold are at very high risk of attack. 
Of course it is a balancing act, miners won't want to mine a chain without economic support, and exchanges won't want to list a chain without miner support. However, hard forks can and do happen, and they do have to be initiated by miners. If miners can rally together they can force the hands of the exchanges. They may have to give up short term incentives by initially abandoning the current chain, but that doesn't mean they can't be incentivized by longer term incentives to mine that new chain, especially when a majority of them are all coordinated to do so at the same time like they are with Segwit2x, which also has exchanges backed behind it. 
There has to be a leap of faith at the beginning of a hard-fork attempt, there's no way around it, but to say that exchanges won't upgrade if they see a fork with substantial majority hashrate behind it is silly, they can't just ignore it, unless literally every significant exchange does ignore it, which is unlikely when we're already seeing some major exchanges come out saying they will trade which ever forks happen to exist.

I wonder why that is, hmm I guess because blocks aren't full on litecoin, and even if it had as much transaction volume as bitcoin it still has 4-5x the effective capacity of BTC not even including segwit, so blocks still wouldn't be anywhere near full. I guess Litecoin must be super centralized with their insanely high capacity limits, right? 
@_date: 2017-07-13 16:54:18
Miners control the network, users decide which network they will use. Miners aren't retarded, they aren't going to change the rules of the chain they are heavily invested in a way that they know a vast majority of the market participants will simply get rid of their holdings and crash the value into the ground. That is not profitable for them, and remember this ecosystem runs off of incentives, which means each individual is trying to profit, removing the 21M cap only ensures they lose any chance at profit.  
@_date: 2017-07-14 03:53:18
Yeah, I mean I don't want Segwit either, at least not right now.

Trading BTC is like playing Texas Hold 'Em, sure you can have a lot of experience and with just a little of luck you'll make out on top, but it's still gambling even the most experienced will eventually get burned.

The creator of Bitcoin "Satoshi Nakamoto" (possibly a team of individuals, if I had to guess) did not originally publish the code to GitHub. When Bitcoin was first released into the wild in 2009 GitHub was just barely a thing, and it looks like the first release version of Bitcoin to make it onto Github was on [September 16, 2009](  so many months after the genesis block was mined on January 3rd, 2009.
You must realize however, that Bitcoin development is not controlled by a single entity, the proof-of-work algorithm allows for miners to decide who's code they run and thus what rules to enforce. Up until now that has been the Bitcoin Core client, but there are others competing at the moment for the miner's power, the leader appearing to be Segwit2x (btc1) at the moment, which has not been officially released but about 85% of miners have signaled intent to mine it when it is released (scheduled for July 21st). 
The only way to generate bitcoins is to mine, this requires specialized computers (ASICs) to solve hashes to find blocks of bitcoin (currently 12.5BTC, a block is found by a miner on average every 10 minutes, as more miners are added to the system, it automatically adjusts to raise the difficulty of mining and thus keeping this 10 minute average). The block reward is cut in half every 4 years (it started at 50, went to 25, now at 12.5), which controls the inflation, eventually all 21 million coins will be mined in somewhere like 100 years, then if Bitcoin is widely adopted the miners will then be sustained off of the fees that users pay to get their transactions included in a block.

MAHF refers to a miner activated fork that is able to takeover the current chain or is subject to take over by the current chain by means of hashrate majority. Since ABC (UAHF) has replay and wipeout protection, along with rapid difficulty adjustment for the first few blocks, it does not need a miner majority, so MAHF doesn't really fit the bill. It will exist independently of the current chain even if it doesn't have much miner backing behind it.

Because of the market price, they don't care about utility, they care about profits. Ideally they'd love for everything to stay the way it is, the market price is high and the fees are too, they are making a killing. 
The real question is, why would the market price in a minority chain with a very real security concern (51% attack) above the price of the longest, most secure chain? I doubt it will, but time will tell.

What's interesting about Segwit2x is since the first part of it (activating Segwit) is compatible with current Core nodes that run just about every exchange, there is no need for exchanges or wallet providers to update if they don't mine. Of course for the second half (the hardfork) this would require economic nodes to upgrade  to Segwit2x in order to operate on that fork.
[This link]( includes the list of signatories of the agreement. Additional miners have also started signaling intent as shown on [Coin.Dance]( Keep in mind this is just intent, as the release client of Segwit2x is not out, and is not scheduled to be until July 21st. 
I fully expect that if Segwit is activated under Segwit2x that small-blocker and Core co-opted parties will back out on the hardfork part, this will force a chain split come 3 months after Segwit activation, however to the extent of support on each side I can only speculate.

Is this an idea or is Bitmex or someone actually doing this?
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:47:52
Right, that's the beauty of Nakamoto Consensus, Bitcoin is a war of ideas, but in the end the free market finds the path of least resistance by means of economic and miner majority. If consensus can't be found, the market finds an alternative to replace the technology that cannot adapt.

45% explicitly support segwit, about 45% also explicitly support bigger blocks. 87% supposedly support Segwit2x, of course that is yet to be completely known until they are actually mining the client that will not be released until the 21st.
So there will be a fork, the question is which incentive is greater? The negative sentiment of the big scary hardfork, or the positive sentiment of a chain with double the capacity? If we are to believe the participants of the agreement hold their word (which I'm not saying we should, we should only believe the only metric that can be measured, hash rate), they will not back out of the hardfork come 3 months after SW activation. If every single miner of the 45% who explicitly supports segwit backs out on the hardfork, this will definitely make things interesting, but 55% is still enough of a majority to win out. Plus, the market is much more likely in my opinion to value a chain with more throughput higher than one with less, further coaxing miners to stay on the 2mb chain or switch back to it. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 23:16:00
No, he's correct. Anyone who opposes the hardfork part of Segwit2x can simply run the segwit2x client, wait for segwit to activate, then remove the blockheight activation of the hardfork from their client and still be a perfectly valid node. 
This means that those against a hard fork are not the ones risking their end of the deal being held up, as the soft fork will happen first and from there they are still free to mine 1MB blocks all they want and orphan any block larger than 1MB. This may not be wise, however, as the majority of miners signaling at the moment support larger blocks, meaning the 2MB chain will likely win out. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:32:20
You paid far too low of a fee (44.4 sat/byte). The current required fee to get in the next few blocks is about 300 sat/byte. According to  your transaction may never confirm before it is dropped from the mempool and returned to you (about 3 weeks). 
@_date: 2017-06-07 16:45:23
You don't decide what the better solution is, Nakamoto consensus does, and guess what, it hasn't decided. Maybe the NY agreement will hold up and it will go with segwit, maybe it won't. GTFO. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:23:45
You're right, there is a single signal for both, but that's not how it works my friend, one part is a softfork (Segwit) one part is a hardfork (2MB). That's why the agreement said, "Segwit after 80% signaling, then hardfork in September". 
No one is obliged to hard fork, even if a blockheight for the hardfork is coded into the segwit2x client, anyone could still remove it and still be running a perfectly valid client through the soft fork up until the point of the hardfork.

Trading is tough, it can be profitable but it normally takes some major losses to the learn lessons on how to be patient, or when to cut a loss. Really it just comes down to buy when everyone is selling, sell when everyone is buying, but that's easier said than done. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:28:04
Yes, that's what puzzles me as well, I don't think he would either.
But there is no way to guarantee a hardfork other than having the hashpower to do so. Bitmain and friends almost do have a majority on their own though, so maybe that's why he's agreed to sign. If he pushes segwit through and the others don't hold up their end of the agreement and follow through with the hardfork, he will fork without them with a majority hashpower and force the rest of the miners to follow or be re-orged. 
But also, an agreement really doesn't mean anything. In Bitcoin Nakamoto Consensus (miners) are the law, they have the final say.

It does mean voting, it's not the same as updating your phone, consensus is based off of the amount of work put into the chain, which entails having stake in the game and dedicating resources to said work. That is the intent and always has been. Miners make the chain, exchanges incentivize them to mine the most profitable one, if these interests are not aligned the miners are eventually forced to heed to the users wishes or else the market replaces the chain that can't adapt with one that can. 
I think your personal scaling solution that you've just said isn't bad at all actually, that seems like a good path. Personally I'd like to see a hardfork first and then Segwit or any other malleability fix, but of course this sort of disagreement on the path of things is why the consensus mechanism exists, to make sure the path that is eventually taken is a majority decision. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 03:28:24
With free electricity, the sooner the better in my opinion. Get in now as the long term trend of mining difficulty rising doesn't appear to be slowing. 
If you are concerned with fiat profits, I wouldn't bother, as the market can turn to the downside at any time, and it is already fairly overextended. 
If you want a steady stream of BTC regardless of the market price, mining is great for that, especially if you are not paying for power. If you believe in BTC in the long-run, there's no better way to support the network and passively generate BTC. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:52:25
Well, say for instance you buy a USB miner off ebay that hashes at 330Mh/s (or .00033Th/s). The total combined hashrate of the network right now is about 5,600,000Th/s. To find on average how many blocks it would take to find one with your 330Mh/s miner, divide your hashrate into the total network hashrate (5,600,000 / .00033). That works out to 16,969,696,969 blocks on average before you'd find one.
So at about 52560 blocks a year, it would take on average 322,863 years to find a block solo mining with that USB miner. 
Someone check my math, I think I did that right. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:31:34
There's no perfect number, but if the NY Agreement is to be believed, the consensus currently believes segwit2x is acceptable, and if that is the path of least resistance the market will follow it. If it is not, oh well, things will continue on as is until a breaking point is reached and either Bitcoin becomes irrelevant as a payment network, or forks to accommodate for that market. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:34:12
I know, I was throwing his argument back at him to show that it doesn't hold up. It works both ways, there is not consensus for a blocksize increase or segwit alone. There does appear to be consensus for both together, but only time will tell if that's the case.

were they really? That's nice, I know the mempool has been dropping down occassionally but I wasn't aware that 0 fee transactions had been getting picked up. Here's to hoping the mempool clears out again soon.

Ultimately the miners decide what code is run, there is no blockchain without them. There would be no exchanges without Bitcoin itself. You are correct however, that exchanges do incentivize the miners, not disagreeing with you there. If major exchanges come out en masse in support of BIP148, I'll eat my hat. I don't see that happening though when the risk involved is not worth it especially considering we haven't seen how the New York Agreement will play out. 
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:33:25

yes, immediately after the fork, as long as you hold the private keys, those private keys exist on the new fork.

Agreed, this is impossible to know with Bip148, however, so a MASF is the only way to guarantee this outcome. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 05:52:58
not disagreeing with that, which further enforces my point, they aren't going to mine a minority chain when their profits are so comfy on the current one. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:51:03
It may express your opinion but it has almost 0 significance on the market. Remember, miners have to run nodes (or the pools they operate on do). Those are the significant nodes, they are the ones setting the rules of the network. Your node that has no economic significance means nothing to the market. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 00:17:56
If you're going to do this at least buy a little USB ASIC so you don't kill your cpu/gpu. Also keep in mind, to solo mine you have to run a full node, this is going to eat your computer's and internet's resources up. To pool mine you don't need to run a node, they do that for you. 
But to answer your question, even with say a $50 USB asic miner, your chances of finding a block are probably worse than winning the powerball while simultaneously getting struck by lightning, three times in a row. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:35:25
The consensus mechanism isn't flawed just because you don't get your way.
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:23:28
And what are nodes without miners? Nothing.. A miner has to run a node, a node doesn't have to mine. A node on its own has no significance to the market other than providing a tiny extra bit of decentralization, or if that node is operating an economically significant service. You need more education in Bitcoin.


You are aware that Bitcoin has forked multiple times in the past right?  Is it not Bitcoin anymore because Satoshi didn't make it 100% perfect from version 1.0?
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:04:40


You can just stop there.
Bitcoin is what Bitcoin is. Its decentralization property is balanced between the sum of it's parts including the users, the economic players, and the miners.
The protocol (code) determines what the miners' job is and how much they get paid, currently that job is to find blocks, add transactions to block, and in return they receive a block reward and the associated transactions fees. 
And guess who enforces the rules of the protocol (code)? 


Is this how it works from where you're from? In my country if we don't like what we are doing or how much we get paid, we find a new job.

They're already freed up, no one is developing Bip148 anymore, it's done, it's just waiting to see if anyone will mine it come August 1st. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:23:22
There's either some real shady insider shit going on at Coinbase, or they simply can't handle the load. I kind of doubt the latter, they should have plenty of cash to keep their infrastructure adequate. 
However, after paying back those that got liquidated on that ETH flash crash, I don't know how they are doing it. Fractional reserve is likely at this point. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 06:17:59
Here's some math for you. Currently the only pool signaling intent to mine BIP148 after August 1st is Slush Pool, however not the entire pool (about 4.8% of the current total hashrate at the moment), but rather 3.43% of that pool, so that works out to about 0.16% of the total hashrate currently signaling that they will mine BIP148.
So let's be generous and say that this amount of miner support increases 60 times by August 1st, that would give them about  10% of the total hashrate. Let's also be generous and say a few of the major exchanges add BIP148 as a tradeable pair to their platforms. Currently none of the major exchanges have announced support, but this might change. 
So now August 1st rolls around, a few exchanges are now trading the minority chain, and they've credited trader's accounts with an identical amount of UASF coins as they have Bitcoins on balance. An hour goes by, no blocks have been found on the minority chain, traders get nervous and start to dump their UASF coins for Bitcoin, dumping the price of a UASF coin to a small fraction of Bitcoin. From here, a few hours go by and the miners mining the BIP148 chain realize they are making a small fraction of what they were on the main chain, actually most of them have made nothing as only a couple blocks have been found. Half of them switch back to the main chain so they don't lose any more profits. The cycle continues as block times get slower and slower for the minority chain as miners continue to abandon it for the majority chain. Within a few days the UASF chain has no miners left and is delisted from exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:57:31

When it comes to UASF, it is a certainty. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 19:31:23
correct, this means that only users with balance on exchange will be able to create a market for UASF, as presumably the exchanges (if any actually decide to hop on board) will split the coins for the users and provide them with a 1:1 balance on both chains. From there I don't think it's that hard to say what will happen, the market will price in the shorter and less functional chain accordingly, many will be happy to sell their USAF coins for any price, as that will net them more BTC before the UASF chain is deserted. Because miners are not going to wait for the new coins (that is if they even find any blocks) to be able to hit exchange, they will reduce their risk by switching their hash power back to the longest chain once it is evident that their efforts are fruitless. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:48:07

@_date: 2017-06-15 02:48:17

@_date: 2017-06-07 07:11:53
That's actually not what I'm suggesting, rather the opposite. The free market has to accommodate for its users, that's its function.  
You'll see soon that the free market will actually allow the fee costs to "fix" themselves to accommodate for the average user, that's the glory of this ecosystem. The market's participants incentivize the miners, and the miners decide accordingly how to accommodate for the market. A very beautiful perpetual cycle. 
If the market participants do want Bitcoin to be more than just a store of wealth and settlement layer, but also a competitive payment network, the miners will eventually have to heed to their wishes or Bitcoin will continue to bleed its marketshare away to alts, and that will be that. If that's how it has to be, well that's unfortunate in my opinion, but the free market will prevail. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 23:01:34
Forking off the main chain and hoping the majority of the miners follow (having no idea if they will) is reckless. They have to have economic majority on their side for the miners to have incentive to follow that chain. Large economic players realize this slippery slope, and they are doing the sane thing currently by simply ignoring those who want to blindly jump off a cliff.
You can't just "activate it now", you can try, but when no one mines your chain and blocks are never found preventing a difficulty adjustment from ever happening, your chain is functionless and worthless. 
@_date: 2017-06-30 22:35:56


That's bullshit and you know it. There's multiple different clients competing for hash power right now. What do you think the non-core clients just appeared out of no where? Did some evil ghost code them?
There definitely is one side who is demanding, threatening, and bluffing. All three of those attributes describe UASF Bip148 perfectly.  They demand you use their client "or else", they threaten if you don't you will not be a part of Bitcoin, when in reality it's all a bluff because no one entity decides what Bitcoin is, it's up to the miners to decide who's code they will run, and it's up to the market to incentivise the miners to chose the right path. 
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:26:02
That's how Bitcoin works. Don't worry though, if Bitcoin doesn't get its shit together there's plenty of alternatives that the market will replace it with. Satoshi's vision will never die. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 05:46:44
It may be your opinion that Bitcoin needs second layers and innovation, but the market may not decide that is what Bitcoin should be. If it does great, I won't complain, I think your vision is completely legitimate, and it's obvious there's a place in the market for that sort of thing as we see Eth doing so well. 
However, Bitcoin may still have immense value if for nothing else as "A peer-to-peer electronic cash" as described in the whitepaper. It may be very well that Ether has already won out on innovation front, and that Bitcoin doesn't have to be innovative at all to have value, it just has to be trustless, immutable, and store wealth effectively. Ideally it would also function as an affordable payment network. 
@_date: 2017-07-13 22:04:32
I wouldn't be so sure of that. Remember, those with the largest sums of money invested into this ecosystem aren't always the most vocal. 
There's no way to quantify the real will of the users, as there's no way to poll every user in a non Sybil-able way (not to mention there's no way to get every user to vote in the first place). 
This is the problem that Bitcoin solves with proof of work. There is way to see what the mining nodes support, as proof-of-work is not subject to sybil attacks. Right now 45% of the miners support segwit on its own, this is the only real metric we have, and that is not a vast majority. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:55:53
Honestly I think Trezor is fine, but unnecessary.
My personal method of choice is distributed (copies of) BIP38 encrypted paper wallets, costs next to nothing (just the price of the paper), and these encrypted keys can also be safely stored on digital devices as well for redundancy as they are encrypted and safe as long as your password is strong. 
I think you're being a bit paranoid with your printer tbh, I mean it never hurts to be safe but the chances of your printer being compromised are really next to nil. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 07:14:01
That's simply not true. If every single person really thought the status quo sucked they'd sell their coins, and we wouldn't be at all time highs. 
Let's be real, we're banking off this ride, even if BTC isn't where we thought it would be on the scaling issue, it's still got massive hype behind it. And a lot of this new money doesn't even care what Bitcoin is, they just know they can make a quick buck.
The consensus mechanism is not flawed, it can just take a very long time to find a solution when the community is so split. Will it take a major market crash to make miners capitulate into coming to consensus? It might, but what also might make consensus rapidly expedite is losing, or coming close to losing it's spot as the  marketcap cryptocoin. It could still be at all-time-highs and likely will be if this happens, as the big chunk of the new money is flowing from Bitcoin to Poloniex to buy ETH, but if it BTC loses it's  spot, that might just be enough incentive to find consensus. Either way, it will be found, even if it means another years long brutal downtrend to incentivize miners.

There's a couple different things you can do to get quick access to those coins.
First is to boot up that old laptop, open up Bitcoin core, and then export the private keys. From there you can import them into any other wallet, such as an SPV wallet that doesn't require you to download the whole blockchain.
You can also do the same thing by finding the wallet.dat file on the hard drive and importing that into a new wallet.

It's not consensus without the miners, the actual number that matters.

It doesn't need a citation, it's simple logic on how this market operates. There are better alternatives than supporting a reckless fork, the market is responding accordingly. Things could change, but why would they when there's already multiple proposals that don't risk a major chain split? If all the exchanges just ignore it, it's a non-event. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:39:55
A chain split is irrelevant when none of the markets support it to incentivize miners, that means the smaller chain dies very quickly, that is how bitcoin works.
As a stakeholder in bitcoin, and not a miner or economically significant business, the only say we have is with the stake we have in Bitcoin. We can sell it and cause the market price to drop and thus incentivize miners to bend to the will of the market. But listen to the market in its current condition, is it making miners capitulate? No, it's not.. If Bitcoin was at $300 right now with the same block reward things would be much different, I'd actually probably be for a UASF and exchanges would too, but a UASF wouldn't even be necessary, miners would listen and a hardfork would be the path of least resistance. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:10:42
see my edit on my first post, currently a good setting would be to click "Custom" and set it to .003. This would get your tx in the next block or at the worst a few after. The way you have it is fine as well, but you could save a little bit by bumping it down to .003 even and still get it confirmed quickly. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:50:05
Definitely not disagreeing with you there, the question is, how much of the hashpower is actually going to stay loyal to a hardfork? Sure they can lie all they want right now and say they've submitted to the "compromise" but as soon as Segwit activates I would be more surprised if Bitfury and other Core co-opted miners do not back out. If even a decent minority back out, the rest of the majority will as well as they don't want a chain split. Or maybe they do want a chainsplit and will have the balls to fork off with a slim majority, I guess only time will tell.  
@_date: 2017-07-13 23:37:54
Yes, you are correct, and as of right now Bip148 doesn't change the PoW, but Luke has expressed his intent to change the PoW when it inevitably fails to become the longest valid chain. Who knows, maybe he'll change his mind if Segwit activates before August 1st, or he'll probably at least postpone the PoW change until the Segwit2x hardfork.

yeah, you can keep using that setting instead just fine, where you have it is pretty good, you can see it's showing .00352852 btc/kB which is just a little bit more than the .003 that I recommended at the moment. You either use that time target setting, or the custom setting, not both. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:27:49
I think it's more likely there will be 3 different chains, at least temporarily until two of them die out. The current chain, a Segwit chain (Bip148), and a big blocks chain. From there it would be most probable that the current chain and Segwit chain dies off in favor of the big blocks chain. 
Of course, I think more likely than that is there is no chain split at all. Either by means of Segwit2x succeeding, or by means of it falling through and miners too scared to fork off. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 08:55:50
No, there really isn't, LOOK, put down the kool-aid. Name more than one major economic player who supports it, go on.. Give me written proof of miners who have pledged to mine it, and no don't link me Slush pool's miniscule 4% of their pool which works out to a whopping 0.2% of the total network.

Node count is irrelevant to its success, nodes must be economically relevant (IE: run by major exchanges and wallet providers). It is a failed idea from the start, however, as the major exchanges fear subverting the miners who have the final say in which chain survives. Because of this risk, no major exchange is likely to support it, and thus it is DOA.

Don't try to pretend you run a full node currently on your .4Mbps up connection, that means 1MB is already very taxing if not impossible for you. I also have .4Mbps up and I use Bitcoin like the rest of us just fine, I use a SPV wallet like majority of us. 
Segwit is also not 2MB, that is patently false, stop spreading lies. To raise the blocksize a hardfork is required, which segwit is not. Yes, segwit does make more room within a block, but it does not make it 2MB.
@_date: 2017-06-04 20:58:00
You are largely correct, I'd expect some sizeable selling coming August 1st due to uncertainty, but probably nothing that will cause a major crash. Likely will be a good time to buy, but who knows today's prices could be cheaper. 
@_date: 2017-06-23 22:43:42
If it comes to that, that is if Segwit2x does not successfully activate Segwit before August 1st. There's a few possibilities of what could happen on/after August 1st, listed from most to least likely (in my opinion). note: these are not the only possibilities. 
1. Pretty much nothing. No major exchange decides to add it, therefore there's no incentive to mine it, Bitcoin continues on as is without Segwit and the Bip148 chain dies due to no blocks being found.
2. It does get some traction, some miners fork off to it, in response other miners who have opted for big blocks (about 45-50% of them) start mining another separate chain with big blocks. From there it will be a bloody battle to see who wins out, but the big blocks chain will likely win out killing off the Bip148 and legacy (current) chain
3. Many major exchanges add Bip148, it gets substantial support and obtains majority hashrate, thus wiping out the legacy chain. Segwit activates and Luke-Jr and friends celebrate. 
Of course, the most likely scenario at the moment is that Segwit2x does activate Segwit before August 1st, and the Bip148 fear-mongering has still done its job as its end goal has been accomplished, even though it had no part in doing so other than scaring the miners into mining Segwit2x.

Actually it's the "altcoin" Jeff Garzik is working on. Which (apparently) has consensus among 80%+ of the economic and mining majorities. Of course I won't say it's a sure thing until the release client is out and those miners actually signal for it on Bit 4. 
Personally I hope it falls through and you guys get to fork off come August 1st. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 17:41:17

Can't have an economic majority of a coin without a blockchain, can't have a blockchain without miners. They need each other, but the miners make the chain.

Yes, it's baffling to me that big block miners have seemingly conceded to Core's wishes. It makes even less sense that Core would be against Segwit2x, as it gives them everything they want and potentially nothing the big blockers want. 
I don't think it's so cut and dry, however. When analyzed from a more critical perspective, it's not that hard to see what those in the Segwit camp are doing. First they push Segwit onto the miners, who majorily reject it. When that fails they then set an ultimatum (Bip148), those who understand the incentive structure of this market can easily see that on its own Bip148 is very unlikely to succeed. 
But, with the looming threat of Bip148, it is used as leverage to create a "compromise" which we now see as Segwit2x. Now if Core supported this "compromise" it would be largely rejected by the miners, so instead they pretend to hate it, thus garnering what appears to be overwhelming support. It's a very dirty tactic, and very similar to what was used to pass the Federal Reserve Act of 1913. 
The real question is now, have the miners caught onto this trick? They've pledged support, but when it comes down to it all that matters is that they actually mine the Segwit2x client when it is released. It's possible they have caught on, and while they are pledging support at the moment, they are thinking a few moves ahead and may be planning to force a chain split instead.

I don't think we can say that miner signaling is a broken system just yet. 
The fact of the matter is that the Bitcoin market price is at all-time-highs, meaning the demand for people wanting BTC is higher than the supply from users giving up on BTC and selling because of high tx fees. What this tells us is that the market values BTC for speculation and a store of wealth more than it does as a payment network. This isn't really news, it's been this way since BTC exchanges first popped up. 
Of course, I'm sure I'm not alone when I say I want to see BTC succeed as a payment network, but that will come with time. And I may be wrong, but it looks like miner signaling is going to prevail and allow this. Segwit2x just hit the testnet, any day now miners will start signaling for it. If the bit 4 signaling hits the 80% threshold, and the Segwit MASF happens, will you still say signaling is a broken system? 
This has been a big struggle the past few years to find a path to scale, Bitcoin is a war of ideas and we can't expect everyone to get on the same page quickly. In the end the market finds the path of least resistance, even if it takes years. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 10:17:02

Bitcoin processes transactions in blocks. On average a block is processed (mined) every 10 minutes.
Now imagine each block as a bus. There's thousands of people at the bus stop, but a bus only comes around only every 10 minutes. The buses can only fit so many people and the bus drivers don't charge a flat fee to ride, but rather whoever offers to pay the most can get on the bus first. 
You can check what the required fee is at the current point in time to get your transaction into the next block: 
edit: note these are in satoshis per byte, your "custom setting" on bitcoin core allows you to set BTC per kilobyte, so currently a good setting to put no the Custom option in Bitcoin core to get your TX picked up in the next block or at most a few later would be about .003 BTC per kilobyte (converts to 300 satoshis per byte. 1 satoshi is the smallest unit of Bitcoin or .00000001 BTC)
@_date: 2017-06-22 02:42:45
You can try that, but from what I understand the current node software running the network won't allow you to try and double spend it.
There is a way to make a child pays for parent transaction to tack on a higher fee, but I've never tried that before and it's a bit beyond me. I think it should be technically possible since you have control over both the sending and receiving wallet, but maybe not with Exodus.

So do you actually know of miners just sitting around idle waiting to mine a minority chain come August 1st?
Also, it's looking likely that there will be a difficulty adjustment just before August 1st, if this is the case then there will be close to a full 2016 blocks to be mined before the next adjustment. I suppose the UASF chain could get lucky and mining could start on it a few blocks before a difficulty adjustment, which would be convenient for them, but it's looking just as likely that they'll start mining right after a difficulty adjustment as well.

Miners create that certainty, that is their function, to perpetuate the longest chain and in return receive block rewards and tx fees. It's not relevant as to what they want, as that is fundamentally what Bitcoin is, what I am discussing is how they come to those decisions. The answer, of course, is the market gives them incentive to serve the users. 
I do agree that Segwit2x is not a sure thing by any means. I also believe that Bip148 success is far less of a probable outcome. The only thing incentivizing miners to change right now is that they  have had to start realizing that the primary use case of Bitcoin has become to buy/trade altcoins. Other than that looming realization, they are more than content with the all-time-high market price and ridiculous fees. The question is, will this realization be enough on its own to force miners to a majority consensus before Bitcoin is overtaken by an alternative? Or will it take BTC losing its number one spot for miners to capitulate, eventually coming to a decision that enables the market to continue to significantly value it? 
The magnitude of the situation is increasing, and I think the major economic players know this. The do or die moment is rapidly approaching. It is not important if you or I trust the Core devs, or any devs for that matter. This system is designed to be trustless, it is what makes it so revolutionary. It is up to the miners to decide whose code they run, and the market will either find the path of least resistance by giving miners enough incentive to fork, or Bitcoin will simply be overtaken and replaced by competitors who can better suit the market's needs.

I want to say Coinbase is not currently doing GBP deposits or withdrawals at the moment, which is likely why the transfer credited you in Euros.
If you SEPA transfer back to your bank, I believe the conversion fee will be based on whatever bank you use, from what I'm seeing normal fee is about 2.5%.
Also, you don't want to be trading on the GBP side of the GDAX exchange anyway, as the liquidity and volume is garbage compared to EUR and USD.
I would suggest trading in the USD market if it allows you to on GDAX, if not then the EUR market. Then, when it comes time to take profit, transfer the BTC from GDAX back to Coinbase, then sell the BTC on Coinbase back to your bank account, you may be forced to use SEPA again if GBP withdrawals are still disabled.

Have you considered the point of the 2MB hard fork is to give the average user a choice between being able to affordably use bitcoin to transact directly on chain, or to use a middleman (LN) enabled by segwit? Of course LN will be cheaper and faster which will make it appealing to most users, but pricing these users out of being able to transact directly on chain goes against the principles that bitcoin was founded on. 
I don't have a problem with people using LN if they want to, but they should have the choice and not be forced to use it just because on-chain fees are otherwise too expensive. Otherwise, that is just creating an unnecessary problem for the sole means of being able to profit off of it, which is all sorts of unethical and wrong. 
@_date: 2017-06-07 01:39:41
It has happened, thousands of times over with little tweaks and changes here and there.
The market values Bitcoin more than any of these other implementations because it has the largest and most secure network, largely due to it being the first of its kind. 
Simply starting a Bitcoin clone with no unique changes has no appeal to the market, and thus no appeal to miners to secure it. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 22:13:42


This is blatantly misleading, the 80%+ that have pledged support Segwit2x, a MASF, not a UASF. This is why there's still next to no economic or miner support for Bip148, and why this will continue to be the case. This majority they speak of have agreed to Segwit MASF, and they will not jeopardize the success of this plan by abandoning it for a reckless attempt at accomplishing the same thing.


This is the most likely scenario at the moment, don't take my word for it, look at where the economic and miner support currently is for it. No major exchange has announced support, and currently the only metric we have on miner support is Slush pool's ~5% userbase that is signaling to mine the Bip148 chain come August 1st, this works out to about 1/4th of a percent of the total network hashrate.

Their job is to secure the network and process transactions, that is how it has been and always will be. They decide what they get paid based of the rules of the protocol (which they enforce by majority), currently the block reward is 12.5 BTC. 
The market is there to determine what the Bitcoin are worth in terms of other currencies, but remember that Bitcoin existed before there even was a market for it. If the market demand dries up because the miners are not following the wishes of its users, then the market price falls incentivizing miners to change to the wishes of the users.

It's a shame the core developers didn't heed his words of advice, if they did I have no doubt miners would have followed suit. Alas, greed is a powerful thing. Why go with the simple solution when you can over-engineer one that allows for you to profit from transactions fees by the means of a middleman, without actually having to secure the network itself by mining? And some still wonder why the miners aren't in agreement..
@_date: 2017-06-11 15:06:27


Because the conditions for that activation haven't been met, if they had it would already be activated.
If you are fine with 2MB, which is a pre-requisite for supporting segwit2x, why not activate it now via the currently active deployment procedure?
Is it possible that, for unknown reasons, you only want to get the Segwit soft fork through and try to tack it onto something everyone wants? Because you can't argue for it independently?
See, I can use circular reasoning and beg the question as well, that doesn't change the fact that neither the economic or miner majority is in favor of Bip141 or Bip148 on its own. The agreement says they are willing to compromise with both Segwit and a 2MB hard fork, I'm hopeful for that but it's yet to be seen as the segwit2x client is not quite complete and thus signaling hasn't begun for it. 


Why are the largest chunk of miners still signaling for EC or Bip100? Maybe because most miners do support larger blocks, and actually most of the signers of the NY agreement have supported bigger blocks even before agreeing to the compromise. Once the Segwit2x client is finished we'll see how signaling changes, if the word of the participants of the NYA is to believed, 80% signaling will be reached quickly.

We have to see first if the claimed 80%+ majority will signal for segwit2x once the client is released. 
The 2MB block size increase doesn't just "go in to effect" without miner support either, it requires a hard fork. Because the segwit part of segwit2x is a soft fork, it will be much easier to push through. It's more likely the segwit portion will happen and the 2MB hard fork won't than the other way around. 
@_date: 2017-06-25 06:33:21
Haven't personally used the S9 before, but I've had experience mining in the past, both GPU and ASIC. 
ASICs are much less work, you simply need the unit and a power supply, and they are generally more stable than GPUs as well. Plus, you've got to pay some very inflated prices on GPUs right now. Also with GPUs, if you are mining to trade for BTC, you have to micromanage what coins you are mining.
Approximating your mining returns in USD terms is very difficult, there's no way to say what the market price will be in the future.
What's a little easier to approximate is difficulty changes. According to [BitcoinWisdom]( it's looking like the next difficulty adjustment may be under 1%, this is quite low compared to the past few changes, so if you were able to get a hold of an S9 within the next 20 days (before the difficulty change after next) it looks like the calculators such as [this one]( are likely to be pretty accurate for the first month (at least for BTC returns). As far as what the price of BTC will be a month from now, or three months, or a year, your guess is as good as mine. 
@_date: 2017-06-04 00:19:44
That's not exactly what's happening. On aug 1st a minority chain goes live, maybe if they are luckily a few exchanges will add this new coin to their markets (that is if they don't get 51% attacked out of existence first). As far as price speculation, the minority chain initially will probably be priced around their percentage of hash-rate in comparison to the majority chain.
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:16:51
I wouldn't be so sure of the other suggestions having little progress. The Segwit2x client is not ready yet, but coming close. It could be very well that miners will signal for it on bit 4 when the client is released, and Segwit will still happen. Of course I can't see the future, but if we are to believe the NY agreement this will be the case. 
A UASF on its own is not inherently bad, it can work, and has in the past. Bip148 is very risky however, as it doesn't have a majority support rallied behind it on either side. If it had large economic support it would be a different story.
You can't argue that segwit hasn't been contentious, and for good reason, the current 95% threshold on Bip9 is just unrealistic when there's any sort of opposition. 
I do have hope for the NY agreement, and it looks like the economic majority does to, they've compromised and will take segwit along with a 2mb blocksize bump (at least according to the agreement they have signed). The Segwit2x client is close to alpha release. I think we actually will see the 80% bit 4 threshold reached by miner signaling soon after the client is released. This might even actually happen before August 1st, meaning Bip148 won't even be needed. 
All I'm saying, is listen to what the market is telling you. We have a good chance to end this stalemate soon by actual consensus, not just by forking off and praying everyone follows.

It could be BitClub, or the BitCrew, something like that. I do like the idea, I may have to start my own BTC club whenever I go to university, I don't think I'd have much luck at my community college. 
I'd start by just educating people about the subject and offering them to attend your first meeting where you will set them up with a wallet and give them a complimentary dollar or two in BTC. 
You could also get a small mining unit (even a USB miner) and  demonstrate how the mining process works, which will clarify a lot of questions people may have. 
The club could end up turning into a mini exchange. Once people get their first bitcoins they will watch the price and won't be able to help but notice the price likely climbing quite a bit over weeks and months time. The club will make it easy to exchange fiat for bitcoins if they wish as there will likely be members who want to buy more, and some who will want to cash out their coins because they are broke college kids.
You could also incorporate competitions/tournaments with BTC as the reward. Pick a video game that is popular among the group, for example, and charge a small entry fee. You can keep a small percent of the entry fees for the club wallet, and award the rest as prizes.

Paypal won't do it, but maybe eBay could adopt a "receiving bitcoin address" box when buying bitcoin. This way, if the blockchain shows the BTC has been sent to the address, no chargebacks can be filed. Easy as that?

The miners, exchanges, and user all make up the market. They are all fighting each other, yes, and that's unfortunate but that doesn't change the fundamentals of how the system works. It didn't used to be this way because the devs and miners were on the same page, but that has changed. You can't blame the miners for not wanting to run the developers code. It's a war of ideas, and the best eventually pervails, and if it not the blockchain is abandoned for a more effective one. 
If Asicboost turns out to be a real problem, and not just some boogeyman propaganda, then Bitcoin will just die and be abandoned, simple as that, or at least the market will make the miners capitulate into patching it by tanking the price. There won't be much value in a centralized blockchain, and the market will react accordingly. 
@_date: 2017-06-09 20:56:30
It is an option, of course, you can't deny that. And it can cure it, if miners aren't making profit they either adapt or give up, it's not a complicated concept. If they give up, the broader market simply finds a better alternative. We can see this is already happening anyway as Bitcoin has bled marketshare to alts excessively this year.
But you do make a fair point. If price continues to rise others will want in on the mining. I do hope that another major manufacture does pop up soon that can compete with Bitmain, that would be great, as when it comes down to it the miners make the chain, the economic majority can only influence them by incentive (price in relation to other currency/goods). 
Either way, the system corrects itself, which is the beauty of it. It may take a long time for the market to find the path of least resistance, but it will eventually. Satoshi's vision is eternal and will never die, but it may manifest itself in different forms.

I love BTC but there are some advantages to the other coins. Will they profit as much long term? maybe not but I feel at this point in time they are gaining a lot of ground, people are hearing about bitcoin and not wanting to pay the price if there's a cheaper alternative. It's all about the demand and the demand for alt coins has spiked recently.It may just be a fad, but I got in on the recent LTC rush and made out good.

At the moment if you pay no fee (or way too low of one), there's next to no chance your transaction will ever get picked up, as there's too many people that are paying fees (and high ones at that). Transactions that are waiting to get picked up are put in what's called the mempool (the bus stop for this analogy), if your transaction sits in this mempool for more than 3 weeks it is discarded from the mempool, and your transaction is effectively canceled and your coins will show back up as spendable. 
You can check what the current fee size per byte is to get your transaction processed quickly at this site:

The amount of BTC generated is fairly predictable, much more so than what that BTC will be worth in $ terms. However, every two weeks the mining difficulty adjusts (almost always up), on average right now the difficulty changes about 3-5% every change, this means you'll mine 3-5% less BTC for that period than you did at the start. 
Setting up an ASIC miner is not very difficult, you just need an adequate power supply, adequate power from the wall, and then to point the miner to a pool so you can be paid out the reward. From there you can withdraw from the pool to a local wallet, most pools even have an auto-withdraw feature so you don't have to worry about that.

I'm diversified into a few different leading alts, I won't say which ones as I'm not trying to promote them, but I'll just say none of them are ETH :D. Half of my crypto porftolio is still BTC. Honestly, I don't expect alts to act as a hedge at all, they'll probably get hit harder than any of the BTC chains themselves, but I'm holding them for the long run.
I'm riding it out, I'm done trading for the moment, so I'm very happy to be able to have coins on whichever forks may exist, and then at that point I will be very happy to sell the coins on the forks that don't align with my values for the fork that does. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:47:11
a. There's many factors, it may or may not be, you are taking a gamble. The more mining power added to the network, the harder it is for miners to find blocks of coins. This means your miners will produce less and less in BTC terms as time goes on, however if the price in $ goes up proportionally or more, you still make profit.
b. For BTC mining you need specialized machines (ASICs). There's really only one competitive unit on the market right now, the Antminer S9. You also need adequate power supplies and circuit breakers. Miners use loads of power, so the cheaper your electricity is, the less your power bill will cut into profits.
You can also mine coins other than BTC, for this you don't need special ASICS, you can use graphics cards. Right now, because GPU mining is profitable, graphics card prices are inflated. It's also a lot more work to set up GPU miners as you need all the other desktop PC components to run them, and you also have to micromanage what coins you are mining as their profitability changes constantly. I mean you don't have to mine more than one coin, but if your goal is to be able to trade for BTC, you'll want to mine the coin that is most profitable in BTC terms. 
If you don't have $2000 or more to invest in mining hardware, I wouldn't really bother, unless you already have a desktop laying around that you can throw a GPU or two in. Even better if you already have a good GPU or two that you aren't using, in that case there's no reason not to mine on it (or just sell the GPUs and buy Bitcoin with that money). 
@_date: 2017-06-07 09:18:56
It looks like Bitfury has already wussied out, as they haven't mined any blocks with bip148 in their coinbase for months. Wallet operators are a good start, but the major exchanges carry the large bulk of the weight on the economic side, after all there's got to be a liquid market for a coin for the market to give it any sort of decent value. 
Who knows, you may be right, time will tell, maybe major exchanges and miners will hop on board, I just don't see it as the likely scenario. 
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:38:56
I'd say both. Mining is better for the long term in my opinion, as it supports the network, and it's likely (unless difficulty shoots way up) that you'll eventually earn more coin than you could have bought today for the same price (priced in that coin, not $). Of course if you have expensive electricity, it may not be worth it, but an ASIC unit will most likely make you profit in BTC terms (you never know what that BTC will be worth in $, but if you are in it for the long haul you are not selling anyway). 
It appears ASIC miners are at a point now where they aren't getting much faster, but continue to get marginally more efficient. Compared to the past, where you'd order an ASIC, and by the time you received it there were already units on the market that were much faster and efficient.

This would be great, but if this happens it will shatter their illusion of support as the UASF futures token trades for a small fraction of Bitcoin's price.

And if they're really smart they'll continue to ignore it, making it a non-event. If that's the case the only people affected will be those miners who decide to throw their hashing power away for a while before they realize the mistake they've made. 
But who knows, maybe this sybil attack will be successful, personally I believe the market is more robust than to allow that to happen. Either way, the longest chain will prevail, or the UASFers will decide to hard-fork their minority chain to lower the difficulty and change the proof of work, then the market will price that new altcoin in accordingly (hint, it won't be worth much). 
@_date: 2017-06-26 01:49:06
That's one way to do it, but does add additional risk. My strategy is not to add to losers, only winners, however both can work if played on the right timeframe. 
Margin is good tool, but in my opinion it shouldn't be used to extend your bankroll past what you actually have, but rather used in order to trade a position size of what you actually have, but with less capital on the line. 
Ideally, you have a better edge not using margin at all, as you don't need to pay lending fees or be forced to close out a position on a futures contract due to expiration. However, margin can of course multiple potential profit or loss in a shorter timeframe.

Right, it would definitely help for now, no doubt, but more room is still needed to keep tx fees at a sane level.

That node is irrelevant if the underlying network of miners does not follow its rules. Nodes enforce the rules, but miners decide which nodes they want the their product (BTC in this case) to use. 
The best say the average user has is not to run a node, although there's nothing wrong with doing so as it does help decentralize the network.
Now the miners are incentivized by the market, of course, they don't want to produce a worthless product. So what can the average user (who does not want to mine) do to influence this market? Well, the only thing they can really do is either buy the product the miners are producing, creating demand, or abandon (sell) the product they are producing, creating supply. If demand dries up, price drops, and miners are forced to either capitulate and heed the market's (user's) wishes, or simply give up and stop mining as it is no longer profitable. 
Of course, if you don't own much Bitcoin, you can't move the market hardly at all, but that's how the market works, the more stake you have in the product, the more influence you have on the market. Simple economics.

I want more transaction capacity, of course, but I believe there's better alternatives than eventually forcing transactions through a middleman and siphoning the tx fees, the simple solution is just to increase on-chain space, do it in a gradual way where it doesn't outpace the advancement of technology so nodes can still be easily run on affordable hardware. If that isn't possible, and only then, should a middleman/second layer be necessary. There's no need to over-complicate things now just because a company is hungry to provide a solution to a problem that should have never existed if Satoshi's advice was heeded.

Bullshit, whoever has the most stake in the market has the most say on what Bitcoin is.

This is the closest thing we've ever had to a free market, appreciate it for what it is and wake up from the delusion. When a tiny fraction of the miners decide to fork off to a new chain, you can't blame everyone else who ignores it and rightfully continues on the longest chain making August 1st a non-event to everyone other than the few who lost out on their block rewards by making a stupid mistake.

windows 7 actually does have shadow copies of the files through system restore points. You don't actually perform a system restore, but you use a utility to to extract the earlier copies of the files that do not have the encryption on them. Like I said, only practical if you don't have any vital information on the PC that you just obtained.

I'd wager there's no way for the law to interfere as I would think when the law refers to gambling it implies it is tied to an established currency. I know there are some physical gaming establishments that use tokens to get around this so maybe using BTC is a similar workaround? 
I'd say at the very least you can host the site on an overseas server and not disclose nationality of the website at all.

And this is how localbitcoins.com vendors make good dough. All you need is a level 2 coinbase account to start making profit off of coins.

It's a bad idea long term but chances are if you do a good martingale run once you will be up. But once is easier said than done.

that seems a bit steep for liquidating only 5% of the market

It's costing you the life of your computer. Running your GPU at full force all day for, what, a few cents a month?

This is exactly what I do. There is only one problem. With the way the price is increasing, you'll likely get the notification that someone wants to buy too late, because the price they placed the order at could be much lower than the current market price. Let's say someone places an order at $813.50 (including your 13.5%). Now let's say you get the email 2 hours later, by this time the price is at $850 not including your 13.5%. If a case like this occurs, you're forced to ask the buyer to cancel his/her order and wait until the actual time of meeting to make a new one in order to assure they are getting exactly what they are paying for and you aren't loosing money replenishing your stock at a higher price than you are selling for.

Same thing happened to me recently, luckily with only about 1.5 btc, I learned my lesson quickly and enabled 2 factor

Hey really appreciate the tip, I was waiting for hours for it to show up on my CC and it didn't, tried my debit card and it was instant. Cheers!

Yes murder is wrong. First off the guy who claimed to make public thousands of names was probably an FBI agent. If this dialogue released is even real and not planted by the FBI, then if I was DPR I don't think I would have done anything different (other than encrypting these sensitive messages, which I believe the real DPR would not have forgot to do).
Actually, he probably did encrypt these messages, and the receiving ends were both probably FBI agents. Fuck them.

I've been looking into doing this and was also interested in margin trading through bitfinex.com but their site has been under high loads and lagging out frequently. 
I guess I can do the math, but what amount did you start with trading? Small amounts don't seem to be very profitable with transaction fees

I'm saying if you do not purchase bitcoins from a US exchange, or if you don't get them through an exchange at all.
