So Trezor or Ledger then. Everyone seems to say, it's either that, or a paper wallet (whatever that is), or a dummy pc. 
Is that it then? I have to invest first to buy Bitcoins, because it's the only way to have a secure wallet.
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:42:01
So a paper wallet is simply a master key saved offline right? On Paper
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:41:41
Awesome Great reply! Thank you :)
@_date: 2015-03-01 11:01:22
I like your style :)
My first step in learning was coming here, just to trawl for knowledge. I'll keep doing that, reading more about the FAQ, and comparing the different companies.
But I really really like your philosophy, it is similar to my own, of just getting everything done on my own :)
I like you tastypic!
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:42:49
Lol no I don't believe that :D , but I don't feel the data would be safe on my phone which is unencrypted. 
What would you recommend I do Ninja. I'm leaning to save up for the Trezor, and just use that. 
I really would like another elegant software solution, but I can't seem to find a better way to keep my wallet safe AND buy bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 10:59:47
Can you explain the 12 words? I don't know what you mean.
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:09:56
Are you saying the market is already cornered?
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:46:13
So one day the Bitcoin market will be cornered is what you're saying :( That makes me less want to use it as a form of payment or investment. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:59:12
I saw their video. What is the downside of using a paper wallet?
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:10:43
I need a wallet first. I'm unsure of how to setup a wallet, because I don't have a spare computer to protect my master key. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 11:24:43
I'm leaning towards Trezor or Ledger wallet. Ledger is much cheaper, so seems like my first choice.
Any downsides or pitfalls to the above 2 choices? Any negative costs?
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:19:26
I can't think of any illegal products I'd want to be honest.
My issue is, I want full control of my wallet. It seems coinbase won't allow that, unless you have them send funds to your own wallet.
My biggest issue, I don't know how to secure a wallet, WITHOUT needing a dummy computer... :( 
I also don't want to buy Trezor, although it looks great. It's just too pricey. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 03:57:21
Yep I've learned a lot on that website. 
But from what I've read here, there is only 1 way to keep your wallet safe, which is having your master key on another computer; that or buying special hardware like trezor. 
Both are not possible for me at this moment, so it's making me a bit disappointed; I don't know where to go from here. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 09:24:59
What does it mean to make a copy of the key? Have 2 master keys?
@_date: 2015-03-01 11:59:49
Sounds great! Any downsizes to Trezor? Can it be hacked fairly easily?
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:14:23
I really feel like I should be in charge of my wallet. Should I let bitgo do it instead? If so how can I trust them?
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:26:25
Yea, this has shown me NOT to use coinbase, EXCEPT to buy Bitcoins. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:07:08
You wouldn't buy it at once. You'd buy slowly, strategically, and negotiate with people to buy large chunks. 
To corner a market, having as little as 5-10% of total supply is sufficient. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:43:24
So how is a multi security wallet like Greenaddress safer than coinbase btw? Just so I can get a chance to learn more about them.
Is there a central network that has access to the info?
@_date: 2015-03-01 11:16:53
I think most people that have a in depth knowledge of wall street would laugh at that.
Also you might want to research the whole London Libor Scandal: 
Another example is JP Morgan's successful cornering of the Gold market:
Also JP Morgan and Aliminum Anti trust case:
The markets are cornered all the time. It just takes some digging to find the scandals.
How can BitCoin avoid this? If it can't... why should anyone invest in Bitcoin or use it as a safe storage? 
@_date: 2015-03-02 03:55:50
Very very good explanations here, and thank you for them.
But I still don't understand what you mean by multi-signature wallet. How do you control signatures and how is this different than a default wallet? Is a normal wallet 1 signature? 
I'm also worried about securing my wallet. It seems the only way to secure it is to a have a dedicated PC and have it in a cold vault that way, but I don't have an extra PC for that. 
Can you send me a video or a tutorial maybe that can help me with some of these more detailed concepts? Thanks :)
@_date: 2015-03-04 09:24:08
Can you explain the key card?
@_date: 2015-03-05 09:07:13
@_date: 2015-03-01 10:59:21
Mind going into what armory is and offline signing? 
Thanks G1lius!
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:15:10
The something else is what i'm struggling with...
I genuinely have not found a good solution yet to making a secure wallet.
I really wish there was like 1 guide that said, Here is how you can store bitcoin securely, without needing another pc...
@_date: 2015-03-01 10:52:37
What's the best Wallet in your mind? I find that has been the HARDEST thing for me to do, is to securely store a wallet, without losing a computer and my wallet as well.
@_date: 2015-03-04 09:19:48
Google price fixing. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:51:25
I actually really like that, I think I might try bitgo. 
But how do you safely guard your wallet? 
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:20:55
So for a real powerful wallet, it's Trezor, ledger, or paper wallet generated offline, or bust right?
Can you give me more information about Paper Wallet ?
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:16:11
How do you store your wallet in so many places? 
Is it because you have a multi signature wallet? I thought you only had 1 master key that you had to protect? Or is Trezor doing that ?
@_date: 2015-03-02 03:57:59
lol I don't know what you mean sorry :)
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:24:07
But who would hold my wallet? Mycelium? Wouldn't I then be giving up control of my wallet to them? 
@_date: 2015-03-04 09:30:01
Thank you!
@_date: 2015-03-05 06:02:40
I really don't want to enter a cornered market. I and yourself would love money as it rode up and down. We could never predict it correctly enough. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 04:03:24
You didn't read points 2 and 3. If you buy slow, and in large chunks, over the course of 3 years, you could avoid price shocks.
Manipulation doesn't need to come from a regulation. It can happen naturally through the market. Try reading the Cornering the market wiki or some of the JP morgan examples of how they cornered the market. I feel like your knowledge in that craft is a bit lacking. 
@_date: 2015-03-03 02:53:01
I want a trezor man! 1st world problems :P :D
@_date: 2015-03-01 11:28:08
Couldn't I just buy 40% of the market, and then force the price up artificially and then dump it all? 
What stops someone from cornering the bitocoin market? I'm trying to find some tangible deterrent. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 12:15:00
Thank you! :)
@_date: 2015-03-01 12:13:23
How do you outlaw it? lol
@_date: 2015-03-01 11:40:24
I feel like you need to be a bit more creative.
Assume these facts:
1. I'm worth 100 million dollars. I can easily absorb the bitcoins. 
2. I will buy bitcoins at 5% greater than going market rate, and constantly keep buying from new sources, aiming for big purchases to lock in good prices.
3. I will do this for the next 3-5 years until I have 10-40% of the market.
4. I will then force demand up by limiting supply (Similar to how banks sell homes for a lot of money slowly, because they only LIST a limited amount of homes for sale instead of listing all of them for sale. I would only list .01% or less of my total coins for sale, artificially shrinking the total supply of the coins). The price I list these coins for sale is very high, but because the supply is low, people end up paying since they have no choice.
5. I continue to constantly buy bitcoins when cheap from independent sellers who need money fast. 
6. I increase my share in the Bitcoin market so as to control more of it and to continue shrinking the supply.
7. Eventually I own 40% of the market, I sell very few bitcoins, and I charge obscene amounts for them. Then when I flood the market with supply periodically driving prices way down, I buy a LARGE amount of bitcoins up, more than I lost, at discounted rates. 
This is the old playbook of the Wall Street king pins. It's old, dusty, and effective.
Given the above, what would stop someone from controlling the market? 
@_date: 2015-03-01 11:21:58
Ledger seems more affordable. What is lacking about it, that makes it cheaper than Trezor?
I really like both and I'm leaning towards those. I don't want my private key stored on a random computer, and I don't have a computer to spare for cold storage.
