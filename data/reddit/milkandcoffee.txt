I assume you use a small bank or local bank. People hate on big banks like BofA, Chase, Wells Fargo but their services and convenience make it worth for me. Sorry if I am assuming you live in the USA.

when I signed up for my bank of america account in 2007 not sure if things have changed. I put my SSN and ID number online and everything was signed electronically.

I opened my account online. My paycheck goes directly to my bank account. 99% of the time I need cash I do cash back at stores. I sometimes use my bank ATM which is not located inside a bank but inside the grocery store I visit. Any trouble with my account or card I call their 1800. I never needed to got.
