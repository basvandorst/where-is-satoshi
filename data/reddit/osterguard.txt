Actually, logic is not an objective thing, ESPECIALLY when it comes to arguments of human gain and suffering.

That's... not how logic works. I'm honestly starting to wonder how someone like you could ever function in society.

THAT'S THE POINT I'M TRYING TO MAKE. If these security companies can profit from extortion if you don't pay, they will. They have the monopoly on violence. I don't see them "going out of business" because you don't like them if they're the ones with the gun to your head.

That's right, they don't have to worry about shareholders. They have to worry about their constituents, and the fact that their competition (other political parties) will seize upon any "bad business".

It depends on your definition of government I suppose. By my reasoning, a group of people banding together and making decisions about protection would constitute a government.

Sorry, that was rude of me, and I apologise. I'm just seeing a lot of bandwagon 16 year olds in this thread.
You say that everyone's currency will become more valuable, but if it's everyone, the total value won't change. Prices will compensate, and everything stays the same, but the currency becomes unstable. The largest issue with deflation is that the real value of debt increases, which shouldn't be too much problem on an individual scale, but (especially in the case of bitcoin), you have constant debts, with the remaining amount of currency dropping. That's an issue. Debt is a very common thing, so this won't be a minor issue. Eventually,you get to the point where you have more debt than remaining currency, and I'm sure you can see the issue there.

I agree with you on the violence point. On the whole, we are becoming less violent, but we're not becoming less scared. Scared people band together for support, and once that happens, you have the beginning of a government. I hope that explains what I meant :)

No, that is not how money works. That would be a TERRIBLE TERRIBLE THING for reasons that should be completely obvious. You could say the exact same thing about fiat currencies. "Well, $1000 will just become the new $1 I guess". Bitcoin isn't special just because it's virtual. Jesus Christ.

I think it's funny that you say something like a "rogue" security firm would NEVER happen (just fyi, it would) while simultaneously describing a system that you say is the same that ALREADY EXISTS. You can't say it would never happen while giving examples of past cases, that just doesn't make sense.

I bet you hate paying taxes, while simultaneously reaping the benefits of a taxed society, such as nice roads, an army to deter invasions, clean water, etc. It's simply TERRIBLE, isn't it? I mean, you didn't ask for it, did you? You're so hard done by, you poor, poor thing.
Although, to answer your question, yes, it has been incredibly profitable and beneficial. WHY ELSE WOULD THEY DO IT? You seem to be too naive to understand that power is far more useful than money, and in any case, it's not the salaries of the politicians and government workers that are suffering, so it's a net gain for them.

You're kidding right? Even if you somehow DRASTICALLY reduced Humanity's violence (which won't happen in a million years, despite your fluffy little utopian anarchist wet dreams), ALL it would take is a couple of desperate or opportunistic (not even inherently violent) people, and then people get scared. And it's pretty well known that when people get scared, they take drastic measures. Then you have a government. Maybe the government is the security force, or maybe it's a small group of armed citizens. You no longer have anarchy, and the world still sucks.
@_date: 2014-04-26 03:34:48
No problem :)
@_date: 2014-04-26 09:27:40
Sorry, you're absolutely correct. My mistake.
@_date: 2014-04-26 02:04:35
I hope that was a joke.

Except it's not about whether or not it WILL make them more money (likely it will short term, but in a decade or so will result in a loss), it's about whether they THINK it will make them money.
