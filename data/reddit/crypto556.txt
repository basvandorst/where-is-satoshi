I don't get what you mean by if computing power increases. Fees will lower if A) the demand for transactions decreases, or B) If more transactions can be processed in a shorter amount of time. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 06:37:52
Wow, depending on a corporation/third party to make fees lower, the exact opposite of what Bitcoin was created to do. Nobody pays 3 cents for a transaction anymore, the average fee is over $20.

Agreed. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 04:13:11

Yes it did. Bitcoin Cash is based on the original chain. "Splitting in two" might not be the exact term I should be said, as BTC is much larger than BCH. " broke off" into two might have been better wording.

Some of the blame should be placed on the homeowners for taking loans they clearly couldn’t afford. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 22:47:59
Buy a house that is within your means. Don't buy a house you clearly can't afford when you have a bad credit history. When you take out a subprime loan you don't even own the home. The bank does for years or even decades until you pay it off. 
Of course the banks are scummy as hell for speculating mortgage backed securities with subprime loans but the point still stands. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 22:06:37
Exactly. Huge names that had billions if not trillions of credit default swaps would be gone. Pension funds might have not gotten all of their insurance money back. The common retiree might have been completely screwed. Of course in theory there should be no company that is "too big to fail". But in practicality you can't just get rid of jobs and livelihoods for millions of people.

Reading these comments also made me realize MANY people didn’t get in at a good price. For people who are “ early buyers” this can be hard to remember sometimes. The majority of Bitcoin buyers are probably at a loss or close to it.

[here]( is an article I wrote about my reasoning behind the price increase. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:35:26
If Apple was valued at $5T dollars it's share price would be X. How would Apple get to $5T? You're saying 10% of the worlds money would go into cryptocurrency? It would be great if it did but I think that is a naive assumption. Even years from now if Bitcoin goes mainstream, the USD will still have value because 1, you can only pay your taxes with USD, 2 all court settlements are settled in USD. The only possible way it could take 10% of the worlds economy is if they made Bitcoin the reserve currency. Which won't happen, we have a debt based currency sadly and there's no going back. Also correct me if I'm wrong but I don't think anyone has ever invested $1,000 and made 1.2M in an asset that already has such a high marketcap.Those are such astronomical returns, over 1.2 thousand times what you put in. The very early Bitcoin investors made that return, but not people investing when the marketcap is $100B, there is something called the diminishing returns effect. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:15:28
Good point, I meant for the frivolous forks like BTG that have no real point and don't have even a fraction of majority consensus 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:45:42
People are just way too bullish at this point... it's kind of scaring  me how they think that Bitcoin can have an 8 trillion dollar marketcap when the majority of the population doesn't have a single clue of how it works. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:41:57

@_date: 2017-11-22 16:16:22
Good point, that it's the most common question for most people, I think it might pass the recognition stage when institutional futures get involved. The devaluation of the dollar happens at a much slower rate than what Bitcoin is growing at though. The dollar might lose 2% of its value in a year but Bitcoin grows much more than that, at least for now while it's so voitile. I think there's a lot of room to grow too, but it will take much longer than just a few months now for new investors to make big returns. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:25:54
I wouldn't say it's in the early adoption stage anymore, it's being talked about in mainstream business media. Every other email I get from Investopedia is about Bitcoin, they're talking about Bitcoin on TV all the time. A year ago 99% of people had no clue what Bitcoin was and now that number has fallen considerably. It's marketcap is in the hundreds of billions. It's fantastic tech that as of now won't work as a currency for the common person. There needs to be some serious upgrades to the currency in order for it to justify going much higher in marketcap. Could you imagine if a company had a product that didn't work and they just said a solution would come around in a few years? Nobody would want to invest in them. I have money in Bitcoin and I've made a great profit but I don't know how much longer it'll last at its current state. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:31:50
That would be great but gold and Bitcoin at least for now are two completely different investments. Gold is much safer and more proven, Bitcoin is much newer and much more volatile. People invest in either one for different reasons. I personally like Bitcoin because I make more money and I understand the technology behind it, an older investor couldn't say the same.  
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:57:31
If you're in a monetary bind then buying Bitcoin might not be the best option right now 
@_date: 2017-11-13 01:16:14
Yeah but they also have to put time and manpower into making the forked coins available and safely giving their customers the forked coins so that's a drawback.

@_date: 2017-11-24 02:31:38
It's a tough issue, I think it should be used for every day transactions, other people think it should be used as solely a store of value, others think both. This rift has made some people like prominent developer Tone Vays fine with a hypothetical $100 transaction fee. It has also made the scaling debate slow and hostile. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:18:37
People might not know what futures are but the market for them is HUGE. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:44:35

@_date: 2017-11-23 19:42:50
No because there are blocks that only take a certain number of transactions. The fees rise because people who are paying essentially bid in order to be accepted in the block. So more people means higher fees unless something changes. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:22:14

@_date: 2018-11-22 05:59:05
You have no idea how this works. 
@_date: 2018-11-13 18:26:08
No it isn’t. Are you saying that Apple/Amazon shares are worthless because they don’t pay dividends? You’re taxed on dividends if they are considered income. If you let the dividends buy more shares of the underlying stock it’s actually a pretty good form of compound interest assuming you’re investing in a safe company. You get more shares which pays more dividend income and it exponentially increases over time. This is why they’re considered safe pre-retirement stocks. Dividends are considered a bonus for you to stay invested in a stock with a lower than average return. They aren’t the only reason people invest. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 23:06:26
“ if bitcoin gets to x price, then you will make a bunch of money” is not a valid reason for people to put their money into things. Explain why you think it will get to that price.

Do you even know why some large companies don’t pay dividends? 
@_date: 2018-11-16 13:37:53
No. It’s because their shareholders don’t want them to. They would rather the profit of the company go to growing the company by building new factories, releasing new products, etc. and doing things like stock buybacks. They are called growth stocks. Growth stocks tend to have higher returns than dividend stocks. 
You clearly are ignorant of how the stock market works. 
@_date: 2018-11-12 23:20:12
Dividends are made to pay to shareholders. Wtf are you talking about? When you are a shareholder your literally own a piece of the company and in a lot of cases get voting rights. 
I guess companies can highly dilute the supply but obviously that isn’t in their best interest if they want to keep shareholders happy 
@_date: 2018-11-16 18:49:06
No. They don’t and will not pay dividends. You buy them for a higher stock price than what you bought it for by the company growing bigger.

@_date: 2018-11-13 05:00:14
Dividends aren’t purely derived from a company getting profit. Companies operate at a loss sometimes and give dividends. Voting for the board of directors isn’t actually rare. Why are you automatically a chump if you’re a shareholder of a company? You forgot to mention you also own the assets as well as the liabilities of a company. Stock market prices are an illusion? It’s a market of buyers and sellers. Every price you see is what people are willing to pay for a share of a company. I think you’re financially ignorant and assume ALL conventional investing = scam.  
If bitcoin is this holy grail of investing then why is the space filled with wash trading and pump and dump schemes? Not to mention that there are giant players that own an insane amount of the supply of some of these coins and can significantly manipulate the price. Just look at the flash crash of Ethereum that happened a little while back. That would NEVER happen in the stock market.

Why do people compare gold and BTC as if they’re equal. It would take $800,000 as supposed to 8,400 to own that percentage of the supply due to gold actually being a proven store of value. These stupid arguments are why people bought BTC at insanely high prices without doing any research. They had intelligent people spouting autistic baseless arguments to them that sound good.

I’m not saying it does. I’m just saying that real world resources have been put into Bitcoin and it’s value is not 100% arbitrary like many nocoiners claim it to be. Of course I’m not saying bitcoin is “ backed” by miners either. I think it’s value comes from several different factors. And yes, I completely agree with the system making the block chain much more secure. I definitely could have expanded on the latter point.

Blocks, which are big groups of transactions are full. So when you pay a transaction fee you're essentially competing to be confirmed the soonest. This has driven prices up. Bitcoin Cash has bigger blocks so they're able to process more payments, plus it's just less popular so it's less full. If the miners drop the fees they get less money so they wouldn't want to drop them.

Are there any wallets or exchanges with customizable fees?

21 million bitcoin times $1M would be three times higher than the global market cap for gold. I doubt It. People will downvote this. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:24:01
Because Bitcoin is more expensive now and we still use USD as a comparison because that is what we are paid with from our jobs and what the majority of people pay attention to. 
@_date: 2017-10-08 00:52:06
So there will be normal Bitcoin with Segwit, Segwit2x with segwit and bigger blocks, and then Bitcoin cash with just bigger blocks?

Yeah but people would just convert it to usd anyways in their heads even if the fees were presented in BTC

@_date: 2017-05-25 02:35:06
I am just buying and holding because I think it'll go up in the long run. I wouldn't suggest buying now to make a quick buck though. Then again there's no telling what will happen in the near future. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 13:12:57
Well I see it being a good tool for banks to send payments easier. But I just don't see how that justifies its price exploding so fast 
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:44:28
Well Bitcoin has been in the spotlight because Japan has been buying it by storm recently. It's also a mix of hype and people not wanting to miss out on profits. And because of all that all the mainstream stock programs have been talking about Bitcoin again. As for Ethereum lm not as knowledgeable so I can't give you a straight answer 
@_date: 2017-05-19 14:38:36
That wouldn't suprise me at all 
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:37:06
I think there will be a correction but not nearly as big or as long of a trough as 2013. In 2013 there were less institutions and less people backing or trusting Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-05-18 13:20:44
I definitely think a compromise is the best thing for bitcoin long term. It might not be everyone's favorite outcome but it's better than a deadlock of no progress. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:20:05
This isn't hype at all. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:35:01
Essentially it's a modification to the algorithm to make more transactions happen at one time. So that will make transactions happen quicker and fees will lower as a result. It's one solution to the problem of what they call Bitcoin scalability, or how Bitcoin can adapt to fit the needs of the now millions of people who use it. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:37:16
Bitcoin since it is the largest and most reputable. If you have any left over cash then invest in Altcoins.   
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:39:02
A hardware wallet is the best choice. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:03:25
Hardware wallets are definitely the safest outlet for your Bitcoins since like you said, you own an IOU for the coins once you withdrawal, not the coins themselves. But since you're not using very much money and you're just a beginner, keeping it on an exchange isn't a bad decision. As you put in more money then a hardware wallet should become more of a priority. And also saying what wallet you use and how much BTC you have isn't a bad thing. Just don't share the wallet address. Also it isn't very viable to put in super small amounts of money, like $5 or less because of transaction fees. But if you put in a moderate 10-20 the fee won't be as much of an issue. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:43:56
I'm going to get a lot of hate for this but if you're a beginner, putting a little bit of money into Coinbase won't be a bad start since it is convenient . Then as you get more experience you might want to consider a better exchange. If you put $500 in I'd suggest getting a hardware wallet to keep your coins safe because when you buy Bitcoin on an exchange you own an IOU for when you withdrawal, not the actual coins themselves. But make sure you understand the technology, only invest money you can afford to lose, and have a plan for when you buy and sell. Don't put in money in fear of missing out either, that's sheep mentality and will make you lose money. I hope this helps  
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:21:37
Do research, assess your risk tolerance. Have a plan for buying ans selling. Don't buy solely because of hype. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:45:25
Don't be toxic, the more people who get involved in Bitcoin the more money we'll make in the long run. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:39:47
The market will correct itself, it's just a bunch of people selling their altcoins since the BTC price has gone up so much. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 01:14:47
Poloniex for altcoins 
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:09:38
Even if the price falls to 1400/1500 just hold and it will go higher in the future. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 13:06:02
I think so. People will move their positions from smaller Altcoins to Bitcoin as well as to larger Altcoins like Ethereum and Litecoin who both have more practical purposes and something to add to the crypto space. 
@_date: 2017-05-23 00:18:10
Do research. figure out your risk tolerance. have a plan for buying and selling. Dont buy just because you dont want to "miss out" on profits. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:44:09
I doubt Bitcoin is going to become the worlds money supply, the average consumer is too ignorant and debt ridden to understand the future of technology. If anything it will be similar to gold where people flock to it in times of crisis and see it as a safe investment. Overall I think it will rise in price to astronomical levels over time as more countries adopt it and it becomes easier for the average investor to obtain them 
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:41:33
Ethereum, Dash and Litecoin are all ones that seem promising. But once the Bitcoin scaleability issue gets solved I think Altcoins are going to drop in price.  
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:24:55
I'm just trying to address forms of criticism from each side, I don't personally think that there are eminent security flaws in Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:20:15
Oh ok, thanks for the info! And I'm confused as to when we'll find out about the whole situation, will it be at 12 am august 1st? Or will it activate at some random point throughout the day 
@_date: 2017-05-09 15:28:35
No, the price has been going up for the last year. This has been due in part to many different countries starting to adopt Bitcoin. Not to too much hype or super bullish media coverage. 
@_date: 2017-05-24 02:49:57
Bitcoin taxes have to do with Bitcoin if you ask me. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 14:00:56
I would buy more if anything, unless there was some huge never before seen technical flaw to why it fell so much. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 17:49:19
There's many different questions you need to ask yourself. If Bitcoin crashes to $2 tommorow can I afford to lose my money? Do you think Bitcoin will rise in value in the future? How long do I want to hold it for? What do I know about blockchain technology? All these questions and more are individualized and there is no formula for when a person should buy any financial asset. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 13:42:06
Correction. It corrected to pre day prices at 2400-2500
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:23:09
Well it all depends on what your plans for buying/selling are. Theres no formula to determine when Bitcoin will go up or down. In my opinion crypto is much less technical and more emotional than traditional financial markets. 
@_date: 2017-05-20 14:02:22
Make sure to get a hardware wallet. Don't leave it all on an exchange. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:37:08
Oh ok. Yeah I must be confusing the two, do you know if Gemni has a statement on the split? And thanks for the clarification, all this info is getting jumbled in my head. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:32:15
Right now I keep all my coins on an exchange since I have so little money invested at the moment. So I'm not of expertise to distinguish between wallets I've never used. I've heard good things about all three though. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 19:44:55

Why are people so toxic, that's something my 10 year old brother would do 
@_date: 2017-05-20 14:07:28
There's a lot of very helpful reviews on YouTube. The most reputable brands are keepkey and trezor. But a hardware wallet is a physical device that stores your bitcoin so nobody can steal it. When you put your money on an exchange you don't actually own the Bitcoin you buy, you own an IOU for the exchange to give you the Bitcoin once you withdrawal it. So if a hacker steals Bitcoin from an exchange you're pretty much screwed. So it's good if you have a lot of money that you don't want to lose to buy on an exchange and transfer it to a hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 18:36:35
Japan is one of the many reasons, since they recently started to adopt it. Also I've been seeing Bitcoin news pop up on a lot of my stock apps so it's also just a bunch of hype from people who don't want to miss out.

I think its 75% legitimate growth with many new people and institutions getting involved. Because of this though some people are buying into the hype.

That exponential of a raise sounds kind of impossible.  
@_date: 2017-05-04 17:56:05
You can use your own checking account on Coinbase, that's what I did when I was 17. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 15:43:27
If you can afford to lose your savings, have a plan for buying and selling and are well educated than go ahead. 
@_date: 2017-05-22 17:36:34
It all depends on how much money you have in coinbase. If it's a small enough amount to where you wouldn't be devastated if it suddenly went away then you can just keep it there.But always remember that you don't actually own the coins on an exchange until you withdrawal them. You actually own an IOU from the exchange. There are plenty of tutorials on YouTube that teach you how to move funds to any hardware wallet. It's not that difficult. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 19:42:39
That's awesome

A block is essentially a run-through of the Bitcoin algorithm that processes payments. In order for a block to be verified as valid by miners all previous blocks must be verified, so since the blocks link together sort of like a chain they call it the blockchain. 
@_date: 2017-06-12 19:29:24
The word hodl comes from a typo of the word hold. People just say to hodl rather than hold your bitcoin as a joke. So when they said to hodl the blockchain they pretty much just said hold your bitcoin and don't switch to other coins, which have other block chains.
