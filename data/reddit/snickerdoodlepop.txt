I honestly believe that the central bank's are too powerful to let what is mentioned in the article to occur. it's pretty hard to replace fiat as a base currency. I guess that is why the banning of use as well.
could be wrong, time will let me know
Edit: In the mean time...HODL!

Then its very possible that they may ask for some more verification.. you do have (notice i am using present tense as the money is still yours) a lot of asset.. what's a good sign is they are still saying it is under review.. so that means its not left forgotten.. do you-in this vast chain of upvotes- know anybody else who has this issue?

relax. breathe.. its just under review.. it will be fine.. i know it's a big amount but have they told you what is the reason for this action?

Verification is still fine buddy.. but it's worse when your in the system and can't get out..

Rather.. they ask you to pay for the presents and have the presents and your money

Started with curiosity, then anger, then frustration, then denial.. now humour to get some attention :)
Let's put a smile on that face!
