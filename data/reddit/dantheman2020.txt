The volatility of bitcoin may drop as it becomes more widely adopted, the value is more clearly understood, and the total value stored in bitcoin becomes much larger. If this does not cause a sufficient drop in volatility, then it may be necessary to use decentralized derivatives to offset price fluctuations, or to use a stablecoin like Dai (but built on and collateralized by bitcoin).
Volatility does make usage challenging. However, people do use volatile local currencies (or a combination of volatile local currencies) in certain areas of the world. It makes commerce more challenging, but not impossible.

The zimbabwe 100 trillion dollar bill is worth more now (when it is not backed by the govt) than when it was the official currency. Govt backing isn't worth much. People don't want govt backing. They want to store value. Governments do not have the power to protect from loss. Otherwise the many cases of devaluation and hyperinflation and currency collapse would not have happened.

You can choose what you want to do with your bitcoin. If someone else chooses to hold, they support the bitcoin economy that way. If they choose to spend, they support it another way. Any holder raises the price by restricting available supply. When the price rises, it incentivizes others to spend.

People talking about bitcoin, including holdings, encourages adoption. If 1 bitcoin is worth a huge amount of money in the future, holders of 1 bitcoin can afford security systems, etc. Besides, most people who had a lot of BTC at one point no longer do (spent, sold, lost, etc). Finally, in a future where bitcoin is more valuable, more people will have bitcoin and most bitcoin will be stored in a way that is not vulnerable to armed robbery (multisig, timelocks, geographically distrbuted keys, passphrases, secure hardware, etc)

Given that computing power is  cheap, it would be nice to have a piece of code that checks as many derivation paths for a given key as possible. There have been cases where HD wallets left some derived paths empty and on restore, subsequently used paths were not found (as the restore assumed that empty addresses in the sequence meant the end).

Right, but each percentage point of total network hashing power is increasingly difficult to get. If the "good" miners have 100 Exahashes, you will need to get 100+ for 51%, 200+ for 66% and 900+ for 90%.
Meaningful fees do help against a censorship 51% attack, or against total censorship 51% attack (that is, empty blocks - does this attack already have a name?).

A long passphrase would be a better idea than a custom derivation path. It would buy you more time. Also, if you kept a tiny amount of funds on the no passphrase paths, you could get some warning if the key was compromised (an email is sent to you if funds are moved from the canary address, for example)

125x seems very high given the historical volatility of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. If many people use this high degree of leverage, they are going to be targets for whales trying to liquidate them.
@_date: 2019-10-22 13:43:03
And how much did you lose relative to BTC by holding something that is losing value and has no future? I agree, your knockoff is great for getting rid of. BTC has almost all the hashrate on SHA256. Anything else on SHA256 has essentially zero security. It's only alive because no one bothers to attack it.

Firstly, bitcoin isn't deflationary for many years. Also, many sectors of the economy have become cheaper over time. Televisions drop significantly in price each year (while increasing in quality). And yet, people keep buying televisions. The economic theories predict that television sales would collapse because people could just keep delaying their purchase while their purchasing power rises. But that isn't how things actually work.

Events that are known in advance should be priced in according to the Efficient Market Hypothesis. However, the last two halvings in bitcoin were not priced in. It does not seem that bitcoin has become an efficient market yet.

I am not in Canada, so I can't make a specific suggestion.
Proof of reserves is not enough, but it is better than not doing it.
I would look for an exchange that has a serious track record, or was founded by employees with strong positive track records, as well as an attitude of doing things carefully and correctly and transparently.
Or alternately, something noncustodial so funds cannot be stolen.

Yes, you can have escrow with bitcoin. This could be a traditional escrow (a third party has custody during transactions) or it can be with a moderator third party having partial keys, or with no moderator and both parties place bitcoins into a 2 of 2 multisig. You can add a reversible layer on top of an irreversible layer, but not the other way around. Bitcoin is the ideal base layer.

There's quite a bit of variance. An attacker with 51% hashing power would be taking a big risk to not build on the blocks of the 49%. Also, an attacker with 51% would never know exactly how much hashing power the rest of the network has, so they cannot be sure they have a majority of hashing power, especially as more time passes.

It's OK to spend it and it's OK to hodl it. Spending it increases the size of the bitcoin economy, and hodling it increases the price (which leads to more spending). We all know that 10,000 bitcoins were paid for 2 pizzas, but this was a necessary step towards bitcoin becoming a useful tool. If you do spend it, make sure you replace the bitcoins you spent (so you won't have any regrets if the price increases) and try to find places that accept bitcoin directly if possible.

There are relatively few coins on exchanges at relatively low prices - this means that selling a few coins or buying with a few dollars has an outsize effect on the market. Further, few people have a deep understanding of the fundamental value of bitcoin. Far more people are trading based on fear and greed. And finally, exchanges offer significant amounts of leverage, which amplifies price movements in both directions.
