Millennials didn't invent bitcoin, they don't even have a majority market share of bitcoin. This entire idea is ludicrous. Satoshi isn't a millenial, Hal Finney, the second guy to ever have a bitcoin, was 58 when he died in 2014, everyone involved early on were not millenials (all old-school crypto guys). I love how millenials even feel 'entitled' to bitcoin's credit.

I myself find that kind of black and white thinking particularly naive. The world isn't black and white. And you shouldn't fall into an "Us vs. Them" mentality. That's intellectually lazy. The U.S isn't all sunshine and rainbows but that doesn't mean the 'other side' is either. Every country and culture has their positives &amp; negatives. Don't promote one at the expense or while ignoring the other.

People throw this around as if it means something here, in a financial market where there are millions (even billions) of dollars on the board, up for the taking. 
Someone is spamming the mempool with trash transactions; transactions which do not go through or get rejected/ignored, or even just to fill up the pool and jack up fees. We're talking .00000001 btc sends with no or an equally low miners fee. Tens of thousands of them. One? Ok, yeah. maybe that's an accident/stupidity. But [tens of thousands]( of instances/examples over a 2 year span? That's purposeful, that's an attack with intent. That's no accident.
As for the who; that should be relatively obvious. Those who benefit are those with the most to gain. Notably, the people invested in alternatives. Or it could even be companies like Bitmain and their mining pools doing it in order to get people to switch to their competing currency that they will have more control over (a currency where bitcoin core isn't acting as a check/balance). A currency where there is no segwit, no lightning network or atomic swaps, and full blown covert asic boost. To them, spending tens or hundreds of thousands of dollar, even millions in order to make the coin you control the new default/leader cryptocurrency would give you immense power in the decade to come. For an entity like that, it may not even be about money, but power &amp; control as they're looking long term. 
You talk of Hanlon's razor but I think Occam's razor applies. What's the simpler explanation? Someone has been filling the mempool up with spam transactions *accidentally* for a couple years now? Somehow not running out of funding or not noticing? Or that some entity is doing it maliciously in order to further their own goals/agenda?

Except; The biggest investors/holders of bitcoin are not Millennials. Haha. A massive percentage of the bitcoin that exists today, is not in the hands of your generation. Hell, bitcoin wasn't created by a millenial either, Satoshi posted on forums where old cryptography guys hung out. He hung out in the old circles. 
Hal Finney, the guy who Satoshi first sent bitcoin to, before anyone else, was 58 at the time of his passing in 2014. Nick Szabo? Graduated in 1989. Bitcoin was **not** pioneered by millennials, though it's cute how they feel entitled to the credit. They truly are the entitled generation. I'm actually having a hard time thinking of something they've given the world that revolutionized it, or changed it. Everything recent that I think of, from websites to technology, was invented by Gen-xers or even Boomers.

And going back to the gold standard? Are you mentally challenged? Anyone who has taken an entry level economics course should know why that's an insane idea - it would literally destroy our economy. The obvious reasons it would do so aside, the reason these morons want the gold standard is because the dollar would become more valuable in relation to other currencies. But that's the problem; it would be too expensive for any country to do business with us. Our export industry would literally cease to exist. 
And even the reasons naive kids jumped on the Ron Paul train back in 2008 are a sham; Marijuana legalization. Ron Paul was never pro-weed, he was pro-letting states decide if they want it legal. He himself said he didn't want it legal in Texas (where he's from). 
And that's not even the tip of the iceberg, the guy took a bunch of donations from young fools and then handed that cash to his family.

Most drug killings aren't debt related. That's nonsense. They're turf related, theft related (let's kill this fucker and steal his 2 bricks of cocaine), or revenge related. 
Killing people over drug debt is shit they do in the movies, but doesn't happen in real life (not as commonly as you imply, anyways), it's hollywood bullshit. People want their money back, they don't want to kill someone and then in addition to a murder charge, they have none of their money back. That doesn't make any sense. People would much rather have their money back because people are greedy, and because most people aren't murderers or killers. They'll beat the shit out of people, break arms and legs, but murder? How will you get your money back then?

A rational reason? Not OP but if bitcoin's "true" value is anywhere above 15k, there will be some small dips, but not a correction until it rises past its "true" value. The problem is, we don't know its true value yet. It's still in its adoption phase. That's why there shouldn't be a correction; its not a stable commodity yet, it's still growing &amp; maturing. Corrections come after the commodity has matured and developed, hence "corrected".

I hate this comparison because there is **zero** evidence that the U.S government control bitcoin, and same for the illuminati. It's not even remotely possible.
However, while China has become a bit more capitalistic these past 20-30 years, *they're still one of the most authoritarian governments on the planet*. They are only beholden to themselves. They could march into Bitmain, seize control of all mining within the country and nobody could do a damn thing. Hell, they could do it 10 minutes from now and keep it secret if they so wished. "You tell anyone, all of your families end up in re-education camps". 
The scary part is they **don't need too**. They could just ask Jihan politely to do what they ask, and Jihan would comply. He would comply because if he doesn't, at best he looses his business. At worst, his family, friends, friends of friends, etc. will suffer or worse. It's like being a Russian citizen and getting a call from Putin asking you to do something. You gonna say no? Who the hell would say no to him in Russia? They'd just vanish and get replaced with someone who would. China is no different. They just disappeared a small bookstore owner in Hong Kong for a few weeks because he wouldn't turn over customer list. Apparently Hong Kong hasn't learned they lost their freedom when China took the reigns.
There **is** a cabal running mining in China, and a monopoly on asic chips (only a single company making them, and in a huge conflict of interest, they also mine with them and delay releasing to the general public so they can profit off the lower difficulty). That much is absolute fact, it's a 3 second google search away. The question then becomes, who is controlling the cabal/cartel? I'm not saying the PRC is, but it's *significantly* more likely to be the government, or rich businessmen/politicians (often the same thing ) than the U.S government or the freaking illuminati. 
That comparison makes me angry because one is possible and I doubt many people would be shocked to hear it was the case, while the other is a nut-job conspiracy theory. It tries to equate the two as the same when they're not.
Ninja Edit: And just a side note, Core doesn't oppose big blocks. They do, however, oppose allowing covert ASICboost to continue which was in Jihan's bag.

It should be noted that the company that makes Antminer (or the asic chip inside) is Bitmain. They delay the release of their miners to the general public because they too, mine with them in a pretty big conflict of interest. They have several mining pools and are widely considered the "main" mining company as they control a huge amount of the hashrate (likely more than 50%). It benefits them to delay releasing so they can profit off the difficulty rate, which will increase once they mass release their product. So I'd guess they mine with them until their newer product comes out, keep it a secret, then starts mining with those while they release their previous model as "new". 
When you're a legitimate monopoly, you can do a whole host of shady things without anyone's knowledge, and if you're in China, without any sort of legal repercussions. 
Sounds all doom and gloom, no? Pretty shady. But there's hope. Several companies have announced that they're working on their own mining chips/rigs, including a Japanese company which claims they're working on a 7nm ASIC chip. That's going to obliterate bitmain's monopoly and it's only a matter of time before Bitmain is no longer a monopoly. 
On a side note: It's very odd that competitors within the knock-off capital of the world haven't sprung up. Where are all the knock-off asic chips at? There should be a half-dozen companies within China selling them. That's how it *always* works within China. This leads me to believe that Bitmain is a state-sanctioned monopoly. As in, the government of China is making sure Bitmain is "the one". Likely because they control it, or pull Jihan's strings. People forget, while China has become more capitalistic these last 2-3 decades, it's still run by the communist party of China, and is one of the most authoritarian governments on the planet. Bitcoin allows Chinese citizens to bypass its strict fiscal controls (some of the strictest on the planet). You can bet your ass they're keeping a close eye on everything bitcoin/crypto.

Sure they can. Why does how much they invested matter? 
There's only a single company producing ASIC chips right now, they have a monopoly. Unfortunately for the miners and Bitmain, that cannot and will not last. Other companies are allegedly working on their own bitcoin/cryptocurrency mining chips. For example, if NVIDIA or AMD rolls out something (ASIC or even something new), then all that equipment be worth significantly less, possibly nothing. There's a very real possibility that something will come out which makes those systems obsolete. That's the risk they took when they opened their pocketbook and bought all that equipment.
And don't view the miners as individuals with their own rigs chugging away, the majority of the hashpower is squarely behind China's great firewall, almost wholly owned by Bitmain and their little cabal. So not only do we have a single company producing bitcoin mining chips, in a huge conflict of interest, they mine with them too. They even try to obfuscate how much actual hashpower they control. They're an insidious group of people and **should** be replaced.

"Miners" is a misnomer. Most of the mining is dominated by a single entity under the guise of separate pools. But it's no secret that Bitmain controls the majority. They're not in it for the short term profits, they want long term control and consolidation. They want bitcoin centralized.

"The people" you speak of is the government of China. Let's not forget that fact. 
I speculate that China shut down the exchanges because they want a crypto they can control and monitor, so their citizens cannot violate their own fiscal controls (citizens of China cannot move money out of the country without government approval, which they rarely give unless you're mega-rich already, for example). They track **everything** their citizens do with their money.

**Don't apply western logic to Chinese governments**.
China has insanely strict fiscal controls on its citizens. Controls and restrictions/regulations that make U.S financial regulations look like a libertarian utopia by comparison. Chinese citizens cannot invest in foreign companies or move money out of the country (without government approval, which they never give). Cryptocurrencies allow them to do just that. And in China, control is everything. They track and control just about every facet of their citizens lives. They didn't put up a great firewall just for the lulz. 
With that in mind, why *wouldn't* they ban cryptocurrency? You'd have to be a naive fool or wholly ignorant of Chinese domestic policies to think they'd allow cryptos to continue unregulated. They're not going to upend 40 years of central planning just because some new technology cropped up. Cryptocurrencies will be regulated the same as anything else, and they're already moving to ban VPNs in the country. 
China has never been a friend to cryptocurrencies. The entire concept is in direct opposition to their own domestic ideology of control, restrictions and regulations. A quick google search of their domestic economic policy should give you insight into how they're going to handle bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.

You're right; China is banning all of cryptocurrency, not just bitcoin. And they don't need to "officially declare it", that's not how China works or runs. If you don't understand that, you don't understand the PRC. They're the kind of government that will walk into all the exchanges with their military, put a gun to everyone's head and say, "Allow one more trade and we'll send your family to re-education camps". Then when trading stops, they'll say "What? We didn't ban crypto... Stop saying that". I'm exaggerating of course, but not by much.
China doesn't need to publicly announce it because that's not how they work. *Why* do they need to announce it? They literally don't give a shit because who is going to say anything? You think crypto fans in China are going to go protest? Again, that's not how China works. They'll make all those protesters disappear in under an hour if they were inclined. 
The People's Republic of China literally owns and runs the media in China. It's all state-ran. There are no independent news agencies, or at the very least, none without strict government oversight. So China puts out the news it wants. It doesn't need to put out a news report stating its banning bitcoin because it doesn't have too. That's the difference.

I don't know if bitcoin will become that big, but cryptocurrencies in general, as a whole, are becoming a massive market. Multibillion dollar market cap. That's not an insignificant amount and it's still in its "niche" stage of life. There will be a common cryptocurrency that expands beyond niche use but the question becomes, which one will it be? Bitcoin? Litecoin? Monero? Ethereum? Some crypto that hasn't been invented yet? This is why there's billions of dollars in the world of cryptocurrency; everyone is speculating on which one will "win". 
I do agree with you; I don't think it will be bitcoin. Too much hashrate rests within China (more than 60%. For an allegedly decentralized currency, and only a single company makes and sells the mining equipment [it too is in China], decentralization is failing. Oh, and guess what, that company that makes &amp; sells the ASIC chips to mine with also mines bitcoin and mine *a lot*. It's doomed to fail.) Bitcoin is going through some serious drama right now whereby the miners are seeing their future profits threatened so are fighting the core developers and users/investors. 
Litecoin is a viable competitor who has fixed some of those problems already, but still suffers from the fact that much of the hashrate and mining equipment is centralized in China. If Litecoin ever replaced bitcoin, it would suffer the same exact issues with the "China monopoly".
Ethereum is a viable contender, since it can code in penalties for holding a majority of the hashrate. There are safegaurds in place to keep everything decentralized but it suffers from bubble-itis. ICOs are going to damage the currency.
I'm waiting for an asic resistant crypto that has the capabilities of Ethereum, the anonymity of Monero, the passionate &amp; intelligent developers of LTC and the usage/value of BTC. It doesn't exist yet but when it does, better get in early.

Just like cash payments are not anonymous but they *can* be anonymous if you take the proper steps and make the effort. But you cannot use cash online anonymously (or rather, you cannot do so ubiquitously). 


Well, aside from being regulated by whatever country they're in, *the law* is a pretty big incentive to figure out who is defrauding who so they don't jeopardize their company and further business. A suit brought against them in the court of law, even a frivolous suit still cost them money. So there's also a fiscal incentive. And repeated actions can turn into a class action lawsuit which could cost them anywhere from millions to billions depending on the offense.

Aside from your fantastical and unlikely beliefs, I'd still rather have that then the *actual reality* of China controlling bitcoin via proxy (Jihan and his cronies). Wall Street &gt;&gt; China

Regardless, the point stands. I'm a huge fan of Bitcoin. I have quite a bit of assets tied up in it and was lucky enough to get in early. But I have enjoyed watching the libertarians and anarcho capitalists slowly (and painfully) learn why financial regulations exist. Most regulations were made to stop some awful thing from happening, a thing which almost certainly was commonplace and/or disastrous before the regulation. So laws were put into place to either protect people and their money, or to keep businesses from becoming monopolies (by way of anti-trust laws).
Sure, some laws seem overbearing and excessive - but that's because you weren't on the opposite end of that law. In the end, society overwhelmingly chose to have rules &amp; regulations over the wild west where anything goes. People *will* choose protection when it comes to losing their entire savings &amp; investments. Only the young, naive and stupid prefer to take the risk of losing everything.
Again, don't get me wrong. I love BTC. But I'm not a moron who believes regulations and rules were put in place to "keep me down".

This logic is moronic. You're competing with an entire nation. The nation of China. Oh, wait, were you under the impression that businesses in China operate the same way as businesses in the West? I sincerely hope you don't hold or have any naive or ignorant beliefs like that. 
China can subsidize the shit out of anything, hell, they can do it simply out of spite (and they often do, just ask Japan about the rare earth's fiasco a few years back). They take no losses or risk because to them, it's literally nothing.
Even if the Chinese government didn't have their fingers in this mess (they most certainly do), China is still an insanely [corrupt country]( A few bribes here, a few bribes there, and your business is undercutting everyone by *orders of magnitude*. 
TL;DR **It's not a level playing field as you imply, believing otherwise is incredibly naive**.

Backed by the Chinese government no doubt. Where did that millions come from, I wonder?


If his investment money came from the Chinese government, it's in his interest to do whatever the fuck they tell him to do. China doesn't give a shit about a few measly dollars, and to a nation the size of China, millions of dollars is quite literally not worth picking up if they saw it lying on the sidewalk, to them it would be like ignoring a penny on the ground. And a few million dollars to poison that well is a steal for them. It's a no-brainer.
Let me ask you one question; what do you think is in China's best interests when it comes to bitcoin? That's right, for it to fail and fail spectacularly. China loathes what it cannot control. And it will attempt to control even the uncontrollable (see: Great Firewall). A decentralized currency runs completely opposite to China's own currency and ideology.
You're trying to apply logic to a system or dynamic you have ass-backwards. Business in China do not operate like they do in the west -- in China, the government has a say in everything. The state literally has its finger in every pie, and can tell business what to do. Even in businesses not run in China, so long as there's a Chinese national at the top, they can get them to do what they want by threatening family and friends who are still back home. Though they typically usually like to offer financial/fiscal rewards first (carrot before the stick, as it were) since the results tend to be much more favorable and certain.

On the opposite side of the spectrum; atomic swaps and LN should tie LTC directly to bitcoin, price and all. You'll be able to use LTC interchangeably with BTC. Since there are 4x amount of LTC coins, theoretically the price of LTC will be 1/4th of bitcoins.

Most physicists who dabble in such things don't believe in paradoxes. They believe in the many worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics. This deals with wave form collapses. Basically, the moment you travel back in time, a new reality or world-line is created allowing you to do whatever you want without affecting the reality you just came from. Thus, no paradoxes. Essentially, for every possible outcome, there exists a reality in which that outcome has occurred. So you could go back in time, kill your grandfather before you were born, and still exist without violating any sort of rule or law (or creating a paradox) because the reality in which your grandfather dies by your hand is not the reality in which you come from.

I remember back in the late 90s, they said high quality videos would never be on the internet due to insane bandwidth costs and the time it would take to download on your dial-up modem. Most recently, streaming 4k would never be a thing either, bandwidth costs. 
You talk about growth but you fail to see the growth/price drop of bandwidth?

To be licensed in the U.S for money services (MSB), you have to adhere to certain regulations and provide certain services. If you do not, you can and will lose your permit and also likely be sued to fuck. Coinbase, for example, is licensed in all but 3-4 states. I think it's similar with Poloniex. They're obligated to provide a certain level of service and if they aren't providing that service, they should have their licenses revoked. End of story.

All these shills from just saying "no", I don't get them. Due to the panic of another entity almost acquiring 51% of the hashrate back in 2014, there is no way a company like Bitmain would do it in the open. So it **wouldn't** be obvious... It would all be covert, and given the evidence at hand, it's almost certainly true that they own 51% or more of the hashrate.
One thing, however, is undisputed fact: more than 80% of the hashrate rests within China. That is not good for anyone. It terrifies me because China is the least trustworthy when it comes to fiscal ideology &amp; policy. Do people not forget they have a great firewall to keep their own citizens uninformed? 
@_date: 2017-06-27 05:46:36


That's what China's been doing for decades now. 


Huh? China's been imposing strict capital controls for decades now. Granted, it's not sustainable in that if they take their hands off the wheel, the whole thing comes crashing down, but by definition, strict capital controls requires hands being on the wheel. So I argue that capital controls *are* sustainable, otherwise China's economy wouldn't exist.
Ninja Edit: Just to add on, India *has* imposed capital controls -- they got rid of their "black money" recently.

Why is it happening though? I think that's the most important thing to ask. Because it gives insight if it will rise higher, or if we're peaking. 
I know it reached 2800 last week and everyone said it would drop again, which it did, but why is it rising again? 
@_date: 2017-06-20 13:54:20
Kill? You're right, they can't. However, bring it to its knees? Damage the fuck out of it? Cause panic and disorder? Hurt people investing in it? Cause the price to drop *dramatically*? They can do all of those things because much of the power (market cap, hashrate, mining pools, etc etc etc) all rests within China's loving "free" embrace. 
Given China's own incredibly strict fiscal controls on its monetary supply and citizens money, I'm sure they're going to continue to look the other way indefinitely. They'll have no trouble allowing a decentralized, anonymous currency to operate within its borders without oversight or control. /s

Remind me, which country hosts most of that hashrate? All that hashrate resting within the borders of a single country, and in particular, *that* country cannot be good for the health of bitcoin. Remind me again, wasn't there something about "decentralization" in its ideology? Perhaps I'm misremembering. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 02:52:45


Well, you have two choices. You can trust Core devs or you can trust the miners. Should be an easy call -- miners make their decisions out of self-interest, not necessarily what's good for bitcoin. They're selfish, by and large. They're not here for charity. Core devs on the other hand, their reasons are a bit more altruistic.  At the very least, they're not considering their mining rigs or making money off high fees or covert asicboost. For the average users/investor/hodlr, the Core devs interests align better with their own. And when you consider the fact that a huge percentage of the hashrate rests within China, you're also looking at core devs being less centralized.

I'm a fan of bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general. Own quite a bit. But I never got into it for the libertarian reasons a lot of redditors did. It's enlightening and frankly, entertaining to watch libertarians and ancaps slowly learn why these kinds of regulations exist in the first place. They're all "down with the system! down with regulations, they're only holding me and my money back!" until it's their money missing or at risk. Then they're the ones crying the loudest. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 14:01:49
The U.S does. Nearly every country anyways. It has enough leverage (monetary, economic and political capital) to force most of its allies to act on its interests if it was so inclined, and many of its enemies too. However, fortunately for us, they would burn most of that capital in the process so they wouldn't do it. It would be like using a nuke to kill ant. But the point is that they *could*. And that's completely without the use, or threat of use, of force (military, war, etc). 
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:43:08


That's just it; I do think they're designing a new chip for mining, but isn't Asic patented or something by Bitmain? I can't see how a company like that could compete with Nvidia or AMD if both companies got serious, their infrastructure is too massive and they have too much of a market share. 
I think they're likely designing a new mining chip based on something completely new (or a spin-off of something they already have that has been re-purposed). I think (hope) it's something that lands like a nuclear bomb on Bitmain's front door. Remove them from the equation entirely.
@_date: 2017-06-27 03:37:55


I feel like I'm the only one seeing the future ramifications of this.
**And it's glorious.**
What I'm seeing are NVidia and AMD releasing video cards not just for mining, but to compete with the fucking Chinese monopolies and their Asic rigs. Both Nvidia and AMD have a significantly better infrastructure and way more resources on hand to invent &amp; build a better product (better card for mining). Perhaps even putting those shifty little shits out of business completely. 
One can dream...

Someone on twitter in response: "*[UASF] Miles Suter‏  3h3 hours ago What most of the world and especially the naysayers are (understandably) struggling to grasp is the power of world's 1st FINITE money supply*"
I don't understand how this matters at all. Just because you can't add a zero on the end doesn't mean you can't put a zero on the front. Bitcoins can be subdivided infinitely. So instead of an issue with inflation, you're dealing with deflation. It's not a problem for investors and savers, but it's not so good at being a spendable currency since tomorrow the price will jump, and the next day after it will jump some more, it becomes unwise to spend any of your money since it's going to be worth more the longer you hold it. It's called a deflationary spiral. And it can often be worse, sometimes significantly worse than inflation. It's why most economists prefer inflation to deflation -- lesser of two evils.

Actually, google **does exactly this**. They run experiments and surveys on how their results look and perform.

I don't disagree but is Avalon based out of China? How do we know they're not a subsidiary of Bitmain? Bitmain has already shown it will create mining pools and not disclose ownership in order to hide. Why wouldn't they eventually do the same with their mining rigs?

You're right, on a personal level. However, their entire ideology is based on the core concepts of "fuck you, I got mine". They assume and believe that our societies social programs will be taken care of automagically by charitable private organizations and magic dust from peter pan's pocket. No, of *all* the political ideologies one can subscribe too, libertarianism is the most greedy. I know it quite well since I once was a libertarian myself... I grew up.

The author appears to have very little knowledge of China's economic and political infrastructure. If you would have asked me last week how China would go about banning bitcoin, I would have said "by telling the banks to stop accepting yuan deposits". I would *not* have said, "By making a proclamation officially banning bitcoin".
By doing it this way, those who are "above the law" as it were (the rich, politicians, the government itself), can still dabble in bitcoins if they want without looking like hypocrites or breaking the law. It's the same reason why illicit drugs aren't outright banned in the US despite there being a 'war' on them. They're instead regulated with a scheduling system. This gives you a backdoor to access them when necessary (medical experiments, prescriptions, etc.)
No, if China wanted to ban bitcoin it would do exactly what it did. It's effectively the same thing.
Edit: Something sounded familiar about this and did some digging. Apparently I made a comment saying that [China allowing bitcoin was extremely unusual]( a month ago. I figured that they would change their mind.
