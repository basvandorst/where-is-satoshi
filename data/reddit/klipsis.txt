If by secondary school you mean similar to american jr college and beyond then I would agree. I was speaking more in terms of high-school and below, or I think what you would refer to as a primary school?

It's not tinfoil at all. Study history and you will see a constant pattern of people in power to limiting the access to information and knowledge. This isn't simply an coincident, it's a deliberate attempt to keep certain classes of people subjected and controlled.

Blue collar isn't restricted simply to manufacturing jobs which should and will be replaced by machines. I would classify blue collar as "rank and file"  jobs that are a few steps above unskilled labor. There will always be a need for low to medium skill workers, but the demand for unskilled labor will continue to decline exponential as technology develops, in my opinion. For example, a car mechanic is a medium skill job when compared to a nuclear engineer, but there is still a large difference between a mechanic and a retail clerk in terms of requisite experience and education. Going forward, the coming "robotic revolution" will still require some human interaction, albeit in a smaller scale.

That seems rather odd. I was a horrible drawer but I showed up to every class and tried my hardest and got an A even thought my "art" was awful

We need to pay blue collar workers a wage that's not significantly undervalued compared to white collar. I don't know if this is still a fact, but I believe in terms of hours worked vs production output hasn't seen a gain in value since the 60's. In other words, workers are working harder and producing more but being compensated less for it.

No I don't think that's the case. I think it's a combination of economic factors such as the result of an increase in globalization and a decrease in the relative value of labor, the decline of trade unions, the growth of the financial industry and the growing disparity in relative income between low middle and upper class Americans.

What type of school graded you in a non-academic activities based on performance? In my entire public school experience gym, art and music classes were all graded on a participation basis.
