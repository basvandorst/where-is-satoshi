Ok this might be my error.
I didn't know I have to do this. Where is this done?

I am quite confused about bitcoins and the controverse posts at the moment.
To boil everything down: Is it worth it investing? Am I going to beat myself up if I don't act now and take part in the market? Do any people make *serious* profit through these exchanges? Is it hard to "get into it" (finding a site you trust and see exact stock exchanges, quick &amp; easy transfer between BTC &amp; EUR/PayPal?)?

Can someone take a screenshot of it fully developed? It takes forever here!

I don't see how PayPal is any bad used as a transaction-platform to buy me goods, and it's not the slightest what my post was about.
I never said I'm worried about my money, I just want to have more of it.

I never got further then what you're describing. When I try the generated Password on the Homepage, it doesn't work.
I think you get the emergency password as sure as the generated password is succesfully tested.

yeah, it doesn't accept the OTPs...

I'm using 1.1.1... Musst be the newest.
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:17:18
what does "enrol" mean? (not foreign)
@_date: 2013-03-27 20:18:14
So now I don't know what we're talking about... What OTP do you mean? Do you mean the shared secret?

I'm having problems with the 2-Factor Auth...
Anyone else?
