Apparently California can't be bothered to read the FBI and IRS reports. I personally enjoyed the FBI's when it clearly stated how improbable regulation would be to implement.

The only restriction is that the items cannot be intended to inflict harm. Which is why guns were removed from it.

This may be a dumb question. But how is the cash out handled if it is used as currency and not sold for usd?

If I had any BTC I would definantly tip. Glad to see your work is going well!

If spam where an issue the mining difficulty would not be so high.

Yes bitcoins can be broken down. The smallest unit is a Satoshi. If i am right it is 1 BTC to 2100000 Satoshi.

The sad thing is that I only found out about bitcoins 2 days ago and I already have more faith in them than my countries currency.

Fair enough. Introduced it to a CS professor a few weeks ago and they have been tracking it since.

I don't understand the difference. If bitcoin is a glorified point system what is physical currency? Toilet paper? Or just waiting to be burned.

Using that argument shouldn't everyone be solo mining?

The mass purging of the trust account would flood the market reducing returns.

Will do Andy.

Agreed. Another Math/CS guy here.
