Let's be real, protesting a monetary system by clinging to a different one is sorta pointless. I don't wanna change currency from one form or another. if anything I'd like money to stop being a thing in general.

Also the weird derision that comes down on people who decide to cash out that I see even in this thread... Which is also something I see a lot with people who are REALLY caught up in some MLM scheme. 
AAAAAAND the whole "don't listen to this person's concerns, they're just spreading FUD."
like honestly for something that isn't MLM, it sure as hell has a lot of the same mannerisms.

I'll say what I've always said: the interesting technology of cryptocurrency has been ruined by people turning it into a speculative commodity to the point that it dis-incentivizes actually using it as a currency, and no matter how high the value is, it's actual worthwhile contribution other than demonstrating the absurdity and pointlessness of money as a whole is completely undermined by that very same high value being fetishized.

People call crypto a "MLM scheme for nerds" for a reason tbh

This is just about people who are selling off in abstract though. That and it's perfectly reasonable to voice why you decided that the technology at hand no longer appeals to you or that you no longer have faith in it.

The problem is that use-case is at odds with what it's actually designed for. Speculative investing in a currency by definition sort of undermines it's viability to be a currency. The more speculative it's use becomes, the less accepted it'll be as a currency (as seen with several high-profile storefronts no longer accepting it as payment) meaning the only way to reap the benefits would be to convert it back to Fiat.
What's more, I see a lot of people seeing theoretical numbers of how much they made, but that doesn't really mean a lot if the only way to actually get that into a usable state is converting it back to fiat. You'll run into the exact same problem people used to run into back in the bad old days where spontaneous bank runs could demolish a whole damn economy.

that extends to mining hardware FWIW

Apparently not. Seems to me that's just how it appeared at first.

But I thought since it was decentralized, the government could NEVER intervene in Bitcoin.
