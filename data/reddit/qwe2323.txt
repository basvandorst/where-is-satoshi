What's with all these people commenting about the shit you could do on Silk Road who obviously never went on there when it was up? No, you couldn't buy a person on there

you couldn't order hitmen on Silk Road, and I'm fairly certain any website back then that claimed you could was a fake/scam

No, you fucking couldn't. There were a limited number of categories of things, almost all drugs. Even The Armory (weapons sales sister site) shut down for lack of interest. You very clearly never went on the site when it existed.

bitcoin market cap is like 2.3%+ of the value of the broadest calculated US monetary base (M2). You really think it could reach more than twice the value of all US money? I mean, I wish, but...

But the other three are not unreasonable.

Solution: create a dummy twitter account, follow Dwolla, add account to your 'social networks'
If you prefer, don't ever put any personal information on said twitter account.

The separate Buy/Sell BTC tabs. I've fucked myself on accident a few times when meaning to put in a sell order and put it in as a buy. I liked the side-by-side system a lot better before the update.

bitcoins being mined are a small deflationary pressure on price, I don't think the anticipation of that pressure being halved a few months from now is driving the price up. Currently, the bitcoins mined in a day increase the supply of bitcoins by 0.074% (1.00074 times as much as the day before). In december this will be around a 0.034% increase per day. And remember bitcoins being mined drive *down* the price so really this should just mean it drives it down at a lower rate. Supply is not dropping, it is increasing at a decelerating rate

Bitcoin's transaction cost and speed at the moment is nowhere near it's worst point - in fact, BCH has had fees just as high as BTC has right now.

No, difficulty overall is not a determinant of BTC price. Regardless of difficulty the same amount of blocks are made (on average) so the supply increase is the same and expected supply increase in the future does not change.

There was a guy on the bitcointalk forums a year or two ago who used to sell ghost pepper (naga jolokia) homemade sauce and would throw in a couple dried peppers too. That stuff was really good, I wish he was still around. That was my first BTC purchase.
May need to try this stuff out though.

What is your favorite personal purchase using BTC?

except that it is also a true story... Magic Cards and bitcoin have a long history

Whats more interesting/important is market capitalization. The overall bitcoin market is worth much more than it was for that brief moment in June 2011. $335 million is huge - and at a pretty stable price at that. BTC/USD price would have to fall below $19.11 to have a smaller market capitalization as that peak moment in June 2011.
