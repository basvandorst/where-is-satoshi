That is dodging the point isn't it, segwit is suppose to be opt in its a soft fork. But if no solutions exists besides segwit its not a choice. Not to say segwit can't be a solution. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:19:34
Apparently I can't post about alt coins here so I'll make it a general discussion.
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:18:54
Why don't you give me a run down of why you think litecoin is better than bitcoin cash? Please enlighten me.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:48:06
Maybe coinbase is waiting to add bitcoin cash along with segwit at the same time? That way both can compete on equal terms. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:17:33
What part of my statement is false? Difficulty for bitcoin just adjusted upwards a few days ago and probably again in 2 weeks, up to 15% of hashpower ran off to bch. If prices keep dropping BTC will reach the barely scrapping by limit for miners check whattomine.com...
@_date: 2017-12-17 16:34:54
When was lightning network promised and when will it be available? I'm too lazy to do research.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:11:29
So the only way a 51% attack can happen is if bitcoin miners attack bitcoin cash? Is there any reason why they would? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:55:07
I agree that there is probably a lot of manipulation. I was just talking about roger cause this thread refers to him.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:57:36
But what if you add something that's a optional second layer via soft forking?
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:39:46
There is alot more.. do your own research and make up your own mind. I'm not going to spoon feed you all the information.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:34:46
Segwit is opt in, you can't force it even if your claim of "many people want it" is true. Core made it a "soft fork" to make it seem like there was consensus and its was not forced and it backfired. If they had hard forked into segwit the level of adoption at 15%, then it would be a much lower market cap altcoin. Segwit got carried by the bitcoin brand name not the other way around. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:13:35
So what defines bitcoin as bitcoin? Who gets to decide that?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:53:40
So you mean bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:04:36
So trying to skirt around the idea of bigger blocks with "adaptive blocks"? The same exact thing bitcoin cash is doing? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:54:32
I don't think anyone has a choice if fees are this high. If bitcoin had bigger blocks then yes it would be real opt in.

But you do have to move it right? Because its optional. I found my old wallet copay and tried to move my $10 worth of btc but it says the fees are $13... Anyone know how to set custom fees for copay? Also how do you determine the minimum fees so it doesn't get dropped out of meme pool?

@_date: 2017-12-16 00:26:29
What if you need to use segwit? Don't you need to move it to a segwit wallet? Does that mean technically bitcoin with 1mb is bitcoin and if you start using bitcoin with segwit its bitcoin segwit? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:23:05
Ok cool, so how exactly do you open a channel and how do we determine the fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:18:15
Well we did all get 1:1 bitcoin cash. I'm asking whether bitcoin with segwit can technically be considered the original.

@_date: 2017-12-15 22:20:27
Are there any sha256 coins that has at least 3% of bitcoin's hash power? I don't know where to look. Are there any incentives to scrap bitcoin cash?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:30:18
wow now that is a bubble lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 01:11:27
Alright well if you want to change the narrative instead of just adding bigger blocks in the first place... get ready for the backlash. 
I don't see charlie selling all of his litecoin right after bitcoin cash was added as a good sign. He's excuses don't make any sense and its more likely he know litecoin is overvalued. Why use bitcoin and litecoin when you can just use bitcoin cash? 
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:22:10
Pretty sure segwit is a soft fork and is optional. If they chose not to work on it's probably because they have a reason, not because they are stupid. Don't assume you are smarter than those running the company that have experience running a business. 
Edit: 
My personal opinion... Likely because the new userbase that coinbase is servicing will keep their coins on exchange since it is insured. They probably don't even know enough about wallets let alone segwit enabled wallets will not bother to move it. In terms of business strategy you should focus on objectives that are more important like their capacity for new users, etc. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:07:37
Ok I've posted a new discussion
Edit: Also is segwit's softfork consider a new network because the consensus rules was changed? Since node can chose to accept it or not.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:54:26
How does soft forking affect the original chain? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:28:48
My doubts are with this current fee problem and the rational side is finally waking up on this sub... and saying bitcoin cannot be only a store of value and that maybe we can increase blocksize... What was the point of the no2x promotion then? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:59:30
Alright man good luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:06:43
I'm not asserting anything... I'm just wondering why people are trying to change the whitepaper instead of publishing an updated one. How is the network new? Don't all the miners share the same hashpower? They can choose to go switch at any time right? Also was ethereum classic a non-contentious fork? 
Edit: I think I might have not been clear... my apologies. I meant people are literally trying to change the white paper, the original copy and posting it on bitcoin.org (the one that is encode as a pdf into the blockchain). I wasn't trying to say that bitcoin has changed from the whitepaper.
@_date: 2017-12-15 13:50:28
God this is so desperate I don't even know what to say any more... How is this wallet a scam?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:19:33
We should be thanking coin base for what it has done for bitcoin and litecoin... There was no way that prices would have gotten this high (20k and $400) without coinbase... Why are you so upset now just because there is a new competitor?
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:44:13
By small blocksize increase do you mean the 300 MB required for lightning network for global adoption (a problem we don't even need to solve yet let alone on a imaginary network)? I just find a lot of people here can't admit that they were misled and finally recognize the fee problem that could have been solve with just increased blocksize that could have been done years ago (a tiny 1 mb increase). Any additional solutions can come later (with less pressure and with consensus) not a "soft fork" with 15% adoption and users screaming at exchanges to add it. Now the narrative switches to we need "increased blocksize with segwit"... Just a bit annoyed by that fact.
@_date: 2017-12-09 15:47:05
Does the user need to open a channel every time you want to make a payment to someone or is it 1 channel per merchant (or recipient) which everyone can use? Who opens the channel, the sender or recipient? How much does it cost to open/close a channel? Are the fees replaced by cost to open a channel? Is there a limit to how many channels can be opened? Thanks. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:48:02
How does an indirect connection work?
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:24:02
We can't provide any actual evidence because the lightning network doesn't exist yet aside from alpha. Its all theoretical. The only reason bitcoin cash forked was because they wouldn't increase the block size. Camp 4 is gaining influence because people are starting to see bitcoin cash as a real threat and not a scam coin. All I'm saying now is it too late? Will miners all come to a consensus? Will the supporter view this new direction as bad considering the no2x promotion? How long will it take to implement? Why not just switch to BCH? Can BCH ever add second layer solutions as well similar to segwit? All this could have been avoided before the august 1 fork.    
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:36:45
I think he was just trying to be consistent? He didn't mention any coins that was going to be added on the news and the email sent prior clearly stated that only withdrawals will be taken place in January. What difference would it have made if he announced it 4 days earlier? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:02:54
we are so fucked this isn't a joke, once we break a certain price point for bitcoin the fees and difficulty will make it impossible to mine profitably especially when miners run off to bch...

12% adoption says to me that it is complicated enough that people don't want to opt in despite this fee problem on bitcoin. Graphene protocol and various things undiscovered can be used as additional scaling options. Right now all we need is a blocksize increase not segwit. Also just found out that lightning can be used on bitcoin cash without segwit so there goes your savior. $20000 dollar servers or regulated bank lightning hubs (Want to see the future of lightning hubs? Look at what exchanges are now with increasing regulation) or do you have an idea to scale with segwit and not lighting network? You can cherry pick my arguments and use personal attacks all you want but the truth remains. Anyways good luck with your segwit. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:49:15

Hmm... but what if its projection projection? How do we know who is doing the projecting?

EVERYTHING IS A CONSPIRACY AHHH
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:17:04
I'm grasping at straws? I clearly stated the ones that are tech and are not. Lower fees is the result of the underlying tech...  Why do you think segwit (over complicated) is better than block size (simple) increase? Yes please dismiss all the points that have relevance then call my argument grasping at straws...
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:24:13
Lightning network? When did I mention that? It won't work without large bank hubs because you need multiple channels loaded with predetermined amounts for it "network part" to work properly... You can't if a route/hop from you to a merchant doesn't have sufficient funds in between. It becomes much more possible with large bank hubs with alot of liquidity to make it 1 hop away. Opening and closing a lightning channel is just like doing an on chain transaction and if all the people in the world were to open 4 channels to allow sufficent "networking" on a 1mb block size for the hops then it would like like 50 years...

But you just said the other coins have considerably less hashrate so how is it "puny"? 
Can you please explain why its crippled? 
People can lose money holding any crypto... Everything can tank to zero the next day, never invest more than you can afford to lose... 
Doesn't bitcoin and bitcoin cash share the same mining pools using sha256?
I've introduced many people to crypto and they always ask me what is bitcoin cash and they don't associate it with bitcoin especially after they see the price
I thought bitcoin cash survived through eda and real hashpower unlike bitcoin gold, diamond, etc after august 1 fork which were actually premined? 
If coinbase enables bitcoin cash will the newcomers try to buy it as the "cheap" bitcoin like they did with litecoin, will it nullify the new flood of bch from holders pre august fork?
 
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:21:20
dude its over... while btc and bch were fighting the banks were planning the take over with ripple. We got fucken blindsided
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:05:58
There was no reason to make segwit a soft fork then. If people have to use it to avoid high fees then they have no choice. Don't make it seem like a good thing that people can "choose" whether or not to use segwit or lightning network... Who would intentionally want to pay high fees? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:00:38
If say you go to a new store that you don't frequent do you have to open a new channel if that merchant isn't using it? How long does it take to open a channel? What are the fees?

dude ripple is partnering with SBI for 61 banks in Japan, ripple is going to drain bitcoin's marketcap
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:31:01
We are defending coinbase because they are bringing crypto to the mass adoption. They definitely helped the space... Right now all I see on the front page is biase people shitting intentionally on coinbase because they added bitcoin cash. What happened yesterday was unfortunate but when they are growing at the rate they are growing with high demands for adding alts and infrastructure, etc I think they should be given a break... 
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:33:56
Hash power is 7% now, but isn't that 7% of total hash power for bitcoin? How much hash power is that relative to litecoin?
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:10:39
I'm not referring to price those are assigned values based on speculation not adoption... Even Vitalik Buterin questions if we earned it.
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:25:03
Where are you reading that you need segwit for lightning? Also during the time it was $300-$400 btc ranged from $4000 to $6000 so thats around 0.05 to 0.1 BTC. At best they broke even at current rates but they likely would of lost out on being able to sell at 2k + and buying back in to btc at .5... Logically its more safe to hold both as a hedge. If it was really a pump the price should have retraced back to $300 no?  
Edit: I think i got confused with LN, nvm.

Why is the price 10% of bitcoins while the hash power is only 3%? Does this mean that its better to mine bitcoin cash? I heard that lightning network can be used on bitcoin cash and it will work better because it has bigger blocks. Also doesn't second layer segwit scale exponentially with block size so bitcoin cash can actually implement it? I thought premining meant giving developers the unfair advantage, but in this case everyone got equal share? What about all the people who sold their bitcoin cash when it was $300 don't you think they missed out?

It wasn't really an surprise people had 5 months to prepare including those that were "ready to dump bitcoin cash the second it hit coinbase". Coinbase looks out for its customer and should be respected more... remember that eth flash crash and they refund everyone? Also any exchange that has dumped their bch for btc when it was around 1k probably have very unhappy customers right now. It was also most definitely a political stance... Also people weren't condemning coinbase when it brought bitcoin to 20k were they? What about them bringing litecoin to 400? Now we have some new competition when they add bitcoin cash and they scream insider trading and shit like that... 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:32:05

And people will start pumping it over the course of a week. Did you see what happen to XRP in rumor of coinbase adding? It nearly tripled and stayed up there. A early coinbase announcement would make no difference, we expected it on January 1st anyways... its 2 weeks early christmas gift.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:14:00
Segwit was a softfork so that means nodes have to update their software, but they don't need to use segwit right? I'm curious why segwit adoption is low despite this fee pressure and soon there won't be a choice. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:30:05
If bitcoin had upgraded block size does that mean you truly don't need to move it? Or do you need to do something with the wallets?
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:38:07
I'm confused as to why it becomes an alt? Doesn't ethereum hardfork all the time to upgrade? I'm not trying to redefine anything, I'm just wondering why the store of value is being pushed and people are suggesting to rewrite the whitepaper for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:55:57
Uh we are talking about blockchain right? My doubts are if we can call bitcoin with segwit the real bitcoin. Right now bitcoin with 1mb is the real bitcoin. There was never really an arguement, I was just asking questions.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:38:11
-Much lower fees 
-Cash shuffle for privacy 
-No segwit (segwit over complicates everything and adds additional vulnerabilities, when you engineer something... more moving parts = more points of failure)
-serious scaling research/development by nChain (gigablock testnet) 1.5 million funding 
-bitcoin cash has more network effect... adoption rate is exponential (compare to how old litecoin is) in 5 months added to almost all popular exchanges added bitcoin cash including coinbase
-72 litecoin address control 46.5% of all coins (which one is more likely the chinese coin controlled by whales?) 
-Litecoin "figure head" has no confidence in litecoin and sold all his litecoins right before bitcoin cash (real competitor) launches
@_date: 2017-12-16 01:11:20
Doesn't bitcoin cash have a longer chain or is the current larger block number not it? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:29:36
So its at least a year late and is only in alpha? Running on main net doesn't mean we can use it though right? Segwit adoption is only 15% after like 4 months.
