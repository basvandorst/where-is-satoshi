Ha! My bad, thank you. I originally searched the page for FSF, but I must not have searched for "free software foundation".

I thought this would be useful for folks looking for "brick &amp; mortar" places to spend Bitcoin in/near the Seattle area.
I apologize in advance if this is considered spam. If you feel it is, just say so in the comments. Enough negative comments and I'll delete the post.

Woah, that's funny, I just noticed [the same thing]( and I asked about it on  (IRC).
    [22:39] &lt; meonkeys&gt; Why does this post say 11 comments, but only 3 appear for me? 
    
    [22:40] &lt; meonkeys&gt; 
    [22:40] &lt; Lucifer7&gt; bunch of them deleted?
    [22:42] &lt; meonkeys&gt; oh, huh
    [22:42] &lt; meonkeys&gt; maybe
Oh, just got another reply...
    [23:09] &lt; justache&gt; meonkeys, I've come across that "bug" in my own subreddits. 
                        It's either because a mod removed the comments, or it's 
                        shadowbanned accounts commenting in them.

Sounds like rock gym admission (or payment for coffee or gas) can reasonably be accepted *unconfirmed*.
"...retailers can accept unconfirmed transactions with very little risk by simply 'listening' on the network for a double-spend transaction, or partnering with a company that provides this service"
