LN is a payment layer that is solved on Bitcoin's blockchain, it is not a blockchain itself.
LN is private as in protecting your privacy, it is open source and anyone can run a node.

LN is a optional layer over Bitcoin, Bitcoin is decentralized. A large LN node will only serve to help the network because the power it has over the network is not centralized, if it goes down, blocks channels, or charges high fees then your payment will just be routed around it. If there is no route you can open a channel with another node, or anyone can easily create a new needed node.
It is peer2peer because the LN nodes only serve as nodes, just like sending your bitcoins over the network travels through multiple nodes.
@_date: 2018-01-21 07:18:23
I don't think cheap tx will slow the LN growth because LN gives us instant tx compared to on chain and opening new channels will be cheap to do also.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:00:08
You can also send multiple payments till you reach your total.

 As Bitcoins adoption grows it will most likely stabilize, but it is a brand new technology that will have a bigger impact than the internet has, so it is hard to say what will happen.
Digital currency backed by gold would in no way compete with Bitcoin because the purpose of Bitcoin is decentralization with no middle man so it cannot be controlled by banks/governments.
Digital gold has to be centralized and run through a middle man so it would be easily controlled and abused by banks/governments.
I highly suggest keeping and open mind and actually learn about the technology then make a informed decision. I suggest watching this video, he hits directly on some points in our argument:

You have the mindset of extreme bigotry.
You are desperately twisting reality to say Bitcoin is a non-existent enterprise, no real point in debating somone who rejects reality and substitutes thier own.
You expect a brand new currency to be instantly stable? Gold is not even stable, it swings often. Bitcoin does what gold cannot, it is a decentralized currency that cannot be controlled, shutdown, and competes with banks in the modern age. It is the people who believe in the freedom this technology is giving us who have invested in it. Some others have invested in it to get rich, but you see all over Bitcoin enthusiasts saying don't invest in it unless you believe in the technology.
My guess is you are just an angry brat throwing a tantrum because you feel like you missed out on something big. There are always opportunities, however an attitude like yours destroys them.
Well I guess no point in wasting time with you, this is all just a digital conversation and by your logic that means it does not exist.....
@_date: 2018-01-18 09:30:39
My bad, I was thinking of ponzi scheme, just got done debating someone on that.
Bitcoin is NOT a Pyramid Scheme, it is supply and demand, your logic would say gold is a pyramid scheme also.
Here is the definition of Pyramid Scheme: "A form of investment (illegal in the US and elsewhere) in which each paying participant recruits two further participants, with returns being given to early participants using money contributed by later ones."
Thier is no required recruiting and there is no paying recruiters money, Bitcoin is just a simple supply and demand product.

Incorrect! You can keep a channel open indefinitely and send as many transactions you want through it.
@_date: 2018-01-11 03:23:34
No for many reasons, one simple reason is it does not matter how big the blocks are, they will never give you instant transactions that LN does.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:38:39


This is exactly what I said!
So if bob wanted to give the coffee shop a total of 1 BTC he will just simply make 20 payments of 0.05 BTC, 0.05 * 20 = 1. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 00:29:35
Not sure what you are talking about.
The node will pay the payee 0.1 then the payer will pay the node 0.1; this can then be done multiple times rapidly, even with multiple channels running payments through the node.
@_date: 2017-12-30 17:53:04
LN is not a replacement of the blockchain but is a layer over it. Consolidated LN transactions are still validated on the blockchain and miners collect the fees.
A white paper is just a baseline start to development, it is not some religious document you must adhere to.
Satoshi was all for off chain scaling solutions, he was looking in to possible solutions himself.
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:28:46
People will still use LN when the chain fees are low because LN gives you near instant transactions where chain is  at best updated every 10 minutes.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:56:52
Bitcoin has on chain scaling with Segwit, with lightning it will have instant transactions, something Bcash can never do. In the future there is plans to increase Bitcoin's blocksize.
Bcash has sacrificed decentralization to only scale a little compared to Bitcoin once Segwit is fully adopted. I would hardly call the superior.

It would take an incredible amount of energy to make an EMP large enough to even effect a small portion of the planet.
Think of the way how an EMP works, it is an electromagnetic pulse that induces voltage in a wire the same way how moving a magnet over a wire induces voltage in a wire. The longer and bigger the wire the more voltage, the smaller and shorter the wire the less voltage.
The only real thing that could be damaged by a powerful EMP is the power grid and potentially anything that is plugged in to it because of the miles of wire. Modern electronics like your laptop, phone, and especially your thumb drive would be unaffected by even a very powerful EMP because the electronics are so small that the voltage induced in them would not be strong enough to cause any damage. Imagine how strong a magnetic field would have to be to induce 5v on a single wire that is only an inch long, many electronics have wires way shorter than that and the voltage would have to be higher than that in order to damage them.
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:12:17
Video is brainwashing by getting peoples thoughts locked in a box.
Decentralization does not mean big companies and banks cannot be part of the network, we want them to be part of it, it means they can't control it.
Large entities may create nodes with many channel connections and this is not bad at all, it will only help because they can't control the transactions moving through their node. They also have no power to stop anyone else from creating a node and opening channels to other nodes.
Now lets say a large bank has a node and they turn off their channel to Wikileaks, your transactions will just find a node that is linked and the bank will lose out on your transaction fee.
Also if the network ends up being like this you would have a huge opportunity to start a node, open just a couple channels with lower fees and you would reap huge rewards because of all the traffic that would route through you; Competition is key!
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:58:48
No, not at all! Reread what I said carefully.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:37:55
If you open a payment channel with a balance of 0.1 then you can send as many 0.1 payments you want over it, you just can't send a payment that is more than 0.1.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:40:11
You can send 1 BTC through a node that would have for example only 0.1 BTC. You just send 10 instant 0.1 transactions, wallets will probably do this automatically.
People who run nodes that have low amounts of BTC on it only have to run it with lower fees to compete with nodes that have more BTC. Your wallet will then choose the route that gives you the cheapest fee according to if your doing  small payments or large payments.
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:54:04
Anyone can create a low cost hub and choose a competitive fee; someone can run a LN hub on a raspberry pi that can compete with the largest hub in the world. So who exactly will LN be centralizing too? Is having large centralized miners a better option to you?
I really suggest you reread what you said about chain transactions and recognize the flaw in your logic ;)
Block mining difficulty adjusts. If the on chain transaction fees go higher then why wouldn't miners come back to mine them?
What is stopping miners from running LN nodes and mining blocks?
Don't you see the benefit in this decentralization?
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:08:36
People did not want to centralize Bitcoin by increasing the blocksize too quickly before getting more fixes and decentralized scaling solutions involved.
If bitcoin was not getting spam attacked and especially if people had adopted Segwit then the fees would not be an issue. Hopefully soon we Segwit adoption will happen quickly.
@_date: 2017-12-29 17:57:03
It would take a tremendous amount of energy to create an EMP to effect even a tiny portion of the globe.
An EMP does not work like how it does in the movies.
An EMP induces voltage in a wire the same way voltage is induced in a wire by moving a magnet across it.
Modern electronics are so small that the voltage induced in their circuits would be far too small to cause any damage, this makes them immune to even large EMP blasts.
Power lines can be damaged by an EMP blast because of the miles of cables they are running, but they have and are getting many safeguards.
@_date: 2018-05-12 19:00:24
Plase explain how all those different entities all control Bitcoin and make it centralized? Out of the many different exchanges, the hundreds of different miners, and the thousands of early adopters who are controling Bitcoin?
I think your just very confused, Look at the diversity of Bitcoin's nodes, this shows a partial amount of the nodes running: 
Bitcoin also has seconed layer solutions like lightning that already has thousands of nodes.
You do know that Segwit was adopted because the community faught and won against some of the big miners for it don't you?
@_date: 2018-05-14 06:09:08
Other currencies will most likely always exist. Becoming the one and only currency is not the intended goal of Bitcoin, it is to provide a currency where its power is in the hands of the people, so being tracable to proved forced taxation is against the spirit of Bitcoin.
Taxes have been successfully around long before money was ever tracable. Taxation is nothing more then theft backed by the threat of force. Only brainwashed slaves believe we need forced taxation for a fuctional sociaty, taxation is the blood needed by parasitic tyrants to stay alive.
Keep in mind that if a government does things to you without your consent then you are nothing more than a slave slave to them.
@_date: 2018-05-23 13:30:26
As he said Bitcion has implemented the lightning network that already overcomes this issue. It also has other scaling solutions already implemented with more on the way.
Sending bitcoins over the lightning network is faster and cheaper than nearly all the other coins if they even came close to the usage Bitcoin gets.

That site is only an opinion. That would only be very risky trading for them to do. Regardless if the supply dries up the price will go up, unless they somehow control all the exchanges and bypass all regulations.

LOL, this meme is very retarded and is a poorly attempted strawman that has no basis in reality. Anyone who can go do a little investigation knows Bitcoin has implemented many smart decentralizing scaling sutions eliminating the meed to currently inceease the blocksize, unlike Bcash that has stupidly increased the blocksize so much that you have to depend on centralization so it is no longer a blockchain but basically a centralized bank that is easily controlled.

To be straight I am all for government, but a government should be small and have no more power that an imdividual. Their job should be only to protect our rights. I am all for people giving money to the government, but it needs to be our choice, so if they start doing something we don't like then they don't get money.
Because Bitcoin is decentralized there is no entity for the government to attack to shut it down. They can try and make it illegal and ban it but that is the best they can do, most likely governments will just join in using it instead of risking misding out due to it being a huge change in the way money works. 
The IRS is a prime example of how enslaved we are, it is a privetly owned bank that overides the constitution by putting people in prison for having a debt and people are guilty until they can prove their innocence. If we are too afraid to do anything because they won't like it then we are already their slaves.

You have a very bigotry mindset. I, along with many people, got in to Bitcoin because we believe in it, not because we think it could make us rich. I first learned of Bitcoin after MT Gox when all the news was saying it was dead.
Bitcoin is getting easier, it is a new technology just as the internet was difficult to use for a long while after it first started.
Cheaper? What? Why would Bitcoin need to be cheaper for mainstream? In truth the opposite is true. You do understand that nobody needs to buy an entire Bitcoin because it is highly divisable right? That is like thinking gold cannot go manstream because a brick of gold costs too much, but you don't have to buy an entire brick because gold is divisable so you can buy it in coins. You can go buy some bitcoin for pennies if you wanted too, heck I could send you an amount of bitcoin worth far less than a single penny.

Then you would be an idiot. Do you think the dollar is required to give everything value or needed in order for you to be rich? Were there no rich people before there was ever fiat? If you ownd 10 bricks of gold would you not be rich because you don't have dollars?
The dollar does not give value and it is not needed to make you rich, the dollar is only a measure of value just as gold and Bitcoin are measures of value, they are tools for trade so we don't have to use the old barter system. Right now a candybar's value is worth $2.00, or currently around 0.00024 bitcoin because that is the value we give to the candybar. If the dollar's value went to zero that candybar would still be worth 0.00024 bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-05-13 16:59:00
This is just normal/needed supply and demand; It is the way Bitcoin needs to be, there is nothing wrong with it. Life and freedom is not fair, you will get nowhere hating people because trophies aren't given to each person regardless of what they have accomplished.
If you want everything to be fair then Bitcoin is definitely not for you, you should look in to government slavery for that.
As Bitcoin's adoption increases those with large amounts will make less noise, wealth spreads even from the rich, the rich are the ones who create paying jobs. They got thier deserved reward for helping build  Bitcoin or for taking a huge investment risk in Bitcoin. Later the bitcon rich will be those who provide needs, wants, and jobs for people.
@_date: 2018-05-17 04:49:42
You asking if the dollar's value is zero? It is simple math: Any number of dollars * 0 &lt; Value of candybar.
But in this situation I would just trade 0.00024 bitcoin for the candybar: 0.00024 btc = Value of candybar.
So:  Any number of dollars * 0 &lt; 0.00024 btc.

Privatization, nearly all of the best hospitals don't use tax payer money and many of the best successful schools are privatized and don't use tax payer money. Also people, especially when governments are not stealing their money, donate a lot of money to good/needed causes.
I suggest getting a realistic understanding of solar flares other than from Hollywood. But regardless, if some mythical insane disaster happens that somehow wipes out all electronics then fiat would be in the same boat.

Governments are the number one cause of poor people and without free handouts then people will have an incentive to get a job instead of staying poor. Also many people would be much better off if most their pay was not being taxed. Charitable instatues have been around helping people for a long time and when governments take them over they become way less efficient and help less people. Would it be right for your neighbor to come rob you the  give to the poor? If not then why is it right for governments? I am all for helping people but it needs to be a choice, forced to pay charity at gunpoint is no charity at all.
A bitcoin is higly divisable so there is no need to buy an entire coin. You can trade an amount of Bitcoin that is worth far less than a penny if you want to.
The question is like saying 1 brick of gold is worth $500,000 dollars so most people cannot afford to buy gold, but in truth someone can buy a gold coin for $100 just like someone can buy some bitcoin for $10.

How is holding and having full control over your money the same as a bank that holds and has full control over other peoples money?
People need and should have a savings, Bitcoin does not stop spending, it only enforces smarter spending; this was not a mistake, it was intended. You don't think someone who has a lot of Bitcoins will never use it to buy a house, car, clothes, food, pay medical bills, make donations, help family, or pursue hobbies? I think your making an issue out of something that is not an issue. Even if you get these mythical people who's entire life purpose is to just only hord bitcoins then it will only help to increase the value of your bitcoins. Mimicking gold by having a limited supply and demand is one of the primary purposes of Bitcoin, if that does not agree with you then you have the option to stick with government/bank controlled and regulated fiat.

Bitcoin fees had gotten high before Segwit and its scaling solutions were in effect, Bitcoin was also getting spammed. Do you understand what upgrading is? Bitcoin has been updated already with many scaling solutions and spamming it is far less effective, especially on the LN.
I suggest stop comparing Bcash now to what Bitcoin used to be, that is right out dishonest. Bcash has no advantages compared to Bitcoin now, the decentralized LN is faster and cheaper than Bcash can ever be.
What is the point of a centralized cryptocurrency? Why don't you stick with fiat if you believe in centralization, that is basically what a centralized cryptocurrency is.

Bitcoin is not having any speed issues because of its scaling solutions and the LN is thousands of times faster and cheaper to use than anything Bcash can even get close to.

The only thing that you might be able to do with 51% hash power is possibly double spend a transaction, so easentially you would be spending billions of dollers just to attempt double spending a single transaction, it most likey won't work.
Having 51% hash power won't give you any forking power over Bitcoin, anyone can easily make a fork. What you would need is the support of the comminty to run nodes/miners with your forked software, once you change the supply limit your software is incompatible with the current running nodes.
So even with the majority of the hash power if you fork the software your new coin could just die if nobody runs nodes that support your fork. If you run nodes yourself then all your doing is running a centralized forked coin. 
So you cannot kill or take over Bitcoin because it is founded and controlled by the community. You can fork it, maybe get some of the community to follow you at best, and that has already happened.
It all boils down to what the community decides to support.
