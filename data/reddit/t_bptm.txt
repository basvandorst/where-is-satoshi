Both, but as far as I know nobody is working on second layer with cash. 
There's [graphene]( which I think is the most promising for reducing bandwidth usage.
Other work is being done to allow for more parallelization which should allow for nodes to deal with bigger blocks as well. [This presentation]( on 1GB blocks has some info on where it's currently at and what needs to be done to support them in the future. 
I think it'll work somewhat similarly to other computationally heavy projects: hardware will double every year or two and algorithms will do the same (at least for a few years).

How do you figure? All miners have a good connection already. I'd be surprised if the vast majority didn't already have 1gbps connections, let alone 100mb. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:23:42
Few comments:
Bitcoin Cash actually lets miners choose the size through consensus, though a default is set to 8mb. There was just a 2mb block mined a little bit ago with 1300 transactions. 50k transactions is actually 1000x the size of 8mb blocks -&gt; about 8gb. 8gb will seem like 8mb in a "few" years. The idea for bitcoin cash scaling assumes technology will continue to get better, in conjunction with on chain optimizations. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 20:31:16
That's fine. Do whatever you want. Bitcoin is already "centralized" by a development team that has refused anything other than their "solution" which requires everyone to pay $10+ fees. And that's gonna grow a lot too. Maybe having a development team where many of the people are employed by a company that has a financial incentive to not scale bitcoin on-chain is a bad idea.

With a higher blocksize there would be jack for backlog. utxo is a big one yea, but at 3gb right now I'm not really too concerned... a higher utxo is not a bad thing, it means more people are using bitcoin. Almost 10 years of bitcoin and it's reached only 3gb. My computer from like 5 years ago had 32gb, newer desktops can do 64gb, 128gb ram sticks now exist (though still expensive). But how long until a 128gb stick costs $200? My point is, the growth of ram is consistent enough I don't think it's much of a worry for years even assuming bitcoin had absolutely explosive growth today. 


Right. End users don't need full nodes, they can get by with light clients and still be secure. Miners with their multiple thousand dollar asics can certainly afford good nodes. Pooled miners don't need full nodes. 
And you wouldn't be running a vps for this.. it would be a server in the miners datacenter. 


Well, if it can support 100x growth from now I think that gives us a "few" years heh. By then doing another 10x growth isn't hard. But I think the part you might be overlooking... we don't even need 100mb blocks right now. 4mb blocks would be enough probably for the next year or two. 10mb would take us to another year or two past that. 10mb is only 500gb per year, in other words... not a real issue unless the goal is more pointless non-mining raspberry pi nodes. 


Asicboost is just an optimization. Any other hardware developer can [implement]( it, the developers of it are happy to be hired to help to implement it. It's not different than any other manufacturing optimization. The same logic could be used to consider gpus or asics themselves an attack.
[This transactions chart]( shows growth of transactions per day. We probably wouldn't need 100mb for another 5-8 years. Definitely will never need it if bitcoin doesn't scale. 


Well, ok. I hope you read more into it and see there is a solution. Without something changing bitcoin will die, and I'm pretty skeptical with how long lightning has taken that it will actually become usable in time. I don't think people will want to pay $20 to open and $20 to close their payment channels, and this might just be the beginning.

Right. That's what I mean-- trustless cash. 


Because we don't need 300mb blocks right now. 


An average (ie $1000) computer can handle 100mb blocks now. Years ago an average computer could handle 10mb blocks. In a few years an average computer could handle 1gb blocks. If you've read at all on the 1gb block test it's already pretty close. 
But on `easily affordable computer and connection` the idea was that bitcoin miners would provide the nodes to support the network. It is utilizing economics to grant a reward for a responsibility. They can certainly afford 1gbps connections and $1000 computer lol. 


Coordinating a takedown of hundreds (thousands?) of mining operations across numerous countries would be fun to figure out. I'd "like" to see the US start taking down mining operations in China, and likewise heh. It'd never be possible as long as there isn't a one world government. BRICS seems to support that it'd be difficult. Satoshi wasn't an idiot, almost the entirety of what he wrote has been correct. If central banks wanted to destroy bitcoin they'd just restrict the block size until it died from being unable to accommodate more users. That's a lot easier than conducting raids in numerous countries.

@_date: 2017-12-07 20:15:09
It can be phased in, like:
if (blocknumber &gt; 115000)
    maxblocksize = largerlimit
It can start being in versions way ahead, so by the time it reaches that block number and goes into effect, the older versions that don't have it are already obsolete.
When we're near the cutoff block number, I can put an alert to old versions to make sure they know they have to upgrade.


































Long before the network gets anywhere near as large as that, it would be safe 
for users to use Simplified Payment Verification (section 8) to check for 
double spending, which only requires having the chain of block headers, or 
about 12KB per day.  Only people trying to create new coins would need to run 
network nodes.  At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the 
network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to 
specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.  A server farm would 
only need to have one node on the network and the rest of the LAN connects with 
that one node.
The bandwidth might not be as prohibitive as you think.  A typical transaction 
would be about 400 bytes (ECC is nicely compact).  Each transaction has to be 
broadcast twice, so lets say 1KB per transaction.  Visa processed 37 billion 
transactions in FY2008, or an average of 100 million transactions per day.  
That many transactions would take 100GB of bandwidth, or the size of 12 DVD or 
2 HD quality movies, or about $18 worth of bandwidth at current prices.
If the network were to get that big, it would take several years, and by then, 
sending 2 HD movies over the Internet would probably not seem like a big deal.

@_date: 2017-12-08 03:05:32
There is a persistent lie that bitcoin cannot scale. It can scale just fine on chain. I'm not against 2nd layer, but it's completely unncecessary to scale, and I'm not ok with bitcoin being hijacked and crippled under obviously false pretenses to force all users onto 2nd layer. There is 0 need for 10000 raspberry pi "full nodes" which do nothing other than pretend to mine. 1gbps networks are available for miners today and that is far more than they need. 


Do you really think someone cannot manage to store a few gb in ram? The only threat from mempools getting big are the out of control fees due to an intentionally weakened system. Bitcoin functioning normally would not have this issue. The only potential issue could be a giant utxo set... but that would be success, not failure, and the price would reflect that making it worth it for miners to pick up a few extra sticks of ram lol.
Bitcoin can do 100mb blocks today. It could do 10mb years ago. This doesn't even require any sort of expensive setup, an average "work" pc could handle it... not even expensive servers. Not like it'd matter anyways, miners are the only ones who need to run "full nodes" and they have the money for good machines. Like Satoshi said, if you wanted to detect double spends all you need is the block headers which are nearly small enough to fit on floppy disks for a year heh. 
Do you have any idea the requirements needed for 100mb blocks? It's a 6tb harddrive per year assuming they are completely full, and 2 minutes per day (assuming completely full) to download with 1gbps. The upload bandwidth is basically inconsequential at this speed unless you somehow make the mistake of purchasing crappy home connection internet for your server farm with 100+ mining machines :/ 
By the way, 100mb blocks allow for around 65 million transactions per day. This is very close to Visa level. 
In a few years 10gbps will be as cheap as 1gbps is today so moving to 1gb blocks wont be hard either.

@_date: 2017-12-20 23:04:22
Then you disagree with Satoshi, because in his whitepaper he makes no distinction between nodes and miners. There is next to 0 network benefit to decentralization by non mining nodes, they do not secure the network, they do not participate in consensus, all they do is eat up actual nodes (miners) bandwidth. If you want to ensure double spends aren't possible you can use spv which takes just a few kb irregardless of blocksize.

Well, I'm not a crypto noob... I've been using Bitcoin for years. I buy things with it, I've paid people with it, I've gotten paid with it, I've helped people implement it onto their site... for years. Since your idea of bitcoin is "hodl" then you wouldn't understand. I've had multiple months I've paid over $100 in transaction fees. Now, I don't pay people in bitcoin, I don't get paid in bitcoin, and I'm stopping buying everything with bitcoin since it is too expensive. That's a success, right? The only way to reduce fees from here on out is for less people to use Bitcoin.
And calling everyone else a shill isn't very good argument. It has no merit. You can get all emotional but it's pretty childish and only reinforces that whatever you are saying is probably wrong if I had to judge the quality of your arguments by the quality of your ability to interact with people.

The retarget time if 95% quit immediately after retarget would then take about 40 weeks, and in the meantime you'd get a block every 3 or so hours. Because of the 1mb limit fees would skyrocket (to handle this at same level as today you'd need 20mb blocks).
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:03:32
Satoshi envisioned nodes being miners, the whitepaper is pretty clear about this. 
Past that, 8gb is more than we'll need for a looooong time. To handle Visa level you only need around 250mb blocks which ends up being about 13tb per year. You can get a 10tb hdd for about $300 right now.

Ok? That's fine. 1gb blocks are almost ready now and wont be needed for years anyways. 


What resource overhead? I think you don't understand how mining works... the amount of extra effort for mining larger blocks is trivial compared to the act of actually finding the target. 


No it can't. Companies and users are dumping bitcoin because it is essentially unusable. Bitcoin cash should hopefully help to alleviate this issue, which was completely predictable, and warned about for years. If anything the bitcoin cash crowd should be angry at the core/segwit group for repeated lying and essentially wrecking public perception of bitcoin by allowing fees to become $20. Luckily most people just want cryptocurrency to succeed, and central banking to fall. And it will. 


There is no differentiating between node and miner in the whitepaper. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:35:39
ie it doesn't fix it. You could make the argument that using it yourself could lower your own fees some percentage, however you can't force others to use it... so it doesn't work to actually lower fees to levels that aren't shit. 
But to play along, say these companies started using segwit and it was true that this extra blocksize from segwit allowed another few months before the transactions per second became larger than what bitcoin can support again. You end up with the same issue, it is effectively a 2mb blocksize increase assuming everyone switches... which they wont.
Even then, 2mb isn't much though, certainly not enough to give time for lightning to become useful if it even is able to garner any real marketshare which I'm pretty skeptical of. Real scaling needs regular blocksize increases to account for greater usage. Users and businesses can't be blamed for using Bitcoin as they have in the past... "you do not break userspace" is a pretty good mantra-- and it has been intentionally broken. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:02:51

Only mining nodes contribute to verifying transactions in any meaningful way. What will the raspberry pi verification be-- just the node forking off as the miners continue on what they determine to be the correct chain. I can't believe your comment is upvoted, it is spectacularly incorrect. The main innovation of bitcoin is the blockchain/nakamoto consensus, using nodes in the way you mean is the exact same as all legacy peer to peer systems which bitcoin supersedes. 


Fees being high is the status quo, it isn't a prerequisite and bitcoin functions better if the people in the places of the world you are referencing can actually use it. The concept that someone can afford multiple dollars to send money yet can't afford any more than a $30 computer is asinine.

It's approximately the same effect as a user who doesn't have a non-mining node not using them and moving to another fork or out completely. What is the actual technical power a non-mining node provides? There is none that is provided to the network in general, any benefits are solely for you or your organization to be able to verify blocks yourself. Any attack on bitcoin will only be able to be countered by mining nodes. 


You'd be better off putting $100 into a mining node, then 100% of your funds are being used to vote the way you want. Your $80 does not vote. If you argued putting $100 towards pool mining then I guess that'd be valid. Since you already stated you trust slush you can just follow whatever they say the blockchain is. But this is about as "trustless" as running a non-mining node effectively is, and not really decentralized. 


Well, that's ok. Luckily with bitcoin we don't have to agree, consensus is reached regardless of personal opinions (: I do highly recommend you read the [whitepaper]( over again as it makes a very clear and concise argument for why what I am saying is factually correct. It doesn't even distinguish between miner and node, they are considered one in the same. 


The same reason dictatorships run ads telling populations to vote. It's a control mechanism to placate people so they don't do the things that would actually matter. Bitcoin hasn't been a tiny project for a while, it has enough momentum that central bankers and their government goons will be trying to subvert it to maintain their power. There is a good amount of evidence that this has been ongoing for years, and is really no surprise. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 05:21:28
Just to show how little power they have... how would they fork? They have 0 hashrate, they can't even fork by themselves. All they can do is stay on a stale fork. The entire design of bitcoin is to remove the need for the "Vote on feels" and backs it by 1 cpu 1 vote. 


The only users that matter per consensus with Bitcoin's design is miners. You aren't running a node as described in the whitepaper, it is hardly useful for decentralization- I'm not sure if it's actually useful at all.
If you want to contribute to decentralization start mining, because regardless of what anyone says non-mining nodes have effectively 0 actual say in consensus, voting, or ability to fork.

@_date: 2017-11-23 07:55:00
There is no defining a peer as a non-mining node in the whitepaper. There is no distinction between node and miner in the whitepaper. 


Which again, makes no difference. There could be 1 million non-mining nodes all running a forked bitcoin software, it wouldnt matter since nothing is being mined ie that chain is as good as not existing. 


Hedging? That isn't hedging. Did you miss the part about how I said it isn't very good for decentralization if that is your only goal if someone uses a pool?


I never said that. But hopefully we can eliminate the central bankers grip by going outside their system. 
Anyways, this conversation is going in circles. I'm not going to spend more time explaining the same thing over and over again, especially if you start creating definitions out of thin air and using strawmen... that is a sign you are wrong, and you should recognize that instead of digging your heels in- it doesn't help you.

@_date: 2017-11-27 21:56:21
Your comment is wrong in many places. 
Segwit is less efficient (space wise) for normal transactions. People thought that penalizing people who wanted to use bitcoin as is shouldn't be still stuck on the 1mb chain. Why not just do a blocksize increase for all users, instead of what seems to be forcing people onto using lightning. 
Lightning network only needs malleability fix, it doesn't require segwit. Why else would lightning work on testnet over a year ago without segwit? 
The mods of this subreddit appear to use selective enforcement of the rules, engage in very interesting patterns of deletion, and are quite banhappy. That old "To learn who rules over you, simply find out who you are not allowed to criticize" - criticism of core or blockstream or segwit is simply not tolerated. Many people who are in are not a fan of bitcoin developers being on the payroll of major banking interests. Nor are they in approval of having theymos be in control of moderation, someone who managed to pilfer 6000+ bitcoins from the community. It is pretty easy to see why a large percentage of the bitcoin community would not be privy to these sorts of things.
You would know this, as you are a mod yourself. Why don't you open the moderation logs, it would put a lot of people to rest. Censorship resistance starts with transparency.
@_date: 2017-11-22 06:44:47
Well sure, users do matter. I never implied that they didn't. But that has 0 to do with what sort of non mining node they run as far as consensus. They matter about as much as users of any software saying they would prefer if it functioned differently, and would be willing to switch if someone made something that functioned differently. 


It does matter for decentralization. Do you not see the paradox here? You are saying that running a small non-mining node which has 0 effective power for voting on consensus matters, yet a small mining node which has _some_ effective voting power does not matter. The power wasted argument even more so. 


If 99% went to bitcoin cash bitcoin would not be able to mined reasonably. There is a 2 week retarget time, this would turn into a 1-2 year retarget time if 99% switched at the beginning of a retarget. You are right 1% can fork fine and leave both chains working. 


Yes, it does. Because it has something actually backing the votes, instead of giving a "vote" to every thing with a semi-detectable pulse. The innovation is in this voting system. Have you ever considered that the people trying to convince others that non-mining nodes have any sort of actual voting power maybe have some other reason why they are pushing a narrative which is contradictory to the fundamentals?

Let's do some math..
You could go to 100mb blocks, have them be completely full every single block, and the entire storage would amount to a little over 5tb a year. In other words, $0.50 a day of storage costs as you can buy a 6tb harddrive for $150. A 100mbit connection would be more than enough to keep up. 
In other words, a good consumer pc loaded up with harddrives with a decent connection could store the blockchain with 100mb blocks for 8 years. 
100mb isn't needed right now, in fact- 4mb would likely be fine for another year or so. This was just to illustrate the hyperbole of "a whole room" of harddrives. I wonder what $150 will buy you in 2025 for harddrive space, I'd guess at least 50tb.
If you think 100mbit connection is crazy, look at Tor for how well volunteers around the world manage to support the network with speeds of at least that... bitcoin even moreso. There are universities, businesses, and people with awesome home networks who are more than capable of 100mbit.. everywhere. 1gbps for consumers is being rolled out. 1tb bandwidth costs $2-5. 
The idea that computers cannot support a few mb of blocks is factually wrong. 10mb blocks that are completely full would be able to be stored on a single 6tb harddrive for the next 10 years. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:50:07


They would increase in _storage_ size every year or so to keep up with general trend of improvements in technology.. lol.


100mb can service really a large amount of transactions. To service the world as one of the main currencies you'd need around 10gb blocks-- I'll show you below.  But 100mb can probably get us through the next 10 years. 
The idea that decentralization=a ton of people running raspberry pi's is incorrect, only mining nodes matter for decentralization to any real degree. A 1gbps connection could download a years worth of full 100mb blocks in about 12 hours, so not bad. If you do 1gb blocks you can do normal Visa level completely on chain, 300 million transactions per day. That's something to strive for, and another order of magnitude is probably enough for servicing the whole world (as some people will want to use other currencies). Right now to go to 10gb blocks requires ~25k per year so I think we need to wait a few years for that to be more accessible.. but not too far off. I'd expect in 20 years the hardware cost for that to be quite cheap, 20 years ago 1gb was around $400 so that would mean storing the current 1mb blocks for a year would cost ~$20k. Funny how that works heh. 1gb blocks we could probably go to right now if there was an actual need for it, but really we only need maybe 4mb-8mb atm. 
This is assuming no other technology breakthroughs and that lightning or sidechains are not used at all. If they are you can probably achieve ^^ a little quicker. I have my doubts lightning will ever come to fruition because I think it has fundamental design flaws that will turn users away from using it. 
There's some more information you might find useful in the [wiki]( which describes some other aspects.

You are describing a legacy p2p network. Bitcoin is not that. 


No, they don't. They simply follow them. Like I said above, if a node doesn't agree with what is being mined they will simply be on a fork. 


No, it doesn't. Nor was bitcoin ever designed to be that way. If so, it would be absolutely worthless. Perhaps you should do some reading instead of speaking with authority when you are so misinformed. 


leave and rejoin the network at will, accepting the proof-of-work chain as proof of what
happened while they were gone. They vote with their CPU power, expressing their acceptance of
valid blocks by working on extending them and rejecting invalid blocks by refusing to work on
them. Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism.
The consensus mechanism has always been designed for miners. That is the entire innovation of Bitcoin. Your ideas about how Bitcoin technically functions don't even make sense-- rhetorically: if non mining nodes dictated consensus then what is the point of miners? 


Yup, well, that's about it. The only nodes that actually matter for consensus are mining nodes. IF you understand how the blockchain works this is self evident and really just obvious.

Huh? Lightning isn't usable yet.

Do you think this is a reason why other wallets haven't yet implemented it as well?
