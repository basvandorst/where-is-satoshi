@_date: 2018-06-18 05:34:11
Lucky guess
@_date: 2019-08-15 13:47:14
The split I think your referring to last year was the bitcoin cash coin producing the BSV coin. 
  The halving is a feature within the bitcoin program that happens every 4 years by design the difficulty algorithm for these bitcoin miners goes up drastically,  reducing the supply flow of mined bitcoins in half.  This supply shock has led to humongous price spikes in the past halvings (2012 &amp; 2016). Next bitcoin halving is may of 2020. This upcoming halving will be exciting times for bitcoiners. 
Stop buying litecoin &amp; Ethereum, buy bitcoin before the halving next year while the price is still under 20,000

$1000, I would buy in now and let it roll until early 2121 and DCA a tiny bit from your weekly salary is what I would do.
@_date: 2019-02-26 00:53:12
I did not know that, so bitcoin would still be good for those of us left from the asteroid blast 
@_date: 2019-06-24 16:41:02
I   personally feel good about buying during the bear market, but I really wished I could of convinced some close friends to get in, its not as fun being right about a project/investment if you can't celebrate with people, when the price blew past $10,000. I literally had no friends to share my excitement with ....I only had my online twitter and reddit friends to celebrate with.
@_date: 2019-02-24 21:28:20
