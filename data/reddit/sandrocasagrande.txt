but u said a "certain" amount that u have probably in mind already no? if the answer to your post was "yes you can do that at x" you would have to decide what amount no?
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:51:49
i agree in these sense, plus what annoy me is that if you point this out people will automatically go rampage like "oh so ur saying she deserve it and the guy should not be arrested?!!!" and im like wtf no i didnt say that
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:11:50

Why a dick move, just an embarassing one. I know it's a stupid thing to do, but the the fact is that i have 20k fucking euros ready, earned tru 2 years of work after highschool and it's a nightmare getting them transfered to coinbase or bitfinex (not all of them at once ofc).
@_date: 2017-12-24 18:31:33
