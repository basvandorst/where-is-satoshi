You need to upgrade to using a Mar-a-lago resort to dodge taxes. That seems to work a lot better.

This is not a pop. A pop is when the price is anything &lt;$9k. FUD makes people crazy, its the exact same as the FOMO but in reverse. FUD plays into both futures and the coin market.

Guys lets take this moment to remember why we got into this. If it was to see this through and say fuck it to wall st. then HODL. If it was because you bought on a whim and just wanted to show off to your buddies after a drunk night at the bar, then sell. To be honest, it's gonna get a whole lot crazier from here. Big money is a 800 lb gorilla out to kill us all. Fuck them.

Ya they wouldn't cancel orders, that would be like deleting msgs out of your outbox. They would stop executing orders and just let the market catch its breath.
