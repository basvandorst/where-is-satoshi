Hijacking comment...
just noticed this thread and went to read some of his shit:








Would you consider someone foolish for spending $1.99 on a pack of gum instead of the cheaper .99 option? Your concept of money is one of a poor persons. You have an inflated view of $1000 that many of us do not have.


This guy is a perfect jerk, he doesn't recognize at all that he is now in debt towards his sister, he still believes that he he only may have to give her half of the remaining. I say may, because he mentions plenty of times that the contract he made with his father was verbal!
