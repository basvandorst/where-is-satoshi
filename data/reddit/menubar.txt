The people I know that are aware of Bitcoin won't touch it with a ten-foot-pole because of all the bad news surrounding it every day. A few have no idea where to get them. I know where to get them, but I sure as hell ain't meeting with a stranger in a back alley with money in my hand. So it's at best a curiosity, at worst a "beanie-baby" type collectable.

So, like Mt. Gox? I hear there's a Bitcoin ATM somewhere in Australia, but that's a bit of a drive from my house in the usa.
I'm sorry I sound bitter. Back when bitcoin was first announced and they were like 8¢ apiece, I set up a wallet with some service that threw in a few bonus coins on your first purchase. I put about 15 Bitcoins in my wallet and I think they gave me 3 more - I somehow remember the number being 18. The purchase was done using Paypal (as I recall) and my total came to less than a dollar. I had an interest in cryptocurrencies at the time, so I figured it'd be interesting to have a little loose change in bitcoins, just to say I had some.
Long time goes by and I don't hear much about bitcoin. Computers and harddrives come and go, and my wallet info is long gone by the time Bitcoin starts making waves. No use crying over spilled milk, as my "loose change" 18 long-lost bitcoins were heading towards $18,000 dollars worth, haha.
So, one day I decided to start a new wallet. I did some research on what people recommend, tried several services which a few days later, everybody is warning people away from that service/method. Drove me crazy, and I pretty much wanted to give up. But then, some generous redditor tipped me the minimum bitcoin (I forget, like .0000183 of a bitcoin or something). I figured it would be nice to have enough in my wallet to either tip others or maybe buy something real with them. I could probably afford like ten bucks a week to feed that kinda habit. 
Don't even get me started on how frustrated I got trying to find a way to just put like $10 bucks worth of bitcoin in my wallet. I was getting conflicting advice from twenty different directions. Maybe I'm TOO INTERESTED and I read too much about it, and there's a contrary view to every opinion on the internets. But it came to a "fuckit" point eventually, and I gave up.
I try to wrap my head around how people spend $20 worth of bitcoin when that $20 could be worth up to $40 the next day, or down below $10. Someone gets the shitty end of that deal either way. You can be pretty sure that guy that bought the first pizza with 15,000 bitcoins regrets letting go of them. So I began to view them akin to Beanie Babies; just a trendy collectable. It's a sad attitude for me, because I really would have liked to see it succeed and become ubiquitous. But unfortunately, even for someone like myself with a long-time interest in it, it's become quite a confusing quagmire that I don't even want to deal with anymore.

Another question I hope you can answer...
If MtGox got robbed, how can they sell coins so cheap? Wouldn't economics state that they should be more expensive due to scarcity? Where does Mt.Gox get cheap coins to sell?

My first time meeting someone to exchange money for bitcoins [felt a little different.](
@_date: 2014-03-23 00:10:21
7,500 Ls would be about $29.19, around $28.14 after selling on the exchange.
75,000 Ls would be more likely what the offer was.
I'm not familiar with who she is (musician, right?) but I would think if she's a popular musician in today's culture 750,000 Ls might be a reasonable offer.
But it depends on what kind of show - simply streaming a live gig via video into Second Life is pretty cheap. Musicians like Leanne Crow have done live shows in SL by either manipulating their avatar on stage or by hiring someone more skilled in SL to manipulate their avatar for them. That type of show takes a lot of practice and preparation and can run into some fairly large sums of money.

It boggles my mind that some people would be stupid enough to consider accepting Bitcoins as a long-term business plan.
Let's say 1 btc = $1,000 and you have 10 of them ($10,000).
You sell an item to someone for $2,000 (2btc).
You now have 12 btc ($12,000)
A week later Bitcoin drops to, say 1 btc = $500
Your customer comes back for a refund, so you refund him 4 btc ($2,000).
A week later Bitcoin goes back up to 1 btc = $1000
Now you have only 8 btc ($8000).
You've lost $2000 for having an honest return policy.
If I'm the only idiot that sees this, we're in serious trouble here.
@_date: 2014-04-18 13:29:13
Do you think that the value of BitCoins dropping from $1000.00 down to just over $300.00 had something to do with it?

Haven't been able to at all. 
Not gonna meet some stranger who knows I have money on my person in a clandestine meeting spot. Fuk dat.
I'd like to buy like maybe $10 bucks a week, but who's going to take chances like that for ten measly bucks?
I also don't want to send my credit card/bank account info to some sketchy kid's website.
So in answer to the question, ...I can't. 
Good luck to those of you who can.

That's how I was told personal transactions worked. 
You contact a seller, meet in an agreed location, give him money, he sends bitcoins to your wallet.
Although it sounds like fun, I'm just not socially inclined to [meeting new people that way](

This makes BitCoin a collectible - like Beany Babies.
@_date: 2014-09-22 15:18:05
I think a killer app for bitcoin would be not having to take cash to a stranger in a shady location to buy them.
I sell 3D content in Second Life, so I deal in "Lindens" on a regular basis. How do I buy them? I go to a marketplace website, type in how many I want (or how much money I want to spend on them) and VIOLA! The Ls are in my account. To sell them for cash is just as easy.
I don't know why buying BitCoin from a 3rd party has to seem to be so untrustworthy (security-wise) and couched in suspicion and mistrust.
Personally, I haven't been able to purchase any bitcoins due to this "security feature". As far as I know, there are no sites for purchasing them online that I trust enough to give my bank account or credit card info to and I sure as hell ain't meeting strangers in cafes with money in my pocket.

That's nice. I've been into Bitcoin for several years and have none.
1. Lost wallet with 18 coins on an old, dead computer. No great loss though. I think they were 18¢ each way back when I bought them.
2. About a year or two ago, some nice redditor tipped me about $2 worth of bitcoin. YAY! I'm back in the game! Not. No idea where that $2 worth are, or how I accessed them way back then. So, nope.
3. After reading and learning more and more about Bitcoin I realize I don't understand a fucking thing about them. Every time I think I understand something, the next thing I read is the opposite of what I thought I knew.
4. I have not found a SAFE method to invest in them that doesn't involve some creepy clandestine meeting with a stranger in a "safe" but private area of town, or won't get me locked out of my bank account for an assumed breach of some obscure law.
5. Oh so many ways to Bitcoin! Oh so many horror stories! What company is safe and what company is gonna fly away with my stuff? 
6. I know of no method or lifestyle I'd need to lead to ensure that I don't lose them or forget that long-ass string of numbers. One that doesn't have me put life aside and do nothing but bitcoin research, and thinking about Bitcoin every minute of every day. Would be nice to just buy some and be able to use them later when the opportunity arises or the value increases without going nuts trying to figure out where they are or what I need to do to access them, and after a few days of torment, finally deciding that a measly $2 ain't worth the trouble.
7. I'm sure people who have much more money than I are hoarding them and using their riches to manipulate the market to their advantage, leaving us lowly folk to gaze in wonder at the mysterious up and down fluctuations. 
8. And last but not least - who the hell spends $15 worth of coin on a pizza when that very $15 bucks can be worth $150 in a week or so? It's geniuses like that that are into it, so it doesn't lend much confidence.
I can see that there are some advantages to Bitcoin over fiat money, it's just that in several years following and cheerleading bitcoin, I realize I haven't used or benefited from it at all. But I'm sure your friends appreciate your efforts. Perhaps they'll buy drugs online before they forget how to use them, or where they are, or how to access them or - jeeze, do you guys have a term for this? Are lost coins forever dormant? Or do we not speak of such things here?

I just found something called CoinJar for iPhone. I haven't delved into it yet, but seems to do what a wallet should (has options for Account, Send, Addresses, and Fair Rate). Is CoinJar not trusted or something?

Yeah, I got into BitCoin early on when they were just a handful of pennies each. Lost interest after a while, and that was like 3 dead computers ago. I don't even remember what computer I had them on way back then.
I probably had 18 or so coins for that wallet on the long-dead machine. I sure wish I had 'em today.

Haha, yeah. I'm guessing I bought maybe 5-10 coins. They were cheap as small change, but I figured it would be beneficial to have a few in the account. Plus, if my memory serves me (I may be quite wrong), but I seem to remember receiving a couple free bonus "seed" coins for early adoption or whatever. Does that sound familiar?
I remember that I could mine coins by letting a program run all the time, but I think I lost interest in that early on; didn't check balance, quit running the program, etc.

A couple horrible newbie questions:
• I had several coins in a wallet on a machine that died several years ago. What happens to those lost coins?
• What happens to abandoned addresses (addresses with $0 balance)?

• I use an iPhone. How can I spend/exchange Bitcoins while away from my desktop?

Everybody said "don't trust online wallets" but most suggestions (Coinbase, etc) seems to force you to use online wallets.
And when I ask questions I either get some idiot that speaks english on a Youtube Comment level or an intensive course on cryptology and fiat currency that would make a Wall Street guru defenestrate his ass.
So do tell great shitcoin mindtrust, where do I put my entire fortune of $1 USD, 7 millionth whateverthefuck of a bitcoin (besides up my ass)?
EDIT: Yeah I'm pissed off! That's why I'm speaking on a YouTube Comment level. I mean, look at the fuckin' confusion in all the comments here alone! This is so far beyond ridiculous.
