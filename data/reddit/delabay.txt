There is something strangely disconcerting about those flimsy plastic tables.

Morons have a much greater market share than hackers

Check this out: 
This is a great sign for cryptos. One does not need to understand the technical details to benefit. This is a sign that cryptos are beginning to arrive. Rejoice!

Wow.. To me, these are the most telling graphs of all, never mind volume or market cap. Each one of these accounts with &gt;1BTC equivalent is an opportunity for a sale, transaction, donation, impact, reach, etc etc. Each account holder at a minimum is someone who **knows** what dogecoin is, recognizes the icon and participated in the community in one way or another. 
(Bitcoin) # Keys &gt; 1 BTC : 270,000
(Dogecoin) # Keys &gt; 1 BTC : 130,000
All signs that dogecoin is on the verge of majority market share. This is big. 
EDIT, I've made an interpretative mistake. They are counting account holdings proportional to 1BTC (equivalent to 4700 DOGE), obviously the *value* of the accounts are not nearly the same. A better value comparison would be 470000 DOGE to 1 BTC - in this comparison there are ~11,000 "1 BTC" dogecoin address holders versus the 270,000 1BTC address holders (a much more sane comparison all things considered).

No, they mean real companies with real liquidity needs. Real companies who want to offer real services while accepting bitcoin.

If you think money has been pouring into the market in the last few months, wait until institutional investors and heavy hitters can make a position. The drawback being, in order to manipulate such large quantities of money you have the play in the SEC sanctioned sandbox.

You're right, gains will be better. That's exactly what makes you an early adopter even five years after bitcoin was birthed.

the largest publicly traded company is worried BTC will harm its bottom line. The largest company in the US is threatened by Bitcoin. *The largest company in the US is threatened by Bitcoin.* 
Let that sink in

Dozens or hundreds of (IRL) currencies are traded on forex markets daily.

It takes courage to see past the immediate flaws of the system to visualize what it could be. The anchors saw a slow, cumbersome, ugly screen. The innovators saw instantaneous information exchange (that is, once the nerd hurdles were overcome). 
Just don't be that guy who said in the 1980s "Gah! The nerve of somebody looking up a recipe without even knowing what a TCP/IP stack is!"

Been a fan of coinbase for a while. A home town favorite, and recipient of large sums of VC money/expertise. If anyone is going to execute well, its going to be coinbase.

This guy gets it. A portfolio of currencies will achieve mainstream usage, with tailored parameters giving them different characteristics. One coin to rule them all is foolish. 
Cave men probably thought silver, gold and platinum were all pretty much the same: shiny, noble and soft. Its the nuances which distinguish them and dictate their value.
