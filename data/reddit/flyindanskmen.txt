This is the truth. Especially watching it crash hard how it seems to do every couple of years.

Bitcoin gives you the fever. Buy in small amounts over a long period and ride the general upward wave.

I predict 3700 will be the floor.

I'm putting like $25 in a month. If it goes big, I'll ride the wave. If it tanks it was fun. 
Digital currency can give you "the fever" fast. Don't let it.

I can't imagine buying and saying I'm going to sell less than 5 years. I bought $25 at 4600, I'm chill. Going to buy $25 a month for a while. No panic. Dips just mean my next buy lowers my cost average.

I like how they used the word stole.  Seized assets from a site used for drug trafficking isn't exactly stolen.
Also how do you prevent government employees from stealing all the bitcoins anyways? It's untraceable right? Maybe i'm a little ignorant, but I don't think any government can reasonably hold them as assets, if it wanted to.

Money "earned" outside the law was never earned. We could argue till we are blue in the face that the government is an institution of the people or a separate entity in enemy of the people. But there is no reason it should tax people more, or run the debt up more than just liquidate assets in this fashion to pay its bills.
