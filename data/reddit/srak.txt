@_date: 2017-03-17 14:01:45
No, you make people WANT to upgrade. 
I agree that some previous hard-forks happened in somewhat different circumstances but wouldn't you agree to at least consider it an option. There is risk with all options. The not doing anything is an option that will lead to the downfall of bitcoin. Now people here are talking about UASF, is that a no risk option to you ?
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:43:31
Thanks,   
I read quickly(at work) through the second link. ( I'll read the first later but it seems less unbiased as a source.) It says based on 2014/5 data we shouldn't do more than 4Mb block or the slowest 10% nodes might start to struggle.
So no reason to not already have 2mb at all ?
@_date: 2017-03-20 18:17:28
I see lightning more as channels between big players (exchanges, casinos, ...)that constantly send coin back and forth. they can settle at the end of the day. Not that useful for individual end users.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:56:26
No, that's the core(hah!) of the issue. They have said that but the opponents don't believe them. If they truly do they should release it (a first on-chain blocksize increase) already, bundle it with segwit and let people/miners vote on that.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:10:03
You appear not to have actually read my comments yet do call me names.  
That's a pitty, I wish you a good day nevertheless.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:48:41
So you agree segwit is not a scaling solution.  
People want scaling (core &amp; BU alike to simplify)  
=&gt; implement the first ACTUAL step to (on-chain) scaling and bundle it with segwit. Everyone wins.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:58:12
Step one, reopen the dialog.  
judging by my inbox, step one needs lots of work.
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:28:03
Now, at least you made me laugh, thanks !
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:29:09
yes, the 2 mb is always meant to be part of a scaling roadmap. e.g. [BIP101](
@_date: 2017-03-17 22:40:10
I could argue semantics but in general I agree with you on the long term. We're not there yet though by a long shot. Meanwhile we need user level accessible straightforward capacity increase, no settlement layer for a couple exchanges
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:16:02


What does this mean ? forcing people to upgrade ?


because Hard forks have happened before in bitcoin and happen all the time in other coins
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:11:44
It has been the narrative in this sub for a long time. Core proposed it at the bitcoin [SCALING convention](  
I still remember the back and forths coming from 20mb blocks to ending on 2mb+segwit which was ultimately rejected
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:33:51
You prove 2mb blocks will make bitcoin explode on the spot.
I'm fully aware that on-chain scaling has its limits and side-chains or similar alternatives will add value, but if you want to continue to onboard bitcoin users now we need on-chain scaling now.
@_date: 2017-03-17 13:18:00
@_date: 2017-03-12 16:07:08
short term, try viabtc's accelerator.
Long term, show support for block size scaling efforts.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:29:07
it has a one time "bonus" of adding extra space for transactions but provides no option for future increases if needed. Just even look at [this]( and this increase is only listed way down below.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:51:13
Sigh..., come on, you can do better than this ... not sure what "this" even is.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:21:10
yup, this is what started it all. had there been a 2mb increase last year we would have had segwit in the following months. Now I doubt that would be enough.
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:55:19
"Who wants that!!!!!!!?"  
I do? Bitcoin is suppose to be a lay man's alternative.
Guess what, I even support the EU :) , not sure about the link here though.
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:16:48


Reread my comments, it's not about segwit. You don't have to agree with the other side to at least try to understand their viewpoint.


I'm waiting here right alongside you.


Again, it's statement, not a goal an sich; if you'd try to see their viewpoint you might be more open to a way out of this " We vs them" stalemate.


We at least got this in common, it's a start :)
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:09:34
Big blockers originally weren't opposed to segwit per se originally. They only started to oppose it when Core wouldn't even consider any scaling option by saying that segwit was the scaling solution, period, which it clearly is not.  
While opposition has grown beyond that ( too complicated, unfair discount, etc) I'm sure that if Core would have agreed to a conservative on chain scaling roadmap with a 2mb blocksize increase to start, bundled with Segwit, it would have been adopted without much hassle and we would never have been in this mess.  
Core's unwillingness to compromise just a tiny bit when the other side came down substantially exploded in their face when they now need the others to activate segwit and they say "lol, nope"  
Combine it with the outright rude attitudes shown by (some of) Core/Blockstream/small-blockers and things like the creative housekeeping in this sub and the other camp just digs in deeper and more people are flocking to their camp everyday.
@_date: 2017-03-17 14:26:22
Yes,   
that's my premise from the start here, no? Big-blockers do not believe Core will ever deliver on-chain scaling voluntarily, so they hold onto segwit as their bargaining chip. Core says, segwit is enough for now and "will look at true scaling after"; hence the full stalemate we're in now.
The longer this lasts the deeper both camps dig in and tear wounds to the other side that get harder and harder to heal. So we need a compromise option  both camps can live with before it's too late.
@_date: 2017-03-17 12:37:38
Hard forks dohave a risk, hence you agree with all involved upfront on a small clear change. If everyone is on board, the risk is mitigated. The potential odd one out still not playing ball is no risk


you're doing it again

@_date: 2016-02-15 15:49:14
From what I can tell, you have it the wrong way around. XT, unlimited, classic clients were created because Core Devs refused to even consider raising the blocklimit. All their proposals were outright rejected so they resorted to release alt-clients. Classic is Core 11 with just that 1 change.   
Like you say "people want bigger block yes". What you and op propose was what was asked for over and over but rejected by what those people see as a handful devs with ulterior motives blocking bigger block, so they had to resort to their only option, releasing an alternative client.
@_date: 2016-02-09 20:41:33

Quick Question.  
is this also the reason tips &amp; buying don't work anymore? I just says "sold out" on the black coins and when clicking "buy 500 BTC" it says please connect to the internet..." but my connectivity is fine.
@_date: 2015-03-20 12:48:21
Yes, also the "please connect..." is at all times ( wifi &amp; 3G) and is on the ipad as well. Date &amp; time is set to automatic on both.  
I'd be happy to send info/logs if you're interested.

@_date: 2013-06-11 15:58:21
I'm trying to validate if my above assumptions are correct.
There's also a client in Beta which additional features called Coin Control. I guess this could be used for this.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:54:08
Damn, I should have thought of that !  
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:43:16
ok, that makes sense. but what's the point of sending people these mini amounts if they are never able to send them further, hmmm...
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:52:15
Thanks, a good start, but it doesn't address what people recieving tips need to do ( those that haven't got a bitcoin address)
@_date: 2013-06-11 21:02:05
Thanks.  
why 100 days though. the amount and transaction size would be ok, so priority would be the deciding factor
priority = sum(input_value_in_base_units * input_age)/size_in_byte.
input_age is the number confirmations, is there a fixed number by day ? what actually drives this ?
@_date: 2013-08-01 16:47:42
Cool, thanks !
*now if only I could find a thousand others willing to do the same my problem would be solved ...*
@_date: 2013-06-08 17:34:39
Well, that's mostly what I have, lots of dust. How exactly does it cause problems?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:52:57
hah, don't know, I may have missed a 0...
@_date: 2013-06-11 15:48:03
hah, no I don't even have 1 BTC.
But I read that the minimum total amount of a transaction for it to not require fees is 0.01. But if I send e.g 0.01 + 0.001 +0.001 in one transaction to a new adress, do I get 1 input of 0.1002 or still three seperate values ?
I did check the unspent with .bitcoind -listunpent. is that inputs or outputs ?
@_date: 2013-04-12 14:21:04
I'll send everything I got right back ;)
@_date: 2013-06-11 17:45:31
I see what you mean, you send the sum amount through again from the receiving address making the first a prerequisite. Can you do that (send again)even if it has zero confirmations?
@_date: 2013-06-11 15:39:05
Gotcha on the keys vs coins.
The point would be to make transactions that don't need a fee by using 1 input that has a large enough priority so that a small additional in the same transaction would still not require a fee. Yes you send them to a new address (in the same wallet)
Assuming this is possible, as you just said it is good for bitcoin, so why isn't this an option in wallets to consolidate inputs ?
@_date: 2013-06-11 17:30:58
Interesting, wat impact does sending it twice have on whether miners will confirm the transaction?
And if this is the case what's stopping everyone from doing this all the time, circumventing fees altogether...
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:41:20
yeah, agreed. But it didn't give a warning about it, it just deleted it. Mind you this is a company provided install, but still pretty aggressive.
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:11:58
ok, that was a real eye opener for me; I thought fees were just added manually and voluntary as incentive...guess not.
@_date: 2013-09-08 18:40:42

So how/why do those faucets give you B 0.000001 than ? I got quite a few of those, Does this mean they had to Pay 0.0005 in transactions fees for each one they sent me and I would have to pay the same for spending them ?
@_date: 2013-09-25 17:12:45
  aaand..they're down !
@_date: 2013-09-08 21:48:46
I wouldn't call it a faucet. It's one of those Crowdsourcing Services like amazon turk called CrowdFlower that handle the tasks and then you have multiple partners where to do tasks and earn rewards of which bitcoinget is one.
@_date: 2013-11-25 14:31:44
I'm more of a lurker and definately a Bitcoin noob despite looking from the sidelines for quite a while (yes kicking myself for not taking a plunge months ago).
  
My question though is how to get bitcoins in the first place, I mean just a small amount to use for things like this,etc ? I'm quite reluctant to go and meet someone on localbitcoins for 10€, any other way that don't involve a big hassle ?
@_date: 2013-06-12 11:23:03
I found that confirmations is in how many blocks it's included where the expected rate is 144 per day.  
so 13017/144 = 90 days
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:39:06
haha. I just clicked again. their was an ad labeled "garlic" I clicked it and it was just a picture of.... yeah garlic.  
Probably a test, still found it amusing.
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:38:05
Do you mean that the fees are always going to be per little piece I have, even If I would use them all in 1 big(well relatively) payment of say 0.1B. So that would be fee x 100000 ( if all I had received was 000001's), not even 1 time high fee of e.g. 0.02 to send that 0.1 because it's a complex transaction ?
wouldn't my fee be higher then the actual amount in the first case ?
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:23:51
is that different from creating a new address in my wallet and sending everything to that new address ? or isn't that possible.
and would it then be combined in 1 amount or still be lots of dust...
@_date: 2013-08-01 17:40:50
ah that's more like iike it ! big thanks !
@_date: 2013-06-12 06:46:11
I think that's a bit simplistic. It's indeed amount x age that's the driving factor, but age is number of confirmations.
you need to be above ~57 milion to not be low pty.
so 01000000 * age / 226 = 57600000  
age = 57600000 /1000000 * 226  
age = 13 017 confirmations.
not a clue how many confirmation you get per day or what drives the rate but. it seems to be around 5000 a month for the small pieces I have.  
 So in conclusion, probably a bit less then 100 days, but you're not too far off.
@_date: 2013-08-01 17:18:17
I realise I'm probably never going to make money of it, I just think it would be nice to have one. Since people were buying them in such abundant numbers I'd assume it's be straightforward to find one, apparently not so...
@_date: 2013-09-12 13:05:10
This concerns the cpu miner. I had it running on my laptop and AV deleted it today...
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:18:17
How does a miner do that though? adding transactions or not I mean. e.g. someone with an ASIC thing plugged into his USB isn't watching a screen with transactions scrolling and saying Yes or no to accept certain transactions...?
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:09:50
Pardon my ignorance, but where else would you keep it. Isn't it like a current account so you need it online to receive and send coins from it. I get that you may store you "savings account' on a backup disk. but for the other one, isn't encrypting it enough ?
note that this is a hypothetical quistion as I don't have any coins :)
@_date: 2013-06-08 17:41:30
ah, thanks for that...*starts reading*
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:15:51
I understand the reason for fees, but like I mentioned I never saw an option in my miner to accept or reject transactions based on fees. Pickupjojo's link implies it's enforced by the bitcoin protocol, do you mean miners have a say in it ?
@_date: 2013-06-08 18:27:44
Thanks, but I've long given up mining. 
That said, if it's an option to the miners, it means someone out there has to be a GGG and accept all those microtransactions that didn't include a fee. Though It seems the client will enforce a fee based on certain conditions.

Yes, I read about fees when I dabbled in mining but I'm unsure what they do in practice. I understand they serve as an incentive to miners to verify transactions faster as they then get these fees. Now in practice You just run your miner and any transaction fees are a bonus. I didn't see any interactive way of choosing to verify transactions or not, so wouldn't just any transactions be picked up by miners regardless ? I'm sure I'm missing some point here...
@_date: 2013-12-06 18:17:35
there's a custom addition to the bitcoin-qt client called coin control which does all you want. it's not part of the official client though.
[Coin Control](
Clicking inputs open a selectable list of all inputs in your wallet and the custom change adress is right there.
@_date: 2013-08-01 17:37:48
Thanks for the suggestion. Unfortunately most only ship to the US or demand shipping costs of almost as much as the unit.
@_date: 2013-06-11 18:13:24
But if pty=sum(inputs*age)/size and age is number of confirmations, since nobody will confirm the first transaction, the pty to send the second transaction will be effectively 0. Thus sending it without fee risks then again not have this one confirmed....
@_date: 2013-06-11 18:38:14
Thanks, yes that was what I was hoping to do. There's a thing called coin control which is apparently a bit more user friendly
