It means people are leaving alts and leaving Btc to fiat I don’t know if this is something to cheer on lol

I agree with the article i don’t think old money wants us to win but at this point they have no choice after a few bears we’re FUD proof now ��

I think it’s more so Upbit and investors moving their money out but I’m sure they’ll move it somewhere else to start trading again. Once you’re in crypto you’re in it for life.

Just another day in crypto

Dominance is high because people are most likely exiting alts into Btc and into fiat.

If it’s not taxed or accepted by the governments it won’t happen. It started with us true but if both sides don’t work together it’s going to be a bumpy road

Without adoption our market wouldn’t be shit right now it’s a double edge sword

USD is losing its value everyday funny how the media never talks about that lol but trust me we all it to work but i think we’ll need certain powers to be to help take us to that next level but you can sense the bitterness in Wall Street because this was mainstreets thing to begin with 
@_date: 2018-03-14 19:51:03
Every ad on google or Facebook or Instagram we’re scam shitcoin anyways lol anyone in crypto knew better it’s just the new investors that didn’t so good riddance

More exposure to btc is a bad thing? An easier way for other people who are interested in investing is a dumb thing? Lol  someone who wants to invest a large amount isn’t going to sign up to Binance and buy it themselves we have all these fairy tale OTC deals in which 95% have either a fake seller or a fake buyer who expects real firms and people just to give up their info with zero proof of coins or funds an easy way to get BTC and that’s bad? Lol I understand the whole we got to beat the banks and control our own money mindset but how in the hell are we going to move pass to the next phase without more people and more influence.

Didn’t ETF’s boost the price of gold when it was introduced in 2003? 
@_date: 2018-07-21 02:32:44
Whoops posted the wrong article i had saw it on Apple news for CNBC lol guess they’ve talking about this for the last 5 years then my bad lol 
@_date: 2018-07-21 04:40:44
Wouldn’t that add on to it’s legitimacy to the masses tho? 
@_date: 2018-07-20 20:21:37
It’s basically saying gold is dying and invest in Pokémon cards.

It’s not that easy to find sellers at this price for bulk btc even with btc farms (miners) it’s a process but not everyone is willing to sell at a discounted rate for bulk buyers 
@_date: 2018-04-05 21:29:17
The atmosphere of Reddit was so different then lol Sataoshi lives on tho ����
@_date: 2018-04-09 01:02:23

@_date: 2018-04-12 16:35:17
What a bunch of losers
@_date: 2018-04-09 00:06:36
I’m talking about sellers to sell in bulk for OTC all that is off market at a certain price fix, I’m just going by some that I tried setting up try to go out and see if someone will try to sell you 50k btc at a -6% rate and see if you can find someone that sells if you do let me know lol

Sadly we kind of see that in our space now the further we go up the more greedy some people get. Positive thing tho their still our good people leading in this space and I think there will still be once the institution money arrives

Everybody sells something to some degree unless they already have capital to spend on other ventures. I believe in HODL but i also believe in taking some profit for investing in something elsewhere or have some funds for rainy days like these past two months
