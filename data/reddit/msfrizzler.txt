80% of people facing mental health problems live in developing countries, where fewer than 1 in 5 get any treatment. BasicNeeds works with communities and Departments of Health in Africa and Asia to improve treatment options and challenge the stigma of mental health.

Agree! Your money could go a long way for these kids.

Seriously, GiveDirectly is a no-brainer. It puts $$ straight into the pockets of those who need it most and they've done tons of research on their impact. (spoiler alert: poor people use money to start businesses or educate their kids, not get drunk)
100% recommend.

Not all effective altruists have the same goal... Some want to reduce suffering among people and animals, some want to make people happier, some want to safeguard the future by dealing with threats from nuclear weapons, manmade viruses, and AI.
The thing they all have in common is a commitment to using reason and scientific evidence to achieve their aims in the most effective way possible.

This post made my day. Very cool!
I'd encourage you to consider the Against Malaria Foundation. It horrifies me to realize there are parents who can't afford a $4 bednet to protect their children from a life-threatening disease. I can't imagine having a child and not being able to keep him or her safe.
Malaria still kills nearly a million children every year, but it is VERY preventable. The Gateses are also working on eradicating malaria because it's such an effective way of improving lives for those worst off. And a lot of governments have partnered with AMF, so your dollars will go twice as far!
According to GiveWell charity evaluators, you can save a life for $3500 with bednets. They also say that the Against Malaria Foundation will fall $50 million short of their funding target just this year. If you made up that gap, you would singlehandedly save the lives of more than 14,000 people - and you'd have 14,000 very grateful families thanking you.
