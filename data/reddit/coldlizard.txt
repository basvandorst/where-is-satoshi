this is pretty interesting, because if it caught on then Twitter could end up *being* an equivalent to bitcoin. i.e. all the payments are there publicly distributed in the twitter log for verification, so in a sense Twitter would become the trusted third party. I guess the twitter-coin system could still use the bitcoin network in the background to verify all the payments properly to avoid the risk of Twitter going amok.

How about this: create an advertising bot using Bitcointip - you send it a link with an X bitcoin tip and price per recipient, and it tips anyone who tweets the link, proportional to their numbers of followers. Interesting thing about this is that people will get tipped for posting a link regardless of whether they knew they were going to or not.

thanks that's useful. To be honest it looks like the main reasons are as a political statement - i.e. the main reason to use Bitcoin right now is to express your views that it would be nice if *everyone* used this system. I can't really see what the personal reasons are in the shorter term. e.g. my bank seems pretty secure, isn't likely to freeze my account unless they have a good reason, there isn't much corruption in e.g. UK police and law enforcement etc. Plus there are a lot of reasons not to use it, e.g. that hardly anyone seems to accept it for payments.
Of course if governments in the UK messed up majorly in the future then all this might change and something like Bitcoin might be useful.
So am I right in thinking that using Bitcoin at the moment is basically a case of promoting a political ideal rather than having any direct short-term value?

I like the global aspect. e.g. Barclays Ping-it is doing a nice job of things like TX fees for mobile transfers in the UK, but sending money abroad is still a pain

I think Ping-it is a pretty bad thing for Bitcoin, because I think it would have been better if Bitcoin had got there first and instead become the next hype for small payments.
