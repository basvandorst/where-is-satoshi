That's wrong. If a government group got enough asics to beat over 50% of the processing power and match growth, they could erase the entire history of transferred bitcoins back to the beginning.

Sky's the limit, have as many pools as you want.

One whale can trigger a significant price drop after other holders dump their coins too - these 1% guys are more like lochness monsters should they decide to sell.
The risk of a serious crash of the value of the bitcoin is increased when there are so many whales and 1%ers with an extreme amount of coins.

Sure, but usually people don't empty out other people's bank accounts. The common thief doesn't make this much money per theft. People are worried about the gox coins being split up so many times, as they appear to be getting ready to eventually potentially stealthily sell on the markets - that is extreme negative pressure on the current value of your coins, not only from lack of buy support but lack of people in crypto. 
A ton of coins that were going to be held by people with high hopes in BTC have now been taken by someone who doesn't care about bitcoin's value, besides what he can sell his stash for.
That website who has stolen 15,000 ltc so far? That's over $220k at $15 each. Welcome to crypto grandma! Oh.. Your money is gone.. People who expressed the initiative to get into cryptocurrencies have now possibly lost their money and may not be returning.

Bitcoin has too much trust needed for these big players. Two colluding pools with even only 30% of the hashing power can easily bring it down. 
Ghash.io actually had more than 50% at times. "They hit a four block streak, missed one, then nailed eight in a row, then grabbed another seven streak and nobody seemed to care because the pie chart was still at 47% or whatever."
Those with less than half of the hashing power have higher chances of a successful attack than most people knew of earlier. I feel ASICS helped reach this point, where millionaires can easily buy a machine with an extreme hash rate, outmining the rest of us in not only hash rate, but profitability.

Yes, we have 'socialized' losses, but that is because such a loss would be devastating to the individual. Many ways could get your card stolen, and why should you lose so much because of a thief? 
Just because your bitcoins got stolen doesn't mean you were not being reasonably responsible. A 100% offline wallet is the most responsible but a Windows computer connected to the Internet is quite the hazard. Most people have such a setup. 
That's being irresponsible with your bitcoins as most know windows is a popular malware target.

So how about we treat those who manipulate the way they should be treated, and take our business elsewhere?
Just because it happens, doesn't mean you have to sit there and take it.
If there are no consequences for faking ticker prices, then people will more likely do it. If there are consequences, the chances are much lower of it happening. Why would OKCoin continue to fake data if everyone is going to leave them? They wouldn't!
You're right, manipulating prices up is only temporary. Doesn't mean it still isn't taking money from other people. Perhaps that is because OKCoin raised the price above where it would be in the natural market, then dumped their coins, lowering the price back down.
Morals exists in capitalism as a reason not to buy from a certain business. Just because it was bound to happen from such a lawless currency doesn't mean there shouldn't be any consequences. Part of the reason to use a trusted exchange is so that they won't run away with your money. The people behind OKCoin clearly don't have character to falsify prices. I can't trust them with much.
Give your money to legitimate businesses. Personally, I will never use OKCoin.

You would think if petrodollar is as huge as people say it is, then you would claim the price of oil halving has significantly lowered the demand for dollars.

He was acting as an unlicensed money transmitter business, which are regulated in the USA. Why should he be allowed to break the rules when no one else is? Processing over a million dollars is different than selling $500 in bitcoins on LocalBitcoins.
If you sell bitcoins on LocalBitcoins, and the buyer specifically tells you that he is going to do illegal activities with his bitcoins, you are not allowed to sell him the bitcoins. Anyone can reasonably assume the $1 million he allowed to go to the Silk Road likely helped illegal activity.
This isn't his first offense, and he had multiple chances to stop, including when the Silk Road was first shut down.

You claim petrodollar is important to the USA.
All of the sudden, the price of oil more than halved sharply, literally halving the amount of foreign currencies being converted into dollars for the purposes of oil purchasing.
Instead of the gloom and doom petrodollar theorists claimed would happen if the amount of foreign currencies being exchanged into USD dropped, the dollar actually gained strength.
Why is the result the exact opposite of what people are claiming?

I feel the same, just substituting "Eastern Europe" for "china".

When dollars inflate people here call it theft, but apparently bitcoins deflating isn't any transfer of wealth. 
Unfortunately, bitcoin is hilariously unequal. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 11:40:34
Bitrefill has a huge markup, unfortunately 
@_date: 2015-02-16 21:31:40
Yep. 
You could send dollars without the 4.6% trust fee from PayPal. Even if a bitcoin PayPal was established. there would still be fees.
@_date: 2015-02-15 04:00:18
Yeah seriously. 
If malware liked this attacked bitcoin users, all of the money would be 100% gone. Thank god people stored their money in dollars in a bank so it's FDIC-insured. 
Like that guy who lost $40k, he's just fucked out of his money. 
Edit: can't downvote facts away nice try. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 13:59:13
People here seem to think people mining to fuck with bitcoin are going to buy the ultra expensive super electricity-efficient miners. 
Hell no. We're going to get a lot of powerful yet inefficient ASICs because the power costs do no matter in the short term. 
@_date: 2015-02-04 14:03:40
Your coins will have a significant drop in value, even if you yourself won't lose them, because of lost trust in digital currencies of other people when the encryption gets broken. 
@_date: 2015-02-24 20:56:36
They have tens of thousands of bitcoins they will likely be required by law to liquidate to pay back their debts.
So here comes a temporary price dip.
Edit: Can't downvote facts away @_date: 2015-02-10 23:42:29
We're at least aware of honest attempts 
@_date: 2015-02-10 23:41:48
A world where you have millions of dollars for the budget to attack bitcoin. 
No need to spend $10,000 on a 1 liter engine making 200 HP. Just build a huge, power inefficient 6 liter engine making 200 hp for $1000.

not while it's volatile  and uninsured. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 15:04:40
Miners need to break even, and they want profits. 
Millions of dollars worth of BTC are printed every day, no? Transaction fees have been under $4000, for everyone.
Its going to be a rough and expensive transition. 
@_date: 2015-03-08 14:59:25
Stay relevant?
Swift handles 11,500 transactions per second. It could do more, but this is about average. 
Bitcoin can handle 7 transactions per second. 
Bitcoin's slow speed makes it completely irrelevant for any scaled-up transaction speed requirements.

Just a few points to get the reddit circlejerk about localbitcoins being awesome, then it will repeat itself and we're in business! 
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:29:50
If they were abandoning wealth, why would they sell their coins? Buying pressure into bitcoins raises the price of bitcoins, and thus the wealth of bitcoin holders. It's not a flat exchange, else BTC wouldn't be so volatile. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:15:52
Absolutely not. 
They were a bitcoin exchange, but they had nothing to do with bitcoin. Understand? 
@_date: 2015-02-15 04:01:59
A coordinated attack like this on a bitcoin exchange would surely take it down and tank the price. 
This just shows the strength of FDIC-insured deposits. Safely store your money in a US Bank or be shit out if luck when the next bitcoin exchange crashes. 
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:23:40
Let's use bitcoin to get away from fees! 
Now opening, bitrated! Only a 2% fee, plus whatever it takes to change your dollars into BTC!

Yup, and SHA was developed by cryptography experts at the NSA. 


SHA WAS created by the NSA. Downvotes won't change facts, Redditors.
@_date: 2015-02-10 14:21:11
What do you mean? Everyone can join bitcoin and funnel wealth to existing owners? 
@_date: 2015-02-06 01:51:02
Why use bitcoin then? There would be huge internal costs of shifting bitcoin around. That is why coinbase, for example, does its transactions off-chain, unless it is going somewhere else. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 06:10:26
Are you joking me? I read the bitcoin wiki, I'm an economics expert.

Lol I'm sorry the hitman was an undercover cop and not an actual hitman. Looks like the willing and knowing payment infrastructure was there, along with customers seeking an actual hitman. 
Should we wait until someone is killed before doing anything? Will that make you happy? Or is someone actually paying someone else to kill another person not good enough for you? 
@_date: 2015-03-29 02:18:22
Not if you seal yourself and your bitcoin in a cold underground storage room without any Internet access and sit there on your offline laptop with three-way signature confirmation between you, a piece of paper in your wallet, and a note in a bank vault. 
Then it is 100% secure, and also 100% unusable. 
@_date: 2015-02-06 01:48:06
And bitcoin wasn't even invaded by Russia
@_date: 2015-02-12 05:04:59
Yep. They're all going to dump their BTC the instant they get it for dollars.

I mean, I know what he said, but I believe killerstorms intended meaning was different. He may want to know why Uy9 feels bitcoin isn't worth picking up if it had had inflation.

Riiume wants you to use bitcoin's public ledger so he can track your personal purchases.

The answer "no", or "I'm not sure" is implied. 
Let me restate my comment to you. 
"I'm not sure, but why does it matter if it was successful? He tried."

Google bitcoin and shady places that appear legit pop-up everywhere. Seriously, they look legit.  There's no way for these unconnected people to know about the big fish..

* Individuals can trade bitcoins, but no new business or services should be created related to bitcoins for now
* Existing business should immediately take measures to comply with existing money laundering regulations
Money laundering regulations? In bitcoins? I would assume they would raid after the exchange can't comply, because they cannot, and should move their bitcoins out of China ASAP.
