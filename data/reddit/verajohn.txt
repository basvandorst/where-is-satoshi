Nevermind, I assume you can get all transaction data from the backend. Seems like an awesome thing.

You probably know already that the bitcoin "crashes" caused by MtGox are not a problem with Bitcoin itself. The sooner people stop using MtGox, the better for Bitcoin and for us. We need people to stop using MtGox in order to be able to focus on the development of Bitcoin. Specifically, we need to stop new bitcoin users to get goxed because they read about bitcoin and see MtGox being mentioned as the biggest Bitcoin exchange in old articles.
I propose the following actions in order to accomplish this and by doing so, helping Bitcoin in the long term.
*Email websites that still mentions MtGox as a working exchange. They should be told that MtGox no longer works and that thousands of people are out their money that is locked in their MtGox accounts.
*New bitcoin users might read about MtGox in old news articles, google "mtgox" and end up creating an account there. I have created the site mtgoxsucks.org and am trying to make it appear in the search results next to mtgox so that at least new users get a chance to read about the problems before they lose their money.
*I would like to get funding to advertise mtgoxsucks.org with Google AdWords. This should be a cheap way to reach lots of new bitcoiners before they get goxed.
*In order to make mtgoxsucks.org rank better in Google, I need people to link to it from their sites, blogs or forum posts. I'm making more tools for this available soon.
Thanks for reading and please let me know your thoughts about this.

No possibility to view transactions in json format like on blockchain by adding ?format=json to the end of any page?

Yes, but it may help users to get som funds back if they don't want to take the risk of waiting.
