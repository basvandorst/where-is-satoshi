Yes I used the lost password method. I first tried it with my username but I never received the reset email. After half an hour of waiting I was really worried that my account had been compromised. So then I used the lost password method again with my email address and it worked! Funny thing is that I didn't have to wait an extra 24 hours. I am quite convinced that my account had never been compromised as no harm had been done.

The same thing happened to me except that I was awake at the time and I dealt with it immediately. Like you, I am also very careful and so could eliminate most of the obvious reasons.
As I just wrote in  I suspect that someone did a mass password reset attack on Mt.Gox with a bunch of email addresses that they had harvested. It is shocking that Mt.Gox allows the password reset procedure to be triggered with just an email address.

As I wrote 8 hours ago, it had nothing to so with usernames, it was a mass attack using email addresses which are easy to come by given the huge amount of spam we all receive.

This also happened to me 27 hours ago. 
Immediately upon receipt of the password reset email, I requested Mt.Gox support to block all withdrawals. They responded after one hour that they had done so. Apart from that, they weren't very helpful.
I've had a stressful 20 hours or so until I was alerted to this thread and until I was able to reset my password after the 24 hours had elapsed.
I just discovered that anyone can trigger the password reset email by simply entering your email address! So I suspect that someone did a mass password reset with a bunch of email addresses that they had harvested. It was smart of them to do it on a weekend when Mt.Gox customer support is understaffed.
This is a security vulnerability that Mt.Gox should address.
All my funds are safe. Now I just need to persuade Mt.Gox to allow me to withdraw again!

You're welcome. I was pretty stressed over this as well and I am glad that you posted about it first.
