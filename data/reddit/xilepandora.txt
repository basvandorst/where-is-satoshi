I live in Canada, Coinsquare is great and works fast albeit the 3 day withholding time until I’m allowed to withdraw BTC or fiat is annoying, but they have a physical office at least.
Might be biased here but I’ve met some of their staff IRL at events and they seem as legit as any.

“For a whole day I kept telling people the clock will strike midnight and no one believed me”
You had a decent brag going up till you claimed it’s going to go completely bust. News flash markets have cycles and this one isn’t different.

I’m sorry did I specify any particular token was going to cycle? What about all the stocks that died as well? Please try and understand the main idea my man.

My man what does “all cycles” even mean. I’m taking about markets here, they don’t reference singular tokens in crypto.
And markets do have time up and time down, that’s the point of cycles.

Thank you for this correction, I only hope people can find this video after watching Ellen's  lol.
I appreciated Ellen for bringing Bitcoin to millions of her audience. Needless to say I was disappointed she started off mentioning that Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency then followed with "I don't know what that means." I understand her need to appeal to a broad audience but at least get a semi knowledgeable person to take over. I can only hope new people will gauge an interest in Bitcoin and do proper research and not think of it as goats lol.

One thing people fail to realize is that Warren buffet WAS right, he’s an experienced investor and recognized an obvious bubble built of irrational interest on greed. However he put out a disclaimer right after saying he doesn’t talk about things he doesn’t understand, but he DOES understand bubbles and he was on the money. I don’t understand why people hate on him without doing their research, this by far isn’t the first or last bubble Bitcoin will have and obviously it’s not going to be the last time Bitcoin “dies.”
