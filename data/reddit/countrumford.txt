I guess this means technology alone isn't going to safeguard the system. As with the quality of most other goods, we have to rely on the collective self-interest of market participants to regulate things. It doesn't mean there won't be bumps in the road but I don't think that's grounds for panic.

Sure, but I'm wondering if a p2pool over 50% would be less of a threat than a GHash doing the same thing. Wouldn't you have to 51% attack p2pool itself first in order to do the same to bitcoin?

It's also very expensive paying 50% of what you produce in taxes and fees throughout your life to a monopoly that really does a terrible job at resolving conflicts.
This is a lack of imagination I am unaccustomed to seeing in a subreddit devoted to a technology designed to upend numerous entrenched state monopolies. You have my pity.

You're not wrong, but it isn't the job of bitcoin to perform "consumer protection" jobs the same way it isn't the US Dollar's job to do it for Visa and Mastercard. Dollars are just dollars, and bitcoins are just bitcoins. Things like consumer protection and customer service have to come from those building businesses around bitcoin.
Bitcoin was invented out of a desire to replicate some of those financial services in a trustless way. The way I read the whitepaper, being competitive in *performance* to those services wasn't a primary goal. Overcoming the need to trust them was. The features that require trust will need to be invented and provided by sources outside of bitcoin itself.

Until the concept of a PoW-validated blockchain, there wasn't a way to solve the Byzantine Generals' problem. Granted that's only a problem if you think there are untrustworthy generals. Some people are okay with totally trusting governments and banks to run the monetary system.
Others are not. For them, bitcoin is useful and unique.

In what sense is collusion possible on p2pools that wouldn't be possible no matter what mining scheme is used?
@_date: 2014-05-16 21:49:56
Probably because to do it you need to operate a registered business, and in the case of BitInstant it was an easy target for the feds. BitInstant was taken down for not jumping through the "money transmitter" regulatory hoops. Allegations of money laundering were easy because of Silk Road's fame and that the business dealt in cash transfers.
It might be a while before someone simultaneously has the balls to risk painting that target on their back, and the capital to become an above-board "money transmitter".

Most of the readouts should be obvious. The "Best Block Age" flashes to bright violet whenever a new latest block is discovered, and slowly fades through the spectrum to dark red over the next ten minutes. If a new block takes more than 11 minutes it fades to black. It gives a nice quick glance at how long the block height has been what it is -- at least according to the node.

A disagreement like this can either be resolved peaceably by one side changing how they act, or by choosing to walk away from the relationship. "Because free market" actually works here because she isn't the boss's slave. Going to the government agency makes it an unfriendly confrontation right from the start, which might prevent both of them from getting what they want. But since every other option except leaving is either illegal or suppressed by the presence of the state, I'm not going to condemn someone for going to the only agency allowed to defend them.
I'd love it if there were a free economy of mediators, arbitrators, and insurers that can help people of all walks of life solve labor problems constructively, but we don't live in that world yet.

I used to trade a bit when I got into bitcoin last year. Sometimes gained, sometimes lost. I finally realized I wasn't good enough at trading to make all the stress worthwhile. Since I believe this technology is going to go places in the long run, I just buy and hold, or if I want to buy something using BTC, I buy slightly more than I need and save the rest.
100BTC goal? I'd be thrilled to have 10.

When I started into bitcoin I was using MoneyGram orders with bitInstant or waiting close to 2 weeks to get funds into Dwolla and then Gox. And there weren't many avenues to spend it. Now I'm making instant purchases on Coinbase, and I can use it to buy practically anything.
The ecosystem really is getting better very quickly. It seems slow because I wish it was faster, but the reality is the technology and the tools around it are maturing at a breakneck pace.

That's an excellent question. In my opinion the benefit is bitcoin's monetary policy. Bitcoin behaves like a hard currency as opposed to a "floating" one. The Austrian and Chicago schools of economics say there are great benefits to that. Others with different ideological views will say that's no benefit at all, but I don't think they properly understand how the money creation regime affects everything else about our lives, or they idolize government so much they want the omnipotent one that fiat currency enables.


People trying to trade freely across distances and borders can do so even when oppressive regimes might want to stand between them. When certain trades are prohibited by states, the black markets in those trades that emerge have historically been very dangerous because they have really terrible mechanisms for information coordination. The combination of bitcoin and a TOR hidden site like SilkRoad made the procurement of otherwise prohibited substances much safer for the consumer. Think what you want about whether people should be allowed to do those things, at least they weren't risking life and limb as much while doing it.
The problem bitcoin tries to solve is the need to trust a central authority on what is or isn't a valid transaction. Centralized structures are vulnerable to compromise by the state. If you don't view that, or how the state runs the economy as a problem, then bitcoin will look like it serves no purpose. If you believe government and its partners in financial services are generally good, you will see bitcoin as evil, like Paul Krugman does.

It will still be the most popular use of the currency. BitCoin is just as arbitrary as US Dollars. The only benefits are built-in deflation and absolute privacy. Commodities are a better inflation hedge than BitCoins, so I think the greatest marginal utility of the currency is its ability to circumvent attempts at monitoring. It will flourish where privacy is at a premium. The likeliest early uses for it once it expands beyond tech enthusiasts will be to buy/sell things surreptitiously.

"Complaining visibly" is just so much foot-stomping and pouting.
What really grabs a company's attention is taking your money elsewhere.
I work for a quickly growing online retailer and did a few months in the customer service team. You know what gets old fast? Idiot customers bitching on Facebook that we "stole their money" when the Facebook post is the first we ever heard of their problem. In the end, all that really happened is that they botched their delivery address, didn't wait long enough, or added extra hassle by trying to cancel via chargeback minutes after ordering.

Nomenclature aside, integrating into already-existing financial tools is also important, and micro-bitcoins would.
Most financial software is designed to handle only two decimal places. Some programming languages even have "money" data types designed like that. Why? Because floating point math on a computer isn't precise in the way that financial calculations need to be precise. Sometimes they even multiply by 100 first, do the math, then convert back to a two-decimal number.
It would be less of a headache for everybody if the dominant denomination for bitcoin was the uBTC, whatever you want to call it.

People expect the same number of Dollars back when they get a refund. I don't see a huge difference there. Given the nature of bitcoin at the moment I understand why they did it the way they did, though I'd probably be a lot more disappointed if I was still waiting for that refund, knowing I'd only get back about 10% what I spent.

A lot of wealth disparity problems are caused by corrupt monetary systems that subsidize the rich at the expense of the poor, or government interference that prevents the natural flow of capital among the classes.
A free-market money like bitcoin doesn't do that stuff. Bitcoin's "rich" are getting a windfall for their past risks, and it is not at the expense of anyone.
Wealth disparity in itself isn't a problem. The market is always trending toward narrower profits and cheaper goods. Injustices that make the disparity grow are a huge problem, not because they create disparity, but because they are theft and fraud.

I'm on board.
This makes sense to me. People are used to money having only two digits after the decimal, and uBTC does that. But "micro" is a terrible word for it. I like "bits". BTC gets to be the big grand-daddy unit like an ounce of gold, bits become like "lire" or "dollars" or what have you, and perhaps the numbers after the decimal are "bitcents" (yes I know that was used already for hundredths of a BTC but the rest of the world doesn't know that).

I would have **supported** a fight to free the slaves. Defending the defenseless is one of the noblest things a human being can do. Covert teams of volunteers could have been sent to plantations to liberate slaves and transport them north. Private efforts had already put together the Underground Railroad. But what happened instead? Civilians were put to fire and sword during Sherman's March to the Sea, or hung in Lincoln's paradise of freedom for expressing dissent. Even if the war really was over slavery, in my opinion it doesn't help to fight fire with napalm.
As we see very acutely in cases like child abuse or murder, every act of evil reverberates through time, wreaking destruction on many victims long after. The evil practice of slavery, left unchecked for so long in the USA, had altered and ruined the lives of millions of African-Americans. It also created a poisonous culture of slave "owners." A thirst for power -- or a fear of losing any -- among the rulers of the federal government created some more evil when they refused to leave these monsters to their own devices and focus on eliminating slavery in swifter, more practical ways. The one ray of sunshine in that decade's Satanic parade of horrors was South Carolina's comparatively civilized choice to simply sever political ties with a body they felt no longer represented them. A reasoning, empathetic, practical human being could have chosen any one of thousands of possible responses that would eventually -- and bloodlessly -- result in the end of slavery and the reintegration of South Carolina. The fact that the central government reached first for their cannons and rifles should be instructive.

I got a refund once in BTC for something I paid BTC for, but my refund amount was adjusted for the changes in the exchange rate during that time, so I wound up getting about 20% less back.
I can understand that, since the business probably converted to USD right away and had to buy some BTC again to give me my refund.
I would hope that in the future if I buy something with BTC I can get the exact same BTC back if a refund is necessary. It feels dishonest for a business to be hanging on to your money temporarily only to give less of it back because of other people's buying and selling activity.

This isn't a case against bitcoin. It's a list of stock arguments against bitcoin. You could at least bother to capitalize your sentences.


Who decides what's tenable? You?


Thanks to Gyft, my bitcoin is good at Target, Amazon, Sears, and hundreds of other retailers. You can also buy electronics, illegal drugs, and tickets into space.


This will improve to whatever degree governments will permit it to improve. Germany and China and Canada seem to be having a pretty good time of it.


A market being small does not make that market non-viable. Just small.


...until the discounts you get with bitcoin are competitive with legacy cash. I'm going to do as much of my online spending as I can now through the combination of bitcoin and Gyft, because that gets better rewards than my credit cards, without creating any debt.


That's what I thought the first time it hit $100. Yet people keep buying.


The degree of anonymity is up to you.


Email had the same problem until someone invented AOL.


Same goes for cash and bank wires. Don't want t to get scammed? Don't fall for scams.


Who decides what's productive? You? Gambling is an entertainment product that Satoshi Dice is providing. Does it only count if people are paying construction crews with bitcoin? If it's a voluntary exchange, it is by definition making at least two people better off from their point of view.


Now you're just making up objections. Creating value takes effort. Proof-of-work takes effort. The expenditure of energy results in some entropy. Sorry Newton's laws don't obey your environmental sensibilities.
