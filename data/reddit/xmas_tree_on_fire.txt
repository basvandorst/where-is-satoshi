It's hilarious that he anticipated some backlash against half-naked women so included some half-naked dudes, too. He's completely oblivious to the fact that it's the half-naked that's the problem, not that it's a man or woman.
Not everyone wants to see that shit at a trade conference and you alienate a pretty big chunk of people when you hire booth bunnies. The BTC scene already has enough sex-starved neckbeards, I don't understand why they're trying to attract more.

He's had quite a few death threats from people he ripped off. If I was a scumbag like that, I'd be rolling deep with bodyguards too.
Edit: Shit like this:

I understand. Conferences like this are your rare chance to see a scantily-clad woman gyrating erotically. Someday, when you grow up, you might find a woman who can show you some fun without being paid to do it.

Not really. He's just some kid scamming other young, gullible, and greedy kids to the tune of a few million bucks. Kenneth Lay set up a sham business claiming over a HUNDRED BILLION DOLLARS of revenue that wiped out tens of thousands of innocent people when it collapsed. He was scamming millionaires, billionaires, corporations and nations.
Nobody saw through Kenneth Lay's scam until the end. Lots of people have seen through Josh Garza's scam from the beginning and have been very vocal about it.
So Josh Garza isn't in the same league, not even in the same ballpark. He's more of a Nigerian 419 scammer that scams greedy idiots. Everyone knows it's a scam. He's scamming a handful of desperate dreamers who would otherwise be spending their money on lottery tickets.

What was their response when you asked them directly?
