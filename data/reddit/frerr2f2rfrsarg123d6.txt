I don't think the [Ecash without a mint]( thread has been previously linked to. Could be wrong.

I noticed that as well and have seen many comment on that aspect of Satoshi's writings. It is also the way I was taught to type papers in grade school but I dropped the style long ago. It may suggest a possible age for Satoshi.

The only issue seems to be this author is well-aware of b-money while Adam Back has stated that Satoshi first learned of b-money via their private email correspondence in 2008. I still have a very hard time believing that -- not that I don't believe Adam.
Also note his description isn't a perfect description of modern day Bitcoin by far -- but that was 10 years prior. It has similar properties. The most interesting to me is using a distributed public double-spend database. Every scheme up until that time relied on centralized double-spend databases.

It wouldn't shock me to find out Anonymous was Szabo. He seems to clearly be missing from these conversations with his immediate contemporaries. Regardless of who Satoshi is, IMO credit is clearly owed to Back, Dai, and Szabo.

I suspect the other 3 had more direct involvement. Hal doesn't seem like he was in on it based on these comments on the initial announcement: 
I still don't know who Satoshi is but if I were absolutely forced to give a guess my best guess would be:
* Szabo is Anonymous from 1999. He had the key design insights to make Bitcoin work.
* Back wrote the white paper.
* Dai wrote the reference implementation.
Three Satoshis would make it difficult for people trying to find a single Satoshi. No one potential Satoshi completely fits but pieces of these 3 do.

Yup. Huge.

It was unremarkable in all aspects.

I've often wondered if Adam wrote the paper based mostly on circumstantial evidence: Adam is British, he uses double-spaces after full-stops, and in his 2002 [paper]( on Hashcash he includes as the final possible application:




Note that Satoshi also cites this paper. It would seem odd to me though that Satoshi was aware of Adam and read this paper, cited it, and still was unaware of b-money until it was pointed out by Adam.
I don't know if Adam wrote the bitcoin.pdf paper or not -- but I don't think he wrote the code based on its style and nature. It seems like Adam mostly wrote C code. At least I've seen no evidence of him using advanced C++. 
I've only seen one individual's code that looks at all similar to the original reference implementation and that author is Wei Dai himself. See early versions of [Crypo++]( The SHA256 implementation of which was included directly in the original Bitcoin code. I asked Wei about that recently and this was his response: 
Wei's claim to still have never read the bitcoind source code seems insane to me as it is the first working implementation of b-money and the white paper does not sufficiently explain the design, IMO.
