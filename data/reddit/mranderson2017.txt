If you’re interested in this kind of speculation it’s better to buy and sell bitcoin futures than try and time price movements. I’ve been doing it for a month or so and it’s a pretty decent way to earn extra BTC if you’re careful and only buy when the dips bottom out.

This is cool, though it makes me wonder what exactly should we be defining as a "correction" vs. a flash crash. In my mind if it drops ~30% and then goes back up in 2-5 days, it doesn't really seem like a correction. Doesn't a correction mean the market is slowly regressing to the true "value" of the currency at that point in time? Certainly dropping and rising in the matter of a few days isn't healthy, just some random market pressure that resulted in a flash crash.

There are ways of canceling transactions if they're still unconfirmed. It's a little tricky, but you can try them if it's a significant amount and you don't want to wait until the mempool clears up. Also you can try one of those transaction accelerators:

Dear Louise,
Thank you for your letter and concerns regarding my account. It is now clear to me that the money I am storing in your bank is no longer "mine" seeing as I'm not even able to perform simple transactions without an AVP Loss Prevention Officer being alerted. In light of this information I'd like to formally request that you close my account with your bank. 
It most definitely has not been a pleasure,

Bitcoin becomes more stable as time goes on, not less. The best strategy is to take gains out as you need/want them but most of the hardcore Bitcoin hodlers are in the game until Bitcoin becomes widely used as a currency, not to make money and just exit.

There's a reason the mantra around here is HODL. Learn from the community's experiences. Here are the lessons I carry in a nutshell:
1) HODL.
2) Don't short Bitcoin. Ever.
3) Never trade with more than 5x leverage in either direction.
4) Expect dips of up to 40% and HODL on through.
5) Don't try and play the day-trading game. You will lose. You may win a few times but you will eventually lose.
6) Dollar-cost Averaging and don't be so concerned about the price you get in at. If this thing goes to 100K, getting in at 10K vs. 15K makes little difference.

If the bread and milk shop you mentioned accepts Bitcoin, let me ask you this. Would they rather take Bitcoin from you or USD as payment? They'd probably even sell you the bread and milk at a discount if you paid in BTC because they expect it to go up very soon. What does this tell us? The bread and milk shop values Bitcoin more than USD, meaning USD has lost value to Bitcoin. If this was occurring at a macroeconomic scale, you can see what that would mean.

This has been covered pretty extensively. Simple answer is we hard fork with an updated quantum-resistant hashing algorithm. Current block chain will remain intact.
Quantum computing is progressing but there is no way it would be able to progress fast enough before we just simply hard fork and continue. The power is in our hands.

Let’s say the price is dropping from 10,500 and now it’s at 9900 and you think there’s still some drop left. You sell all your coins based on this fact. The very next minute news comes out that Bill Gates has decided to move 20% of his holdings into Bitcoin. The effect on the price is that it jumps 20%, then 30% and never comes down again. You’ll be left with a bunch of fiat or if you try and convert it back, even less bitcoin than before.

This brought something interesting to my attention. He mentioned that the US dollar has dropped 75% in value since he was born. The funny thing is, I don't think Bitcoin has ever dropped that much since it was launched. Seriously even the craziest drops near the beginning were only 50%-65% never 75% right?

Technical: A "bitcoin" is the unspent outputs from the discovery of a new "block" by miners in accordance with the Bitcoin protocol.
Basically it's just a new form of money with special attributes such as no central authority, limited supply, deflationary and several others. 
It's worth so much now because it's being discovered my mainstreamers who are starting to convert their current assets into Bitcoin in larger quantities than ever before.

I feel like Bitcoin is worth 1000x and so do thousands of people. Doesn’t mean anything until you vote with your dollars.
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:21:22
Actually, money DOES go INTO Bitcoin simply because as Bitcoin rises in value and use, other currencies "lose" value in tandem. The affect is so minuscule right now that you can't notice it, but it is there. The utility companies will end up with a lot of money from selling electricity, but the value of that money in 5-6 years time will not be the same as it is now if Bitcoin continues down this path.

I'll admit, I was terrified of this exact thought but I realized something. Who's trying to transact Bitcoin right now? If you're trading it's on an exchange so no fees. Transacting it is just not something you should even be doing in its current state, and I understand that many people will start throwing around "it was designed to be a currency, what do you mean you shouldn't be transacting it." Let me explain my thinking using a simple timeline:
2009 to 2011 - Discovery Phase
Bitcoin launches, it starts building a community of fans around it. But its still an experiment, nothing worthwhile and no one takes it seriously. Just for programmers to tinker around with.
2011 to 2015 - Utility Phase
Bitcoin turns out to be useful, something for real-world transactions. A small userbase starts to build around the network, miners, exchanges, etc. It finds the only market it can, the black market. It's being used for drugs, pirated movies and all that crap. But keep in mind these are real-world transactions and that's where the real magic is...because...
2015 to Today - Growth and Development Phase
This is something special, something that could change the world. Entire industries start to form around this incredible project. Be your own bank, power to the people, programmable money. People start seeing Bitcoin not as an experiment but as the infrastructure for commerce in the future. And they decide to invest in that infrastructure, because although it's clogged now we know the potential it has. 
Bitcoin is currently under construction. I know most people don't want to hear that but we've evolved past the phase where we're bootstrapping and testing this project. Now comes the heavy lifting. It's under construction but you can buy a piece of it now if you're willing to take the risk. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 04:43:47
Really interesting article, I'm glad we're already thinking about solutions in this direction. This or a similar mechanism can both reduce fees further and increase decentralization of lightning network.

Really depends on the kind of relationship you have with your parents. If they're generally supportive and understanding, I think you should tell them. If anything you may get more from your parents to invest for them. They can also probably give you advice on how to manage your newfound wealth. On the other hand if they're not so understanding, best to keep it to yourself.
I was in a similar boat and told my dad about my earnings, he was very impressed and after a few days he transferred me quite a significant amount of money to invest for him as well. Now our family "fund" is a lot larger than I had planned, and we own our fair shares in it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:44:59
Harsh words, but very true. I'm all-in on Bitcoin but even I can understand that if it can't survive this, my high-risk investment was ultimately just that, a high-risk investment that failed. If it survives (and I'm sure it will) we could be on the verge of something incredible. Time will tell.
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:49:03
Here's how I think about it everytime I ask myself this question.
Stop thinking about Bitcoin prices as the graph we always see online, the one that's so jagged and volatile. Imagine a straight diagonal line from the price now, to what you think it's going to be. If this is how the Bitcoin price will move, doesn't it make sense to buy as early as you can? The short-term graph of jaggedness and volatility will slowly start to resemble the line your imagining now with enough time.

I don't think routing nodes on LN will be concerned with the identity of the users participating in transactions. They're supposed to act as "side-chains" connecting users to process payments and then "consolidating" these transactions onto the main chain. If the nodes are compromised, users can just switch to different nodes. And it's not like a side-chain is any less private then the actual blockchain. In fact, I'm pretty sure it's more so because all these transactions eventually get collapsed and merged back into the main chain.

I came across Hexabot about a week ago. At the time I wasn't even aware there was such a thing as HYIPs and that they were scams. I legitimately thought it was a bot so I invested quite a substantial amount to see what I could get.
Afterwards I started doing some math and realized just how ridiculous the returns they promised were. 2% per day risk-free? 134,940% per year? That sounds too good to be true. So I started googling and found out all about HYIPs. At this point I started getting a little scared so I decided to pull my money out.
That said, when I decided to pull out, there didn't seem to be anything scammy about it. I simply withdrew my funds, sent them to my wallet and that was that. No delays, no questions, very clean. I even made a sizeable return on that initial investment.
So I decided to keep a little in it for now, but have withdrawn the majority of my money just to avoid any major risks.

So much this. I don't understand how mining Bitcoin is growing MORE popular all the time. Does no one first try and open one of those Hash/Profit calculators before making these huge investments? It's going to take an entire year just to pay the thing off, time during which a Bitcoin investment could be growing.

"If I didn't, my competitor would and that would put me at a disadvantage."
I think you've got this backwards, if an ISP charged fees to transact on Bitcoin, which by its nature is free, customers would flock to a competitor who ISN'T doing this.

I don't think this writer fully understands the purpose of mining and the blockchain. The very process of mining is what makes the blockchain irreversible and secure. Every dollar spent on mining is making the blockchain more secure, and therefore making the miner's investment more secure. It's the same as spending money on bank security, fraud prevention, insurance, etc. All the 'waseful' things in our society that help us protect our money supply is being replaced with something MUCH cheaper and more efficient, and it's seen as 'waseful' now? That's quite a premature statement to make in an article with literally zero research or citations. 
I don't even have to scroll down, this article is so short. And they think it's just that easy to dismiss how brilliant the idea of the blockchain is? 
For the first time in history we are using computers not to make things "more" efficient or faster, but using computation to make something "more" difficult as a means of securing data. It's a complete paradigm shift, and that's why I think most people don't understand it and see it as wasteful.

Well one thing to remember is that Visa and Paypal are not "fee-less." It's just that the merchant pays the fees and not you, so they are absorbed into the price of the product. When lightning network is released, the idea is that fees will become insubstantial. By this I mean that they will literally be less than even a small decimal percentage of your transaction. Almost like paying a quarter of a cent or something in real dollars. When you can transact as much as you want with such low fees literally instantly, Bitcoin will be scores better than Visa or Paypal.

Don’t get me wrong, I’m loving all this up/down action with BCH. When movements are so predictable it makes it pretty easy to short/long at profitable times. But every time I make money I know there’s some poor schmuck who bought into the nonsense that “BCH is the next BTC” and “get in now before the flippening” bullshit whose losing money. It’s similar to scamming people with penny stocks like they used to back in the 80s.

Bitcoin is not a company, it’s a software project and ecosystem that others can join. But there is no Bitcoin HQ, no bitcoin revenues/expenses or CEOs to make those sorts of decisions.
There are many companies out there that offer Bitcoin visa debit cards you can take a look at (Shift, Bitpay, SpectroCoin, Wirex). Some might eventually start offering credit cards as well.

Yea honestly. I mean do we attack gamers for being wasteful with their overclocked PCs? Is playing a PC game that uses an enormous amount of energy "unnecessarily" for better graphics any better than working to protect people's money supply? Aren't miners just playing a really big game trying to find the next block?
This is almost a $200 billion industry. It is so unbelievably arrogant to think that trying to protect all of this value is somehow "wasteful" because there's electricity costs associated with it. If securing the blockchain doesn't cost you something, what is Bitcoin worth then in the end?
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:23:52
Wise advice. I had the same problem and the realization that got me over it went something like “if I really think this thing can goto $50,000, and I really believe that, then whether I buy at 4000, 5000 or even 8000 doesn’t make much of a difference in the grand scheme of things.” It’s just a few hundred or thousand compared to the real long-term gains that I really believe are achievable.
