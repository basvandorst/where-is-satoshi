Why give your opinion when it was not requested and the deal is done?? 
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:17:49
So wanting something and buying it are not good?
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:07:32
This phrase is so annoying.  Mind your biz.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:19:01
So no grey area huh?  
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:48:07
Fucking exactly.  Why are people so happy to not adopt many of the children in this world that need homes but God FORBID you don’t adopt a dog.  What about the humans???!!!  
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:44:30
The whole deal is —- if anyone here has shipped at Walmart or Target, they are supporting unbearable working conditions for humans.  You don’t see anyone talking about their fucked up support of deplorable working conditions.  But God forbid—get a dog from a breeder and you should die a horrid death immediately.

Thank you.  Doing God’s work here.  I’m right there with you.  Fucking people and their opinions.  Why do people feel the need to tell people where to get their fur family members.  It drives me insane.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:51:14
Amen.  We have a rescue and a bred-dog.  We got the bred-dog for a specific purpose and let me tell you, we are so happy to have him.  We are paying out the ass for classes to stop our rescue from having sep anxiety.  Doesnt mean we love her any less, just means she is more work.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:01:23
Dude get off the soapbox.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:41:57
Yep.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:45:38
Exactly.  Like holy fucking hell.  And you better check where you are shopping bc all of these folks have at least shopped at a target or Walmart bc they are supporting deplorable working conditions for actual humans on this earth.  
@_date: 2017-12-20 22:12:29
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:27:49
You are exactly correct.  I’m just so sick of people jumping on other people for their own decisions.  Decisions that have nothing to do with the people attacking.  It’s so strange.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:45:45
Today, you have received a gold star!!!  I’m sure a lot of us do things to help animals and people without telling everyone.  Especially around the holiday season ;).  Good luck with your biz.  
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:46:05
So is your damn opinion.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:49:08
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:07:49
For Christ’s sake.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:20:04
Righto, gov.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:02:15
Oh. My. God.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:41:01
What in bloody hell are you talking about?  I am a cat cuddler and dog walker at our downtown shelter and I own a rescue as well as a dog from a breeder.  I don’t feel the need to tell people they should adopt, not shop.  It’s total assholish behavior and it drives me insane.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:45:53
Oh for crying out loud.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:07:05
Why do let yourself hate things that you can’t change?  
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:06:37
Because she wanted to?
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:05:28
Exactly.  Good Breeders care about each dog and will always take a dog back so that their dogs don’t end up in shelters.  If more people went to good breeders there would be far less dogs in the pound.  We have a rescue and a bred dog and the dog from our breeder has far less behavioral problems.  We are paying out the ass for classes for our rescue just so he can stop tearing apart the house from separation anxiety.  He also can’t be near any other dog without going ballistic (aside from his sister that we have here).  I would go well-bred any day moving forward.
