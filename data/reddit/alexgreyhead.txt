Bugger... I think you're right...
I might hold on to them until Christmas 2018 - that should give me enough time to think up something less-twattish...

I think it's a good idea meant in the right spirit. I wanted to do something similar this year with some close family members but struggled to get the tone of the messages right so in the end I've put some bitcoin aside for my nearest and dearest bit scrapped the idea to tell them this year - maybe by next year I'll have worked out how to word the gift card...!

Tl;dr - Ledger shouldn't use DPD as their UK courier :(
I bought a Ledger Nano from their French website - I'm in the UK.
Got a tracking number for the parcel. Parcel progressed through the French postal system with no problems - viva la France.
The second it got to the UK the problems occurred; entering the tracking number on the DPD website showed that a "while you were out" calling had been left at my house, but there was no card.
I arranged redelivery and stayed home to greet the postman. No postman arrived, but DPD reckoned they'd left another calling card.
This happened twice more, with a light sprinkling of me phoning DPD and getting through to a slightly-highly-strung phone operator...  ).
Thankfully, in the end, there was a happy outcome - my Ledger Nano S was returned to Ledger HQ in France and they refunded me for the full cost of the Ledger Nano S, which I put towards a Trezor :(
I would have rather had a Ledger Nano :((

Everybody who's pointed out this is a bit of a cringe move on my part; you're right. I'm going back to the drawing board. ��

That makes sense. No need for big gestures. ����

I read that as, "in lieu of LSD"...
