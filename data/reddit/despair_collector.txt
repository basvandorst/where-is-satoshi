I felt like Warren Buffet after buying in 2012, then hodling much of 2013.. Hedled in 2014, feel like the biggest moron in the universe.

If Wall ST. was really interested in bitcoin, they would have bought if from the SR auction directly. It went from 45 firms in the first auction, then 11 the next.

We got this guys! The whale is down to 17k. Man the Harpoons! We're gonna get lots of whale oil, my friends!

And yet you didn't.

I've been in the finance industry for 23 years, and we've hit triple bottom. There's an ascending pendant triangle forming which usually means there's a huge rally around the corner. Add to the fact that we have Microsoft, PayPal, Dell, Overstock, Ebay and ETF soon supporting the BTC infrastructure, it will usher in a new round of investors, this time from Wall St. hereby increasing upward pressure.

It's not; no one really gives a shit about the ETF. There won't be demand, and when people realize that, prepare to see sub $200s.

Yep, l knew it. Looks like Professor Mugs!

Good time to dump when the masses start buying..
@_date: 2015-05-09 21:43:05
I don't really like bitcoins. I just want to get rich off of them.
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:48:21
 Lost about $200,000. yeah, to the moon.
@_date: 2015-01-13 15:29:25
Hodling since $12. You guys can bag hold for me. LOL
@_date: 2015-01-14 07:11:08
It's all margins from here on out. Having said that, I don't like my margins getting thinner so I'll stay out of this one.

Can you elaborate on Quadriga's shadiness?
@_date: 2015-01-05 04:11:48
K dipshit, it may not be "reasoning" but it turned out to be true. How do you feel about bagholding? Here, let me dump some more. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 07:04:02
How much have you lost so far?
@_date: 2015-07-13 07:59:21
I'd argue that SR takedown wasn't really bad news. Some people said it makes BTC more legitimate. We lost our case here. For bitcoin to rally, we need more bad economic shit going on.
@_date: 2015-07-13 08:34:46
Oh yeah, we rallied because a mom and pop store around the corner started accepting BTC.  It's also a puuure and meaningless coincidence that as soon as a Greek bailout has been announced, we simply happened to crash for no apparent reason. /s
@_date: 2015-07-13 07:57:34
The point is, this whole rally was centered around Grexit. With Greece getting bailed out, we have no gimmick. This bull rally is over. Short is the wise move at this point.
@_date: 2015-07-13 07:09:03
Lol. I actually drew that pic! 
@_date: 2015-07-13 08:13:49
Bro, I'm one of the most successful bitcoin speculators out there. I started in 2012 and still going strong. I'm with team BTC, trust me. But, over the last few months I realized there's nothing wrong with switching sides every now and then and make an absolute mint. 
@_date: 2015-04-28 07:55:05
As someone who massively profited from bitcoin in 2013-2014.... i'd rather keep profiting than bag holding.
@_date: 2015-04-27 00:07:26
Ah, this short was fairly nice.  Thanks, bears.
@_date: 2015-09-08 04:25:55
Hate to be that guy.. but someone has to do it. How many bitcoins did you lose?
@_date: 2015-09-08 08:50:21
Especially since BTC just rallied.. 
@_date: 2015-02-02 12:10:46
Don't try to misinterpret what I said. Is China pumping BTC like they used to? 
@_date: 2015-02-02 10:37:35
The fundamentals hasn't changed. No demand, no Willy, no China. If you're gonna get involved in Bitcoin, it's best to short.

Claim them as Capital Gains instead. You'll pay less taxes that way.
