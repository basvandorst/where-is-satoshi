Too many problems with this proof of concept and comments from the OP here. 
- First of all, it is called Zero Click, that means you have to be ready for the heat on confirmation dialogs, security, limits etc. (Personally I don't believe that zero click is possible at all) 
- HTTP protocol 402, I don't understand what is the benefit of this, also sounds like the worst choice for this action. It is "Reserved for future use", means practically 'please don't use this code'. This is what standards are for. Actually you can do the same with any custom HTTP header. 
tbh I would prefer an url scheme like (btcpay://) cross browser and can be widely recognized/adopted by multiple wallet apps etc, so sites can redirect me to my wallet with an (URL, btc address, btc amount) and my wallet can handle the rest, and when done it can redirect me to the URL ( assuming btc address is unique for my visit and payment )  and page can check btc address has received the payment ( can also let me wait till it confirms, depending on the server settings )

"As demonstrated, while it is possible to change the creation date reported by most software, it is not possible to do so in a manner which cannot be detected. Since there is no evidence of that type of manipulation within the file, it is clear that the timestamp is accurate." 
All conclusion actually relies on this, so that means if we can manage to manipulate creation date, in a way that cannot be detected, it's worth $20k in this situation?

This should be up, you need backup password to access keys, otherwise adding a new device is meaningless by itself
