If you own a house outright with no debt what do you care someone else tells you it's worth?
Tangible items always will be tangible items correct?

My suggestion. Cash it all out and pay off a house in full. Living mortgage free would be amazing and real estate is one of the safest investments you can make.

I agree an items worth is only what someone else will give you for it. I think we are here discussing apples and oranges a bit.
Owning a home outright, as in holding the paper deed, is a different situation than financing a home. Not having to pay your mortgage would open up plenty of other opportunities. Let's say a mortgage payment for example is $800-$1000-ish, that's $800 you could use to pay off debt/travel/invest/whatever. This isn't including the option of turning this home into a rental, GENERATING $800-ish a month in additional income in a month. In the event you need to sell I would much rather have the deed to a home than shares of stock in a company. 
I don't know your area but it seems like you got a phenomenal deal, but that doesn't mean that your neighbor got a bad deal by any means. If they have the ability to pay the mortgage and not stretch themselves financially maybe it was a great decision for them. For instance I got a decent deal on my home a few years ago but I had to buy a new home to get my kid in the school district I wanted. Maybe this home has lower taxes, no Mella rouse tax, or hoa.
I guess ultimately my point is I agree a home may not be a fool proof investment strategy but if I woke up with 100k of imaginary space bucks (fiat or cryptocurrency) that is what I would try and convert it to.
