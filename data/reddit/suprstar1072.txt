I have good cooling, all chip temps are always good.  I notice if I tweak my fan%, it'll make the boards fail more or less. I was at 60% for a long time with no problem, thought it was heat too.  I recently went from 100% to 85% and have had no failures in several days now.  I feel like the fan resonance / vibration of the unit has something to do with it.

Mining contracts are almost ALL scams.  Why would a company just give you profits when it assumes all the cost and risk of equipment maintenance and breakdown, fluctuating energy costs, hvac, hashrate SLA's, BTC value, etc..?  It's a scam bc you do the arithmetic and see that it's a positive return.  For NOW.  The bit they dont tell you is how much more hashrate and higher difficulty will decrease your returns every month until it's not even profitable any more.  This happens before you make back your contract investment.  
The Antminer S9 miner made 0.4 BTC per month a year ago, it's making 0.08 BTC now.  That's how fast the returns drop off.
@_date: 2017-12-28 05:37:26
Hey, if did the arithmetic and it's profitable - fuggit bust it out, who doesnt want some extra bits in their wallet!  You are effectively buying BTC from the electric co at a discounted rate.
But I'm guessing 0.007BTC/month tops tho, I think youre a bit optimistic at 0.009-0.01.  An S9 is getting 0.08 and does &gt;10x the hashrate.  If I had one sitting in my closet, hell yeah plug it in.  Would I spend $500 on one now, probably not. An s7, probably. An s9, absolutely.  
Will you break even, maybe, good luck!  You can always sell the S5 later too especially if BTC price stays high, which is highly probable.

Refurbished anything turns me off big time.  If someone bought it and it worked great and they are still profiting off it, they wouldn't send it back.  Refurb'ed shit is more susceptible to breakdowns, problems, outages, etc..  I used to cheap out and buy refurbed.  Especially in electronics, refurb'ed is just asking for problems.  Sometimes you win, sometimes you dont.
You didnt mention the price, the price is low for a reason..  Have you done the arithmetic to see if you can get your investment back in 1 month, 2 months, 6 months, ?  You understand and know why your miner will earn less and less every month, and factored that into your equation above?

Just flat out saying "zero" isn't really fair.   I certainly offload most of it right away, and right now I have $0 on the exchanges.  But sometimes it's practical to keep some on there.  
If you buy small amounts every week using DCA (dollar cost averaging), maybe you want to save up a certain amount so you can send it to your wallet all at once, thus saving bitcoin transaction fees.  Exchange transaction fees are on the high side to make sure they get processed fast.  Do you want to pay 4 $4 fees on 4 $50 tx's, or 1 $5 fee on a single $200 tx.
You can try your hand at selling the big spikes when you KNOW it can't hold and is gonna drop back down shortly.  You can sell the spikes without having to xfer from your wallet back to the exchange, which requires an additional transaction fee and who knows how much time.   
Some exchanges even have API's so you can program all this stuff to happen automatically.

Not critical of mining, but I AM critical of noob's coming in and saying they'll but a couple S9's and "recoup their investment in 6 months" when they dont understand how much difficulty and the gazillions of new S9's in the pools affect their ROI's.
Ppl are spending enough fiat to buy a decent car on ASIC miners.  I have a xls going from the time I started mining with a single S9.  I would be many thousands of USD's ahead if I had just bought BTC at the time.  I will profit, yes.  But I may never mine the amount of BTC I could have just bought outright. At best I might asymptotically approach that amount but IDK if I'll ever reach it.  Everyone who was knowledgeable in this sub and everywhere else told me the same fn thing, it's not as obvious as it looks.

Coinbase is not a wallet.  Coinbase took your fiat and has issued you an IOU for BTC, but you don't actually possess your BTC if it's in your Coinbase account.  If you dont have the keys, it is NOT yours!  Cash in your Coinbase "IOU" **RIGHT NOW** and transfer your cryptos to your own wallet.  For smaller amounts, Coinomi is a good free hot wallet for your phone that manages tons of coins.  For larger amounts, Trezor and Ledger are the leading hardware wallets.

@_date: 2017-11-15 07:08:30
You can try, but consider it gambling.   It's really hard to predict which direction the market is going short term.  You might see a quick spike up sell a bit and wait for the correction.  Then it comes back down and you buy it back.  What goes wrong is when you wait a little too long and it starts going back up again, and your buy order never goes thru bc the price is rising / holding / rising / etc.....  You bid a penny below value and it just doesnt dip back until it's past your sell point anyway, now you lost.
I played around for a while with a very small balance, I'd get +1% her +3% there, then the scenario above happens and I lose it all back and then some.  Most ppl agree you'll lose unless you have inside information, and.or enough money in the market to actually make the market move the direction you want it to.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:53:30
That is a really low fee, it's literally $0.02, ie 2 cents.  Miners will go after the transactions with higher fees, since they get paid the fees when they create the block.  That transaction will be about the last one they take, so you'll have to basically wait til the mempool is empty and there's no other better transactions to process.  Could be an hour, a day, a week,  who knows.  Super-low-fee and even free transactions used  to go all the time, but now there's more transaction volume, so miners prioritize.

@_date: 2017-11-15 08:37:18
Disclaimer - this is how it works on GDAX.  Placing buy/sell orders means your transaction happens for free.  IF if happens.  It might not, because:
You have to place a buy order for UNDER the current rate.  if the price is going up, it never drops to your buy-in price and your order won't get filled.
Similarly you have to place a sell order ABOVE the current price.  If the price is going down, it wont hit your sell point.
If you want to just buy at market value, then you pay a small fee.

An s9 costs about $3000 USD unless you want to wait a couple months, and it grosses about 1BTC/year.  A good chunk of that will pay your electric bill.  If you want to do it just to play around, great, but it's not the most profitable way to spend that $.
If the value of BTC rises even a quarter of what it did last year, you'll be waaaaay better off just spending the $3k on BTC now.  You could buy about 0.4 BTC now and you wont have to worry about your miner breaking down, ventilation (they run VERY hot), huge electric bills, increased difficulty and increased hashpower driving down your monthly returns, resale value of your miner in a year, etc.  There are a LOT of factors to consider.

And as long as no more miners start mining so difficulty doesn't increase, but that's a pipe dream.  Consider this:
1 year ago, difficulty was less than 20% what it is now.  That means 1 antminer was grossing 0.4 BTC per month then, now you're getting about 0.08.  Bitmain is churning out miners by the thousands, as fast as they can.  They can't even keep up, they're backordered 2 months.  Imagine what it'll be a year from now.
What if you bought $2k of BTC now, then bought $150-200 every month instead of paying it on your increased electric bill?

My workstation runs 24x7 anyway, so no additional cost there.  Unless you want to count negligible cpu cycles using negligible extra energy.

I think I'm paying about an average rate in the US, ~0.115USD/kWh.  
How long, idk.  Maybe in a year the s11 will be released and hashrate will be exponentially higher and an s9 would be insignificant and unprofitable, that's a really good q.  It could very well be the fiat is better spent just buying BTC right now instead of speculating on all that - I think that'd be the case if you bought an s9 a year ago and mined all year, despite the huge increase in btc price - vs buying 2.5-3 BTC late 2016.

On my S9 fans are at 85% now, havent rebooted for over a month. Re the code and keys - you need to add the above script as a cron job to a linux box.  To get the key pair for the ssh / reboot command, go on the linux box where the cron runs and run:
ssh-keygen -t rsa
at a command line.  Append the public key to:
so you can ssh in and issue a reboot command without a password.

Nice that the A3 has the same api!  Do your A3 hashboards blink out every now and then?  I found the perfect fan speed setting and I haven't needed a reboot since about the time I made the OP.

Then lets say the miners with the top 10% power costs stop mining since it's unprofitable now.  Next difficulty adjustment will go down and now it becomes profitable again for the miners with lowest power costs in that bunch.  It's a self-balancing system and the margins are thin.  The big mining farms are located in places with practically free power compared to what I'm paying.

Open a command prompt and run the command "netstat -a"  Any line that has 8333 in the local address column is a connection to your node.  The one exception is the first linke that says LISTENING - that's your server accepting connections on that port.
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:36:46
On a linux / mac you can run:
netstat -anp | grep 8333
to see the connections, or
netstat -anp | grep 8333 | wc -l
to get a simple count.
I know Windows has netstat but IDK what the flag are, or what the equivalent of 'grep' is.
@_date: 2017-10-27 11:52:26
Why not?  Everyone says this but I'm not getting it.   An s9 costs $100/mo in electricity to run and gets something like .09-.1 BTC/mo (&gt;$500/mo) at the current difficulty.  Plus it'll cut your heating costs in the winter lol...
@_date: 2018-07-27 11:12:59
You dont need internet access, and your coins can be 100% offline indefinitely.  As long as you can keep your passphrase / keys in ANY form.  If you can get on the internet for 10 seconds, you can acquire and keep bitcoin forever.

If you follow best security practices, its LESS necessary than with Windows.  If I can get you to install my game/util, if I can watch you type in a password, if you have a weak password, if you have any vulnerable services running, an old buggy java, etc....  There's a lot of ways people can get into your machine.  You can minimize risk, not remove it.

Yes technically possible.  But I've never even seen an md5sum collision after billions, and there are a huuuuuuuge magnitude more bitcoin keys combinations out there.  You literally have a million times better odds winning the powerball jackpot 10x in a row.

You need to have your edge device forward port 8333 to your full node.  If you have a standard home broadband setup,  that'd probably be the router you connected to your cablemodem.
@_date: 2017-10-27 12:18:54
I have, I just feel like there's something everyone else knows that I dont.  Difficulty rising cuts into returns. Bitmain selling s9's truckloads at a time, more miners definitely == diluted returns.  But I dont feel it cancels out a 500+% return.  Im considering it as well but kinda scared to pull the trigger so Im trying to understand reasons people don't think it's viable.

Please define "economic node", I'm not understanding this.  I can run a full node with NO investment in bitcoin, and I have as much influence on the network as a node run by someone with thousands of bitcoins.  A node is a node.  If you're talking about pruned nodes or something, please clarify.  No node "controls" any amount of bitcoin.
