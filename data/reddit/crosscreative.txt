Sure, they can...but they didn't. I've been watching coinbase pro like a hawk and it was never being traded near those prices. Every fraction of a coin matters, and I should receive what I agreed to pay for.

Yeah, buying on Coinbase is shady as fuck. The charts say one price and then if you look closely before you actually buy, they jack the price up and hope you don't notice.

I'm definitely never using Coinbase again for a straight purchase. The fact that this is happening and no one seems to be saying anything about it seems absurd to me. Had the price been somewhere in the trading range for that time period I wouldn't have gave it a second thought, but it jumped out at me since I've been trading all night and knew it never jumped that high.

Honestly, I don’t even care if someone is simply karma whoring. Keeping crypto on the front page isn’t a bad thing and this community has displayed its power to easily to do so. Doesn’t even have to be this damn gif. Let’s upvote news daily.

I just sold a good chunk of coin to take a vacation. Price will probably moon now. You're welcome.

I figured thats the exact response I'd get if I reached out. But the amount is just ridiculous, especially when coinbase pro is showing it was never being traded near that area. Bullshit, but I'm not sure what to do. They shouldn't be able to get away with that.

I took some profits at 13. Was hoping for another pump before selling this chunk, but it didn’t pan out. Cutting losses at 10 since its trending down right now. Will be back in 2 weeks to reinvest. I’m expecting a good bounce here soon, just don’t climb too high without me while I’m gone!

Hopefully it’s the fact that their is belief in bitcoin as a currency and society can finally move towards a decentralized banking system...the volatility is just an added bonus in the mean time.

You are solely responsible for this price hike. Pat yourself on the back OP. Thank you!

Their fee is. It's listed right on the receipt.
It would appear they are trying to sneak in a half percent unnoticed. Now that may not seem like a lot, but this also means I didn't receive the amount of coin I agreed to purchase when I hit buy. Amounts of coin that may end up growing by much more than half a percent and were essentially just stolen from me.

I do. In fact it's been years since I've used coinbase, but I felt like buying a chunk of coin and didnt want to wait the week for the money to clear. I feel like I just got ripped off pretty hard. I cant imagine complaining to coinbase support is going to yield desired results. This seems extremely shady and possibly illegal? I understand the price is constantly fluctuating, but to say it was a price that coinbase pro says it wasnt even near for the past half hour?
