The reason for the scarcity comment is it's like dollars if they were only going to make 1 million of them.

wish there was a way to recover my lost paper wallet
@_date: 2019-07-11 02:26:00
still...way to go!
@_date: 2019-11-19 11:27:30
Yeah this is bad but it was definitely a wife attack.  Still cheap education all things considered.

I'd rather buy some long dated SPY calls honestly....

First thing I would do is buy short expiry options...then I could buy anything I wanted.
You have fore-knowledge of the next 10 years...bitcoin is a good idea but this is actually a very short-sighted response. You could be a billionaire in a day or a few days...then you could buy all the btc, or whatever you want.
@_date: 2019-11-05 16:28:26
in a decade? maybe not in 100 years......
@_date: 2019-11-20 15:04:18
Then it deserves to die and hint it wont
@_date: 2019-11-05 18:20:47
I'm betting the status quo persists.
@_date: 2019-11-05 18:10:08
Ahhh the grammar correction,  the last refuge....
@_date: 2019-11-05 18:11:25
I'm hoping you are right but that doesn't mean I'm going to stop stacking cash.
@_date: 2019-11-06 20:44:28
IRS is the legit worst, don't try and box with them.

God woke solvent

Take your upvote.

You only need one play to 10000x so take your one shot it's all you need.
@_date: 2019-11-20 14:11:59
I'd be so rich I wouldn't care
@_date: 2019-11-19 05:53:17
Yea got thrown out most likely.
@_date: 2019-11-05 18:26:20
Explains the total disconnect with reality.

1.34btc was my donation.  Paper wallets 2013
@_date: 2019-08-12 03:39:38

@_date: 2019-10-09 15:33:49
Good, they are some of my favorites and I was worried I'd only get to see them once... the second time was just as good...
@_date: 2019-10-08 21:17:00
I think getting checks is great. Take a picture of it and its digital.
@_date: 2019-08-27 14:26:28
well I can promise I've personally helped to raise the price by losing &gt;1btc
@_date: 2019-10-09 02:37:59
Buy equities (fzrox or vtsax). They'll inflate from all the QE just as well.

Looks like it's time to start a robbery gang in east palo alto, literally can't go tits up.
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:10:23
could've just as easily lost his ass.. it's hard to time markets.
@_date: 2019-06-14 20:36:31
I love the idea of a crypto mitigating all the advantages of same...
@_date: 2019-06-21 17:53:21
From the perspective of the government, what is it?
@_date: 2019-10-16 23:49:05
Lots of us threw out paper wallets back in the day.
@_date: 2019-10-30 12:46:37
clearly he has a WSB grasp of stats....
@_date: 2019-06-20 19:36:28
No, fraud is much more profitable than bitcoin speculation. :D

@_date: 2019-09-28 20:45:13
Don't recommend unless you like losing BTC. Id love to get that sheet of paper back.
@_date: 2019-09-26 12:44:42
Thanks for saving me the time of this reply. "Freedom shouldn't be allowed!" Sounds Aussie to me....
