Bettercoin, my apologies.  Sorry for upsetting you, you are free to disagree.  I have updated the letter to reflect your concern.

We will very likely need Mt. Gox customer approval from each individual to release their records as per legal considerations at this point.  We should put together a website/petition with a way for customers to identify themselves and grant Mt. Gox the right to do so.

"We have also made it harder for anyone to complain that multistakeholder governance is just a fig leaf for US pre-eminence.” &lt;-- No they haven't, fig leaf status is pretty obvious.

I think this is a win for everyone on some level.  Mark K can play the good guy and show us he is trying to do what is right, while still retaining some equity in his creation.  Gox depositors get a chance to redeem their losses through trading fee income, paid out as dividends (or upon a later sale of their shares).  Gox, in turn, becomes more trustworthy because of the new ownership and mangement that will follow.  Bitcoin gets an exchange owned and operated by a broad array of Bitcoiners--not a decentralized exchange, but decentralized ownership is a step in the right direction.  Proponents of other exchanges will be happy that bankruptcy will be avoided, which would provide years of negative headlines that could be used to stifle Bitcoin adoption.

I agree.  Banking was one aspect I did not include in here.  I have passed this on to people in the banking community for insight.  Banks compete for business like any other industry, if an exchange is run professionally a bank should have less of an issue.  Mt. Gox was anything but professional. Consultants I have spoken with who did work for Mt. Gox also informed me Karpeles was cheap.  He had tons of capital and would not deploy it on competent professionals to assist him, opting to do everything himself.

Thank you for agreeing with the substance of this idea, anything material you could add would be greatly appreciated.  Sorry you don't like my taste in pop-art, or agree with my scorn for Mark's actions.  The events at Mt. Gox are his fault.  His soliciting new deposits when he knew he knew Mt. Gox was empty is fraudulent.  The recent acknowledgement of the 200k bitcoins should have taken place two weeks ago when he moved them.  The supervisor of the Mt. Gox estate in Japan had no idea these coins were being moved until they were informed by our lawyers and Mark only now announces he has them after legal pressure was brought to bear. I would love to hear an opposing viewpoint suggesting why we should support him at this time and would approach such discussion with an open mind.  My initial letter in early February suggested forgiving Mark for what happened, but since that time all the evidence I have seen suggests culpability.

I agree.  We need to be bigger than the money.  I lost a lot of money here, as did many other people.  But the idea of Bitcoin and what it represents is more important.

Bitcoin based business must hold earnings and profits in something other than bitcoin.  See 200.8(b).  He must be joking.

Hi Karl, thanks for your questions. I'll answer them in order.
- Yes.
- Yes, people would be giving up the right to immediately spendable bitcoin on an exchange for shares that could be sold privately.  When this was conceived, Mt. Gox had virtually no assets and we had nothing to lose.  We needed to solicit new investors and much of the proposal was aimed at a clever way of maximizing the potential for that.  Now the situation has changed.  People should be thinking about whether it makes sense to risk their share of the assets on a new exchange.  To do this they need to evaluate the risks (which didn't need to be done when there were hardly any assets).  I am now turning to risk-analysis and and hope in a week or so to be able to provide a reasoned assessment.
- Dissolve.
- Transfer to bankruptcy.
-Have not.  There were plans, but the emergence of the 200k requires a reevaluation first. 
-Not sure yet given the 200k "discovery".

Perhaps Satoshi will get involved if he sees everyone acting in the best interests of Bitcoin.  That is what we are advocating.

I believe the US is a poor choice of jurisdiction because of the regulatory framework: 50 different sets of state laws all requiring licensing as a money service business, but all with different requirements and rules.  Not to mention federal regulation.  Singapore or Hong Kong both represent excellent options, in my opinion.

I am currently in discussion with other individuals who have lost thousands of coins (thousands apiece) who favor this plan.  As for Mark, we need to keep an open mind entering discussions, as does he. I am not saying I disagree with anything you wrote, just that I am willing to enter the discussion with a 100% open mind.  Getting him to the table is the first step.  I hope that this letter receives enough attention to make it to him.  If you agree, please do what you can to spread the message.

"Save Gox" began as a plan filed in secret in the Tokyo courts that had to be leaked to the public for discussion on its terms to be considered.   Thereafter, creditors discovered that Brock's team wanted to use substantial sums of creditor money to pay themselves salaries and fund operations while locking up all creditor assets for a year.

It would not be Mt. Gox, but a different entity after a reorg.  It would have totally different management, which you would be a part of.

I was pushing to have him detained from day one.  I have been in Japan working with lawyers for three weeks to secure assets and the CEO.  One of the biggest barriers is the lack of understanding about bitcoin across the legal system. See my post at danielkelman.com for more on this.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:12:20
The first step is to get this to Mark's attention and get him to see the value in what we propose.  We need him to approach this with an open mind and we need to enter with an open mind.  Once we have heard both sides, we can add more requirements.  All else is premature.  Mind you, I do not disagree with you on any of these counts.
@_date: 2014-02-26 11:58:11
Your points are well taken, but the first step is seeing if Mark will consider this--let's not put the cart before the horse.  Even if it takes time, it will make for better headlines than bankruptcy litigation.  As for 2(a) (I take it you mean under "substantial points", Gox's brand being dead with no assets), you make a good point.  However, I think its more Karpeles' brand being dead than Gox's.  If there is substantial management and ownership restructuring, I think the Bitcoin public would be more trustworthy of such an exchange and approve of community ownership.  As for the assets, we really don't know what assets are left, it partly depends on that.  But there will be loads of free media coverage if this were to happen.  That is something that a new exchange couldn't count on.

I agree.  But I feel transparency could help here as well.  If an exchange is being independently audited and it opens its books to the public, there is much less of a chance for fraud.  This should appease banks.  It is more complicated than this, obviously, but this would go a long way.  There are no exchanges doing this.

Im responding to emails, I'll get to you.  We are working on organzing something bigger now and have investors with large holdings of Bitcoin tied up in Gox on board.

We want to build a new exchange.  It will be centered around transparency and other values important to the community.  It is up to everyone to help frame this discussion.  We feel that operating an exchange committed to values and the well being of the community, rather than the well being of the CEO, is what is best for Bitcoin.  Please check projectgox.com on a regular basis, as of now we are planning on using that site to keep people informed.

Thank you Olivier for taking a stance and sponsoring this contest instead of simply purchasing a Platinum Membership in the Bitcoin Foundation. And thanks Mike and Project Douglas for your innovative work. I expect that by permitting contributors to have more control over what projects get funded and in what amounts that the net value contributed to development will increase.   A decentralized organization that empowers individuals to participate in bitcoin's development, without having to sponsor projects with which they disagree, is what is needed.   Abandoning the centralized organization model represented by the Bitcoin Foundation will benefit the community.

Mark filed for a civil rehabilitation, which allows the debtor to remain in possession and run the company.  The court has some say, but doesn't really understand how bitcoin works and will let Mark do his thing.  This is why those 200k bitcoins moved a couple weeks ago.  The bankruptcy supervisor was letting Mark operate in good faith.  After two weeks of pressure from lawyers we finally have them acknowledged.  So imo its not enough to just assume the court has this under control, we need to be proactive.
