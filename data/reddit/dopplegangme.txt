I just heard this in the car on the way home from work and the other planet money story on the way to work... I am kind of glad to see they took a more accurate approach in this story.  In fact, I hesitate to say, but this report sounded positive.  They stopped to basically re-introduce people to bitcoin, take a second to describe how it works, and then delved into the details.

Yes she created the tool that resulted in the financial crisis of 2008. She did so in response to the Exxon Valdez spill which besieged JP Morgan, the new owner of the company, with millions of dollars of new debt. Several years later credit default swaps were applied to sub prime mortgages by other firms who saw its utility and potential for abuse, which actually caused the financial crisis.

But most people wont check right.  And so these site managers probably know that.  Can it be fudged?  It's my understanding that faking seeding and hash would be next to impossible.

Wow thank you jesus, that was incredibly well explained.

Im still trying to determine if I have to keep my activities secret.  I plan to use the currency on SR and would like to limit traceability

I am also experiencing longer transaction times.  Small amounts should have cleared last night but are still pending.  There have been a lot of posts regarding this and its likely due to Coinbase's recent user growth.  
Growing pains are a bitch, but I trust them... (hopefully not famous last words)

Yea since adopting it this week and checking frantically, I am beginning to better understand the volatilty.  This post was more a knee jerk reaction... think Gob and "I ve made a huge mistake"

I am unclear about the offline wallet transfer.  Namely the step involving generating an offline wallet and broadcasting a transaction. Is there a step-by-step I could find somewhere?
@_date: 2013-09-05 02:51:58
Admittedly I definitely didnt do enough research before this.  However, when I say hundreds... its like $200, but I was worried about losing more and if I had made a mistake taking BTC.  It seems like an instant conversion program would be good but I was planning on using the currency as well in the future.  I guess I just was not prepared for such large fluctuation and wanted to know if its normal 
@_date: 2013-10-25 03:40:50
That makes sense, I was just surprised how well you knew the site interface.  You definitely got me interested, I just need to figure how much I am willing to lose before I risk it.  Any word on condition of the site?
@_date: 2013-10-26 23:21:10
So Im like the guy who just came in, looking for a place to put his coat down, while everyone else is just standing around the punch making small talk with low volume music in the background.  It's too early in the evening to crank the volume up on that shit and break out the coke but there is already an energy in the air, a feeling of imminent excitement (or maybe impending doom).  It doesnt matter. The important thing is that I am here and I know that soon, others will join, and it really doesn't matter where the night ends up because it's gonna be one hell of a wild ride.
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:26:46
I have faith in the long run, but I also want to turn my profits into more bitcoins! I think I should adopt a "buy-only" philosophy as you point out to save myself some stress.

Maintaining security has been tough for me.  I am not very tech savvy, but I really want bitcoin to succeed so I embrace it.  But switching between "hot" wallets and "cold" storage required a lot of read up for me and I still find myself putting trust in what I read here.  In fact, for as much time as I have spent trying to learn how bitcoin works, from the mechanistic intricacies to the potential economic impacts in the future, I would say I still have a very poor understanding.  Before I found bitcoin, I stacked silver, and still do, so distrust of fiat was not new.  But I love holding the silver, knowing its mine.  I wish I could do that with bitcoin. I am very paranoid I will make a stupid mistake or leave myself open to hack/id theft. The biggest surprise I have encountered is people's reaction.  I was so excited to tell others about getting into bitcoin and some responded to that, but others look at me like a criminal.  Its pretty crazy.  Can't wait to see where we go in a couple years.  
@_date: 2013-10-21 19:24:04
Interesting. This is like futures trading right?  How many bitcoins do you need to effectively use this service?  Can you quantify the risk?  This seems like a dangerous tool for someone with little understanding.
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:24:42
What's the best method to create cold storage paper wallets? Is it necessary to download the full btc client for this? Is there a guide to make sure I don't f up and send coins to the ether?
Thank you!

If you just want to hold bitcoins, put a little bit of savings towards it each week/month.  If you dont have a job right now, find something you might be wiling to sacrifice.  For me, (also dont have a job), I made all my lunches for a week at home and saved $50 that week.  I opened a coinbase account and bought a little more than .25 btc.  When I have more money, I'll buy more, but for now, this is what I can afford and after about a month, I have 2.2btc
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:15:06
Thanks - I really am this inept when it comes to financial things.  Science and Medicine, I'm your guy.  I am really interested in Bitcoin, more than finance, but that interest has prompted this recent push in self education.  I never payed attention in those undergrad econ classes haha.

We had made a few transactions through the week and were planning on converting half our bit coins to fiat on Friday.  Our prices are matched to the exchange rate.  So basically earlier this week, people paid for stuff at a 10% discount because we held the BTC

Dont judge, but its a custom clothing store in a college town.  We take your designs then screen print them.

It definitely sounds convenient.  We dont use QR codes really, are they easy to generate?
@_date: 2013-09-05 05:00:32
It was a whim.  I work in a college town and we employ students, and so I hear a lot about them, but I really didnt appreciate their volatility.  Research was certainly lacking.  Thank you for your advice.
@_date: 2013-09-05 14:02:19
Every week, we convert about half of that weeks income to cover the overhead costs. The other half we let ride since many of us use BTC in our personal lives.
@_date: 2013-10-24 15:01:44
So the price is dictated by buy and sell orders and how many are taking place at any one time?

I know very little about trading (so perhaps it is not something I should be doing), but I have heard others mention it is a good way to grow your wallet.  I would certainly want to be well informed before beginning.  When interpreting the candlestick data you are essentially still making a judgement call that is only as good as your knowledge base, right?
@_date: 2013-10-27 18:29:03
(Just for a laugh) - I read this as "average librarian" and was trying to make the connection, thinking that the dewey decimal system must be intricately intertwined with bitcoin, then I clicked the link and was confused, then embarassed.

Step 3: PROFIT

We accept them through a previous arrangement and offer a 10% discount if paid in BTC.  We compare $ to BTC with mtgox.com. Once a customer places their order, we give them a temporary wallet.  When payment is received we close that wallet and transfer to our base wallet.  We process their order (tax free- we handle it like cash).

not really, and i see thats a mistake now.  Being in a college town I just thought it would be a progressive sort of thing to do.  Im the first to admit my fault, just trying to figure out how to work it from here.
@_date: 2013-08-14 05:45:22
I realize there is nothing implicitly illegal about purchasing the btc so I guess I would not be opposed to coinbase, my concern is if I use them on SR, would they be able to trace that back to me?

The main hang-up with localbitcoins is setting up my online banking to transfer to outside banks.  You are probably right that I should just be patient, set that up, and use banking deposits-  it seems like there are so many ways for a fool to be parted from his money

Do you sell your profits to balance your original investment, or let it ride, essentially adding to the principal investment?
@_date: 2013-10-31 01:40:06
I buy when I see drops in the price or weekly.  I haven't sold yet and do not plan to.  It's really difficult, neigh, impossible to time the market and you will likely end up losing money doing so.  I took 10% of my bitcoins and trade futures on bitfinex, but it turns out, I'm not really very good as a fancy futures trading business man.  Its fun though, keeps me interested in all the data being pumped out, and its an acceptable loss were the market to turn on me entirely.

@_date: 2013-10-21 12:53:31
I guess my concern here is the money I am currently investing is small savings, ebay sales, odd jobs, etc.  The loans I withdrew are an investment into myself, something I feel I have control over, unlike bitcoin.  Dont get me wrong, its a great idea and I would love to put 3k to bitcoin, but Im still new and maybe I dont fully understand what the goals most have for bitcoin.  Or I may just lack the balls necessary.
@_date: 2013-10-21 16:21:34
I'm new, but I dont think coinbase is an exchange; it functions as an online wallet and uses bitstamp for trades.  That being said, bitstamp is a good exchange company based in the US.
edit: like I said I am new haha
