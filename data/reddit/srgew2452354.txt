If any does I'd say it's highly unusual.

It will probably never be cheaper to make two fx transactions (HKD -&gt; BTC -&gt; JPY) than one (HKD -&gt; JPY). Look for a normal currency fx service.. I doubt what you're looking for will ever exist and while it is certainly possible to get corporate accounts with multiple bitcoin exchanges it's so far from being worth the effort for the relatively poor transfer efficiency.

It's vaguely interesting that Gemini is getting well enough known that there are actually people who don't know this using it.

you can only use it for sending USD to another circle customer.. which for most of us is pretty much useless so I'd just withdraw it to your bank account or card and look for a new exchange.

I think your best bet would be to withdraw the cash from an ATM and try maybe libertyx.com cash deposit at a convenience store or else a cash deposit option from a localbitcoins seller.

I thought gemini was just an orderbook exchange? Are they also a broker?

IMO they're mostly a marketing ploy.. get people asking that question.. and also it allowed them to report large volumes in the early days when they had only trivial volume on their actual exchange.

afaik the only way to deposit CAD is a wire transfer to their Japanese bank account. I doubt this is really the best option for you, but maybe they will enable it if you email their support.

quite possibly.. but the names were given by people investigating the mtgox data dumps.. not official and afaik it's possible the bots never existed.
