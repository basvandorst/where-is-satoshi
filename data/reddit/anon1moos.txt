Quick, dump all your coin (so I can buy it at a lower price).

There is definitely such a thing as canned salmon.  If you're actually prepping I'd advise to stay away from fish.  People have gotten mercury poisoning from too much canned tuna, I'd imagine salmon is just as bad.

Step 3 doesn't happen with Bitcoin.
Edit:   for step 3 to happen requires a blockchain fork.  It would have to be a truly  substantial amount and in the interests of the people controlling the currency.  This happened with etherium, which is why there are now two ethers.

because people like to talk about making so much money off crypto that they can buy a lambo.  This one is closer to the truth.

Then you get the price in fiat that however much bitcoin you had at the time was worth in fiat

"tumbling" bitcoin used to be a thing, but it involved paying a launderer, to do very many meaningless transactions.  It was still traceable, just harder to trace.  With fees the way they are now, it's not even feasible to attempt it anymore.

so Tether?
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:38:25
Or you could use Monero, then you don't even have to launder.

nice helmet, must have cashed some out before the crash to afford that piece of sweet gear

If someone had an answer to this they'd be very rich.
@_date: 2019-05-04 15:31:20
Yeah other than that it’s the kind of fees you’d expect from BTC
@_date: 2019-05-04 12:41:11
Low fees and very fast transaction times.  Not sure what the block size is, but it must be absolutely enormous.

What time zone? I’m in.
