Do not become fool by adding BTC to igot.com wallet. never trust any how with this wallet provider.
they keep your BTC with them and use your money for there business 
when you sell them they give good rate but not transfer money early.
even transfer is manual so you can not transfer immediate like blockchain and zebpay.
don't trust on there good rate, commitment and timing, they have no instant chatting option and not responding to your ticket also.
igot.com has a world class poor service.
They make fool to users.    
transfer to other wallet takes max 1 to 2 hour if you are using unocoin.com or zebpay.
if you want to sell or buy btc there are 2 good exchanger i ever use. one is zebpay and second is unocoin.
i have problem which i have transferred to other wallet. it shows in pending from 5 days.
it must automatic and igot make it manual.
they are not responding to ticket. 
i got only one answer for the ticket with commitment of 1 week.
