This is exactly my strategy and it has served me very well so far. I just don’t think about the price.

Worked perfectly! Thanks for posting this.

Perfecto! I'll run a test now with another Redditor to show you what the process will look like in practice.

I guess I'm confused, is the fourth party the arbiter?
If so, my understanding of your question is you have three people involved in the bet, and you want to add the arbiter after you've decided on the bet but before the event has taken place.
Easiest way to do this, would be to have two transactions. You create a multi signature address for just three bettors. Everyone deposits their funds, and the address takes two of the three bettors to spend the money.
Once you guys have decided on the arbiter that you like, you create a multi signature address with all four of you. Since you need there to be a majority of signatures to spend from the account. You give the arbiter two signatures, and require three of five (either all three bettors, or the arbiter and the winner.
**So essentially, you gather the funds in account controlled by the bettors.
Once you pick the arbiter, you create a new account that's controlled by the arbiter and the bettors (giving the arbiter enough signatures that they can authorize a spend with the approval of one of the bettors.)**
Each person sends a transaction to the other bettors, and the arbiter. And it works the same way as you would with two bettors and one arbiter.
Hope that wasn't too confusing.
