He's right though this is what people are piling into Bitcoin cash!!
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:41:00
Yeah I'm shocked people are fudding bitcoin cash it makes 0 SENSE. 
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:49:42
I got in 3x higher and happy ��
@_date: 2017-08-08 18:31:41
What about faster transaction speed?
@_date: 2017-08-31 10:54:07
Same story as me. Instead of mining I wish I just bought at 20. Oops!
@_date: 2017-08-19 23:31:24
Triggered? Why would we care. Jihan was always known as a controlling ass deviating from what most people want in cryptocurrencies. Why side with him now?
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:03:22
I also bought recently, in for the long haul. More people will be catching up at higher prices - meh
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:37:51
Own both faggot
@_date: 2017-08-26 16:47:04
These "good" miners are raping us in fees.
@_date: 2017-08-22 04:58:57
Bitcoin cash is doing ok actually
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:37:03
How is bitcoin cash worthless shit? Just because you sold it does not make it worthless. 
@_date: 2017-08-22 05:11:44
The Bitcoin brand is being destory by core hence the move to Bitcoin cash. I'm a buyer while Bitcoin legacy falls and b cash holds
@_date: 2017-08-17 19:09:09
You've been brainwashed into believing it is an altcoin. It is bitcoin. PERIOD
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:08:47
Still don't understand the hate on bitcoin cash... charts look good also buy low sell high!
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:47:14
This is what that conclusion is based off of
@_date: 2017-08-08 17:26:43
And yet theres still replay attack and a larger blocksize. THose are advancements, no?
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:04:57
In the next three years I honestly think it will be around 25 thousand - 100 thousand per bitcoin

Store of value. Can't be confiscated. You are your own bank. Can transfer large ammounts of cash whenever you want. Finite ammount of coins. Reserve currency for multiple decentralized applications.  Also great for speculation based on all above reasons.

It already dipped and is already consolidating, teather usually is discounted when you sell and more expensive when you buy. You essentially lose money doing both. If you think it's going to drop more then 20% then it is a good idea otherwise it seems like you'll take a 5 % hit to sell and 5% hit to buy back in
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:21:02
Front and back for me as well
@_date: 2017-09-08 14:37:45
They might own short positions. Thing is this is not the stock market and they don't own most of the coins, they will try to steal as much as they can though. That's why we HODL
@_date: 2017-09-04 15:34:57
I doubt anyone will sell for 2k.
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:45:46
The charts are staring right at my face and they are screaming buy. The point is to buy at lows.
@_date: 2017-09-15 16:16:21
I did and so did my friends! Got in at a great price! Hope you did the same : )

Local Bitcoins website has sellers that are snon and deal in cash

The crashes in Bitcoin are a meme at this point. If you've noiced most people will joke about it because Bitcoin is no joke. If that makes sense.most people are used to the dips / crashes. We actually just don't care.
@_date: 2017-09-02 06:03:45
Wait so this was just a prank?!?!?!?
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:17:51
This GUY IS LITERALLY THE ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE
@_date: 2017-07-04 21:49:04
Like I said, I have. Suppose I'm wasting my breath.
@_date: 2017-05-27 10:32:13
But isnt it great that people were introduced. I got in recently and love cryptos
@_date: 2017-07-04 21:49:14
You're right!
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:27:32
Why not just teather to USD and wait to buy back in?
@_date: 2017-06-14 05:41:18
I will bet eth on this fact. Anyone want to make a contract for before 2019?
