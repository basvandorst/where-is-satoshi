So what happens when ether/omg bring out plasma this year which can do 1,000,000 tps? 
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:37:58
And Plasma will too this year. They didn’t just pull LN out of their assess. It’s being developed and you can keep up with the development on Github. As I said the code is open source so go look for yourself. 
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:33:00
If you think Plasma is Vaporware then you’re saying Lightning network is too... you’re not making any sense 
@_date: 2018-01-20 21:57:25
If you look at my initial question it was asking what happens to lightning Network. I didn’t imply ones better than the other, the previous reply to comment was hostile. 
I simply asked what happens, as I weren’t sure and everyone that has replied to my initial comment has been defensive over BTC. I didn’t say OMG/Plasma was better, I simply asked how it would affect LN. Jesus

 No worries man, I’m here to learn more than anything else. I don’t come from a computer science background so understanding the technicals is a struggle hence why I ask questions, to learn. I’m hoping one day to pursue programming and computer science in general but I’m trying to avoid uni for persona reasons so I’m just trying to gather info. 
No harm done, we’re all in the same space on the same boat and I hope everything coexists in the end so we can all reap the rewards

You're going to liquidate your BTC to put it into inflationary infinite printable toilet paper? Wh...never mind. 
Leave BTC in its wallet and use that as a savings account. Anything you NEED then liquidate that amount, other than that, don't touch it man.

No one is mocking anyone, so keep your knickers on. Similar advice has been given to him numerous times in this thread for a reason. 
It's very, very unlikely that it's going to go down. Janet yellens actions will have effect on the debt world. Bonds are built on a country's debt and the cost of servicing that debt will rise when they hike interest rates. Bond holders are old money/big money and if interest rates rise then bonds fall, it's a mechanical process. However if they bail out the bonds where can they chase yield? Bitcoin, so the room for this to go quadruple it's amount is a lot larger than the chance of it collapsing, so before you spread your confused FUD do your homework. 
BTC to infinity and beyond ☄
@_date: 2018-09-05 11:25:38

@_date: 2017-12-12 18:11:48
The fed are going to hike rates and when they do, understand that bonds are built on a country's debt and the cost of servicing that debt will rise when they hike interest rates. Bonds is big money and if interest rates rise then bonds fall. However, if they bail out the bonds where can they chase yield? crypto....more specifically Bitcoin because it has a proven track record and has gone through confidence tests. We are far from a bubble, this is merely the beginning.
@_date: 2018-08-04 15:13:48
I’ve never said Bitcoin is safer so where are you getting these accusations from? The UK is in negative interest rates too so I’m not convinced by your list of countries, I live in the UK. I don’t have faith in Fiat currencies and as for now Bitcoin is in no shape or form to take on the role of being a nations currency. I expect the crash to happen next year, crashes don’t happen on a given day. Interest rates going up is not a good thing and both the fed and BOE have hiked them. I will be shorting, don’t worry. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 13:55:33

@_date: 2018-08-04 14:54:33
Right okay. What you’ve just said is that people should chase yield in equities to counter negative interest rates. Do you not know equities are in a bubble, so if everyone augments to this, you’re only setting more people up to get ruined when markets pivot which is imminent. People are forced to chase yield because of negative interest rates. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:14:24
How is the Dollar stable if it can’t retain its value?
@_date: 2018-08-04 11:59:15
Where in my comment did I argue that BTC should be a USD replacement? Or even make a reference to this chart you’re talking about? Every fiat currency prior to the ones that exists now have gone to 0, that’s a fact. Earnings do not outpace inflation in the long run, we’ve been in negative interest rates for how long now and earnings haven’t budged. The only way you can compensate for the percentage difference between inflation and interest rates is risky investing, which is why we have had low interest rates, to stimulate economical activity. That same incentive has caused the Margin debt to double that of what it was in 2008. Why do you think the equities are a bubble? Because our earnings? No, the markets are no longer a reflection of wealth in our society. The only reason the US hasn’t experienced hyper inflation is because they export their dollars so it’s out of circulation hence why the US import as opposed to export. 
@_date: 2018-08-04 08:26:14
Excessive printing causes hyperinflation, like the guy said above this causes the currency to lose value which would result in them purchasing less and less each time they print. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 18:41:14
Because noncoiners say dumb shit like you’ve just demonstrated 
@_date: 2018-05-24 11:39:15
According to your logic, all you grabbed was a piece of paper. What if someone were to say, I’ll send you a bank transfer of 7000 dollars? Do you see it? No. To say Bitcoin is nothing is just an uneducated statement. 
Personally I would take the deflationary asset which I have complete ownership of and is immune to monetary policy/QE. That 7000 you got will just buy less and less over time, if you then say ‘well, BTC is volatile and sheds thousands a day’ etc, you’re not wrong but, in the grand scheme of things BTC will outperform the dollar indefinitely. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 12:48:25

‘Autonomise some sort of central authority against bad actors’ isn’t vague? Your explanation was poor, bad actors could be people trying to commit fraud (which isn’t possible with blockchain). There are more and have been more scams involving fiat and digitised fiat than crypto. You can’t stop a bad person from doing bad things. Someone can use a rolling pin to bake, or to hit someone. As for losing the private key, that’s why you buy a ledger, have various copies of your passphrase and you do your due diligence, a lot of these scams gloat about making x amount on your investment, if you’re that easily enticed then that’s your fault. You’re being biased on grounds that aren’t even solid.
@_date: 2018-06-04 17:42:41
Technically, if you had 1 coin ‘0’, you still have 1 coin ‘0’ even after the fork. The other coin could be of value but coin ‘0’ is not inflated or deflated, if it is hard capped like Bitcoin. Inflationary j implies that a single unit is worth less over time because more units are created, which in turn lowers the value of the single unit. Bitcoin is a closed system, they can neither be destroyed or created. The deflationary side comes from the possibility of Bitcoins being lost which causes it become scarcer over time (estimated 3 million has already been lost). 
You can compare forking to quantitive easing, they are not the same at all. In fact, bitcoin is immune to monetary policy because of its closed system.

So if I create my own dollar it will cause inflation to the actual dollar? That’s the analogy you’re giving me, your argument is fundamentally wrong because it doesn’t increase the supply. You can not, through cryptographic principles, increase Bitcoins supply. Did Litecoin cause Bitcoin to inflate?

‘Banks are paid to keep customers money safe’ - LOL, you think your funds are safe with the bank?
‘Until Crypto comes up with a way to ‘autonomise’ some sort of central authority that protects against bad actors’ - what do you think POW does, the Bitcoin system of trust is based on computation. Mining nodes validate all transaction in reference to Bitcoins consensus rules. Therefore, mining provides security, rejecting invalid or malformed transactions as well as the double spend problem. That is why the network is transparent, the ledger is available to everyone. 
Sorry, but you’re far behind.

Fiat: an official order given by someone who has power i.e. fiat currency means a currency that is forced into circulation by a government. 
When governments no longer asserted they would exchange paper money for gold as the basis for backing, their currency became fiat currency, its value assigned by fiat or legally binding national asserting, for whatever that is worth. Bitcoin is not governed by a single government, however it is backed by a a proof of work consensus.

News came out about the Catalonians wanting to adopt digital currency. They’re considering an e-residency program similar to the one in Estonia, they’ve even gone as far as sending representatives there. 
If they do come out with an ICO it’ll be interchangeable with Bitcoin. All these coins that are being traded against BTC all help it in terms of price. 
Its becuase its a master ledger for all of these coins, everyone thinks they can make their own ledger and it will be independant..... until they make the  whatthefuckcoin/BTC trading pair. 
But...I don’t think that’s the reason for the price spike, I just think people are getting ready for the fork, the above is something to keep an eye on mid-term (2018 possibly). Everyone migrated to BTC which drives the price up. That’s why some people refer to it as a ‘Pump’ although some would argue that’s not the correct term. Think of someone pumping a balloon, the air being the money they’re putting into BTC (the balloon) and the balloon growing Is the price increasing, all in preparation for Segwit2x where hopefully we will see new highs.
...and ask yourself what would happen if an entire nation was to put themselves on to the blockchain and used bitcoin as their master ledger when they put the entire economy into the digital realm  ��
