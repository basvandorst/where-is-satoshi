I'm not even sure if there is a simple easy solution. However, you could look at something like the total cost of transactions over a period.
@_date: 2018-01-05 07:53:55


Did you not read what I just wrote? No, theoretically how much money is in there is *how much money is there*, i.e. the total net amount of USD that has been moved into exchanges.  There is literally no reason to ever multipleytotal supply times the price of the most recent transaction.  You might as well multiply unicorns times the smallest price of bitcoin on March 3. You'll get just as meaningful information.
It's not "theoretically how much money is there". If and only if every person ever bought in at the current price (or it averages out to the current price) *then and only then* does this match how much money is there.  But if one crazed and very rich investor said, "Y'know what, fuck it. I'm going going to claim every single USD that is currently available to the BTC ecosystem. I'm going to cash out my 6M BTC."  He will get some amount of money. And the amount of money he will get will be *far* below the current market cap.  Not "25% below". Not even 25%. Like 1%, maybe, if that. That is how much money there is.


Yeah, you *could* turn it around talk about the amount of money in the USD system, measured in BTC, but as USD has more universal recognition and less volatility, it's more sensical to talk about it this way.

Section 2:




You aren't going to need 10 payment channels. You'll probably only *need* one.  Presumably I'll have a channel to e.g. coinbase who has a channel to most other major exchanges who then then have channels to their users.  Additionally, users may form multiple channels to whoever else.  So in actually you'll only *need* one channel, and two would be a bit of overkill.  (And if I don't like coinbase I could go through any other major hub that I was so inclined to.)

One of the worst offenders, gdax/coinbase, still hasn't implemented segwit despite the fact that it would save them tons of ɃɃɃ. Why? Because they're already making so much ɃɃɃ from new customers that they can't even count it all.  Who cares about implementing a new technology to save you 1% of your expenses (Assume TX costs are 4%, and segwit would save them 25% of that...), when your income is going up by 30% every month?  It's not worth the risk of rushing to adopt the latest cheapest technology as fast as humanly possible.
Eventually, economic pressure will force them to adopt segwit--but who knows how long it will take.

Depends on the charity. The FSF may very well do so.
But it doesn't really matter because pineapple fund only has 5k BTC total whereas the daily trading volume is 10x that (let alone yearly trading volume).
It also puts BTC in the news which attracts new investors which causes buy pressure.  But then the price rises and that causes sell pressure by people looking to cash out.  It's not as simple as you make it sound.
Go look on any exchange and see what the spread is for 5k BTC and then normalize that to global trading volume to see what kind of immediate effect them dumping *all* their funds on the market would have.  Even that would be far less than a single percent.

There is no such thing as "the price" of a commodity (although we act like there is).  Each buyer/seller has some price they are willing to buy/sell at, and sometimes there are overlaps in this which allow for transactions.

I recently played a video game that had a biased gambling system. A coin lands on heads 75% of the time, tails 25% of the time. But the payment is double or nothing your bid each time.  So you can get very good odds just by always betting heads.  *Even as a professional statistician playing this game, I went broke on my first time*. (I made about 4x my money before eventually ending up with 20% and walking away. My initial strategy was to continually bid 50% of my net worth.)
I broke down and did a bunch of math and it came out that even in the above 75:25 game, it's a losing strategy to bid more than about 50% of your net worth as you will eventually hit a string of losses and lose a large portion of your net worth.  Some simulations told me the optimal bid amount is interestingly to continually bid only roughly 20-30% of your net worth.  Then I adjusted my bidding strategy, bid roughly 20% each time, and then watched my net worth rise towards infinity.
It goes to show that even with a game with the odds **3:1 in your favor**, it's still easy to lose if you don't know exactly what your'e doing or how much to put in at any given point.  Then there are people betting the bitcoin market (odds like 52:48 in your favor) with leverage--you are going to get eaten alive. Unless you know exactly what you're doing (you don't. If you think you do then you *really* don't, and if you've made money and think you do, then you *really absolutely* don't), you will likely both make and then lose a lot of money, just like the guy in the other post.

By amazing happenstance my initial percent to bid was the same as Kelly (50%), despite being unfamiliar with it. (Despite not knowing about Kelly I assumed that something like it must exist and the optimal value was likely somewhere between 25% and 75%, so I just started at 50% which is the same as with Kelly for p=0.75, b=1).
The issue is that Kelly does not A) minimize the expected time to reach a certain goal nor does it B) minimize the risk of losing a significant portion of funds, both of which criteria were more important to me than maximizing expected ROI.

Yeah, the numbers his assessment is based off of are absurd.  You don't need every single person to have 10 payment channels. Do you have 10 ISPs connecting you to the internet?  You don't need to reach the entire network in 6 hops--50 hops is just as good.
If there are 10 billion users, and every user is connected to, on average, 2 other random people, then essentially every single person is connected to every single person (the probability of a given group of 3 people being in a separated micronetwork would be 1 in 10B^3, times 10BC3 groups of 3 people is an insanely small number, the probability of larger micronetworks are even smaller)
But most importantly, the connections are likely not to be entirely random but to follow a loosely disorganized hub-and-spoke model lacking single points of failure, greatly reducing the number of hops necessary.

No, it doesn't, for various reasons.  Most importantly, there is no such thing as "the price" of a commodity, only how much it costs to buy or sell a certain quantity with a certain other person. So if there's an ask for 0.01 BTC @ 15293.21 USD/BTC on an exchange, I can buy that 0.01 BTC at that rate. But what if I want to buy more than 0.01 BTC? Well, then I have to buy out the next asker as well, up until I can buyout enough quantity. Unless the quantity of the minimum ask is smaller than how much I want to buy, then the price is going to be &gt; 15293.21 USD/BTC.  Also, the bids/sells work in the opposite direction, where "price" to buy bitcoin is not a single scalar value, but a mathematical function of how much you want to buy.  If you want to find the total amount of money the system represents, you'd have to find out how much the average price would be if 100% of the supply decided, "Well, time to sell right now!"  The price would plummet to 0.
Now, when dealing with small quantities, this effect is negligible. GDAX usually has only 0.01 USD different between the min ask and max bid prices, and people don't care about 0.01 cent difference for such a small quantity.  But for large quantities, say hundreds or thousands, the effect is *huge*.  Go look on GDAX and see how much you could get if you tried to sell 2k BTC right this moment--Without even looking I guarantee you that it would bring the price down to sub-$10k easily.  (Of course, this would open an arbitrage opportunity and the price would rebound some non-negligible amount, but that's a different story--you can treat the entirety of all exchanges as one giant ecosystem the same as one exchange with no arbitraging.)  The reverse is also true--if you tried to buy 2k BTC, the price would shoot up.  And when dealing with humongous quantities, say, the entire supply of BTC, the price for buying/selling small quantities is *completely meaningless*.
A better way of representing the "total money in the system" would be looking at how much USD has flowed into the ecosystem.  Unfortunately, this is very difficult to tell, but it is A) much much less than the market cap and B) much more accurate reflection of how much money the system represents.
(Disclaimer, yes I know that calling USD money and treating BTC as a commodity is strange because they're both currencies, but all of the principles hold the same way and if you don't, you can't talk about "amount of money in the system" in terms of USD.)

No, I know you don't know what you're talking about because you think a one-time sell of 90 BTC has any sort of effect on the market price when 1800 new bitcoin are minted daily and the daily trading volume is 50k.
Like yeah, it will have some downward sell pressure, but the amount is so incredibly amazingly miniscule that it literally doesn't matter.  It's like the effect of the sun's gravity on how high I can jump.  Yeah, it does have some non-zero effect but it doesn't matter.

This is kind of just shit all around.
Fig. 1: Why is this not in a log graph? I can't see the tails on linear scale. Why does this figure even exist. Also, you could just probably adjust the sigma value and normalize to make them fit perfectly, by my eyesight.


Wikipedia is right in one sense, but leaves out the more important fact that MC methods are just a really fancy way of solving very complicated integrals without having to formally derive the exact integral, let alone compute it, by applying the random sampling method.
But there is no underlying mathematical formula for financial markets. There's no point to doing an MC simulation here because you're just making a complete guess at the underlying structure with no reason for doing so.  A simulation can't take into account the probability of the LN taking off, or some bug in the LN code causing all LN users to lose all funds (woops!).


Generally speaking financial markets are very-close-to-but-not-quite random walks. They tend to have reversion-to-mean characteristics. Thus you have to account for this or all of the output from the simulation is bunk.


Who would have thought that a log scale would have been the scale to choose for something which is cumulation of a large number of multiplications?  Oh wait, everybody because you're an idiot for this not to be your first idea at a glance.  Why is there even a linear graph at all?


You don't need to run a MC simulation to see that. All you need to know is what you programmed the average ROI to be on a given day.


When are you going to learn that if you want to compare data which is geometric in nature, then you should use log plots, and when dealing with data which is arithmetic in nature, you should use linear.  This is like the 3rd time you've fucked up this basic concept.


The most likely outcome of your program, not the *actual* price, that is.




WHY IS THIS NOT IN A LOG GRAPH!
In conclusion, while it's like 90% bullshit, I also agree with his conclusion that bitcoin will likely be somewhere between $13k and $271k. Only instead of adding 800 unnecessary steps of writing a fucking MC simulation of the whole thing, I would have just done a fit on the price in log space over the past years and extrapolated within the goodness of fit of the graph and gotten the exact same answer (within statistical negligibility), only that would have taken 10s instead of having to program an entire fucking MC simulation.

A channel is a special address that requires 2 signatures to spend.
Let's say Alice wants to send Bob 100 mBTC. But she wants to use this newfangled LN.
So Alice makes a 100 mBTC transaction from her wallet to a channel address, signs it, and transmits it to the network, and waits for it to get on chain.
Now she makes a transaction for 100 mBTC to Bob from the channel, but is timelocked so it can only be sent 10 days into the future, and signs it (but it still needs Bob's signature).  She then gives this transaction information to Bob, but doesn't transmit it to the network.  Bob now has a 100 mBTC debt from Alice that he can claim at any time (after 10 days into the future).  Alice gave him this transaction in a flash. Bob doesn't have to wait for confirmations, because he can just wait 10 days and claim the debt later.  He also knows that Alice can't double-spend out of the channel, because it requires his signature, and he's not going to sign off on that.  So this debt is as good as ~~cash~~ on-chain coins to him.
Now, Bob decides he wants to give 10 mBTC to Alice for whatever reason.  He could use a regular on-chain transaction confirmed by the network/chain, but he says, "Hey. I have this debt from Alice. I'll just reduce the debt by 10 mBTC."  So he creates a new special transaction from the multisig address that sends 90 mBTC to him, and 10 mBTC to Alice, that needs to wait 9 days into the future before it can be spent, then signs it, and gives this transaction to Alice, but doesn't transmit it to the network.  Alice says to herself, "Hey. I can send this transaction to the network and put it on the chain before that one. And I have his signature on it, it just needs mine.  As soon as I transmit this to the network, the previous transaction I signed will be invalidated." So she accepts this, knowing it's as good as coins to her.  Again, she doesn't need to wait for any on-chain confirmations for this--just for her to see the signatures and time locks.
Then Alice says, "No, I think I would like to give him those 10mBTC again," and this repeats.
So once the channel has been opened, you can indefinitely* send funds back and forth between the two parties.
Eventually they either create a final transaction with no timelock, and transmit that to the network, or wait for the timelock to end and then transmit it.
Note some important key features: 1) At every point in time, Alice is protected from evil actions of Bob. She can refuse to sign anything he proposes, and always can just wait for the timelock before claiming what she has previously acquiesced. Same thing for Bob.  2) They can interact with each other indefinitely at the speed of their communications and signing/checking.  No slow blockchain except for the initial opening and terminal closing! 
That's great for 2 people, but where LN really shines is that let's say Alice wants to send money to Carol.  If she has a channel with Bob, and so does Carol, it's also possible (but much more complicated), for there to be a similarly trust-less instantaneous transaction of Alice giving Bob a signed future coin transaction *if and only if* Bob simultaneously gives Carol a signed future coin transaction.  Furthermore, this links indefinitely.  So if I open a channel with Starbucks (where I get my daily coffee), and you have a channel with Starbucks, I can send you money through Starbucks.  Or if I have a channel with Starbucks, and David has a channel with Starbucks and another with McDonalds, and you have a channel with McDonalds, we can route through those 4 channels.
So now trustless transactions can be made in communication+signature time (effectively instant) through the network.  No waiting for confirmations. Just one on-chain transaction to open and the final on-chain transaction to close the channel, and then as many as I would like in the meantime to anyone else in the network.
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:57:07


If both parties agree to it, they can create a transaction signed by both of them that disperses the funds as they last agreed to it, with no time lock.


Fees will be whatever they set the mining fee to in that transaction.


The channel can be held open indefinitely and there is no requirement to close it (unless you just really want to close it).  Basically, instead of transacting on chain, people are giving each other cryptographic-backed IOUs to each other--which the other party has the *option* of transmitting to the chain.
But these are cryptographic-backed IOUs--they're just as good as on-chain coins.  There's not actually any need to ever broadcast the closing transaction (unless the other party has broadcast an earlier transaction and you need to then broadcast your copy that is released first).

To intentionally clog the mempool.  Likely so as to win political arguments about how bitcoin needs bigger blocks.  Or they could short bitcoin significantly, increase the fees, and then close the short after the price drops due to increased mempool congestion. Or maybe they're long BCH and short BTC.
Could be a collusion of a mining pool who has calculated that the cost of the spam attack is offset by the increased gains in the form of tx fees.

@_date: 2017-12-07 05:31:41
Yes you can do it. Yes you will profit.  However, most likely, you will profit at most a few cents a day on average, and far less than just holding.
There are fees to move funds around. Withdraw/depositing BTC/USD/GBP/EUR/JPY on exchanges costs money. Sometimes as a percent, sometimes as more.  More importantly, *it takes time*, especially if you're moving fiat between the exchanges.
Now, over the past year, bitcoin is up about 900% in the past year, or about 0.6% per day. That's what you get if you just hold your money tight in bitcoin over a long period of time.  So you if you're going back and forth with fiat, your fiat increase needs to be about that much per day just to break even with the holding strategy.  So, that means you have to be able to move the funds, pay the fees, and on top of all of that, still break 0.6% per day.
Now, moving is not instant. It can take up to several days for a single fiat transfer.  You're losing out on fiat gains in this period.  This means you may need to be able to make 3-4% on a single arbitrage.
But wait, what if you set it up on 2 exchanges, where you have half fiat, half crypto on both exchanges, and then just wait for an arbitrage opportunity, then sell crypto on one and buy crypto on the other, and then later move the money around to even things out again? Well, this is a much better strategy because you are no longer limited by time! The actual moving money around can be done after the fact, but now you are only investing *half* of your money into crypto, and the other half is just sitting there in fiat.  Now you have to make about 1.2% per day just to break even with the holding strategy!
But the biggest problem is this: This is a very simple idea. I've written bots to monitor prices on the exchanges within my country.  Over a period of a week, I never saw an arbitrage opportunity for more than about $2USD/day.  This is, of course, because other people with other bots see the arbitrage opportunities and then work on them the instant a profit is capable. So the second there's a $0.01c arbitrage change, they execute it.  It's very difficult to break even with electricity costs.   And this, of course, is why all the different exchanges always have *about* the same price, but may differ locally within one country because of the time it takes to move money out of that country, but will still generally always be the same.

To "retain" value, they would need value to begin with.
tBTC are worthless tokens.  Currency is valuable because society as a whole accepts that it does.  But society rejects the idea that tBTC have any value.  That's because society accepts that the value of tBTC is the ability to have a network to test stuff on before making changes to mainnet.

@_date: 2017-12-11 08:39:14


No. You haven't. Because you left out one important thing: Time.
Bitcoin has, on average, gone up about 0.7% per day over the past year. At that rate, hodling would give you about $800 profit per coin.  So you've locked in a gain in fiat, but you've lost BTC.
While there is some amount of arbitrage ability, it's not the case that any arbitrage at all allows for making money.
The arbitraging means that the futures market is the price that traders think bitcoin will be in the future.  But bitcoin itself also is, in general, the price that traders think that bitcoin will be in the future.  So they should be the same price, more or less.

You really do not understand basic risk/reward analysis, do you?


Uh, in terms of risk assessment, they actually they are they *exact* same thing.
After the price has gone up to $10k, investor A has two options: He can cash out (realize his profits by turning the interest into actual gains). Or he can cash out followed by re-investing (realize his interest followed by making a new investment of 100% of his initial principle + interest).  Note that the act of doing absolutely nothing while holding is the *exact same as cashing out followed by re-investing*--you still end up with 100% of principle+interest invested, now acting as though you have put it all in as principle on a new investment.
Whether your net worth came from realized gains from labor (i.e. salary) being the result of investing in education/training (i.e. initial investment in time/money), or realized gains from investing (i.e. interest/profit), or paper gains from investing (i.e. interest/profit), *does not matter*.  And any attempt to think it does is just the sunk cost fallacy with a variable plus/minus sign in front. The best moves forward *never* depends upon the moves made up to the present.


Where the money came from or how much you had yesterday or last year *does not matter*.  At most it may have incur some psychological effect upon stupid investors who invest with their feelings and not logical strategies, or make your accountant go crazy based upon different tax rates.

No. That is exponential growth.
This is because users do not grow linearly but exponentially (at least during a certain growth phase. This is because the probability of a person investing in bitcoin is directly proportional to the amount of information they hear about it which is directly proportional to the number of users. Thus dN/dT = kN --&gt; exponential growth).  If indeed it is proportional to the number of users squared (which I call total bullshit on), that's still exponential growth, because the square of an exponential function is linearly proportional to exponential. (exp(x)^2 = exp(2x) which is a linear scaling of exp(x))


Lol. Quadratic is closer to linear than exponential is to quadratic, by a factor of about infinity.

This is an argument against its adoption, not for.
"Bits" is also a quantity of US currency equal to 12.5 cents. (No longer used.)  ("2 bits, 4 bits, 6 bits, a dollar". "Shave and a haircut, 2 bits.")


On a very technical level, satoshis are what count in Bitcoun. I mean this literally, bitcoin is counted in satoshis, with 1 satoshi being an indivisible quantity of bitcoin, and 100M of which equate to 1 bitcoin.  "1 bitcoin"/"100M satoshis" is completely arbitrary. Satoshi could just as easily have made it be 10M or 1M satoshis to be "one bitcoin". Bits, being 1/1M of a bitcoin is *even more* arbitrary.  On a core fundamental level, "satoshi" is the only unit with any clear meaning that is already agreed upon by everyone to mean exactly that amount.
By the time that satoshis become significant quantities of money, the $ symbol will be available.

You don't understand blockchain technology do you? The  key development of blockchain is that it allows *decentralized consensus* in a way that is cryptographically secure.  It's not that it allows for quick money transfer.
As a matter of fact, blockchain is slow and unwieldy.  If you're going to use a centralized blockchain, *there is no point to using blockchain*. Just use a damn excel spreadsheet or a sql database or anything because that's even faster and cheaper to use than blockchain.
Ripple has absolutely no use case beyond they themselves just being a mega-bank with their own currency that other banks buy and sell.  And there's no point for such an organization to use blockchain when they can use traditional databases which are faster and cheaper.

C) The price of bitcoin then goes to $20,000/BTC. Person A now has 100 BTC worth $2,000,000. Person B now has 1 BTC worth $20,000.
D) The price of bitcoin now drops to $18,000. Person A now has 100 BTC  worth $1,800,000. Person B now has 1 BTC worth $18,000.
From C to D, both A and B lose 10% of their investment. Furthermore, not only do they both lose the same percentage, person A is losing *more* money than person B is, in absolute USD.

This right here is exactly why market cap is 100% completely and totally *meaningless*.  Why would you *ever* want to multiply the total supply times the price of the most recent trades?  That's not the total price used to buy all those coins.  That's not the total price you could sell all those coins at.  It's a completely meaningless number.  That's not the total amount of wealth there is.  It's just the current price times the total number of coins--math that idiots do to make themselves feel better.  More reasonable numbers would be the total number of cash spent on each current position, or perhaps the price of buying/selling 10% of the coins in circulation based upon current depth charts.
However, 2 things to point out. One: Similarly a buy-in can also raise it equally high with just as few purchases.  Also, if someone *did* try to sell that many coins for that much, many people would buy them up as hard as they can, and the price almost certainly would not rest at $1k, but come to some equilibrium between $1k and the current price.
Introducing 16k coins into the market would lower the price somewhat.  But also keep in mind that at the current mining rate of 12.5 coins per 10 minutes, that's how many coins are introduced into the market every 9 days.  Obviously the price has not fallen 90% every 9 days.  There are buyers for those people wanting to dump coins at discounted prices!
Also, GDAX is only 6% of global volume. Any massive sells there would lower the price and trigger arbitrage, bringing it down globally and up at GDAX.  Assuming GDAX's depth chart is representative of the global market, you'd need to sell 266,666 coins (~3.2B USD) to instantaneously drop it to that price. (And whether or not it stays there, jumps up after, or falls more, is a different issue.)
You can also account for mined coins by the cost of mining them. It's effectively the same.

Mining nodes only matter for ordering the transactions into an immutable ledger. However, I absolutely guarantee you that if GDAX, poloniex, and 20 other major exchanges are all running non-mining full node version X and your mining node mines a block that is incompatible with their full node validation rules, even if it becomes the longest chain by other SPV miners building on top of it, or those miners using the same validation rules, it doesn't matter because you are going to be in for a sad time when you can't convert your forkcoins for anything of any value and you have to manually go in and tell your miner to start building on the right chain and cry because you don't have the coinbase you thought you did, because your validation rules don't match the validation rules of the people you want to transact with.

Every time you place an order on an exchange, cancel an order on an exchange, place a market buy/sell, etc. on the exchange, that affects the price (generally just a very tiny almost negligible amount unless it's a huge order).  This is by definition of what the price is.

No, but first a PSA:
Cryptographic security is something that is *very* easy to mess up, and unless you're an absolute specialist, you should avoid trying to derive your own cryptographically secure random number generator and should, instead, use other readily available cryptographically secure random number generators, i.e. /dev/random.  There's just no reason to try to solve an extremely difficult problem that's already been solved when you messing it up involves you losing all your money.
That's why, even if I said below, "I do not see any possible attack vectors", you should *still* conclude not to roll your own implementation of an RNG.
However, I did see a number of needlessly added attack vectors:
When you take a picture, that information is immediately written to disk (in your phone, camera, etc.) Then, you probably have to transfer that picture from your phone/camera/etc. to a computer (possibly done over insecure ethernet, broadcasting that information to anyone listening), write it to disk on the computer, and then read the file.  Now, it's *unlikely* (but not cryptographically secure) that somebody will just happen to grab your phone/camera, recover all data off of it, and then throw a sha-256 over every single recovered file therein, and then attempt to steal any bitcoins that use the same private key--but they *could*--the very fact that you have considered this is probably sufficient proof that out there, some hacker has already developed this system for looking for other people's private keys.  They may also do the same for ethernet data.  Or your computer may have some sort of malware on it that does this for all newly generated files.  And even if a hacker *doesn't* do that, *you* could do it to recreate your own keys--and the fact that *you* can do it means that you are vulnerable to a $5 wrench attack.
If you are using an SDD that is even worse--it is, as far as I know, impossible to 100% cleanly scrub data off an SDD or flash memory due to some of their error-checking systems, short of physical destruction of the medium.
Your phone may also have something like photo stream or iCloud where when you take a picture, it uploads that data to some remote server and writes it to their disks, and now you have the same problem as before, but you don't even have access to the disks! How much do you trust that company to not just read every file off of their servers, looking for possible sha-256 seeds for bitcoins?  Are you 100% positive that there are *no* security holes?
As a matter of safety analysis, you've just opened yourself up to a whole bunch of possible attack vectors that you didn't need to.
As a matter of best practice, for any cryptographically secure anything, it should probably never be writing any secret to disk--as a matter of best practice, assume anything that you have ever written to disk is publicly available information.
Cryptography isn't about "hoping other people don't do actions that are low probability". It's about making sure those people *can't* do them.

If I were to show off my massive computing power, I wouldn't do it by putting impossibly cryptic message like "21e800" at the start of a hash.
I'd instead choose to do something more self-rewarding like mine 16777216 blocks of bitcoin and claim my ~4M bitcoins as a cash reward.  (But not all at once--it would have to be more slowly so as to not ramp the difficulty up so fast and also so as not to crash the price.)
And even if I did choose to do something like choose a specific leading hash of characters after the 0 string, I sure as hell wouldn't choose anything as cryptic as "21e800"--it would be something like "000000".

Okay, like, I don't know much about you, but here are a bunch of tips on how to communicate:
1) The reader of your post sees the post title "Someone using AI?"  If they see this, they are going to think you mean AI in general, and not "CandleBoxAI".  Furthermore, they will look at the posted try to see some connection with AI in general, but find none.  The logo for CandleBoxAI is confusing--I thought it was just CandleBoxA at first.
2) MBA coder being appointed CTO and Director of Neural Learning?
Like, All of those words have meaning--but what the hell are you talking about?  The CTO of CandleBoxAI?  And what's an MBA coder? A coder with an MBA? It's just a weird way of phrasing things.
3) PhD joining team?
It's not clear. Are you asking a question? Are PhDs joining their team?"  Are you asking for PhDs to join their team?  Why did you post another comment when the reader is still filled with questions about everything else?


At this point, the reader doesn't even know who "we" are in your "our tools" statement.  Are you affiliated with CandleBoxAI?  More importantly, *what* z axis?
Like, I can read and understand all of your words individually--but nowhere is a cohesive thought formed that the reader can understand. It's like the author is on drugs or something.
Instead of just saying words at random, try to think about the reader's POV, and what kind of thought and information you wish to convey, and then try to show the right pictures and say the right words to convey that information to the reader.

Except that in English we often say "June 3rd", etc., and it makes sense for the order of the numbers on the page match the order of the numbers in our mouths.
YYYY-MM-DD is A) unambiguous (there is no YYYY-DD-MM anywhere, and YYYY is clearly a year and not a month or day, and nobody is expecting a YYYY-DD-MM), and B) puts numerical sorting order the same as temporal sorting order, i.e. if a date A when written in YYYYMMDD format has a higher value, then that date came after, making it easy to put things in the right order time-wise, and C) can be easily extended to YYYY-DD-MM HH:mm:ss.f
The very fact that one country (and let's be honest, the biggest English speaking country with nearly 2/3 of the native speakers) uses MM-DD-YYYY and most (all?) other English speaking countries use DD-MM-YYYY by default means that *neither* should be used in international communication because they frequently generate ambiguous dates because you don't know which format the author was using.  Even an American writing to another American, the reader doesn't know if 1-5-2016 is in Jan. or May.

Because there is no such thing as "the" price of bitcoin, only what person A is willing to trade for it with person B.
Different people exchange on different exchanges. Thus, the price on different exchanges is different.
If there is a difference in price between exchanges, someone can buy on the cheap exchange and sell on the expensive exchange.  As this is very easy to do, people generally will do it whenever it becomes even slightly profitable.  However, there are opportunity costs with moving money around like that (e.g. you have to keep fiat on hand to move from the two exchanges, and can't be all in, getting that sweet investment money. There are withdrawal fees, etc.)  This means that while prices on different exchanges are *close* in value, they are effectively never the *exact same* value.

On the contrary, a 5% difference in current prices is a 5% difference in future gains.
Say you want to invest $10k, and will pull out when the price reaches $100k.  If you buy at $9k, that's $101,111 of gains.  if you buy at $8.5k, that's $107,647 of gains. That's a difference of $6536 dollars!  Would you rather have or not have $6536 dollars? Whether I'm rich later or or, I'd still rather have an additional $6536 than not have it.
That being said, however, even attempting to buy at $8.5k over $9k is trying to play the market.  To brag, I have a PhD in data analysis. I spent 4 months straight before I could find any recognizable patterns in the market, and even then, only 50.01% of the time for very small quantities.  The market is effectively random.  There are effectively no good strategies that beat just buying whatever you can whenever you can and then holding.

A million times this.  All you have to do is look at  and see that BCH rarely if ever produces a block that is larger than the BTC blocksize cap, and that is almost constantly significantly below (6~9%) the BTC blocksize cap.
BCH has low fees because the blocks are nowhere near full. The blocks are nowhere near full *because nobody uses it.*  If they had forked and left the blocksize the same, it would have the exact same fees as it does now.  BCH has solved the scaling problem by making a chain with no users!

Except for when they don't.
A better pattern would be: 100% of the time that bitcoin has dipped, it has recovered back to the previous ATH  (excluding the past few days which has not yet had enough time to recover yet).
Timing the market is incredibly difficult. Nobody has any idea when bitcoin is going to skyrocket, when it's going to crash, when it's going to move sideways, when it's going to slowly rise, when it's going to slowly decline, or anything else.  The only estbalished pattern is that over time, it tends to go slightly up.

This is a hugely overfitted line with lots of meaningless additionals. It looks nice, but statistically speaking, is absolutely meaningless for future predictions.  I presume the author did a linear fit in semi-log space, then added solid bars at given ratios above that fit.
But the problem is that the value of the rainbow bands at a given point in time is dependent upon the value it achieved after that point in time. You're time traveling. It's easy to find the bubbles when you use data after the bubble. It's hard to find bubbles only using data up to the time of determination.  In retrospect, of course it's easy to look at the Nov-13/Mar-14 area and say, "yeah, that's way above the red line", but that's because the red-area for that point in time is using data from that point up through Nov-17.  What if the graph had been made using only data up through the Nov-13/Mar-14 area?
Use a different algorithm that doesn't use future data to predict a bubble.  To make a proper graph, you can't just do a single fit through all data and say, "This is good for indicating bubbles or not".  You have to make `n` fits through `n` data points, with each fit only using data up to that point in time. Only then can you make any statement about past accuracy of the indicator or not.  Even then, all you could say is that "historically it's been a good indicator of being in a bubble or not" and can only pray that it will continue to be a good indicator into the future.  (Hint: Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future performance, it's just the best indicator we have, i.e. still bad.)  (Second hint: Even then, if you purposefully create an algorithm that fits past data, of course it's going to fit the past data because that's what you designed it to do. It would be better to design an algorithm only up through some point t_1 in time, and then look how well it works for a significant span of time between t_1 to t_2.  Only then do you have any ability to say anything about how good of an indicator it is, and even that is dangerously susceptible to biases if you reject algorithms or parameters that don't work over the second time-span, again, because you designed an algorithm to fit that time-span so of course it's going to fit that time-span.)

Look closely at the orderbook data on any exchange. Look at how long any given order is open. It's plain as day to anybody who cares to look that 99.99% of the orders placed are placed by bots. It's harder to prove in regards to trading volume (i.e. executed trades and not placed trades).  Look at the average time that an order of some volume is cancelled and the time another order of the same volume is placed.  Humans cannot make precise adjustments to their orders multiple times per second.  Most of the orders placed/cancelled on any given exchange is done by bots.


If this were true you'd be making 8200x per year, or 552,882,194,787x per every 3 years or approx. 3.7E19 every 5 years.  Seeing as how you do not literally own the entire earth, I'm just going to go ahead and call bullshit on this.  I don't know if you're lying to me or lying to yourself, but you're lying to somebody because those numbers are not possible.  It's not consistent or it's not 2-3% per day.
Or maybe you meant that you were made on average 1% per day measured in fiat over the past year? That's more believable, and it's also what you'd get just by holding.


My criticism wasn't that bots are random dart throwing machines. My criticism was that the claims made by the OP would be equally satisfied by a random dart throwing machine and thus his claims were meaningless.
As a professional statistician, I can say that it is often very difficult to impossible to determine whether or not you are performing better than pure chance to any degree of any statistical certainty.  The OP said, "Predicted the price movement roughly 65% of the time". This is not in any way indicative that their algorithm actually does anything useful, since an algorithm of "always buy. always" would *also* predict the price movement &gt;65% of the time over the time period of 1/2016-12/2016.


I'm not familiar with what software you are running, but if it does actually perform better than market, and is freely available, then eventually enough people will download it to the point that the market effects it causes are so large that it ceases performing above market.  The only way an algorithm can be profitable above market is if it is only used by a small number of people.  This is a law of mathematics and economics, not my opinion.
More importantly, if it actually performs better than market, then what idiot would ever just *give* such a thing away instead of using it for himself or selling it off to someone else and getting stupidly rich?


Power bracelets, auras, and every scam ever designed to extract money from dumb people ever made don't work and have massive followings.  Massive followings don't mean shit because people are not professional statisticians doing full statistical analyses on data.
And even things that have massive followings and *do* work aren't guaranteed to work indefinitely. BitConnect was a great investment until it collapsed.
But if you do have a freely available bot that does perform better than market, I guarantee you that it is only a matter of time until it quits working above market.  But the more likely scenario is that it doesn't work above market, but has gotten lucky in the past and how well it performs above market is not statistically significant, but you have failed to do a full statistical analysis and so you have mistaken luck-based results for consistent results (e.g. mistaking a mix of random variance + survivorship bias for actual results, etc.)

Kind of sort of. It's basically the same effect.  Before you had a transaction (i.e. a list of inputs, outputs, and the witness data) all being sent over the network and stored in blocks. Now with segwit transactions, it's largely the same, except the witness data isn't stored in the blocks.  (SEGregated WITness data.) This means that the amount of blockspace used by a transaction is largely decreased, and you can put more transactions into a block, and those transactions haven't gotten any smaller.  So if you measure in block size terms of "total amount of data corresponding to all of the transactions in a block", then yes, this is a block size increase.  But if you measure block size in actual block size (i.e. how much data is in a block), then no, there's no block size increase.


It isn't that we "should" make block space scarce.  Block space **is** scarce.  And it's not scarce because of the current limit (although that does further limit its scarcity).  It's scarce because computers and networks aren't magic black boxes that can do infinite calculations with and store infinite data--they have finite limits on what how many calculations they can do and how fast data can propagate through a network.  And there is a limit to how much block space you can have before regular typical computers simply can't run the data. (Try syncing a full ethereum node, or try running the latest game on max HD settings on a 4-year old computer.)  And because block space is scarce we should incentivize people to use the optimized solutions.


The development of the various scaling solutions *are* being worked on in parallel.  But ultimately increasing the block size as a means of a scaling solution is like trying to solve the oil crisis by drilling for more oil instead of by making engines more efficient.

That is wrong. Japanese (in general) lacks a plural form and "satoshi" (サトシ)  is "satoshi" (サトシ), regardless of plural/singular.


Not that uncommon.  It's decently common in Japanese names.


Radicals don't mean anything.


Doesn't matter because that's not how kanji works.  The character means either an archaic unit of length approx. 4 km, or can mean "a town/domain/region (esp. a rural one)".


"Non-existent" would be more accurate.  Like, maybe some guy one time in the history of Japan decided to transcribe "satoshi" with that character, but 99.9999% of the time it's going to be read as "sato".  Like, you *can* bend the rules of the Japanese language to allow this to be read as "satoshi", but it's not exactly clear or obvious.


Yeah, it's common in Japanese like "B" is common in English.  But A) we're not speaking Japanese and B) you can use B as a symbol for bitcoin with little-to-no confusion. It's a homophone with "death" in Japanese (死=death/"shi").  It's not a meaningful character in Chinese.  More importantly, why would you ever want to use "shi" for this? That would be like abbreviating "bitcoin" as "N" instead of "B".  Like, it's just retarded.

It's hard to take you or your software project seriously when seeing stuff like eval() in your code applied to user-supplied input.
There is literally 0 reason to ever use eval() except to write security holes into your code. I can only assume that you are either malicious or incompetent. Either way what the hell is wrong with you?
This isn't just negligent. This may even be criminally negligent. How many people have had bitcoin stolen because of your stupid code? How liable are you for their losses?
Like there 800 ways on which you fucked up basic common best practices.
Okay, so you wanted to take an user supplied object.
The first problem is you're fucking up namespaces. Your program and "things users can reference" shouldn't be in the same namespace.  You should have *your* code, with some dictionary-like object say `user_objs`, and all user input goes through a call to that dictionary object so that users can only see what's in the dictionary.
Second off, you used `classBase = eval(data[""] + "." + data[""].title())`. Why the hell would an object have an attribute that is also referenced by its `title()` method?  You know that in python, you can have title() return not the name of a method, but the actual method itself, right?
    class EvenThisIsDumbWhyIsTitleAMethodaAndNotAnAttribute:
        def method1(self):
            return "Method 1 result"
        def return_the_method_not_the_name_of_the_method(self):
            return self.method1
           # return "method1"   # Only an idiot would do it this way. No user should ever have to worry about the internal structure of the class I wrote.
    etidwitamanaa1 = EvenThisIsDumbWhyIsTitleAMethodaAndNotAnAttribute()
    etidwitamanaa1.return_the_method_not_the_name_of_the_method()()  # First () executes return_the_method_not_the_name_of_the_method, returning etidwitamanaa1.method1, second () executes that.
None of this makes sense. Also, why would you ever do this this way, when you could just do `get_attr(data[""], data[""].title())`?  What are you planning on doing if data[""] contains a ` character? Then you are no longer implicity referencing get_attr(), but are instead just running whatever random code data[""] contains!
And without getting into the rest of the code, why is `title` a method, when a title should ostensibly be an attribute!  (Ignore fact that in python methods are also attributes. You know what I mean.)
Like, `eval()` should never ever ever be used, ever. It should be illegal (and it may be given that you expect people to run this code on computers handling data which are themselves real-world currency-equivalent assets).  More importantly, why are you using it for an ugly hack to do what `get_attr()` does?  You are aware that python has a `get_attr()` function, right? Use it.
Finally, and this is getting really nit-picky, but there's literally no reason for the way you wrote it. You shouldn't be concatenating strings by hooking up multiple strings with the `+` operator, and if you were using PyFlakes (or I'm not sure which linter), it should have flagged it as bad programming practice. Like, it can be done, but it's an O(n^(2)) operation where n is the number of concatenated strings, which then mixes up string creation with what's inside the string, and then also demands using objects of string-type only, when what you want is the use "{}.{}".format(data[""], data[""].title()), which as an O(n) operation and will work for all data types.

None of this makes any sense.
If you did indeed "find an exploit that could destroy bitcoin", then bitcoin was never secure in the first place and even if you don't release it, somebody else is destined to eventually find and release it.  Thus bitcoin's value will plummet to zero since it can be destroyed by any old guy who figures out how.

This is bullshit. Professional poker players are different from people who are gambling for fun, or from playing black jack or roulette (games of luck which are always against you).  This is because poker is a skill-based game with strong elements of luck, where the odds can be in your favor if you are more skilled than the other players.
Yes, it is gambling. But more importantly, it's a game of skill, not a game of pure luck.  If you can routinely beat other players and consistently make a profit, it's no longer pure gambling, but a game of calculated risks.

You don't realize that I'm a professional algorithmic trader, do you?


It's either A) pseudo-science (i.e. fancy words like "TA" and "indicators" and "historical data" with lots of fancy numbers, but not using the data in a way that consistently outperforms the market) or B) it works in which case the inventor is 99.999% guaranteed to not be donating his gold-laying hen to the public square.


You could do the same thing by throwing darts at the wall and getting lucky. Unless you *consistently* (not "can generate", but "usually generate", esp. in a way that is statistically meaningful) do that, it doesn't mean anything.  And if you knew what you were doing and were doing so consistently, you would have said so, not "can generate" like someone who got lucky one time.


Lol? Bots are like 99% of the trading volume. It would be more accurate to say that human traders don't affect the market.


Yes, human beings trade 24/7 completely devoid of emotion and with the ability to do complex mathematics and statistical analysis nearly instantly, responding to incoming data instantly and without delay or hesitation.


If the plug-in works, then people will use it to the point that it ceases being profitable.  The only people who will make any money using it are the early-adopters of the algorithm before the market movements caused by the bot's mass use are so strong as to prevent it from working.

Line was [developed in Japan by Koreans]( now a fully owned subsidiary of the Korean conglomerate Naver, but effectively operating almost exclusively in Japan.  The article doesn't say explicitly, but I was under the strong impression that it was developed by ethnic Koreans in Japan, i.e. not Korea-Koreans but what are effectively Japanese of Korean descent.
But that's not really relevant. What's relevant is that it's used by like 99% of people in Japan.

So? What do the laws of mathematics care about the opinions of judges?  Since when do you go to a judge for your questions about statistics?
Judges care about regulation of gambling, not about the laws of statistics, and even if they did care about the laws of statistics, they're not mathematicians so their opinions are worthless on the matter.

Dumbasses. The market is almost completely random.  You don't need pinpoint accuracy to get filthy rich, just 50.001%.


TA is bullshit so you might as well feed it astrologies.


So by "good" you mean "performs worse than a coin-flip"?  Why not just do the opposite of what the AI suggests to make a profit, then?  Or is it because it's exactly the chance of a coin-flip so that even that tactic wouldn't work either?


Uh, get filthy fucking rich?  Also, I can also make an AI that makes the correct calls on crypto market movements even more than 65% of the time throughout 2017. It's called the "buy buy buy buy buy buy buy bot", it just always says buy.


Yes, that one.


There's no point. If it works and you open-source it, everyone's going to use it to the point that it affects the market to the point that it no longer can turn a profit.  You'll make a number of people very rich--your early adopters and not much else.


Why charge for it? Either use it yourself or sell it.  Charging for it just allows others to reverse-engineer it and then sell it to others and/or outperform you with it.


Either you're an idiot or it doesn't fucking work.
If it worked you'd be so rich that you wouldn't need to worry about building some dashboard.

Basically.  But the negative effects of increasing the blocksize (aside from requiring a HF) are unlikely to appear for moderate increases in blocksize (e.g. 2MB, 4MB blocks).
The opposition to e.g. S2X were not based upon technological reasons, but political reasons.
@_date: 2018-02-05 05:18:36
There are 144 blocks in a day. Assuming you're mining for some significant amount of time (e.g. more than 1 month), you're going to end up with a Poisson distribution, e.g. sigma = sqrt(mu), i.e. that the expected deviation about the expected value is the square root of the value, so after 30 days, you can very reliably expect 43.2+-6.57 coinbases.

Why would anyone use シ (or worse, ㋛)?  Like, it's "shi". Obviously you're going to want ㋚ ("sa"), the actual initial of satoshi and not the last letter in it.

"It's going to fall until it quit's falling".  What a very concrete and non-vague prediction that is definitely solid enough to place buy/sell orders with real-life money. Can I try? "It's going to go down, then up a bit, then down, the more up, and more up, then some down."  I absolutely guarantee you that prediction will be true 100% of the time.
Put a number and level of confidence on that claim. Is it going to stop falling at $5-6k? $7.5-8.5k? $1-3?  Is the current price the bottom?


So how many millions of dollars did you make shorting bitcoin last week? And even if you did get it right one time, that doesn't mean anything. You have to be able to consistently perform better statistically better than market average.  How many hundreds of millions of dollars did you make last year?  How many days did you perform better/worse than market?
Also quote from you in thread you linked:


So... all your TA thought that there was also going to be a bull market?


"Generally spot on".  Unless you can do a formal statistical analysis, these words are meaningless. How many days of the past year did you perform better than market?


Or maybe you missed the mark by miles because you're doing reverse science and making excuses for bad predictions as opposed to changing your theory.

Basically it means, "Take this string, and then execute it as though it were code".
In general, there is little-to-no reason to ever use it, even if you know *exactly* what is going to be put into it.  And using it with user-supplied input? You're asking for problems.
And using it with user-supplied input basically means "run whatever code the user wants to run, whether it be 'print "hello world"', or "open %DOCUMENTS%/bitcoin-core/wallet.dat; decode_private_key(); email_to_me();"
It's literally the dumbest fucking thing you can do.  To give an analogy, if coding were like running a bank, then the eval() statement is the equivalent of "just give everyone who walks in the door the combo to the vault so that they can store and take out their funds.  And then also your SSN, your bank records, your personal accounts at other banks with corresponding PIN numbers, and also when and where your 4yo daughter plays by herself and how much ransom she's worth"

I am not a member of the poker community, but a professional statistician, and I accept poker as a game of a combination of skill and luck.  Players who are better at bluffing/reading/calculating odds will, over the long term, tend to do better than players who are not as good at bluffing/reading/calculating odds.
An unskilled player may beat a skilled player in any one game. But out of one thousand games, the skilled player will beat the unskilled player far more than half of the time.  If the skill difference is large enough that you can win more than the rake, then you can consistently (i.e. better than half over a long period) make profit. This is why while one game may be gambling, professionally playing poker is not the same as gambling.
It is not as though you are just betting hundreds of thousands of dollars at the roulette wheel and hoping that it comes up so you can pay your mortgage. It is not particularly different from any other job aside from that there's more variance in your income.

The argument has never been "everyone can't run their own node on anything higher than 1mb".
It is that HFing is not easily done and that a one-time blocksize is nothing more than a stopgap measure before they will eventually need to be increased again.  And again. And again.
And the reason is simple: a linear increase in blocksize yields a linear increase in transaction volume.  If you were to scale bitcoin to visa level transactions per second, *then* it couldn't be run on standard hardware.


Like the past 4 years.
The issue has never been 'Should we increase the blocksize".
The issue has always been, "Which scaling solutions should we implement, and in what order should those be worked on".
Increasing the block size is one scaling solution.
Introducing segwit is another. (Already implemented, but still not as widely adopted as it could be.)
Schnorr signatures is another.
LN is another (and actually the only one of the above that can actually have super-linear reduction in average tx size).
The ultimate issue that small-blockers have is this:  1) It is impossible for bitcoin to scale easily just by increasing blocksize while maintaining decentralized mining. Centralized mining is a deal-breaker, so you need a plan that goes beyond just increasing blocksize.  (Note: This is not "don't increase the blocksize", only that that is insufficient!)
2) Most of the proposed scaling solutions are *optional*, and in general, at least somewhat more complicated than just not using them.  If fees are 0, users are not incentivized to actually use the scaling solutions.  i.e. they are not incentivized to treat block space as a scarce resource (which it is). Tragedy of the commons applies and users are inefficient with the block space.  (Even a few weeks ago, with the high fees, coinbase transactions were whatever percent of the total block space, and they were eating millions of dollars in fees, and even *then* they still have not yet implemented segwit which would directly save them a ton of money. If they don't do it while they're being economically incentivized, you think they'd do it when fees are near zero?)
3) As a consequence of 1 and 2 above, if you work on blocksize increases first, then nobody will ever bother to use the other scaling solutions.  Eventually, as usage increases, the new bigger blocks get fuller and fuller, and you're going to have to either A) increase it again, or B) implement those other scaling solutions.
All arguments that are valid for increasing the block size *now* will also be valid if you increase them now and come up to the limit again.  So if we as a community HF off a block size increase now, we'll probably do it again next time. And the next. And the next.  It's just a cycle of blocksize increases and eventually you run into the case where typical users can't be their own node, and then you have to trust others to be nodes, and at that point, what's the point of bitcoin since node-runners are just the new banks and it's no longer truly peer-to-peer.  There are also other issues with large blocks such as network propagation.
So the general plan most small-blockers support is to A) *first* work on improving efficient use of the blockchain space and *after* users use the blockchain space efficiently, to *then* increase the blocksize.
Another argument against the blocksize increase is that it requires a HF which for various reasons is risky.

Sorry, I may have overspoken about TA, but I can state a few facts:
1) Every single type of TA that I have ever seen has been bullshit--just tea-leaves with numbers on top of candle-charts.  TA posts that I see are generally accurate... exactly 50% of the time.  (I haven't done a formal analysis so take this number very liberally.)
2) If you personally knew of any type of TA that was better than just random guessing, then you would be leveraging your bets based on them, and you would be filthy rich.  (And you may very well do this, but I doubt most TA advocates are filthy rich--instead I find it more likely that they are trying to convince themselves that their methods work.)
3) I have never once seen a formal statistical analysis of any type of TA or indicator indicating the ability to perform better than market at a statistically meaningful level.
However, ultimately, the ultimate 2 issues I have with TA are the same as with publicly available bots--1) if it actually worked, someone would be using it and *sure as shit not telling anybody their secret on how to get filthy rich because that would just breed competition and cut into their profits*. 2) If it's simple and actually works, then everyone would have already figured it out and be trading off of it to the point that they affect the market price that the algorithm no longer works.  This in turn creates a negative feedback loop in which the best guess for the future price of the commodity is always the current price of the commodity.
Now, if it's some professional statistician who worked hard on some algorithm for a long-time and then decides to sell that proprietary algorithm to a major bank or use it himself, then yeah, that may be well and fine, but he wouldn't be on telling me how to do it for free because that would just cut into his profits.  It's going to be proprietary.

This would make sense *if* he was consistent and said "Bitcoin Core" and "Bitcoin Cash", but he doesn't. He calls the HF "Bitcoin" and the original chain "Bitcoin Core".
This would be analagous to if I one day just starting print vU5-dollars, and claim them as "The real dollars", and then started qualifying US Dollars and Canadian Dollars as "Dollars (US)" and "Dollars(CAN)" and just "Dollars" for vU5-dollars.
It's insane.
