If cryptocurrency mining is based off computational power, what do you think is going to happen now that we have quantum computer chips?*  If my prediction is correct. The whole world is about to change. Very, very quickly. Today there are 3 million daily users of cryptocurrencies, a number that is expected to exceed 200 million by 2025. The demand for cryptocurrencies exists now and will grow at an annual CAGR (or compound annual growth rate) of ~70% for the foreseeable future.

Bitcoin is just like any other commodity... In ways... The more people use it the more its worth. In a nutshell, if people panic sell when there's a huge drop it naturally starts a chain reaction. But 10 years from now... Will Bitcoin remain crypto god? Nobody really knows. Me? I've dumped my spare change in crypto since I heard about it in 2014 at $281. I'm buying the dip... Again... Idgaf. BUY ALL THE DIPS.

If you're looking to spend it, there's an intermediary service that's really good. Tried and True. I recorded my order process as well if you'd like to see it, and it got here in about a day from amazon. Let me know, not sure if I can post it here.

He's right every single atomic swap needs to be reported.
HODL* for more than 12 months. This makes your gains (or losses) long-term capital gains (or losses). This is HUGE. Most people will pay only 0% - 15% in taxes on long term gains (20% if your income is greater than $418,401 as a single person). This compares to the ordinary tax rate (up to 39.6% for 2017) on a short term capital gains (when you HODL’d a certain buy for less than 12 months).
Consider a self-directed Roth IRA. Your gains could, potentially, be tax free! Make sure to consult with a qualified tax professional before choosing this strategy as there are several factors that must be considered.
Consider a charitable contribution using cryptocurrency. You can donate up to 30% of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGO) and deduct every penny of the fair market value at the time the donation was made. You may need a qualified appraisal.
Unless you are mining, do NOT try and put your trades into an LLC. You will likely end up having to pay self employment tax in addition to income tax. If you are mining, consult a tax professional for your specific scenario.
Keep good records. You need to track every transaction (and know your basis). All transactions are required to be reported by the IRS. Even if you use crypto to buy a cup of coffee.
