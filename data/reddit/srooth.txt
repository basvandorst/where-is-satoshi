You can't just mash your keyboard, add some exponents, and declare that you've proved something.     
What grade are you in? Consider talking to your math teacher about randomness. It's an interesting concept!

Put your money where your mouth is. Go buy some dogecoin lol

You sound like a well intentioned person. Rather than shoot blindly into the vast cyberspace, why don't you donate to your local foodbank?    
Eating also makes people happier, and I reckon that the people most in need of happiness are the hungry people, not the people with bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:25:34
Money would be the least of our concerns.    
If humanity and a copy of the blockchain survive, and power was restored to the grid, then bitcoin could be picked up where it was left.    
There would be a period of trouble while the network hashrate came online, opportunities for 51% attacks, double spends...    
But seriously, we would be back in the stoneage fast. Food would be the new currency

is that better or worse than my initial, casual evaluation? I don't have the time to care
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:37:16
Pffft. You shoot down any comment by accusing the poster of negativity because you consider your opinion to be the most worthy?
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:08:46
right. bfl has better quality, but they are so so awful about promising delivery dates. I would never recommend either company.

Also, are you running the latest firmware 0.7.6? I manage my farm remotely, and i have NEVER had to physically unplug any of my units. You can try rollingback to 0.6.48/0.6.32 and then rolling forward to 7.6. Once you're running 0.7.6 you can also try system restarts from the configuration tab.    
I've fixed entirely dead rigs, dead CTAs, and dead cores, all remotely....    
    
They do need nearly daily restarts. I've automated it. I'm considering liquid proing them in a few months when the difficulty is higher

What do you want to do? Are you trying to acquire btc?    
Too bad you guys don't have coinbase :(    
I use btc-e. They support fiat deposit and withdrawal, though I only use them for crypto-&gt; crypto. I recommend them
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:43:36
That's incorrect. I've purchased btc with a credit card at coinbase
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:45:40
Difficulty adjusts every 2016 blocks. Unless all of the previous hashrate came back online simultaneously, the first batch before a difficulty adjustment would take a looooooooooooooooooong time!?    
I hadn't thought about this, and i agree that it's interesting. Good point
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:37:29
Ok, well, take a few breathes. Are you using cocaine? Or fasting or something?    
You are not thinking rationally. If you want to help, help those that are physically around you.    
You aren't going to develop a revolutionary pilot program that solves all unhappiness.    
What's your big picture ideal? Have you thought about it? Do you think it's possible for everyone to be happy?
@_date: 2014-07-02 13:06:24
Limited to $1000usd/day
@_date: 2014-07-06 17:29:35
You're a liar. who are you and what is your agenda? the NSA? or an ignorant dogetard?
@_date: 2014-07-02 12:55:45
Verified coinbase users can buy btc with credid cards
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:54:29
You're posting on the bitcoin subreddit.    
You're offering to pay $30(usd?) for two people to message you three times a day, only with good news, "with some flexibility".    
    
Fuck off. Find another place to manipulate people with promises of rewards
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:18:57
Whoa, an internet coward. First time I've ever met one online    
Delete your dishonesty. There may be no digital record, but you'll always know
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:02:58
You are spreading  misinformation. Random is random. What you propose is not random.
And, how cumbersome is a coin??    
Please lurk for a bit before you start posting. Shibes are welcome here, but this is a serious place.
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:25:51
you again? sigh
@_date: 2014-07-02 11:07:08
What if BTC were directly tied to watts or BTUs? Especially intriguing as we move away from fossil fuels and towards other forms of energy...    
I mean, it basically already is, since much of the value comes from the underlying network, and mining is essentially converting kWh to btc    
   
Edit: how awesome would it be if we eventually thought of energy units as transferable currency, like: "I'll trade you 10kWh for that loaf of bread!"
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:58:32
Sorry :(    
I've had two of my single sc psus go.    
Consider yourself lucky not to have a few racks full of cointerra rigs. Worse than bfl.
@_date: 2014-07-02 17:46:12
I'm going to doublecheck later, but i'm pretty sure it's per day...it may vary by account? I'm a longtime, heavy user
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:02:19
u/usrn = u/rsmoz. are you in cointel?
@_date: 2014-07-01 14:12:58
There is only random or not. Perfectly random is redundant. As started above, your method is susceptible to  statistical analysis in order to *drastically* reduce the search space for a brute force attack.   
How about this? Try your way, and see of your coins are stolen! Report back.    
In the meantime, do our community a service and stop spreading ~~bad~~ unproven advice.
You are posting as u/shibalicious.... :p
@_date: 2014-07-02 11:34:16
You are not entitled to receive tips. Bitcoin tips are not like tips for waitstaff, rather, they are like 
virtual applause.    
We also don't like begging, try the dogetards at r/dogecoin. They don't mind throwing away their worthless monopoly money lol ;p
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:15:32
those of us who know cryptocurrency is a disruptive tech can't convince those who don't. We have to *show* them
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:35:33
Uh, if something is *unexpectedly* moving from anybodies cold wallet then it's the crypto-apocalypse.    
If you' are obsessively checking the balance in your cold wallet, then you either:     
1) are hopelessly obsessive    
*or*    
2) don't understand cryptography
@_date: 2014-07-06 15:57:34
I can't speak for everyone, but I don't care.
@_date: 2014-07-06 16:00:25
Nice! If you have extra cpu cycles on your vps consider mining a cpu friendly alt. Or, do what i do on mine: try finding the private keys for large wallets :)
