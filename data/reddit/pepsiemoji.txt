i believe they mean this:
1. X medicine normal price is $500 outside US
2. US gov pays $5000 for your X medicine from US company
3. I didn't really get $5000 of help. More like $500 and the rest helped some pharma CEO :)
4. Now i'm already out of $5000 on my government allowance, even though I kinda really only got to use $500 worth
Now I'm not american, so ignore me, but i think that's what they meant.

Still a bit confused. So this WON'T just work for the Average Joe, they will have to take steps to join a lightning network provider? 
But I imagine if someone uses a phone wallet app, the app creators would do this, and the Joe doesn't have to take any steps?

Someone clarify, will the Lightning upgrade bring fees to cents to make these business decisions make sense again?

Told a friend a month ago there's a 90% chance he'll at least double his money by investing into this. Spent an hour explaining it to him.
He said "oh if i knew it was a sure thing i'd do it". Oh ok then, wait for your fairytale, bye.

This makes more sense than anything suggested. Just change the decimal point and multiply accordingly.

Unfortunately, the gentleman in this picture has died shortly after this photo was taken. A small gust of wind found its way through the room and broke his neck. You may send flowers to this address:   3PqzS5jLb1e3RGZUxm63NpxWC1jFMhyZW5
