It’s funny how all these so-called hacks happen when it seems people are trying to Drive the market back down.  Just needed one last push to get back into the 6000 range so the big boys can buy back again Before popping it back up. Rinse/repeat

9600 for me

What are your predictions in the next 24 hrs... More likely to go back up to 10k or down to 8.5k? 
@_date: 2018-03-06 01:29:26
Now would be a good buying opportunity...

What makes you so sure it goes up to 9900 instead of down to 7500?

BTC is still very cheap at 7100.  I think this thing will jump very soon.

I believe someone dumped a large stack at once
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:58:35
I did the same

G20 could send this to hell. Your estimates dont seem too unreasonable imo

Now the uncertainty is when will he dump the rest of them....
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:21:05
This will bounce between 8400-9000 all day imo
@_date: 2018-03-10 19:01:29
Set a buy order at 8400 and go enjoy your weekend...

Every time I tether up, it jumps 200 and I have to buy back in higher!

This Mt Gox douche is attacking, throwing all sorts of grenades at bitcoin.  Probable sitting at his desk having a blast....
