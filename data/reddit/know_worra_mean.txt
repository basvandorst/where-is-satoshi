Not sure what you mean by make them a wallet and send them it via email? Wouldn't they need private keys to use the wallet? It's a bad idea to email those, right?

I downloaded electrum, been lurking here a while but I still don't really get it and dont have any coins as yet
I'm really interested in the decentralized autonomous economy side of things, but not very clued on technical side. Also how do I put a tip in a wallet?

I thought he was talking about fractions of bytes (as in mega bytes, not biting like to eat lol maybe they should think about changing that)

So if bitcoin allows us to see permanent records of transactions, which I hear a lot, has anyone, you know, had a look at them?
@_date: 2014-11-03 17:22:56
So its kind of like tax? how do you know how much tax to add when making a transfer?

I thought your first post was right about this isn't necessarily an endorsement and he's done this for his own reasons. But its still significant for bitcoin

Great, will check out mycelium then, thanks!

Why not give them to people who can't afford them?
@_date: 2014-11-03 23:18:28
Ahhh, sorry I misunderstood. Now I get it, thanks for taking the time to explain. So its like having an in gateway specific to that person, for organisation purposes, but it doesn't rly matter who sees it since all you can do with it is put bitcoins in it
@_date: 2014-11-03 14:47:59
Thanks. So who declares what transaction fees will be? The exchange provider? In this case, a cloud based wallet storage?

Okay, I have been lurking here for over a year and am massively interested in the decentralized economic ecosystem potential of bitcoin (I'm a poor layman so don't get too excited)
But I have not yet dove in and uses bitcoins because I still don't understand. I went into electrum, I think I made a wallet? Now what, share my public address? How do I buy coins? Once I've bought them how do I put them in my wallet? Once they're in my wallet are they safe? How do I spend them!
Every guide I read, I get this effect where someone tells you something and it kinda makes sense and then you go to do it yourself and only then do you realise you didn't really understand
Let's say I know a few grass roots groups, how would they go about accepting bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-11-03 13:44:49
Total noob here. I have electrum but not yet used bitcoin. What is bitcoin wallet 4.0? Is it a client? Do I need to download it? What

Anyone ever hear of the Positive Money organisation?  a primarily UK based group, but the ideas apply globally for me. I think they talk sense with regard to our financial institutions and the way they function. It's interesting the quote above because to me it sounds like what it's asking for is a self-regulating money creation system, and to my mind cryptocurrencies are perhaps a prototype of this system?
@_date: 2014-02-26 20:29:42
not really. In the sense of market share perhaps but the idea that if gmail failed email would be over is like saying cars would be over if BP fold. It's like saying television will die if fox does. That people will stop playing games if Sega stop making consoles. The end of drinking if coke etc etc

Obama isn't in charge, in that sense its valid

Thanks a lot! Gonna try out mycelium for android
The reason I started with desktop is because I'm wary of the cloud storage nature coz I don't understand the tech yet so I wanted to get whatever I buy offline while I learn what to do with it, but I'm still not sure of the process with this either

I think this post speaks perfectly to me. I understand the potential of bitcoin but I don't have any, partly because I'm confused as how to participate or where to start and partly because I have very little disposable income.
Do you have any advice?
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:02:08
I think you're right that it is a very big deal. There needs to be more development on how projects can be bitcoin funded, this would potentially create jobs and enable low income earners to enter the market, although until more services and goods can be bought with bitcoin this wouldn't make sense because the bitcoins would only be exchanged immediately by low earners for money they can spend everywhere. I suppose both of these facts are dependent with each other and will grow simultaneously

Thanks for the reply and the info.
Is there a way other than mining, to earn bitcoins? Is bitcoin going to become another expression of haves vs have nots economy? 
@_date: 2013-11-03 16:25:01
I agree with your beliefs on what bitcoin has potential to be, and that's why I'm interested in bitcoin and follow this sub even though I don't have any. But for me it raises the question will it be a democracy for the haves, where you buy your way in, and thus buy your amount of influence?
