Do these wallets plan to support other coins in the future? I hold a lot of other coins and not much BTC now a days. Would this be worth it for me?

What happens if this device fails for whatever reason? Is there anyway to get the coins back?

What's the benefit of running a node? Do you receive bitcoin from this?

Thank you! Do they have any timeline on what they're currently working on supporting?

From everything I read online. The worst thing I can do it openly bring up I was selling Bitcoin. If I'm asked about Bitcoin I will obviously tell them about it but I really don't want to be the one telling them if I don't have to.

Do you have any experience dealing with this? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 17:03:23
I'm going to be calling them again today. I know the word "Bitcoin" doesn't sit well with banks so I've been trying to think of how I can word this without using the word.
I know I only have one shot with this and don't want to blow it by saying something I shouldn't.

I'm not shy about calling them. I'd just like to have a game plan before going in

Using a phone wallet is probably one of the worst things you can do.

Considering I'm 21 I don't make that much. But getting 8000% gains is 9 months is no joke for anyone. I also have 50% of my capital in 50-65% off presales :) please buy the up and coming ICO's ;)

Does anyone know if a Canadian coinbase account can buy from Gdax?

My parents laughed at me when I told them I started investing in crypto. Now I've made 10 years worth of my salary in 9 months and they've bought in.
