You are thick.

Only 21 million coins are possible.  That's due to the algorithm.  Unlike gold, for example, which is scarce because of how difficult it is to manufacture gold atoms.

That's probably because you talk about it all the time around him.  Not really that interesting of a post.

Again, Google probably wouldn't use mt.gox as an authority for bitcoin price.  If I were an amateur developer and needed bticoin price for informational purposes, despite mt.gox being a little unreliable, using their service would probably be the easiest solution.

The dollar is backed by the US Treasury which has historically been the  safest way to invest money (through bonds.)  Bonds give dollars value, as bonds are paid for in dollars.  So the value of the US dollar is that it can be used to purchase bonds from the US Treasury.  And the value there is guaranteed repayment and appreciation from the state.
Bitcoin is more like a commodity than a currency.  It's scarce because of how it's designed.  I'm arguing that it's a worthless commodity beyond the current level of hype that surrounds it.

This makes bitcoin a valuable medium to transfer money, but does not make it valuable as an asset.  Just like how it might be valuable for two people to use Western Union but it might not be valuable to own a share Western Union.
Edit:  Also, bitcoin's volatility in value *does* add some serious complication as a means to transfer money; what if your friend doesn't cash out his bitcoin right away?  It could be worthless the next day.  If he has a mechanism to automatically cash it out, again this is going through banks, and doesn't get around the issue you bring up.

How often could they change "getAskPrice?"
And you could just crawl the website.
Of course, that isn't what Google would do, but still it's pretty easy.

This is a joke right?
What if everyone did this?  Then everyone would have 300,000 dollars.  Then 300,000 dollars would be worth $100.  
But if a few people did this, they would be holding on to an asset that's worth $300,000 against my $100.  But why?  Why should I be willing to trade for that?
This isn't complicated, it's economics.  I'm contending that bitcoin is speculation, NOT an asset that has real worth.  I think once people realize this, the worth will crumble.  Until then we're gambling on how long it will take people to realize that there's no underlying value.
Your argument is, "You don't understand it, so you don't know the value."  I actually do understand bitcoin to some extent.  Even if I didn't, it's not wise to gamble on something you don't understand.
