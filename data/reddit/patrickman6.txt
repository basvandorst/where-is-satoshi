If you look at the site itself we go into detail about all of this. We are not a scam by any means. I would even love for you to try out our service.

I would indeed say that bitcoin or any crypto has achieved as much as it can achieve. 
At its peak only 5% of the world owned crypto

Using crypto as a payment processing tool is one of the best uses for it. We plan to include all large marketcap coins that have our customers best interest. (Low fees, reason to hodl, and real use cases other than speculation)

We are vastly different and far more user friendly. We are launching in about a month. If you subtractive or sign up we will keep everyone updated on the process and features we are adding. 
Their goal is to decentralize trade. Good luck trusting anyone. 
We want to make trade free and more intuitive by bridging the gap between cryptocurrency and physical items.

We are adding other cryptocurrency as we go. In terms a decentralized backbone to build on ETH is just the easier option. Adding bitcoin is one of the first features we plan on adding once our mvp is out and the marketplace goes live.

Fair enough

We are doing it to build a better marketplace and help people sell things online for free. Cryptocurrency is what’s making this possible. It’s more than just a buzz word.

Why is that a bad thing? It’s great for the escrow process so no one losses the usd equivalent.
