Wait what?
I'm about to do a cex.io verification in the coming days. 
Let me get this correctly, you can't withdraw bitcoin to other wallets? Does it just happened to you or does everybody can't withdraw btc to their wallets?
The only reason I want to use them is credit card reward, and if I can't send btc to other wallets, that'd suck big time.

I really do want to learn both sides of POV. I think it's high time for me to understand BTC properly, at least superficially on the technical level, so that I can make informed decisions on what's the timeline (or if) a degree of adoption can happen.

I just want to say I learned a lot from this post.

Oh wow. I don't think I'll check out Rasberry Pi for the foreseeable future, but thank you for telling me about it.
I will mainly for now learning more about the BTC side of things.
I want, no, need, I need to come to my own conclusion where Bitcoin will go as far as adoption goes because I believe adoption is needed for the next moon mission.

Thank you for the answer! I just read it, and will re-read it again later on to better understand them.

I have something to add to your ELI5 of the statechain.
1) What's the difference between Lightning, Statechain, and Federated Sidechains?
2) Why is Statechain needed on top or beside of Lightning?
I'm still reading and re-reading your FAQ, and as someone trying to understand how BTC actually operates, that's two FAQ that came to my mind that isn't immediately clear from your FAQ.
Also, I myself am curious about the "keep it simple end result" of state chain for when/if mass adoption comes.
Let's say BTC reaches mass adoption and I'm an average coin user. Maybe because using BTC means I get a discount from the merchant or something.
How will statechain works from my wallet to send payment?
Does it work on it's own in the background without me knowing anything? Like painless for me.
Or within the future BTC payment app, I need to choose between Lightning, Statechain, or On-chain?

I don't even understand your comments without reading it 3-4 times, I think Raspberry Pi is beyond me, lol.


Is this a CPU problem or an internet speed problem? Let's say 1mb vs. Cash 32mb. Will I, as a home user, goes out of sync because I have factually slow internet speed, or will I go out of sync because I only have let's say an i3?

May I ask whether you have recommended reading materials on the internet where somebody very little to no knowledge of bitcoin scaling debate, able to learn more about it?
I really want to understand, at least in an ELI18 way, why people are supporting keeping the block low, and why other people are supporting increasing the block.
I understand the BCH side, because the argument they propose is easy to understand in layman's term and because they have a central promoter like Ver.
I really want to understand the BTC side to come to my own conclusion of it.

I'm not. I really don't. 
At this point in time I have a layman's opinion that for BTC to rise in value, ass adoption to some degree need to be reached.
This is why I want to learn more about the scaling debate.
Even if blockchain tech is widely adopted in the future, BTC itself needs to reach mass adoption to some small degree.
I feel like the crypto valuation is very fragile when I saw what happened when BCH faction split. BTC halved from $6000 to $3000 around the same time BCH faction have an internal strife. I'm speaking in generalities and I know the timeline is not exact, but the BTC halving in price is around the same couple months that the BCH split was happening. 
That, on top of how not user-friendly using BTC currently is, makes me want to learn more on BTC obstacles to better understand how far are we to a degree of adoption. 
The one chance BCH had to overthrown BTC was back on December, but it couldn't sustain the rally from $1k to $4k.
Then when the BCH internal split was happening, I feel like that was the endpoint of BCH chance to ever reach a degree of adoption, at least that is my current opinion of it, subject to change. 
Brand name matters, and splitting from "Bitcoin Cash ABC and Bitcoin Cash Satoshi Vision" is just unnecessarily complicated for the average person.
I saw the past year bear market and Lightning is still in development and every once in a while, there are things that bring up the scaling debate again, this time like this Veriblock thing.
So that's why I really want to know, and that's where I currently am right now on BTC.

There are some things that I'm still unclear on your post.
May I ask a few questions to better understand them?
So if the block size increases to a comparatively big number, let's say 512 mb, home users can't run full node because the sync time will be really long?
What is the internet speed you have in mind on that current time 6 hours sync? Because my internet is real slow so I want to know how long it is for someone with my internet speed.
If I decide to run a btc full node to do my part to support the network, when I turn my pc off, does the sync starts from the beginning or just from the off time? Let's say a week of off time. How long does a week off time, or a month off time, would take to sync? Like, 15 minutes / 1 hour respectively?
Also lastly, that 220 size of data, if I run full node, I need to have 220 gb of free space on my HDD?

I'm willing to study them in my free time, just to be sure, is the name of the 2 books are 
"Forex Price Action Scalping: an in-depth look into the field of professional scalping" 
and "Understanding Price Action: practical analysis of the 5-minute time frame"?
May I ask the name of the forum (PM is fine too if you don't want to write it out publicly). Thank you in advance!

I'm confused about Whalepool, even after visiting it's website. May I ask what it is? So it's a Telegram group, but it's not paid and it has 24/7 youtube livestream...?

May I ask when people say Moving Average, like your 200, do people usually refers to EMA or MA?
