This is a genuine concern and I will address it as a Dominican. Dominica is very religious to the point of fanaticism and as much as I abhor this behavior their acceptance of homosexuality is regrettably the result of years of religious inbreeding. As an American I would say if you are thin skinned then skip the island because its not worth the hassle but know for a fact not everyone is like that and there are people fighting for a change.

Fair enough, I will certainly be keeping a close eye on this.

No doubt, There are movements though which could see that change. The young people are returning home with much more worldly views and as a whole are much more accepting. Change is coming and the older folks are just going to have to accept it.

How about those gun stats ?
@_date: 2014-08-28 23:53:07
Go ahead, I would be very happy to see the gun violence stat.

I would like some feedback on this, I grew up on this island and personally I am worried about this. Should I be ?

So 22.1 murders a year...which would make it one of the lowest murder rates in the world. Also feel free to point out a single country in the world that does not have a problem with drugs..I'll wait.

I doubt any place outside of the middle east could be as bad as Jamaica (sorry if I have offended any Jamaicans). Public displays of affection in Dominica would get you some nasty looks and maybe some ignorant comments, In Jamaica you would fear for your life.

Best of luck in your future endeavors man (y)

I am happy to hear you loved the island.  Dominicans are not a trusting bunch so this will be slow and tedious but I hope as its prevalence grows it could lead to a more entrepreneurial culture among young folks on the island.

I wish you the absolute best of luck in your venture, I have my own intentions of returning to the island one day and I would like for there to be a real bitcoin accepting culture but it is not likely given the instability of the market both with bitcoins and Dominica.

1 bitcoin could probably buy your drinks for the week/month depending on how much you drink.

Spend at local shops ? Which local retailers exactly are going to accept bitcoins ? We are talking about a nation of 70k people of which less than 2000 own credit cards. I welcome the stimulus don't get me wrong but I don't want my people getting taken advantage of, Most of these folks don't even trust credit cards enough to type in their information on the internet.
These are people who have been taken advantage of before by their own government. We do not trust easily.

Actually I feel I should ask you the question that most Dominicans really want to ask...Is this sponsored or in any way endorsed by the sitting government and will they profit from it ?
