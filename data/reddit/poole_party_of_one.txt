First step is getting a btc ad network... second step is allowing browsers to outbid advertisers to not show ads.  Who is willing to pay more???

It is currently using the 21.co network which already has 2 options for compressing payment fees: 
* 21.co Buffer - Offchain payments with 21 as a trusted 3rd party
* Payment Channels - An early implementation of payment channels between parties.
Once the lightning network is available, you wouldn't necessarily need to work within the 21 platform which would be nice and open.
@_date: 2016-08-18 20:19:07
Right.  This is an open question if micropayments can replace ads.  Would people be willing to pay to not show ads?  Also, there are some use cases where content producers are blocking you from viewing content if you have an ad blocker enabled.

I honestly didn't know about the $10k guarantee.  If I had, that would have removed some of the stress.  Also, I think the platform and support for the site are fine and never had any issues (contacted support one time and they got right back to me).  However, I think the risk of being involved in potential fraud is too high for my comfort.

Good luck finding a wallet that will support this out of the box.  Just realize that you will basically need to write your own wallet since most of them will only scan ahead 20 to 40 keys.  So if you generate a receive address with index number 4,000, your wallet will never see it.

You can click the QR code on the paywall and it will automatically open the wallet installed on your laptop (assuming it supports the bitcoin uri).  For example Electrum will open on my laptop when I click the QR code.
Also, you can install something like Kryptokit in your browser that will automatically make it easy to pay for things on web pages.
I don't mind using my phone myself though...
@_date: 2015-12-14 13:53:09
Wow that is pretty crazy.  The site is running a little slow as well.
Edit: I wonder if this has anything to do with the announcement of lower fees for high volume traders.  They priced it so that if someone moves 20% of the volume of the exchange then they get a big kickback.  I bet there was an institutional trader working a deal to get on there.

Shouldn't we be able to see the transactions that SR thought they were sending + the transactions that the "scammer" pushed on to the network after they changed the script to verify what they are saying?  I thought transactions that were not accepted were still able to be seen for X amount of time.  If the duplicates are not present then they are lying.

I am using a combo of bitcoind and Bitcore on the server side to generate addresses, validate payments, and pass through the payments to the owner/user.  Now that I have learned more, I could really get rid of bitcoind and just have it all be based on the Bitcore API.

@_date: 2014-06-01 02:19:06
I haven't heard of a BIP for it, but there could be.  Most likely if you're going to be doing micro transactions though, you would be paying for something, so there would need to be other infrastructure in the payment process.
@_date: 2014-05-31 20:32:50

For small items like a cup of coffee or donuts, they accept it as soon as the payment is broadcast across the network.
@_date: 2014-12-16 21:43:08
Not sure why anyone hasn't mentioned this, but you can use a torrent to download a majority of the blockchain and then start from there.  (This is waaay faster than using peers to get the whole blockchain).
Also when I have previously used the peer method, I had to restart bitcoin many times as it would hang.
[See the bottom of this page for the torrent link](
@_date: 2014-06-02 02:47:19
One thing that came up recently is that some articles were claiming that the bitcoin network was processing $300 million per day.  If you could find out a way to process the data and figure out how much of those transactions are actually just change output going back to the sender it would be a really big deal.  This data would be used to directly compare the bitcoin network with Paypal/Western Union/etc.  
Nobody really has figured this out yet. [Blockchain.info]( has a chart that tries to do this, but I'm not sure they publish their method and also how accurate it might be.
@_date: 2014-09-11 14:32:00
The user sets a single payment address in the code where they want to get paid.  The payment gateway generates a new address for every page view and monitors for the payment being made to that specific address.  Once the payment is made to the gateway, the page gets unlocked and the payment is forwarded on to the users single payment address.  Make sense?
If you look at the demo, every time the page loads, a different address is shown.
@_date: 2014-09-26 00:49:15

@_date: 2014-03-11 01:49:55
I think the business model might be the most important... if there were a few million dollars thrown at this, then I'm sure it would be easier to get developers working on it.  Is there a way that Colored Coins could do some sort of App Coin or offering in order to be able to use the network once it's out?
@_date: 2014-09-11 12:38:51

Right but who is paying 20% premium for bitcoins today?  I am trying to understand who this would be.

I could very well be totally naive in assuming people have access to services to buy bitcoins for near market price.
@_date: 2014-10-28 03:12:47
Most likely one of your scripts is invalid.  I ran into this same error creating a multisig transaction that was "valid" but didn't take into account some bugs that are expected to be worked around with multisig (padding 0s in the script).  It doesn't look like this is the same issue, but it was the same generic error that doesn't describe the actual problem.  Hope that helps.

@_date: 2014-05-31 20:40:58
Yeah, I think this is a great idea.  You'll have to build in some infrastructure or logic so that the payments only get sent once they reach a certain size... I think this is where the micro transaction solution would come into play.
@_date: 2014-12-22 01:10:17
Were there instances of people getting it wrong or just not supporting it?
@_date: 2014-05-27 14:07:50
It doesn't look like they try to strip out change addresses from the transactions and just report the total value.  In my mind it is wrong to say $1 billion was transferred on the network on those days.
@_date: 2014-04-22 14:38:44
My original thought was that they were trying to give a select few large holders of MSC a "good deal"... Maybe the BitAngels?  Looks like it might have backfired.
@_date: 2014-02-17 22:53:14
My hypothesis is that value of the Bitcoin network can be derived from the transaction fees.  Since all uses of the network ride on top of the transaction technology, we can use the transaction fees to gauge how valuable it is. The people wouldn't be willing to pay a fee if it didn't provide some benefit.

I am still trying to wrap my head around the idea of someone paying a 20% premium to get bitcoins.  It sounds too good to be true to me... and I usually associate that with something shady happening.
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:11:06
I think this may be it.  Unless someone comes up with (and explains) a way to approximate the value transferred, it is just somewhere under that max.
@_date: 2014-12-18 02:55:10
This is still the part that I don't understand... "and finally the hub gives proof of that send to Alice."
If Bob is offline then how does the hub prove that the money that was sent to Bob has actually been allocated to Bob.
Peter's answer to this question: "The proof is just a valid half-signed transaction, or even just an ACK from Bob w/o tx info."

Yeah, I think right now you may be right, but if crypto currencies become mainstream, I think many people (including myself) would rather pay taxes on any gains than be worried about getting audited and pay fines.  Also, there is a chance you could lose money and be able to take a deduction, and pay less taxes.

My personal feeling is that it will fade away at some point... and when it does it will be removed from the index.
@_date: 2014-09-14 00:46:17
This only works if you want to send a bunch of transactions all at once to different people. If you want to wait and aggregate small payments over time, this will not work since the receiver doesn't know for sure if you will ever actually send the transaction out.  You will need to use something like micropayment channels to allow small payments being aggregated in a trust-less manner.
@_date: 2014-02-22 01:19:47
I made my first in person purchase today at [Rise Biscuits and Donuts](  They even gave me a T-Shirt!
However, I definitely saw the immaturity of the technology.  They told me that people on iPhones using HTML wallets were having trouble reading and uploading the QR codes.  The Coinbase app also didn't show the entire QR code on the screen on the Android tablet so they had to switch to portrait mode.  Once I submitted my transaction... crickets...  not even a loading animation on the tablet.  My wallet then showed the transaction as sent but still nothing for 3 or 4 minutes.  I hung out and they went back to look on the computer, came back and said they didn't see anything on their account, and then magically it said "paid".  In total it probably took 5 minutes for the transaction to say it was good, and the Coinbase app didn't show any sort of animation or anything to show it was working.
All in all, I got some awesome donuts, a free t-shirt, and an experience that I had been waiting for.  It's only going to get better, and I got to nerd out.

The difference is in the script that is embedded in the transaction.  When validating a transaction, the nodes will run the script and see if it was successful or not, based on the inputs.
A "normal" transaction is Pay-to-Pubkeyhash, which says validate the transaction if someone can provide the public key and signature for the input address/hash.
A "1 of 1" transaction is Pay-to-Script-Hash, which says validate the transaction if 1 of 1 signatures are provided for the input script (which lists the valid public keys that could be signed).
@_date: 2015-01-16 20:35:09

More of a comment than a question... but I recently sent a transaction using your BitPay wallet and it subtracted the entire amount from the shown balance including the change that was coming back to me.  This gave me a scare thinking that I did something stupid.  If you want to make this less confusing to newbies you should probably show more like a bank statement would.  The balance up top should show the full value and the pending should show the amount being subtracted.  I understand why it is implemented this way due to unconfirmed values coming back, but I don't think this matches with current expectations of users.  Other than that I really like the wallet and card.
@_date: 2015-07-01 02:35:52
Yeah, I think there are a few wallets that have bugs (maybe rounding bugs?) that will not send the exact amount requested even though it is in the QR code.  What wallet were you using?

That's interesting... I didn't know that you could have more than one output in the payment protocol.  
I think I would need something more dependable since I can't guarantee the customer should have a wallet that supports it though.  Not sure what a valid fallback plan would be other than making them send 2 transactions.  
If the Bitcoin URI could have more than one address then I think it would be doable.  You could have one QR code that defines 2 different address outputs.
@_date: 2015-04-26 19:22:45
If bitcoin was valued like a company (big stretch) you would use company earnings.  The only thing similar to earnings for Bitcoin would be to treat it like a DAC and use transaction fees as "earnings" that the company is making.  If you would assume around $4,000 per day transaction fees going to the miners this would be around $1.4 million a year in earnings.  Then you would need a multiplier, which you could use 100X for something like a startup.  This would give it a total market cap of $140 million.  Then you could divide this by the number of available bitcoins (14 million) and get an estimated value of $10. 
As you can see, today a bitcoin is worth over $200, so this method is not being used by the majority of the market.  If you can come up with a better way to value bitcoins and understand the true value then you could make a killing.

Payment processing won't be done there... but one of the goals behind Extended Public Keys is to be able to send one from your wallet to a payment processor.  They will then use this to generate receive addresses on your behalf.  Then any funds that are received to that public key will automatically be spendable from your wallet.
If the wallet only keeps track of a hard coded number of "look ahead" addresses then it could miss incoming transactions.

This service shows that a distributed Grid of computers can perform work in return for Bitcoin and drive costs lower than traditional Cloud Computing.  Anyone can join their computer to the network to get paid.  Check out [Ping21]( if you want to run a node and get paid in bitcoin, and check out [E16]( for more details about the Grid.

Yeah, when using xPub keys for payment processing on something like a paywall, you might have 100+ customers not pay.  Making it configurable would close the loop on being able to spend the funds.
Great job for adding this feature!  Once the "lookahead" is configurable, we'll be able to use Mycelium for spending everything.

What would be a price you would be willing to pay to skip ads for content like this?  Just curious if there is any amount?  Would it need to be less than 10 cents or less than 1 cent?

This address has no transactions sending money to it...
Are you sure your client successfully sent the transaction?
***Edit: The transactions have posted.  It should now be unlocked for you on the video page.

I am wondering what the optimal cost should be for content like this...  I would assume a higher price could be charged for something like a full featured movie, but for something like this a good price might be lower.  
Any thoughts?

Yeah, taking the xPub from Mycelium and generating a key with "m/0/0" did work.  Mycelium saw the incoming transaction when I sent coins to that address.
I swear I tried it last night but I may have just been doing something stupid.  Thanks for the help!

Ah yes... the famous Coinbase hang.  Notice how it says "pending"?  This is why they say to not use Coinbase as a wallet when paying for things online.  Many people have previously complained about it when buying items online because sometimes it even takes longer than the 15 minutes that BitPay uses as a timeout on the check-out page.
The good news is that once coinbase does finally send the transaction, go back to the page and it will be unlocked (assuming you have cookies enabled on your browser so it can remember your session from before).

What are you building with it now that you have it?

Spam transactions are subjective.  On man's spam is another man's political statement.  Keep testing those wallets from my point of view!

I have been running it for about a week and have received 37 Ping21 requests and made $0.74 so far.
@_date: 2016-07-06 00:31:04
I am currently a consumer of the Ping21 application issuing a minimum of 10 pings per day.  I am building statistics about the 21 network though, so it is not a commercial use quite yet.

This "article" explains nothing about them being high risk.  It says that they are annoying, which I'm sure everyone here could probably agree with.

What is it in violation of?

I'm guessing no other comments are here yet because the personal finance experts just read this and choked while drinking a Diet Pepsi and asphyxiated themselves.

So has that fund already invested the 60 million into bitcoins or are they just raising money at this point?

I will be following your move in a couple of months.
