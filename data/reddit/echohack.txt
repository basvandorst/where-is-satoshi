That's because many people are narcissistic idiots who don't understand the danger of being rich and wanting to live a normal life. This man might die, his family raped, his brain tortured because he probably has a brain wallet for his immense sums of cash. Being a famously rich **industrialist** is not some romantically alluring position to be in. It's precarious and destroys your life, for a normal person, let alone Sakamoto's **preference** and **belief** in a simple, humble life.

Are they lost? Allow me to reread the summary and I'll get back to you. My understanding was that they weren't lost. 
RETURN: They are not lost. It's not at all like a hard drive. From the website: A recovery seed is generated the first time you run TREZOR and will help you recovering it's contents (private keys, bitcoin balance and transaction history) into a new device if you lose your TREZOR. 
It's like saying losing the map to your treasure chest means you've lost the treasure. If you kept the duplicate map you made when you first drew it up, the treasure is safe and sound; you just have to get to it before someone else does, and because you wrote it with a cypher, you stand a **very** good chance of it. 
Again, nothing like a hard drive, from my understanding.

Don't complain about people misreading your posts when you use your conjunctions so poorly. The quoted sentence is a fully formed idea presented as truth with no modifiers. 
As it stands, you don't even modify the quoted text until the last clause of the second to last sentence. 
Perhaps if you were willing to sacrifice stylistic sentence separation for a longer thought that combined both clauses, the point you were trying to make would have been clearer. 
TL;DR: There's a big difference between 
"Your bitcoins are lost." [insert two paragraphs] "However, they aren't." 
and 
"Even if you lose your device, the bitcoins are recoverable. Using a backup taking the form of...."
