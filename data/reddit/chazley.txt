The fact this absurd post got 12 upvotes is slightly disconcerting to me.

An electrum wallet with P2SH GUI support would go a long way. No idea why they released a bech32-only segwit wallet so early
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:37:46
Livecoinwatch is the best in my opinion.

As important as it is for everyone to use Segwit when possible, we have two very large problems. First, we need a bech32-supported wallet from Core so we can end this two types of Segwit addresses charade and everyone can get to bech32 (the better Segwit version). Second, Electrum should release a p2sh version of their segwit wallet until bech32 is ready (Core estimates 0.16.0 release for May. Yikes.)

Gonna have to try harder than that.
@_date: 2018-01-16 09:55:02
Import your private keys into Electrum and then use either "replace by fee" or "child pays for parent". Make sure you spend at least 200 sat/byte on the replacement fee. Miners will have to include your other transactions and they average out the fee between the child and parent transaction (based on sat/byte total between the transactions).

The difference is that BCH believes in supporting an unlimited blocksize. We are talking about a 2mb blocksize. We CANNOT ever get to a place where everytime we have an issue with scaling, we increase the blocksize. However, in this particular instance we KNOW at some point a blocksize increase is inevitable, and a 2mb block would immediately alleviate a ton of pressure on the network, drastically reducing fees and dropped transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-15 06:06:47
I'm asking the community to get behind a 2mb hard fork, yes. To your question why would it help... I think it's blatantly obvious. Bitcoin has reached a tipping point in terms of popularity and use and Segwit/LN are not here yet (Segwit still isn't supported by the Core wallet used by many businesses). We know that a blocksize WILL happen at some point. Why are we waiting when right now we desperately need one to alleviate network pressure? Is there an argument for waiting on the inevitable?
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:39:19
Let me ask you a question... Do you think all scientists are biased based on the fact they are mostly funded by governments? It's not a perfect example, but my point is just because someone is funded/paid by an entity or government does not mean everything they ever do is biased. Core developers cannot just work for free for years - they have lives. Just because someone is paying them doesn't mean we should demonize them.

Bitcoin going to zero would require me selling my Bitcoin ever. That's not happening, so your statement of "it's going to zero or $500,000" is false. Hodl.

Yes, and I think LN is going to be revolutionary in the crypto space, making most other alts useless. The issue is we have no idea how far away it is, not only from being released but from actually being implemented by businesses. On top of that, LN is going to require a blocksize increase at some point anyways. 
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:12:50
Lukejr is one developer. His opinions do not represent every opinion of every developer. In fact, I would argue it's healthy there are voices among the core team that argue in drastically different directions. So, while I think he is completely wrong, I don't think its particularly unhealthy for Bitcoin. That being said, people like to use lukejr as a poster child for small blocks and how Bitcoin is doomed, but he is simply a single radical developer in a group of hundreds.

If you have a third party site charging you that, they are ripping you off. Fees aren't that high - yet.
@_date: 2017-12-30 05:44:38
I don't think there's any reasonable, progressive bitcoin supporter that doesn't believe that at some point the blocksize will have to be increased. The question is when.
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:49:05
I've watched all of Andreas' LN videos. I still have the same questions.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:14:25
So you don't support LN then? Cause LN is likely gonna need bigger blocks.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:30:19
This is not true. The reason why centralization is so much more efficient is because there is a central authority dumping money into it so they can then turn around and make a profit on it. Decentralization (bitcoin) is much more inefficient because there is very little money to be made (incentivizing faster upgrades and more people/testers on the project). If you suddenly had millions of dollars available for bug bounties and development, LN would've been ready a year ago. But this is the sacrifice you make when your end goal is decentralization and changing the world. Bitcoin isn't a business. There are no deadlines. The only thing that matters is getting it right, no matter how long it takes - and that can make it extremely slow.
@_date: 2017-12-31 06:40:37
Disagree. It makes it stronger because it provides further evidence that bitcoin is decentralized.
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:40:47
Everyone always points the fingers at blockchain.info, coinbase, and other businesses - and that is fair, but how about CORE updates their wallet to integrate full segwit support - it's ABSURD that it is not done yet and every website/business that uses the core wallet is hamstrung from implementing segwit because of it
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:44:34
You missed the entire premise of my post, which was if blocksize must be increased regardless, why not do it now? I'm not even debating whether or not a blocksize increase is a good thing. The fact is, to implement LN devs have gone on record many times saying a blocksize increase is likely needed. I personally think going from 1mb to 2mb right now would have next to zero effect on current centralization - which is already high.
@_date: 2017-12-31 03:06:50
Completely agreed upon? No. No entity or person gets to decide what is best for everyone, and there is never 100% agreement on anything. That's what makes bitcoin beautiful.
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:47:43
Go read the Lightning Network white paper. It's mentioned a few times that a blocksize increase in the long term is likely necessary.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:40:38
You may be right, I can't say for sure although I'd like someone with an expert understanding of LN to verify that. Also, doesn't include the fact there may be services like Gdax around that will offer free transactions still that you could use to open channels (not sure about closing).
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:02:57
Blockstream is a business. Correct. I have no idea how they plan on making money off of this, that is for someone smarter than me to explain. However, just because I cannot explain it, does not mean I need to make up a conspiracy theory claiming their intentions are nefarious. Do you have any support to back up your claims? Or do you have a bias towards thinking that money=evil in all situations?
This is the problem with the anti-blockstream argument. It's like someone seeing a UFO in the sky and saying "Look, it's an UFO! It must be an alien spacecraft!" No. First, you admitted you don't know what it is because of what the U in UFO stands for. You do not get to then jump to a definitive statement that it is an alien spacecraft because "what else could it be?". Sometimes it's ok to be ignorant and accepting it could be multiple possibilities. Blockstream could for example be planning to get Core developers in their good graces to hire them later to both implement and teach about LN to prospective clients/businesses. That would be extremely lucrative and a great ROI. I do not know what it could be. I do have extreme confidence in the Core developers though and do not there is a giant conspiracy by Blockstream to take down Bitcoin.

The LN white paper states that a blocksize increase will be "likely" required for it to scale. I support a 2mb blocksize increase immediately, because if it is happening anyways, I don't believe there is any good reason not to do it now when the network desperately could use it.
@_date: 2017-12-29 03:04:42
Not necessarily. You could find a service that batches transactions for opening/closing channels, or you could find a service/exchange that offers free transactions to open/close channel (like Gdax does now). So, it may end up being free for the layman. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 05:59:33
Can you find me an instance of a LN engineer saying that LN will not require a blocksize increase? That is my point. It is going to happen eventually anyways - why are we waiting around while fees are insanely high. There is almost zero evidence that 2mb blocks would have any effect whatsoever on centralization.
@_date: 2017-12-31 02:24:10
Because a hard fork is contentious and would split the community. Bcash was a hard fork for example. A soft fork doesn't require everybody to comply. If you want to use legacy addresses for transactions without Schnorr/Segwit/Lightning, you can. Soft forks simply apply updates/upgrades to the network and people can choose whether or not to implement them.

Sure, but what is cheaper/more profitable for a business - integrating an altcoin or investing in Bitcoin's infrastructure? There are very few examples of businesses being able to profit off the implementation of new Bitcoin technologies that isn't cheaper to do in other ways.

Does anyone have a link that shows the % of transactions that are Segwit?
@_date: 2018-06-11 08:13:47
"A small percentage back" is quite generous.
@_date: 2019-12-02 20:10:09
One of the things that scares me about Bitcoin is that people like John McAfee are given a platform to express their opinions and this community falls for it every time because they're desperate for anyone to advocate for the narrative of "Bitcoin price is going up in the future". John McAfee has been so wildly wrong about price predictions and altcoins it actually *scares* me more than anything that he says Bitcoin price is going to skyrocket. The guy is a complete lunatic and he needs to be shunned. 
In my opinion, until we can cheaply and instantly send Bitcoin 100% securely using second layers, and applications are built on top of it that are easy to use and have use cases that have practical, real world use, Bitcoin price will continue to disappoint. This is likely several years away.
@_date: 2019-04-18 11:32:08
If this Bitcoin bull/bear market cycle we've gone through has taught me anything, it's that technical analysis of any kind to predict future prices is complete and utter bullshit.

Anyone else notice a bunch of non-full blocks getting mined while the mempool still has several thousand transactions? Wondering if the mining pools put back into place the satoshi/byte requirements that make the mempool continue to grow.

Someone just reported to me that their Coinbase mobile app just updated and it had to do with Segwit. Can anyone confirm?
@_date: 2018-02-21 02:18:19
That website is horrible, DO NOT use it as a reference for what fees to use.
The best tool available is 
You can see which transactions are clearing for the amount of satoshis/byte. Satoshis/WU would be the ideal measurement but I don't know of any wallets or websites that display it, so using satoshis/byte works although not perfectly if you are using Segwit. So, telling us what amount of BTC you are paying doesn't really help us understand if it's sufficient or not, you need to tell us what satoshi/byte you're planning on sending with - I will say though .0004 BTC is likely far too high.
@_date: 2018-02-22 07:03:12
It typically gives very inflated estimates in terms of recommended fee and confirmation times. During times when every transaction basically gets through immediately, it works fine, but during times when you need to start using bigger fees, it gives you bad estimates.
