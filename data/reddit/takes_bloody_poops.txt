You don't usually find bags of diamonds?
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:13:42
Math, obviously.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:14:15
*laughs nervously*
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:21:04
It literally cannot fail. As long as at least a couple computers are still mining, BTC will exist, even if it's worthless. That's why I have most of my money in it (which isn't much).
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:07:22
Basically, it's popular because it's popular.
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:07:57
Nah, sell at $114k to be safe.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:43:47
I think he meant to say, extra 30% on the interest, since it won't be taxed at retirement.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:21:48
ROFL. Got em!
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:21:30
ROFL. Got em!
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:44:10
Exactly. The Tether being pumped in will always correct the price.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:08:39
Lmao, did you seriously just recommend day trading?
@_date: 2018-01-20 04:09:05
Well not directly from me, but from the entire bank. I have a savings account with Wells Fargoe, and they have suffered several bank robberies lately. Like literally a guy holds people at gunpoint and walks out with bags of cash. To cover the losses they just take a percentage out of everyone's account. They sent out a newsletter about it explaining everything.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:02:58
If you don't care about possibly losing all of your wealth, you are correct.
@_date: 2018-01-21 01:17:49
Help I'm falling behind! What should I do? What cryptos should I put all my money in so that I don't die?
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:54:11
It was all the rage when it surged past $10k the first time.
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:46:27
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:41:36
Yes for a person with very little funds, gambling on the bitcoin price is an excellent strategy.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:21:41
-says every person ever
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:13:06
Please keep holding until I sell thx.
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:36:08
Your kids are so lucky. They will be on top of the new world order when BTC finally crushes Fiat 500c.
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:21:40
ROFL. Got em!
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:07:06
Thank god I've been storing my value since mid December.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:18:11
Negative is the best time to buy!
@_date: 2018-01-23 03:44:16
I think he meant to say, extra 30% on the interest, since it won't be taxed at retirement.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:31:10
Fuck the moon. We're going to the stars!
@_date: 2018-01-20 18:03:39
Exactly. I'd much rather have my currency value determined by market manipulators, whales, sketchy exchanges, and whims of public opinion than the calculated and controlled manner the fucking gubberment does.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:07:44
Or you lose even more money.
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:10:38
Ah yes, the market manipulators will just disappear!
@_date: 2018-01-31 21:02:20
Ok I actually laughed out loud
@_date: 2018-01-31 06:31:15
I missed the "viable" you had in there. With regards to decentralization, that's the case strictly because it's currently the most popular, right?
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:32:32
No way man, I can perfectly predict the pump and dump wave and make money with the whales.
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:31:17
Correct. My stupid fiat "dollars" are constantly being stolen out of my bank account, and the ones I have left I can't spend or transfer anywhere. I can't wait for BTC to solve these problems.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:20:28
Easy to say that now, but will you really? What if there's a clear move to a different tech? And $1k ends up just being a stop on it's way too $10? Would you still take that risk?
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:40:51
But the video game memories will be worth $2000 in 4 years.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:35:28
Negative value!
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:39:54
Same! Just emptied my 401k early (with 10% penalty) to buy in at $14.5k!!!
@_date: 2018-08-26 06:56:30
This is the most retarded post I've seen. Fiat is NOT AN INVESTMENT, nor was it ever meant to be. If you keep money in a savings account for 18 years you are retarded. At least put it in CDs or bonds for fuck sake.
@_date: 2018-08-26 18:22:59
Which part?
@_date: 2018-05-10 00:19:50
They should make banks for bitcoin private keys.
@_date: 2018-05-26 01:16:45
You don't like staring toward the ceiling?
@_date: 2018-08-02 19:11:30
Yes, Bitcoin is a far less corrupt system!
@_date: 2019-11-01 01:43:01
@_date: 2019-11-16 20:47:22
Yeah but he's not.
@_date: 2019-11-02 16:46:29
Your are a fucking moron. Not for getting scammed, but for putting 4 years of savings into BTC. LOL.
@_date: 2019-11-02 18:31:40
Nice double post. Yeah all my savings is in cars, lol.
@_date: 2019-11-02 19:13:59
I mean the first two thirds are identical so..
@_date: 2019-11-02 19:12:29
What are you even talking about
@_date: 2019-11-02 18:30:45
Lmao, "well u have a silly name!" Genius.
@_date: 2019-11-09 18:11:48
The only way to take it is to scam someone else for the same amount.
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:16:57
@_date: 2018-06-16 01:05:00
Because they could have profited 3% and now they're only profiting 1%? That's a net 2% loss.
@_date: 2018-06-17 03:16:11
So I should pay you 2% to borrow my money? The fuck?
@_date: 2018-06-17 03:18:44
I honestly think he must be trolling at this point.
@_date: 2019-10-07 07:45:15
@_date: 2018-06-09 18:04:05
Can you send them to me too?
@_date: 2019-02-07 06:47:34
you can buy USD with Euros?
@_date: 2019-02-05 07:00:25
@_date: 2019-02-01 20:49:56
So you are saying, "we are coming, and we are coming in waves"?
@_date: 2019-02-07 06:51:10
got em!
@_date: 2019-02-07 15:47:05
You can buy fees with Euros
@_date: 2019-02-05 07:03:42
This shit was upvoted like mad in the bull run, and you were downvoted for saying what most of the comments here say.
@_date: 2018-11-20 01:09:40
These posts are great. Well done.
@_date: 2018-03-28 02:11:42
I think more like 500bn
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:37:17
@_date: 2019-01-19 00:56:10
Ok I go all in 1.4 years from now
@_date: 2019-01-22 04:44:02
@_date: 2018-02-02 03:12:38
How do you figure?
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:03:23
"I was the last one to FOMO"
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:34:56
LMAO. Does the price in BTC change 10 to 20% each day?
@_date: 2018-03-28 00:38:22
What about me?
@_date: 2019-01-19 07:06:51
@_date: 2019-01-19 00:49:09
Mewn sewn?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:42:31
Where did you get your crystal ball?
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:41:35
Well only if nobody wants it. Do you not think all the alt coins take away from bitcoin's value?
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:02:43
Bitcoin might have limited supply, but crypto doesn't. Good luck with the demand for BTC though.
@_date: 2019-01-19 00:50:14
MOON SOON?
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:45:58
What tipped you off?
@_date: 2018-02-28 05:23:08
This is good for bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-01 20:57:57
Where it dips even harder each time?
@_date: 2018-02-02 20:07:28
Is the mooning phase over though (at least for a while)? The excitement over the last few months has been insane. EVERYONE has been talking about it, even my sisters who I've never discussed financial stuff with were bringing up bitcoin. Hard to imagine more excitement than that. Who knows. The whole thing has been a crazy ride.
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:42:02
Billions flowed in to try and get rich quick.
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:26:27
It's the perfect hedge!
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:39:31
I don't even like money!
@_date: 2018-02-02 18:46:42
But people watch sports BECAUSE of competition. Of course sports wouldn't exist without multiple teams. It's the entire point of it. I don't think that particular analogy holds.
I get that competition can be good for an entire industry, but I think most companies would love to stomp their competitors and be the only game in town.
I think with crypto you get a lot of folks who want to put money in, and they spread it out over multiple coins, or they go for cheaper ones. But who knows, maybe the general hype over all of crypto leads to higher BTC prices than if it was the only coin in existence.
@_date: 2018-02-02 09:54:25
Especially Tether
@_date: 2018-02-05 07:25:06
I had no stake in the super bowl, but I still watch and comment for entertainment.
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:18:53
You're going to pay me to take your money?
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:41:14
Go all in man. This is your only chance at Lambo-ing.
@_date: 2018-02-02 01:02:49
Bitcoin might have limited supply, but crypto doesn't. Good luck with the demand for BTC though.
@_date: 2018-02-03 04:44:29
Psh, only double?
@_date: 2019-09-20 16:46:51
Only if you were heavily leveraged into bread
@_date: 2019-09-27 00:22:45
lol. He has zero money unless he sells today.
@_date: 2019-09-20 16:48:25
What about lambos?
@_date: 2019-09-27 19:53:05
Ah the ol' itcherswoo!
@_date: 2019-09-27 00:26:19
I only play with what I can afford to tight.
@_date: 2019-09-20 16:53:40
Cheers from the blockchain
@_date: 2018-07-25 16:43:51
Yes they are both useless as currencies
@_date: 2019-09-20 16:55:57
This is true depending on your reference frame. From a reference frame outside the solar system, the Sun and Earth orbit a point between the two centers of mass, weighted by the mass ratio of the two. The Sun-Jupiter orbit lies completely outside the Sun.
@_date: 2019-09-27 05:46:36
@_date: 2019-09-27 00:26:44
Or current low.
@_date: 2019-09-20 16:52:36
Mmmmmmm, oil
@_date: 2019-09-27 17:40:18
Why? I thought it was a currency?
@_date: 2019-09-26 23:24:39
This. This is going to happen and it will be utterly euphoric.
@_date: 2018-07-24 20:23:20
Wow, a whole 6 locations in the US. Time to drive across 4 state lines!
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:35:56
Is this real?
@_date: 2018-04-25 04:43:33
@_date: 2018-04-26 18:49:54
Why wouldn't they?
@_date: 2018-04-09 05:26:33
@_date: 2018-04-08 23:39:27
Really good point
@_date: 2018-12-28 18:13:44
NO DUMP
ONLY PUMP
@_date: 2018-12-28 22:07:33
Nice troll job
