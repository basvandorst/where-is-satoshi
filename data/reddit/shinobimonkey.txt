Can you explain how a majority of miners centralized in one country with an oppressive regime don't act as middlemen? (In laymans terms)
Also can you explain how node operators in a world where they are heavily centralized don't act as middlemen? You physically _have to, with absolutely no way around it_ get your UTXOs and broadcast transactions through them. (In laymans terms ;) )

That was Satoshi speaking to someone complaining about fees. [Link](
The funny thing is, all of the transactions people like Roger freak out about are exactly as described here by Satoshi, sweeping together a shit ton of different outputs and are way bigger than average in terms of datasize. Its no coincidence Roger shows transactions like that, and then outright lies by painting them as normal.

As pointed out above, most people live paycheck to paycheck. People in that situation are going to open a channel and have it filled by their employer, and can spend it, and then have their employee top it off again, rinse and repeat. Channel opening/closing for them would really only be needed when coming into more money, getting a raise, etc. The businesses actually paying would need to open/close channels to reorg liquidity, but people living paycheck to paycheck should be able to leave channels open for very long time periods as its just "money out, money in."

Its more complicated. Its not just bandwidth, its also a nodes CPU that is a huge bottle neck. You don't just have to download blocks, you have to validate each signature in them as well as validate that each input in every transaction was validly in the UTXO set(which requires validating all the previous transactions that lead to them being there). 
So its not just about getting the data somewhere fast enough, its the people at that placing being able to validate that data fast enough as well.

As well, your understanding of Watchtowers is flawed as well. You don't have to "hire" a Watchtower. You give them a penalty transaction that pays them a small part of the coins if they catch an old state. You aren't just paying a "monthly fee" to the Watchtower, they only get paid if someone submits an old state and they penalize it.

I see this misunderstanding everywhere like wildfire. This lawsuit **is not** over "What is the real Bitcoin."
It is over the fact Roger had "BTC", a specific asset's financial ticker", as the only descriptor on a page sending people to buy "BCH", an entirely different asset.
This lawsuit isn't about "What is really Bitcoin," it's over misrepresentation of things by financial ticker symbol.

1) Users can combine opening/closings and mix their's with others using Coinjoin to save space.
2) Sidechains also potentially can soak up some use.
3) People might not want to hear this, but we're still a tiny community. We have no clue how many people might **want** to use custodial services. This would pull all that volume off chain.
4) Channel factories can extend the efficiency in blockspace use as a layer between the mainchain and point to point payment channels.
5) Things like Chaumian Ecash servers haven't been seriously explored.
6) There are still things like Tumblebit, which are kind of an iteration of Chaumian servers with improved qualities(not custodial), and downsides(more complexity in building).
7) Depending on how cheap things like Opendime can be made at large scale that can take some volume off chain.
8) The idea of raising the blocksize is not "This is never happening," its just not happening *now*. And when we've explored all the above ideas, optimized them, come up with all the ideas people haven't had yet, and there is literally nothing to be done but raise the blocksize: it will happen **if there is consensus**. And those raises, if there is consensus, will have exponentially more of an effect with all these other protocols and layers and services built on top. 
So can we service the whole world with LN as is right now, with the blocksize as is right now? No. 
Am I worried about that at all? No. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 00:47:32
The only risk is that the Opendime is not genuine.  This document will explain how to verify the device. I'm assuming you don't have a genuine Opendime to check against, so you can use the script hosted on their GitHub as opposed to the one loaded on the Opendime your acquaintance has(as this could falsely verify it if the Opendime is not genuine). I don't think there's a high chance its a fake, but for something like 10 BTC I would absolutely advise verifying it before handing over money.
That said, if it does pass verification and you choose to buy, I would not leave the 10 BTC on the Opendime long term. They are not meant for longterm storage, and cannot be backed up. So if you lose the Opendime you lose the coins. I leave small amounts on Opendimes for odd things, but 10 BTC is waaay past my threshold as far as an amount I would be comfortable leaving on one longterm.
Good luck, hope you get a steal of a deal. ;)
(P.S. Also if you do not know this person well, beware of the possibility of a robbery during the exchange. Being an Opendime, its as simple as taking the device back after receiving cash. Much different than having to doublespend an on chain transaction, etc.)

@_date: 2017-02-06 09:57:49
No one is dead set against raising the blocksize(even LukeDashjr who thinks it is insane to do so) **if there is CONSENSUS on doing so**. 
Segwit will enable Schnorr signatures, which will enable OWAS(One way aggregate signatures), which will allow all the signatures in a block using schnorr to *non interactively* be combined into **a single signature** that is all that needs to verified to validate a block. Compact blocks and FIBRE also tackle the relay issues that make bandwidth consumption too high for many users.
One half of that is done, the other half is being stoned walled by psychotic, irrational, and totally political FUDing and propaganda. When these things are done, making it possible to raise the blocksize without knocking nodes off the network, **then** we will start thinking about permanent solutions to blocksize. Bitcoin Unlimited's "solution" is beyond retarded.
And as well, my own? I have no fucking clue who he is, and have only read his posts in glancing at reddit. There are no *teams* here except where over-simplifying idiots are concerned. I support Core, and frequently talk to others who do, and there is an unbelievable diversity in opinions, ideas, and acceptable trade-offs.

Look at around you. This psychotic nonsense. Users screaming for specific mechanisms and actions instead of the result they want(faster confirmation, better scaling nodes, etc.) ending.

Actually sitting down and having a conversation instead of random people who legitimately seem like young kids with no clue how this works calling the people who've worked for years to keep this working "Nerds!" and telling them "Nerds have no power here!"
**When people start acting like civil human beings and having a discussion instead of screaming and demanding someone work on what THEY want, and stop attempting to hold the network and other people's money hostage for it.** You bought into the consensus rules as is, if you want them changed, talk with people, and LISTEN. Don't just scream and make demands. Maybe you'll see the things they are working on are to your benefit.

BU: 
1) This _was completely counting on FRAUD PROOFS_. Satoshi never figured out Fraud Proofs, the _entire thing his scaling assumptions counted on_. **This argument is bullshit**. 
(Satoshi also spoke about users possibly restricting chain space so they can still validate, and he didn't speak poorly of it).
2) It fixes _a bug_ in how TX IDs are computed. If you are against fixing problems just because it is what Satoshi did, that is a special kind of stupid.
3) Complete unfounded bullshit.
4) A hardfork is not safe _Because a HUGE portion of the userbase_ ***does not want one***. This has nothing to do with developers, ***Users*** do not want it.
5) Bullshit. Segwit enables further upgrades, which will work, which offer insane scaling benefits for both on chain and offchain. 
6) ***All they promised to do, and all they COULD DO, is propose a change***. They did that. 
1) This is an entirely accurate assessment of BU developers.
2) This is a serious problem, the fact you don't even know what it is tells me you are _wildly_ under informed here, and probably have no business making this post whatsoever, as you don't even understand the relevant issues. 
3) This is entirely wrong, you are again showing _you have no clue what you are talking about_. The problem with blocks getting too big is users can't _validate the blockchain_. Satoshi was okay with blocks getting big because he was going to design a fraud proof so full nodes could ***prove*** to a light wallet when something was invalid. He never figured out how to do this. So this creates a situation where blocks getting too big means you just have to trust people that the rules are being followed, that your coins are valid, and that they will relay your transactions. _Get your fact straight_. You look like a moron when you try to summarize someone else's arguments and get everything completely wrong.
4) BU puts the blocksize ***completely*** in the hands of miners, leaving users no way to guarantee they can make sure miners continue following rules, and no way to see if they are breaking them. Again, _get your facts straight_. 
5) Yes, they do hold those views. You however should not be holding a view just because someone else does. _You should strive to_ ***understand things yourself***. 
@_date: 2017-02-11 20:01:29
No, the SEC actually has very valid concerns here. Legal unclarity as to what Bitcoin is makes it very much possible for hardforks changing rules to allow such things to be done. Look at what happened with ETH and the DAO...
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:51:45
No, it has not. It has had one instance where the chain was _rolled back_ to counter billions of coins being issued. And another instance where _a chain split_ resulted in one side being orphaned.
*Neither* of those is a backwards incompatible permanent change of a consensus rule(s). **Neither** of those were a hardfork.

I wouldn't have ran that hardfork. Many others too. And all of this is gaslighting the reality of the situation. Almost all the developers, even those who think its stupid as hell, want a blocksize raise. Their issue is with doing optimization work that needs to be done _first_ to both make blocksize increases safer on the decentralization of the network, and amplify the throughput increase we get per byte.
I am not deviating from that course under any circumstances, as that is completely foolhardy.

@_date: 2017-03-14 00:11:00
Bitcoin's first mover advantage is not going to be disrupted quite so easily. All blockchains inherently suffer from the same scaling problems, so an altcoin that solves a fundamental problem of scale for itself would also fundamentally solve said problem for Bitcoin. So with a huge lead in network effect, that is not really a long term threat. 
As far as Lightning Network is concerned, the part that is "not ready" is the routing. It is "not ready" in the sense that it would not fair too well if you tried running it with a network of 100 million people all trying to transact through the lightning network, that will take time. But it is very much workable now on smaller scales, and is absolutely workable now deployed as a more hub and spoke model with a central payment hub. And miners who are worried about losing fees? Miners have _alot_ of coins sitting around, and with the only requirement to running a LN hub being coins to provide liquidity, it seems to me like miners are in a great position to operate LN hubs to maximize their fee income. They could even guarantee preferential blockspace for closing and opening channels with them if needed. 
When it comes down to it Bitcoin Unlimited is simply a wildly untested implementation with a drastically altered game theoretical model. Right now the economic collective of businesses and users decide the consensus rules, their willingness to trade a token under a ruleset is what gives this value, and they can unconditionally enforce that ruleset on the miners if miners attempt to coerce them into following rules they did not agree to. Bitcoin Unlimited's "emergent consensus" completely shatters the programmatic certainty of that consensus enforcement by introducing a user to user variability in what exact rules they are enforcing. This effectively in the grand scheme of game theory puts miners firmly in control here. This is a radical, and incredibly dangerous and unwise, departure from the current Bitcoin design and incentive structure that would be ill advised.

This is outright and utterly false. Segwit is a stepping stone enabling many more upgrades that will have a cumulative benefit to scaling, both on chain and off chain. Almost no one wants the status quo, but that has always been a potential outcome if consensus isn't found on the nature of changes. Thats always been the case, and denying that is lying to yourself. 
The argument of long lead time in a hardfork is not arbitrary, it is rooted in the need for security. A hardfork is an incompatible upgrade, you need to socially organize the upgrade outside of the system, and people screwing up fragments the system and can lose people money. As well, hard forking without consensus will guarantee people will refuse to upgrade and stay on the original network, which will cause unbelievable chaos for the ecosystem at large. Advocating this is reckless and stupid. 
**Segwit is the compromise**. Denying this is _gaslighting_. People making arguments along the line of yours have the same fatal flaw, you immaturely and in a very childlike manner abstract the market away as some amorphous thing that always agrees with your wants and needs. **You are dead wrong.** The market is composed of individuals, you, me, everyone out there participating in Bitcoin. And cumulatively it looks like the market isn't bothered by the status quo now, supports Core by a vast majority, and isn't buying these bullshit delusional attempts to rewrite and white wash history.

Absolutely not. Especially not with BU, which comes with the guarantee of large reorgs whenever the blocksize is raised. Its possible to create 2 MB blocks that take 15 minutes to validate. If a miner has no blocksize restriction whatsoever, not only is there no predictability to the cost of running a node, without further optimizations of Bitcoin miners could create attack blocks would take hours to validate. Essentially stalling the entire chain.
There are so many complex facets of things intertwined with this issue, the paramount one being the security and integrity of the network at large, and naive or misinformed(or malicious) dismissal of this is unacceptable. It is not as simple as smaller blocks = bad, bigger blocks = good.

**FALSE**. Nakamoto Consesus, using POW, is the mechanism by which VALID BLOCKS under a PREDECIDED ruleset is to be chosen to extend the chain.

Because nodes staying in consensus requires to the bit _the exact same results_ when processing blocks and transactions. This is why most developers in this space are so cautious with changes, and testing, to ensure bugs do not slip into releases. If something is different, a bug can cause a consensus failure. When you work with different code bases, different languages, etc. the chances of two clients coming to different results analyzing data increases greatly. Bitcoin is not your run of the mill piece of software.

No, we reached a compromise position. It was Segwit, followed by a hardfork _proposal_. It was explicitly spelled out to miners all developers can do is propose a hardfork, and activation is up to the users. The compromise *that was reached already* has been followed to a T by developers so far. Miners are the ones who have completely ignored the agreement.


Core can only **propose** a fork. They cannot just show up at my house, put a shotgun in my face, and force me to upgrade. This entire narrative/notion/fallacious conception is totally contrary to reality. **Users** are the ones pushing back against ill advised proposals, and intent on enforcing a 1 MB limit for now. Developers have nothing to do with it, and them wasting time writing code it is clear as day there is no consensus on activating would be nothing but a waste of time.

That is a joke. That introduces a requirement to create identities, have a process for people entering and leaving the ring, and turns everything into a federated system. The entire point of mining and POW is just functioning as a dynamic federation where people can leave or enter and POW stands as the replacement for set keys. They order transactions for fees and a subsidy, that is it. They do not decide the rules. The rules were already set out, and you either follow them, or don't. Not following them and following a new ruleset is creating a new system. 
If miners decided the rules, the last sentence of Satoshi's white paper would be "Miners can *decide on any modifications* to the ruleset with this system." Not ""Any needed rules and incentives *can be enforced* with this consensus mechanism."
Show me **anywhere** Satoshi explicitly said miners vote on rule changes. Your position is entirely absurd, as miners burning energy doesn't guarantee **any** of the qualities, rules, or token balances of the system that is Bitcoin. It just guarantees energy was burned. **Validating users** are what guarantee the qualities, rules, and token balances of the system that is Bitcoin.

Segwit **is** a blocksize increase. BU is entirely political, and a bluff. None of these pools are actually running BU except Roger.

You are a completely reckless and immature goon if you seriously think it is wise or safe to repeat that with Bitcoin, _something people actually use for real economic activity._


No you are not, all the market participants supporting Core are not supporting a refusal to ever increase the blocksize, they are refusing to support that _at the moment_ for a much more intelligent upgrade ready right now.

Remember, if you can't provide the resources for a node, you cannot be a peer on the network or sovereign over your own money. This is unbelievably sophistry at its finest.

You're missing alot. Your node validates the blocks based on the contents of the blocks. It checks the POW in the header, making sure that it meets the valid network difficulty(which is itself encoded in the header of a block), then it checks the contents of the block and makes sure all the signatures are valid, that all the transaction inputs are valid unspent outputs in the UTXO set, and then updates its UTXO set with the changes in the block if it is valid. You getting the blocks from Blockstream's satellite instead of over a traditional internet connection makes no difference. You cannot be sent fake blocks, and then worst that can happen is it stops sending blocks, in which case you just connect your node to the internet again and catch up.
tldr: You using Blockstream's satellite link instead of the internet to get blocks creates no material change to the security of your node at all. And if you're really paranoid, you can go check a block explorer or someone elses node periodically and just check the hash of a single block to make sure you're still in sync with everyone else. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:22:55
...No. You are running a node, it is relayed blocks, it checks the POW meets the difficulty requirements, and it validates the blocks. It is a completely full node, exactly like any other. The medium of transmission for blocks makes no difference at all.

No, they couldn't even doublespend their own addresses unless they have hashpower, which to my knowledge they do not. (Speaking of a doublespend involving an actual chain reorganization, but a doublespend just involving unconfirmed transactions wouldn't matter because only one will make it into the chain your node receives.)

1) And? How is that any different than holding valuable real estate? Or natural resources? If you hold something that will hold value or appreciate in value, you gain. Whoopydoo. You're whining about nothing.
2) It protects the value of *anyone who can acquire it*, which chiefly includes people producing valuable products and services. So your "No" is objectively delusional magical thinking ignoring reality. If you need capital, work and acquire it instead of whining like a cry baby socialist for it to be handed to you.

Bitcoin's goal isn't to remove all wealth inequality, and if you think it is I don't know what you're here for. 
There are two problems Bitcoin is attempting to address:
1) People don't have control over their own wealth. Everything is locked up in bank accounts that you can be trivially locked out of, be prevented from making transactions you want, and otherwise being entirely at the whims of the people who operate these institutions. This applies to the dirt poor, the incredibly wealthy, and everything in between. 
2) The finite supply does not magically fix wealth inequality in the sense of giving everyone equal wealth, but it does fix it in the sense that it prevents the inherent structure of the monetary system being used to redirect wealth to people being non-productive. Removing inflation, which destroys peoples value saved in money, and removing the cheap lines of credit that inflation implies, which allow the already wealthy to invest in other assets closed off from normal consumers to negate the inflationary damage of their wealth and continue maintaining it in ways normal people cannot, will create a macroeconomic environment in which normal people have access to a safe store of wealth in the long term and the already wealthy cannot maintain their wealth by taking advantage of unfairly slanted economic structures instead of providing real economic value. In order to accumulate new wealth, you will actually have to provide products and services that provide real value, as you won't be able to play the kinds of games the wealthy do to maintain their position on top.

@_date: 2018-06-23 01:25:22


No, it does not. This is a temporary factor while the system as a whole accumulates value, and from that point on outside early adopters you _by definition_ have to be productive to accumulate. (And besides, contributing value to the system to keep it viable in itself is doing something productive, as the entire system is itself is valueable/useful but requires investment to remain viable). Being deflationary doesn't "direct value to the unproductive." It protects the value/wealth of the _productive_ who have produced to accumulate.

This is nonsense. The most outright nonsensical lie in this video is where he tries to imply "Blockstream" deactivated the opcodes that were removed from Bitcoin early on. Satoshi did that himself, because they were horribly broken and introduced numerous attack and denial of service vectors. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:06:27
His rationale is that objectively with a consistent amount of new coins being issued that doesn't change, in the long term that is effectively still 0% inflation and yet provides a consistent incentive for miners. I disagree with that change, but he's not objectively wrong.  This is how Monero works, and why Monero can have a dynamic blocksize(which is not possible without constant inflation).

As of right now I don't think they do, and no, you do not need to know the contents of the mempool to verify a block. Everything you need to verify the block is the block itself, the header contains the POW to show that was done validly, the difficulty target it has to meet, the timestamp to show roughly when it was made, the version of the block, and the merkle root to verify that all the transactions in the block are commited to in the POW. To verify that individual transactions are valid all you need is the blockchain and the UTXO set which your node will have.

The touchpad issue is a result of voltage differences in power cables and power sources, and can be easily mitigated by using a USB battery pack with predictable and steady power feed. It has been patched already with a sensitivity setting in the menu.
The p2sh-Segwit PSBT issue is not an issue with the Coldcard, it is an issue with the Electrum plugin failing to construct the PSBT with the redeem script. I encountered this issue too, and if you had actually tried to figure out what was going on you would have seen this is an issue with ELECTRUM and NOT the Coldcard. But instead you go crying to social media like a baby and telling people not to buy something. (PS, this issue has also been fixed and will be in the next Electrum release, but you can download the github right now and use it prior to that).
Terrible documentation? I think the issue is you having no language comprehension skills. The documentation is very clear, and the answer to this "issue" is quite simple: set a duress pin and then log into the coldcard with it and generate an Electrum wallet file. You being "scared to touch the brick pin" has nothing to do with documentation, and everything to do with you being irrational and wanting to blame someone else for your irrationality.

This is complete and utter nonsense on every level. Quick run down on how private keys/public keys/addresses in Bitcoin work:
You generate a private key, which is a very long number.
You generate FROM the private key your public key, which is in quickest simple terms just doing math to find another number provably related to your private key.
To get an address, you take the public key and run it through two hash functions.
Alright clear so far?
To get a public key from an address, means TWO hash functions have to be broken. SHA256 and RIPEMD160. These are one way hash functions, meaning you can get a hash from data, but cannot take a hash and reverse it into the data.
To get a private key from a public key, you need a quantum computer. The "one-wayness" of a private/public keypair relies on the discrete logarithm problem. Alot of modern cryptography relies on this assumption, and short of quantum computing, in the cases it is used it is impossible to go from public key to private key.
What is being claimed here is that a private key was reversed engineered from just an \*address\*. This is complete and utter nonsense. To reduce an address to a private key, you would have to break two hash functions(SHA256 and RIPEMD160) to produce a public key, and then have a quantum computer sufficiently power to break the discrete log problem and reverse it to a private key(which do not exist right now). You cannot just go from an address directly to a private key.
This is complete nonsense, fake news, full stop. Desantis is someone who makes off the wall outrageous claims on a regular basis, and Bryce Weiner is a shitcoin pumper who literally generates them like a normal person would a new to-do-list for the day.

100% bullshit. We got Segwit because BIP148 put pressure on the **handful of miners** that were intentionally delaying it to extort users. Stop attempting this pathetic white washing of history. NYA was simply a public excuse to not back down. Almost none of the miners ran BTC1, and F2Pool **publicly explicitly confirmed that**. They ran a patch of BIP91. 


It *is* a corporate takeover. 


The attempt to fork off, and steal that liquidity pool through a concerted effort to refuse to acknowledge Bitcoin(the original chain) as BTC while branding their new coin as BTC, is most certainly a takeover attempt.
If some group of corporations can just arbitrarily decide what is called Bitcoin, what is allowed to plug into that liquidity pool under that name/brand/network effect, then Bitcoin is totally defined by these companies. What is that if not a takeover attempt? And again please look at the caveat I placed with that statement, and don't just argue against strawmen.

I was not fast to call bullshit, I called bullshit outright after your very suspicious video **with the silicone removed which would allow you to damage the chips** was the only documentation you provided. 
The fact you are even trying to "replicate" what you called a factory defect is even further evidence of your completely being full of shit. How will you "replicate" something you claimed is an out of the box manufacturing error? Stripping the silicone and intentionally damaging it again?

We don't need a hardfork to increase capacity. A softforked extension block that slowly phases out use of the current "blockspace" would accomplish the same thing. It's just a matter of having to treat that as blockspace proper, and not pretending that because it is an extension block we can just not care about validation costs.
Slowly phasing things like this would also allow time for software to be upgraded to be able to utilize this, and prevent the risk of a chainsplit.

No. Bitcoin developers wrote a cryptographic library from scratch to not have to depend on broken and vulnerable libraries used widely on the internet. 
The reality of this situation is, Bitpay forced through a change without even considering the rest of the ecosystem, just assuming everyone would follow.

BIPs not related to consensus codes are not the same as consensus related BIPs. "Active" doesn't mean anything in the context you are implying it does.

That was someone else, not me. That is you inserting comments I did not make to muddy the waters of this discussion. 
Bitpay unilaterally pushed something into the ecosystem, don't get pissy with other people for not just blindly following a company in implementing something, especially when that company was one of the spearheaders of the NYA debacle, which would have **factually ground the Bitcoin network to a halt if followed through with**.

This is a complete nonsense verbose rambling. Upgrades and changes to Bitcoin either get balanced to 0 against the increased costs of validating, or they don't happen. Period. If you want to make changes without that in mind, you are free to fork off at anytime. 
Not only is your entire rambling there completely fallacious, in that you are projecting a distorted distinction that does not exist in the reasons behind Bitcoins existence. It exists *to be apolitical*, **period**. It also ignores the fact that if rules affecting the validation costs or core properties of Bitcoin are able to be changed through politicking, **period**, then it loses not only its value proposition as an apolitical money, but very quickly becomes subject to the whims of **P**olitics as you put it.

The entire problem with hardforks is two fold, 1) lead time to prevent a network split, 2) actually having support. Just doing a hard fork now fails at fixing BOTH of those problems.

That is completely unacceptable.

This is completely ridiculous. One, the number of SHA256 coins out there to mine is ridiculously small, and almost none are valuable. Coins don't just sky rocket in value because people mine them, people mine them because they are valuable. If a hardfork is not possible, **you BREAK EVERYTHING trying to just ram it through**. If its not things can be done through soft forks instead. As well, fees go up if the blocksize stays small. _This makes them more money, not less._
This is unbelievably simplistic and just plain incorrect thinking on the matter.

This is circular bullshit. All SPV clients **check the block header**. As well, disruptive and unethical? Nothing about leaving a user on the original chain **unless they CHOOSE** to move to a hardfork is unethical. What is unethical is proactively making that decision for them. 


This is more **circular bullshit**. _Everything_ depends on miners for transaction ordering. Miners **do not** decide whether their transaction ordering in a block is valid, others do. 


Miners do not decide what is valid. A longer chain does not make it valid, this is a **flaw** in SPV security models **that Satoshi himself** intended to fix with fraud proofs or some kind of alert system. **It is NOT** the intended functionality.

BIP9 was an improvement upon the previous BIP34 which allowed multiple softforks to be deployed at once. This is not simply a case of "BIP9's only intended purpose"(which you can read MANY developers essentially repeating what I said all over), this is about the purpose for having miners clearly signal they have upgraded first. The entire reason for this is so there is no risk of a chain split before all non-mining nodes have upgraded to enforce a new softfork. If 95% are enforcing the new rules, even if a miner in that 5% mined a block violating the new softforks rules, they would be instantly orphaned, so that unupgraded nodes would only be "fooled" for the span of one block. Without all miners upgrading these splits fooling unupgraded nodes could last longer. This is also equally well solved by everyone simply upgrading and enforcing. Hence the push for UASF. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 04:01:01
Right now Bitcoin shines as a store of value, and it does so because of its decentralization and the ability to validate everything yourself. It **has** to be able to store value to be able to successfully be a medium of exchange in the long run. This creates a conflict of interest between those who use Bitcoin chiefly to save their wealth, versus those who chiefly use it to pay for things or transact. This conflict can be solved through technical optimizations and the construction of second layers that use layered cryptographic relationships anchoring back to the main chain. Both can have their cake and eat it too. But only if done this way, to maintain the decentralization of the core layer which allows it to store value(which is required to transact it trustlessly), thats just how it works. 
So to put it bluntly, demand Segwit. People such as myself(which I believe is a large majority of those active in this scaling debate) are attempting to put forth solutions and a road forward that allow **both** groups to have what they want from Bitcoin. Those who push and champion fundamentally broken things such as BU, or just increasing the blocksize until nodes are only viable in datacenters, are essentially trying to push us down a road going forward that might as well be named "Fuck you, your concerns and needs, and the horse you rode in on."

Not really earonesty. A reasonably sized and _capped_ extension block is a totally reasonable proposal.

This is complete nonsense gibberish that essentially boils down to you talking out of your ass.(claiming to predict what other market participants will do).


This is you demonstrating you fundamentally do not grasp a UASF, or soft forks at all in general. A UASF will not cause a chain split. Miners throwing a temper tantrum and **the MINERS** initiating a hard fork away from that afterwards will. They can do that at literally any time.

This is complete nonsense. The relative centralization or decentralization of the system as a whole has much more to do with non-mining nodes than mining nodes. It is the decentralization of the **ability to validate the ledger** that is what gives Bitcoin its security. Everyone who is not validating the ledger independently themselves is explicitly trusting both the miners and others validating. To them it is fundamentally not much different from the current banking system and having to trust the ledger is not being fudged with. They are simply more secure in that trust because of how _distributed_ that ledger is amongst validaters. Every step you take in raising the costs of validating that ledger centralizes the copies of the ledger in a small group of validaters and factually weakens the entire core value proposition of Bitcoin in the first place by pushing it in a direction that emulates banks closer and closer.

Because miners have absolutely no role in deciding consensus rules whatsoever. BIP9 had a single purpose: to know when miners were enforcing, so NODES could safely activate. They have abused this by twisting it into being perceived as a voting mechanism for upgrades. That is factually not the case.
They have taken this manipulation of perception, and attempted to use it to coerce the rest of the network into accepting what they dictate as consensus rules. This is unacceptable. There is no compromising with someone who has no power, and is quite frankly, bullying people to attain it.
They build blocks within the rules the rest of the networks consensus rules, end of story. It seems very clear to me everyone except a small group with no rational arguments wants segwit, so UASF it is. If miners want to continue wasting money after that mining invalid blocks, so be it.

Length of the chain **does not decide validity**. Even Satoshi himself explicitly laid out in the whitepaper _a fraud proof system_ for SPV clients to be alerted to an invalid chain.
Using an SPV wallet is not opting in to blindly follow whatever rules miners enforce, and saying so is completely disingenuous bullshit. It is operating in a mode with wider surface of attack. Which is exactly what this is, in attempting to take advantage of this situation to just drag along SPV users. **People transact in Bitcoin daily**. Dragging them along with a hardfork without their active consent is disruptive and unethical. 
To say that a hardfork would not entice them to make a choice is also ridiculously asinine. If both coexisted, they would likely want a client for both(or capable of distinguishing between and switching between both) to **manage the free money they got** because of the hardfork. If the original chain died, they would upgrade to a wallet that utilized the hardfork. Like are you serious? They would just sit there for the rest of eternity and never go figure out why Bitcoin stopped working, and switch over when they realize a hardfork diverged and kept going from that point?
Your entire line of reasoning is just absurd. 
@_date: 2017-07-16 04:12:08


 
This is fucking ridiculous. The same way _they have been until now_. 
As for suggestions, yes: in the short-to-mid term make bootstrapping something manually configurable with a fallback _to the current seeds_ so you can initially bootstrap off the node of someone you know and trust, with the currently ran DNS seeds as a fallback. 
Long term: If Bitcoin truly grows to be important seed nodes will become a necessary piece of global internet infrastructure. You should be able to choose from a wide variety of seed nodes as a user, and decide who your information is leaked to(with redundancy to avoid a sybil attack near chaintip). That will be unavoidable until the point its practical to bootstrap a node through Tor/I2P or some other alternative.

As well this has nothing to do with the risk level for the hardfork, but the need for it in the first place, so I have no idea what you mean by that. This was about the rate of segwit adoption and the related incentives to do so, and the fact that the data he was basing his assessment of that rate on was fundamentally bad.

This is beyond ridiculous. A UASF is users choosing to enforce the rules they choose. Period. If businesses do the same, it is exactly the same. It is businesses simply doing the same. People are not just running nodes, they are also contacting their businesses to let them know they support BIP148 and want them to do the same. **You cannot sybil attack verified accounts with businesses**.
What you are proposing here is quite literally a sybil attack plain and simple.

1) No.
2) No, if there is less then 50% hashrate there will be a *chainsplit*. A chainsplit technically speaking happens every time there is an orphan race when two miners find a block at the same time. A *chainsplit* does not equal a hardfork. A hardfork is permanent and not backwards compatible because it introduces a rule loosening, allowing something *not possible before*. A **softfork** takes something that is allowed, and makes it not allowed anymore. i.e. blocks can not signal for BIP141, after August first they have to. Non-BIP148 nodes **will** accept the BIP148 chain as valid without proactively forking or altering their own consensus rules themselves. 
3) Two is incorrect, but I have something to say here anyway. **Who supports or doesn't support a hardfork in terms of public figures has absolutely nothing to do with whether or not it is contentious.** We support UASF because *others who are attempting to push contentious hard forks* are refusing to activate something(Segwit) that **DOES** have widespread support. For which both there has not been any argument against with any technical basis in reality, and a ridiculous tendency for arguments against it to shift so fast that people are making contradictory arguments compared to the ones they made last week.
These kinds of posts really reinforce the perception that business leaders in this space appreciate almost none of the technical aspects of how any of this works .

This is a ridiculously simplistic viewpoint that ignores the fact your node is not actually checking any signatures prior to the most recent checkpoint. That data could be modularly stripped out and not transmitted(or stored) by nodes. This would be a huge saving in bandwidth as well as storage. This would lower the costs of nodes, by giving people the ability to download with that historical signature data or without, and allow nodes to be able to handle both possibilities and advertise which they are equipped to help bootstrap.

False. A DNS seed is what provides IPs for other peers and begins the bootstrapping process of connecting to the peer to peer network.

I am not misleading anything or speaking to anyone's motive not running BIP148. **You** are projecting a strawman in that form to argue against some imaginary thing no one is saying anywhere. People want Segwit, if we get it activated without problems those same people would use it. That is a rationale and logical extrapolation.

Do you not think that would be a much more constructive thing to do?
*EDIT*: To expound a little more, this is the protocol, this is how it works, that simple. It is simply not possible to just change the protocol any time someone doesn't like what fees are, period. (And as a side note Ethereum fees are actually getting more expensive than Bitcoin fees ATM). The problem here, is whatever exchange you are using is either too lazy or too incompetent to upgrade their software to give you the option of choosing your own fee and therefore confirmation time. Instead they opt to demand that unpaid developers code something in their specific interests, and thousands and thousands of people just ignore their own interest and do whatever that business wants just because in the process of upgrading. That is just irrational, to be blunt, its retarded. Businesses operating under that mindset will not survive in this ecosystem.

@_date: 2017-07-16 07:35:26
That is false. Bitcoin's lack of fungibility is the result of not being able to interchange any two coins. The reasons that becomes impossible **is the analytical data that allows WHAT transactions they were involved in**. Without the meta data of what they have done, **it is fungible**. 
Your argument fails to carry over consistently with cash, therefore its invalid. Clearly two different coins are two different coins, but because you have no ability to determine where they came from or what transactions they have facilitated in the past, you will accept both equally. Bills even have **uniquely identifying serial numbers**, but for the aforementioned reasons you will accept bills without discrimination. 
It is soley through *the analytics* that provide that metadata that Bitcoins fungibility is broken.

* No. Most wallets connect to services nodes or your own node(which is becoming a more prevalent feature). "SPV" wallets will ignore anything the node its connected to does. There are not many SPV wallets out there working as an independent peer, and people are working on possible features for these to handle chainsplits relatively automatically. 


* No there is a guarantee unless you convince a bunch of idiots to start trading and valuing it, in which case you just created an altcoin.


* A 51% reorg attack is something the system is fundamentally incapable of dealing with without human decided checkpoints or a POW change.

No, a node is a piece of software guaranteeing that every bit of economic activity happening on the network I am a peer on is following the economic rules of the system I value, and therefore enforce. A node is why Bitcoin is sovereign money. i.e. why miners can't just make a block with a coinbase reward of 1000 BTC, even if *100%* of miners mined on that, no individual or businesses' or anyone's node would acknowledge that as valid or attach any monetary value to it. And a nice fact is that with fully developed second layer systems, minus the implications due to not being able to reorganize liquidity on chain, even if 100% of miners wasted their time and money doing something like that, **large amounts of transactional use can occur on second layers** until miners realize they are just wasting money.

Are you kidding me? Because reorganizing into a single chain is *not* precluded. 
@_date: 2019-05-01 21:20:01
In the sense of keeping the "network secure" or enforcing consensus rules, absolutely not. The only way you actually are enforcing rules is when you validate Bitcoin payments you receive with your own node. This is a very common misconception, if you are not using a full node to validate payments that you receive, it is NOT helping the network stay secure or ensuring consensus rules are enforced.
In the sense of helping the network by giving more sources for other nodes to download blocks, distributing the amount of resources needed to relay things around among more peers so that individual nodes aren't dealing with high costs to send data around the network to others, it arguably helps in this way. But this in no way safeguards consensus rules or helps "secure" the network.

No, its not. People who have concerns with Bitcoin are irrational, and starting form the false premise that the blockchain is meant to store every coffee purchase they ever make forever. Its not. Bitcoin's issue, as its designed simply to move value, is economic scaling. i.e. the cost effectiveness of making a transaction relative to its value/fee.

Secondary layers will provide cheaper access and use mechanisms for Bitcoin. As far as the mainchain itself is concerned, it would suck, but I agree 100%. I would easily pay 100$ in fees(and again, look at fees denominated in Bitcoin, they have not really gone up as drastically as their fiat value. That increase in fiat value is due to the increase in fiat _price_ for Bitcoin overall), it would suck, but I would sure as hell pay it and sure as hell view it as worth it for what Bitcoin allows you to accomplish. If you want to get real its already been economically not viable considering network fees for people in many underdeveloped countries to use the mainchain for years. People in certain parts of the world live on a dollar or two a day. Now consider they still have to eat, shelter themselves, acquire clothes/tools/etc. and they have less than a dollar left to purchase BItcoin **and** pay network fees to move it. 
_They have already been priced out for a long time_. Don't you think it would be more productive to continue optimizing and upgrading Bitcoin to allow them access to it in ways that are cost effective for them? And don't sit here and go "Raise da blocksize derp!" Because that is not a solution. The problem will immediately resurface when those blocks are full, and necessitate another increase, and so on and so forth. That solves **nothing**. If you actually want Bitcoin to grow and be a benefit to the world, you have to face **reality** and not just continue trying to make day dreams come true.

BIP9 was never about allowing miners to "vote" or "decide", it was simply a mechanism to guarantee that a super majority of miners were enforcing rules to keep the risk of a chainsplit due to the dynamic of older nodes not enforcing new rules to an absolute minimum. In no way was it designed or intended to give miners decision making or voting power.

No, the community isn't stopping the scaling conversation with this victory. And if you are referring to Segwit2x, I do not see that as a victory, I see it as a political move by the big problem child here (Jihan), to try to push Core developers out of the ecosystem and prevent these upgrades from happening. He by my assessment has no interest in scaling Bitcoin, in the sense of maintaining its decentralization and ability to verify, he simply wants to increase throughput while sacrificing all of that because he sees it as beneficial to his monopoly and control over this ecosystem.

This is completely false. It is almost unavoidable to not wind up with many different outputs as a result of transacting with Bitcoin. It is very common for users to have to spend many different outputs, resulting in transactions larger in datasize, and Schnorr would provide a very real cost savings in terms of datasize and therefore fee paid when spending many outputs. This not only saves fees for users, it makes it cheaper for outputs that are already tainted with common history to be combined for cheaper fees in future going forward without extra privacy compromises, and it also benefits businesses who cannot avoid receiving many different transactions resulting in many outputs who right now pay a disproportionately high fee to condense. This would result in a very real monetary savings both for end users and businesses.

Throughput != scaling. It scales the ability to verify the chain. Schnorr signatures in particular are one of the things on the current course that actually work to make a raw increase of the blocksize safer.

Regardless, it is not tribal or superstitious in nature. It is the result of a _reasoned and intellectual assessment_ of a platform. I follow/own a number of alternative currencies in this space. There are other things besides Bitcoin that provide actual efficiencies or value adds. Ethereum is not one of them. Its a *joke*.
Look at Bancor, it is clogging the network just during the presale where a small amount of early insiders in this space are buying into it.

You are equivocating a group pushing for the activation of such a mechanism with wide support to yourself and others who have attempted to push changes that **drastically** alter the way in which anyone can interact with Bitcoin. This is an insane conflation.

Its a new algorithm for signing transactions. Right now, when you construct a Bitcoin transaction _every single input_(UTXO going into it) has to have its own signature, which is about 60% of the data in a transaction. This new algorithm will allow signatures to be compressed into one signature, that because of the mathematical way Schnorr works, will still be verifiable as a valid signature. So now instead of requiring 100 signatures for a transactions with 100 inputs, you just require one, resulting in an insane efficiency in the data size of a transaction(and therefore the fee it pays). 
Thats also just the first step, potentially it could be possible going forward to have a single signature _per block_ for all transactions using this scheme. Resulting in a space savings for the _entire block_ as well a huge efficiency gain for any full node operating, as the signature load they have to validate when bootstrapping from the time period Schnorr becomes heavily used, and when receiving current blocks in real time.

A multitude of reasons. 
* 1) The entire social media space is on fire with it, presenting itself as "Bitcoin killer". This has to be contrasted to Bitcoin's presence on mainstream social media such as Facebook, which is essentially either Bitcoin Meetup pages, or outright scams such as "Increase your Bitcoin 10x guaranteed in blah blah!" This is a very skewed perception, but a common one because of the network effect of large social media platforms. 
* 2) These ICOs are going insane, both pumping themselves and locking up ETH off the market creating a scarcer supply for the demand they are themselves bringing into the space. Bitcoin got many early people very rich, and most "normies" decided they missed the boat. The wide range of claims of what Ethereum can do(without any technical understanding in most people's cases, or the appreciation of why most other used things aren't designed that way), plus the recent rapid price rise, plus the entire ICO mania makes Ethereum look like the boat they can still hop on with the added bonus of internal ICO tokens to continue making profit, this feeds into itself.
* 3) Ethereum has a gigantic media presence, PR professionals, and is in and of itself using that to indirectly portray Bitcoin as non-functional or riddled with problems(its not, its just getting more expensive to use, literally any blockchain token will have this happen as its price rises drastically), and this creates a very effectively reinforced skewed narrative comparing Bitcoin/Ethereum that a large number of new people coming into the space are met with.
