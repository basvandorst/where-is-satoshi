I don't think so.  New money coming in has no idea which alt to buy but knows bitcoin.  Even veteran investors aren't sure which alt horse to back.  You also start to realize that they all get pumped and dumped so bad and that even with their promises of smooth transactions, there is no adoption yet so they're basically worthless penny stocks.  Besides alts are getting rekt way harder than bitcoin right now and people tired of getting burned by alts might just decide to go back to bitcoin

I wish there were a wallet/exchange/payment processor where you hold bitcoin, but when you want to spend it, will automatically do an atomic swap for whichever coin is cheapeast and fastest at the moment, and then swap back to bitcoin on the merchant's end

So transactions keep getting broadcast and don't get dropped and refunded to the original wallet after 14 days?  That actual is scarier.  If the fee is too low you just lose your money to the abyss?

Tried this.  I sold all my bitcoin to "rebuy at the bottom."  Just so happened, where I sold WAS the bottom.  It's hard to tell sometimes with bitcoin.  Price shot up quickly.  I had to come up with additional fiat to rebuy and still have never recovered my original stack to this day.

If you invested $50k "several months ago" its value would be at $150k by almost any estimation.
You recently put $150k and took about a 25% loss so that would be $112,500
$150,000 plus $112,500 equals $262,500

And anyone whose been bitcoining for any significant period of time doesn't FOMO or panic like this.  And besides he would still be in the profits by my estimation.  Honestly it sounds like a no-coiner's imagination of what we all must be going through right now.

When I first bought, $8000 USD/BTC seemed like a HUGE milestone.  I vowed to sell 1/4 of my holdings.   When that number rolled around, I realized I wanted more bitcoin, not less.
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:54:27
In all seriousness, using bitcoin directly as a merchant payment or peer-to-peer payment is expensive and slow right now.
Lightning Network is in development to address these problems.
There are still ways to use bitcoin in the meantime.  Overstock purchases from Coinbase=no fees.  If your merchant/friend and you both have Coinbase, you can send off-chain transactions for no fees.  You can use the Shift Visa debit card linked to Coinbase for (AFAIK) no miner fees
@_date: 2017-12-05 23:27:47
No its not for trading Bitcoin itself, its going to be for futures and derivatives trading.

Coinbase to my knowlege has not said whether they will supprt this coin.  I would imagine that IF this coin actually gains any widespread support, Coinbase would be pressured by its customers/threatened with lawsuits to release the coins

I am 99% certain that Coinbase will credit you your BCH in January even though you moved your BTC off the exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:13:44
If you used Coinbase email option it's an off-chain transaction so you don't have to pay miner fees
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:10:49
They use Korean exchanges
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:19:41
Yes they're getting stuck because you need to double check what fees they are using, I've found they are way too low lately.  If something is really stuck you can wait 14 days for the transaction to be canceled or if its a large transaction you're nervous about you can use a pay accelerator or take your chances on ViaBTC free accelerator

This is not true.  We had a dip recently to $5500 which took place overnight and was back to $7500 the next morning.  I did exactly the strategy you described and got completely screwed
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:13:44
It might seem like BCH has solved a problem by increasing block size but as block size goes up so does mining centralization (miners will eventually need $100,000 equipment as Craig Wright himself has suggested).  Fewer miners means there fewer key actors and the possibility of an attack hijacking the entire blockchain and possibly stealing huge amounts of bitcoin from the blockchain.
Also increasing block size alone will never scale to handle to tranactions at the levels of something like Visa.
Bitcoin Devs are thinking on those types of scales with 2nd layer solutions
Also BCH and its founders have done numerous sketchy things to attack/sabotage Bitcoin that would be illegal if the markets were regulated.

Many of the same people who own Bitcoin own BCH because of the fork.  Coinbase kept its customers BCH hostage and then apparently  allowed its employees to have a free-for-all manipulating the market and profiting before trading was enabled for the rest of us.  The world HAS been kept in the dark about BCH trading on Coinbase.  We knew BCH would be released but they never said if full trading would be supported.

Don't try to send from Breadwallet right now.  They are not estimating fees properly and your bitcoin is almost guaranteed to be stuck for 2 weeks..Edit: I just checked again and the fees seem slighty more accurate but you must use Priority and still be prepared to wait hours or days
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:04:41
Ugh thank God I got off of Facebook
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:05:01
Because Bread is estimating fees way too low.  Something is wrong when the "Priority" fee is 30 sat/byte with no option to change it.  I had $6000 stuck in mempool because of that shit.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:55:33
I lost half my stash once trying to do what your talking about so it might seem easy to predict the top and buy the bottom but in reality it often backfires.  Also you need to have a reserve of fiat when making these plays and hope that after a year you've had more wins than losses.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:32:49
Agreed.  430sat/byte fees right now is ridic.   Can they just call an emergency protocol change to soft fork a blocksize increase even just temporary?  Something needs to relieve the pressure and there seems to be no end in sight.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:50:59
I used this site called bitcoin.tax and it imports data from your cryto accounts, and calculates your capital gains using first in-first out.  Took 5 minutes.  Not sure if it will work with Shift but if it does it could very easily sort through the mess
@_date: 2017-12-11 17:46:18
You can keep small amounts on Coinbase in my opinion.  Over $1000 I'd probably look into better storage.  In the meantime Coinbase claims to be fully insured on their holdings and keeps them in cold storage.  The reason people send coins to GDAX is that it's free to send them there, and from GDAX its free to send to a wallet or to sell them with a limit order.  Its a way of avoiding Coinbase's fees

Bitcoin cash could run into problems down the road...when Bitcoin works out its scaling issues then Bitcoin Cash won't have any real advantage other than a vanity coin for white paper purists.

There is nothing he could have possibly done on Coinbase to make 7x his investment overnight.

Yes you can just sell on Coinbase.  A limit order is when instead of buying/selling at the current price, you set a price you're hoping to get in the future.  Like I might put a sell order in for $19,500 so whenever it hits, even if I'm asleep, my bitcoin will sell at that price

I hope devs and blockstream recognize that we are in an emergency situation right now.  Satoshi himself was fine with increasing block size when warranted.

Fiat is worth less as each year passes and wages are staying the same.  A family earning $45,000 a year used to be able to purchase a home hahaha try doing that now.  Bitcoin is a way to keep your money out of the grip of inflation.  Also, you may feel your money is safe in the bank but it's a house of cards, hopefully nothing will crash it but real estate, stocks, everything is in a bubble right now and another 2008 is ripe to happen again.  We avoided disaster last time because of government borrowing...can we avoid it indefinitely?  Finally, you might think it's free to pay using a credit card but the business has to pay 3.5% of every transaction to Visa or Mastercard.  The goal of bitcoin is to get these transaction fees to be a tiny fraction of that.
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:02:34
It's not an altered version, Satoshi himself limited the blocksize to 1 MB in order to secure the network from spam and other attacks.  He did this after the white paper.  The code was never meant to be permanently fixed but rather developed over time.  Of course Satoshi did say the blocks could be made bigger in the future.  But the reason Bitcoin is by definition the real Bitcoin and not an alt is because it is the main, longest chain
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:25:18

If you start moving it into wallets etc you will incur those kinds of fees.  If you just leave it on the exchange you will only get the exchange's fee when you sell.  I just checked mine (Coinbase) and to sell $100 in bitcoin, the fee is $2.99

I'm definitely intrigued as well.  Company seems very legit and had to pass intense scrutiny with federal government.  Check about taxes though bc it seems the real benefit in these is using a Roth IRA not a 401k.  I might be wrong though.  Anyway there's a podcast where the founder is interviewed and it's definitely worth listening to if you haven't already.

1) Premium fee: coinbase adds a premium charge to the current rate of bitcoin
2)Credit card/debit card fee (around 2.5%) charged by coinbase
3) Bitcoin transaction fee as estimated by Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:26:23
Try this.  I have used it and can confirm it works.  Via BTC is a mining pool that has been critical of fees and transaction times and as a protest/gesture, they have a free service to accelerate 100 transactions per hour into the very next block they mine.  There's a ton of people trying to do this right now so it's like a lottery but worth a shot.  You have to hit it at the exact second at the top of the hour :00

You could just hold it and see.  Any big announcement or pump could send it much higher.  We've seen it shoot up to 3200 , double what it is now, bitcoin would have to hit $22k to double.   Coinbase might support it, some big merchant could announce acceptance any day, and even futures are being discussed.  I can't stand them.  But if there's money to be made, why not?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:05:45
I have the same situation.  Throughout the year I've sold in and out of bitcoin and alts.  On paper I made a fiat profit but in actuality I have no fiat to show for it bc it's all reinvested in crypto.  My understanding is that every sell is a taxable event IF you go into fiat, even if you turn around and reinvest in crypto.  But if you stay out of fiat and use a crypto trading pair (BCH&gt;LTC) then that would not be taxed?  I'm a little fuzzy on this too.
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:17:14
Well, I don't have much faith in any other place to put my money right now.  When I hold fiat I have to worry about everything the politicians are doing, the strength of the dollar, the economy etc.  Same with stocks, real estate...almost everything.  With bitcoin I can keep my money there and rise above the worries of the world.  If only we could get rid of the politics of bitcoin...

If he does not set high enough fees then yes the transaction could take days or weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:48:24
If you have any change from the transaction remaining in your breadwallet, you can try sending another small transaction, to the exact same address as the first, and this time select priority fee, and maybe those 2 will get lumped together and someone will mine it.  I'm not positive it will work but it's something else to try.

I checked my handy bitcoin fees app.  
Right now to get into the next block (&lt;30 min) you'd need to set a fee of 640sat/byte.  
At 150 sat/byte, your transaction would be processed in the next 3-35 blocks and could take up to 6 hours.
If you remember, could you update us on how long it ended up taking?

@_date: 2017-12-20 15:07:56
Right now it is pretty hard to transact in bitcoin.  It just is.  And it will cost a lot of time and money for the privilege.  I use it when I can on Overstock, and I accept it for my local business (no takers) but I'm not going to stress about it.  I'm not a full-time bitcoin activist and if that's what is expected of the everyday consumer, that is a big demand.  Either it will gain adoption because businesses have a reason to, or it won't.

Fees were probably set too low and it's not getting confirmed.  You could wait it out or try to take other steps to accelerate the transaction.  It's not a Coinbase issue but a blockchain issue

Oh shoot.  I think I did have to try a few times.  Well after 14days the transaction will get dropped and go back to your wallet.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:01:21
I had 2 not moving, had to use an accelerator after 24 hours.  Bread estimated way too low for the fees (less than 30sat/byte). I wanted to send more but every time I tried, Bread was putting incorrect fees at one point even &lt;0.00000001 at that point I gave up

I thought the transaction dropped after 2 weeks and the btc balance is restored to your wallet.  Why is yours stuck in mempool for 3 weeks?  You're scaring me bc I have money tied up in the mempool right now and I thought it would be released if no confirms for 14 days
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:36:15
Agreed.  Fees are an emergency situation right now.  They need to make an emergency decision, even if temporary.  I'm tempted to switch coins because all my gains mean ZILCH if they're stuck in the mempool
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:16:06
The mining pool ViaBTC offers a free accelerator service but you have to have at least 10sat/byte fee (hopefully no wallet would have dared go lower than that) and you have to be the first 100 every hour so submit at :00 on the dot

Next time you send from one Coinbase acct to another Coinbase acct, use the email option.  The transaction is off-chain and the funds are simply transferred via Coinbase's internal database.  I think it's free

That attitude that everything is fine, and that we should consider other alts, that is what worries me.  I wish the devs felt the same sense of urgency as the people out there trying to send bitcoin right now and getting their transactions stuck.  The average bitcoin user right now has to be savvy enough to recognize that their wallet is underestimating fees (because they are).  This is not just noobs but anyone who hasn't sent bitcoin in a while.  Then the user has to try importing their bitcoin to a different wallet that allows fee customization (and supports Segwit).  Then the user has to research the current fee estimations.  Only then can they safely send bitcoin without risking losing it indefinitely in the mempool.  That is a big ask.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:20:55

@_date: 2017-12-10 18:39:55
Another thing I've noticed is people recommending alts to noobs, and being disparaging about transaction times and fees and cautioning against buying bitcoin at the moment.  This is definitely new.  I guess with higher prices come higher risks and people are more fearful.  But I very much miss the positive energy from earlier this year.  I hope the noobs don't get scared off :-)
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:12:35
It actually makes more sense in this crazy time to keep funds on Coinbase.  You can make peer-to-peer payments from one Coinbase user to another with no network fees, using email addresses.  You can buy things from Overstock using Coinbase with no fees.  If you do ever want to send your bitcoin to your personal wallet, send it from Coinbase to Gdax to your wallet.  Those are some ways to keep fees down while this all gets sorted out
@_date: 2017-12-18 11:08:36
All of them have to do with the exact location on the blockchain of where your bitcoin is.  The public key allows other people to send you bitcoin to that location.  It is like a long, complicated, and more precise version of your bitcoin address.  The private key is a long complicated version of your sending address, which allows you to access your coins.  The seed is like your password that allows you to recover your bitcoin from that location on the blockchain, even if you lose your wallet, or anything else.  It's a string of words.  The words seem random but they actually are also derived from the coirdinates of your bitcoin's location
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:38:47
My advice based on experience, buy back in asap and sleep well at night

Have you considered that maybe they were't rich until they bought bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:27:40
i'm pretty sure it's ok.  I think the balance got "deleted" because it was technically part of that $20 transaction (it was the change or output) but these things can't be undone on the blockchain, it's just not showing in your wallet.  When the transaction either gets confirmed or finally cancelled on the blockchain, I'm pretty sure you should see the full balance restored on your wallet (possibly need to resync it or something) but this is just my theory, no first-hand knowlege

If they can get the fees in check, I see real use cases all the time. 
Like this true story that happened to me today:  My son has an ususual name.  I tried to send money to a friend using Venmo.  I used my son's name as the title of the transaction.  I got flagged as suspicious and Venmo is sending me emails wanting to know what my son's name means and what is my intention for sending the money.  Their investigation of the issue will be complete in 48 hours.  
I know I sound like Roger Ver but when people are censored and treated like criminals for trying to send their own money peer-to-peer, it makes you realize just one of the key benefits of using bitcoin.
I could give other examples but that's for another storytime
@_date: 2017-12-25 18:53:22
Hmmm maybe!  But I think when an exchange lumps withdrawals they are already in possession of a large sum ie the entire input and they previously had already received it in a large lump as well (one output) so having a bunch of people sending a bunch of smaller transactions would still have high fees even if sent in a batch
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:22:30

Honestly, it's because Bitcoin is Coca Cola.  Somewhere out there, there are drinks that taste better.  But everyone loves Coca Cola. From there it snowballs.  Big money wants a piece of you.  Developers want to work with you.  Brands want to co-opt you.  And bitcoin earned its value the real way.  For every dollar of its current value, real people bought and sold and mined their asses off.  Any ICO or alt coin can be created out of thin air.  They can claim a market share but it's not real.  Whereas every penny of bitcoin's market share was earned by being a true industry mover.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:24:14

Lots of similar regret stories.  In fact I'd say the majority of bitcoiners have regrets bc honestly only the foolhardy would have gone all-in on something so risky.  The cure is starting now.

The easiest way for me to think about it, which is not the most simplified equation, but first find out what fraction of a bitcoin you would own.  If you buy 500 worth at 20,000 then 500/20,000=0.025 bitcoin.  You can then take that 0.025 and multiply it by any price to find out what you'd have.  0.025 x $50,000 = $1250
I don't think you're dumb but I do think there are serious problems with the way math is getting taught these days...this should be 8th grade level stuff.  My son is struggling too and so are the kids at the school I susbtitute at.  The funny thing is it's HARDER these days but kids are learning LESS.  It's fucked up
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:25:29
I mean its kinda shitty math.  Basically if you started the year with $1000 in bitcoin and it went up 1000% you now have $10,000 in gains.  All it takes is a 40% drop to erase $4000.  That is the equivalent of 400% gains on your original $1000.
If bitcoin had gone up 10,000% (!) in a year then a 40% drop would equal a 4000% gain.
TLDR:  Drops hurt
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:31:47
There are no U.S. laws against bitcoin.  No one is going to freeze your account.  If your bank doesn't accept your cash withdrawals from a bitcoin exchange, open an account at a bank that will.

I mean the whole idea seems kinda silly unless the plan is that we rely on hubs that streamline the process for us or if your balance on say Coinbase can be used on thousands of online retailers because Coinbase has opened channels with them

I can't watch the video right now but I tend to agree. The move from like 8500 to 19800 was so fast we never really tested support for any of these numbers.  It's like the market is now taking a pause to determine where its true value is.  I think the fact that it's hovering around $14,000 is pretty fucking good all things considered
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:24:02

Moving around BTC for a lateral trade is not the most economical right now.  You could have bought Litecoin and sent it to Kraken for way cheaper.  You would need to actually sell the Litecoin for USD and then buy the coin you want

You have not lost $300.  You only lose if you sell.  It's going back up anyway.  Bitcoin is a complete rollercoaster.  Practically every person that ever bought saw the price go down just like you.

I just bought a little today because I am not yet done accumulating the amount I would like to have.  The plan was to wait for a big dip (2000s?) but I had the money now and bitcoin is as good a place as any to put it.  Last price I bought at was 1850 so it doesn't feel great to spend this much but at the same time it's a relief to just be done with it and not have to walk around with my finger on the trigger
@_date: 2017-08-12 15:14:20
Coinbase charges you $50 more per bitcoin than the market rate.  When you sell they give you $50 less than the market rate.  This charge is known as a "premium." It is in addition to any actual transaction fees that they charge.
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:14:58
It will take time but it will happen.  You say people are operating fine without it.  Right now business owners are paying credit card companies 3% on transactions.  With bitcoin, transactions would cost just pennies.  That's just one small example.  I remember in the 90's when everyone was minding their own business doing just fine without cell phones!
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:35:46
There's nothing wrong with your rationale I'll say that.  Some people argue against trading, period.  But if you're the trading type and you have enough bitcoin to play with some of it, planning to sell between 4000-4500 is probably not a bad play.
@_date: 2017-08-08 01:38:17

I don't know but I'm taking what they say very seriously.  They were eerily accurate about the last 2 price swings.  I'm not going to do anything drastic but I will definitely be planning to buy the dip.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:28:21
If you buy in small increments, it can make your average cost per bitcoin go down.  So if you buy now, at 3200/bitcoin, and you buy more next week, it might be 2800/bitcoin, and the week after that, maybe it's 3000/bitcoin, your average is 3000/bitcoin, vs putting it all in right now at 3200.  Of course if it goes only higher from here you would wish you'd bought it all now.  But let's face it, bitcoin usually goes down after it goes up.
@_date: 2017-08-13 12:27:53

I would gladly spend bitcoin but most of my money goes to groceries, electricity, and home payments, not to plane tickets and online shopping.  Once there is a way for me to put all my monthly funds into bitcoin and pay bills and groceries out of it, I will.

Yes just make sure you consider the transaction fees, trading premiums and interest rate of the credit card.  Price of bitcoin would have to more than double to get your $50 profit.
@_date: 2017-08-14 12:34:53
For a small operation shipping will eat you alive.  All you can do is shop for the very lowest rate available and modify your size and weight to be the lowest you can.  Add that into the price of your box so the customer gets free shipping.  That means you may need to charge more for your box.  You may need to add a few more low-cost trinkets to the box to instill value.
If you can somehow let another large vendor like Amazon drop-ship to your customers (with free shipping) that is the best way to go.  So basically a customer orders a box from you, you order all the items from Amazon (make sure you specify that they come in one box) and have Amazon ship to your customer for free.  Select "this is a gift" so that the customer will not get an invoice in the box.  You may want yo try getting an order sent to yourself first so you can make sure it's in an unmarked box, but even if it comes in an Amazon box most customers are ok with it surprisingly.  They expect many vendors also sell on or with Amazon
Good luck

Lol good one!  Yep I recently had to pay $40 to send $1200.  It was a 3.5% fee to make a credit card payment.  In several states this practice is illegal.  Businesses are supposed to be the ones paying those fees and not the consumers.

I think those that are sitting on the sidelines panicking about missing out should just buy SOMETHING even if it's like $50 worth.  I think it would alleviate some of the angst.  Meanwhile save up cash and wait for a buying opportunity that feels right to you
@_date: 2017-08-16 10:50:03
If you sold and bought back at the same price you did not lose gains.  Your net is the exact same (minus transaction fees).  So I'd say you got off pretty easy!  After a while you don't get freaked out over big dips.  They happen all the time and bitcoin always bounces back.  You'll get to where the dips excite you because you can buy cheap bitcoin.  Good luck!
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:06:15
Aim for a quarter of a bitcoin.  It's a round enough number.  Even if you have "one bitcoin" all it takes is having to move it around a few times to no longer have "one."  It's arbitrary.  Pick smaller fractions to be your goal.

Any major sell-off could go south very quickly.  Just because bitcoin is trading at 4200 right now, does not mean that every one of our bitcoins is worth 4200.  It means the latest bitcoin sold for that amount.  If a lot of people tried to sell at once we would very quickly see that there is not enough cash to actually cover everyone's coins.
Also if governments come up with a way to shut it down.

It's just a bitcoin commemorative token.  There is no value.  A few years ago a company was actually selling bitcoin tokens that had a code on them for a real bitcoin, but the government shut it down.  So if you ever find one of those they are highly valuable.  Occasionally people also buy these commemorative ones and put their own keys on them to make them "worth" a bitcoin.  But yours does not seem to have that.

Wow you have friends that know about bitcoin?  Lucky!  lol
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:29:03
It can be as easy or as complicated or as you want it to.  All you really have to do is go to Coinbase and buy bitcoin.  Done.  They will store them for you and you can theoretically stop there.  But if you want to securely store them yourself, then you take the next step.  There are free apps such as breadwallet for storage.
@_date: 2017-08-15 13:37:52
Whenever it climbs really fast it's more likely to fall fast too.  Afterall it more than doubled in a month.  Corrections are normal, and good for the longterm

@_date: 2017-08-13 14:10:37
Recently I had to pay an invoice for $5400 and the business I was making the payment to charged me a 3.5% fee to pay online using a credit or debit card.  That is nearly $200 just to make a payment.  That made me realize that there is a whole industry making profits off of other people transferring money to one another.  Using bitcoin eliminates that need.  I think the fee to send that payment in bitcoin would have been maybe $15
@_date: 2017-08-19 12:40:32
Personally I think this is a sign of strength on bitcoin's part.  There is a pump and dump probably going on where big holders of BCH have coordinated to sell their BTC and move it to BCH to inflate the price, which has succeeded.  But also there is uncertainty with Segwit 2 lock-in a few days away, some less than stellar analysis released by Goldman Sachs and a terrorist attack in Barcelona.  So given all this chaos, to be holding above $4000 I think is a very positive sign!
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:37:16

You said you could take the money and throw it away and it will make no difference in your life and that to me is a great attitude and situation to buy bitcoin.  As far as whether it will come down from $4000 for a better price?  Maybe.  I wouldn't obsess over it though.  You have all the time in the world to let it sit and build value
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:10:11

Can't manipulate the market without first buying a bunch of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-15 01:24:05
Well they have a lot of work to do as far as marketing.  Bitcoin was lightyears further in terms of global acceptance by the time it traded for $1300 USD/BTC.  BCH marketing efforts will also be in a race against time with lightning network and Segwit adoption. What advances has BCH made in terms of acceptance?  Overstock accepts BCH?  I just went on Overstock and there was no option to pay with any crypto but Bitcoin.  I read that Overstock is going to start accepting payments from Shapeshift.io which includes several alts, not exclusively BCH, and those alts will be immediately converted to BTC for Overstock to receive and then Overstock hodls 40-50% of their bitcoin so the buck still stops with bitcoin.  Bcash seems like just another alt to me and an expensive one at that.
@_date: 2017-11-05 15:12:24
You're going to get mixed responses here because some of the bitcoin purists believe it defeats the purpose of decentralization to let a big exchange handle your bitcoin for you.  And it's not really a good platform for frequent trading.  But for a noob who just wants to buy and hold, I think it's probably one of the best options.  They make it really easy and intuitive to buy, sell and store, and if you are an average user, they are probably more secure than anything you can rig up yourself.  Once you're ready to get more hands-on you can always move your coins somewhere else down the road.

Not sure if I have the expertise to answer but my understanding is that Breadwallet was going to follow the chain with the majority of the signaling, whichever coin that happens to be, 99% chance it will be bitcoin.  Coinbase on the other hand has said it will recognize the new forked coin in addition to bitcoin, and credit it to their customers to do with it as they please
EDIT ok so they're honoring both coins...I'm still moving to Coinbase because it will be immediate, Bread may take awhile

@_date: 2017-11-21 01:23:25
They are just shady as fuck in every way.  Instead of developing a new coin to stand on its own merits, they hijacked the real Bitcoin.  And now they actively promote the death of original bitcoin.  Their founders are sketchy people, they are willing to throw down big money to profit from BCH in ways that would be illegal in a regulated market.   They pay shills to infiltrate social media, and they use Bitcoin.com to drive business toward BCH and they have even hacked reddit accounts to promote their cause.
@_date: 2017-11-10 21:07:40
The way I see it is it's up to individual companies to streamline their services regarding bitcoin.  If there's a need for something the market will respond.  Maybe there needs to be a company that provides technical support for bitcoin users for a snall fee.  Maybe a company is needed that makes it easier for businesses to accept bitcoin by placing scanners at the register so you merely flash your barcode.  Etc.  I think these things will happen organically
@_date: 2017-11-21 19:48:06
I very painfully bought today after finally concluding there's not going to be a significant dip that I can foresee anytime soon.  It hurts because I had bought in early in the year...and stupidly sold a few weeks ago hoping to get back in cheaper.  Instead, I now have to rebuy a fraction of what I once had...and now I'm spending significant money as opposed to a fun bet.  It is very hard, but as implausible as $32,000USD/BTC seems, so did $8000 not very long ago
@_date: 2017-11-05 12:27:17
My plan all along was to sell 25% when it hits 8000.  However now that we're almost there, I might just keep holding.  I honestly don't know where else to invest money right now.  I'd probably turn right around and put it back in bitcoin lol
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:44:56

You don't need to store USD on Coinbase.  As long as you have a bank account linked you can buy instantly at the price you want.

Bitcoin was Bitcoin for 8 years and is the one you hear about in the news.  Bitcoin Cash was a group of very rich, very vocal investors who decided to split off and make a new coin, Bitcoin Cash, about 3 months ago.  Bitcoin Cash is supposed to make transactions cheaper and faster than Bitcoin by increasing the size of blocks in the blockchain.  This has the unintended (or possibly very much intended) side effect of benefiting a select few of the very largest mining operations (mainly in China) and forces miners to buy special equipment that also benefits, surprise, one of the biggest Bitcoin Cash supporters.  So far, it is very hard to buy and spend Bitcoin Cash since it has not caught on, so being able to transact with it, is kind of irrelevent anyway.  Meanwhile normal Bitcoin continues to develop improvements (Lightning Network, SegWit) that are hoping to make transacting cheaper and faster 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:01:12
These derivatives are bought and paid out in cash.  Real bitcoins are not changing hands.  However, if someone like a hedge fund wanted to influence the bitcoin market price in order to profit from their derivatives bets, then they can do that, so the price might become volatile.  But they would have to have those bitcoins first

You should get an email confirmation from Coinbase and the transaction should appear in your BTC Wallet on Coinbase.  If not I guess contact customer support
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:01:08
Coinbase is fine to store your coins for now.  They keep their coins offline so they can't be hacked, and they are insured.  You're only going to lose more bitcoin transferring to a wallet in these small increments.  If I were you I'd accumulate more and send it all at once to a wallet down the road.  It will save you a lot of fees.  
If you have an iphone, Breadwallet is a free downloadable mobile wallet that I have had good experiences with.  Very intuitive.
To move coins, there is a SEND button on Coinbase.  It will ask for a wallet address to send to.  You enter the address that your wallet generates for you when you hit RECEIVE on the wallet app
That's my 2 cents.  I'm not very techy so I stick to mainstream products that are easy to use.

For that large of an amount you might want to use a consultant that can help you navigate, figure out a security plan and a succession plan.  Your most basic steps are buying the bitcoin from an exchange, and sending it to a hardware wallet which you'll need to purchase and install (Trezor, Ledger).  They are sort of like a flash drive but they store your private keys to your bitcoin.

A few years back, someone made a legendary post to r/bitcoin.  It made the front page of r/all and I think it became the highest rated bitcoin post ever.  It's basically a free-wheeling rant about why he's shamelessly decided to hold his bitcoin.  This was at a time when a lot of folks were starting to become traders...but not this guy.  He's decided to hodl!  (He was drunk as he typed).  Even with all the mispellings and obvious inebriation, his words resonated with many people and became kind of an anthem to all those "hodlers" out there.

It's like buying stock in a company that holds bitcoin.  For every share the company owns 1/10 of a bitcoin so as you can see, it costs more than actually owning bitcoin.

2 different things.  Coinbase is a big exchange with a lot of traffic so compared to other exchanges they sometimes trade higher because demand is slightly skewed toward Coinbase.  The other difference you see between the market price and what Coinbase charges, is because they tack on a premium charge of $25-100 bias points above the market price.  That is how they earn their money for the service they provide

They charge a fee AND they charge a premium.  The premium means they add $25-$100 onto the current price of a bitcoin when you buy.  When you sell, they subtract $25-$100 off the current price
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:08:46
I wouldn't sell.  I sold during the recent BCH attack and then the price shot up and I never was able to recover my same amount of bitcoin.  I wouldn't wish this feeling on anyone.  If you think holding bitcoin is stressful, try not holding it, while watching the train leave you behind

A group of people unhappy with the direction Bitcoin was taking split away from Bitcoin and formed Bitcoin Cash.
It just so happens that one of these dissenters owns Bitcoin.com
So the Bitcoin.com website is being used to equally promote both the original Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash (the forked coin)
The original bitcoin is the one everyone is talking about.  Bitcoin cash is trying to be a version of bitcoin that is better for spending every day.  Only problem is, as of right now, there's no where to really spend it.

That is crazy.  I hope you recover your coins.  Can someone explain this scam to me so I can watch out for it (assuming it is a scam)?
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:39:55
No one thinks it a coinbase special offer, everyone understands that you get the forked coin if you hold bitcoin during the split, but it is a matter of how soon you can safely split the coin yourself (besides not everyone has the comfort level to do that)
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:54:57
You're going to be charged the price of what bitcoin was trading at the time you clicked the BUY button several days ago.  They will probably not let you out of this transaction, you can only cancel within the first 30 minutes of placing your order.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:59:42
It's called a premium.  They charge above market price when you buy, and give you below market price when you sell.  I thought the premium was $50 in each direction but maybe they went up :-(
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:16:55
I would think BCH would still be there in your breadwallet.  Go to settings&gt;advanced&gt;withdraw BCH and see if your balance is there

I think helping new people get started is a nice thing to do.  It's not like they can call "bitcoin customer support" and it's not exactly intuitive how and where to buy bitcoin.  If you wanted a credit card you'd know to call Visa.  Noobs don't know which exchanges are the Visa and which are the Mt Gox's.  It's those simple things and there's always someone happy to help them out on here which I think is good.  If anything there should be a sticky thread daily for newbie questions but not an outright ban.

I have a sales and marketing background so I'd do something like this:  First I'd start with one category, say, pubs.  Send a letter letting them know, briefly, why they should consider accepting bitcoin.  Remember businesses only care about benefits to them.  What are the benefits?  No fees (bc customer pays them).  No investement or equipment required.  Virtually risk-free.  Competitive advantage.  Attract an educated, young, hip crowd.  Then, follow up the letter with a phone call.  Offer to come in person and show them how to get started.  Offer to bring promotional materials (a window sign etc.) and free staff training.  Lastly offer to host a bitcoin launch event at their location.

I'm just seeing a lot more fear on these forums and a lot of reposts of negative opinions by "experts" and a lot of TA proclaiming we're in for a bloodbath.

I would love that.  They would pay the fees, not me (right?)  and I would not have to pay premiums to an exchange.  It would automatically dollar-cost-average for me.  But I would need to be able to use bitcoin for my expenses.  I can't afford to always be hodling my pay.

Coinbase is pretty safe in my opinion.  They actually insure their bitcoin so even if they get hacked, their customers will get their money back.  They keep something like 98% of their bitcoin off-line so it can't be stolen.  Down the line you'll probably want to look into storing your own bitcoin but for a first timer with $500, Coinbase is a good option.
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:07:30
I think that issue can be addressed down the line.  Of more concern in the immediate future is making movement of bitcoin faster, cheaper, and easier.  Bitcoin probably also could use a (decentralized of course) IT industry.  This in turn will lead to wider acceptance.  With wider acceptance there will then come a need for a more user-friendly terminology, although, I'd argue, if grown adults can't wrap their heads around decimal places, maybe bitcoin will never be for them no matter what!

Having lived through another bubble, housing, here is what I remember.  
LOTS of regular folks getting a second mortgage on their homes because home prices were "guaranteed" to go up.  I don't see too many people putting up their homes for bitcoin.
People quitting high-paying jobs every day to go flip houses.  Not seeing a whole lot of normies quitting their day jobs for bitcoin.
Multiple reality TV series dedicated to houseflipping and the easy money to be made.  Shows about bitcoin=zero.
Everyone buying way more house than they could afford, because in 2 years someone else will come buy it for 50% more.  I don't see too many bitcoin enthusiasts going into massive debts over bitcoin.

Finally they weren’t satisfied with my ability to answer all their questions.  So now I have to show up in person with 2 years worth of returns, W2s and all documents, 2 forms of id.
I asked why I was being put through all this.  They said “something changed between your previous years and this one and it raised concerns.

@_date: 2017-07-31 11:34:42
I'm assuming your bitcoin is in a Coinbase vault and that's why you can't get to it?
If you have no choice then you can try just hodling on Coinbase.  They have said they might consider adopting BCH if it starts taking off as a legitimate cryptocurrency, and in that case they have said they would credit their customers their BCH.  Of course you are leaving it up to Coinbase to make that determination and follow through with it.

If they would give everyone the bitcoin cash they are entitled to there would not be this insane rush
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:33:04
Took 13 hours for mine
@_date: 2017-07-29 16:29:02
They generate new addresses for each transaction but the old ones still work
@_date: 2017-07-29 15:25:19
There are free apps you can download on your phone.  Breadwallet is one.  You can use it to both store and buy bitcoin.  I haven't used it to a actually buy bitcoin so I can't tell you what the fees are.  For storage it's pretty easy though, just download the app to your phone, once you sign in, it will show you an address to recieve bitcoin.  Then go to coinbase and "send bitcoin" to your new wallet address.  If you are planning to get bitcoin off coinbase you should do it asap 12+ hour transaction times
@_date: 2017-06-30 02:59:20
Hopefully bitcoin didn't read the book
@_date: 2017-07-29 17:12:42
Latest transaction times sending from coinbase wallet are reported as 12-15 hours.  That keeps you within comfortable window before Aug 1
Unless you use coinbase vault?  Might be too late
@_date: 2017-07-25 21:01:21
Just be aware that the exchanges will charge a premium and a fee on trades that will quickly eat up your profits, when you're dealing with that low of amounts...
@_date: 2017-06-17 00:58:34
Yes I think it will touch $3000 again before July.  But will it break thru?  Probably not. Good news is the new floor is about $2500
@_date: 2017-07-18 19:33:21
Thanks, I bought it back

Just hodl her, every relationship has its ups and downs.  She's still cool, give her a chance to show you

From reading comments on here, Coinbase seems to have trouble filling orders on days with unusually high volume or large swings in price.  Maybe try transferring cash into a USD wallet on Coinbase first and then the money is there for Bitcoin when you are ready to strike?
@_date: 2017-06-17 13:18:47
I'm a fan of hedging your bets.  If I had 5 I'd probably sell 1.  I'd either put that money in ether, stocks, or cash, but keep it ready to buy bitcoin again if it gets really cheap after Aug 1.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:14:13
I already kissed the money goodbye before I put it in
@_date: 2017-06-21 21:42:17
I'm sorry for everything you are going through.  Your post just prompted me to spend 10 minutes jotting down all my important info in the case that something should happen to me.  I hope you get those bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-06-08 12:11:39
At least the bitcoin chart for now has ceased to look *exactly* like the "stages of a bubble chart." lol
@_date: 2017-06-25 20:54:35
I have strong stomach for this generally but...couple things I see right now...start saving your cash to buy is all I'm sayin
@_date: 2017-06-28 12:30:36
Are you using a mobile device?  If so check the website on a PC.  They show more information on your transactions.  I don't *think* coinbase is scheming like that because they could get in big trouble, but I could be wrong
@_date: 2017-06-24 23:46:20
If the free market works like it should, then solutions will arise because it will be profitable to those that mine and hold bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:22:53
Interesting.  If you don't mind, what is the price it should drop to if it completes the head and shoulders curve?
@_date: 2017-06-20 22:15:01
All you can do is speculate with bitcoin because there is not enough historic performance to get accurate numbers.  But I see what you are looking for, it's a quadratic equation that will calculate the exponential growth.  If you want to assume bitcoin will double every year for example, then you say 3000 times (2 to the x power) where x is number of years.  I think!  Calculus was a long time ago.  And no there is no compound interest because unlike a retirement fund, your profits are not getting reinvested every year.  You will have the same number of bitcoins you started with
@_date: 2017-06-28 20:19:38
If people here on r/bitcoin thought it was too late, then they would be selling their own coins.  Why hold onto a loser? Instead you have a whole bunch of people hodling their coins for longterm, potentially unlimited, future gains.  Could it slow down for a while from the astronomical growth it has seen recently, sure.  But I bet it will still dwarf any other investment.  I happened to buy both bitcoin and stocks at the same time 6 weeks ago.  Since then bitcoin grew 25% and my stock portfolio 0.5%

If you were an atheist would you tell the crowd at the bapstism party?  If you were looking forward to rolling a joint would you tell your child's pre-k teacher?  If you loved punk music would you blare it in car with your regional manager?  Point is, you owe no one an explanation!
@_date: 2017-06-25 21:00:15
I hope this isn't the dreaded "head and shoulders" bc the "shoulder" goes down to around $1500 looking at May-present
@_date: 2017-06-14 21:48:53
I'd rather hodl on tight because who knows what the price will be as August 1st nears.  We could have broken past $3000 long before then.  $3000 might be the bottom of the dip for all we know, oops you just sold at $2600!  Not only that but what if the exchanges go down and you can't buy the dip.  Bottom line, I don't enjoy the idea of having to buy back what I already had in my possession, for a higher price. 
@_date: 2017-06-21 20:52:20
The only potential caveat I can see is that there are a couple scenarios where you might end up buying higher than what you sold at.  One is if the transition goes smoothly and the price actually goes up.  The other is that the price does drop but with all the chaos, the exchanges go down and you are unable to buy the dip.  The same goes with ETH, in a worst case scenario you have to buy back higher.  Not trying to tell you what to do but just be prepared that you might have to add some cash to get back where you were, in a worst case scenario 
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:31:36
Both times it neared $3000 and then it came down in a hurry.  Is it because of Chinese traders taking profits at 20,000 yuan?  Seems like that's the hump right now
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:27:25
What is it: global, digital currency. How does it work:  blockchain.  Origins: Satoshi, white papers.  Early days: developers, miners, early adopters, dark web, pizza day.  Problems along the way: silk road, mount gox.  Progress along the way: governments, banks, retailers.  Present day situation: possible hard fork in near future.  Future of Bitcoin: ???
@_date: 2017-06-10 00:59:00
Thank you for responding.  I deleted my question because I realized another commenter had already asked it, but I feel reassured with your reply.  I'll hunker down and hodl on Coinbase then.
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:29:57
They can only buy up as much bitcoin as people are willing to sell them.  It would basically drive the price of a bitcoin way up.  Average bitcoin holders would become millionaires.  The real problem would be if the banks then decide to dump it all at once. Ouch
@_date: 2017-06-21 00:13:42
If you buy right now it will probably go up as well as go down.  If you buy in a few days it will probably go up as well as go down.  lol
@_date: 2017-06-14 10:57:23
My coinbase order took over a week but I totally didn't mind.  I got to keep the money in my checking account meanwhile the price of a bitcoin went up 20% but I had already locked into a lower price, so by the time the transaction cleared I had instant equity.  If you are just HODLing it doesn't matter.
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:14:17
I've been very impressed with how they are handling this and the communication they are providing to their users
@_date: 2017-06-16 01:50:16
If you can take 2,500 right now and lose it all without really missing it, then sure, buy a bitcoin, but don't depend on it for retirement or anything.  It's just a fun bet.
@_date: 2017-06-17 01:34:03
Looks great!  Lots of new information.  Thanks
@_date: 2017-06-08 00:55:00
It's not a crash.  Just some turbulence.  It's just like the lovely plane flight that suddenly goes whoosh, but you didn't die.  Everything is fine.  Get another bloody mary
@_date: 2017-06-30 11:57:47
You are locked in at the price when you first hit the buy button regardless how long it takes for the order to be completed
@_date: 2017-06-16 11:54:55
Because if you are new to bitcoin, some of the other exchanges can be very confusing and hard to use.  Also Coinbase, even with all its customer service problems, is a reputable company.

I've never had to show ID to buy Bitcoin...wouldn't that kind of defeat the purpose?  Coinbase asks for photo ID but it's an optional security measure
@_date: 2017-06-24 22:21:47
No matter what price anyone bought in at it did the same thing...
@_date: 2017-06-10 17:32:53
No way would I sell at $5000.  I'm holding out for the cheese baby.  Not that I don't plan to sell *small* amounts at certain points that are specific to my investment.  For example I'll sell a fraction of a bitcoin when it hits $8000
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:05:30
I don't believe enough bitcoin exists in the world to saturate the market.  That is one difference between this and other bubbles.
@_date: 2017-06-30 12:11:24
No one knows for sure but the chart is indicating that we're in a for a drop.  I agree with those saying to put some in now and some later (dollar cost averaging) so that you are covered either way.  
@_date: 2017-06-17 23:04:13
About a month ago I bought my first bitcoin at around $2000.  When will I stop compulsively checking the price all day long?  I'm exhausted.
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:22:26
I may be wrong but when your friends mean "cheaper" what they really might mean is they think it has more growth potential. They see it as, well I missed out on bitcoin and here is my chance to catch the next wave.  I don't know whether or not splitting bitcoin would address the FOMO on ether
@_date: 2017-06-15 11:21:00
You misspelled hodl
@_date: 2017-06-10 11:13:59
I have to admit, watching traditional stocks plod along is suddenly extremely boring.  But the benefit is, I can control them.  I can buy and sell and keep my money safe just like taking care of a garden.  Whereas bitcoin is like a wild seed I threw into the wind!

This is a pretty good explanation: August 1st And The End Of Bitcoin? $COIN
@_date: 2017-06-09 01:42:24
The main problem I see with selling now, is that at these price increases, even the dip after the fork could be higher than where we are now.  And then what?  Now you have to rebuy your bitcoin for higher prices than you just sold it for? That's my worry.  I haven't figured out my strategy but I'm scared to sell.  I will probably just make sure I switch my holdings over to an exchange that is committed to supporting both chains after the split.  I'm not tech savvy so I am really stressing about this TBH!
@_date: 2017-06-17 12:10:26
I found a great explanation on Seeking Alpha yesterday.
August 1st And The End Of Bitcoin? $COIN
@_date: 2017-06-14 19:54:17
The website makes it very clear that you can buy any dollar amount you want.  I think your friends are aware that 1000% growth is 1000% growth whether they invest $100 or $100,000.  I think the real issue is they believe ether has higher growth potential in the short term because they feel like they're getting in on the ground floor and bitcoin is already on the 100th floor.  The real issue is whether your friends believe in bitcoin, because 100 floors is nothing compared to the moon ;-)
@_date: 2017-06-24 18:31:38
Even with these swings, by the time you pay premiums, the risk to me is definitely not worth it.  Not for bitcoin at least, because I value having it and I'd hate to lose it.
@_date: 2017-06-11 21:45:31
Sounds like they charged you the ATM fee of 8-14% as well tacked on a premium to the exchange rate.
@_date: 2017-06-06 19:14:22
