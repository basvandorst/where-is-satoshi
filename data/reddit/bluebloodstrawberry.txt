I don't understand why people want to buy coffee with Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is a store of value like gold. You don't go around with a gold bar to pay beers with your friends.
If you need speed to pay for your coffee, use another crypto. Something like Digibyte.
The high fee is high for those paying for coffee. But it's low enough for people who want to store their value in one of the safest vaults on earth.
Bitcoin Cash is a coin created right before experts knew there will be a boom on dec 2017.
They forked and created free money out of thin air for all BTC holders. It's obvious why the community agreed to fork.
BCH community is always talking about high speed and low fees compared to BTC. But there are coins doing the same thing BCH is so proud of, but much much better.
BCH is artificially created value out of thin air. It's a huge minus for the crypto world. Risking the integrity of a tech like Bitcoin is just to get richer is the most irresponsible thing a community could do

I actually find trading very interesting. I like spending time looking the charts. Bots are cool, but I'd rather trade by myself.
Maybe I would buy a bot eventually just to have another source of income
@_date: 2019-10-18 20:15:43
well yea.. you're. It change my life, but in a negative way... ..for now.
@_date: 2019-10-03 07:04:51
If I could go back to 2005, I would tell myself to not go to college, instead use the money to buy few gpu rigs and start mining Btc. 
Wait till it gets to 900$ in 2013, sell it all and go **"All in" 2014 Brasil vs Germany 1:7** betting on the right result xD
 And btw... I would tell my self to never store my BTC on exchanges. mt.gox etc...
@_date: 2019-10-18 13:02:35
Is there a 3rd stage incoming? ... just to prepare myself..
@_date: 2019-10-19 06:27:20
Yea... I've heard / read that people have trouble with bots especially in large exchanges where exchange bots are able to trade with large liquidation limits.
But in small exchanges it could actually work
@_date: 2019-10-18 12:17:55
This is exactly why I told them about Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-10-13 16:53:18
I would go for 0.6 ;)
@_date: 2019-10-19 06:21:14
hm.. thanks for the heads up!
Sounds like a cycle that we should be aware of.
You've been in the 3rd stage?
@_date: 2019-10-19 18:12:15
Well.. I deeply understand the Satoshis idea and vision.
I think I will never sell back to fiat. Even if the price falls, I will still DCA just to accumulate more. I believe in the infrastructure.
@_date: 2019-10-18 13:39:29
What means DCA?

1. If cryptography fails there are far bigger issues regarding national securities, nuclear weapons, top secret info which would be exposed. So Bitcoin is that case wouldn't be the main focus.
2. They can make it illegal like they already did in some parts of the world. So are drugs but still I see junkies walking on the street... (drugs are far easier to get off the street than bitcoin)
3. Blockchain is a technology built around a philosophy. Bitcoin doesn't depend on hype. It's price depends on hype. But the decentralized P2P electronic cash system will work even if 1 BTC cost 0.01$ like it does now when 1 BTC is 8100$. So, it's the philosophy which matters. It surely won't die.
@_date: 2019-10-14 06:32:58
Bitcoin doesn't need gas like a truck or ethereum
@_date: 2019-10-19 06:38:51
A lambo isn't what I want or need. A full fridge and not needing to go to work in the morning is the real goal. Maybe in the future a few million satoshis will help me achieve that.

Thank you man!

I just want to help friends close to me.
I know a guy who became rich with BTC that I went to college with. He never mentioned Bitcoin. I think he's not a good friend for keeping that kind of information for himself. He could change my life simply by showing me this new internet magic money, but he didn't.
@_date: 2019-10-18 13:37:55
Not sure how rich I will get with only 0.12btc, but I like the cat idea :)
Hookers, drugs and lambos are not my style.
If I ever get rich, I would buy my own place, try to have always a full fridge, buy an expensive gaming set up and buy few miners :)
I would spend my whole day trading and gaming :)
@_date: 2019-10-06 22:55:13
Don't worry about miners.
They are the reason why the price will never fall. Miners dictate the production price.
@_date: 2019-10-18 15:15:02
That's a sad story...
I wonder how many people lost their BTC the same way

Finally a wonderful story about Bitcoin.
The community considers only billionaires and lambos.
This is how Bitcoin makes regular people lifes more valuable without the need of owning 1000s of BTC.
We need more stories like this

Good job!
I've been doing the same thing regard gifting paper wallets to friends for birthdays. Nobody liked my gift xD
Who cares.
I wonder how you make a paper wallet? Online or you have a specific app to do so?

well.. the 2018 was really hard. I can't call victory yet

What coins do you suggest?
@_date: 2019-10-06 08:33:07
Is there a real possibility for Ledger and Trezor to get hacked?
They have a massive target on their back. 
I think it's a hacker wet dream to find a way to hack LedgerLive. I don't know how he could do that... should we be worried?
@_date: 2019-10-18 20:13:15
buying 0.5 btc back then for less than 200$ would make my life a lot more easier now
@_date: 2019-02-04 11:53:24
Finally someone who draw the problem in crypto industry in a sarcastic way.
Everyone is talking moon while wanting lambos and prestige.
Don't forget that this industry was not created so average people can get rich.
It was made to give back the power to the people.
If you sell your power opportunity back to the rich guys just so you can drive a lambo, you didn't understand what this is all about.
Good job mr. Brian Romero!!

Well... last month I saw some intentions and ideas from the bitcoin community to change the unit of measure from BTC to Satoshi.
Not sure if it will ever happen.
I think that only those who are watching the price of crypto in satoshis are to ones who understood what crypto is all about
@_date: 2019-01-05 11:41:44
1. Nobody can tell. But keep in mind that till 2020 there will be around 35.000.000 millionaires and just less then 14.000.000 BTC. Most will want the own at least 1 BTC
2. 5800$ should have been the bottom. Everything you buy bellow that is a strong buy
3. We will stop going down the day when the last seller sells his BTC at this stupid prices. Prbly we already reached the bottom. But it's hard to tell since news a manipulating the market pretty hard and I wouldn't be surprised to see more people dump for no reason. 
4. There are whales acumulating BTC at 3-4k$. The day nobody will sell them any more BTCs, they will place price walls. I don't see it as a bull run. It will look like the long flat tetris block that will drop verticaly in just few days. 
5. 
XRP - as much as true crypto guys, with morality in their heads, don't like xrp I don't think there is much we can do here. Maybe it's the most painless transition for common people into the crypto world. And it's a bridge that has to be made for people to reach the wanted destination. That said, I see a big boost incoming for XRP. 
LTC - not the most popular opinion here, but LTC has a bright future.
ETH - 2019 will be the year of stable coins. I'm pretty sure that &gt;70% of them will be built on ETHs platform. I see few trillion $ coming in.
6. ICO's won't die. They are perfect startups.
7. Alts will overtake the market.
8. No comment on that.
9. The 1st will be ETC. A bridge between ETH and ETC chains will do wonders for ETC when gas becomes too high on ETH.
The 2nd will be TRON. They could reach 6-4th place on cmc easily.
The 3rd will be Cardano. Not sure yet it the surprise will be good or bad, but surely we will be surprised. They'll make it or break it this year.
10. It's hard to find a non content maker media. Because to many people, just like me, have their own opinion and keep talking. Not every red candle means doom, not every green candle means moon.
11. There are too many whales, institutions, etc. on hold. Many more people are now involved, much more people have the information about crypto. 2015, 2016 and 2017 showed the path for the climb. Next spark of hype will bring millions of new investors to the market
12. Sure... coz cryptos where invented to be ruled by Bakkt...
13. Like whole this comment, another unpopular opinion... ASIC miners fucked the whole market. If we all kept mining with our humble computers there would be much more nodes, much less centralization and so on... I get chills when I hear that China has 70% of all the hash power.
14. I'm misunderstanding this last one.
But, logicaly what it means to hit the bottom? 
The bottom should be: "the price around the worlds average price of the cost of energy to mine 1 BTC.".
 That price is a little less coz nobody will build a mining farm in London when mining in Ukrain, Albania, Iceland or Belarus is way cheaper. So the average price of mining 1 BTC in those cheap electrcity countries. Thats anywhere between 4000-6000$.
Maybe there are some form of free energy so people can mine 1 BTC for free or only for the price of the hardware needed, but that should be a whole other topic. And that's why it will be harder and harder to comapre BTC to USD.
@_date: 2019-01-05 08:36:23
Highest buy I ever saw :)
In few years this will look like a good buy.. so, no worries

Bitcoin is hard to understand.
But the reality is that people don't understand fiat as well and nobody ask for understanding.
Crypto educators focus too much time explaining the tech behind Bitcoin to average people who don't mind about tech.
Average people use smartphones, computers, web browsers, facebook, instagram, microwaves ovens every day and nobody understands how they function. 
All the info average people want, is the end result of a certain tech.
The sooner we redesign the education about crypto, the sooner average people will start using it.
Many people I've encountered are afraid to be their own bank.
Many of them don't want to take the responsibility to manage their own money.
There is a huge business opportunity to open companies who will take care of average people cryptocurrenices. I know that it defys the whole purpose of crypto, but this is a question of laziness, fear and unwanted responsibility. 
I'm almost sure that banks will be the first who will offer crypto managing services.

Governments can get in or stay out. The wagon is leaving soon and won't turn back for anyone. 
Third world countries will be the fuel for true adoption of crypto currencies.
Just watch the incoming ISP war in Asia and Africa. That's the needed infrastructure for crypto to succeed.
Crypto will do well even without USA.

You are wrong. Satoshi called it "peer to peer electronic cash system"
